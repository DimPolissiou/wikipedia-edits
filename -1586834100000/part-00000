Also, patients with SS symptoms approach different [[Specialty (medicine)|specialities]] for treatment, which can make diagnosis difficult. Since dry eyes and dry mouth are very common symptoms, and frequently occur in people over 40, people often think the symptoms are age-related and ignore them. However, some medications can cause symptoms similar to those of SS. The combination of several tests, which can be done in a series, can eventually diagnose SS.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Fox, R. I 2005\">{{cite journal | author = Fox R.

Primary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome occurs by itself and secondary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome occurs when another [[connective tissue]] disease is present.\n\nBlood tests can be done to determine if a patient has high levels of antibodies that are indicative of the condition, such as [[antinuclear antibody]] (ANA) and [[rheumatoid factor]] (because SS frequently occurs secondary to rheumatoid arthritis), which are associated with autoimmune diseases. Typical SS ANA patterns are [[Anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies|SSA/Ro]] and [[Anti-nuclear antibody#Anti-Ro.2FSS-A and anti-La.2FSS-B|SSB/La]], of which Anti-SSB/La is far more specific; Anti-SSA/Ro is associated with numerous other autoimmune conditions, but are often present in SS. However, Anti-SSA and Anti-SSB tests are frequently not positive in SS.\n\nThe [[rose bengal]] test uses a stain that measures state and function of the [[lacrimal gland]]s. This test involves placing the [[non-toxic]] dye rose bengal on the eyes. The dye\u2019s distinctive colour helps in determining the state and functioning of tear film and the rate of tear evaporation.  Any distinctive colour change can indicate SS, but confirming the condition requires many related [[Medical test|diagnostic tools]].<ref name=\"Fox, R. I 2005\"/>\n\n[[Schirmer's test]] measures the production of tears: a strip of [[filter paper]] is held inside the lower eyelid for five minutes, and its wetness is then measured with a ruler. Producing less than {{Convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} of liquid is usually indicative of SS. This measurement analysis varies among people depending on other eye-related conditions and medications in use when the test is taken.<ref name=\"Fox, R. I 2005\"/> A [[slit-lamp examination]] can reveal dryness on the surface of the eye.\n\nSymptoms of dry mouth and dryness in the oral cavity are caused by the reduced production of saliva from the salivary glands ([[parotid gland]], [[submandibular gland]], and [[sublingual gland]]). To check the status of salivary glands and the production of saliva, a salivary flow-rate test is performed, in which the person is asked to spit as much as they can into a cup, and the resulting saliva sample is collected and weighed. This test's results can determine whether the salivary glands are functioning adequately. Not enough saliva produced could mean the person has SS.<ref name=\"Fox, R. I 2005\"/> An alternative test is non-stimulated whole saliva flow collection, in which the person spits into a [[test tube]] every minute for 15 minutes. A resultant collection of less than {{Convert|1.5|ml|abbr=on}} is considered a positive result.<ref name=\"Dr. J. Parks, Ancaster ON Canada\">Dr. J. Parks, Ancaster ON Canada</ref>\n\nA lip/salivary gland [[biopsy]] takes a tissue sample that can reveal [[lymphocyte]]s [[Gene cluster|clustered]] around salivary glands, and damage to these glands due to inflammation. This test involves removing a sample of tissue from a person\u2019s inner lip/salivary gland and examining it under a [[microscope]]. In addition, a [[sialogram]], a special [[X-ray]] test, is performed to see if any blockage is present in the salivary gland ducts (i.e. [[parotid duct]]) and the amount of saliva that flows into the mouth.<ref name=\"Fox, R. I 2005\"/>\n\nAlso, a radiological procedure is available as a reliable and accurate test for SS. A [[contrast agent]] is injected into the parotid duct, which opens from the cheek into the [[Human mouth|vestibule of the mouth]] opposite the neck of the upper second [[Molar (tooth)|molar tooth]]. [[Histopathology]] studies should show focal lymphocytic [[sialadenitis]]. Objective evidence of salivary gland involvement is tested through [[ultrasound]] examinations, the level of unstimulated whole salivary flow, a parotid [[sialography]] or salivary [[scintigraphy]], and autoantibodies against Ro (SSA) and/or La (SSB) antigens.\n\nSS can be excluded from people with past head and neck [[radiation therapy]], [[acquired immunodeficiency syndrome|acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)]], pre-existing [[lymphoma]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[graft-versus-host disease]], and use of [[Anticholinergic#Medical uses|anticholinergic drugs]].\n\n== Prevention ==\nThere is no prevention mechanism for SS due to its complexity as an autoimmune disorder. However, [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes can reduce the [[risk factors]] of getting SS or reduce the severity of the condition with patients who have already been diagnosed. [[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]] is strongly associated with inflammation that is mostly seen in many autoimmune related diseases including SS.

Instead, treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive.\n\n=== Eye care ===\nMoisture replacement therapies such as [[artificial tears]] may ease the symptoms of dry eyes. Some patients with more severe problems use [[goggles]] to increase local [[humidity]] or have [[punctal plugs]] inserted to help retain tears on the [[ocular]] surface for a longer time.\n\nAdditionally, [[cyclosporine]] (Restasis) is available by prescription to help treat chronic dry eye by suppressing the inflammation that disrupts tear secretion. [[Prescription drug]]s are also available that help to stimulate salivary flow, such as [[cevimeline]] (Evoxac) and pilocarpine. [[Salagen]], a manufactured form of [[pilocarpine]], can be used to help produce tears, as well as saliva in the mouth and intestines. It is derived from the [[Pilocarpus|jaborandi]] plant.<!-- .[17] [18][19] -->\n\n=== Vaginal dryness ===\nIn women with SS, vaginal dryness, [[vulvodynia]] and [[dyspareunia]] (painful [[sexual intercourse]]) are often reported; [[personal lubricants]] are recommended to help lessen irritation or pain that may result from dryness in the vaginal and [[vulva]] areas.<ref name=\"Fox, R. I 2005\"/>\n\n=== Musculoskeletal ===\n[[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) may be used to treat musculoskeletal symptoms. For individuals with severe [[Complication (medicine)|complications]], [[corticosteroids]] or [[immunosuppressive drugs]] may be prescribed, and sometimes [[IVIG]] (intravenous immunoglobulin). Also, [[disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs]] (DMARDs) such as [[methotrexate]] may be helpful. [[Hydroxychloroquine]] (Plaquenil) is another option and is generally considered safer than methotrexate. However, these prescribed drugs have a range of [[side effects]] such as [[nausea]], [[loss of appetite]], [[dizziness]], [[hair loss]], [[Abdominal pain|stomach aches/cramps]], [[headache]], [[liver toxicity]], and increased risk of [[infections]]. Also, people who take drugs to suppress the immune system are more likely to develop [[cancer]] later.<ref name=\"Fox, R.

Primary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome occurs by itself and secondary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome occurs when another [[connective tissue]] disease is present.\n\nBlood tests can be done to determine if a patient has high levels of antibodies that are indicative of the condition, such as [[antinuclear antibody]] (ANA) and [[rheumatoid factor]] (because SS frequently occurs secondary to rheumatoid arthritis), which are associated with autoimmune diseases. Typical SS ANA patterns are [[Anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies|SSA/Ro]] and [[Anti-nuclear antibody#Anti-Ro.2FSS-A and anti-La.2FSS-B|SSB/La]], of which Anti-SSB/La is far more specific; Anti-SSA/Ro is associated with numerous other autoimmune conditions, but are often present in SS. However, Anti-SSA and Anti-SSB tests are frequently not positive in SS.\n\nThe [[rose bengal]] test uses a stain that measures state and function of the [[lacrimal gland]]s. This test involves placing the [[non-toxic]] dye rose bengal on the eyes. The dye\u2019s distinctive colour helps in determining the state and functioning of tear film and the rate of tear evaporation.

To check the status of salivary glands and the production of saliva, a salivary flow-rate test is performed, in which the person is asked to spit as much as they can into a cup, and the resulting saliva sample is collected and weighed. This test's results can determine whether the salivary glands are functioning adequately. Not enough saliva produced could mean the person has SS.<ref name=\"Fox, R.

A [[contrast agent]] is injected into the parotid duct, which opens from the cheek into the [[Human mouth|vestibule of the mouth]] opposite the neck of the upper second [[Molar (tooth)|molar tooth]]. [[Histopathology]] studies should show focal lymphocytic [[sialadenitis]]. Objective evidence of salivary gland involvement is tested through [[ultrasound]] examinations, the level of unstimulated whole salivary flow, a parotid [[sialography]] or salivary [[scintigraphy]], and autoantibodies against Ro (SSA) and/or La (SSB) antigens.\n\nSS can be excluded from people with past head and neck [[radiation therapy]], [[acquired immunodeficiency syndrome|acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)]], pre-existing [[lymphoma]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[graft-versus-host disease]], and use of [[Anticholinergic#Medical uses|anticholinergic drugs]].\n\n== Prevention ==\nThere is no prevention mechanism for SS due to its complexity as an autoimmune disorder.

Instead, treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive.\n\n=== Eye care ===\nMoisture replacement therapies such as [[artificial tears]] may ease the symptoms of dry eyes. Some patients with more severe problems use [[goggles]] to increase local [[humidity]] or have [[punctal plugs]] inserted to help retain tears on the [[ocular]] surface for a longer time.\n\nAdditionally, [[cyclosporine]] (Restasis) is available by prescription to help treat chronic dry eye by suppressing the inflammation that disrupts tear secretion. [[Prescription drug]]s are also available that help to stimulate salivary flow, such as [[cevimeline]] (Evoxac) and pilocarpine. [[Salagen]], a manufactured form of [[pilocarpine]], can be used to help produce tears, as well as saliva in the mouth and intestines. It is derived from the [[Pilocarpus|jaborandi]] plant.<!-- .[17] [18][19] -->\n\n=== Vaginal dryness ===\nIn women with SS, vaginal dryness, [[vulvodynia]] and [[dyspareunia]] (painful [[sexual intercourse]]) are often reported; [[personal lubricants]] are recommended to help lessen irritation or pain that may result from dryness in the vaginal and [[vulva]] areas.<ref name=\"Fox, R. I 2005\"/>\n\n=== Musculoskeletal ===\n[[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) may be used to treat musculoskeletal symptoms. For individuals with severe [[Complication (medicine)|complications]], [[corticosteroids]] or [[immunosuppressive drugs]] may be prescribed, and sometimes [[IVIG]] (intravenous immunoglobulin). Also, [[disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs]] (DMARDs) such as [[methotrexate]] may be helpful. [[Hydroxychloroquine]] (Plaquenil) is another option and is generally considered safer than methotrexate. However, these prescribed drugs have a range of [[side effects]] such as [[nausea]], [[loss of appetite]], [[dizziness]], [[hair loss]], [[Abdominal pain|stomach aches/cramps]], [[headache]], [[liver toxicity]], and increased risk of [[infections]]. Also, people who take drugs to suppress the immune system are more likely to develop [[cancer]] later.<ref name=\"Fox, R. I 2005\"/>\n\n=== Systemic ===\nFor systemic symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain, myositis and [[neuropathy]], biologic [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressant]] drugs such as [[rituximab]] and [[belimumab]] that work via [[B-cell]] pathology are often used and have less toxic profiles than traditional immunosuppressive regimens.\n\n=== Dental care ===\n[[Preventive healthcare|Preventive]] [[dentistry|dental]] treatment is also necessary (and often overlooked by the patient), as the lack of saliva associated with xerostomia creates an ideal environment for the [[Cell growth|proliferation]] of bacteria that cause [[dental caries|cavities]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Xin | first1 = W | last2 = Leung | first2 = KC | last3 = Lo | first3 = EC | last4 = Mok | first4 = MY | last5 = Leung | first5 = MH | year = 2016| title = A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of fluoride varnish in preventing dental caries of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients | journal = BMC Oral Health | volume = 16 | issue = 1| page = 102 | doi = 10.1186/s12903-016-0296-7 | pmc = 5034648 | pmid = 27664129 }}</ref> Treatments include at-home [[topical]] [[Fluoride therapy|fluoride application]] to strengthen tooth enamel and frequent teeth cleanings by a dental hygienist.

This treatment regimen is the same as for all xerostomia patients\u2014such as those undergoing head and neck radiation therapy, which often damages the salivary glands, which are more susceptible to radiation than other body tissues.\n\n== Prognosis ==\nPublished studies on the survival of SS patients are limited in varied respects, perhaps owing to the relatively small sample sizes, and secondary SS is associated with other autoimmune diseases. However, results from a number of studies indicated, compared to other autoimmune diseases, SS is associated with a notably high incidence of malignant [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] (NHL).<ref name=Voulgarelis2010/> NHL is the cancer derived from white blood cells.

{"title_page": "Valleyspeak", "text_new": "{{short description|American sociolect}}\n{{Contradict-other|Discourse marker|date=February 2019}}\n\n'''Valleyspeak''' or '''Valspeak''' is an American [[sociolect]], originally of the [[San Fernando Valley]] in [[Southern California]]. It is associated with young, upper-middle-class white women called [[Valley girl]]s, although elements of it have spread to other demographics, including men called \"Val dudes\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-25232387|title=More men speaking in girls' 'dialect', study shows|last=Hogenboom|first=Melissa|date=2013-12-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-19|language=en-GB}}</ref> This sociolect became an international fad for a certain period in the 1980s and 1990s, with a peak period from around 1981 to 1985. According to the Los Angeles Almanac, Valleyspeak is often characterized by both the steady use of [[High rising terminal|uptalk]] and its vocabulary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laalmanac.com/LA/la10c.php|title=Valspeak or Valley Speak|website=www.laalmanac.com|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Many phrases and elements of Valleyspeak, along with [[Surf culture|surfer slang]] and [[skateboarding]] [[slang]], have become stable elements of the [[California English]] dialect lexicon, and in some cases wider [[American English]] such as the widespread use of \"like\" as a [[discourse marker]].\n\n== Language ideology ==\nDue to its place at the center of the entertainment industry, California is one of the main sources worldwide for new cultural and youth trends, including those of language. This lends itself to explicit language ideologies about dialects in the area as they receive more scrutiny than dialects in other nearby regions. Linguistic characteristics of \"[[valley girl]]\" or \"California\" speak are often thought to be \"silly\" and \"superficial\" and seen as a sign of low intelligence. Speakers are also often perceived as \"materialistic\" and \"air-headed\". The use of \"like\" or the quotative phrase \"be like\" are often ideologically linked to California and valley speak despite the now widespread use of the terms among youth, which results to them also receiving the \"superficial\" cast. In the national understanding, California speech is thought to be a product of the combination of valley girl and surfer dude speech, and \"is associated with good English, but never proper\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA study on regional language ideologies done in California in 2007 found that, despite its prevalence and association with California in past decades, Californians themselves do not consider \"valley girls\" to be an overly prevalent social or linguistic group within the state. State residents listed factors such as immigrant populations and North-South regional slang as more relevant than valley speak within the state.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bucholtz |first=M. |last2=Bermudez |first2=N. |last3=Fung |first3=V. |last4=Edwards |first4=L. |last5=Vargas |first5=R. |year=2007 |title=Hella Nor Cal or Totally So Cal?: The Perceptual Dialectology of California |journal=Journal of English Linguistics |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=325\u2013352 |doi=10.1177/0075424207307780 |url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt6492j904/qt6492j904.pdf?t=nukrb0 }}</ref>\n\nMany researchers, such as Amanda Ritchart, a graduate student who had studied linguistics at the University of California, San Diego, has analyzed 23-year olds (college age students) of many socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnicities, specifically in the Southern California region.

Instead, it provides time for the speaker to formulate what they will say next. The word is always unstressed when used in this way. It is important to note that \"like\" does not always function as a discourse marker in Valspeak. Consider the following two sentences: \"It was like 8 feet deep\" and \"I think that, like, it is entertaining.\" Even though both sentences contain the word \"like,\" they employ it differently. In the former, \"like\" serves as an adverb that is synonymous with \"approximately,\" whereas the latter \"like\" is a discourse marker, adding no additional meaning to the sentence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://partofspeech.org/what-part-of-speech-is-like/|title=What Part of Speech is \u201cLIKE\u201d?|date=2014-11-29|website=Part of Speech|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Furthermore, \"like\" is frequently used to introduce quoted speech.

This lends itself to explicit language ideologies about dialects in the area as they receive more scrutiny than dialects in other nearby regions. Linguistic characteristics of \"[[valley girl]]\" or \"California\" speak are often thought to be \"silly\" and \"superficial\" and seen as a sign of low intelligence. Speakers are also often perceived as \"materialistic\" and \"air-headed\". The use of \"like\" or the quotative phrase \"be like\" are often ideologically linked to California and valley speak despite the now widespread use of the terms among youth, which results to them also receiving the \"superficial\" cast. In the national understanding, California speech is thought to be a product of the combination of valley girl and surfer dude speech, and \"is associated with good English, but never proper\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA study on regional language ideologies done in California in 2007 found that, despite its prevalence and association with California in past decades, Californians themselves do not consider \"valley girls\" to be an overly prevalent social or linguistic group within the state.
