{"title_page": "Cross-platform play", "text_new": "In [[video game]]s with online gaming functionality, '''cross-platform play''', '''crossplay''', or '''cross-play''' describes the ability of [[Gamer|players]] using different video game hardware to play with each other simultaneously. It is commonly applied to the ability for players using a game on a specific [[video game console]] to play alongside a player on a different hardware platform such as another console or a computer. A related concept is '''cross-save''', where the player's progress in a game is stored in separate servers, and can be continued in the game but on a different hardware platform.\n\nCross-play is related to but distinct from the notion of [[cross-platform]] development, which uses software languages and tools to enable deployment of software on multiple platforms. Cross-platform play is also a distinct concept from the ability to allow a player to play a game on different hardware platforms, often only having to purchase the title for one single system to have access to it on other systems, and retaining their progress in the game through the use of [[cloud storage]] or similar techniques.\n\nCross-platform play, while technically feasible with today's computer hardware, generally is impeded by two factors. One factor is the difference in control schemes between personal computers and consoles, with the keyboard-and-mouse controls typically giving computer players an unfair advantage that cannot be easily remedied. The second factor relates to the closed online services used on consoles that are designed to provide a safe and consistent environment for its players that require the businesses' cooperation to open up for cross-platform play. Up through September 2018, [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] had restricted [[PlayStation 4]] cross-platform play with other consoles, creating a rift between players of popular games like ''[[Rocket League]]'' and ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]''. In September 2018, Sony changed their stance, and had opened up beta-testing for ''Fortnite'' cross-platform play. Sony officially stated it will allow any developers to support cross-platform play in October 2019.\n\n==Background==\nVideo games are frequently developed as [[cross-platform]] software products, using standard [[Library (computing)|software libraries]], [[game engine]]s, and [[scripting language]]s that isolate platform-specific details from the specific elements for the game itself. Such tools enable games to be released simultaneously for many platforms.\n\nWith the availability of the Internet, games have included online multiplayer components, allowing two or more users to play simultaneously on different computer systems. Games released for a platform may be able to take advantage of platform-specific networking libraries to accomplish this, such as the [[Winsock]] layer for [[Microsoft Windows]]. These games would not be able to be played cross-platform with other versions released on other systems. Instead, most games with online components and developed for multiple platforms generally use standard [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP-type]] functions for communication between players' clients, or between a client and a game server, nullifying the intrinsic differences between hardware platforms.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131830/simultaneous_crossplatform_game_.php | title = Simultaneous Cross-Platform Game Development | work = [[Gamasutra]] | date = January 24, 2000 | accessdate = March 14, 2016 | first = Eric | last = Lengyel }}</ref>\n\nThere are some practical limitations for cross-platform play. In games where the player's computer or console acts as the server, the hardware capabilities may place limits on the number of players that that server can host, and thus preventing cross-platform play. Hardware also plays an issue in considering how much the player can customize the game on a computer to run at a high framerate, while console versions are fixed to run at the optimal experience on the set hardware configuration.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/21/the-dream-of-cross-platform-play-vs-the-reality | title=  Cross-Platform Play Is Way Harder Than You Might Think | first = Nathanael | last = Peacock | date=  March 20, 2017 | accessdate = March 20, 2017 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref>\n\nThe most common limitation for supporting cross-platform play from a developer's stance is the difference in control schemes between consoles and computers. Computers with  [[Game controller#Keyboard .26 Mouse|keyboard and mouse]] controls on personal computers are generally considered to have a significant advantage in games that require aiming, such as [[first-person shooters]], over analog controllers for consoles. Console games are then subsequently developed with features such as aim assist to make up for the lack of precision controls.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/246176/can_a_gamepad_beat_a_keyboard_and_mouse_.html | title = Can a Gamepad Beat a Keyboard and Mouse? | work = [[PC World]] | author = Miller, Patrick | author2 = Ralph, Nate | author3 = Wawro, Alex | last-author-amp = yes | date = December 13, 2011  | accessdate = March 16, 2016 }}</ref>  In 2010, Rahul Sood, the president of [[Voodoo PC]], stated that Microsoft had terminated cross-platform play between Xbox 360 and computer players for an upcoming game claiming that even skilled console players \"got destroyed every time\" in matches against computer players of mediocre skill due to the difference between controller and keyboard-and-mouse controls, and thus would be seen as an embarrassment to the Xbox 360.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesradar.com/pc-gamers-destroyed-console-gamers-in-tests-says-voodoo-pc-founder/ | title = PC gamers 'destroyed' console gamers in tests, says Voodoo PC founder | first = Michael | last =Grimm |date = July 23, 2010 | accessdate = March 21, 2016 | work = [[GamesRadar]] }}</ref> Microsoft's Senior Director of Computer and Mobile Gaming Kevin Unangst countered this point, stating that Microsoft's internal testing found that much of the issues related to control scheme difference can be mitigated through a game's design and balance.<ref name=\"pcworld gfwl\"/> [[Blizzard Entertainment]] is seeking to implement cross-platform play between the [[Xbox One]] and [[PlayStation 4]] versions of its game ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', but will not also include the Windows platform specifically due to the advantage keyboard-mouse players have over controllers, which greatly affects performance in the fast-paced game.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-cross-platform-play-for-overwatch-in-part-becau/1100-6432073/ | title = No Cross-Platform Play for Overwatch in Part Because PC Players Might Have Advantage | first = Eddie | last = Makuch | date = June 5, 2016 | accessdate = June 13, 2016 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> [[Cliff Bleszinski]] believed that cross-platform play for his game ''[[LawBreakers]]'' was a \"pipe dream\", as he anticipated that by placing tools such as aim assist to help console players match computer players, computer players would be upset at the handicap this introduced, and the player base would react negatively towards this.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/05/lawbreakers-dev-pcconsole-cross-platform-play-is-dumb/ | title = Lawbreakers dev: PC/console cross-platform play is \"dumb\" | first = Kyle | last=  Orland | date =  May 22, 2017 | accessdate = May 22, 2017 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref>\n\nProviding cross-platform play is seen as a means to keep a game's player base large even several months out after a game's release.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2016/03/21/rocket-league-devs-already-know-how-to-add-cross-network-multiplayer/ | title = Rocket League devs already know how to add cross-network multiplayer | first = Sharif | last = Saed | date = March 21, 2016 | accessdate = March 21, 2016 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nGenerally, cross-platform play between personal computers of different operating systems is readily enabled using standard communication protocols, and only requires the game to be appropriately ported to these other systems; the computer platform is considered to be very open due to this. Though digital online services that operate on the computer have become popular since around 2010, these systems typically remain open, providing the developer with tools to take advantage of cross-platform play. For example, [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]'s online game service, [[Steam (software)|Steam]] was initially built for Windows computers, but in 2010 expanded to [[OS X]] systems, and in 2013 to [[Linux]] (including Valve's customized [[SteamOS]]). The Steamworks API offered to developers through the service enables cross-platform play to uses on these different operating systems while taking advantage of the friends, communication, and matchmaking features offered by Steam.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2010/03/steam-mac/ | title = Valve Brings Hit Games, Steam Service to Mac | first = Chris | last = Kohler | date = March 8, 2010 |  accessdate = March 17, 2016 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref>\n\n===Relating to consoles===\nPrior to 2006, hardware consoles typically lacked built-in Internet connections, often requiring special hardware to be able to connect to the Internet. This enabled some games to be deployed as cross-platform titles. The notable exception was the 1998 [[Sega Dreamcast]] which all consoles came equipped with a modem and could play with PC players with such games as [[4x4 Evo]], [[Maximum Pool]], [[Quake 3 Arena]] and [[Phantasy Star Online]] (Preset phrases are automatically translated between languages, and custom emoticons are also supported).

Though providing benefits to the player, these online services also aid the managing company to maintain a consistent and attractive experience for its users, assuring games, updates, and other content meet both desirable quality and content restrictions as to draw new players to these consoles.\n\nHistorically, cross-platform play with consoles has been very limited as a result of these services, and the ability to have console games with cross-platform play is considered to be a \"holy grail\" within the video game sector.<ref name=\"arstech oct2013\">{{Cite web | url= https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/console-makers-making-noises-about-relaxing-multiplayer-exclusivity/ | title = Console makers making noises about relaxing multiplayer exclusivity | first=  Kyle | last = Orland | date = October 15, 2013 | accessdate  = March 17, 2016 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref>\n\nOne technical challenge that faces console-based cross-platform play is the network communication between platforms, managing the different protocols used by each service.<ref name=\"arstech march2016\"/> However, the technical limitations can be overcome, with at least three developers stating they could enable cross-platform play within a day once they were allowed to do so.<ref name=\"rl cp\"/><ref name=\"ark cp\"/> A \"configuration issue\" briefly allowed computer, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One players to play alongside each other in the online cooperative game ''[[Fortnite]]'' in mid-September 2017.

While [[Epic Games]] corrected the configuration and stated this was a mistake, the brief situations demonstrated that technical barriers to cross-platform play can be met.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/fortnite-devs-inadvertently-prove-cross-console-play-is-possible/ | title = Fortnite devs inadvertently prove cross-console play is possible | first = Kyle | last= Orland | date = September 18, 2017 | accessdate = September 18, 2017 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref> Later in March 2018, Epic announced plans to take the spinoff title, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and mobile devices, with cross-platform play enabled between computer, PlayStation 4 and mobile, and computer, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and mobile.<ref name=\"verge_fbr\">{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/10/17104392/fortnite-ps4-xbox-one-cross-play-support | title = Fortnite PS4 vs. Xbox One cross-play isn't happening, but both consoles can play against PC or mobile | first = Tom | last =Warren | date = March 12, 2018 | accessdate = March 12, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}</ref>\n\nOnce these technical challenges can be overcome, the primarily limiting factor for cross-platform play has been the terms of service and acceptable use policy that developers and players must abide by when using the consoles' online services.

Kyle Orland for ''[[Ars Technica]]'' notes that if a player wants to continue playing new games with friends, the lack of cross-platform play requires them to continue to purchase the new games for that console platform, creating \"powerful network effects\".<ref name=\"arstech oct2013\"/><ref name=\"arstech march2016\">{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/why-microsoft-is-finally-pushing-for-cross-platform-online-gaming/ |title = Why Microsoft is finally pushing for cross-platform online gaming | date = March 14, 2016 | accessdate = March 16, 2016 | work = [[Ars Technica]] | first = Kyle | last = Orland }}</ref>\n\n====Microsoft====\nMicrosoft has explored cross-platform play between their Xbox consoles and players on Windows machines uses services under its purview.

The game supports cross-platform play across personal computer, Xbox One, and mobile devices, with players normally able to use a single Epic Games account, which may be linked to a platform-specific account, to carry over progress and purchases between any of those platforms; the Nintendo Switch version also works in this same manner. However, players found that if their Epic Games account was tied to a [[PlayStation Network]] account, they could not use that profile on the Switch or other versions of the game, requiring them to either create a new Epic account, or unlinking their PlayStation Network account from their Epic account which completely resets the player's progress. The PlayStation 4 version also remained limited in only allowing its players to cross-platform play with personal computer and mobile devices and not the Switch or Xbox One versions.<ref name=\"polygon-fortnite-ps4-switch-restriction\">{{cite web|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|title=Fortnite accounts that have been used on the PS4 are blocked on Switch (and vice versa)|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/12/17453978/this-fortnite-account-is-associated-with-a-platform-which-does-not-allow-it-to-operate-on-switch|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=2018-06-12|date=2018-06-12|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"mashable-fortnite-cross-platform-restrictions\">{{cite web|last=Beck|first=Kellen|title=Sony's lack of cross-compatibility in 'Fortnite' is a bad sign|url=https://mashable.com/2018/06/12/sony-cross-compatibility-fortnite/#flLkvbpVTmqW|website=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=2018-06-12|date=2018-06-12|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Nintendo affirmed that this was a decision made by Sony, as they otherwise would want to be open to all forms of cross-platform play.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/13/e3-2018-nintendo-on-importance-of-cross-play-following-fortnite-account-issue |title=E3 2018: Nintendo on Importance of Cross-Play Following Fortnite Account Issue |last=Dornbush |first=Jonathon |date=June 13, 2018 |website=[[IGN]] |access-date=September 22, 2018}}</ref> Many gamers and even [[video game journalism|video game journalists]] accused Sony of forcing the restrictions to prevent PlayStation 4 players from playing on other platforms.<ref name=\"polygon-fortnite-ps4-switch-restriction\" /><ref name=\"mashable-fortnite-cross-platform-restrictions\" /><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/13/17459340/sony-ps4-fortnite-cross-play-switch | title = Sony's Fortnite cross-play nightmare isn't going away | first=  Ben | last = Kuchera | date = June 13, 2018 | accessdate = June 13, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> Sony stated in response that they are still open to what players wanted, and that \"With... more than 80 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network, we've built a huge community of gamers who can play together on Fortnite and all online titles\".<ref name=\"bbc fbr\">{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44477524 | title = Sony faces growing Fortnite backlash at E3 | first = Leo | last = Kelion | date = June 14, 2018 | accessdate = June 14, 2018 | work = [[BBC]] }}</ref> Journalists took Sony's reaction as a message from Sony that providing cross-platform play on other consoles would be a threat to [[Eighth generation of video game consoles#Comparison|the market dominance of the PlayStation 4]], which, at the time, has the current largest number of users compared to Xbox One or Nintendo Switch.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17454606/fortnite-nintendo-switch-ps4-block-accounts-cross-play-e3-2018 | title = Fortnite fans are furious at Sony for ruining their handheld dreams | first = Tom | last = Warren | date = June 12, 2018 | accessdate = June 14, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/15/17463556/fortnite-ps4-switch-cross-platform-sony | title = How Fortnite trapped Sony, and what happens next | first = Ben | last = Kuchera | date = June 15, 2018 | accessdate = June 15, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> [[John Smedley (video games)|John Smedley]], a former president of Sony Online Entertainment (now [[Daybreak Game Company]]), stated that during his time with Sony, the reason the executives gave him for rejecting cross-platform play support was simply a financial motive, claiming, \"they didn't like someone buying something on an Xbox and it being used on a Playstation\".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-19-ex-sony-dev-says-ps4-console-cross-platform-block-is-all-about-the-money | title = Ex-Sony dev says PS4 / console cross-platform block is all about the money | first = Wesley | last=  Yin-Poole | date = June 19, 2018 | accessdate = June 19, 2018 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> Sony's stocks fell approximately 2% in the days after this event, largely due to outrage from the large ''Fortnite'' player base.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/14/fortnite-playstation-4-gamers-outraged-over-switch-cross-play-issue.html | title = Sony shares slide amid gamer backlash over 'Fortnite' PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch issue | first = Arjun | last = Krahpal | date= June 14, 2018 | accessdate = June 14, 2018 | work =[[CNBC]] }}</ref>\n\nIn late June 2018, Sony's [[Shawn Layden]] told ''[[Eurogamer]]'' that the company is evaluating their stance on cross-platform play following the ''Fortnite'' issues.

Mobile games are developed with recognition of connection speed limitations of cellular networks, and thus most multiplayer games are often turn-based strategy games rather than real-time action games. Many multiplayer games for mobile devices are asynchronous, where players individually complete turns or actions, these actions sent to central services and pushed out to the other players that may be impacted by those actions.\n\nThere are mobile games that do feature synchronous cross-platform play, typically using centralized services to normalize out platform choices. A common example is ''[[Hearthstone]]'' which enables mobile players to challenge players on any other platform that the game has been released on, including computers.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2015/03/19/hearthstone-iphone-android-cross-play/ | title = Cross-platform play confirmed for Hearthstone on smartphones | first = Stephany | last = Nunneley |  date = March 19, 2015 | accessdate = March 21, 2016 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref> Microsoft introduced server-side Realms in June 2016 to enable ''[[Minecraft]]'' players on Windows, iOS, and Android devices to play together, with Xbox One set to be included in 2017 and eventually support for [[virtual reality]] hardware.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/e3/2016/6/13/11922908/minecraft-cross-platform-e3-2016 | title = Minecraft gets cross-platform play later this year | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = June 13, 2016 | accessdate = June 13, 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> ''Minecraft''{{'}}s \"Bedrock\" edition unifies play across Windows 10, mobile, Xbox One, and [[Nintendo Switch]] versions,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/minecraft-is-unifying-nearly-all-of-its-versions-across-all-platforms-except-sony-439216.phtml | title = Minecraft is unifying nearly all of its versions across all platforms, except Sony | first = Chris | last = Carter | date = June 11, 2017 | accessdate = June 11, 2017 | work  =[[Destructoid]] }}</ref> with PlayStation 4 cross-platform play added in December 2019,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-12-09-finally-playstation-gets-cross-platform-minecraft-tomorrow | title = Finally, PlayStation gets cross-platform Minecraft tomorrow | first=  Tom | last= Phillips | date = December 9, 2019 | accessdate = December 9, 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> while ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' mobile versions were built with cross-platform play with computers and consoles.<ref name=\"verge_fbr\"/><ref name=\"sony_cp_fbr\"/>\n\n===Other hardware===\n[[CCP Games]] have announced they plan to enable cross-platform play for their [[virtual reality]] (VR) title, ''[[Eve: Valkyrie]]'', between the three major VR systems:  the [[Oculus Rift]], the [[HTC Vive]], and [[PlayStation VR]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/21/11477562/eve-valkyrie-cross-platform-play | title = Eve: Valkyrie will support cross-platform play between Rift, Vive and PlayStation VR | first = Ben | last = Kuchera | date = April 21, 2016 | accessdate = April 21, 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of video games that support cross-platform play]]\n*[[Cross-platform software]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Video game terminology]]\n[[Category:Video games with cross-platform play| ]]\n", "text_old": "In [[video game]]s with online gaming functionality, '''cross-platform play''', '''crossplay''' or '''cross-play''', describes the ability of [[Gamer|players]] using different video game hardware to play with each other simultaneously. It is commonly applied to the ability for players using a game on a specific [[video game console]] to play alongside a player on a different hardware platform such as another console or a computer. A related concept is '''cross-save''', where the player's progress in a game is stored in separate servers, and can be continued in the game but on a different hardware platform.\n\nCross-play is related to but distinct from the notion of [[cross-platform]] development, which uses software languages and tools to enable deployment of software on multiple platforms. Cross-platform play is also a distinct concept from the ability to allow a player to play a game on different hardware platforms, often only having to purchase the title for one single system to have access to it on other systems, and retaining their progress in the game through the use of [[cloud storage]] or similar techniques.\n\nCross-platform play, while technically feasible with today's computer hardware, generally is impeded by two factors. One factor is the difference in control schemes between personal computers and consoles, with the keyboard-and-mouse controls typically giving computer players an unfair advantage that cannot be easily remedied. The second factor relates to the closed online services used on consoles that are designed to provide a safe and consistent environment for its players that require the businesses' cooperation to open up for cross-platform play. Up through September 2018, [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] had restricted [[PlayStation 4]] cross-platform play with other consoles, creating a rift between players of popular games like ''[[Rocket League]]'' and ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]''. In September 2018, Sony changed their stance, and had opened up beta-testing for ''Fortnite'' cross-platform play. Sony officially stated it will allow any developers to support cross-platform play in October 2019.\n\n==Background==\nVideo games are frequently developed as [[cross-platform]] software products, using standard [[Library (computing)|software libraries]], [[game engine]]s, and [[scripting language]]s that isolate platform-specific details from the specific elements for the game itself. Such tools enable games to be released simultaneously for many platforms.\n\nWith the availability of the Internet, games have included online multiplayer components, allowing two or more users to play simultaneously on different computer systems. Games released for a platform may be able to take advantage of platform-specific networking libraries to accomplish this, such as the [[Winsock]] layer for [[Microsoft Windows]]. These games would not be able to be played cross-platform with other versions released on other systems. Instead, most games with online components and developed for multiple platforms generally use standard [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP-type]] functions for communication between players' clients, or between a client and a game server, nullifying the intrinsic differences between hardware platforms.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131830/simultaneous_crossplatform_game_.php | title = Simultaneous Cross-Platform Game Development | work = [[Gamasutra]] | date = January 24, 2000 | accessdate = March 14, 2016 | first = Eric | last = Lengyel }}</ref>\n\nThere are some practical limitations for cross-platform play. In games where the player's computer or console acts as the server, the hardware capabilities may place limits on the number of players that that server can host, and thus preventing cross-platform play. Hardware also plays an issue in considering how much the player can customize the game on a computer to run at a high framerate, while console versions are fixed to run at the optimal experience on the set hardware configuration.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/21/the-dream-of-cross-platform-play-vs-the-reality | title=  Cross-Platform Play Is Way Harder Than You Might Think | first = Nathanael | last = Peacock | date=  March 20, 2017 | accessdate = March 20, 2017 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref>\n\nThe most common limitation for supporting cross-platform play from a developer's stance is the difference in control schemes between consoles and computers. Computers with  [[Game controller#Keyboard .26 Mouse|keyboard and mouse]] controls on personal computers are generally considered to have a significant advantage in games that require aiming, such as [[first-person shooters]], over analog controllers for consoles. Console games are then subsequently developed with features such as aim assist to make up for the lack of precision controls.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/246176/can_a_gamepad_beat_a_keyboard_and_mouse_.html | title = Can a Gamepad Beat a Keyboard and Mouse? | work = [[PC World]] | author = Miller, Patrick | author2 = Ralph, Nate | author3 = Wawro, Alex | last-author-amp = yes | date = December 13, 2011  | accessdate = March 16, 2016 }}</ref>  In 2010, Rahul Sood, the president of [[Voodoo PC]], stated that Microsoft had terminated cross-platform play between Xbox 360 and computer players for an upcoming game claiming that even skilled console players \"got destroyed every time\" in matches against computer players of mediocre skill due to the difference between controller and keyboard-and-mouse controls, and thus would be seen as an embarrassment to the Xbox 360.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesradar.com/pc-gamers-destroyed-console-gamers-in-tests-says-voodoo-pc-founder/ | title = PC gamers 'destroyed' console gamers in tests, says Voodoo PC founder | first = Michael | last =Grimm |date = July 23, 2010 | accessdate = March 21, 2016 | work = [[GamesRadar]] }}</ref> Microsoft's Senior Director of Computer and Mobile Gaming Kevin Unangst countered this point, stating that Microsoft's internal testing found that much of the issues related to control scheme difference can be mitigated through a game's design and balance.<ref name=\"pcworld gfwl\"/> [[Blizzard Entertainment]] is seeking to implement cross-platform play between the [[Xbox One]] and [[PlayStation 4]] versions of its game ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', but will not also include the Windows platform specifically due to the advantage keyboard-mouse players have over controllers, which greatly affects performance in the fast-paced game.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-cross-platform-play-for-overwatch-in-part-becau/1100-6432073/ | title = No Cross-Platform Play for Overwatch in Part Because PC Players Might Have Advantage | first = Eddie | last = Makuch | date = June 5, 2016 | accessdate = June 13, 2016 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref> [[Cliff Bleszinski]] believed that cross-platform play for his game ''[[LawBreakers]]'' was a \"pipe dream\", as he anticipated that by placing tools such as aim assist to help console players match computer players, computer players would be upset at the handicap this introduced, and the player base would react negatively towards this.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/05/lawbreakers-dev-pcconsole-cross-platform-play-is-dumb/ | title = Lawbreakers dev: PC/console cross-platform play is \"dumb\" | first = Kyle | last=  Orland | date =  May 22, 2017 | accessdate = May 22, 2017 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref>\n\nProviding cross-platform play is seen as a means to keep a game's player base large even several months out after a game's release.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2016/03/21/rocket-league-devs-already-know-how-to-add-cross-network-multiplayer/ | title = Rocket League devs already know how to add cross-network multiplayer | first = Sharif | last = Saed | date = March 21, 2016 | accessdate = March 21, 2016 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nGenerally, cross-platform play between personal computers of different operating systems is readily enabled using standard communication protocols, and only requires the game to be appropriately ported to these other systems; the computer platform is considered to be very open due to this. Though digital online services that operate on the computer have become popular since around 2010, these systems typically remain open, providing the developer with tools to take advantage of cross-platform play. For example, [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]'s online game service, [[Steam (software)|Steam]] was initially built for Windows computers, but in 2010 expanded to [[OS X]] systems, and in 2013 to [[Linux]] (including Valve's customized [[SteamOS]]). The Steamworks API offered to developers through the service enables cross-platform play to uses on these different operating systems while taking advantage of the friends, communication, and matchmaking features offered by Steam.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2010/03/steam-mac/ | title = Valve Brings Hit Games, Steam Service to Mac | first = Chris | last = Kohler | date = March 8, 2010 |  accessdate = March 17, 2016 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref>\n\n===Relating to consoles===\nPrior to 2006, hardware consoles typically lacked built-in Internet connections, often requiring special hardware to be able to connect to the Internet.

However, players found that if their Epic Games account was tied to a [[PlayStation Network]] account, they could not use that profile on the Switch or other versions of the game, requiring them to either create a new Epic account, or unlinking their PlayStation Network account from their Epic account which completely resets the player's progress. The PlayStation 4 version also remained limited in only allowing its players to cross-platform play with personal computer and mobile devices and not the Switch or Xbox One versions.<ref name=\"polygon-fortnite-ps4-switch-restriction\">{{cite web|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|title=Fortnite accounts that have been used on the PS4 are blocked on Switch (and vice versa)|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/12/17453978/this-fortnite-account-is-associated-with-a-platform-which-does-not-allow-it-to-operate-on-switch|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=2018-06-12|date=2018-06-12|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"mashable-fortnite-cross-platform-restrictions\">{{cite web|last=Beck|first=Kellen|title=Sony's lack of cross-compatibility in 'Fortnite' is a bad sign|url=https://mashable.com/2018/06/12/sony-cross-compatibility-fortnite/#flLkvbpVTmqW|website=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=2018-06-12|date=2018-06-12|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Nintendo affirmed that this was a decision made by Sony, as they otherwise would want to be open to all forms of cross-platform play.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/13/e3-2018-nintendo-on-importance-of-cross-play-following-fortnite-account-issue |title=E3 2018: Nintendo on Importance of Cross-Play Following Fortnite Account Issue |last=Dornbush |first=Jonathon |date=June 13, 2018 |website=[[IGN]] |access-date=September 22, 2018}}</ref> Many gamers and even [[video game journalism|video game journalists]] accused Sony of forcing the restrictions to prevent PlayStation 4 players from playing on other platforms.<ref name=\"polygon-fortnite-ps4-switch-restriction\" /><ref name=\"mashable-fortnite-cross-platform-restrictions\" /><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/13/17459340/sony-ps4-fortnite-cross-play-switch | title = Sony's Fortnite cross-play nightmare isn't going away | first=  Ben | last = Kuchera | date = June 13, 2018 | accessdate = June 13, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> Sony stated in response that they are still open to what players wanted, and that \"With... more than 80 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network, we've built a huge community of gamers who can play together on Fortnite and all online titles\".<ref name=\"bbc fbr\">{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44477524 | title = Sony faces growing Fortnite backlash at E3 | first = Leo | last = Kelion | date = June 14, 2018 | accessdate = June 14, 2018 | work = [[BBC]] }}</ref> Journalists took Sony's reaction as a message from Sony that providing cross-platform play on other consoles would be a threat to [[Eighth generation of video game consoles#Comparison|the market dominance of the PlayStation 4]], which, at the time, has the current largest number of users compared to Xbox One or Nintendo Switch.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17454606/fortnite-nintendo-switch-ps4-block-accounts-cross-play-e3-2018 | title = Fortnite fans are furious at Sony for ruining their handheld dreams | first = Tom | last = Warren | date = June 12, 2018 | accessdate = June 14, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/15/17463556/fortnite-ps4-switch-cross-platform-sony | title = How Fortnite trapped Sony, and what happens next | first = Ben | last = Kuchera | date = June 15, 2018 | accessdate = June 15, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> [[John Smedley (video games)|John Smedley]], a former president of Sony Online Entertainment (now [[Daybreak Game Company]]), stated that during his time with Sony, the reason the executives gave him for rejecting cross-platform play support was simply a financial motive, claiming, \"they didn't like someone buying something on an Xbox and it being used on a Playstation\".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-19-ex-sony-dev-says-ps4-console-cross-platform-block-is-all-about-the-money | title = Ex-Sony dev says PS4 / console cross-platform block is all about the money | first = Wesley | last=  Yin-Poole | date = June 19, 2018 | accessdate = June 19, 2018 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> Sony's stocks fell approximately 2% in the days after this event, largely due to outrage from the large ''Fortnite'' player base.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/14/fortnite-playstation-4-gamers-outraged-over-switch-cross-play-issue.html | title = Sony shares slide amid gamer backlash over 'Fortnite' PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch issue | first = Arjun | last = Krahpal | date= June 14, 2018 | accessdate = June 14, 2018 | work =[[CNBC]] }}</ref>\n\nIn late June 2018, Sony's [[Shawn Layden]] told ''[[Eurogamer]]'' that the company is evaluating their stance on cross-platform play following the ''Fortnite'' issues.

Mobile games are developed with recognition of connection speed limitations of cellular networks, and thus most multiplayer games are often turn-based strategy games rather than real-time action games. Many multiplayer games for mobile devices are asynchronous, where players individually complete turns or actions, these actions sent to central services and pushed out to the other players that may be impacted by those actions.\n\nThere are mobile games that do feature synchronous cross-platform play, typically using centralized services to normalize out platform choices. A common example is ''[[Hearthstone]]'' which enables mobile players to challenge players on any other platform that the game has been released on, including computers.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2015/03/19/hearthstone-iphone-android-cross-play/ | title = Cross-platform play confirmed for Hearthstone on smartphones | first = Stephany | last = Nunneley |  date = March 19, 2015 | accessdate = March 21, 2016 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref> Microsoft introduced server-side Realms in June 2016 to enable ''[[Minecraft]]'' players on Windows, iOS, and Android devices to play together, with Xbox One set to be included in 2017 and eventually support for [[virtual reality]] hardware.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/e3/2016/6/13/11922908/minecraft-cross-platform-e3-2016 | title = Minecraft gets cross-platform play later this year | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = June 13, 2016 | accessdate = June 13, 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> ''Minecraft''{{'}}s \"Bedrock\" edition unifies play across Windows 10, mobile, Xbox One, and [[Nintendo Switch]] versions,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/minecraft-is-unifying-nearly-all-of-its-versions-across-all-platforms-except-sony-439216.phtml | title = Minecraft is unifying nearly all of its versions across all platforms, except Sony | first = Chris | last = Carter | date = June 11, 2017 | accessdate = June 11, 2017 | work  =[[Destructoid]] }}</ref> with PlayStation 4 cross-platform play added in December 2019,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-12-09-finally-playstation-gets-cross-platform-minecraft-tomorrow | title = Finally, PlayStation gets cross-platform Minecraft tomorrow | first=  Tom | last= Phillips | date = December 9, 2019 | accessdate = December 9, 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> while ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' mobile versions were built with cross-platform play with computers and consoles.<ref name=\"verge_fbr\"/><ref name=\"sony_cp_fbr\"/>\n\n===Other hardware===\n[[CCP Games]] have announced they plan to enable cross-platform play for their [[virtual reality]] (VR) title, ''[[Eve: Valkyrie]]'', between the three major VR systems:  the [[Oculus Rift]], the [[HTC Vive]], and [[PlayStation VR]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/21/11477562/eve-valkyrie-cross-platform-play | title = Eve: Valkyrie will support cross-platform play between Rift, Vive and PlayStation VR | first = Ben | last = Kuchera | date = April 21, 2016 | accessdate = April 21, 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of video games that support cross-platform play]]\n*[[Cross-platform software]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Video game terminology]]\n[[Category:Video games with cross-platform play| ]]\n", "name_user": "Longdonwong", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_play"}

This role was fulfilled by trumpeters or buglers and timpanists in the cavalry and the artillery, who did not form into comparative formed bodies in the way that drummers did; therefore, an orthodox corps of drums will exist in the infantry arm and not in other arms (save for the light infantry).\n\n==History==\n\nMost fife and drum traditions trace back to the Swiss mercenaries of the early Renaissance, and it is known that by the early 16th century, each [[Company (military unit)|company]] of infantry soldiers would have a single drummer and a single fife player.<ref>[http://corpsofdrums.com/about/history/ History]</ref> These two musicians would march at the head of the company, and when not providing uplifting marching tunes, they would be used by the company commander to convey orders, on and off the field of battle. The drummers would be more aptly described as signallers than musicians, as shouted orders were very hard to hear over the din of battle. Later, a bugle would become the preferred means of communication on the battlefield, and the drummers adapted, training on bugles and carrying them in battle, but retaining the drum and the title of drummer.\n[[Image:Battle of bunker hill by percy moran.jpg|thumb|Drummers in the centre foreground, in their original battlefield role, close to the officer and wearing the distinctive drummers uniform described below.]]\nAs time went on, the individual drummers and fife players in each company would be organized at battalion level.  They retained their role in each company in battle, but would form one body of men at the head of a battalion on the march. It was necessary to appoint a Drum Major (the equivalent of a Sergeant Major, for the drummers) to be in charge of the drummers and to organize training in the emerging discipline of military drumming while a fife major was to be appointed to be the principal fifer and to train future fife players. The corps of drums would group together when not on duty with each company, and carry out various roles within the battalion, such as administering military justice and ensuring soldier's billets were secured, thus, the corps of drums became attached to the battalion HQ and was organized at battalion level, as opposed to individual company level.\n\n==Current Role==\n\nEventually, as the use of musical instrument on the battlefield diminished, corps of drums looked to fill specialist roles within the battalion while still retaining their original role for ceremonial purposes.\n\nSeveral different strings of logic have seen corps of drums employed in many varied roles. Because the corps would often be employed in support of the battalion, in areas such as delivering mail or designating billets, they are often given the role of assault pioneers, or supporting-fire (machine gun) platoons.\nThe corps of drums role on the battlefield was originally to signal orders, and therefore some units are organised into signals platoons, operating radios.\nCorps of drums were also deployed to march under the parley flag when officers of opposing met to discuss terms of surrender, etc. Therefore, some corps of drums perform a liaison role.\n\nHistorical duties such as uncasing [[Colours, standards and guidons|the colours]] on parade and various other privileges are continued in most units. Due to the specialist duties and ceremonial aspects of a drummers life, a corps of drums may be the unofficial custodian of regimental customs and traditions.\n\nCorps of drums are drawn from the whole battalion, and are attached to the battalion HQ. Above the [[Drum major (military)|drum major]] as its head, the corps is usually answerable to the battalion's [[adjutant]].\n\n==United Kingdom==\n[[File:Drummer Lee Rigby 1.jpg|thumbnail|upright|The late [[Murder of Lee Rigby|Lee Rigby]] was a Drummer in the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]]]\nThe [[British Army]] maintains a corps of drums in each infantry battalion except for [[Royal Regiment of Scotland|Scottish]], [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Irish]], and [[Rifleman|Rifle]] Regiments ([[The Rifles]] and the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]]) which have [[Pipe band|pipes and drums]] and Bugles respectively. Each battalion of a regiment will maintain a corps of drums which may be 'massed' together on certain occasions. All corps-of-drums soldiers are called {{Anchor|drummer}} drummers (shortened to 'Dmr') regardless of the instrument they play, similarly to use of the term \"sapper\" for soldiers of the [[Royal Engineers]].<ref name=\"CoDS-history\"/>\n\nUnlike army musicians who form bands and will usually be limited to auxiliary duties in wartime, drummers in a Corps of Drums are principally fully trained infantry soldiers, with recruitment coming after standard infantry training. A Corps of Drums will deploy with the rest of the battalion, and will often form specialist platoons such as [[assault pioneer]]s, supporting fire or [[force protection]].\n\nHistorically, the drum was used to convey orders during a battle, so the Corps of Drums has always been a fully integrated feature of an infantry battalion. Later on, when the [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]] was adopted to convey orders, drummers were given bugles in addition, but maintained their drums and flutes, except in rifles regiments where the lighter instrument was more conducive to the skirmishing form of warfare.\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Welsh guards drummers on the mall.jpg|thumbnail|Corps of Drums of the Welsh Guards, showing the fleur-de-lys lace on that body and sleeves of the tunic which features more extensively than that of line regiments.]]\nThe main instrument is the [[Snare drum|Side drum]]. These were originally of a rope-tension design with wide wooden hoops, a wooden shell and an animal-skin head. In the British Army, this model has been continuously upgraded, with the inclusion of snares, more modern metal rod-tension and plastic heads. The current British Army 97s-pattern side drum also has nylon hoops.\n\nThe side drum was increasingly decorated throughout the 19th century, until it bore the fully embellished [[regimental colour]]s of the battalion, including its [[battle honour]]s. As such a regiment's drums are often afforded respect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nThe second instrument was originally the [[Fife (instrument)|fife]], replaced in the modern British Army by the [[Five-key flute|five key flute]]. A wide variety of flutes and pitches is used. The fife and later the flute have been favoured as a warlike instrument due to shrill pitch and thus the ability to be heard above the noise of battle. Many tunes such as [[The British Grenadiers]] are traditionally played by military flutes. Fifes and keyed flutes were typically pitched in B-flat, but the flute family eventually expanded to include a Piccolo in E-flat, a perfect fourth higher, and a flute pitched in F, a perfect fourth lower than the B-flat flute. There was also a \"B-flat Bass\" which was pitched an octave below the B-flat flute. Occasionally the B-flat flute is known as the \"Treble\" in order to avoid confusion with the B-flat bass flute. The development of this family of flutes facilitated the development of flute band part music which in many ways imitates the style of larger military bands.\n\nThe bugle replaced the drum mid-way through the 19th century as the most common means of communication on the battlefield. These duties were carried out by the battalion's corps of drums, whose drummers now each carry a bugle.\n\nAs the musical role of a corps of drums became more ceremonial in the 19th and 20th centuries, more instruments were added to make their output more musically complete. A modern corps of drums may thus have a range of percussion instruments such as a [[bass drum]], [[tenor drum]]s and [[cymbals]] in addition to the snare drum, flute and bugle.\n\n===Uniform===\n[[Image:DWR Colours, Erquinghem Lys, France (RLH) 2005-11-12.JPG|thumb|left|A corps of drums of the [[Duke of Wellington's regiment]] (since amalgamated into the [[Yorkshire Regiment]]), showing crown lace tunics, a leopard skin on the bass drummer, and rod-tension side drums with metal hoops.]]\nDrummers originally wore distinct uniforms so as to stand out on the battlefield. During the 18th century most British Army drummers were distinguished by wearing their regimental uniforms in \"reversed colours\" \u2013 thus an infantry regiment wearing [[Red coat (British Army)|red coat]]s with yellow [[facings]] would clothe its drummers in yellow coats with red facings. This practice tended to make drummers targets in battle and after 1812 was replaced by less conspicuous distinctions.<ref>page 71, \"Military Uniforms of Britain & the Empire\", Major R.M. Barnes, Sphere Books 1972</ref> These usually consisted of [[lace]], used liberally all over the standard uniform, in varying patterns. Many early patterns consisted of a \"Christmas-tree\" pattern in which the chest was covered in horizontal lace decreasing in width downwards, and chevrons of lace down each sleeve. The modern infantry pattern in the British Army is of \"crown-and-inch\" lace sewn over the seams down the sleeves, around the collar, and over the seams on the back of the tunic. The crown-and-inch lace itself is about {{convert|1/2|in}} thick with a repeating crown pattern. The [[Guards Division]]s drummers have the old-style \"Christmas-tree\" pattern, with [[fleurs-de-lis]] instead of crowns.\n\nWhilst corps of drums in the British Army often parade in [[Army Combat Uniform|combat uniforms]] and other forms of dress, they will usually parade in the [[full dress|full dress uniform]] as above, being one of a few formations which regularly wear full dress.\n\nIn some regiments, it has become custom for the percussion rank to wear leopard skins over their uniform. This has the dual purpose of protecting the uniform (cymbals have to be muffled against the chest, and therefore would leave vertical marks on a bare tunic) and protecting the instruments themselves (the bass drum can be scratched by uniform buttons). Modern \"leopard skins\" are made from synthetic fur. Other regiments opt for a simple leather or cloth apron.\n\nDrummers have traditionally been armed with \"drummers' swords\", a [[shortsword]] with a simple brass hilt bearing the [[Royal Cypher]]. The practice of wearing swords has been discontinued by some regiments, though many still do carry the swords, whilst some use an [[SA80]] [[bayonet]] as a modern alternative.\n\n===Honourable Artillery Company===\n[[File:HAC Corps of Drums at Wellington Barracks.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[Corps of Drums]] of the Honourable Artillery Company at [[Wellington Barracks]].]]\nThe [[Honourable Artillery Company]] maintains a corps of drums, and as such is the only such sub-unit in an artillery unit in the British Army.<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/units/10738.aspx<HAC Official Website>]</ref> Although the Honourable Artillery Company now fulfils an artillery role, historically it was an infantry regiment, with two battalions fighting during the Great War.<ref>[[Honourable Artillery Company#History<HAC|wiki page, history>]]</ref> The last infantry battalion was disbanded in 1973, but the corps of drums remained. As the regiment still maintains the privilege granted to it by King William IV in 1830, that the H.A.C. should dress as the Grenadier Guards, except wearing silver where the Grenadiers wear gold, the corps of drums of the HAC dresses in a very similar fashion to that of the Grenadier Guards.<ref>[[Honourable Artillery Company#Dress<HAC|wiki page, dress>]]</ref> Just as in other corps of drums of the British Army, its personnel carry out a soldiering role as their main function.\n\nSince the HAC is the oldest unit in existence in the British Army, and as drummers were on the establishment of infantry units at the latest during the 16th century, it may be assumed that the corps of drums of the HAC is the oldest in the British Army, though it has not been in continuous existence.\n\nIn addition, the HAC's veteran unit, the [[Company of Pikemen and Musketeers]] maintains an early form of Corps of Drums known as the 'Musik'. In this capacity, more basic fifes and larger rope-tension drums are used and 17th century uniforms are worn in keeping with the rest of the Company.\n\n===Royal Logistic Corps===\n[[Image:rlc2013-0018.jpg|thumb|RLC Drums with Battle honours.]]\nThe [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (RLC) also maintains a corps of drums in the form of several side drummers, drawn from soldiers who serve a short tour as drummers before returning to a field unit. This is not a conventional corps of drums, as it has no flautists, and comes under the command of regimental headquarters of the RLC, rather than forming a separate entity. It frequently plays with the Band of the RLC, but often performs in isolation. It is famed for its \"black light\" display. These drummers stem from the 12 drummers placed on [[the Royal Waggon Train]] (RWT) in 1803. There are reserve soldiers within the Corps of Drums of 157 Regiment RLC, based at Cardiff in Wales.\n\nAt the time of Waterloo, in the period of deployment to the Low Countries, the RWT introduced drums made of brass. These originated on the Indian sub-continent. The size {{convert|14|by|12|in|mm}}. They weighed {{convert|16|lb}}. They were faced in blue and carried the cypher of King George, with the title below. A few drums of the period survive today. The drumsticks were of Canadian maple, following the campaigns in North America during the Napoleonic era. The drums had drag ropes purchased from unit funds. Whilst drummers carried the bugle, the common instrument for the \"Waggoners\" was the [[fanfare trumpet]] on account of their cavalry traditions, and inclusion in the light cavalry. During that period the corps was then being divided between the foot soldiers, which used drums and fifes, and the mounted soldiers, with cavalry fanfare trumpets as signalling instruments. The drum sling was still that of the hook.\n\n===Royal Marines===\n[[File:USMC-10212009-M-3403K-011.jpg|thumbnail|Royal Marines Corps of Drums]]\n[[Royal Marines Band Service|Royal Marines Bands]] are led by 'buglers', who are trained on both the side drum and the bugle as well as the Herald Fanfare Trumpet (natural trumpet); this section of the band is referred to as \"the Corps of Drums\", which since 1903 is now situated at the front of the band. Whilst similar to Army corps of drums, these are members of the Royal Marines Band Service (RMBS), although they retain their own rank structure.  Members of the RMBS are primarily musicians; however, they also carry out secondary roles (e.g. medics, drivers, force protection etc.) when required to, like their Army counterparts.\n\nRM Buglers have a similar history to Army 'drummers' in that they were used to convey orders on a ship on drums and bugles, and would then mass onshore into corps of drums, though they were still expected to work as individual soldiers,<ref>[http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm Fact Sheet - The Drums of the RM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517130700/http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}</ref> also known in slang by the Royal Navy as drummers.\n\nThese drummer-buglers trace themselves back to the raising of the Royal Marines in 1664 as a maritime foot regiment, with six drummers attached to its battalions.\n\n====History of Maritime Drummers====\nDrums were, in 1664, used for the raising of the [[Royal Marines| Duke of York's and Albany's Maritime Regiment of Foot]], the ''Admiral's Regiment''. The regiment's 1,200 personnel had six snare drummers per company, the ancestors of the corps of drums of the [[Royal Marines Band Service]]. The Holland Regiment soon came after them. They were later to be called ''The Buffs'', the ''Old Buffs'' and ''Howards's Buffs''.\n\nEach time a maritime regiment, or from 1672 onward, a marine regiment, is disbanded and a new one appears in its place, drummers come in, especially the young ones who liked playing drums and wanted to serve playing them. The 1702 formation of the marine and sea-service foot regiments saw the drummers' greatest action at Gibraltar, when they played the drums to support their regiments.\n\nThe [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] saw into action ten British marine regiments and an all-American marine regiment, all units whose drummers and fifers played alongside their units.\n\nEven though part of the [[British Army]] which in the 18th century was led by the War Office, the Board of Ordnance and the Commissariat, marines were naval units. Royal Navy officers were at one point part of the marines. Due to two laws that regulated them and other army and navy units, marine drummers faced a loyalty problem over what drum calls they would have to do, and for what branch and on what occasion they might be required to play drums for orders, commands, etc.\n\nIn 1755, the problem was solved. The Admiralty took over what was then called ''His Majesty's Marine Forces''.  Even though at first Royal Navy officers filled the officer ranks, with lieutenant-colonel being perceived as the highest relevant rank, in 1771 a promotion to colonel occurred for the first time in the H.M.M.F.\n\nAfter their formation, the H.M.M.F's drummers and fifers of the three marine divisions played alongside their fellow soldiers in various landings worldwide on behalf of the Royal Navy. They joined their units in the American War of Independence, and a drummer was at James Cook's service during his sea travels.\n\nAt Adm. John Jervis's insistence, by King George III's order in 1802, the H.M.M.F. was transformed into the ''H.M.M.F.-Royal Marines'', albeit larger than today's establishment. Two years later, bomb vessel crews and gunners became part of the newly created ''Royal Marine Artillery'', in which bugle calls became a regular part of life from then on.\n\nThe Royal Navy in the 19th century was short of manpower in both the H.M.M.F.-R.M. and the R.M.A. For this, Army units joined the H.M.M.F.-R.M. as replacement units, carrying not only their drummers and fifers but also buglers.\n\nIn 1855, during the units' service in the Crimean War, the H.M.M.F.-R.M's foot units became one under the unified title of ''Royal Marines Light Infantry'', later known as the ''Royal Marine Light Infantry''. From then, bugles replaced drums as signallers and order beaters, but the latter would be still useful for drill, being then called ''drummers and buglers'', and from 1867 the R.M.L.I./R.M.A. drummers were called ''buglers'' only, serving individually in ships and the R.N's shore establishments and artillery units and massed into corps of drums for their units on the ground. Fifes fully declined and disappeared in usage. By then, a bugler playing both the drum and his bugle both to sound orders and do drum calls was a common sight in the RMLI and RMA. By the 1890s, even buglers also trained in using herald trumpets or Fanfare trumpets became commonplace in RMLI and RMA bases and facilities.\nA 1902 incident changed the buglers forever. A Coronation Review at [[Aldershot]] was due soon, and the then Sr. Bandmaster of the RMLI, Lt. George Miller, asked his fellow bandmasters to get buglers for his band for the review. The next day at a church parade, he asked 30 RMLI buglers to front the RMLI Massed Bands. They then marched to his own arrangement of Onward Christian Soldiers. Everyone was shocked by this and were amazed that the formation that he used would become a RMLI and RMA military band standard formation setup, and the precision stick drills that he made became a permanent fixture in military events where either or both the RMLI and RMA's presence were needed. Soon later, when the RM began operating the Royal Naval School of Music the next year as a training venue for future bandsmen of the RN, RMLI and RMA, they brought this formation for Royal Navy bands as well, inspiring the formations used by modern military bands of some Commonwealth countries like Australia,  Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\n1923 would see the buglers of the R.M.L.I. and R.M.A. now belong to the ''Corps of Royal Marines'', the Royal Marines of today. Seeing action during the Second World War and in the growing crisis of the [[Cold War]] were the R.M.'s brave buglers of the new '''[[Royal Marines Band Service]]''', even through separate from the bands themselves. The R.M.A. and R.M.L.I. buglers' dress uniforms (dark blue trousers and tunic and red collars and trouser wells) became the full dress of the corps bands and buglers, with the addition of a Wolseley [[pith helmet]] as headdress, and yellow shoulder cords and slashed cuffs to indicate their long history, heritage and lineage from 1664.\n\nBy 1950, the R.N.S.o.M. became today's [[Royal Marines Band Service#Royal Marines School of Music|Royal Marines School of Music]], and the Royal Naval bands were dissolved. Beating retreats by both the Royal Marine bands and the R.M. Corps of Drums buglers would begin to occur annually, later triennially and as of today biannually, at [[Horse Guards Parade]], [[Portsmouth]] and other venues, playing for the entire Royal Navy and the Royal Marines. It would be only in 1978 that the R.M.B.S. would have buglers as well in its rosters. By the 1990s, however, only five R.M. corps of drums were left as the Deal Depot closed down in 1996, the Chatham band already dissolved in the 1940s, with three at the R.N. England bases in [[Portsmouth]], [[Plymouth]] and at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] till 2008 (The last is now assigned to {{HMS|Collingwood|establishment|6}}), one in the R.M.S.o.M. (then in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] and now in Portsmouth since 1996) and another one in [[Scotland]] at HMS ''Caledonia''. By the 1950s, only the band carried the corps at the lead, as separate corps of drums, which played only bugles alongside the drums, were discontinued altogether (these were adopted in the 1880s when the RM began to transition from fifes to bugles).\n\nToday there are six R.M. Bands (plus the training company, R.M.S.o.M. Junior Musicians and Buglers) located around the UK, in Portsmouth (three in HMS Nelson, which includes the R.M.S.o.M.), Fareham (HMS Collingwood), Plymouth (HMS Raleigh), Lympstone (Commando Training Centre Royal Marines) and Scotland (HMS Caledonia) for a total of seven bands and attached corps of drums.  All members of the R.M.B.S. are trained at the Royal Marines School of Music (HMS Nelson). Buglers' training lasts two years. Basic military skills are taught during four months of initial military training and, if successful, trainee buglers are instructed on the bugle, drum and herald/fanfare trumpets. Musical skills are refined and supported with additional lessons in music theory and aural perception. Parade work forms a large part of the curriculum and considerable time is spent developing personal drill and bearing.\n\nToday's R.M. Corps of Drums contains approximately 60 buglers who carry out duties ranging from repatriation services (''Last Post'' and ''Reveille''), mess beatings (drum displays), beating retreat (marching displays) and concerts on behalf of the Royal Marines and the entire Royal Navy.\n\n====Instruments and leadership====\nLike the British Army, Military snare (side) drums (MSD) are the principal instrument of the corps of drums; however, another core instrument is the bugle. Bass drums are often used during parades and drum displays, while cymbals and single tenor drums are used during parades and ceremonies only. Herald Fanfare trumpets (natural trumpets) are also performed on such occasions where a bugle fanfare would be inappropriate for such. The corps is led by a drum major and a bugle major serves as the principal player for it.\n\n===The Drummer's Colour===\n\n[[File:Drummer's colour 2.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Corps of Drums|Drummer]] of the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]] holds the Drummer's Colour.]]\n\nThe Drummer's Colour, also known as the Wilhelmsthal Colour, is a unique [[Military colours, standards and guidons|Colour]] held by 1st Battalion, [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]. A drummer, usually the youngest in the battalion, is detailed to carry it when it is on parade.<ref name=Handbook2019>{{cite web|url=https://thefusiliers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fusiliers-Regimental-Handbook-2019.pdf|title= Regimental Handbook 2019}}</ref>\n\n====History====\nAt the [[battle of Wilhemstahl]] in 1762,The [[5th Foot]] lead the centre column under the command of [[Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick]]. During this action, they captured the Colour of an opposing French regiment, and took a large number of prisoners.<ref name=www.britishempire.co.uk>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/britishinfantry/northumberlandcolour1910.htm|title=www.britishempire.co.uk}}</ref>\nAfter this date, the regiment carried a small green silk banner in addition to their usual stand of Colours to commemorate the one they captured. This was destroyed along with the Regimental Colour by a fire in the [[Mess| Officer's Mess]] in 1833. Despite Representations made to [[King William IV]] refused a request to replace the Drummer's Colour following the fire. However the regiment continued to parade a replacement, and was granted specific permission to do so by [[King George V]] in 1933.<ref name=Handbook2019>{{cite web|url=https://thefusiliers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fusiliers-Regimental-Handbook-2019.pdf|title= Regimental Handbook 2019}}</ref>\n\nSince then, a drummer has been entrusted with carrying the Colour. This is unique within [[infantry]] [[regiments]] of the [[British Army]], since colours are normally only entrusted to [[commissioned officers]], except when they are in the custody of sergeants to convey them to an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Messenger |first1=Charles |title=For Love of Regiment: A History of British Infantry, Volume One, 1660\u20131914 |date=1994 |publisher=Leo Cooper }}</ref> The Drummer's Colour will typically only be paraded on [[St. George's Day]], unlike the other colours of the regiment which are used more frequently. On this day, it is decorated with red and white roses, in keeping with regimental custom which sees all members of the regiment wear the roses in their headdress on this day. The drums of the Corps of Drums and the [[Drum Major|Drum Major's]] staff are also similarly decorated.\n\nWhen the [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers]] were amalgamated with other regiments to form the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]] in 1968, the tradition of carrying the Drummer's Colour was maintained by the 2nd Battalion. When this battalion was in turn 'deleted' in 2014 as a result of the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010]], the Drummer's Colour was passed to the 1st Battalion.\n\n[[File:Drummer's colour.jpg|thumb|A Sergeant Drummer ([[Drum major (military) |Drum Major]]) and Drummer of the [[Northumberland Fusiliers]] with the Drummer's Colour. The staff, Colour, and headdress of both are decorated with red and white roses for [[St. George's Day]].]]\n====Appearance and Charges====\nThe Drummer\u2019s Colour is of gosling green silk edged with gold. [[St. George and the Dragon]] are embroidered in the centre, with red scrolls edged with gold above and below. The motto of the [[Northumberland Fusiliers]] \u2018Quo Fata Vocant\u2019(Go where divine providence leads) is displayed on the upper scroll, and the word \u2018Northumberland\u2019 is on the lower. Above the lower scroll is a large 'V' with 'Regt' below, both in gold, indicating that the Northumberland Fusiliers were the 5th Regiment of Foot at the time of the battle. A laurel wreath with red berries surrounds the central elements, and [[tudor rose]]s surmounted by crowns feature in the four corners.<ref name=handbook>{{cite web|url=http://www.regimentsdirect.co.uk/fusiliers/Content/BRS/Fusiliers%20Regimental%20Handbook.pdf|title=Regimental Handbook|publisher=Regiments Direct|accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===British civilian and cadet corps of drums===\nIn addition to Army and Navy/Royal Marines Corps of Drums, in the [[United Kingdom]] there are also [[Cadet#United Kingdom|cadet]]- civilian corps who base their music on the military traditions of the country.<ref name=\"CoDS-history\"/> The [[Army Cadet Force]] corps use the Army-style formations and instrumentation (flutes/bugles, snare, bass and tenor drums, cymbals and [[Glockenspiel]]s), save for those with Scottish and Irish links that have [[Pipe band]]s instead and those affiliated with the light infantry (especially the now only LI regiment [[The Rifles]]) have a corps of drums without the fifes while using only bugles. Those corps of the [[Combined Cadet Force]], [[Royal Marines Volunteer Cadet Corps]] and the [[Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadet Corps]] use the RN/RM naval and ship-style corps (Snare drums/Bugles, Bass and Tenor drums, cymbals and glockenspiels) and are attached to the main band. This formation is also used by the military band of the [[Duke of York's Royal Military School]]. Another example of a military style CoD is that of the [[Royal British Legion]], whose bands are modeled on the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Band Service. The Royal Air Force however does not have any such ensembles, and only Corps of Drums under the [[Royal Air Force Air Cadets]] are active, with their formation being similar to those of the RN and RM.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police restarted a Corps of Drums in 2011, when the central youth engagement unit purchased some drums and sent cadets on a \"band camp\". Greenwich borough subsequently took a caretaker role of the drums and established a corps of drums. 2015 saw Kensington and Chelsea and Hillingdon Boroughs expanding and creating more branches. It is the first band in the Metropolitan Police to be composed of members of the Metropolitan Police since 1988. It is also the first band in the name of the Metropolitan Police since 1997, when the civilianised Metropolitan Police Band was disbanded.\n\nCivilian corps of drums are also formatted after their respective services, with corps patterned after those of the Army, Navy and the Royal Marines in instrumentation and marching style becoming commonplace. These are staffed by both veteran and retired military drummers as well as civilian drummers playing the fifes, bugles and percussion. In Northern Ireland, civilian corps are mounted by Loyalist groups, which for the most part use flutes with no bugles at all.\n\n==United States==\nA '''corps of drums''' or '''field music band''' in the United States is a type of [[military band]], which originated in European [[Army|armies]] in the 16th century. The main instruments of a corps of drums are the [[drum]] and the [[flute]] or [[Fife (instrument)|fife]] and [[bugle]]. Unlike 'full' [[Military band|military marching bands]], corps of drums usually exist within an [[infantry]] [[battalion]]. A [[Drum major (military)|drum major]] is the leader of a corps of drums, and in the past a fife major served as the principal fifer or flautist with a bugle major serving the same purpose for the buglers.\n\n[[Valley Forge Military Academy and College]] has a corps of drums that is part of the regimental band. Uniforms and music are modelled on the Royal Marines Corps of Drums. VFMAC does have a similar but separate formation which is part of the Corps of Cadets (VFMAC Field Music) which only uses drums (snares, tenors and basses), cymbals and bugles and from 2011, fifes. Formed in 1956, it also provides the official guard-of-honour for visitors to the Delaware Valley area.\n\nThe [[United States Army]] [[Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps]], raised in 1960 and part of the [[3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)]] of the [[United States Army]], formally revived this very part of American military music history and its mission is to relive it for coming generations. This is the only musical unit of the US armed forces in which its drum major, wearing a classic 18th century infantry cap and carrying a [[spontoon]], the honor badge and weapon of 18th century senior non-commissioned officers, salutes using the left hand. Musicians assigned to this unit wear 18th century military uniforms reminiscent of those used in the [[American Revolutionary War]] by the [[Continental Army]] drummers and fifers. Another corps of drums is found as part of the [[West Point Band]] - the West Point Hellcats, which wear regulation uniforms from the 1820s, and since 2016 play using bugles, fifes and traditional rope tension snare and bass drums.  Until the late 19th century the US Army and the [[United States Marine Corps]] maintained similar ensembles before switching to bugles.\n\n=== Formation of field music/corps of drums in the US Armed Forces and civilian organizations === \nWhile only the Old Guard FDC is the only field music formation in the US Armed Forces and thus more similar to a European corps of drums, in the past there had been similar formations armed forces-wide. Should such units be reactivated again not just in the Armed Forces but also as civilian, veterans or youth cadet formations, the formation of the ensemble is as follows (the formation is to be expected to be led by a drum major):\n\n* Field snare drums\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Cymbals (optional)\n* Single tenor drums (optional)\n* Glockenspiels (optional)\n* Fifes\n* Piccolos, Flutes\n* Bugles in B and/or G Major\n* Chromatic fanfare Trumpets in B or G Major (optional)\n* Single-valve bugles (Only in the Old Guard FDC)\n* Soprano and Baritone Herald Fanfare Bugles (optional)\n* Soprano and Baritone Herald fanfare trumpets (optional)\n* Soprano Bugles\n* Alto bugles\n* Flugelhorn Bugles\n* Mellophones\n* Baritone Bugles\n* Marching Baritones\n* Contrabass bugles\n\n==Germany==\nIn Germany, ''Spielmannszug'', ''Tambourkorps'' and  sometimes ''Trommlerkorps'' are the names given to the German corps of drums, whether it is a military formation or a civilian formation. The instrumentation of these are, commonly fifes and snare drums (just like the [[Bundeswehr]] corps of drums that are attached to the unit military bands), [[flute]]s and [[piccolo]]s, [[Glockenspiel]]s, Bass drums, cymbals and, on some corps, single and multiple tenor drums, and like their British counterparts, bugles (in several corps). [[Timpani]], [[vibraphone]]s and [[marimba]]s are used in concerts. Sometimes even a [[Turkish crescent]] is used to symbolize the band. Whatever the configuration, a drum major always leads the corps during military and civil parades and other events, and in modern corps even majorettes and pom pom dancers are a part of its roster.\n\nMilitary corps of drums belong and are attached to the bands of the Bundeswehr [[Military bands of the Bundeswehr|Military Music Center]] under the Bundeswehr [[Streitkr\u00e4ftebasis]] while civilian corps are dedicated civil bands and youth bands assigned in cities and towns all over Germany.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1990, the [[National People's Army]] maintained corps of drums in the same manner as the Bundeswehr. During the Republic Day parades on 7 October in East Berlin from 1959 to 1989, the national corps included single tenor drums at the front.\n\n==Russia/CIS==\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e \u0414\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0417\u0412\u041e (5).jpg|thumb|Drummers of the [[Minsk Suvorov Military School]] on the avenue during a parade in 2017.]]\nRussian '''{{transl|ru|Barabanshchiki}}''' or drummers are names that are used to refer to Russian military corps of drums ({{lang|ru|\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432}}, {{transl|ru|rota barabanshchikom}}), a practice that is of Imperial origin in the field drummers that marched at the lead of their units in parades and that is a part of the traditions of almost all former Soviet republics (save for the Baltics and Georgia). Russian drum corps are usually made up of snare drummers with one line of [[flute]] or [[fife]] players in the middle and two [[glockenspiel]]s in the front (with the option for a third one or a [[Turkish crescent]], plus chromatic fanfare trumpeters, buglers and trumpeters). Military corps of drums are usually made separate from the massed military bands of the unit or command that it is a part of, and are led by a drum major who is a commissioned officer of minimum junior officer rank.\n\n[[File:Azerbaijan Armed Forces.jpg|thumb|An Azerbaijani corps of drums]]\n\nHistorically, the corps of drums is a military unit that is formally a part of the junior military high schools of these countries. Uniquely, the [[Azerbaijani Armed Forces]] follows the Turkish models by attaching a full bugle formation behind the corps of drums.\n\n===List of Post-Soviet units/institutions with corps of drums===\n*[[Moscow Military Music College]]\n*Kronstadt Sea Cadet Corps \n*Ussuriysk Suvorov Military School\n*Yekaterinburg Suvorov Military School\n*Vladivostok Nakhimov Naval School\n*Baltic Fleet Naval Training Center Sevastopol\n*[[Minsk Suvorov Military School]]\n*[[Ivan Bohun Military High School]]\n*[[Monte Melkonian Military College]]\n*[[Azerbaijan Higher Military Academy]]\n*[[Astana Zhas Ulan Republican School]]\n*[[Mastibek Tashmukhamedov Military Lyceum of the Ministry of Defense of Tajikistan]]\n*[[Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense of Turkmenistan]]\n*[[Military Music College of Mongolia]]\n*Georgi Atanasov Military Music School (until 2001<ref>https://m.dnevnik.bg/print/arhiv_pari/2001/08/01/1544686_zakrivat_uchilishte_zaradi_lipsa_na_pari/amp</ref>)\n\n== Sweden ==\nOnly the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]] King's Guard Battalion has a corps of drums organized as a platoon - the [[Svea Corps of Drums]] (''F\u00e4ltpipark\u00e5ren/Livgardets trumk\u00e5r'') which is part of the Life Guards Company. Until 2009 the Royal Swedish Army Drum Corps served as the official active field music unit of both the Army and the entire Armed Forces, and thus only the [[Home Guard (Sweden)|Home Guard Command]] maintains the practice with dedicated ensembles in several areas of the country.\n\n== Canada ==\nThe sole corps of drums that is active within the [[Canadian Army]] today is the Corps of Drums of [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]]. Being a musical unit, it replaces the regimental band of the PPCLI, which was dissolved in 1994. Based on the British tradition for these units, it is modeled on the Corps of Drums of the [[Royal Logistics Corps]] of the [[British Army]]. The regimental drum corps is divided into three units which are assigned to different battalions in the PPCLI. These individual drum corps operate as small drum lines that serve during different ceremonies and events. Unlike their British and American counterparts, but more similar to the Corps of Drums of the RLC, the drum corps does not utilize [[flutes]] and bugles. An example of a historical corps of drums can be found through the [[Fort Henry Guard]] and the [[Fort York Guard]], both of which sport corps of drums that include [[fife]]s and are led by a Drum Major and a Drum Sergeant. Although it is not part of the Canadian Forces, it is designed to represent the units of the [[British Army]] in [[Upper Canada]]. During WWII, many regiments maintained small corps of drums that were stationed at all\nmajor bases. While most of them were staffed by active duty troops, others were staffed by volunteer bandsmen, consisting of reservists and professional civilian percussionists.<ref>http://www.dcxmuseum.org/assets/15%2520-%2520Canadian%2520Military%2520erum%2520and%2520Bugle%2520Corps.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjJw9qw5tPmAhUFXM0KHdBUBu4QFjARegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw2p9l-GZYX4FDm3EkT4dJFS</ref>\n\nIn the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], corps of drums have been historically attached to military bands at the front-rank following the precedent the [[Royal Marines Band Service|bands]] of the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Corps of Royal Marines]]. After the 1968 [[Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces]], corps of drums in both the RCN, were dismantled and abolished, although notably making a return in the mid-1980s within the naval reserve. In July 2013, a five-person corps of drums was unveiled for the first time by the [[Naden Band of Maritime Forces Pacific]] a [[Victoria Day]] Parade.<ref>http://www.lookoutnewspaper.com/corps-of-drums-return-to-band/</ref>\n\n==Netherlands and in Indonesia==\n''Drum bands'' are the Dutch and Indonesian terms for the corps of drums, but in the [[Netherlands]] they are also called as ''drumfanfares'', ''tamboerkorps'', ''trompetterkorps'' and ''klaroenkorps'' (''drum and lyre bands, [[fanfare band]]s and drum and brass bands'') and in [[Indonesia]] as ''marching bands'' and ''drum corps''.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the basic instrumentation is\n\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Multiple and single tenor drums\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* Flutes, Fifes\n* Bugles, Natural trumpets, [[fanfare trumpet]]s\n* Natural horns (few bands only)\n* Turkish crescent (optional)\n* [[Brass section]]/[[Marching brass]] (in few bands)\n\nMilitary drum bands in the [[armed forces of the Netherlands]] would have only two to four of these basic instruments.\n\nOptional or permanent instruments in these bands are flutes and piccolos, bugles, natural horns, valved bugles and brass instruments (soprano bugles and trumpets, cornets, horns, mellophones, baritones, sousaphones and contrabass bugles).\n\nThese bands are attached to the main marching band, similar to French bands, but also perform as stand alone bands. They are led by a drum major, and can have [[majorette (dancer)|majorette]]s and [[colour guard]]s, the latter now more separated from the band.\n\nIn the 1990s however these bands became paramilitary-styled and even adopted the traditions of British military bands of the Guards Division and the Royal Marines, but several of these bands chose the American marching band and drum and bugle corps practice. Some of these bands also adopted woodwind instruments turning them into full-time military marching bands, and almost all drum bands use English voice commands and not Dutch commands and only a few use whistle commands and the mace movements.\n\nIn Indonesia, the corps, a military musical heritage from Dutch colonial times, may be treated as military, civil or school marching and show bands, and in some cases as [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|drum and bugle corps]], and are either attached to the main marching band or as stand-alone bands, with instrumentation drawn from the following:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Single tenor drums\n* Multiple tenor drums\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* [[Melodica]]s (in school marching bands)\n* [[Fanfare trumpet]]s (chromatic and/or herald) (optional)\n* [[Bugle]]s (optional)\n* Flutes, piccolos (in the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]])\n* Fifes (optional in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[Clarinet]]s (in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[Trumpet]]s, [[cornet]]s and soprano bugles\n* Alto bugles\n* [[Flugelhorn]]s and flugel bugles\n* [[Trombone]]s (optional in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[French horn|Horn]]s, [[mellophone]]s and horn bugles\n* Baritone bugles, [[baritone horn]]s and marching baritones\n* [[Wagner tuba]]s (optional)\n* [[Tuba]]s, [[euphonium]]s, [[saxhorn]]s (optional)\n* [[Contrabass bugle]]s, [[sousaphone]]s\n''If a civilian front ensemble is present'':\n* [[Marimba]]\n* [[Vibraphone]]\n* Xylophone\n* Suspended cymbals\n* Tubular bells\n* Gong\n* Drum kit\n* Timpani\n\nThey are led by from one to six [[Drum major (military)|drum major]]s and can have a separate director of music (in civil and police bands only), majorettes and [[color guard (flag spinning)|Colour guard]]s (optional). The drum majors in these bands have a unique use of the mace in order to coordinate the timing and precision of the band like US marching band drum majors do. The Indonesian corps also has dancing bass drummers either wearing uniforms or costumes (such is the case in the corps of drums of the various Indonesian uniformed organizations, most especially the armed forces and the national police), a unique feature of these corps and are attached to it and are also a nod to Indonesian cultural traditions, plus dancing contrabass buglers and baritone buglers in some bands. The brass instruments are pitched in C, F or B major unlike US military DBCs, most notably that of the [[United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps]] that use G major brasses and civilian corps in the past, and so too are the glockenspiels being used and the flutes and clarinets.\n\nAnother unique characteristic is that in military and police corps of drums, tenor and bass drummers, baritone buglers (optionally) and contrabass buglers wear combat, duty or everyday uniform (and optionally costumes for the tenor drummers) instead of the full dress uniform while playing, whether in performance, field practice or rehearsals, unlike their British counterparts do. They wear [[beret]]s, [[ball cap]]s or [[side cap]]s as head-dress, unlike the rest of the band, who wear [[peaked cap]]s, especially the drum majors and in civil bands, the director of music, the color guards and the pit section during field performances. Bands of the Armed Forces academies tend to have their single tenor drummers wear their specialty uniform and colored berets of the selected service arm or branch, with those of the Navy wearing free diving gear and the Air Force flightsuits.\n\n=== Ancient style corps of drums in Indonesia ===\n\nThe practice was introduced to the Netherlands East Indies in the early 1800s, and today both the [[Yogyakarta Kraton Guards]] and the Royal Guard of [[Pakualaman]] each sport an ancient form of the corps, alongside a recently reconstituted formation from the Royal Guard of the [[Surakarta Sunanate]]. Alongside them, both the southern regencies of Central Java and Yogyakarta have dedicated civilian corps, each serving the ''bregodo rakyat'' (''people's brigade'') companies that conserve the traditions of the armed services of the former sultanates. These corps, when formed up in parade, are composed of:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Fifes, flutes, [[suling]] flutes\n* Bugle/s\n* Trumpet/s (in some civil bands)\n* One to three [[Kendang]]s\n* Single tenor drum/s (in civil bands)\n* Cymbals\n* Bass drum (in civil bands and in Surakarta)\n* Gong/s\n\n==South America==\nInspired by the German (and sometimes French) style corps of drums, South American corps differ in instrumentation, size and leadership.\n\n===Chile===\nSimilar to the German corps, the Chilean corps of drums are both military and civil bands, the ''Bandas de Guerra'' (War Bands) that the Chileans call them formally.\n\nMilitary corps of drums belong to the Chilean Armed Forces' three services, the [[Carabineros de Chile]] and the [[Chilean Gendarmerie]] and differ in instrumentation and officers in charge (only in the Chilean Navy).\n\n*[[Chilean Army]]: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*[[Chilean Navy]]: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major)\n*[[Chilean Air Force]]: Snare drums, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*Chilean Carabiners: Snare drums, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*Chilean Gendarmerie: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n\nThe military style corps also inherit the British corps' tradition of carrying drummers' swords attached to belts in all their dress uniforms.\n\nCivilian corps are usually school based bands with the addition of a percussion section (Snare drums, bass drums and cymbals) and glockenspiels and are either part of a school marching band or as a standalone band in itself. In these separate bands, a fife major leads the band's fifers/flautists while on duty, and also assist the drum major and the bugle major. These positions also exists on corps which are now part of school bands, as well as in a few volunteer community fire departments. These civil corps perform on occasions when requested and participate in competitions.\n\n===Ecuador===\nCorps of drums in Ecuador are both military and civil bands. These corps are very similar to the German corps, but with the addition of bugles and the single tenor drum.\n\nLike the Chilean corps, these bands have differences in configuration and instrumentation in the Ecuadorian armed forces. But the corps snare and tenor (sometimes bass) drummers often play on drums that are painted in the service or unit colours (sometimes in the colours of Guayaquil, which are blue and white for the corps of the [[Ecuadorian Navy]]) and in the case of the Military Academy \"Eloy Alfaro\" and the Air Force Academy \"Cosme Rendella\", have the unit/school insignia attached to the bugles' and fifes' tabards.\n\nThe typical Ecuadorian corps, called as the ''Peloton Comando'' (Commando Platoon) but are also called as the ''Banda de Guerra'' (War Band), just like in Chile in several schools and colleges (many bands now fall under the ''Banda Escolar'' or ''Banda de Paz'' title due to recent state reforms), is led by a drum major (in several cases there would be 1 to 4 drum majors) and is composed of:\n\n*Snare drums\n*Fifes (common only in the Ecuadorian Army and Ecuadorian Air Force and school bands)\n*Bugles and natural trumpets (common in all three services, principal instrument in the Ecuadorian Navy)\n*Single tenor drums\n*Bass drums (optional and common in some corps)\n*Cymbals (optional and in some corps)\n*Glockenspiels\n*Multiple tenor drums (only in school bands)\n\nEcuadorian Civil corps of drums are similar only to the Army and Air Force corps but are based as youth bands stationed in schools across the nation. Notable exceptions include the Corps of Drums of the Ecuadorian National Police. Like military corps, they are led by a drum major in all their activities but there are cases of multiple drum majors leading, from a minimum of two to a maximum of four or five. But in some corps, there are some majorettes and tambourine players. Those that are based on the Navy's corps of drums (especially [[Guayaquil]]-based corps) use the same instrumentation as its corps have.\n\n===Venezuela===\nSimilar to Germany and Colombia's, the Venezuelan corps of drums are both military and civil bands, and like Colombia's, Peru's and Ecuador's contain the same instrumentation of :\n\n*Snare drums\n*Bass drums\n*Cymbals\n*Single tenor drums\n*Glockenspiels\n*Bugles (and optionally trumpets)\n\nThe corps is led by a single drum major. In some corps, especially in civil-based ones, other brass instruments may be added into the bugle section.\n\nMilitary corps have tabards applied on the bass drums, snare drums, glockenspiels and bugles on every occasion that it is performing. One such formation is the Military Academy of Venezuela Corps of Drums. Recently there's an effort to build up full-time military marching bands in the national armed forces with the percussion of the corps combined with brass and woodwind instruments.\n\n===Bolivia===\nCorps of drums in Bolivia, both military and civil, are inspired by German and French band practices and are part of the main band. The instruments used by them are snare drums, tenor drums (single and multiple), bass drums, cymbals and sometime glockenspiels. Turkish crescents are used as standards and are paraded as part of them. In military corps attached to bands there would be one to two drum majors and in some cases standards or vertical banners are used to distinguish the corps when on parade. Civil corps attached to [[marching band]]s would have one to eight drum majors (in some cases ten) and would also have a military-styled colour guard marching with the Turkish crescents and optionally the standards.\n\n===Peru===\nPeruvian corps of drums are both military (''Banda de guerra'') and civil bands (''Banda ritmica''), with differences in instrumentation. In whatever combination, it's a main part of the main school or military marching band led by the Director of Music, with the drum major or majorette or standard bearer leading led by the conductor or as a separate band led by the drum major or standard bearer at the front of the ensemble. These follow the Spanish and French influence.\n\nCorps of drums in the [[Peruvian Armed Forces]] and the [[National Police of Peru]] (formerly the Civil Guard of Peru, Peruvian Investigations Police and Peruvian Republican Guard), plus school or college based bands and corps attached to them or as separate bands are composed of snare and or field drums, single tenor drums, multiple tenor drum (in school corps), bugles and glockenspiels in addition to the regular snare and bass drums and cymbals. [[Tambourine]]s are common within the school-based corps, with female [[majorette (dancer)|majorette]]s assisting the conductor or the school band drum major or music director. Tabards are applied only on the bugles and glockenspiels, as well as in the snare and tenor drums if applicable.\n\n===Colombia===\nColombian corps of drums ar similar to those of Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Venezuela but are different in leadership, being led by a minimum of 3-7 drum majors or majorettes, and are composed instrumentally of:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Field/precision snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Single tenor drums\n* Multiple tenor drums (civil corps)\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* Bugles and trumpets\n* Natural trumpets (military corps only and in several civil corps)\n* [[Trombones]] (optional, only in select military corps)\n* [[Saxhorns]] (only in select military corps)\n* [[Bagpipes]] (in the corps of drums of the [[Colombian Naval Academy]] and the Basic School of the [[Colombian Naval Infantry]])\n* Tambourines (civil corps)\n* Conga drums (civil Corps)\n* Timbales (civil corps)\n* Cowbells (civil corps)\n* Suspended cymbals (civil corps)\n\nCivil corps would also have a separate conductor, occasionally standard bearers and [[colour guard]]s marching along.\n\nEven through separate from the main marching band, a part of the band itself or as a band of its own, they are both useful as military-based and civil-based marching bands. The drums are either covered with cloth tabards of the unit or band to which the corps belongs, or painted in various colours to suit its needs.  The bugles, trumpets and glockenspiels (and in military units and several civil bands, natural trumpets) are attached with small tabards with the military service, police, school or college insignia, name or emblem shown in them.\n\n== Central America ==\nKnown as ''Bandas de Guerra'' or ''banda tradicional'' in Spanish, the Corps of drums tradition is also active in the following Central American countries:\n\n* [[Guatemala]]\n* [[El Salvador]]\n* [[Honduras]]\n* [[Panama]]\n\nThe Guatemalan corps tradition is mostly active in school-based corps, which mirror drum and bugle corps of the US and Mexico. In Nicaragua, only the Nicaraguan Armed Forces sports a small corps manned by officer cadets. School based bands are known as ''bandas ritmicas'' following the Peruvian pattern and are percussion only.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200141/http://www.coldstreamguards.org.nz/ Coldstream Guards Corps of Drums website]\n*[http://www.royalwelshband.com/drums/drums.shtml Regimental Band of The Royal Welsh Guards Corps of Drums website]\n*[http://www.corpsofdrums.com/ Corps of Drums Society]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080325110007/http://www.army.mod.uk/rlc_band/corps_of_drums.htm Corps of Drums of The Royal Logistic Corps]\n*[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XgwuPK4jEA0 Kirab Drum Corps Akpol]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Military band]]\n* [[Marching band]]\n* [[Pipe band]]\n* [[Fife and drum corps]] for the US variant \n* [[Fanfare trumpet]]\n* [[Fanfare band]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corps Of Drums}}\n[[Category:Types of musical groups]]\n[[Category:Marching bands]]\n[[Category:Military bands]]\n[[Category:Combat occupations]]\n", "text_old": "{{see also|Drum and bugle corps (disambiguation){{!}}Drum and bugle corps}}\n\n[[File:2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade-24.jpeg|thumb|right|Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Conservatoire at the Victory Parade on Red Square, 2010.

Drummers were originally established in European armies to act as signallers.<ref name=\"CoDS-history\">{{cite web\n  | title = History of the Corps Of Drums Where did it all start?\n  | publisher = The Corps of Drums Society\n  | url = http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm\n  | accessdate = 2008-06-11\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517130700/http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm\n  | archivedate = 17 May 2008\n  | df = dmy-all\n  }}</ref> This is the major historical distinction between a military band and a corps of drums, 'drummers' would not play their instruments to entertain or delight, but rather as a utilitarian battlefield role. This role was fulfilled by trumpeters or buglers and timpanists in the cavalry and the artillery, who did not form into comparative formed bodies in the way that drummers did; therefore, an orthodox corps of drums will exist in the infantry arm and not in other arms (save for the light infantry).\n\n==History==\n\nMost fife and drum traditions trace back to the Swiss mercenaries of the early Renaissance, and it is known that by the early 16th century, each [[Company (military unit)|company]] of infantry soldiers would have a single drummer and a single fife player.<ref>[http://corpsofdrums.com/about/history/ History]</ref> These two musicians would march at the head of the company, and when not providing uplifting marching tunes, they would be used by the company commander to convey orders, on and off the field of battle. The drummers would be more aptly described as signallers than musicians, as shouted orders were very hard to hear over the din of battle. Later, a bugle would become the preferred means of communication on the battlefield, and the drummers adapted, training on bugles and carrying them in battle, but retaining the drum and the title of drummer.\n[[Image:Battle of bunker hill by percy moran.jpg|thumb|Drummers in the centre foreground, in their original battlefield role, close to the officer and wearing the distinctive drummers uniform described below.]]\nAs time went on, the individual drummers and fife players in each company would be organized at battalion level.  They retained their role in each company in battle, but would form one body of men at the head of a battalion on the march. It was necessary to appoint a Drum Major (the equivalent of a Sergeant Major, for the drummers) to be in charge of the drummers and to organize training in the emerging discipline of military drumming while a fife major was to be appointed to be the principal fifer and to train future fife players. The corps of drums would group together when not on duty with each company, and carry out various roles within the battalion, such as administering military justice and ensuring soldier's billets were secured, thus, the corps of drums became attached to the battalion HQ and was organized at battalion level, as opposed to individual company level.\n\n==Current Role==\n\nEventually, as the use of musical instrument on the battlefield diminished, corps of drums looked to fill specialist roles within the battalion while still retaining their original role for ceremonial purposes.\n\nSeveral different strings of logic have seen corps of drums employed in many varied roles. Because the corps would often be employed in support of the battalion, in areas such as delivering mail or designating billets, they are often given the role of assault pioneers, or supporting-fire (machine gun) platoons.\nThe corps of drums role on the battlefield was originally to signal orders, and therefore some units are organised into signals platoons, operating radios.\nCorps of drums were also deployed to march under the parley flag when officers of opposing met to discuss terms of surrender, etc. Therefore, some corps of drums perform a liaison role.\n\nHistorical duties such as uncasing [[Colours, standards and guidons|the colours]] on parade and various other privileges are continued in most units. Due to the specialist duties and ceremonial aspects of a drummers life, a corps of drums may be the unofficial custodian of regimental customs and traditions.\n\nCorps of drums are drawn from the whole battalion, and are attached to the battalion HQ. Above the [[Drum major (military)|drum major]] as its head, the corps is usually answerable to the battalion's [[adjutant]].\n\n==United Kingdom==\n[[File:Drummer Lee Rigby 1.jpg|thumbnail|upright|The late [[Murder of Lee Rigby|Lee Rigby]] was a Drummer in the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]]]\nThe [[British Army]] maintains a corps of drums in each infantry battalion except for [[Royal Regiment of Scotland|Scottish]], [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Irish]], and [[Rifleman|Rifle]] Regiments ([[The Rifles]] and the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]]) which have [[Pipe band|pipes and drums]] and Bugles respectively. Each battalion of a regiment will maintain a corps of drums which may be 'massed' together on certain occasions. All corps-of-drums soldiers are called {{Anchor|drummer}} drummers (shortened to 'Dmr') regardless of the instrument they play, similarly to use of the term \"sapper\" for soldiers of the [[Royal Engineers]].<ref name=\"CoDS-history\"/>\n\nUnlike army musicians who form bands and will usually be limited to auxiliary duties in wartime, drummers in a Corps of Drums are principally fully trained infantry soldiers, with recruitment coming after standard infantry training. A Corps of Drums will deploy with the rest of the battalion, and will often form specialist platoons such as [[assault pioneer]]s, supporting fire or [[force protection]].\n\nHistorically, the drum was used to convey orders during a battle, so the Corps of Drums has always been a fully integrated feature of an infantry battalion. Later on, when the [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]] was adopted to convey orders, drummers were given bugles in addition, but maintained their drums and flutes, except in rifles regiments where the lighter instrument was more conducive to the skirmishing form of warfare.\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Welsh guards drummers on the mall.jpg|thumbnail|Corps of Drums of the Welsh Guards, showing the fleur-de-lys lace on that body and sleeves of the tunic which features more extensively than that of line regiments.]]\nThe main instrument is the [[Snare drum|Side drum]]. These were originally of a rope-tension design with wide wooden hoops, a wooden shell and an animal-skin head. In the British Army, this model has been continuously upgraded, with the inclusion of snares, more modern metal rod-tension and plastic heads. The current British Army 97s-pattern side drum also has nylon hoops.\n\nThe side drum was increasingly decorated throughout the 19th century, until it bore the fully embellished [[regimental colour]]s of the battalion, including its [[battle honour]]s. As such a regiment's drums are often afforded respect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nThe second instrument was originally the [[Fife (instrument)|fife]], replaced in the modern British Army by the [[Five-key flute|five key flute]]. A wide variety of flutes and pitches is used. The fife and later the flute have been favoured as a warlike instrument due to shrill pitch and thus the ability to be heard above the noise of battle. Many tunes such as [[The British Grenadiers]] are traditionally played by military flutes. Fifes and keyed flutes were typically pitched in B-flat, but the flute family eventually expanded to include a Piccolo in E-flat, a perfect fourth higher, and a flute pitched in F, a perfect fourth lower than the B-flat flute. There was also a \"B-flat Bass\" which was pitched an octave below the B-flat flute. Occasionally the B-flat flute is known as the \"Treble\" in order to avoid confusion with the B-flat bass flute. The development of this family of flutes facilitated the development of flute band part music which in many ways imitates the style of larger military bands.\n\nThe bugle replaced the drum mid-way through the 19th century as the most common means of communication on the battlefield. These duties were carried out by the battalion's corps of drums, whose drummers now each carry a bugle.\n\nAs the musical role of a corps of drums became more ceremonial in the 19th and 20th centuries, more instruments were added to make their output more musically complete. A modern corps of drums may thus have a range of percussion instruments such as a [[bass drum]], [[tenor drum]]s and [[cymbals]] in addition to the snare drum, flute and bugle.\n\n===Uniform===\n[[Image:DWR Colours, Erquinghem Lys, France (RLH) 2005-11-12.JPG|thumb|left|A corps of drums of the [[Duke of Wellington's regiment]] (since amalgamated into the [[Yorkshire Regiment]]), showing crown lace tunics, a leopard skin on the bass drummer, and rod-tension side drums with metal hoops.]]\nDrummers originally wore distinct uniforms so as to stand out on the battlefield. During the 18th century most British Army drummers were distinguished by wearing their regimental uniforms in \"reversed colours\" \u2013 thus an infantry regiment wearing [[Red coat (British Army)|red coat]]s with yellow [[facings]] would clothe its drummers in yellow coats with red facings. This practice tended to make drummers targets in battle and after 1812 was replaced by less conspicuous distinctions.<ref>page 71, \"Military Uniforms of Britain & the Empire\", Major R.M. Barnes, Sphere Books 1972</ref> These usually consisted of [[lace]], used liberally all over the standard uniform, in varying patterns. Many early patterns consisted of a \"Christmas-tree\" pattern in which the chest was covered in horizontal lace decreasing in width downwards, and chevrons of lace down each sleeve. The modern infantry pattern in the British Army is of \"crown-and-inch\" lace sewn over the seams down the sleeves, around the collar, and over the seams on the back of the tunic. The crown-and-inch lace itself is about {{convert|1/2|in}} thick with a repeating crown pattern. The [[Guards Division]]s drummers have the old-style \"Christmas-tree\" pattern, with [[fleurs-de-lis]] instead of crowns.\n\nWhilst corps of drums in the British Army often parade in [[Army Combat Uniform|combat uniforms]] and other forms of dress, they will usually parade in the [[full dress|full dress uniform]] as above, being one of a few formations which regularly wear full dress.\n\nIn some regiments, it has become custom for the percussion rank to wear leopard skins over their uniform. This has the dual purpose of protecting the uniform (cymbals have to be muffled against the chest, and therefore would leave vertical marks on a bare tunic) and protecting the instruments themselves (the bass drum can be scratched by uniform buttons). Modern \"leopard skins\" are made from synthetic fur. Other regiments opt for a simple leather or cloth apron.\n\nDrummers have traditionally been armed with \"drummers' swords\", a [[shortsword]] with a simple brass hilt bearing the [[Royal Cypher]]. The practice of wearing swords has been discontinued by some regiments, though many still do carry the swords, whilst some use an [[SA80]] [[bayonet]] as a modern alternative.\n\n===Honourable Artillery Company===\n[[File:HAC Corps of Drums at Wellington Barracks.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[Corps of Drums]] of the Honourable Artillery Company at [[Wellington Barracks]].]]\nThe [[Honourable Artillery Company]] maintains a corps of drums, and as such is the only such sub-unit in an artillery unit in the British Army.<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/units/10738.aspx<HAC Official Website>]</ref> Although the Honourable Artillery Company now fulfils an artillery role, historically it was an infantry regiment, with two battalions fighting during the Great War.<ref>[[Honourable Artillery Company#History<HAC|wiki page, history>]]</ref> The last infantry battalion was disbanded in 1973, but the corps of drums remained. As the regiment still maintains the privilege granted to it by King William IV in 1830, that the H.A.C. should dress as the Grenadier Guards, except wearing silver where the Grenadiers wear gold, the corps of drums of the HAC dresses in a very similar fashion to that of the Grenadier Guards.<ref>[[Honourable Artillery Company#Dress<HAC|wiki page, dress>]]</ref> Just as in other corps of drums of the British Army, its personnel carry out a soldiering role as their main function.\n\nSince the HAC is the oldest unit in existence in the British Army, and as drummers were on the establishment of infantry units at the latest during the 16th century, it may be assumed that the corps of drums of the HAC is the oldest in the British Army, though it has not been in continuous existence.\n\nIn addition, the HAC's veteran unit, the [[Company of Pikemen and Musketeers]] maintains an early form of Corps of Drums known as the 'Musik'. In this capacity, more basic fifes and larger rope-tension drums are used and 17th century uniforms are worn in keeping with the rest of the Company.\n\n===Royal Logistic Corps===\n[[Image:rlc2013-0018.jpg|thumb|RLC Drums with Battle honours.]]\nThe [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (RLC) also maintains a corps of drums in the form of several side drummers, drawn from soldiers who serve a short tour as drummers before returning to a field unit. This is not a conventional corps of drums, as it has no flautists, and comes under the command of regimental headquarters of the RLC, rather than forming a separate entity. It frequently plays with the Band of the RLC, but often performs in isolation. It is famed for its \"black light\" display. These drummers stem from the 12 drummers placed on [[the Royal Waggon Train]] (RWT) in 1803. There are reserve soldiers within the Corps of Drums of 157 Regiment RLC, based at Cardiff in Wales.\n\nAt the time of Waterloo, in the period of deployment to the Low Countries, the RWT introduced drums made of brass. These originated on the Indian sub-continent. The size {{convert|14|by|12|in|mm}}. They weighed {{convert|16|lb}}. They were faced in blue and carried the cypher of King George, with the title below. A few drums of the period survive today. The drumsticks were of Canadian maple, following the campaigns in North America during the Napoleonic era. The drums had drag ropes purchased from unit funds. Whilst drummers carried the bugle, the common instrument for the \"Waggoners\" was the [[fanfare trumpet]] on account of their cavalry traditions, and inclusion in the light cavalry. During that period the corps was then being divided between the foot soldiers, which used drums and fifes, and the mounted soldiers, with cavalry fanfare trumpets as signalling instruments. The drum sling was still that of the hook.\n\n===Royal Marines===\n[[File:USMC-10212009-M-3403K-011.jpg|thumbnail|Royal Marines Corps of Drums]]\n[[Royal Marines Band Service|Royal Marines Bands]] are led by 'buglers', who are trained on both the side drum and the bugle as well as the Herald Fanfare Trumpet (natural trumpet); this section of the band is referred to as \"the Corps of Drums\", which since 1903 is now situated at the front of the band. Whilst similar to Army corps of drums, these are members of the Royal Marines Band Service (RMBS), although they retain their own rank structure.  Members of the RMBS are primarily musicians; however, they also carry out secondary roles (e.g. medics, drivers, force protection etc.) when required to, like their Army counterparts.\n\nRM Buglers have a similar history to Army 'drummers' in that they were used to convey orders on a ship on drums and bugles, and would then mass onshore into corps of drums, though they were still expected to work as individual soldiers,<ref>[http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm Fact Sheet - The Drums of the RM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517130700/http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}</ref> also known in slang by the Royal Navy as drummers.\n\nThese drummer-buglers trace themselves back to the raising of the Royal Marines in 1664 as a maritime foot regiment, with six drummers attached to its battalions.\n\n====History of Maritime Drummers====\nDrums were, in 1664, used for the raising of the [[Royal Marines| Duke of York's and Albany's Maritime Regiment of Foot]], the ''Admiral's Regiment''. The regiment's 1,200 personnel had six snare drummers per company, the ancestors of the corps of drums of the [[Royal Marines Band Service]]. The Holland Regiment soon came after them. They were later to be called ''The Buffs'', the ''Old Buffs'' and ''Howards's Buffs''.\n\nEach time a maritime regiment, or from 1672 onward, a marine regiment, is disbanded and a new one appears in its place, drummers come in, especially the young ones who liked playing drums and wanted to serve playing them. The 1702 formation of the marine and sea-service foot regiments saw the drummers' greatest action at Gibraltar, when they played the drums to support their regiments.\n\nThe [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] saw into action ten British marine regiments and an all-American marine regiment, all units whose drummers and fifers played alongside their units.\n\nEven though part of the [[British Army]] which in the 18th century was led by the War Office, the Board of Ordnance and the Commissariat, marines were naval units. Royal Navy officers were at one point part of the marines. Due to two laws that regulated them and other army and navy units, marine drummers faced a loyalty problem over what drum calls they would have to do, and for what branch and on what occasion they might be required to play drums for orders, commands, etc.\n\nIn 1755, the problem was solved. The Admiralty took over what was then called ''His Majesty's Marine Forces''.  Even though at first Royal Navy officers filled the officer ranks, with lieutenant-colonel being perceived as the highest relevant rank, in 1771 a promotion to colonel occurred for the first time in the H.M.M.F.\n\nAfter their formation, the H.M.M.F's drummers and fifers of the three marine divisions played alongside their fellow soldiers in various landings worldwide on behalf of the Royal Navy. They joined their units in the American War of Independence, and a drummer was at James Cook's service during his sea travels.\n\nAt Adm. John Jervis's insistence, by King George III's order in 1802, the H.M.M.F. was transformed into the ''H.M.M.F.-Royal Marines'', albeit larger than today's establishment. Two years later, bomb vessel crews and gunners became part of the newly created ''Royal Marine Artillery'', in which bugle calls became a regular part of life from then on.\n\nThe Royal Navy in the 19th century was short of manpower in both the H.M.M.F.-R.M. and the R.M.A. For this, Army units joined the H.M.M.F.-R.M. as replacement units, carrying not only their drummers and fifers but also buglers.\n\nIn 1855, during the units' service in the Crimean War, the H.M.M.F.-R.M's foot units became one under the unified title of ''Royal Marines Light Infantry'', later known as the ''Royal Marine Light Infantry''. From then, bugles replaced drums as signallers and order beaters, but the latter would be still useful for drill, being then called ''drummers and buglers'', and from 1867 the R.M.L.I./R.M.A. drummers were called ''buglers'' only, serving individually in ships and the R.N's shore establishments and artillery units and massed into corps of drums for their units on the ground. Fifes fully declined and disappeared in usage. By then, a bugler playing both the drum and his bugle both to sound orders and do drum calls was a common sight in the RMLI and RMA. By the 1890s, even buglers also trained in using herald trumpets or Fanfare trumpets became commonplace in RMLI and RMA bases and facilities.\nA 1902 incident changed the buglers forever. A Coronation Review at [[Aldershot]] was due soon, and the then Sr. Bandmaster of the RMLI, Lt. George Miller, asked his fellow bandmasters to get buglers for his band for the review. The next day at a church parade, he asked 30 RMLI buglers to front the RMLI Massed Bands. They then marched to his own arrangement of Onward Christian Soldiers. Everyone was shocked by this and were amazed that the formation that he used would become a RMLI and RMA military band standard formation setup, and the precision stick drills that he made became a permanent fixture in military events where either or both the RMLI and RMA's presence were needed. Soon later, when the RM began operating the Royal Naval School of Music the next year as a training venue for future bandsmen of the RN, RMLI and RMA, they brought this formation for Royal Navy bands as well, inspiring the formations used by modern military bands of some Commonwealth countries like Australia,  Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\n1923 would see the buglers of the R.M.L.I. and R.M.A. now belong to the ''Corps of Royal Marines'', the Royal Marines of today. Seeing action during the Second World War and in the growing crisis of the [[Cold War]] were the R.M.'s brave buglers of the new '''[[Royal Marines Band Service]]''', even through separate from the bands themselves. The R.M.A. and R.M.L.I. buglers' dress uniforms (dark blue trousers and tunic and red collars and trouser wells) became the full dress of the corps bands and buglers, with the addition of a Wolseley [[pith helmet]] as headdress, and yellow shoulder cords and slashed cuffs to indicate their long history, heritage and lineage from 1664.\n\nBy 1950, the R.N.S.o.M. became today's [[Royal Marines Band Service#Royal Marines School of Music|Royal Marines School of Music]], and the Royal Naval bands were dissolved. Beating retreats by both the Royal Marine bands and the R.M. Corps of Drums buglers would begin to occur annually, later triennially and as of today biannually, at [[Horse Guards Parade]], [[Portsmouth]] and other venues, playing for the entire Royal Navy and the Royal Marines. It would be only in 1978 that the R.M.B.S. would have buglers as well in its rosters. By the 1990s, however, only five R.M. corps of drums were left as the Deal Depot closed down in 1996, the Chatham band already dissolved in the 1940s, with three at the R.N. England bases in [[Portsmouth]], [[Plymouth]] and at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] till 2008 (The last is now assigned to {{HMS|Collingwood|establishment|6}}), one in the R.M.S.o.M. (then in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] and now in Portsmouth since 1996) and another one in [[Scotland]] at HMS ''Caledonia''. By the 1950s, only the band carried the corps at the lead, as separate corps of drums, which played only bugles alongside the drums, were discontinued altogether (these were adopted in the 1880s when the RM began to transition from fifes to bugles).\n\nToday there are six R.M. Bands (plus the training company, R.M.S.o.M. Junior Musicians and Buglers) located around the UK, in Portsmouth (three in HMS Nelson, which includes the R.M.S.o.M.), Fareham (HMS Collingwood), Plymouth (HMS Raleigh), Lympstone (Commando Training Centre Royal Marines) and Scotland (HMS Caledonia) for a total of seven bands and attached corps of drums.  All members of the R.M.B.S. are trained at the Royal Marines School of Music (HMS Nelson). Buglers' training lasts two years. Basic military skills are taught during four months of initial military training and, if successful, trainee buglers are instructed on the bugle, drum and herald/fanfare trumpets. Musical skills are refined and supported with additional lessons in music theory and aural perception. Parade work forms a large part of the curriculum and considerable time is spent developing personal drill and bearing.\n\nToday's R.M. Corps of Drums contains approximately 60 buglers who carry out duties ranging from repatriation services (''Last Post'' and ''Reveille''), mess beatings (drum displays), beating retreat (marching displays) and concerts on behalf of the Royal Marines and the entire Royal Navy.\n\n====Instruments and leadership====\nLike the British Army, Military snare (side) drums (MSD) are the principal instrument of the corps of drums; however, another core instrument is the bugle. Bass drums are often used during parades and drum displays, while cymbals and single tenor drums are used during parades and ceremonies only. Herald Fanfare trumpets (natural trumpets) are also performed on such occasions where a bugle fanfare would be inappropriate for such. The corps is led by a drum major and a bugle major serves as the principal player for it.\n\n===The Drummer's Colour===\n\n[[File:Drummer's colour 2.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Corps of Drums|Drummer]] of the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]] holds the Drummer's Colour.]]\n\nThe Drummer's Colour, also known as the Wilhelmsthal Colour, is a unique [[Military colours, standards and guidons|Colour]] held by 1st Battalion, [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]. A drummer, usually the youngest in the battalion, is detailed to carry it when it is on parade.<ref name=Handbook2019>{{cite web|url=https://thefusiliers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fusiliers-Regimental-Handbook-2019.pdf|title= Regimental Handbook 2019}}</ref>\n\n====History====\nAt the [[battle of Wilhemstahl]] in 1762,The [[5th Foot]] lead the centre column under the command of [[Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick]]. During this action, they captured the Colour of an opposing French regiment, and took a large number of prisoners.<ref name=www.britishempire.co.uk>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/britishinfantry/northumberlandcolour1910.htm|title=www.britishempire.co.uk}}</ref>\nAfter this date, the regiment carried a small green silk banner in addition to their usual stand of Colours to commemorate the one they captured. This was destroyed along with the Regimental Colour by a fire in the [[Mess| Officer's Mess]] in 1833. Despite Representations made to [[King William IV]] refused a request to replace the Drummer's Colour following the fire. However the regiment continued to parade a replacement, and was granted specific permission to do so by [[King George V]] in 1933.<ref name=Handbook2019>{{cite web|url=https://thefusiliers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fusiliers-Regimental-Handbook-2019.pdf|title= Regimental Handbook 2019}}</ref>\n\nSince then, a drummer has been entrusted with carrying the Colour. This is unique within [[infantry]] [[regiments]] of the [[British Army]], since colours are normally only entrusted to [[commissioned officers]], except when they are in the custody of sergeants to convey them to an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Messenger |first1=Charles |title=For Love of Regiment: A History of British Infantry, Volume One, 1660\u20131914 |date=1994 |publisher=Leo Cooper }}</ref> The Drummer's Colour will typically only be paraded on [[St. George's Day]], unlike the other colours of the regiment which are used more frequently. On this day, it is decorated with red and white roses, in keeping with regimental custom which sees all members of the regiment wear the roses in their headdress on this day. The drums of the Corps of Drums and the [[Drum Major|Drum Major's]] staff are also similarly decorated.\n\nWhen the [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers]] were amalgamated with other regiments to form the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]] in 1968, the tradition of carrying the Drummer's Colour was maintained by the 2nd Battalion. When this battalion was in turn 'deleted' in 2014 as a result of the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010]], the Drummer's Colour was passed to the 1st Battalion.\n\n[[File:Drummer's colour.jpg|thumb|A Sergeant Drummer ([[Drum major (military) |Drum Major]]) and Drummer of the [[Northumberland Fusiliers]] with the Drummer's Colour. The staff, Colour, and headdress of both are decorated with red and white roses for [[St. George's Day]].]]\n====Appearance and Charges====\nThe Drummer\u2019s Colour is of gosling green silk edged with gold. [[St. George and the Dragon]] are embroidered in the centre, with red scrolls edged with gold above and below. The motto of the [[Northumberland Fusiliers]] \u2018Quo Fata Vocant\u2019(Go where divine providence leads) is displayed on the upper scroll, and the word \u2018Northumberland\u2019 is on the lower. Above the lower scroll is a large 'V' with 'Regt' below, both in gold, indicating that the Northumberland Fusiliers were the 5th Regiment of Foot at the time of the battle. A laurel wreath with red berries surrounds the central elements, and [[tudor rose]]s surmounted by crowns feature in the four corners.<ref name=handbook>{{cite web|url=http://www.regimentsdirect.co.uk/fusiliers/Content/BRS/Fusiliers%20Regimental%20Handbook.pdf|title=Regimental Handbook|publisher=Regiments Direct|accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===British civilian and cadet corps of drums===\nIn addition to Army and Navy/Royal Marines Corps of Drums, in the [[United Kingdom]] there are also [[Cadet#United Kingdom|cadet]]- civilian corps who base their music on the military traditions of the country.<ref name=\"CoDS-history\"/> The [[Army Cadet Force]] corps use the Army-style formations and instrumentation (flutes/bugles, snare, bass and tenor drums, cymbals and [[Glockenspiel]]s), save for those with Scottish and Irish links that have [[Pipe band]]s instead and those affiliated with the light infantry (especially the now only LI regiment [[The Rifles]]) have a corps of drums without the fifes while using only bugles. Those corps of the [[Combined Cadet Force]], [[Royal Marines Volunteer Cadet Corps]] and the [[Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadet Corps]] use the RN/RM naval and ship-style corps (Snare drums/Bugles, Bass and Tenor drums, cymbals and glockenspiels) and are attached to the main band. This formation is also used by the military band of the [[Duke of York's Royal Military School]]. Another example of a military style CoD is that of the [[Royal British Legion]], whose bands are modeled on the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Band Service. The Royal Air Force however does not have any such ensembles, and only Corps of Drums under the [[Royal Air Force Air Cadets]] are active, with their formation being similar to those of the RN and RM.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police restarted a Corps of Drums in 2011, when the central youth engagement unit purchased some drums and sent cadets on a \"band camp\". Greenwich borough subsequently took a caretaker role of the drums and established a corps of drums. 2015 saw Kensington and Chelsea and Hillingdon Boroughs expanding and creating more branches. It is the first band in the Metropolitan Police to be composed of members of the Metropolitan Police since 1988. It is also the first band in the name of the Metropolitan Police since 1997, when the civilianised Metropolitan Police Band was disbanded.\n\nCivilian corps of drums are also formatted after their respective services, with corps patterned after those of the Army, Navy and the Royal Marines in instrumentation and marching style becoming commonplace. These are staffed by both veteran and retired military drummers as well as civilian drummers playing the fifes, bugles and percussion. In Northern Ireland, civilian corps are mounted by Loyalist groups, which for the most part use flutes with no bugles at all.\n\n==United States==\nA '''corps of drums''' or '''field music band''' in the United States is a type of [[military band]], which originated in European [[Army|armies]] in the 16th century. The main instruments of a corps of drums are the [[drum]] and the [[flute]] or [[Fife (instrument)|fife]] and [[bugle]]. Unlike 'full' [[Military band|military marching bands]], corps of drums usually exist within an [[infantry]] [[battalion]]. A [[Drum major (military)|drum major]] is the leader of a corps of drums, and in the past a fife major served as the principal fifer or flautist with a bugle major serving the same purpose for the buglers.\n\n[[Valley Forge Military Academy and College]] has a corps of drums that is part of the regimental band. Uniforms and music are modelled on the Royal Marines Corps of Drums. VFMAC does have a similar but separate formation which is part of the Corps of Cadets (VFMAC Field Music) which only uses drums (snares, tenors and basses), cymbals and bugles and from 2011, fifes. Formed in 1956, it also provides the official guard-of-honour for visitors to the Delaware Valley area.\n\nThe [[United States Army]] [[Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps]], raised in 1960 and part of the [[3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)]] of the [[United States Army]], formally revived this very part of American military music history and its mission is to relive it for coming generations. This is the only musical unit of the US armed forces in which its drum major, wearing a classic 18th century infantry cap and carrying a [[spontoon]], the honor badge and weapon of 18th century senior non-commissioned officers, salutes using the left hand. Musicians assigned to this unit wear 18th century military uniforms reminiscent of those used in the [[American Revolutionary War]] by the [[Continental Army]] drummers and fifers. Another corps of drums is found as part of the [[West Point Band]] - the West Point Hellcats, which wear regulation uniforms from the 1820s, and since 2016 play using bugles, fifes and traditional rope tension snare and bass drums.  Until the late 19th century the US Army and the [[United States Marine Corps]] maintained similar ensembles before switching to bugles.\n\n=== Formation of field music/corps of drums in the US Armed Forces and civilian organizations === \nWhile only the Old Guard FDC is the only field music formation in the US Armed Forces and thus more similar to a European corps of drums, in the past there had been similar formations armed forces-wide. Should such units be reactivated again not just in the Armed Forces but also as civilian, veterans or youth cadet formations, the formation of the ensemble is as follows (the formation is to be expected to be led by a drum major):\n\n* Field snare drums\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Cymbals (optional)\n* Single tenor drums (optional)\n* Glockenspiels (optional)\n* Fifes\n* Piccolos, Flutes\n* Bugles in B and/or G Major\n* Chromatic fanfare Trumpets in B or G Major (optional)\n* Single-valve bugles (Only in the Old Guard FDC)\n* Soprano and Baritone Herald Fanfare Bugles (optional)\n* Soprano and Baritone Herald fanfare trumpets (optional)\n* Soprano Bugles\n* Alto bugles\n* Flugelhorn Bugles\n* Mellophones\n* Baritone Bugles\n* Marching Baritones\n* Contrabass bugles\n\n==Germany==\nIn Germany, ''Spielmannszug'', ''Tambourkorps'' and  sometimes ''Trommlerkorps'' are the names given to the German corps of drums, whether it is a military formation or a civilian formation. The instrumentation of these are, commonly fifes and snare drums (just like the [[Bundeswehr]] corps of drums that are attached to the unit military bands), [[flute]]s and [[piccolo]]s, [[Glockenspiel]]s, Bass drums, cymbals and, on some corps, single and multiple tenor drums, and like their British counterparts, bugles (in several corps). [[Timpani]], [[vibraphone]]s and [[marimba]]s are used in concerts. Sometimes even a [[Turkish crescent]] is used to symbolize the band. Whatever the configuration, a drum major always leads the corps during military and civil parades and other events, and in modern corps even majorettes and pom pom dancers are a part of its roster.\n\nMilitary corps of drums belong and are attached to the bands of the Bundeswehr [[Military bands of the Bundeswehr|Military Music Center]] under the Bundeswehr [[Streitkr\u00e4ftebasis]] while civilian corps are dedicated civil bands and youth bands assigned in cities and towns all over Germany.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1990, the [[National People's Army]] maintained corps of drums in the same manner as the Bundeswehr. During the Republic Day parades on 7 October in East Berlin from 1959 to 1989, the national corps included single tenor drums at the front.\n\n==Russia/CIS==\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e \u0414\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0417\u0412\u041e (5).jpg|thumb|Drummers of the [[Minsk Suvorov Military School]] on the avenue during a parade in 2017.]]\nRussian '''{{transl|ru|Barabanshchiki}}''' or drummers are names that are used to refer to Russian military corps of drums ({{lang|ru|\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432}}, {{transl|ru|rota barabanshchikom}}), a practice that is of Imperial origin in the field drummers that marched at the lead of their units in parades and that is a part of the traditions of almost all former Soviet republics (save for the Baltics and Georgia). Russian drum corps are usually made up of snare drummers with one line of [[flute]] or [[fife]] players in the middle and two [[glockenspiel]]s in the front (with the option for a third one or a [[Turkish crescent]], plus chromatic fanfare trumpeters, buglers and trumpeters). Military corps of drums are usually made separate from the massed military bands of the unit or command that it is a part of, and are led by a drum major who is a commissioned officer of minimum junior officer rank.\n\n[[File:Azerbaijan Armed Forces.jpg|thumb|An Azerbaijani corps of drums]]\n\nHistorically, the corps of drums is a military unit that is formally a part of the junior military high schools of these countries. Uniquely, the [[Azerbaijani Armed Forces]] follows the Turkish models by attaching a full bugle formation behind the corps of drums.\n\n===List of Post-Soviet units/institutions with corps of drums===\n*[[Moscow Military Music College]]\n*Kronstadt Sea Cadet Corps \n*Ussuriysk Suvorov Military School\n*Yekaterinburg Suvorov Military School\n*Vladivostok Nakhimov Naval School\n*Baltic Fleet Naval Training Center Sevastopol\n*[[Minsk Suvorov Military School]]\n*[[Ivan Bohun Military High School]]\n*[[Monte Melkonian Military College]]\n*[[Azerbaijan Higher Military Academy]]\n*[[Astana Zhas Ulan Republican School]]\n*[[Mastibek Tashmukhamedov Military Lyceum of the Ministry of Defense of Tajikistan]]\n*[[Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense of Turkmenistan]]\n*[[Military Music College of Mongolia]]\n*Georgi Atanasov Military Music School (until 2001<ref>https://m.dnevnik.bg/print/arhiv_pari/2001/08/01/1544686_zakrivat_uchilishte_zaradi_lipsa_na_pari/amp</ref>)\n\n== Sweden ==\nOnly the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]] King's Guard Battalion has a corps of drums organized as a platoon - the [[Svea Corps of Drums]] (''F\u00e4ltpipark\u00e5ren/Livgardets trumk\u00e5r'') which is part of the Life Guards Company. Until 2009 the Royal Swedish Army Drum Corps served as the official active field music unit of both the Army and the entire Armed Forces, and thus only the [[Home Guard (Sweden)|Home Guard Command]] maintains the practice with dedicated ensembles in several areas of the country.\n\n== Canada ==\nThe sole corps of drums that is active within the [[Canadian Army]] today is the Corps of Drums of [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]]. Being a musical unit, it replaces the regimental band of the PPCLI, which was dissolved in 1994. Based on the British tradition for these units, it is modeled on the Corps of Drums of the [[Royal Logistics Corps]] of the [[British Army]]. The regimental drum corps is divided into three units which are assigned to different battalions in the PPCLI. These individual drum corps operate as small drum lines that serve during different ceremonies and events. Unlike their British and American counterparts, but more similar to the Corps of Drums of the RLC, the drum corps does not utilize [[flutes]] and bugles. An example of a historical corps of drums can be found through the [[Fort Henry Guard]] and the [[Fort York Guard]], both of which sport corps of drums that include [[fife]]s and are led by a Drum Major and a Drum Sergeant. Although it is not part of the Canadian Forces, it is designed to represent the units of the [[British Army]] in [[Upper Canada]]. During WWII, many regiments maintained small corps of drums that were stationed at all\nmajor bases. While most of them were staffed by active duty troops, others were staffed by volunteer bandsmen, consisting of reservists and professional civilian percussionists.<ref>http://www.dcxmuseum.org/assets/15%2520-%2520Canadian%2520Military%2520erum%2520and%2520Bugle%2520Corps.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjJw9qw5tPmAhUFXM0KHdBUBu4QFjARegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw2p9l-GZYX4FDm3EkT4dJFS</ref>\n\nIn the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], corps of drums have been historically attached to military bands at the front-rank following the precedent the [[Royal Marines Band Service|bands]] of the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Corps of Royal Marines]]. After the 1968 [[Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces]], corps of drums in both the RCN, were dismantled and abolished, although notably making a return in the mid-1980s within the naval reserve. In July 2013, a five-person corps of drums was unveiled for the first time by the [[Naden Band of Maritime Forces Pacific]] a [[Victoria Day]] Parade.<ref>http://www.lookoutnewspaper.com/corps-of-drums-return-to-band/</ref>\n\n==Netherlands and in Indonesia==\n''Drum bands'' are the Dutch and Indonesian terms for the corps of drums, but in the [[Netherlands]] they are also called as ''drumfanfares'', ''tamboerkorps'', ''trompetterkorps'' and ''klaroenkorps'' (''drum and lyre bands, [[fanfare band]]s and drum and brass bands'') and in [[Indonesia]] as ''marching bands'' and ''drum corps''.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the basic instrumentation is\n\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Multiple and single tenor drums\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* Flutes, Fifes\n* Bugles, Natural trumpets, [[fanfare trumpet]]s\n* Natural horns (few bands only)\n* Turkish crescent (optional)\n* [[Brass section]]/[[Marching brass]] (in few bands)\n\nMilitary drum bands in the [[armed forces of the Netherlands]] would have only two to four of these basic instruments.\n\nOptional or permanent instruments in these bands are flutes and piccolos, bugles, natural horns, valved bugles and brass instruments (soprano bugles and trumpets, cornets, horns, mellophones, baritones, sousaphones and contrabass bugles).\n\nThese bands are attached to the main marching band, similar to French bands, but also perform as stand alone bands. They are led by a drum major, and can have [[majorette (dancer)|majorette]]s and [[colour guard]]s, the latter now more separated from the band.\n\nIn the 1990s however these bands became paramilitary-styled and even adopted the traditions of British military bands of the Guards Division and the Royal Marines, but several of these bands chose the American marching band and drum and bugle corps practice. Some of these bands also adopted woodwind instruments turning them into full-time military marching bands, and almost all drum bands use English voice commands and not Dutch commands and only a few use whistle commands and the mace movements.\n\nIn Indonesia, the corps, a military musical heritage from Dutch colonial times, may be treated as military, civil or school marching and show bands, and in some cases as [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|drum and bugle corps]], and are either attached to the main marching band or as stand-alone bands, with instrumentation drawn from the following:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Single tenor drums\n* Multiple tenor drums\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* [[Melodica]]s (in school marching bands)\n* [[Fanfare trumpet]]s (chromatic and/or herald) (optional)\n* [[Bugle]]s (optional)\n* Flutes, piccolos (in the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]])\n* Fifes (optional in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[Clarinet]]s (in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[Trumpet]]s, [[cornet]]s and soprano bugles\n* Alto bugles\n* [[Flugelhorn]]s and flugel bugles\n* [[Trombone]]s (optional in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[French horn|Horn]]s, [[mellophone]]s and horn bugles\n* Baritone bugles, [[baritone horn]]s and marching baritones\n* [[Wagner tuba]]s (optional)\n* [[Tuba]]s, [[euphonium]]s, [[saxhorn]]s (optional)\n* [[Contrabass bugle]]s, [[sousaphone]]s\n''If a civilian front ensemble is present'':\n* [[Marimba]]\n* [[Vibraphone]]\n* Xylophone\n* Suspended cymbals\n* Tubular bells\n* Gong\n* Drum kit\n* Timpani\n\nThey are led by from one to six [[Drum major (military)|drum major]]s and can have a separate director of music (in civil and police bands only), majorettes and [[color guard (flag spinning)|Colour guard]]s (optional). The drum majors in these bands have a unique use of the mace in order to coordinate the timing and precision of the band like US marching band drum majors do. The Indonesian corps also has dancing bass drummers either wearing uniforms or costumes (such is the case in the corps of drums of the various Indonesian uniformed organizations, most especially the armed forces and the national police), a unique feature of these corps and are attached to it and are also a nod to Indonesian cultural traditions, plus dancing contrabass buglers and baritone buglers in some bands. The brass instruments are pitched in C, F or B major unlike US military DBCs, most notably that of the [[United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps]] that use G major brasses and civilian corps in the past, and so too are the glockenspiels being used and the flutes and clarinets.\n\nAnother unique characteristic is that in military and police corps of drums, tenor and bass drummers, baritone buglers (optionally) and contrabass buglers wear combat, duty or everyday uniform (and optionally costumes for the tenor drummers) instead of the full dress uniform while playing, whether in performance, field practice or rehearsals, unlike their British counterparts do. They wear [[beret]]s, [[ball cap]]s or [[side cap]]s as head-dress, unlike the rest of the band, who wear [[peaked cap]]s, especially the drum majors and in civil bands, the director of music, the color guards and the pit section during field performances. Bands of the Armed Forces academies tend to have their single tenor drummers wear their specialty uniform and colored berets of the selected service arm or branch, with those of the Navy wearing free diving gear and the Air Force flightsuits.\n\n=== Ancient style corps of drums in Indonesia ===\n\nThe practice was introduced to the Netherlands East Indies in the early 1800s, and today both the [[Yogyakarta Kraton Guards]] and the Royal Guard of [[Pakualaman]] each sport an ancient form of the corps, alongside a recently reconstituted formation from the Royal Guard of the [[Surakarta Sunanate]]. Alongside them, both the southern regencies of Central Java and Yogyakarta have dedicated civilian corps, each serving the ''bregodo rakyat'' (''people's brigade'') companies that conserve the traditions of the armed services of the former sultanates. These corps, when formed up in parade, are composed of:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Fifes, flutes, [[suling]] flutes\n* Bugle/s\n* Trumpet/s (in some civil bands)\n* One to three [[Kendang]]s\n* Single tenor drum/s (in civil bands)\n* Cymbals\n* Bass drum (in civil bands and in Surakarta)\n* Gong/s\n\n==South America==\nInspired by the German (and sometimes French) style corps of drums, South American corps differ in instrumentation, size and leadership.\n\n===Chile===\nSimilar to the German corps, the Chilean corps of drums are both military and civil bands, the ''Bandas de Guerra'' (War Bands) that the Chileans call them formally.\n\nMilitary corps of drums belong to the Chilean Armed Forces' three services, the [[Carabineros de Chile]] and the [[Chilean Gendarmerie]] and differ in instrumentation and officers in charge (only in the Chilean Navy).\n\n*[[Chilean Army]]: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*[[Chilean Navy]]: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major)\n*[[Chilean Air Force]]: Snare drums, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*Chilean Carabiners: Snare drums, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*Chilean Gendarmerie: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n\nThe military style corps also inherit the British corps' tradition of carrying drummers' swords attached to belts in all their dress uniforms.\n\nCivilian corps are usually school based bands with the addition of a percussion section (Snare drums, bass drums and cymbals) and glockenspiels and are either part of a school marching band or as a standalone band in itself. In these separate bands, a fife major leads the band's fifers/flautists while on duty, and also assist the drum major and the bugle major. These positions also exists on corps which are now part of school bands, as well as in a few volunteer community fire departments. These civil corps perform on occasions when requested and participate in competitions.\n\n===Ecuador===\nCorps of drums in Ecuador are both military and civil bands. These corps are very similar to the German corps, but with the addition of bugles and the single tenor drum.\n\nLike the Chilean corps, these bands have differences in configuration and instrumentation in the Ecuadorian armed forces. But the corps snare and tenor (sometimes bass) drummers often play on drums that are painted in the service or unit colours (sometimes in the colours of Guayaquil, which are blue and white for the corps of the [[Ecuadorian Navy]]) and in the case of the Military Academy \"Eloy Alfaro\" and the Air Force Academy \"Cosme Rendella\", have the unit/school insignia attached to the bugles' and fifes' tabards.\n\nThe typical Ecuadorian corps, called as the ''Peloton Comando'' (Commando Platoon) but are also called as the ''Banda de Guerra'' (War Band), just like in Chile in several schools and colleges (many bands now fall under the ''Banda Escolar'' or ''Banda de Paz'' title due to recent state reforms), is led by a drum major (in several cases there would be 1 to 4 drum majors) and is composed of:\n\n*Snare drums\n*Fifes (common only in the Ecuadorian Army and Ecuadorian Air Force and school bands)\n*Bugles and natural trumpets (common in all three services, principal instrument in the Ecuadorian Navy)\n*Single tenor drums\n*Bass drums (optional and common in some corps)\n*Cymbals (optional and in some corps)\n*Glockenspiels\n*Multiple tenor drums (only in school bands)\n\nEcuadorian Civil corps of drums are similar only to the Army and Air Force corps but are based as youth bands stationed in schools across the nation. Notable exceptions include the Corps of Drums of the Ecuadorian National Police. Like military corps, they are led by a drum major in all their activities but there are cases of multiple drum majors leading, from a minimum of two to a maximum of four or five. But in some corps, there are some majorettes and tambourine players. Those that are based on the Navy's corps of drums (especially [[Guayaquil]]-based corps) use the same instrumentation as its corps have.\n\n===Venezuela===\nSimilar to Germany and Colombia's, the Venezuelan corps of drums are both military and civil bands, and like Colombia's, Peru's and Ecuador's contain the same instrumentation of :\n\n*Snare drums\n*Bass drums\n*Cymbals\n*Single tenor drums\n*Glockenspiels\n*Bugles (and optionally trumpets)\n\nThe corps is led by a single drum major. In some corps, especially in civil-based ones, other brass instruments may be added into the bugle section.\n\nMilitary corps have tabards applied on the bass drums, snare drums, glockenspiels and bugles on every occasion that it is performing. One such formation is the Military Academy of Venezuela Corps of Drums. Recently there's an effort to build up full-time military marching bands in the national armed forces with the percussion of the corps combined with brass and woodwind instruments.\n\n===Bolivia===\nCorps of drums in Bolivia, both military and civil, are inspired by German and French band practices and are part of the main band. The instruments used by them are snare drums, tenor drums (single and multiple), bass drums, cymbals and sometime glockenspiels. Turkish crescents are used as standards and are paraded as part of them. In military corps attached to bands there would be one to two drum majors and in some cases standards or vertical banners are used to distinguish the corps when on parade. Civil corps attached to [[marching band]]s would have one to eight drum majors (in some cases ten) and would also have a military-styled colour guard marching with the Turkish crescents and optionally the standards.\n\n===Peru===\nPeruvian corps of drums are both military (''Banda de guerra'') and civil bands (''Banda ritmica''), with differences in instrumentation. In whatever combination, it's a main part of the main school or military marching band led by the Director of Music, with the drum major or majorette or standard bearer leading led by the conductor or as a separate band led by the drum major or standard bearer at the front of the ensemble. These follow the Spanish and French influence.\n\nCorps of drums in the [[Peruvian Armed Forces]] and the [[National Police of Peru]] (formerly the Civil Guard of Peru, Peruvian Investigations Police and Peruvian Republican Guard), plus school or college based bands and corps attached to them or as separate bands are composed of snare and or field drums, single tenor drums, multiple tenor drum (in school corps), bugles and glockenspiels in addition to the regular snare and bass drums and cymbals. [[Tambourine]]s are common within the school-based corps, with female [[majorette (dancer)|majorette]]s assisting the conductor or the school band drum major or music director. Tabards are applied only on the bugles and glockenspiels, as well as in the snare and tenor drums if applicable.\n\n===Colombia===\nColombian corps of drums ar similar to those of Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Venezuela but are different in leadership, being led by a minimum of 3-7 drum majors or majorettes, and are composed instrumentally of:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Field/precision snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Single tenor drums\n* Multiple tenor drums (civil corps)\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* Bugles and trumpets\n* Natural trumpets (military corps only and in several civil corps)\n* [[Trombones]] (optional, only in select military corps)\n* [[Saxhorns]] (only in select military corps)\n* [[Bagpipes]] (in the corps of drums of the [[Colombian Naval Academy]] and the Basic School of the [[Colombian Naval Infantry]])\n* Tambourines (civil corps)\n* Conga drums (civil Corps)\n* Timbales (civil corps)\n* Cowbells (civil corps)\n* Suspended cymbals (civil corps)\n\nCivil corps would also have a separate conductor, occasionally standard bearers and [[colour guard]]s marching along.\n\nEven through separate from the main marching band, a part of the band itself or as a band of its own, they are both useful as military-based and civil-based marching bands. The drums are either covered with cloth tabards of the unit or band to which the corps belongs, or painted in various colours to suit its needs.  The bugles, trumpets and glockenspiels (and in military units and several civil bands, natural trumpets) are attached with small tabards with the military service, police, school or college insignia, name or emblem shown in them.\n\n== Central America ==\nKnown as ''Bandas de Guerra'' or ''banda tradicional'' in Spanish, the Corps of drums tradition is also active in the following Central American countries:\n\n* [[Guatemala]]\n* [[El Salvador]]\n* [[Honduras]]\n* [[Panama]]\n\nThe Guatemalan corps tradition is mostly active in school-based corps, which mirror drum and bugle corps of the US and Mexico.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

In July 1909, on only her second voyage, the ship, en route from [[Durban]] to [[Cape Town]], disappeared with 211 passengers and crew aboard. No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Design and construction==\nIn September 1907 W. Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W. Taverner, wife of the Agent-General of Victoria, being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=1125741|shipname=Waratah|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=mar>{{cite news |title=Launches-Scotch. |date=1 October 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=92 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nThe ship was of the spar-deck type, and had three complete decks \u2013 lower, main and spar. The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day. At the time of construction, ''Waratah'' was not equipped with a radio, which was not unusual at the time.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=118|ps=}}\n\nThe sea trials were held on 23 October 1908 on the Firth of Clyde, during which the steamer was able to successfully maintain a mean speed of {{convert|15|kn|mph km/h}} over several runs on the measured mile.

The fire was largely brought under control by noon on the same day but continued reigniting until 10 December. The fire was apparently caused by the heat emitted by several reducing and steam valves located on the starboard side of the engine room. While the roof of the engine room was insulated, the starboard side was evidently not. The repairs were performed at Sydney to the chief engineer's satisfaction.\n\nDuring her maiden trip the steamer was scrutinized by the Captain and the crew, as one of the criteria used in acceptance trials was the ship's handling and stability. Captain Ilbery was not completely satisfied and, considering he was previously in charge of ''Geelong'', presumably reported to the owners that the ship did not have the same stability as his old vessel. He was especially concerned with the difficulty of properly loading the steamer to maintain her stability, which resulted in a heated exchange between the owners and the builders following the vessel's return to England.\n\nThe subsequent inquiry into her sinking raised some disputed reports of instability on this voyage.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article77352720 |title=THE S.S.

Sawyer, an engineer and experienced sea traveller, left the ship and sent the following [[Telegram|cable]] to his wife in London: \"Thought Waratah top-heavy, landed Durban\". Sawyer later testified to the London inquiry that he had booked passage on ''Waratah'' through to Cape Town, but had decided to disembark at Durban, as he had been nervous about the behaviour of the ship during his voyage. He also claimed that he had been disturbed by visions he saw in dreams during the voyage of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" Sawyer claimed that he took these visions to be a warning to leave the ship at the earliest opportunity. In any event his decision to leave the ship at Durban saved his life.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n===Disappearance===\nThe ''Waratah'' left Durban at approximately 20:15 on 26 July with 211 passengers and crew. At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight, speeding gradually away from ''Clan MacIntyre'' until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. This was the final confirmed sighting of ''Waratah''. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThere were several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nAt around 17:30 on the 27th, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw the smoke of a steamer on the horizon, there was so much smoke that her captain wondered if the steamer was on fire. When darkness fell, the crew of the ''Harlow'' could see the steamer's running lights approaching, but still {{convert|10|to|12|mi|km}} behind them, when there were suddenly two bright flashes from the direction of the steamer and the lights vanished. The captain thought they were caused by explosions, but the mate of the ''Harlow'' who had also seen them, thought the flashes were brush fires on the shore (a common phenomenon in the area at that time of year). The captain agreed and did not even enter the events in the log \u2013 only when he learnt of the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' did he think the events significant.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=122, 138|ps=}} Reportedly the ''Harlow'' was {{convert|180|mi|km}} from Durban.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24189442/the_new_york_times/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 September 1909 |page=6 |title=Saw Steamer Blow Up. |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=1 October 2018}}{{free access}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=24 September 1909 |title=The Loss of the Waratah. |page=12 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24189605/the_times/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=1 October 2018}}{{free access}}</ref>\n\nThat same evening at around 21:30 the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=122, 138|ps=}}\n\nAnother possible sighting, which was not disclosed to the Inquiry at the time, was by Edward Joe Conquer, a [[Cape Mounted Riflemen|Cape Mounted Rifleman]] who on 28 July 1909, was posted to carry out military exercises on the banks of the mouth of the [[Xora River]] along with Signaller H.Adshead. He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under. He reported his sightings to his base camp and to his Orderly Sergeant, who apparently did not take the matter seriously.

No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Search efforts==\n===Contemporary searches===\nInitially, the non-appearance of the ship did not cause alarm as it was not uncommon for ships to arrive at port days, or occasionally even weeks overdue. As ''Waratah'' was considered unsinkable, it was at first thought likely that she had been delayed by a breakdown or mechanical fault, and was still adrift. Fears started to grow for her safety, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''. The ''Hermes'', near the area of the last sighting of the ''Waratah'', encountered waves so large and strong that she strained her hull and had to be placed in [[dry dock]] on her return to port.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=125|ps=}} On 10 August 1909, a cable from South Africa reached Australia, reading \"Blue Anchor vessel sighted a considerable distance out.

In 1910 relatives of ''Waratah'' passengers chartered the ''Wakefield'' which conducted a search for four months covering 15,000 miles, which again proved unsuccessful.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=51\u2013153|ps=}}\n\nOn 15 December 1909, ''Waratah'' was officially posted as missing at [[Lloyds of London]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=128|ps=}} \n\nNo confirmed wreckage or bodies from the ''Waratah'' have ever been found, although there were a number of unconfirmed reports: Wreckage was reported to have been found at [[Mossel Bay]] in March 1910.<ref>[http://waratahrevisited.blogspot.com/2016/04/wreckage-mossel-bay.html Sydney Morning Herald 4 March 1910]</ref> A life preserver reportedly marked with the name 'Waratah' washed up on the coast of New Zealand in February 1912.<ref name=\"Tales\"/> In 1925 Lt.

Several investigations into this wreck, in particular under the leadership of [[Emlyn Brown]], took place. It has proven particularly difficult to explain why the ''Waratah'' should be found so far to the north of her estimated position. Further attempts to locate the ''Waratah'' took place in 1983, 1989, 1991, 1995 and 1997. In 1999 reports reached the newspapers that the ''Waratah'' had been found 10&nbsp;km off the eastern coast of South Africa.<ref>Addley</ref> A sonar scan conducted by Emlyn Brown's team had indeed located a wreck whose outline seemed to match that of the ''Waratah''. In 2001, however, a dive to the site revealed that the wreck was in fact that of the ''[[Nailsea Meadow]]'', a merchant cargo ship that had fallen victim to a German [[U-boat]] during the Second World War.<ref>{{cite web |title=Search for Waratah goes on after 'false' find |url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/search-for-waratah-goes-on-after-false-find-58947 |publisher=IOL |accessdate=2 September 2018 |date=24 January 2001}}</ref> In 2004 Emlyn Brown, who had by then spent 22 years looking for the ''Waratah'', declared that he was giving up the search: \"I've exhausted all the options.

It quickly came to focus on the supposed instability of the ''Waratah''.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=129|ps=}} Evidence was greatly hampered by the lack of any survivors from the ship's final voyage (other than the small number, including Claude Sawyer, who had disembarked in [[Durban]]). Most evidence came from passengers and crew from ''Waratah's'' maiden voyage, her builders and those who had handled her in port.\n\nThe expert witnesses all agreed that the ''Waratah'' was designed and built properly and sailed in good condition.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=130|ps=}} She had passed numerous inspections, including those by her builders, her owners, the Board of Trade and two by [[Lloyd's of London]], who gave her the classification \"+100 A1\"&nbsp;\u2013 their top rating,{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=118, 130|ps=}} granted only to ships Lloyds had inspected and assessed throughout the design, construction, fitting out and [[sea trial]]s, on top of the two valuations and inspections Lloyds had made of the completed ''Waratah''.\n\nHowever many witnesses who had travelled on the ship testified that the ''Waratah'' felt unstable, frequently [[Angle of list|listed]] to one side even in calm conditions, [[Ship motions|rolled]] excessively, and was very slow to come upright after leaning into a swell, and had a tendency for her [[bow (ship)|bow]] to dip into oncoming waves rather than ride over them.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\"/><ref name=\"NLAInqreport\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5235069 |title=THE WARATAH.

This passenger, physicist Professor [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]], concluded that the ship's [[metacentric height|metacentre]] was just below her [[centre of gravity]]. When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite. Both former passengers and crew members (ranking from stokers to a deck officer) said the ''Waratah'' was perfectly stable, with a comfortable, easy roll.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=133|ps=}} Many said they felt she was especially stable.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5153599 |title=THE S.S. WARATAH AND HER COMMANDER. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |volume=LI |issue=15,652 |location=South Australia |date=16 December 1908 |accessdate=4 September 2018 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The ship's builders produced calculations to prove that even with a load of coal on her deck (that several witnesses claim she was carrying when she left Durban) she was not top heavy.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=130|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry was unable to make any conclusions from this mixed and contradictory evidence. It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Design and construction==\nIn September 1907 W. Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W. Taverner, wife of the Agent-General of Victoria, being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=1125741|shipname=Waratah|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=mar>{{cite news |title=Launches-Scotch. |date=1 October 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=92 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nThe ship was of the spar-deck type, and had three complete decks \u2013 lower, main and spar. The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers.

''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight, speeding gradually away from ''Clan MacIntyre'' until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. This was the final confirmed sighting of ''Waratah''. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThere were several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nAt around 17:30 on the 27th, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw the smoke of a steamer on the horizon, there was so much smoke that her captain wondered if the steamer was on fire.

He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under.

Fears started to grow for her safety, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather.

However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.
