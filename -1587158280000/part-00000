The commercials for the \"Back to Magic\" and \"Witchy Princesses\" lines never said Bratzillaz in them, only \"House of Witchez\".\n\nDue to the hiatus that MGA took in 2014 to rebuild the Bratz brand, production of Bratzillaz dolls ended and they were discontinued.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bratzboulevard.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/the-announcement-is-here/|title=\"The Announcement\" is Here!|date=8 January 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Dolls==\nEach doll (with the exception of the Core (Basic Line) dolls) has glass eyes with an articulated, posable body.

In August, MGA released the first Bratzillaz webisode to the official website and YouTube channel. A second webisode was released weeks later on September 11, 2012. The first season aired until January 4, 2013. A second season was expected to be released due to a leaked unreleased webisode titled \"Fashion Bites\" and parts of it being featured at the end of \"Midnight Beach\" when Yasmina looks into the future. However, due to MGA taking a hiatus with the Bratz line in 2014 to rebuild the brand, production of the dolls ended and a second season was never completed.\n\nFrom June 24, 2013 to July 22, 2013, there was a short series of videos about the Witchy Princesses titled \"Witchy Princesses Adventure\" which was not considered part of the webisode series.\n\n{{Episode table |background=#C276EC |overall= |title= |airdate= |viewers= |country=US|released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 1\n|Title= Welcome To Bratzillaz Academy!\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|8|15}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz first arrive at the Bratzillaz Academy, meet Headmistress Magika, and are given capes that give them their own special powers.\n|Viewers=1.88\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 2\n|Title= Furry Frenzy\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|9|11}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz meet Levitor and are each given their own pet.\n|Viewers=0.96\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 3\n|Title= Double Trouble\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|9|25}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz meet the Toola Twins and prepare to head off to their first class, Purses and Potions.\n|Viewers=1.01\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 4\n|Title= Pur-Fecting Boy Chat\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|10|9}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz help prepare Sashabella Paws for her first video chat with her crush, Igneus, as she is very nervous.\n|Viewers=0.61\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 5\n|Title= The Rrr-runway\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|10|24}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz pets star in their very own fashion show after they feel left out of seeing the Bratzillaz have one.\n|Viewers=0.76\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 6\n|Title= In the Big Screen\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|11|7}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz sneak into see Jade J'Adore's favorite movie, but ruin it for her and make it up by sending her into the movie.\n|Viewers=0.42\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 7\n|Title= Later, Alligator\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|11|20}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz have to magically create an Alligator purse in Purses and Potions, and quickly try to fix things when they go wrong.\n|Viewers=0.36\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 8\n|Title= Headlines and Deadlines\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|12|11}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz try to figure out how the Toola Twins always seem to beat Levitor in submitting breaking news into the school paper.\n|Viewers=0.62\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 9\n|Title= Midnight Beach\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2013|1|4}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz are given help from Vampelina and Fianna Fins to find Cloetta Spelletta's pet, Barkthalameow, when they lose him at the Midnight Beach.\n|Viewers=1.25\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 10\n|Title= Fashion Bites ''(Unreleased)''\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|N/A}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz have a competition at Gloomingdale's to see who can find the best purchase.\n|Viewers= N/A\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n}}\n\n===Witchy Princesses Adventure===\n* '''\"Week One\"''' (June 24, 2013) The Bratzillaz seek for information about the Witchy Princesses after Sashabella hears the three birds of the three Princesses crying.\n* '''\"Week Two\"''' (July 1, 2013) The Bratzillaz seek to find a book about the Witchy Princesses, only to find it is missing pages.\n* '''\"Week Three\"''' (July 8, 2013) The Bratzillaz look for two of the pages in Caf\u00e9 Zap and in the Toola Twins' room.\n* '''\"Week Four\"''' (July 15, 2013) The Bratzillaz look for the third missing page to finally restore the book.\n* '''\"Week Five\"''' (July 22, 2013) The Bratzillaz repair the book to discover what happened to the Witchy Princesses.\n\n==Characters==\n===Bratzillaz=== \nThe Bratzillaz are the witch cousins of the Bratz, according to the ''Bratzillaz'' theme song. Also according to the song, it was revealed that all of the Bratzillaz found out their witchy identities at age 16. Yasmina Clairvoya is assumed to be the cousin of Yasmin, Cloetta Spelletta is Cloe's cousin; Meygana Broomstix is Meygan's cousin (Though Meygan was never the main character in the ''Bratz'' franchise); also Sashabella Paws is the Bratz' Sasha's cousin though Sashabella is nicknamed \"Sasha\", which is her human cousin's name, by Cloetta in the episode \"Pur-Fecting Boy Chat\". Also Jade J'Adore is the cousin of Jade, having the same first name as Jade, her cousin. The others are original characters with only Fianna being based on another Brat. Vampelina, Victoria Antique, Illiana Honestly, and Angelica Sound are all original characters. Each Bratzilla has a witch's birthmark known as a \"witchmark\".\n\nUnlike the original Bratz, the Bratzillaz all have revealed last names.\n\nNone of them are the cousins of the Bratz shown in the [[Bratz (TV series)|''Bratz'' television series]]: the franchise about a magazine; though the webisodes of ''Bratzillaz (House of Witchez)'' do have a pair of evil blond female twins.\n\n====Main Bratzillaz====\n'''Yasmina Clairvoya''' - (similar to [[Yasmin (Bratz)|Yasmin]]): Yasmina has the power to see the future. She loves vintage romantic looks, retro style and funky braided hair. With her spellbinding style and oddball pet, Winkers, she stands out as a unique individual. Her witchmark is an Egyptian eye, and her color is purple. She is very dedicated to ''always'' having good fashion, as in the web series for the webisode: \"Rrr-runway\", when Sashabella said: \"Exactly. Imagine how you would feel if you had ''no'' stylish clothes\", Yasmina responded with: \"Are you ''trying'' to give me nightmares?\" Yasmina's surname \"Clairvoya\" is a pun on the word \"clairvoyant\", referring to her witch power to predict the future. Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. She is the Bratz girl Yasmin's witch cousin.\n\n'''Cloetta Spelletta''' - (similar to [[Cloe (Bratz)|Cloe]]): Cloetta and her mixed up cat/dog pet, Barkthalameow, has the power to mutate people into anything they want. She adores two-tone fashions, over-the-knee boots, sparkly capes and hair that goes straight and curly. She loves looks in two-sided colors. Her witchmark is a moon & stars, and her colors are pink and black. She has [[heterochromia]]. Cloetta's family name \"Spelletta\" is a play on the word \"spell\" referring to her metamorphosis magic. Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. She is the Cloe Brat's cousin.\n\n'''Meygana Broomstix''' - (similar to [[List of Bratz characters#Meygan|Meygan]]): Meygana and her winged pet, Wingzy, not only have the power to fly, but also make dreams come true. She loves all shades of the blue sky, late night parties, cloud hopping, fluttery capes and helping people's wildest dreams take flight. She loves sporty supernatural looks. Her witchmark is a pair of wings, and her color is blue. Meygana's last name \"Broomstix\" refers to how in traditional witch folklore or stereotypes of witches float on a [[broom]]stick. The name is a reference to the term \"broomsticks\", which is also referring to her ability to \"make dreams take flight\". Even Meygana's ditzy and free-spirited personality represents her power. Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. She is Meygan's cousin.\n\n'''Sashabella Paws''' - (similar to [[Sasha (Bratz)|Sasha]]): Sashabella has the animal kingdom under her spell; she can communicate with creatures everywhere. Her favorite animal to talk to is her pet furball, Fluffinscruff. She loves mixing up faux fur with fuzzy boots. She also loves other fur clothing. Her witchmark is a tribal cat, and her color is light green. Her last name is a pun on the fact that her ability is \"animal chat\". Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. Sasha from ''Bratz'' is her cousin.\n\n'''Jade J'Adore''' - (similar to [[Jade (Bratz)|Jade]]): Jade loves everything about love. With her devilish pet love monster, Kissifuss, by her side, she has the power to heal a broken heart. She loves punky glam looks, luxurious lace, mysterious eyes and hearts on everything. She also loves urban witchy looks. Her witchmark is a heart arrow, and her color is red. Jade's surname is a pun on the [[French language|French]] word \"j'adore\" which can mean \"I love it\" or \"I adore it.\" Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. Her human cousin is Jade.\n\n====Other Bratzillaz====\nThe minor characters who can also be called \"Bratzillaz\" also consist of witches with surnames based on their powers. The only one who is not a witch is Vampelina, being a [[vampire]]ss, or at least being a vampiric witch. Their abilities are linked in their names. While Vampelina can see in the dark because she is a vampire, the other minor Bratzillaz have abilities that only a solid witch would have. Fianna is a \"sea witch\": similar to a [[mermaid]] but is not exactly a mermaid. Vampelina was shown to be a friend of [[#Jade J'Adore|Jade]] in \"Midnight Beach\". All of them have personalities that match up with their abilities and their surnames.\n\n'''Fianna Fins''' - (similar to [[List of Bratz characters#Fianna|Fianna]]): Fianna is a sea witch who has the power to control weather. Her pet is Ripple. Her witchmark is a mermaid tail. Introduced in the Winter/Spring 2013 Midnight Beach line. Her human cousin is Fianna.\n\n'''Vampelina''' - Vampelina is a vampiress who has the power to see in the dark. Her pet is Batric. Her witchmark is a pair of fangs. Introduced in the Winter/Spring 2013 Magic Night Out line.\n\n'''Victoria Antique''' - Victoria is an exchange student from China who has the power to turn old things back to new. Being from the country of China may or may not be a nod to her ability to fix old things, since some people in real life collect a substance called \"china\", which people use for many years as a decoration. Her witchmark is a snake. Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2013 Back to Magic line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.target.com/p/bratzillaz-back-to-magic-victoria-antique-china-doll/-/A-14592147#prodSlot=medium_1_1&term=bratzillaz%20victoria%20antique|title=Target : Expect More.

In August, MGA released the first Bratzillaz webisode to the official website and YouTube channel. A second webisode was released weeks later on September 11, 2012. The first season aired until January 4, 2013. A second season was expected to be released due to a leaked unreleased webisode titled \"Fashion Bites\" and parts of it being featured at the end of \"Midnight Beach\" when Yasmina looks into the future. However, due to MGA taking a hiatus with the Bratz line in 2014 to rebuild the brand, production of the dolls ended and a second season was never completed.\n\nFrom June 24, 2013 to July 22, 2013, there was a short series of videos about the Witchy Princesses titled \"Witchy Princesses Adventure\" which was not considered part of the webisode series.\n\n{{Episode table |background=#C276EC |overall= |title= |airdate= |viewers= |country=US|released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 1\n|Title= Welcome To Bratzillaz Academy!\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|8|15}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz first arrive at the Bratzillaz Academy, meet Headmistress Magika, and are given capes that give them their own special powers.\n|Viewers=1.88\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 2\n|Title= Furry Frenzy\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|9|11}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz meet Levitor and are each given their own pet.\n|Viewers=0.96\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 3\n|Title= Double Trouble\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|9|25}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz meet the Toola Twins and prepare to head off to their first class, Purses and Potions.\n|Viewers=1.01\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 4\n|Title= Pur-Fecting Boy Chat\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|10|9}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz help prepare Sashabella Paws for her first video chat with her crush, Igneus, as she is very nervous.\n|Viewers=0.61\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 5\n|Title= The Rrr-runway\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|10|24}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz pets star in their very own fashion show after they feel left out of seeing the Bratzillaz have one.\n|Viewers=0.76\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 6\n|Title= In the Big Screen\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|11|7}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz sneak into see Jade J'Adore's favorite movie, but ruin it for her and make it up by sending her into the movie.\n|Viewers=0.42\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 7\n|Title= Later, Alligator\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|11|20}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz have to magically create an Alligator purse in Purses and Potions, and quickly try to fix things when they go wrong.\n|Viewers=0.36\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 8\n|Title= Headlines and Deadlines\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2012|12|11}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz try to figure out how the Toola Twins always seem to beat Levitor in submitting breaking news into the school paper.\n|Viewers=0.62\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 9\n|Title= Midnight Beach\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2013|1|4}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz are given help from Vampelina and Fianna Fins to find Cloetta Spelletta's pet, Barkthalameow, when they lose him at the Midnight Beach.\n|Viewers=1.25\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber= 10\n|Title= Fashion Bites ''(Unreleased)''\n|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|N/A}}\n|ShortSummary= The Bratzillaz have a competition at Gloomingdale's to see who can find the best purchase.\n|Viewers= N/A\n|LineColor=C276EC\n}}\n}}\n\n===Witchy Princesses Adventure===\n* '''\"Week One\"''' (June 24, 2013) The Bratzillaz seek for information about the Witchy Princesses after Sashabella hears the three birds of the three Princesses crying.\n* '''\"Week Two\"''' (July 1, 2013) The Bratzillaz seek to find a book about the Witchy Princesses, only to find it is missing pages.\n* '''\"Week Three\"''' (July 8, 2013) The Bratzillaz look for two of the pages in Caf\u00e9 Zap and in the Toola Twins' room.\n* '''\"Week Four\"''' (July 15, 2013) The Bratzillaz look for the third missing page to finally restore the book.\n* '''\"Week Five\"''' (July 22, 2013) The Bratzillaz repair the book to discover what happened to the Witchy Princesses.\n\n==Characters==\n===Bratzillaz=== \nThe Bratzillaz are the witch cousins of the Bratz, according to the ''Bratzillaz'' theme song. Also according to the song, it was revealed that all of the Bratzillaz found out their witchy identities at age 16. Yasmina Clairvoya is assumed to be the cousin of Yasmin, Cloetta Spelletta is Cloe's cousin; Meygana Broomstix is Meygan's cousin (Though Meygan was never the main character in the ''Bratz'' franchise); also Sashabella Paws is the Bratz' Sasha's cousin though Sashabella is nicknamed \"Sasha\", which is her human cousin's name, by Cloetta in the episode \"Pur-Fecting Boy Chat\". Also Jade J'Adore is the cousin of Jade, having the same first name as Jade, her cousin. The others are original characters with only Fianna being based on another Brat. Vampelina, Victoria Antique, Illiana Honestly, and Angelica Sound are all original characters. Each Bratzilla has a witch's birthmark known as a \"witchmark\".\n\nUnlike the original Bratz, the Bratzillaz all have revealed last names.\n\nNone of them are the cousins of the Bratz shown in the [[Bratz (TV series)|''Bratz'' television series]]: the franchise about a magazine; though the webisodes of ''Bratzillaz (House of Witchez)'' do have a pair of evil blond female twins.\n\n====Main Bratzillaz====\n'''Yasmina Clairvoya''' - (similar to [[Yasmin (Bratz)|Yasmin]]): Yasmina has the power to see the future. She loves vintage romantic looks, retro style and funky braided hair. With her spellbinding style and oddball pet, Winkers, she stands out as a unique individual. Her witchmark is an Egyptian eye, and her color is purple. She is very dedicated to ''always'' having good fashion, as in the web series for the webisode: \"Rrr-runway\", when Sashabella said: \"Exactly. Imagine how you would feel if you had ''no'' stylish clothes\", Yasmina responded with: \"Are you ''trying'' to give me nightmares?\" Yasmina's surname \"Clairvoya\" is a pun on the word \"clairvoyant\", referring to her witch power to predict the future. Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. She is the Bratz girl Yasmin's witch cousin.\n\n'''Cloetta Spelletta''' - (similar to [[Cloe (Bratz)|Cloe]]): Cloetta and her mixed up cat/dog pet, Barkthalameow, has the power to mutate people into anything they want. She adores two-tone fashions, over-the-knee boots, sparkly capes and hair that goes straight and curly. She loves looks in two-sided colors. Her witchmark is a moon & stars, and her colors are pink and black. She has [[heterochromia]]. Cloetta's family name \"Spelletta\" is a play on the word \"spell\" referring to her metamorphosis magic. Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. She is the Cloe Brat's cousin.\n\n'''Meygana Broomstix''' - (similar to [[List of Bratz characters#Meygan|Meygan]]): Meygana and her winged pet, Wingzy, not only have the power to fly, but also make dreams come true. She loves all shades of the blue sky, late night parties, cloud hopping, fluttery capes and helping people's wildest dreams take flight. She loves sporty supernatural looks. Her witchmark is a pair of wings, and her color is blue. Meygana's last name \"Broomstix\" refers to how in traditional witch folklore or stereotypes of witches float on a [[broom]]stick. The name is a reference to the term \"broomsticks\", which is also referring to her ability to \"make dreams take flight\". Even Meygana's ditzy and free-spirited personality represents her power. Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. She is Meygan's cousin.\n\n'''Sashabella Paws''' - (similar to [[Sasha (Bratz)|Sasha]]): Sashabella has the animal kingdom under her spell; she can communicate with creatures everywhere. Her favorite animal to talk to is her pet furball, Fluffinscruff. She loves mixing up faux fur with fuzzy boots. She also loves other fur clothing. Her witchmark is a tribal cat, and her color is light green. Her last name is a pun on the fact that her ability is \"animal chat\". Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. Sasha from ''Bratz'' is her cousin.\n\n'''Jade J'Adore''' - (similar to [[Jade (Bratz)|Jade]]): Jade loves everything about love. With her devilish pet love monster, Kissifuss, by her side, she has the power to heal a broken heart. She loves punky glam looks, luxurious lace, mysterious eyes and hearts on everything. She also loves urban witchy looks. Her witchmark is a heart arrow, and her color is red. Jade's surname is a pun on the [[French language|French]] word \"j'adore\" which can mean \"I love it\" or \"I adore it.\" Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2012 First Edition basic line as one of the core five girls. Her human cousin is Jade.\n\n====Other Bratzillaz====\nThe minor characters who can also be called \"Bratzillaz\" also consist of witches with surnames based on their powers. The only one who is not a witch is Vampelina, being a [[vampire]]ss, or at least being a vampiric witch. Their abilities are linked in their names. While Vampelina can see in the dark because she is a vampire, the other minor Bratzillaz have abilities that only a solid witch would have. Fianna is a \"sea witch\": similar to a [[mermaid]] but is not exactly a mermaid. Vampelina was shown to be a friend of [[#Jade J'Adore|Jade]] in \"Midnight Beach\". All of them have personalities that match up with their abilities and their surnames. \n\n'''Fianna Fins''' - (similar to [[List of Bratz characters#Fianna|Fianna]]): Fianna is a sea witch who has the power to control weather. Her pet is Ripple. Her witchmark is a mermaid tail. Introduced in the Winter/Spring 2013 Midnight Beach line. Her human cousin is Fianna.\n\n'''Vampelina''' - Vampelina is a vampiress who has the power to see in the dark. Her pet is Batric. Her witchmark is a pair of fangs. Introduced in the Winter/Spring 2013 Magic Night Out line.\n\n'''Victoria Antique''' - Victoria is an exchange student from China who has the power to turn old things back to new. Being from the country of China may or may not be a nod to her ability to fix old things, since some people in real life collect a substance called \"china\", which people use for many years as a decoration. Her witchmark is a snake. Introduced in the Summer/Fall 2013 Back to Magic line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.target.com/p/bratzillaz-back-to-magic-victoria-antique-china-doll/-/A-14592147#prodSlot=medium_1_1&term=bratzillaz%20victoria%20antique|title=Target : Expect More.

However, their Bratz counterparts, Yasmin and Cloe, are the two most produced Bratz dolls.\n* Despite the fact, that the 2013 commercials only says \"House Of Witchez\" in them, the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjTgacgg14U UK versions] of both commercials also say \"Bratzillaz\" in some places.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{MGA Entertainment}}\n{{Bratz}}\n\n[[Category:Products introduced in 2012]]\n[[Category:Bratz]]\n[[Category:Fashion dolls]]\n[[Category:MGA Entertainment brands]]\n[[Category:2010s toys]]\n[[Category:Magical girl television series]]\n[[Category:Magical girl characters]]\n", "name_user": "Nealbo", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: well-known \u2192 well known", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratzillaz_(House_of_Witchez)"}

Today, it is often mentioned among the greatest heavy metal records ever. In their 2017 listing of the 100 Greatest Metal albums of all time, Rolling Stone magazine ranked \"Reign in Blood\" at #6. <ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-113614/slayer-reign-in-blood-1986-195925/</ref>.Alongside [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]'s ''[[Among the Living]]'', [[Megadeth]]'s ''[[Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?]]'', and [[Metallica]]'s ''[[Master of Puppets]]'', ''Reign in Blood'' helped define the sound of the emerging US thrash metal scene in the mid-1980s, and has remained influential since. The album was Slayer's first to enter the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at number 94, and was certified Gold on November 20, 1992.\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the positive reception Slayer's previous release ''[[Hell Awaits]]'' had received, the band's producer and manager [[Brian Slagel]] realized the band were in a position to hit the \"big time\" with their next album. Slagel negotiated with several record labels, among them [[Rick Rubin]] and [[Russell Simmons]]'s Def Jam Recordings. However, Slagel was reluctant to have the band signed to what was at the time primarily a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] label. Slayer drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] was made aware of Rubin's interest, and he initiated contact with the producer. However, Slayer's remaining members were apprehensive of leaving [[Metal Blade Records]], with which they were already under [[contract]].<ref name=\"An exclusive oral history of Slayer\"/>\n\nLombardo contacted [[Columbia Records]], which was Def Jam's [[distribution (business)|distributor]], and managed to get in touch with Rubin, who along with photographer [[Glen E. Friedman]] agreed to attend one of the band's concerts. Friedman had produced [[Suicidal Tendencies]]'s [[Suicidal Tendencies (album)|self-titled debut album]], in which Slayer vocalist [[Tom Araya]] made a guest appearance in the music video for the album's single \"[[Institutionalized (song)|Institutionalized]]\", pushing Suicidal Tendencies's vocalist [[Mike Muir]]. Around this time, Rubin asked Friedman if he knew Slayer.<ref name=\"An exclusive oral history of Slayer\"/>\n\nGuitarist [[Jeff Hanneman]] was surprised by Rubin's interest in the band, and was impressed by his work with the hip hop acts [[Run DMC]] and [[LL Cool J]]. During a visit by Slagel to a European music [[convention (meeting)|convention]], Rubin spoke with the band directly, and persuaded them to sign with Def Jam. Slagel paid a personal tribute to Rubin, and said that Rubin was the most passionate of all the label representatives the band were in negotiations with.

Today, it is often mentioned among the greatest heavy metal records ever. In their 2017 listing of the 100 Greatest Metal albums of all time, Rolling Stone magazine ranked \"Reign in Blood\" at #6. <ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-113614/slayer-reign-in-blood-1986-195925/</ref>.Alongside [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]'s ''[[Among the Living]]'', [[Megadeth]]'s ''[[Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?]]'', and [[Metallica]]'s ''[[Master of Puppets]]'', ''Reign in Blood'' helped define the sound of the emerging US thrash metal scene in the mid-1980s, and has remained influential since. The album was Slayer's first to enter the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at number 94, and was certified Gold on November 20, 1992.\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the positive reception Slayer's previous release ''[[Hell Awaits]]'' had received, the band's producer and manager [[Brian Slagel]] realized the band were in a position to hit the \"big time\" with their next album. Slagel negotiated with several record labels, among them [[Rick Rubin]] and [[Russell Simmons]]'s Def Jam Recordings. However, Slagel was reluctant to have the band signed to what was at the time primarily a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] label. Slayer drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] was made aware of Rubin's interest, and he initiated contact with the producer. However, Slayer's remaining members were apprehensive of leaving [[Metal Blade Records]], with which they were already under [[contract]].<ref name=\"An exclusive oral history of Slayer\"/>\n\nLombardo contacted [[Columbia Records]], which was Def Jam's [[distribution (business)|distributor]], and managed to get in touch with Rubin, who along with photographer [[Glen E. Friedman]] agreed to attend one of the band's concerts. Friedman had produced [[Suicidal Tendencies]]'s [[Suicidal Tendencies (album)|self-titled debut album]], in which Slayer vocalist [[Tom Araya]] made a guest appearance in the music video for the album's single \"[[Institutionalized (song)|Institutionalized]]\", pushing Suicidal Tendencies's vocalist [[Mike Muir]]. Around this time, Rubin asked Friedman if he knew Slayer.<ref name=\"An exclusive oral history of Slayer\"/>\n\nGuitarist [[Jeff Hanneman]] was surprised by Rubin's interest in the band, and was impressed by his work with the hip hop acts [[Run DMC]] and [[LL Cool J]]. During a visit by Slagel to a European music [[convention (meeting)|convention]], Rubin spoke with the band directly, and persuaded them to sign with Def Jam. Slagel paid a personal tribute to Rubin, and said that Rubin was the most passionate of all the label representatives the band were in negotiations with. Following the agreement, Friedman brought the band members to [[Seattle]] for two days of publicity shots, possible record shots, and photos for a tour book; Rubin felt no good photos of the band had been taken before that point. One of the photos was used on the back cover of the band's 1988 release ''[[South of Heaven]]''.<ref name=\"An exclusive oral history of Slayer\"/>\n\nThe cover artwork was designed by [[Larry Carroll (artist)|Larry Carroll]], who at the time was creating political illustrations for ''[[The Progressive]]'', ''[[Village Voice]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''.

To keep up with his studies, he began taking classes at [[Palm Beach State College|Palm Beach Junior College]] (PBJC) in neighboring [[Lake Park, Florida|Lake Park]].\n\n===Early acting===\nIn his first term at PBJC, he was in an English class taught by [[Watson B. Duncan III]]. Duncan pushed him into trying out for a play he was producing, ''[[Outward Bound (play)|Outward Bound]]''. He cast him in the lead role based on having heard him read Shakespeare in class, leading to his winning the 1956 Florida State Drama Award for his performance. \"I read two words and they gave me a lead,\" he later said.<ref name=\"macho\">BURT REYNOLDS: GOING BEYOND MACHO\nCohen, Barney New York Times29 Mar 1981: A.18.</ref>\n\nIn his autobiography, he referred to Duncan as his mentor and the most influential person in his life.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 57\u201359.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Theatre===\n[[File:Burt Reynolds With Citrus Queen at Garnet and Gold Football Game.jpg|left|thumb|Reynolds with the Citrus Queen at Garnet and Gold Football Game, Florida State University, 1963]]\nThe Florida State Drama Award included a scholarship to the Hyde Park Playhouse, a [[summer stock theatre]], in [[Hyde Park, New York]]. Reynolds saw the opportunity as an agreeable alternative to more physically demanding summer jobs, but did not yet see acting as a possible career. While working there, Reynolds met [[Joanne Woodward]], who helped him find an agent.\n\n\"I don't think I ever actually saw him perform,\" said Woodward later. \"I knew him as this cute, shy, attractive boy. He had the kind of lovely personality that made you want to do something for him.\"<ref name=\"macho\"/>\n\n[[File:Burt Reynolds 1991 portrait crop.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Reynolds in 1991]]\nHe was cast in ''[[Tea and Sympathy (play)|Tea and Sympathy]]'' at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre|Neighborhood Playhouse]] in [[New York City]]. After his Broadway debut in ''Look, We've Come Through'', he received favorable reviews for his performance and went on tour with the cast, driving the bus as well as appearing on stage.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 59\u201363.</ref>\n\nAfter the tour, Reynolds returned to New York and enrolled in acting classes, along with [[Frank Gifford]], [[Carol Lawrence]], [[Red Buttons]] and [[Jan Murray]].\n\n\"I was a working actor for two years before I finally took my first real acting class (with Wynn Handman at the Neighborhood Playhouse),\" he said. \"It was a lot of technique, truth, moment-to-moment, how to listen, improv.\"<ref name=\"macho\"/>\n\nAfter a botched improvisation in acting class, Reynolds briefly considered returning to Florida, but soon gained a part in a revival of ''[[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]]'', in which [[Charlton Heston]] played the starring role.\n\nAfter the play closed, the director, [[John Forsythe]], arranged a film audition with [[Joshua Logan]] for Reynolds. The film was ''[[Sayonara]]'' (1957). Reynolds was told he could not be in the film because he looked too much like [[Marlon Brando]]. Logan advised Reynolds to go to [[Hollywood]], although Reynolds did not feel confident enough to do so.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 63\u201365.</ref> (Another source says Reynolds did a screen test after [[Lew Wasserman]] saw the effect he had on secretaries in his office but the test was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"river\">Riverboat Set to Sink Maverick\nWolters, Larry.

He would stay on that list until 1984.\n\nHe made a sports comedy with [[Robert Aldrich]], ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]'' (1974) which was popular.

He played a jewel thief in ''[[Rough Cut (1980 film)|Rough Cut]]'' (1980) produced by Merrick, who fired and then rehired director [[Don Siegel]] during filming.\n\nReynolds had two huge hits with car films directed by Needham, ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' (1981). He starred in [[David Steinberg]]'s film ''[[Paternity (film)|Paternity]]'' (1981) and directed himself in a tough action film, ''[[Sharky's Machine]]'' (1981).\n\nReynolds wanted to try a musical again and so agreed to do ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982). It was box-office hit, as was ''[[Best Friends (1982 film)|Best Friends]]'' (1982) with [[Goldie Hawn]]. In 1982, Reynolds was voted the most popular star in the US for the fifth year in a row.\n\nAround this time he reflected:\n<blockquote>The only thing I really enjoy is this business, and I think my audience knows that. I've never been able to figure out exactly who that audience is. I know there have been a few pictures even my mother didn't go see, but there's always been an audience for them. I guess it is because they always know that I give it 100 percent, and good or bad, there's going to be quite a lot of me in that picture. That's what they're looking for.

Brooks]] offered Reynolds the role of astronaut Garrett Breedlove in ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'' (1983) but he turned it down to do ''[[Stroker Ace]]'' (1983), another car chase comedy directed by Needham. The ''Endearment'' role went to [[Jack Nicholson]], who went on to win an [[Academy Award]]. Reynolds said he made this decision because \"I felt I owed Hal more than I owed [[James L.

Reynolds felt this was a turning point in his career from which he never recovered. \"That's where I lost them,\" he says of his fans.<ref name=\"los\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-04/entertainment/ca-1803_1_burt-reynolds|title=Burt Reynolds is the Comeback Kid|last=Modderno|first=Craig|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|location=Los Angeles, Calif|date=January 4, 1987|page=L6|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}]</ref>\n\n''[[The Man Who Loved Women (1983 film)|The Man Who Loved Women]]'' (1983), directed by [[Blake Edwards]] also flopped.  In an interview around this time he said:\n<blockquote>Getting to the top has turned out to be a hell of a lot more fun than staying there. I've got [[Tom Selleck]] crawling up my back. I'm in my late 40s. I realize I have four or five more years where I can play certain kinds of parts and get away with it. That's why I'm leaning more and more toward directing and producing. I don't want to be stumbling around town doing [[Gabby Hayes]] parts a few years from now. I'd like to pick and choose and maybe go work for a perfume factory like Mr. [[Cary Grant]], and look wonderful with everybody saying, 'Gee, I wish he hadn't retired.<ref name=\"way\"/></blockquote>\n''[[Cannonball Run II]]'' (1984), directed by Needham, brought in some money but only half of the original. ''[[City Heat]]'' (1984), which teamed Reynolds and Eastwood was mildly popular but was considered a major critical and box office disappointment. He was injured during filming, causing him to lose weight and for rumors to begin that he had AIDS.<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nReynolds returned to directing with ''[[Stick (film)|Stick]]'' (1985) from an [[Elmore Leonard]] novel but it was both a critical and commercial failure. So too were three other action films he made: ''[[Heat (1986 film)|Heat]]'' (1986), based on a [[William Goldman]] novel, ''[[Malone (film)|Malone]]'' (1987), and ''[[Rent-a-Cop]]'' (1987) with Liza Minnelli.<ref name=\"los\"/> He later said he did ''Heat'' and ''Malone'' \"because there were so many rumors about me [about AIDS]. I had to get out and be seen.\"<ref name=\"rap\"/>\n\nReynolds attempted a screwball comedy, ''[[Switching Channels]]'' (1989), but it too was a box office disappointment. Even more poorly received was ''[[Physical Evidence]]'' (1989), directed by [[Michael Crichton]]. Reynolds received excellent reviews for the caper comedy ''[[Breaking In (1989 film)|Breaking In]]'' (1989), but the commercial reception was poor.<ref name=\"sayles\">Gerry Molyneaux, \"John Sayles'', Renaissance Books, 2000 p 182</ref>\n\n\"When I was doing very well,\" he said at the time, \"I wasn't conscious I was doing very well, but I became very conscious when I wasn't doing very well.

It ran two seasons, during which time Reynolds played a supporting part in ''[[Modern Love (1990 film)|Modern Love]]'' (1990).\n\nReynolds then starred in a sitcom, ''[[Evening Shade]]'' (1990\u201394) as Woodward \"Wood\" Newton.

However, he gradually moved into being more of a character actor - he had key support roles in ''[[Citizen Ruth]]'' (1996), an early work from [[Alexander Payne]], and ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'' (1996) with [[Demi Moore]]. He had to audition for the latter. The film's producer later said, \"To be honest, we were not enthusiastic at first.

To keep up with his studies, he began taking classes at [[Palm Beach State College|Palm Beach Junior College]] (PBJC) in neighboring [[Lake Park, Florida|Lake Park]].\n\n===Early acting===\nIn his first term at PBJC, he was in an English class taught by [[Watson B. Duncan III]]. Duncan pushed him into trying out for a play he was producing, ''[[Outward Bound (play)|Outward Bound]]''. He cast him in the lead role based on having heard him read Shakespeare in class, leading to his winning the 1956 Florida State Drama Award for his performance. \"I read two words and they gave me a lead,\" he later said.<ref name=\"macho\">BURT REYNOLDS: GOING BEYOND MACHO\nCohen, Barney New York Times29 Mar 1981: A.18.</ref>\n\nIn his autobiography, he referred to Duncan as his mentor and the most influential person in his life.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 57\u201359.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Theatre===\n[[File:Burt Reynolds With Citrus Queen at Garnet and Gold Football Game.jpg|left|thumb|Reynolds with the Citrus Queen at Garnet and Gold Football Game, Florida State University, 1963]]\nThe Florida State Drama Award included a scholarship to the Hyde Park Playhouse, a [[summer stock theatre]], in [[Hyde Park, New York]]. Reynolds saw the opportunity as an agreeable alternative to more physically demanding summer jobs, but did not yet see acting as a possible career. While working there, Reynolds met [[Joanne Woodward]], who helped him find an agent.\n\n\"I don't think I ever actually saw him perform,\" said Woodward later. \"I knew him as this cute, shy, attractive boy. He had the kind of lovely personality that made you want to do something for him.\"<ref name=\"macho\"/>\n\n[[File:Burt Reynolds 1991 portrait crop.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Reynolds in 1991]]\nHe was cast in ''[[Tea and Sympathy (play)|Tea and Sympathy]]'' at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre|Neighborhood Playhouse]] in [[New York City]]. After his Broadway debut in ''Look, We've Come Through'', he received favorable reviews for his performance and went on tour with the cast, driving the bus as well as appearing on stage.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 59\u201363.</ref>\n\nAfter the tour, Reynolds returned to New York and enrolled in acting classes, along with [[Frank Gifford]], [[Carol Lawrence]], [[Red Buttons]] and [[Jan Murray]].\n\n\"I was a working actor for two years before I finally took my first real acting class (with Wynn Handman at the Neighborhood Playhouse),\" he said. \"It was a lot of technique, truth, moment-to-moment, how to listen, improv.\"<ref name=\"macho\"/>\n\nAfter a botched improvisation in acting class, Reynolds briefly considered returning to Florida, but soon gained a part in a revival of ''[[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]]'', in which [[Charlton Heston]] played the starring role.\n\nAfter the play closed, the director, [[John Forsythe]], arranged a film audition with [[Joshua Logan]] for Reynolds. The film was ''[[Sayonara]]'' (1957). Reynolds was told he could not be in the film because he looked too much like [[Marlon Brando]]. Logan advised Reynolds to go to [[Hollywood]], although Reynolds did not feel confident enough to do so.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 63\u201365.</ref> (Another source says Reynolds did a screen test after [[Lew Wasserman]] saw the effect he had on secretaries in his office but the test was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"river\">Riverboat Set to Sink Maverick\nWolters, Larry.

At the end of 1973 Reynolds was voted into the list of the ten most popular box office stars in the US, at number four. He would stay on that list until 1984.\n\nHe made a sports comedy with [[Robert Aldrich]], ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]'' (1974) which was popular.

He played a jewel thief in ''[[Rough Cut (1980 film)|Rough Cut]]'' (1980) produced by Merrick, who fired and then rehired director [[Don Siegel]] during filming.\n\nReynolds had two huge hits with car films directed by Needham, ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' (1981). He starred in [[David Steinberg]]'s film ''[[Paternity (film)|Paternity]]'' (1981) and directed himself in a tough action film, ''[[Sharky's Machine]]'' (1981).\n\nReynolds wanted to try a musical again and so agreed to do ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982). It was box-office hit, as was ''[[Best Friends (1982 film)|Best Friends]]'' (1982) with [[Goldie Hawn]]. In 1982, Reynolds was voted the most popular star in the US for the fifth year in a row.\n\nAround this time he reflected:\n<blockquote>The only thing I really enjoy is this business, and I think my audience knows that. I've never been able to figure out exactly who that audience is. I know there have been a few pictures even my mother didn't go see, but there's always been an audience for them. I guess it is because they always know that I give it 100 percent, and good or bad, there's going to be quite a lot of me in that picture. That's what they're looking for.

The ''Endearment'' role went to [[Jack Nicholson]], who went on to win an [[Academy Award]]. Reynolds said he made this decision because \"I felt I owed Hal more than I owed [[James L.

Reynolds felt this was a turning point in his career from which he never recovered. \"That's where I lost them,\" he says of his fans.<ref name=\"los\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-04/entertainment/ca-1803_1_burt-reynolds|title=Burt Reynolds is the Comeback Kid|last=Modderno|first=Craig|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|location=Los Angeles, Calif|date=January 4, 1987|page=L6|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}]</ref>\n\n''[[The Man Who Loved Women (1983 film)|The Man Who Loved Women]]'' (1983), directed by [[Blake Edwards]] also flopped.  In an interview around this time he said:\n<blockquote>Getting to the top has turned out to be a hell of a lot more fun than staying there. I've got [[Tom Selleck]] crawling up my back. I'm in my late 40s. I realize I have four or five more years where I can play certain kinds of parts and get away with it. That's why I'm leaning more and more toward directing and producing. I don't want to be stumbling around town doing [[Gabby Hayes]] parts a few years from now.

''[[City Heat]]'' (1984), which teamed Reynolds and Eastwood was mildly popular but was considered a major critical and box office disappointment. He was injured during filming, causing him to lose weight and for rumors to begin that he had AIDS.<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nReynolds returned to directing with ''[[Stick (film)|Stick]]'' (1985) from an [[Elmore Leonard]] novel but it was both a critical and commercial failure. So too were three other action films he made: ''[[Heat (1986 film)|Heat]]'' (1986), based on a [[William Goldman]] novel, ''[[Malone (film)|Malone]]'' (1987), and ''[[Rent-a-Cop]]'' (1987) with Liza Minnelli.<ref name=\"los\"/> He later said he did ''Heat'' and ''Malone'' \"because there were so many rumors about me [about AIDS]. I had to get out and be seen.\"<ref name=\"rap\"/>\n\nReynolds attempted a screwball comedy, ''[[Switching Channels]]'' (1989), but it too was a box office disappointment. Even more poorly received was ''[[Physical Evidence]]'' (1989), directed by [[Michael Crichton]]. Reynolds received excellent reviews for the caper comedy ''[[Breaking In (1989 film)|Breaking In]]'' (1989), but the commercial reception was poor.<ref name=\"sayles\">Gerry Molyneaux, \"John Sayles'', Renaissance Books, 2000 p 182</ref>\n\n\"When I was doing very well,\" he said at the time, \"I wasn't conscious I was doing very well, but I became very conscious when I wasn't doing very well.

The Daleks were conceived by science-fiction writer [[Terry Nation]] and first appeared in the 1963 ''Doctor Who'' serial ''[[The Daleks]]'', in the shells designed by [[Raymond Cusick]].\n\nDrawing inspiration from the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s, Nation portrayed the Daleks as violent, merciless and pitiless cyborg aliens, who demand total conformity to their will,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2015/doctor-who-50-things-you-didnt-know/ |title=The Daleks were based on the Nazis... |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226224555/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2015/doctor-who-50-things-you-didnt-know/ |archive-date=26 February 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> and who are bent on the conquest of the universe and the [[Genocide|extermination]] of what they see as inferior races.\n\nIn the programme's narrative the Daleks were engineered by the scientist [[Davros]] during the final years of a thousand-year war between his people, the Kaleds, and their enemies the [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thal]]s. With some Kaleds already badly mutated and damaged by [[nuclear war]], Davros genetically modified the Kaleds and integrated them with a [[tank]]-like [[robot]]ic shell, removing their every emotion apart from hate. His creations soon came to view themselves as the supreme race in the universe, intent on purging the universe of all non-Dalek life. Collectively they are the greatest enemies of ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s protagonist, the [[Time Lord]] known as \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". Later in the programme's run the Daleks acquired [[time travel in fiction|time travel technology]] and engaged the Time Lords in a brutal [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] affecting most of the universe, with battles taking place across the whole of history.\n\nThe Daleks are the show's most popular and famous villains and their returns to the series over the decades have gained media attention.

[[John Scott Martin]], a Dalek operator from the original series, said that Dalek operation was a challenge: \"You had to have about six hands: one to do the eyestalk, one to do the lights, one for the gun, another for the smoke canister underneath, yet another for the sink plunger. If you were related to an octopus then it helped.\"<ref name=\"Monsters_85\">Howe (1997), p. 85</ref>\n\nFor ''Doctor Who'''s 21st-century revival the Dalek casings retain the same overall shape and dimensional proportions of previous Daleks, although many details have been redesigned to give the Dalek a heavier and more solid look.<ref name=\"Tucker\">{{cite magazine |last=Arnopp |first=Jason |date=July 2005 |title=Tucker's Luck |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] Special Edition |publisher=[[Panini Comics]] |location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent|Royal Tunbridge Wells]], Kent |issue=11 |pages=62\u201370}}</ref> Changes include a larger, more pointed base; a glowing eyepiece; an all-over metallic-brass finish (specified by Davies); thicker, nailed strips on the \"neck\" section; a housing for the eyestalk pivot; and significantly larger dome lights.<ref name=\"Tucker\"/> The new prop made its on-screen debut in the 2005 episode \"Dalek\".<ref name=\"Tucker\"/> These Dalek casings use a short operator inside the housing while the 'head' and eyestalk are operated via remote control.

Early versions of the Daleks rolled on nylon [[Caster|castors]], propelled by the operator's feet. Although castors were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]], for ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed on the streets of London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature [[tricycle]]s with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base.<ref>Howe (1997), pp. 84\u201385</ref> The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and it was not possible to remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small parabolic dish was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on [[static electricity]] drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.<ref name=\"Monsters_85\"/>\n\nLater versions of the prop had more efficient wheels and were once again simply propelled by the seated operators' feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of camera shot. The difficulty of operating all the prop's parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky Dalek movements.<ref name=\"Monsters_85\"/> This problem has largely been eradicated with the advent of the \"new series\" version, as its remotely controlled dome and eyestalk allow the operator to concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.<ref>Russell (2006), p. 163</ref>\n\n====Voices====\nThe [[staccato]] delivery, harsh tone and rising inflection of the Dalek voice were initially developed by two voice actors, [[Peter Hawkins]] and [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]], who varied the pitch and speed of the lines according to the emotion needed. Their voices were further processed electronically by [[Brian Hodgson]] at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]]. The sound-processing devices used have varied over the decades. In 1963 Hodgson and his colleagues used equalisation to boost the mid-range of the actor's voice, then subjected it to [[ring modulation]] with a 30&nbsp;Hz [[sine wave]]. The distinctive harsh, grating vocal timbre this produced has remained the pattern for all Dalek voices since (with the exception of those in the 1985 serial ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', for which the director, [[Graeme Harper]], deliberately used less distortion).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |title=BBC \u2013 Doctor Who \u2013 Dalek Empire III [interview with Nicholas Briggs] |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2010 |work=BBC News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110052452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |archivedate=10 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nBesides Hawkins and Graham, other voice actors for the Daleks have included [[Roy Skelton]], who first voiced the Daleks in the 1967 story ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'' and provided voices for five additional Dalek serials including ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'',<ref name=Planet>''[[Planet of the Daleks]].''

This Dalek appeared to be the sole Dalek survivor of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] which had destroyed both the Daleks and the Time Lords.<ref name=\"Dalek (episode)\"/> A [[Emperor Dalek|Dalek Emperor]] returned at the end of the 2005 series, having rebuilt the Dalek race with genetic material harvested from human subjects. It saw itself as a god, and the new Daleks were shown worshipping it. These Daleks and their fleet were destroyed in \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\".<ref name=Parting/> The 2006 season finale \"[[Army of Ghosts]]\"/\"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\" featured a squad of four Dalek survivors from the old Empire, known as the [[Cult of Skaro]], led by a black Dalek known as \"[[Dalek Sec|Sec]]\", that had survived the Time War by escaping into the Void between dimensions. They emerged, along with the Genesis Ark, a Time Lord prison vessel containing millions of Daleks, at Canary Wharf due to the actions of the [[Torchwood Institute]] and [[Cyberman#Revived series|Cybermen from a parallel world]]. This resulted in a Cyberman-Dalek clash in London, which was resolved when the [[Tenth Doctor]] caused both groups to be sucked back into the Void. The Cult survived by utilising an \"emergency temporal shift\" to escape.<ref name=Doomsday/><ref name=\"army\">{{cite episode | title = [[Army of Ghosts]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = Cardiff | airdate = 1 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nThese four Daleks - Sec, Jast, Thay and Caan - returned in the two-part story \"[[Daleks in Manhattan]]\"/\"[[Evolution of the Daleks]]\", in which whilst stranded in 1930s New York, they set up a base in the partially built [[Empire State Building]] and attempt to rebuild the Dalek race. To this end, Dalek Sec merges with a human being to become a Human/Dalek hybrid.

This angers the rest of the Cult, resulting in mutiny and the death of Sec, Thay and Jast as well as the wiping out of all the hybrids. This leaves Dalek Caan as the last Dalek in existence. When the Doctor makes Caan realise that he is the last of his kind, Caan uses emergency temporal shift and escapes once more.<ref name=Evolution/>\n\nThe Daleks returned in the 2008 season's two-part finale, \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\"/\"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", accompanied once again by their creator Davros. The story reveals that Caan's temporal shift sent him into the Time War whence he rescued Davros, in the process gaining the ability to see the future at the cost of his own sanity. Davros has created a new race using his own body's cells. The episode depicts a Dalek invasion of Earth, which with other planets is taken to the Medusa Cascade, led by a red Supreme Dalek, who has kept Caan and Davros imprisoned in \"The Vault\", a section of the Dalek flagship, the ''Crucible''. Davros and the Daleks plan to destroy reality itself with a \"reality bomb\" for which they need the stolen planets. The plan fails due to the interference of [[Donna Noble]], a companion of the Doctor, and Caan himself, who has been manipulating events to destroy the Daleks after realising the severity of the atrocities they have committed.<ref name=Stolen>{{cite episode | title = [[The Stolen Earth]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 28 June 2008}}</ref><ref name=Journey>{{cite episode | title = [[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 5 July 2008}}</ref> The Daleks returned in the 2010 episode \"[[Victory of the Daleks]]\", the third episode of the series; Daleks who escaped the destruction of Davros' empire fell back in time and, by chance, managed to retrieve the \"Progenitor\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/qe/crop/946x532/doctorwho/episodes/d11/s01/e03/art/d11s01e03_dalek_art_14.jpg |publisher=BBC |title=BBC concept artwork for Dalek Progenator |last=McKinstry |first=Peter |access-date=23 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224205734/http://static.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/qe/crop/946x532//doctorwho/episodes/d11/s01/e03/art/d11s01e03_dalek_art_14.jpg |archive-date=24 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> This is a tiny apparatus which contains 'original' Dalek DNA.

All record of the Doctor is removed from their collective consciousness at the end of the episode. The Daleks then appear in the 50th Anniversary special \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", where they are seen being defeated in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. In \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", the Daleks are one of the races that travel to Trenzalore and besiege it for centuries to stop the Doctor from releasing the Time Lords. Due to converting Tasha Lem into a Dalek puppet, they regain knowledge of the Doctor. In the end, they are the only enemy left, the others having retreated or been destroyed and nearly kill the near-death Doctor before the Time Lords intervene and grant him a new regeneration cycle. The Doctor then uses his regeneration energy to obliterate the Daleks on the planet.\n\nThe [[Twelfth Doctor]]'s first encounter with the Daleks is in his second full episode, \"[[Into the Dalek]]\" (2014), where he encounters a damaged Dalek, which he names 'Rusty', aboard a human resistance ship. Left with the Doctor's love of the universe and his hatred of the Daleks, he spares its life; it assumes a mission to destroy other Daleks. In \"[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]\"/\"[[The Witch's Familiar]]\" (2015), the Doctor is summoned to Skaro where he learns Davros is alive, but dying, and has rebuilt the Dalek Empire. He escapes Davros' clutches by enlivening the decrepit Daleks of Skaro's sewers, who tear the empire apart, leaving behind the Master ([[Michelle Gomez]]), who accompanied him to Skaro. In \"[[The Pilot (Doctor Who)|The Pilot]]\" (2017), the Doctor briefly visits a battle in the Dalek-Movellan war while trying to escape a time travelling enemy.\n\nThe [[Thirteenth Doctor]] encountered a Dalek in a New Year's Day episode, \"[[Resolution (Doctor Who)|Resolution]]\" (2019). A Dalek mutant, separated from its armoured casing, takes control of a human in order to rebuild itself and summon more Daleks to conquer [[Earth]].\n\n{{Multiple images\n| align = center\n| footer = Evolution of the Daleks, variants of the props since 1963, on display at various exhibitions.\n| total_width = 800\n| image1    = Doctor Who Experience (5879255282).jpg\n| width1  =  1286 \n| height1 = 1801\n| image2 = 270811-048 CPS (6277340904).jpg\n| width2  = 3056\n| height2 = 4592\n| image3  = Renegade Dalek (10634715363).jpg\n| width3  = 1629\n| height3 = 3125\n| image4 = Icons of Science Fiction - Doctor Who (9444463245).jpg\n| width4  = 1528\n| height4 =  2816\n| image5  = Dalek (10634451635).jpg\n| width5  = 1946\n| height5 =  3709\n| image6 = Doctor Who Experience Cardiff - Rise and evolution of the Daleks (14418887997).jpg\n| width6  = 1405\n| height6 = 2150 \n}}\n\n==Dalek culture==\nDaleks have little, if any, individual personality,<ref name=Doomsday/> ostensibly no emotions other than hatred and anger,<ref name=\"Dalek (episode)\"/> and a strict command structure in which they are conditioned to obey superiors' orders without question.<ref name=Evil>''[[The Evil of the Daleks]].''

However, this was reversed in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", when the Daleks regained knowledge of the Doctor through the memory of an old acquaintance of the Doctor, Tasha Lem.\n\n=== Measurements ===\nA ''rel'' is a Dalek and Kaled unit of measurement. It was usually a measurement of [[time]], with a duration of slightly more than one second, as mentioned in \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\", \"[[Evolution of the Daleks]]\" and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", counting down to the ignition of the reality bomb. (One earth minute most likely equals about 50 ''rels''.) However, in some comic books it was also used as a unit of [[velocity]]. Finally, in some cases it was used as a unit of hydroelectric energy (not to be confused with a vep, the unit used to measure artificial sunlight).\n\nThe ''rel'' was first used in the non-canonical feature film ''[[Daleks \u2013 Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.]]'', soon after appearing in early Doctor Who comic books.\n\n==Licensed appearances==\n[[File:Dalek Chronicles 4.jpg|thumb|alt=A comics page with eleven panels.

The weekly one-page strip, written by Whitaker but credited to Nation, featured the Daleks as protagonists and \"heroes\", and continued for two years, from their creation of the mechanised Daleks by the humanoid Dalek scientist, Yarvelling, to their eventual discovery in the ruins of a crashed space-liner of the co-ordinates for [[Earth]], which they proposed to invade. Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television, some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the [[Dalek variants|Dalek Emperor]] did show up later on in the programme.<ref>Howe (1992), p. 143</ref>\n\nAt the same time, a ''Doctor Who'' strip was also being published in ''[[TV Comic]]''. Initially, the strip did not have the rights to use the Daleks, so the [[First Doctor]] battled the \"Trods\" instead, cone-shaped robotic creatures that ran on static electricity. By the time the [[Second Doctor]] appeared in the strip in 1967 the rights issues had been resolved, and the Daleks began making appearances starting in ''The Trodos Ambush'' (TVC #788-#791), where they massacred the Trods. The Daleks also made appearances in the [[Third Doctor]]-era ''Dr. Who'' comic strip that featured in the combined ''[[Countdown (comic)|Countdown]]/[[TV Action (comic)|TV Action]]'' comic during the

principally portrayed in the British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] programme ''[[Doctor Who]]''. The Daleks were conceived by science-fiction writer [[Terry Nation]] and first appeared in the 1963 ''Doctor Who'' serial ''[[The Daleks]]'', in the shells designed by [[Raymond Cusick]].\n\nDrawing inspiration from the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s, Nation portrayed the Daleks as violent, merciless and pitiless cyborg aliens, who demand total conformity to their will,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2015/doctor-who-50-things-you-didnt-know/ |title=The Daleks were based on the Nazis... |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226224555/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2015/doctor-who-50-things-you-didnt-know/ |archive-date=26 February 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> and who are bent on the conquest of the universe and the [[Genocide|extermination]] of what they see as inferior races.\n\nIn the programme's narrative the Daleks were engineered by the scientist [[Davros]] during the final years of a thousand-year war between his people, the Kaleds, and their enemies the [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thal]]s. With some Kaleds already badly mutated and damaged by [[nuclear war]], Davros genetically modified the Kaleds and integrated them with a [[tank]]-like [[robot]]ic shell, removing their every emotion apart from hate. His creations soon came to view themselves as the supreme race in the universe, intent on purging the universe of all non-Dalek life.

The Dalek cases were built in two pieces; an operator would step into the lower section and then the top would be secured. The operators looked out between the cylindrical louvres just beneath the dome, which were lined with mesh to conceal their faces.<ref name=\"Monsters-82\"/>\n\nIn addition to being hot and cramped, the Dalek casings also muffled external sounds, making it difficult for operators to hear the director or dialogue. [[John Scott Martin]], a Dalek operator from the original series, said that Dalek operation was a challenge: \"You had to have about six hands: one to do the eyestalk, one to do the lights, one for the gun, another for the smoke canister underneath, yet another for the sink plunger.

Early versions of the Daleks rolled on nylon [[Caster|castors]], propelled by the operator's feet. Although castors were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]], for ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed on the streets of London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature [[tricycle]]s with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base.<ref>Howe (1997), pp. 84\u201385</ref> The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and it was not possible to remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small parabolic dish was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on [[static electricity]] drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.<ref name=\"Monsters_85\"/>\n\nLater versions of the prop had more efficient wheels and were once again simply propelled by the seated operators' feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of camera shot. The difficulty of operating all the prop's parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky Dalek movements.<ref name=\"Monsters_85\"/> This problem has largely been eradicated with the advent of the \"new series\" version, as its remotely controlled dome and eyestalk allow the operator to concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.<ref>Russell (2006), p. 163</ref>\n\n====Voices====\nThe [[staccato]] delivery, harsh tone and rising inflection of the Dalek voice were initially developed by two voice actors, [[Peter Hawkins]] and [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]], who varied the pitch and speed of the lines according to the emotion needed. Their voices were further processed electronically by [[Brian Hodgson]] at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]]. The sound-processing devices used have varied over the decades. In 1963 Hodgson and his colleagues used equalisation to boost the mid-range of the actor's voice, then subjected it to [[ring modulation]] with a 30&nbsp;Hz [[sine wave]]. The distinctive harsh, grating vocal timbre this produced has remained the pattern for all Dalek voices since (with the exception of those in the 1985 serial ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', for which the director, [[Graeme Harper]], deliberately used less distortion).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |title=BBC \u2013 Doctor Who \u2013 Dalek Empire III [interview with Nicholas Briggs] |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2010 |work=BBC News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110052452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |archivedate=10 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nBesides Hawkins and Graham, other voice actors for the Daleks have included [[Roy Skelton]], who first voiced the Daleks in the 1967 story ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'' and provided voices for five additional Dalek serials including ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'',<ref name=Planet>''[[Planet of the Daleks]].''

All record of the Doctor is removed from their collective consciousness at the end of the episode. The Daleks then appear in the 50th Anniversary special \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", where they are seen being defeated in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. In \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", the Daleks are one of the races that travel to Trenzalore and besiege it for centuries to stop the Doctor from releasing the Time Lords. Due to converting Tasha Lem into a Dalek puppet, they regain knowledge of the Doctor. In the end, they are the only enemy left, the others having retreated or been destroyed and nearly kill the near-death Doctor before the Time Lords intervene and grant him a new regeneration cycle. The Doctor then uses his regeneration energy to obliterate the Daleks on the planet.\n\nThe [[Twelfth Doctor]]'s first encounter with the Daleks is in his second full episode, \"[[Into the Dalek]]\" (2014), where he encounters a damaged Dalek, which he names 'Rusty', aboard a human resistance ship. Left with the Doctor's love of the universe and his hatred of the Daleks, he spares its life; it assumes a mission to destroy other Daleks. In \"[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]\"/\"[[The Witch's Familiar]]\" (2015), the Doctor is summoned to Skaro where he learns Davros is alive, but dying, and has rebuilt the Dalek Empire. He escapes Davros' clutches by enlivening the decrepit Daleks of Skaro's sewers, who tear the empire apart, leaving behind the Master ([[Michelle Gomez]]), who accompanied him to Skaro. In \"[[The Pilot (Doctor Who)|The Pilot]]\" (2017), the Doctor briefly visits a battle in the Dalek-Movellan war while trying to escape a time travelling enemy.\n\nThe [[Thirteenth Doctor]] encountered a Dalek in a New Year's Day episode, \"[[Resolution (Doctor Who)|Resolution]]\" (2019). A Dalek mutant, separated from its armoured casing, takes control of a human in order to rebuild itself and summon more Daleks to conquer [[Earth]].\n\n{{Multiple images\n| align = center\n| footer = Evolution of the Daleks, variants of the props since 1963, on display at various exhibitions.\n| total_width = 800\n| image1    = Doctor Who Experience (5879255282).jpg\n| width1  =  1286 \n| height1 = 1801\n| image2 = 270811-048 CPS (6277340904).jpg\n| width2  = 3056\n| height2 = 4592\n| image3  = Renegade Dalek (10634715363).jpg\n| width3  = 1629\n| height3 = 3125\n| image4 = Icons of Science Fiction - Doctor Who (9444463245).jpg\n| width4  = 1528\n| height4 =  2816\n| image5  = Dalek (10634451635).jpg\n| width5  = 1946\n| height5 =  3709\n| image6 = Doctor Who Experience Cardiff - Rise and evolution of the Daleks (14418887997).jpg\n| width6  = 1405\n| height6 = 2150 \n}}\n\n==Dalek culture==\nDaleks have little, if any, individual personality,<ref name=Doomsday/> ostensibly no emotions other than hatred and anger,<ref name=\"Dalek (episode)\"/> and a strict command structure in which they are conditioned to obey superiors' orders without question.<ref name=Evil>''[[The Evil of the Daleks]].''

Season 5, episode 3.</ref>\n\nBecause the Doctor has defeated the Daleks so often, he has become their collective [[Archenemy|arch-enemy]] and they have standing orders to capture or exterminate him on sight. In later fiction, the Daleks know the Doctor as ''\"Ka Faraq Gatri\"'' (\"Bringer of Darkness\" or \"Destroyer of Worlds\"), and \"The Oncoming Storm\".<ref name=Parting/><ref name=\"Journey\"/> Both the [[Ninth Doctor]] ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) and [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]) suggest that the Doctor is one of the few beings the Daleks fear. In \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\", Rose notes that while the Daleks see the extermination of five million [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] as \"pest control\", \"one Doctor\" visibly un-nerves them (to the point they physically recoil).<ref name=\"Doomsday\"/> To his indignant surprise, in \"Asylum of the Daleks\", the [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) learns that the Daleks have designated him as \"The Predator\".\n\nAs the Doctor escapes the Asylum (with companions Amy and Rory), a Dalek-converted-human (Oswin Oswald) prisoner provides critical assistance, which culminates in completely deleting the Doctor from the Dalek hive-consciousness (the PathWeb), thus wiping the slate entirely blank. However, this was reversed in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\", when the Daleks regained knowledge of the Doctor through the memory of an old acquaintance of the Doctor, Tasha Lem.\n\n=== Measurements ===\nA ''rel'' is a Dalek and Kaled unit of measurement. It was usually a measurement of [[time]], with a duration of slightly more than one second, as mentioned in \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\", \"[[Evolution of the Daleks]]\" and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", counting down to the ignition of the reality bomb. (One earth minute most likely equals about 50 ''rels''.) However, in some comic books it was also used as a unit of [[velocity]]. Finally, in some cases it was used as a unit of hydroelectric energy (not to be confused with a vep, the unit used to measure artificial sunlight).\n\nThe ''rel'' was first used in the non-canonical feature film ''[[Daleks \u2013 Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.]]'', soon after appearing in early Doctor Who comic books.\n\n==Licensed appearances==\n[[File:Dalek Chronicles 4.jpg|thumb|alt=A comics page with eleven panels. The first panel contains the title \"The Daleks\" in jagged white letters.

The movies were not direct remakes; for example, the Doctor in the Cushing films was a human inventor called \"Dr. Who\" who built a time-travelling device named ''Tardis'', instead of a mysterious alien who stole a device called \"the TARDIS\".<ref>Peel (1988), p. 96; Howe (1992), p. 129</ref>\n\nFour books focusing on the Daleks were published in the 1960s.

The weekly one-page strip, written by Whitaker but credited to Nation, featured the Daleks as protagonists and \"heroes\", and continued for two years, from their creation of the mechanised Daleks by the humanoid Dalek scientist, Yarvelling, to their eventual discovery in the ruins of a crashed space-liner of the co-ordinates for [[Earth]], which they proposed to invade. Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television, some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the [[Dalek variants|Dalek Emperor]] did show up later on in the programme.<ref>Howe (1992), p. 143</ref>\n\nAt the same time, a ''Doctor Who'' strip was also being published in ''[[TV Comic]]''. Initially, the strip did not have the rights to use the Daleks, so the [[First Doctor]] battled the \"Trods\" instead, cone-shaped robotic creatures that ran on static electricity. By the time the [[Second Doctor]] appeared in the strip in 1967 the rights issues had been resolved, and the Daleks began making appearances starting in ''The Trodos Ambush'' (TVC #788-#791), where they massacred the Trods. The Daleks also made appearances in the [[Third Doctor]]-era ''Dr. Who'' comic strip that featured in the combined ''[[Countdown (comic)|Countdown]]/[[TV Action (comic)|TV Action]]'' comic during the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/tvaction3.htm |title=Countdown / TV Action Strips and Stories featuring the Third Doctor |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last=Boies

He most notably played in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).\n\n== Playing career ==\nFleischmann originally played three years in his native Czech Republic as a junior with [[HC V\u00edtkovice Steel|HC Vitkovic]], playing at both the under-18 and under-20 levels. As a prolific scorer, Fleischmann experienced his first taste of professional hockey late in the 2002\u201303 season, appearing in eight games out on loan with third-division team HC [[Nov\u00fd Ji\u010d\u00edn]].\n\nFleischmann was subsequently drafted in the second round, 63rd overall, by the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the [[2002 NHL Entry Draft]]. With aspirations for an NHL career, Fleischmann immediately made the transition to North America by joining the [[Moose Jaw Warriors]] of the [[Western Hockey League]] (WHL) for the [[2002\u201303 WHL season|2002\u201303 season]]. In his first season, Fleischmann emerged as a leader on the offence for the Warriors, finishing with 71 points in 65 games. Helping Moose Jaw reach the second round of the post-season, he led the team with 11 assists and 15 points in 12 games.\n\nIn the [[2003\u201304 WHL season|2003\u201304 season]], Fleischmann improved his offensive numbers with Moose Jaw to post 30 goals and 75 points in 60 games and earn selection to the WHL East Second All-Star Team. During the campaign, on February 27, 2004, Fleischmann's NHL rights were traded with draft picks by the Red Wings to the [[Washington Capitals]] in exchange for fellow countryman [[Robert Lang (ice hockey)|Robert Lang]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Red Wings acquire Lang from Capitals|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2004-02-27-wings-caps-lang_x.htm|newspaper= [[USA Today]] | first=Joseph | last=White | date= 2004-02-28 | accessdate = 2010-12-14}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tomas Fleischmann14.jpg|thumb|Fleischmann as a member of the Capitals.]]\nOn June 1, 2006, Fleischmann was signed by the Capitals to a three-year, entry level contract.
