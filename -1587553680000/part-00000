The district extends inland to the top of the Tararua Range, whereas in the public perception the inland hill country is rarely considered as part of the coast.

Around this time, Europeans began whaling in the area, and on 16 October 1839, [[William Wakefield]] of the [[New Zealand Company]] arrived in the Kapiti region to purchase land for permanent European settlement.  Te Rauparaha sold him land in the [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and [[Golden Bay]] area.\n\nEuropean settlement of the Kapiti Coast only took place on a significant scale after the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company]] (WMR) opened its railway line from [[Wellington]] to [[Longburn]], just south of [[Palmerston North]]. The line was opened in 1886, with the final spike driven in on the Kapiti Coast at Otaihanga. Paek\u0101k\u0101riki was quickly established as a significant [[steam locomotive]] depot due to the need to swap locomotives at the location; powerful, heavy locomotives were required to handle trains over the rugged section from Wellington to Paek\u0101k\u0101riki, while lighter, faster locomotives were more suited to the relatively flat terrain north of Paek\u0101k\u0101riki.  In 1908, the WMR was purchased by the [[New Zealand Railways Department]], who incorporated the line into the [[North Island Main Trunk Railway]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kapitinow.co.nz/history/the-history-of-kapiti|title=The History of Kapiti|website=www.kapitinow.co.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1940, the Wellington-Paek\u0101k\u0101riki section was [[railway electrification system|electrified]] as [[electric locomotive]]s provided better motive power.  This meant trains would swap from steam (and later [[diesel locomotive|diesel-electric]]) to electric traction in Paek\u0101k\u0101riki and it retained its status as a significant locomotive depot.  It also became the northern terminus of the Wellington commuter railway network until 8 May 1983, when it was extended to Paraparaumu. In February 2011 electrification reached Waikanae, which became the new terminus.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], [[Queen Elizabeth Park, New Zealand|Queen Elizabeth Park]] \u2013 a large tract of parkland between Raumati South and Paek\u0101k\u0101riki \u2013 was the location of two [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] camps, McKay and Russell.  US troops were stationed at the camps in 1942\u201344 prior to being sent into combat in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Ocean theatre]].\n\nAfter World War II, Wellington's Rongotai Airport was closed due to safety reasons in 1947 and [[Kapiti Coast Airport]] became the main airport for the [[Wellington Region]]. In 1949, it was New Zealand's busiest airport and helped to stimulate growth on the Kapiti Coast.

The district extends inland to the top of the Tararua Range, whereas in the public perception the inland hill country is rarely considered as part of the coast.

Around this time, Europeans began whaling in the area, and on 16 October 1839, [[William Wakefield]] of the [[New Zealand Company]] arrived in the Kapiti region to purchase land for permanent European settlement.  Te Rauparaha sold him land in the [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and [[Golden Bay]] area.\n\nEuropean settlement of the Kapiti Coast only took place on a significant scale after the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company]] (WMR) opened its railway line from [[Wellington]] to [[Longburn]], just south of [[Palmerston North]]. The line was opened in 1886, with the final spike driven in on the Kapiti Coast at Otaihanga. Paek\u0101k\u0101riki was quickly established as a significant [[steam locomotive]] depot due to the need to swap locomotives at the location; powerful, heavy locomotives were required to handle trains over the rugged section from Wellington to Paek\u0101k\u0101riki, while lighter, faster locomotives were more suited to the relatively flat terrain north of Paek\u0101k\u0101riki.  In 1908, the WMR was purchased by the [[New Zealand Railways Department]], who incorporated the line into the [[North Island Main Trunk Railway]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kapitinow.co.nz/history/the-history-of-kapiti|title=The History of Kapiti|website=www.kapitinow.co.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1940, the Wellington-Paek\u0101k\u0101riki section was [[railway electrification system|electrified]] as [[electric locomotive]]s provided better motive power.  This meant trains would swap from steam (and later [[diesel locomotive|diesel-electric]]) to electric traction in Paek\u0101k\u0101riki and it retained its status as a significant locomotive depot.  It also became the northern terminus of the Wellington commuter railway network until 8 May 1983, when it was extended to Paraparaumu. In February 2011 electrification reached Waikanae, which became the new terminus.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], [[Queen Elizabeth Park, New Zealand|Queen Elizabeth Park]] \u2013 a large tract of parkland between Raumati South and Paek\u0101k\u0101riki \u2013 was the location of two [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] camps, McKay and Russell.  US troops were stationed at the camps in 1942\u201344 prior to being sent into combat in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Ocean theatre]].\n\nAfter World War II, Wellington's Rongotai Airport was closed due to safety reasons in 1947 and [[Kapiti Coast Airport]] became the main airport for the [[Wellington Region]]. In 1949, it was New Zealand's busiest airport and helped to stimulate growth on the Kapiti Coast.  The [[Wellington International Airport]] was opened in 1959 and Paraparaumu Airport never regained its status, with some of its land sold for residential development in the 1990s and 2000s. It is now used for minor commercial activity such as that of airline [[Air Chathams]], helicopter and light aircraft training and for private and hobby flights.\n\nRecently, the Kapiti Coast has seen a significant population surge and is one of New Zealand's fastest growing areas.

Together with its neighbouring settlement of Waikanae Beach, the town comprises a quiet locale, popular with families and retirees.  Just north of Waikanae is the small community of [[Peka Peka]].\n\nThe area surrounding the town is notable for its 5-kilometre long beach and its  wide river mouth opposite [[Kapiti Island]], which lies four kilometres offshore in the Tasman Sea. The Kapiti Island Nature Reserve includes the Waikanae Estuary Scientific Reserve. The [[Te Araroa Trail]] leads through Waikanae.\n\nThe waters between Waikanae Beach and Kapiti Island comprise the [[Kapiti Marine Reserve]], with whales and [[Hector's dolphin]]s sometimes spotted on their migration routes through the narrow corridor. Inland, behind Waikanae, are the bush clad Hemi Matenga Reserve, the Tararua Ranges and the [[Akatarawa Valley]], home to a popular conservation park, Staglands Wildlife Reserve.  A road through the valley over the Akatarawa Saddle provides a link with the [[Hutt Valley]] via [[Reikorangi]] and [[Cloustonville]]. The headwaters of the [[Waikanae River]] form where a number of streams converge in the inland Reikorangi Basin. From here the river runs through a gap in the foothills, across the coastal plain and sand dunes to the sea.\n\n[[Image:Waikanae River.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Waikanae River]]\n\nPrior to human settlement the Waikanae coastal plain comprised [[wetlands]] divided by a complex pattern of natural waterways and [[kohekohe]] wooded regions. Wetlands remain a diminishing feature of the region but the development of numerous private gardens has led to Waikanae having one of the highest levels of water consumption per head of population in New Zealand. The community draws its water from the single source of the Waikanae River, and seasonal shortages during the warmer months of the year constitute a growing problem for the area.<ref>\nChris MacLean and Joan Maclean, page 121 \"Waikanae\", {{ISBN|978-0-473-16597-0}}\n</ref>\n\n==Birdlife==\n\nWaikanae Beach is populated by [[terns]], [[seagulls]], [[oystercatchers]], and [[stilt]]s. Inland wetlands provide refuge for [[pukeko]], [[crake]] and [[New Zealand dabchick]]s. White fronted [[herons]], [[tui (bird)|tui]] and [[cormorant|shags]] range across the coastal plain.<ref>Chris Maclean and Joan Maclean, page 217, \"Waikanae\", {{ISBN|978-0-473-16597-0}}</ref> The ready availability of both birdlife and seafood encouraged early M\u0101ori settlement of the area. Introduced species such as ducks and black swans have also flourished over the last century.\n\n==Hemi Matenga Memorial Scenic Reserve==\n\nWaikanae is backed by the heavily forested 330-hectare Hemi Matenga Reserve covering a range overlooking the town itself. Rising to 514 metres above sea level, the forest comprises one of the most extensive areas of [[kohekohe]] woodland left in New Zealand. The reserve was named after its former owner; Hemi Matenga Waipunahau of the [[Ngati Toa]],<ref>N.Z. Department of Conservation publication \"Hemi Matenga Memorial Park Scenic Reserve\"</ref> following his death in 1912.

Together with its neighbouring settlement of Waikanae Beach, the town comprises a quiet locale, popular with families and retirees.  Just north of Waikanae is the small community of [[Peka Peka]].\n\nThe area surrounding the town is notable for its 5-kilometre long beach and its  wide river mouth opposite [[Kapiti Island]], which lies four kilometres offshore in the Tasman Sea. The Kapiti Island Nature Reserve includes the Waikanae Estuary Scientific Reserve. The [[Te Araroa Trail]] leads through Waikanae.\n\nThe waters between Waikanae Beach and Kapiti Island comprise the [[Kapiti Marine Reserve]], with whales and [[Hector's dolphin]]s sometimes spotted on their migration routes through the narrow corridor. Inland, behind Waikanae, are the bush clad Hemi Matenga Reserve, the Tararua Ranges and the [[Akatarawa Valley]], home to a popular conservation park, Staglands Wildlife Reserve.  A road through the valley over the Akatarawa Saddle provides a link with the [[Hutt Valley]] via [[Reikorangi]] and [[Cloustonville]]. The headwaters of the [[Waikanae River]] form where a number of streams converge in the inland Reikorangi Basin. From here the river runs through a gap in the foothills, across the coastal plain and sand dunes to the sea.\n\n[[Image:Waikanae River.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Waikanae River]]\n\nPrior to human settlement the Waikanae coastal plain comprised [[wetlands]] divided by a complex pattern of natural waterways and [[kohekohe]] wooded regions. Wetlands remain a diminishing feature of the region but the development of numerous private gardens has led to Waikanae having one of the highest levels of water consumption per head of population in New Zealand. The community draws its water from the single source of the Waikanae River, and seasonal shortages during the warmer months of the year constitute a growing problem for the area.<ref>\nChris MacLean and Joan Maclean, page 121 \"Waikanae\", {{ISBN|978-0-473-16597-0}}\n</ref>\n\n==Birdlife==\n\nWaikanae Beach is populated by [[terns]], [[seagulls]], [[oystercatchers]], and [[stilt]]s. Inland wetlands provide refuge for [[pukeko]], [[crake]] and [[New Zealand dabchick]]s. White fronted [[herons]], [[tui (bird)|tui]] and [[cormorant|shags]] range across the coastal plain.<ref>Chris Maclean and Joan Maclean, page 217, \"Waikanae\", {{ISBN|978-0-473-16597-0}}</ref> The ready availability of both birdlife and seafood encouraged early M\u0101ori settlement of the area. Introduced species such as ducks and black swans have also flourished over the last century.\n\n==Hemi Matenga Memorial Scenic Reserve==\n\nWaikanae is backed by the heavily forested 330-hectare Hemi Matenga Reserve covering a range overlooking the town itself. Rising to 514 metres above sea level, the forest comprises one of the most extensive areas of [[kohekohe]] woodland left in New Zealand. The reserve was named after its former owner; Hemi Matenga Waipunahau of the [[Ngati Toa]],<ref>N.Z.

All were delivered between 1954 and 1956.<ref>[http://www.railpage.com.au/locos/x-class-diesel-wa X Class (diesel, WA)] Railpage</ref>\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:XA1402, Forrestfield, 1987.JPG|left|upright|thumb|XA 1402 at [[Forrestfield, Western Australia|Forrestfield]] Yard in August 1987]]\nThe X class revolutionised operations on the WAGR. Their light axle load of around 12 tons meant they could travel on all lines, and the dual cab arrangement eliminated the need for turning. They were quickly allocated to express passenger trains including the ''[[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] Express'', ''[[Transwa Australind|Australind]]'', ''[[Kalgoorlie]] Express'' and ''[[The Westland]]''. Although considered as good runners, the eight driving wheels being attached to the rigid main frame caused these locomotives to ride roughly.\n\n==The Crossley engine==\nAt the time of construction, the HST-V8 was an untested concept, though the engine itself was an evolution of a design used successfully in patrol boats during World War Two<ref>Doncaster, N: The Crossley Experience''' \"The Partyline\"''' - the in-house magazine of Steamtown Peterborough. Number 71, Spring 1998</ref>. One line of thought is the motor was an evolution of either of the HRN8 marine diesel, or the HRP8 stationary diesel <ref name=puse>Pusenjak,N 2014 The WAGR X Class Locomotive; A look back with todays hindsight: The Westland: The Journal of Rail Heritage WA - Special Edition X Class 60th Anniversary, pp5-18</ref>.\n\nFailures commenced within weeks of the first locomotives being unveiled. It was only the skill of staff at WAGR's [[Midland Railway Workshops]] that saved the day. In their early days, availability was less than for steam.\n\nThe engines used Crossley's system of [[exhaust pulse pressure charging]] and developed 1,200 horsepower (895&nbsp;kW) at 625&nbsp;rpm, though in 1981 they were down-rated to 875&nbsp;hp at 600rpm. There were no valves, and inlet and exhaust were via ports in the cylinder walls.\n\nThe engines burnt and leaked oil, had underfed bearings, vibrated and popped heads and pistons, and suffered from ring scuffing for most of their lives.

All were delivered between 1954 and 1956.<ref>[http://www.railpage.com.au/locos/x-class-diesel-wa X Class (diesel, WA)] Railpage</ref>\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:XA1402, Forrestfield, 1987.JPG|left|upright|thumb|XA 1402 at [[Forrestfield, Western Australia|Forrestfield]] Yard in August 1987]]\nThe X class revolutionised operations on the WAGR. Their light axle load of around 12 tons meant they could travel on all lines, and the dual cab arrangement eliminated the need for turning. They were quickly allocated to express passenger trains including the ''[[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] Express'', ''[[Transwa Australind|Australind]]'', ''[[Kalgoorlie]] Express'' and ''[[The Westland]]''. Although considered as good runners, the eight driving wheels being attached to the rigid main frame caused these locomotives to ride roughly.\n\n==The Crossley engine==\nAt the time of construction, the HST-V8 was an untested concept, though the engine itself was an evolution of a design used successfully in patrol boats during World War Two<ref>Doncaster, N: The Crossley Experience''' \"The Partyline\"''' - the in-house magazine of Steamtown Peterborough. Number 71, Spring 1998</ref>. One line of thought is the motor was an evolution of either of the HRN8 marine diesel, or the HRP8 stationary diesel <ref name=puse>Pusenjak,N 2014 The Westland: The Journal of Rail Heritage WA - Special Edition X Class 60th Anniversary, The WAGR X Class Locomotive; A look back with todays hindsight pp5-18</ref>.\n\nFailures commenced within weeks of the first locomotives being unveiled. It was only the skill of staff at WAGR's [[Midland Railway Workshops]] that saved the day. In their early days, availability was less than for steam.\n\nThe engines used Crossley's system of [[exhaust pulse pressure charging]] and developed 1,200 horsepower (895&nbsp;kW) at 625&nbsp;rpm, though in 1981 they were down-rated to 875&nbsp;hp at 600rpm. There were no valves, and inlet and exhaust were via ports in the cylinder walls.\n\nThe engines burnt and leaked oil, had underfed bearings, vibrated and popped heads and pistons, and suffered from ring scuffing for most of their lives. It was only the engineering excellence, and perseverance of Midland Railway Workshops staff that kept the locomotives operating, and performance improving. In the end, over 600 design faults, mainly in the Crossley engine, were overcome. One of the strategies used to minimise problems was to de-rate the engine to 1045hp (officially quoted as 1000hp).\n\nBecause of the multitudinous problems, rumours persisted that the engine was either war surplus, or formerly from a sub-maritime application.<ref name=OB1 >Oberg, L ''Locomotives of Australia'', Reed Books 1975</ref> Neither of these are correct, despite some publications suggesting this.<ref name=LOberg >{{cite book|last=Oberg|first=Leon|title=Locomotives of Australia 1850s-1980s|year=1984|publisher=Reed Books|location=Frenchs Forest|isbn=0 730100 05 7|page=214}}</ref> The myth may have arisen from Crossleys success in delivering robust engines for marine and other modes of transport.
