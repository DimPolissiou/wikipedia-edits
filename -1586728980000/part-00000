Four identical 16th-century astrolabes made by [[Georg Hartmann]] provide some of the earliest evidence for [[batch production]] by [[division of labor]].\n\n===Astrolabes and clocks===\n\n[[File:Het gebruik van het astrolabium door Amerigo Vespucci, Jan Collaert II, Museum Plantin-Moretus, PK.OPB.0186.018.jpg|thumb|[[Amerigo Vespucci]] observing the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] with an Astrolabium, by [[Jan Collaert II]]. [[Museum Plantin-Moretus]], [[Antwerp]], Belgium.]]\n\nMechanical [[astronomical clock]]s were initially influenced by the astrolabe; they could be seen in many ways as clockwork astrolabes designed to produce a continual display of the current position of the sun, stars, and planets. For example, [[Richard of Wallingford]]'s clock (c. 1330) consisted essentially of a star map rotating behind a fixed rete, similar to that of an astrolabe.{{sfn|North| 2005}}\n\nMany astronomical clocks use an astrolabe-style display, such as the famous [[Prague Orloj|clock at Prague]], adopting a stereographic projection (see below) of the ecliptic plane. In recent times, astrolabe watches have become popular. For example, Swiss watchmaker [[Ludwig Oechslin|Dr. Ludwig Oechslin]] designed and built an astrolabe wristwatch in conjunction with [[Ulysse Nardin]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ulysse-nardin.ch/en/swiss_watch_manufacturer/Collection/Archive/Astrolabium_G._Galilei.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102024043/http://www.ulysse-nardin.ch/en/swiss_watch_manufacturer/Collection/Archive/Astrolabium_G._Galilei.html |archive-date=2 January 2011 |title=Astrolabium G.

A [[tympan]] is made for a specific [[latitude]] and is engraved with a [[stereographic projection]] of [[circle]]s denoting [[azimuth]] and [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] and representing the portion of the [[celestial sphere]] above the local horizon. The rim of the mater is typically graduated into [[hour|hours of time]], [[Degree (angle)|degrees of arc]], or both.<ref name=\"Stephenson 2000 108\u2013109\">{{cite book |last=Stephenson|first=Bruce |first2=Marvin|last2=Bolt |first3=Anna Felicity|last3=Friedman |title=The Universe Unveiled: Instruments and Images through History|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-79143-X|pages=108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nAbove the mater and tympan, the ''rete'', a framework bearing a projection of the [[ecliptic]] plane and several [[Pointer (rod)|pointers]] indicating the positions of the brightest [[star]]s, is free to rotate. These pointers are often just simple points, but depending on the skill of the craftsman can be very elaborate and artistic. There are examples of astrolabes with artistic pointers in the shape of balls, stars, snakes, hands, dogs' heads, and leaves, among others.<ref name=\"Stephenson 2000 108\u2013109\"/> The names of the indicated stars were often engraved on the pointers in Arabic or Latin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/astrolabe.htm|title=Star Names on Astrolabes|publisher=Ian Ridpath|accessdate=2016-11-12}}</ref> Some astrolabes have a narrow ''[[ruler|rule]]'' or ''label'' which rotates over the rete, and may be marked with a scale of [[declination]]s.\n\nThe rete, representing the [[sky]], functions as a [[star chart]]. When it is rotated, the stars and the [[ecliptic]] move over the projection of the coordinates on the tympan. One complete rotation corresponds to the passage of a day. The astrolabe is, therefore, a predecessor of the modern [[planisphere]].\n\nOn the back of the mater, there is often engraved a number of scales that are useful in the astrolabe's various applications. These vary from designer to designer, but might include curves for time conversions, a [[calendar]] for converting the day of the month to the sun's position on the ecliptic, trigonometric scales, and graduation of 360 degrees around the back edge. The ''[[alidade]]'' is attached to the back face. An alidade can be seen in the lower right illustration of the Persian astrolabe above. When the astrolabe is held vertically, the alidade can be rotated and the sun or a star sighted along its length, so that its altitude in degrees can be read (\"taken\") from the graduated edge of the astrolabe; hence the word's Greek roots: \"astron\" (\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd) = star + \"lab-\" (\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2-) = to take.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world]]\n* [[List of astronomical instruments]]\n* [[Philippe Danfrie]], designer and maker of [[mathematical instrument]]s, globes and astrolabes\n* [[Sextant]]\n\n==References==\n;Footnotes\n{{notelist}}\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|2}}\n;Bibliography\n* {{Citation | last=Evans | first=James | author-link= | date=1998 | title=The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn =0-19-509539-1|ref=none}}.\n* {{Citation| first1=Alessandro|last1= Gunella| first2=John| last2= Lamprey| title=Stoeffler's Elucidatio (translation of Elucidatio fabricae ususque astrolabii into English)|publisher=  John Lamprey|date= 2007|ref=none}}\n* {{citation| volume = 5\n| pages = 43\u201383\n| last = King\n| first = D.

For example, [[Richard of Wallingford]]'s clock (c. 1330) consisted essentially of a star map rotating behind a fixed rete, similar to that of an astrolabe.{{sfn|North| 2005}}\n\nMany astronomical clocks use an astrolabe-style display, such as the famous [[Prague Orloj|clock at Prague]], adopting a stereographic projection (see below) of the ecliptic plane. In recent times, astrolabe watches have become popular.

A [[tympan]] is made for a specific [[latitude]] and is engraved with a [[stereographic projection]] of [[circle]]s denoting [[azimuth]] and [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] and representing the portion of the [[celestial sphere]] above the local horizon. The rim of the mater is typically graduated into [[hour|hours of time]], [[Degree (angle)|degrees of arc]], or both.<ref name=\"Stephenson 2000 108\u2013109\">{{cite book |last=Stephenson|first=Bruce |first2=Marvin|last2=Bolt |first3=Anna Felicity|last3=Friedman |title=The Universe Unveiled: Instruments and Images through History|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-79143-X|pages=108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nAbove the mater and tympan, the ''rete'', a framework bearing a projection of the [[ecliptic]] plane and several [[Pointer (rod)|pointers]] indicating the positions of the brightest [[star]]s, is free to rotate. These pointers are often just simple points, but depending on the skill of the craftsman can be very elaborate and artistic. There are examples of astrolabes with artistic pointers in the shape of balls, stars, snakes, hands, dogs' heads, and leaves, among others.<ref name=\"Stephenson 2000 108\u2013109\"/> The names of the indicated stars were often engraved on the pointers in Arabic or Latin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/astrolabe.htm|title=Star Names on Astrolabes|publisher=Ian Ridpath|accessdate=2016-11-12}}</ref> Some astrolabes have a narrow ''[[ruler|rule]]'' or ''label'' which rotates over the rete, and may be marked with a scale of [[declination]]s.\n\nThe rete, representing the [[sky]], functions as a [[star chart]]. When it is rotated, the stars and the [[ecliptic]] move over the projection of the coordinates on the tympan. One complete rotation corresponds to the passage of a day. The astrolabe is, therefore, a predecessor of the modern [[planisphere]].\n\nOn the back of the mater, there is often engraved a number of scales that are useful in the astrolabe's various applications. These vary from designer to designer, but might include curves for time conversions, a [[calendar]] for converting the day of the month to the sun's position on the ecliptic, trigonometric scales, and graduation of 360 degrees around the back edge. The ''[[alidade]]'' is attached to the back face. An alidade can be seen in the lower right illustration of the Persian astrolabe above. When the astrolabe is held vertically, the alidade can be rotated and the sun or a star sighted along its length, so that its altitude in degrees can be read (\"taken\") from the graduated edge of the astrolabe; hence the word's Greek roots: \"astron\" (\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd) = star + \"lab-\" (\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2-) = to take.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world]]\n* [[List of astronomical instruments]]\n* [[Philippe Danfrie]], designer and maker of [[mathematical instrument]]s, globes and astrolabes\n* [[Sextant]]\n\n==References==\n;Footnotes\n{{notelist}}\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|2}}\n;Bibliography\n* {{Citation | last=Evans | first=James | author-link= | date=1998 | title=The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn =0-19-509539-1}}.\n* {{Citation| first1=Alessandro|last1= Gunella| first2=John| last2= Lamprey| title=Stoeffler's Elucidatio (translation of Elucidatio fabricae ususque astrolabii into English)|publisher=  John Lamprey|date= 2007}}\n* {{citation| volume = 5\n| pages = 43\u201383\n| last = King\n| first = D.

It was released on October 30, 2007, by [[Jive Records]]. It was originally scheduled to be released on November 13 in the United States, but was rush-released after being [[internet leak|leaked]] online. The album was recorded between 2006 and 2007, during which time Spears' personal struggles and erratic behavior were highly publicized and overshadowed her professional projects. Spears collaborated with producers including [[Danja (record producer)|Danja]], [[Bloodshy & Avant]], [[Sean Garrett]], and [[The Neptunes]]. ''Blackout'' is a primarily [[dance-pop]] and [[electropop]] record with [[Euro disco]] and [[dubstep]] influences; lyrical themes revolve around love, fame, media scrutiny, sex, and clubbing. The project features a more foreboding and atmospheric tone compared to Spears' previous albums.\n\n''Blackout'' received generally positive reviews from music critics, some of whom described it as Spears' most progressive and consistent album. It debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 290,000 copies after a last-minute rule change, and became Spears' first studio album not to debut at number one in the United States. However, it was later certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for exceeding one million shipments. The album charted within the top ten of several national charts internationally and has topped the albums chart in Canada, Ireland, and the pan-[[European Top 100 Albums]] and has attained several certifications worldwide, including gold certification in seven countries, platinum in four countries, and multi-platinum in Russia.\n\nThe singles \"[[Gimme More]]\", \"[[Piece of Me (Britney Spears song)|Piece of Me]]\", and \"[[Break the Ice (song)|Break the Ice]]\" respectively peaked at numbers three, 18, and 43 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Unlike her previous albums, Spears did not heavily promote ''Blackout''; her only televised appearance for ''Blackout'' was [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards#Britney Spears' performance|a universally panned performance]] of \"Gimme More\" at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]]. However, many of the songs of ''Blackout'' were performed on her tour [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]] in 2009. Retrospectively, ''Blackout'' received widespread acclaim, with some citing its influence on pop music years later and it also ranked on many end-of-decade lists. ''[[The Times]]'' named it as the fifth best pop album of the decade.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 best pop albums of the Noughties {{!}} The Times|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/music/article2417940.ece|website=The Times|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> In 2012, the album was added to the library and archives of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In 2019, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named ''Blackout'' one of the most influential pop albums to impact the 2010s.<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/biggest-pop-influences-on-2010s-927808/</ref>\n\n== Background and development ==\n[[File:You Want a Piece of Me?

The magazine's senior analyst and director of charts Geoff Mayfield explained he was frustrated by the situation, saying: \"I can believe the Eagles sold more, but I'm not seeing anything that verifies for me that they outsold her and anything we see otherwise might be from people with a stake in suggesting that.\" During the afternoon of the same day, Walmart issued a press release announcing that ''Long Road Out of Eden'' had sold 711,000 copies. At night, it was announced through an article on ''Billboard.biz'' that after an agreement with Nielsen SoundScan, ''Billboard'' would allow exclusive album titles that were only available through one retailer to appear on the charts, effective that same week.

Ewing explained that \"The ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' blueprint for pop albums \u2013 every track good, every track a potential hit \u2013 makes more sense than ever. Especially if a star can keep sonically up-to-date in a fast-moving market.\"<ref name=pitchfork />\n\nReviewers noted the use of [[Auto-Tune]] in Spears' voice.<ref name=pitchfork /><ref name=telephone /> Ewing said that ''Blackout'' serves as a reminder of how instantly recognizable Spears' vocals are, saying that \"treated or untreated: her thin Southern huskiness is one of the defining sounds of 00s pop.\" He noted that the album \"is a masterclass in autotune and vocal treatment as a studio instrument, disrupting and jamming the songs as much as it helps them.\"<ref name=pitchfork /> While reviewing Spears' demo of \"[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]\", Rob Sheffield of ''Rolling Stone'' compared it to \"Piece of Me\", \"proving yet again how much impact Britney has had on the sonics of current pop.

It was released on October 30, 2007, by [[Jive Records]]. It was originally scheduled to be released on November 13 in the United States, but was rush-released after being [[internet leak|leaked]] online. The album was recorded between 2006 and 2007, during which time Spears' personal struggles and erratic behavior were highly publicized and overshadowed her professional projects. Spears collaborated with producers including [[Danja (record producer)|Danja]], [[Bloodshy & Avant]], [[Sean Garrett]], and [[The Neptunes]]. ''Blackout'' is a primarily [[dance-pop]] and [[electropop]] record with [[Euro disco]] and [[dubstep]] influences; lyrical themes revolve around love, fame, media scrutiny, sex, and clubbing. The project features a more foreboding and atmospheric tone compared to Spears' previous albums.\n\n''Blackout'' received generally positive reviews from music critics, some of whom described it as Spears' most progressive and consistent album. It debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 290,000 copies after a last-minute rule change, and became Spears' first studio album not to debut at number one in the United States. However, it was later certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for exceeding one million shipments. The album charted within the top ten of several national charts internationally and has topped the albums chart in Canada, Ireland, and the pan-[[European Top 100 Albums]] and has attained several certifications worldwide, including gold certification in seven countries, platinum in four countries, and multi-platinum in Russia.\n\nThe singles \"[[Gimme More]]\", \"[[Piece of Me (Britney Spears song)|Piece of Me]]\", and \"[[Break the Ice (song)|Break the Ice]]\" respectively peaked at numbers three, 18, and 43 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Unlike her previous albums, Spears did not heavily promote ''Blackout''; her only televised appearance for ''Blackout'' was [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards#Britney Spears' performance|a universally panned performance]] of \"Gimme More\" at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]]. However, many of the songs of ''Blackout'' were performed on her tour [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]] in 2009. Retrospectively, ''Blackout'' received widespread acclaim, with some citing its influence on pop music years later and it also ranked on many end-of-decade lists. ''[[The Times]]'' named it as the fifth best pop album of the decade.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 best pop albums of the Noughties {{!}} The Times|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/music/article2417940.ece|website=The Times|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> In 2012, the album was added to the library and archives of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In 2019, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named ''Blackout'' one of the most influential pop albums to impact the 2010s.<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/biggest-pop-influences-on-2010s-927808/</ref>\n\n== Background and development ==\n[[File:You Want a Piece of Me?

Jessica Letkemann of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' compared the sales favorably to those of the number-one album of the previous week, [[Carrie Underwood]]'s ''[[Carnival Ride]]'', which sold 49,000 copies. Letkemann also estimated that ''Blackout'' would possibly debut atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1573290/20071101/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Britney Spears' Blackout Projected To Light Up The Charts For Fifth No. 1 Debut|work=MTV News|last=Harris|first=Chris|date=November 1, 2007|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> On November 6, 2007, ''Billboard'' announced that even though [[The Eagles]]'s first-week sales of ''[[Long Road Out of Eden]]'' had handily surpassed Spears, they would not debut atop the chart because of rules forbidding albums exclusively sold at one retail outlet ([[Walmart]] in this case) from entering the ''Billboard'' 200. The magazine's senior analyst and director of charts Geoff Mayfield explained he was frustrated by the situation, saying: \"I can believe the Eagles sold more, but I'm not seeing anything that verifies for me that they outsold her and anything we see otherwise might be from people with a stake in suggesting that.\" During the afternoon of the same day, Walmart issued a press release announcing that ''Long Road Out of Eden'' had sold 711,000 copies. At night, it was announced through an article on ''Billboard.biz'' that after an agreement with Nielsen SoundScan, ''Billboard'' would allow exclusive album titles that were only available through one retailer to appear on the charts, effective that same week. Hence ''Long Road Out of Eden'' would top the ''Billboard'' 200, while ''Blackout'' would debut at number two, with sales of 290,000 copies.<ref name=eagles>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1573657/britney-spears-blackout-denied-1-debut.jhtml|title=Britney Spears' Blackout Denied No. 1 Debut On Billboard Chart After Last-Minute Rule Change|work=MTV News|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=November 7, 2007|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> It became Spears' first studio album not to debut at number one.<ref name=recorddigital>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/britney-spears-debuts-1-on-european-albums-chart-and-debuts-1-on-us-digital-albums-chart-58819832.html|title=Britney Spears Debuts #1 on European Albums Chart and Debuts #1 on U.S. Digital Albums Chart|date=November 8, 2007|accessdate=August 19, 2011|publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}</ref> The album, however, set the record as the best-selling digital album debut by a female artist in a week at the time.<ref name=recorddigital /> Following the release of ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' in December 2008, ''Blackout'' re-entered the chart at number one-hundred-and-ninety-eight, with sales of 4,600 copies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1601037/20081210/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Britney Spears Is Back On Top As Circus Sells More Than 500,000 Copies|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=December 10, 2008|work=MTV News|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> As of March 2015, the album had been certified Platinum in the United States for shipments of 1 Million copies.

Ewing explained that \"The ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' blueprint for pop albums \u2013 every track good, every track a potential hit \u2013 makes more sense than ever.

The [[Connecticut Tigers|new team]] would play their games in the newly renvoted [[Dodd Stadium]] which had been vacated by the [[Connecticut Defenders]] of the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]], who had left for [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Miller also said in the press release that he had hoped to have organized baseball playing in Damaschke Field for the 2010 baseball season, but early indications showed that local Oneonta High School will use the field for playing purposes as early as their 2010 season.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n\n===Hall of Fame alumni===\n\n* [[John Elway]] (1982) Inducted, [[National Football League Hall of Fame| Pro Football Hall of Fame]]\n\n===Notable alumni===\n\n* [[Brad Ausmus]] (1988-1989) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Dave Bergman]] (1974)\n\n* [[Tom Brookens]] (2005-2006) \n\n* [[Ken Brett]] (1966) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Mike DeJean]] (1992)\n\n* [[Dave Eiland]] (1987) \n\n* [[Damaso Garcia]] (1975) 2 x MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Cesar Geronimo]] (1967)\n\n* [[Curtis Granderson]] (2002) 3 x MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Mike Heath]] (1974)\n\n* [[Sterling Hitchcock]] (1993)\n\n* [[Rex Hudler]] (1978)\n\n* [[Jair Jurrjens]] (2004) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Ricky Ledee]] (1993)\n\n* [[Al Leiter]] (1984-1985) 2 x MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Jim Leyritz]] (1986)\n\n* [[Mike Lowell]] (1995) 4 x MLB All-Star; 2003 World Series Most Valuable Player\n\n* [[Tippy Martinez]] (1972) MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Don Mattingly]] (1979) 6 x MLB All-Star; 1984 AL Batting Title; 1985 AL Most Valuable Player\n\n* [[Andy McGaffigan]] (1978)\n\n* [[Willie McGee]] (1977) MLB All-Star; 2 x NL Batting Champion (1985, 1990) 1985 NL Most Valuable Player\n\n* [[Doc Medich]] (1970)\n\n* [[Amos Otis]] (1966) 5 x MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Mike Pagliarulo]] (1981)\n\n* [[Andy Pettitte]] (1991) 3 x MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Jorge Posada]] (1991) 5 x MLB All-Star\n\n* [[Dan Pasqua]] (1982)\n\n* [[Domingo Ramos]] (1975)\n\n* [[Buck Showalter]] (1985-1986) 3 x AL Manager of the Year (1994, 2004, 2014)\n\n* [[J.T.

Thus, in contrast to widely publicized reports to the contrary, the species appears to have many beneficial ecological effects on aquatic communities in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAquarist Jean Jaubert, director of the aforementioned Oceanographic Museum of Monaco, has said that the affected areas in the nearby Bay of Menton have been exaggerated 100-fold.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Reproduction mechanism===\nThe aquarium strain reproduces [[asexual reproduction|asexually]], that is, vegetatively: the viscous, elastic white fluid inside the stem was found under the microscope to contain only male [[gamete]]s. Rate of growth can be as fast as a centimeter per day. If any small part is severed from the rest of the alga, this small part will regrow into another alga. Anchors of ships and fishing nets can serve as carriers for ''Caulerpa''. Thus, this alga has been found to jump from the coast of one port city to the coast of another port city. The natural strain has both male and female individuals and additionally reproduces sexually. Gametes are expelled from each sex and meet to form a zygote which then goes through two larval stages before becoming an adult.\n\n===Other introductions===\nIn 2000, the strain was found on the coast of [[California]] (U.S.), near [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], and also on the coast of [[New South Wales]], Australia. The California colonization was small enough to be considered controllable: it was covered with [[tarpaulin]] which was held down with sandbags at the edges of the infestation. Then [[chlorine]] was poured in through tubes which fed into certain openings in the tarpaulin: the interior of the tarpaulin filled up with chlorine and killed living organisms inside it, not only the unwanted alga but also fish, invertebrates and other seaweeds. The killing of such other organisms was not desirable but was deemed preferable to letting the algae grow unchecked.\n\nThe appearance off the California coast was most probably caused by an aquarium owner improperly dumping the contents, allowing ''C. taxifolia'' to flow through a [[storm sewer]] into the lagoon where the invasion was discovered. California has since passed a law forbidding the possession, sale or transport of ''Caulerpa taxifolia'' within the state. There is also a federal law under the [[Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974|Noxious Weed Act]] forbidding interstate sale and transport of the aquarium strain ''Caulerpa''.\n\nIn July 2006, the alga had been declared eradicated from the two Southern California locations (Agua Hedionda Lagoon in [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]] and Seagate Lagoon in [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]]).\n\n===Possible natural control method===\nResearchers at the [[University of Nice]] in France have been studying a tiny aquatic slug which is a natural predator of ''C. taxifolia''.<ref>Thibaut, T. 2001.

This slug is believed to feed exclusively on ''C. taxifolia'', by sticking its [[proboscis]] into the stem and sucking out the white viscous liquid inside the stem: this causes the alga to become limp, discolored, and dead. As the slug does so, it absorbs the alga's poison. The slug has an [[enzyme]] which neutralizes the noxious effect of the poison, and at the same time, the poison protects the slug from being eaten by fish. However, this slug cannot survive in the cooler waters of the Mediterranean and, therefore, is unable to control the invasive alga there.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Caulerpa taxifolia - National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo - DSC07620.JPG|''C. taxifolia'' on display at the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan.\nFile:CaulerpaTaxifolia.jpg|A field of ''C. taxifolia'' amongst [[seagrass]].\nFile:Lysmata amboinensis on Caulerpa taxifolia.jpg|A [[Pacific cleaner shrimp]] (''Lysmata amboinensis'') on top of a ''C. taxifolia'' specimen within a [[marine aquarium]].\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n* Peplow, M. 2005.

[http://www.unice.fr/LEML/Pages/Pub_LEML/Thibaut%20et%20al%202001.pdf \"Elysia subornata a potential control agent of the alga Caulerpa taxifolia in the Mediterranean Sea\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025162409/http://www.unice.fr/LEML/Pages/Pub_LEML/Thibaut%20et%20al%202001.pdf |date=2005-10-25 }}, ''[[Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom]]''</ref> Called ''[[Elysia subornata]]'', it was found off the coast of [[Florida]], in waters warmer than those in the Mediterranean. This slug is believed to feed exclusively on ''C. taxifolia'', by sticking its [[proboscis]] into the stem and sucking out the white viscous liquid inside the stem: this causes the alga to become limp, discolored, and dead. As the slug does so, it absorbs the alga's poison. The slug has an [[enzyme]] which neutralizes the noxious effect of the poison, and at the same time, the poison protects the slug from being eaten by fish. However, this slug cannot survive in the cooler waters of the Mediterranean and, therefore, is unable to control the invasive alga there.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Caulerpa taxifolia - National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo - DSC07620.JPG|''C. taxifolia'' on display at the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan.\nFile:CaulerpaTaxifolia.jpg|A field of ''C. taxifolia'' amongst [[seagrass]].\nFile:Lysmata amboinensis on Caulerpa taxifolia.jpg|A [[Pacific cleaner shrimp]] (''Lysmata amboinensis'') on top of a ''C. taxifolia'' specimen within a [[marine aquarium]].\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n* Peplow, M. 2005.

Among academics in [[Germanic philology]], the document is widely considered to be a [[hoax]] or [[forgery]].\n\nThe manuscript first came to public awareness in the 1860s.

[http://www.semafoor.net/Jensmareactie.htm]</ref>\n\n==History of reception==\n\n===19th century===\nThe Oera Linda Book, known in [[Old Frisian]] as ''Thet Oera Linda Bok'', came to light in 1867 when Cornelis Over de Linden (1811&ndash;1874) handed the manuscript, which he claimed to have inherited from his grandfather, via his aunt, over to Eelco Verwijs (1830&ndash;1880), the provincial librarian of Friesland, for translation and publication. Verwijs rejected the manuscript, but in 1872 Jan Gerhardus Ottema (1804&ndash;1879), a prominent member of the Frisian Society for History and Culture, published a Dutch translation. Ottema believed it to be written in authentic [[Old Frisian]]. The book was subsequently translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876, and published by Tr\u00fcbner & Co. of London.\n\nWithin the first few years after the appearance of the Oera Linda Book, its recent origin was established not only based on the exceptional claims being made, but also because of a number of anachronisms it contained. The text was nevertheless a source of inspiration for a number of occultists and speculative historians. While there was some debate among Dutch academics and in a number of newspapers about the book's authenticity during the 1870s, by 1879 it was widely recognized as a forgery.\n\n===Nazi Germany===\nMore than forty years later, beginning in 1922, Dutch ''[[v\u00f6lkisch]]'' philologist [[Herman Wirth]] revived the issue. Wirth published a German translation of what he dubbed the \"Nordic Bible\" in 1933, as ''Die Ura Linda Chronik''.\n\nA panel discussion on Wirth's book at the University of Berlin on 4 May 1934 was the immediate impulse for the foundation of the [[Ahnenerbe]] Nazi \"[[think tank]]\" by [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] and Wirth, together with [[Richard Walther Darr\u00e9]]. Because of the infatuation of Himmler with the Oera Linda Book and its consequent association with Nazi occultism, it became known as \"Himmler's Bible\". Wirth's book was by no means universally acclaimed among the Nazi-era Nordicist academics, and the 1934 panel discussion was steeped in heated controversy. [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and his circle rejected it. [[Gustav Neckel]] had praised Wirth's work before publication, but upon seeing its content published a dismayed recension.<ref>''Der Tag'', Berlin, 31. December 1933.</ref>\n\nSpeaking in defense of the book's authenticity were [[Walther W\u00fcst]] and [[Otto Huth]], besides Wirth himself. Speaking against its authenticity were Neckel, Karl Hermann Jacob-Friesen (who identified it as a satirical hoax by Linden) and [[Arthur H\u00fcbner]]. H\u00fcbner was one of the most respected Germanists of his generation, and his verdict of the Oera Linda being a falsification settled the defeat of Wirth's party. The public defeat of Himmler's scholarly brand of \"esoteric Nordicism\" resulted in the foundation of Ahnenerbe, which attracted occultists such as [[Karl Maria Wiligut]] and was viewed with suspicion by the mainstream National Socialist ideologues of [[Amt Rosenberg]].<ref>Gerd Simon, [http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/gerd.simon/himmlerbibel.pdf Himmlers Bibel und die \u00f6ffentlichkeitswirksamste Podiumsdiskussion in der Geschichte der Germanistik]</ref>\n\n===Modern esotericism===\nThe book experienced a revival of popularity in the English-speaking world with the writings of Robert Scrutton.

These cars were later tested at the UMTA and the USDOT testing facility in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] for evaluation, before being returned to the MTA in 1976 for in-service testing on all BMT/IND lines to check the effectiveness of the technology.\n\nIn 1977, pantograph gates, salvaged from retired [[Arnines|R1 through R9 cars]], were modified and installed on the front ends of the R42s. Baloney coiled spring type inter car safety barriers were also installed on the blind ends of the married pairs.\n\nBetween 1988 and 1989, the R42s underwent overhaul as a result of deferred maintenance in the New York City Subway during the 1970s and the 1980s. 282 cars (most cars from 4550 to 4839) were overhauled by Morrison-Knudsen while the last 110 cars (4840\u20134949) were rebuilt in-house by the [[Coney Island Complex|Coney Island Overhaul Shop]] in [[Brooklyn]].
