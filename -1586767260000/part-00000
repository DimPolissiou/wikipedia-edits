During [[World War II]], Rusk served as a staff officer in the [[China Burma India Theater]]. He was hired by the [[United States Department of State]] in 1945 and became Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs in 1950. In 1952, Rusk became president of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].\n\nAfter winning the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]], Kennedy asked Rusk to serve as secretary of state. He supported diplomatic efforts during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and, though he initially expressed doubts about the escalation of the U.S. role in the [[Vietnam War]], became known as one of its strongest supporters. Rusk served for the duration of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations before retiring from public office in 1969.

He played an influential part in the US decision to become involved in the [[Korean War]], and in Japan's postwar compensation for victorious countries, such as the [[Rusk documents]]. Rusk was a cautious diplomat and always sought international support.\n\nWhen the question arose about whatever the United States should support the French war to hang to their colony of Indochina against the Communist Viet Minh guerrillas, Rusk argued for support to France, stating that the Viet Minh were just the instruments of Soviet expansionism in Asia and to refuse to support the French would be an appeasement.<ref name=\"Vietnam: A History 179\" /> Under strong American pressure, the French granted nominal independence to the State of Vietnam in February 1950 under the Emperor Bao Dai, which the United States recognized within days.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam: A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.180</ref> However, it was widely known that the State of Vietnam was still in effect a French colony as French officials controlled all of the important ministries and the Emperor bitterly remarked to the press: \"What they call a Bao Dai solution turns out to be just a French solution\".<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam: A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.175</ref> In June 1950, Rush testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: \"This is a civil war that has been in effect captured by the [Soviet] Politburo and, besides, has been turned into a tool of the Politburo.

Vietnamese took part in a diplomatic effort to end the war first.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam: A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.377</ref> U Thant reported to Rusk that the Soviet pressure

to Saudi Arabia, it had the opposite effect. Johnson, who was more pro-Israeli than Kennedy had been, was furious with the speech. Rusk later recalled: \"We didn't expect Nasser to bow, scrape, lick our boots, and say 'Thank you Uncle Sam', but we did expect to at least moderate his virulent criticism of the United States. Instead, he got up in front of those big crowds in Cairo and shouted such things as 'Throw your aid into the Red Sea!'\".<ref>Ferris, Jesse ''Nasser's Gamble'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013 p.138</ref> On 5 January 1965, Johnson suspended all PL 480 aid to Egypt, an action that immediately plunged the Egyptian economy into a crisis.<ref>Ferris, Jesse ''Nasser's Gamble'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013 p.138-139</ref> Nasser realized what he had done and began to lobby for the resumption of PL 480 food sales, but got nowhere.<ref>Ferris, Jesse ''Nasser's Gamble'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013 p.139</ref> Through Nasser knew the best way of ending the crisis was to pull out of Yemen and seek a rapprochement with Saudi Arabia and the United States, he instead turned towards the Soviet Union to seek support for the rapidly contracting Egyptian economy.<ref>Ferris, Jesse ''Nasser's Gamble'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013 p.141</ref> \u00a0 \n\nOn March 19, 1965, Rusk commented that Russia was appearing \"disinclined to put its full weight behind\" international agreements on Vietnam and Laos during a press conference.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1965/03/20/page/4/article/russia-fails-to-back-viet-pacts-rusk|title=Russia Fails To Back Viet Pacts - Rusk|date=March 20, 1965|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> In June 1965, when General William Westmoreland requested of Johnson 180, 000 troops to Vietnam, Rusk argued to Johnson that the United States had to fight in Vietnam to maintain \"the integrity of the U.S. commitment\" throughout the world, but also wondered aloud if Westermoreland was exaggerating the extent of the problems in South Vietnam in order to have more troops under his command.<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam: A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.423</ref> In 1964 and again in 1965, Rusk approached the British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] to ask for British troops to go to Vietnam, requests that were refused.

A crucial element will be a clear demonstration that we have explored fully every alternative but the aggressors has left us no choice\".<ref>Karnow, Stanley ''Vietnam: A History'', New York: Viking, 1983 p.483</ref> Rusk ordered [[Henry A.

Kennedy'' (1967) pp 40-43.</ref> Jonathan Coleman says that he was deeply involved in Berlin Crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis, NATO, and Vietnam. Typically he was highly cautious on most issues, except for Vietnam:\n:He established only a distant relationship with President Kennedy but worked more closely with President Johnson. Both presidents appreciated his loyalty and his low\u2010key style. Although an indefatigable worker, Rusk exhibited little talent as a manager of the Department of State.<ref>Jonathan Coleman, \"Rusk, Dean (1909\u201394)' in Gordon Martel, ed.  ''The Encyclopedia of Diplomacy'' (2018)  https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118885154.dipl0478</ref>\n\nRegarding Vietnam, historians agree that President Johnson relied heavily on the advice of Rusk, Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]], and national security adviser [[McGeorge Bundy]] to the effect that a communist takeover of all of Vietnam was unacceptable, and the only way to prevent it was to escalate America's commitment. Johnson took their conclusions and rejected dissenting views.<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert D. |last=Schulzinger |chapter=Fighting the Vietnam War |editor=Mitchell B.

His taciturn qualities, which served him so well in negotiating with the Russians, ill-prepared him for the wrenching, introspective, soul-shattering journey that a true reappraisal of Vietnam policy would have involved. Although trained for high office, he was unprepared for such a journey, for admitting that thousands of American lives, and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese, might have been lost in vain\".<ref name=\"New Light on Dean Rusk126\" /> \n\nGeorge Herring wrote about Rusk in 1992: \"He is a man utterly without pretense, a thoroughly decent individual, a man of stern countenance and unbending principles. He is a man with a passion for secrecy. He is a shy and reticent man, who as Secretary of State sipped scotch to loosen his tongue for press conferences. Stolid and normally laconic, he also has a keen, dry wit. He has often been described as the \"perfect number two,\" a loyal subordinate who had strong- if unexpressed-reservations about the Bay of Pigs operation, but after its failure could defend it as though he had planned it\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Herring |first1=George |title=Rusks on Rusk: A Georgian's Life as Collaborative Autobiography |journal=The Georgia Historical Quarterly |date=Spring 1992 |volume=76 |issue=1 |page=66}}</ref>\n\nSummarizing the views of historians and political scientists,  Smith Simpson states:\n:Here was a man who had much going for him but failed in crucial respects. A decent, intelligent, well-educated man of broad experience in world affairs who, early in life, evidenced qualities of leadership, seemed diffidently to hold back rather than to lead as secretary of state, seeming to behave, in important ways, like a sleeve-plucking follower of presidents rather than their wise and persuasive counselor.<ref> Smith Simpson, \"Featured Review\"  ''Perspectives on Political Science'' (1991) 20#4 221-49 [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10457097.1991.9944494?journalCode=vpps20 Excerpt]</ref>\n\n==Media==\n'''Appearances'''\n* ''Cuban Missile Crisis Revisited''.

In 1952, Rusk became president of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].\n\nAfter winning the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]], Kennedy asked Rusk to serve as secretary of state.

The Dean Rusk International Studies Program at Davidson College is also named in his honor.\n\n[[Dean Rusk Middle School]], located in Canton, Georgia, was named in his honor, as was Dean Rusk Hall on the campus of the University of Georgia.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe consensus of historians is that Rusk was a very intelligent man, but very shy and so deeply immersed in details and the complexities of each case, that he was reluctant to make a decision, and unable to clearly explain to the media what the government's policies were. <ref>[[Roger Hilsman]], ''To Move a Nation: The politics of foreign-policy in the administration of John F. Kennedy'' (1967) pp 40-43.</ref> Jonathan Coleman says that he was deeply involved in Berlin Crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis, NATO, and Vietnam. Typically he was highly cautious on most issues, except for Vietnam:\n:He established only a distant relationship with President Kennedy but worked more closely with President Johnson. Both presidents appreciated his loyalty and his low\u2010key style. Although an indefatigable worker, Rusk exhibited little talent as a manager of the Department of State.<ref>Jonathan Coleman, \"Rusk, Dean (1909\u201394)' in Gordon Martel, ed.  ''The Encyclopedia of Diplomacy'' (2018)  https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118885154.dipl0478</ref>\n\nRegarding Vietnam, historians agree that President Johnson relied heavily on the advice of Rusk, Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]], and national security adviser [[McGeorge Bundy]] to the effect that a communist takeover of all of Vietnam was unacceptable, and the only way to prevent it was to escalate America's commitment. Johnson took their conclusions and rejected dissenting views.<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert D. |last=Schulzinger |chapter=Fighting the Vietnam War |editor=Mitchell B.

His taciturn qualities, which served him so well in negotiating with the Russians, ill-prepared him for the wrenching, introspective, soul-shattering journey that a true reappraisal of Vietnam policy would have involved. Although trained for high office, he was unprepared for such a journey, for admitting that thousands of American lives, and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese, might have been lost in vain\".<ref name=\"New Light on Dean Rusk126\" /> \n\nGeorge Herring wrote about Rusk in 1992: \"He is a man utterly without pretense, a thoroughly decent individual, a man of stern countenance and unbending principles. He is a man with a passion for secrecy. He is a shy and reticent man, who as Secretary of State sipped scotch to loosen his tongue for press conferences. Stolid and normally laconic, he also has a keen, dry wit. He has often been described as the \"perfect number two,\" a loyal subordinate who had strong- if unexpressed-reservations about the Bay of Pigs operation, but after its failure could defend it as though he had planned it\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Herring |first1=George |title=Rusks on Rusk: A Georgian's Life as Collaborative Autobiography |journal=The Georgia Historical Quarterly |date=Spring 1992 |volume=76 |issue=1 |page=66}}</ref>\n\nSummarizing the views of historians and political scientists,  Smith Simpson states:\n:Here was a man who had much going for him but failed in crucial respects. A decent, intelligent, well-educated man of broad experience in world affairs who, early in life, evidenced qualities of leadership, seemed diffidently to hold back rather than to lead as secretary of state, seeming to behave, in important ways, like a sleeve-plucking follower of presidents rather than their wise and persuasive counselor.<ref> Smith Simpson, \"Featured Review\"  ''Perspectives on Political Science'' (1991) 20#4 221-49 [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10457097.1991.9944494?journalCode=vpps20 Excerpt]</ref>\n\n==Media==\n'''Appearances'''\n* ''Cuban Missile Crisis Revisited''.

Magdalena's maternal grandparents were [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon]] and his wife queen [[Elisabeth of Austria (1436\u20131505)|Elisabeth of Austria]], daughter of [[Albert II of Germany]].\n\nShe was a granddaughter of the Elisabeth aforementioned, mother of the [[Jagiellonians]], queen of Poland, who had claimed the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]] in 1460s as being the younger daughter of the last Luxembourg heiress [[Elisabeth of Luxembourg, Queen of Bohemia]]. Though by no means an heiress of her grandmother, she was intended to wed the heir of her grandmother's older sister.

Based on the 1975 [[The Mothman Prophecies|book of the same name]] by [[parapsychology|parapsychologist]] and [[Charles Fort|Fortean]] author [[John Keel]], the screenplay was written by [[Richard Hatem]]. \n\nThe story follows John Klein (Gere), a reporter who researches the legend of the [[Mothman]]. Still shaken by the death of his wife, two years earlier in a mysterious accident. Klein is sent to cover a news piece and ends up inexplicably finding himself in [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia]], where there have been sightings of an unusual creature and other unexplained phenomena. As he becomes increasingly drawn into mysterious forces at work, he hopes they can reconnect him to his wife, while the local sheriff (Linney) becomes concerned about his obsessions.\n\nThe film claims to be based on actual events that occurred between November 1966 and December 1967 in Point Pleasant, as described by Keel. It was shot in  [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania]] and was released to mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist John Klein and his wife Mary are involved in an accident when Mary swerves to avoid a black, flying figure. John survives the crash unscathed, but Mary is hospitalized. After Mary dies of an unrelated [[glioblastoma|brain tumor]], John discovers mysterious drawings of the creature that she had created & materialscientist is gay whilst in hospital.\n\nTwo years later, John becomes lost in [[West Virginia]] and inexplicably finds himself in [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia|Point Pleasant]], hundreds of miles off his route. Driving in the middle of the night, his car breaks down; and he walks to a nearby house to get help. The owner, Gordon Smallwood, reacts violently to John's appearance and holds him at gunpoint. Local police officer Connie Mills defuses the situation while Gordon explains that this is the third consecutive night John has knocked on his door at 2:30 AM, asking to use a phone, much to John's confusion. John stays at a local motel and considers how he ended up so far from his original destination.\n\nOfficer Mills mentions to John that many strange things have been occurring in the past few weeks and that people report seeing a large winged creature like a giant [[moth]] with red eyes. She also tells John about a strange dream she had, in which the words \"Wake up, Number 37\" were spoken to her. During a conversation one day, Gordon reveals to John that he has heard voices coming from his sink telling him that, in [[Denver]], \"99 will die\". While discussing the day's events at a local diner, John notices that the news is showing the story of an airplane crash in Denver that killed all 99 passengers aboard. The next night Gordon frantically explains that the voices in his head emanate from a being named Indrid Cold.\n\nLater that night Gordon calls John and says that he is standing next to someone named Indrid Cold. While John keeps Cold on the line, Officer Mills checks on Gordon. Cold answers John's questions, including ones he could not possibly know the answers to, convincing John that Cold is a supernatural being. This episode starts a string of supernatural calls to John's motel room. One tells him that there will be a great tragedy on the [[Ohio River]]. Later John receives a call from Gordon and rushes to his home to check on him. He finds Gordon outside, dead from [[Hypothermia|exposure]].\n\nJohn becomes obsessed with the being dubbed the Mothman. He meets an expert on the subject, Alexander Leek, who explains its nature and discourages John from becoming further involved. However, when John learns the [[Governor of West Virginia|Governor]] plans to tour a chemical plant located on the Ohio River the following day, he becomes convinced the tragedy will occur there. Officer Mills and the governor ignore his warnings, and nothing happens during the tour. Soon afterwards, John receives a mysterious message that instructs him to await a call from his deceased wife Mary back in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], and he returns home.\n\nOn [[Christmas Eve]], Officer Mills calls and convinces him to ignore the phone call from \"Mary\", return to Point Pleasant, and join her. Though anguished, John agrees. As John reaches the [[Silver Bridge]], a malfunctioning traffic light causes traffic congestion. As John walks onto the bridge to investigate, the bolts and supports of the bridge strain. The bridge comes apart, and John realizes that the prophesied tragedy on the Ohio River was about the bridge. As the bridge collapses, Officer Mills' car falls into the water. John jumps in after her and pulls her from the river and up to safety. As the two sit on the back of an ambulance, they see that 36 people have been killed, making Connie the \"number 37\" from her dream. The cause of the bridge collapse was never fully determined. Although the Mothman has been sighted in other parts of the world, it was never seen again in Point Pleasant.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Richardgere.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Lead actor Richard Gere who portrayed the protagonist John Klein.]]\n* [[Richard Gere]] as John Klein\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Connie Mills\n* [[Will Patton]] as Gordon Smallwood\n* [[Debra Messing]] as Mary Klein\n* [[Lucinda Jenney]] as Denise Smallwood\n* [[Alan Bates]] as Alexander Leek\n* [[David Eigenberg]] as Ed Fleischman\n* Bob Tracey as Cyrus Bills\n* [[Mark Pellington]] as Indrid Cold \"The Mothman\" (voice)\n\n==Themes and interpretations==\n[[File:Mothman2.jpg |200px |left |thumb |Film critics have interpreted the film's portrayal of [[Mothman]] as demonic.]]\nWriter Paul Meehan judged the film's explanation of the Mothman to be a \"confused mish-mosh of [[science fiction]] and [[demonology]]\" and likened it to the television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', though preserving Keel's \"breathless hysteria\".{{sfn|Meehan|2009|p=130}} Meehan remarked that \"Aliens spouting prophetic utterances are rare in UFO literature\".{{sfn|Meehan|2009|p=130}}\n\nIn contrast to Meehan, author Jason Horsley declared ''The Mothman Prophecies'' \"probably the most effective depiction of demonic forces at work\" in U.S. cinema.{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=197}} Horsley assessed its approach to the Mothman legend as depicting a \"schizophrenic nature of reality\", fulfilling a \"revelation\" purpose in [[horror film]], as it \"strips away the comfortable veneer of consensus reality to reveal the seething abyss of irrationality\".{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=197}} Horsley argued the film's Mothman arrives from a foreign dimension, but being without \"physical existence\", it is also a product of the minds of Point Pleasant's citizens, based on \"formless and impersonal energy\".{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=198}} The Mothman, identified by Horsley as \"emissary of the [[Id, ego and super-ego|Id]]\", is depicted in the film as being as natural as electricity or gravity.{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=198}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Carl Franklin]] was originally attached to direct Richard Hatem's [[spec script]] before [[Mark Pellington]] was hired.<ref>{{cite news|author=Petrikin, Chris|title=Fox puts Armitage in Doud\u2019s \u2018Body\u2019|url=https://variety.com/1999/film/news/fox-puts-armitage-in-doud-s-body-1117500041/|work=Variety|date=May 5, 1999|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}</ref> Pellington rejected numerous screenplay drafts as literal interpretations of Keel's book, and wished to explore psychological drama in UFO witnesses.<ref name=\"Rickard\">{{cite web|last=Rickard |first=Bob |title=The moth man cometh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/22/artsfeatures3 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 22, 2002 |accessdate=August 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn reality, 46 people died in the collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]], not 36 as depicted in the film. The motion picture's claim at the end credits of the collapse of the Silver Bridge never being explained is false; the incident was found to be caused by the failure of an [[Eyebar|eye-bar]] in a suspension chain in 1971, well before the publication of the book on which the film is based, let alone the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=cJ1eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MVMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4537,3056163|newspaper=The Portsmouth Times|date=28 May 1976|page=12|title=Claims In Disaster Denied}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/wvhs1504.html |title=The Collapse of the Silver Bridge-by Chris LeRose |publisher=Wvculture.org |accessdate=2009-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830051225/http://www.wvculture.org/history/wvhs1504.html |archivedate=2013-08-30 }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Image:Kittanning Citizen's Bridge.JPG|thumb|200px|Kittanning Citizens Bridge]]\nAside from a few opening scenes filmed in [[Washington, D.C.]], most of the motion picture was filmed in the areas of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] and [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania|Kittanning]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. The scenes of Gere sitting on a park bench are on the [[University of Pittsburgh]] campus.{{sfn|Tiech|2014|p=72}} Road montages were filmed on [[Pennsylvania Route 28]], and the [[Chicago]] scenes are completely shot in downtown Pittsburgh\u2019s [[Mellon Square]] and Trinity Churchyard environs as well as the entrance to the Duquesne Club. The \"Chemical Plant\" featured in the movie is actually a power station owned by Reliant Energy in Elrama, Pennsylvania. The Avalon Motor Inn is in [[Eighty Four, Pennsylvania]], though scenes set indoors were built as separate sets, as the inn's atmosphere could not accommodate production.{{sfn|Tiech|2014|p=73}} Point Pleasant scenes were shot in [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania]].  The hospital scenes were filmed at St. Frances Medical Center which is now the site of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. \nThe collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]] was actually filmed at the [[Kittanning Citizens Bridge]] in downtown Kittanning. Scenes shot at Gordon Smallwood\u2019s house were filmed in Washington County on [[Pennsylvania Route 917]]. Pittsburgh\u2019s [[Allegheny County Airport]] serves as backdrop for the airfield scenes. Despite this relocation, several police officers from Point Pleasant appeared as extras.<ref>{{cite web |author=Spiderweb 2000 Solutions |url=http://www.mothmanmuseum.com/MothmanLives/mothmanmovie/register/pointpleasantregister1.html |title=Point Pleasant Register \u2013 Mothman |publisher=Mothmanmuseum.com |accessdate=2009-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717004446/http://www.mothmanmuseum.com/MothmanLives/mothmanmovie/register/pointpleasantregister1.html |archivedate=2009-07-17 }}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe film's musical score was composed by the creative lab [[tomandandy]].

Based on the 1975 [[The Mothman Prophecies|book of the same name]] by [[parapsychology|parapsychologist]] and [[Charles Fort|Fortean]] author [[John Keel]], the screenplay was written by [[Richard Hatem]]. \n\nThe story follows John Klein (Gere), a reporter who researches the legend of the [[Mothman]]. Still shaken by the death of his wife, two years earlier in a mysterious accident. Klein is sent to cover a news piece and ends up inexplicably finding himself in [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia]], where there have been sightings of an unusual creature and other unexplained phenomena. As he becomes increasingly drawn into mysterious forces at work, he hopes they can reconnect him to his wife, while the local sheriff (Linney) becomes concerned about his obsessions.\n\nThe film claims to be based on actual events that occurred between November 1966 and December 1967 in Point Pleasant, as described by Keel. It was shot in  [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania]] and was released to mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist John Klein and his wife Mary are involved in an accident when Mary swerves to avoid a black, flying figure. John survives the crash unscathed, but Mary is hospitalized. After Mary dies of an unrelated [[glioblastoma|brain tumor]], John discovers mysterious drawings of the creature that she had created whilst in hospital.\n\nTwo years later, John becomes lost in [[West Virginia]] and inexplicably finds himself in [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia|Point Pleasant]], hundreds of miles off his route. Driving in the middle of the night, his car breaks down; and he walks to a nearby house to get help. The owner, Gordon Smallwood, reacts violently to John's appearance and holds him at gunpoint. Local police officer Connie Mills defuses the situation while Gordon explains that this is the third consecutive night John has knocked on his door at 2:30 AM, asking to use a phone, much to John's confusion. John stays at a local motel and considers how he ended up so far from his original destination.\n\nOfficer Mills mentions to John that many strange things have been occurring in the past few weeks and that people report seeing a large winged creature like a giant [[moth]] with red eyes. She also tells John about a strange dream she had, in which the words \"Wake up, Number 37\" were spoken to her. During a conversation one day, Gordon reveals to John that he has heard voices coming from his sink telling him that, in [[Denver]], \"99 will die\". While discussing the day's events at a local diner, John notices that the news is showing the story of an airplane crash in Denver that killed all 99 passengers aboard. The next night Gordon frantically explains that the voices in his head emanate from a being named Indrid Cold.\n\nLater that night Gordon calls John and says that he is standing next to someone named Indrid Cold. While John keeps Cold on the line, Officer Mills checks on Gordon. Cold answers John's questions, including ones he could not possibly know the answers to, convincing John that Cold is a supernatural being. This episode starts a string of supernatural calls to John's motel room. One tells him that there will be a great tragedy on the [[Ohio River]]. Later John receives a call from Gordon and rushes to his home to check on him. He finds Gordon outside, dead from [[Hypothermia|exposure]].\n\nJohn becomes obsessed with the being dubbed the Mothman. He meets an expert on the subject, Alexander Leek, who explains its nature and discourages John from becoming further involved. However, when John learns the [[Governor of West Virginia|Governor]] plans to tour a chemical plant located on the Ohio River the following day, he becomes convinced the tragedy will occur there. Officer Mills and the governor ignore his warnings, and nothing happens during the tour. Soon afterwards, John receives a mysterious message that instructs him to await a call from his deceased wife Mary back in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], and he returns home.\n\nOn [[Christmas Eve]], Officer Mills calls and convinces him to ignore the phone call from \"Mary\", return to Point Pleasant, and join her. Though anguished, John agrees. As John reaches the [[Silver Bridge]], a malfunctioning traffic light causes traffic congestion. As John walks onto the bridge to investigate, the bolts and supports of the bridge strain. The bridge comes apart, and John realizes that the prophesied tragedy on the Ohio River was about the bridge. As the bridge collapses, Officer Mills' car falls into the water. John jumps in after her and pulls her from the river and up to safety. As the two sit on the back of an ambulance, they see that 36 people have been killed, making Connie the \"number 37\" from her dream. The cause of the bridge collapse was never fully determined. Although the Mothman has been sighted in other parts of the world, it was never seen again in Point Pleasant.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Richardgere.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Lead actor Richard Gere who portrayed the protagonist John Klein.]]\n* [[Richard Gere]] as John Klein\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Connie Mills\n* [[Will Patton]] as Gordon Smallwood\n* [[Debra Messing]] as Mary Klein\n* [[Lucinda Jenney]] as Denise Smallwood\n* [[Alan Bates]] as Alexander Leek\n* [[David Eigenberg]] as Ed Fleischman\n* Bob Tracey as Cyrus Bills\n* [[Mark Pellington]] as Indrid Cold \"The Mothman\" (voice)\n\n==Themes and interpretations==\n[[File:Mothman2.jpg |200px |left |thumb |Film critics have interpreted the film's portrayal of [[Mothman]] as demonic.]]\nWriter Paul Meehan judged the film's explanation of the Mothman to be a \"confused mish-mosh of [[science fiction]] and [[demonology]]\" and likened it to the television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', though preserving Keel's \"breathless hysteria\".{{sfn|Meehan|2009|p=130}} Meehan remarked that \"Aliens spouting prophetic utterances are rare in UFO literature\".{{sfn|Meehan|2009|p=130}}\n\nIn contrast to Meehan, author Jason Horsley declared ''The Mothman Prophecies'' \"probably the most effective depiction of demonic forces at work\" in U.S. cinema.{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=197}} Horsley assessed its approach to the Mothman legend as depicting a \"schizophrenic nature of reality\", fulfilling a \"revelation\" purpose in [[horror film]], as it \"strips away the comfortable veneer of consensus reality to reveal the seething abyss of irrationality\".{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=197}} Horsley argued the film's Mothman arrives from a foreign dimension, but being without \"physical existence\", it is also a product of the minds of Point Pleasant's citizens, based on \"formless and impersonal energy\".{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=198}} The Mothman, identified by Horsley as \"emissary of the [[Id, ego and super-ego|Id]]\", is depicted in the film as being as natural as electricity or gravity.{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=198}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Carl Franklin]] was originally attached to direct Richard Hatem's [[spec script]] before [[Mark Pellington]] was hired.<ref>{{cite news|author=Petrikin, Chris|title=Fox puts Armitage in Doud\u2019s \u2018Body\u2019|url=https://variety.com/1999/film/news/fox-puts-armitage-in-doud-s-body-1117500041/|work=Variety|date=May 5, 1999|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}</ref> Pellington rejected numerous screenplay drafts as literal interpretations of Keel's book, and wished to explore psychological drama in UFO witnesses.<ref name=\"Rickard\">{{cite web|last=Rickard |first=Bob |title=The moth man cometh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/22/artsfeatures3 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 22, 2002 |accessdate=August 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn reality, 46 people died in the collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]], not 36 as depicted in the film.

The scenes of Gere sitting on a park bench are on the [[University of Pittsburgh]] campus.{{sfn|Tiech|2014|p=72}} Road montages were filmed on [[Pennsylvania Route 28]], and the [[Chicago]] scenes are completely shot in downtown Pittsburgh\u2019s [[Mellon Square]] and Trinity Churchyard environs as well as the entrance to the Duquesne Club. The \"Chemical Plant\" featured in the movie is actually a power station owned by Reliant Energy in Elrama, Pennsylvania. The Avalon Motor Inn is in [[Eighty Four, Pennsylvania]], though scenes set indoors were built as separate sets, as the inn's atmosphere could not accommodate production.{{sfn|Tiech|2014|p=73}} Point Pleasant scenes were shot in [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania]].  The hospital scenes were filmed at St. Frances Medical Center which is now the site of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. \nThe collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]] was actually filmed at the [[Kittanning Citizens Bridge]] in downtown Kittanning. Scenes shot at Gordon Smallwood\u2019s house were filmed in Washington County on [[Pennsylvania Route 917]]. Pittsburgh\u2019s [[Allegheny County Airport]] serves as backdrop for the airfield scenes.
