Starrs found a large hematoma on the left side of Olson's head and a large injury on his chest. Most of the team concluded that the blunt-force trauma to the head and the injury to the chest had not occurred during the fall, but most likely in the room before the fall (one team member dissented).<ref name=Ignatieff-2001/> Starrs called the evidence \"rankly and starkly suggestive of [[homicide]].\"<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\nIn 1996, Eric approached the [[U.S. District Attorney]] in Manhattan, [[Robert Morgenthau]], to see if his office would open a new investigation.

Proteins perform a variety of critical functions as [[enzyme]]s, structural proteins or [[hormone]]s and therefore, are crucial biological components. As a result, protein synthesis is regulated at multiple steps <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\">{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |date=2015 |publisher=Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group |location=Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0815344643 |edition=  Sixth}}</ref>. Protein synthesis is a very similar process for both [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s but there are some distinct differences.\n\nProtein synthesis can be divided broadly into two phases - [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. During transcription, a section of [[DNA]] encoding a protein, known as a [[gene]], is converted into a template molecule [[messenger RNA]] by enzymes - called [[RNA polymerases]] - in the nucleus of the cell <ref name=\"O'Connor 2010\">{{cite book |last1=O'Connor |first1=Clare |title=Essentials of Cell Biology |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge, MA |location=NPG Education |url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/essentials-of-cell-biology-14749010/ |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref>. In eukaryotes, this messenger RNA (mRNA) is initially produced in a premature form which undergoes processing and modification through post-transcriptional modifications. The now mature mRNA is exported from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] via [[nuclear pore]]s to the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell for translation to occur. During translation, the messenger RNA is read by [[ribosome]]s in the cytoplasm and the [[nucleotide]] sequence of the mRNA is used to determine the sequence of [[amino acid]]s. The amino acids are joined together by [[covalent bond|covalent]] [[peptide bond]]s to form a polypeptide chain.\n\nFollowing translation the polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein, for example, a protein must fold correctly to produce a functional [[active site]] required to function as an enzyme. In order to adopt a functional 3D shape, known as the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]], the polypeptide chain must adopt a series of smaller underlying structures called [[protein secondary structure|secondary structures]]. When the polypeptide chain has correctly folded, the protein can undergo further maturation through different [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications can alter the protein's ability to function, where it is located within the cell (e.g. cytoplasm or nucleus) and the protein's ability to [[protein-protein interaction|interact with other proteins]] <ref name =\"Wang 2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|pmid=24217768 |pmc=3915910 }}</ref>.\n\nProtein biosynthesis has a key role in disease, as changes and errors in this process through underlying [[mutation|DNA mutations]] or protein misfolding are often the underlying causes of a disease. DNA mutations change the subsequent mRNA sequence, which then alters the mRNA encoded amino acid sequence. [[Nonsense mutation|Mutations can cause the polypeptide chain to be shorter]] by generating a [[stop codon|short stop sequence]] which causes early termination of translation.

In eukaryotes, this mRNA molecule is known as pre-mRNA as it undergoes post-transcriptional processing in the nucleus to produce a mature mRNA molecule. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so the mature mRNA molecule is immediately produced by transcription.\n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, complementary [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s between the base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA - corresponding to a gene - to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand. \n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the start of the gene (known as the [[Directionality (molecular biology)|3-prime]] (3') end) to the end of the gene (called the 5-prime (5') end). Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand. The pre-mRNA molecule is built by the addition of nucleotides using a [[phosphodiester bond]] to the growing polynucleotide chain by RNA polymerase as it moves along the DNA template strand. Behind the RNA polymerase the two strands of DNA rejoin, so only 12 base pairs on the DNA are exposed at a time <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level. Student book |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Great Clarendon Street, Oxford, OX2 6DP, UK |isbn=9780198351771 |edition=  Second}}</ref>.\n\nThe pre-mRNA molecule synthesised is complementary in sequence to the template DNA strand and shares the same nucleotide sequence as the coding DNA strand. However, there is one crucial difference in the nucleotide composition of DNA and mRNA molecules. DNA is composed of 4 bases - [[guanine]], [[cytosine]], [[adenine]] and [[thymine]] (G, C, A and T) - RNA is also composed of 4 bases - guanine, cytosine, adenine and [[uracil]]. In RNA molecules, the DNA base thymine is replaced by uracil, therefore, in the pre-mRNA molecule, all complementary bases which would be thymine in the coding DNA strand are replaced by uracil <ref name=\"Berk2000\">{{cite book |last1=Berk |first1=Arnold |last2=Lodish |first2=Harvey |last3=Darnell |first3=James E |title=Molecular cell biology |date=2000 |publisher=W.H.

The purpose of the 5' cap is to prevent pre-mRNA and mature mRNA molecules being broken down in the cell before they are translated, the cap also aids binding of the ribosome to the mRNA to start translation. In contrast, the 3' Poly(A) tail is added to the 3' end of the mRNA molecule.

In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, the processes of transcription and translation both occur in the cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020\">{{cite web |title=Stages of translation (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/the-stages-of-translation |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Ribosome]]s are complex [[molecular machine]]s, made of a mixture of protein and RNA, arranged into two subunit (a large and small subunit), which surround the mRNA molecule.

Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides within the molecule.<ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=  2nd}}</ref> There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, which serve as adaptors in this process, each binds to a specific nucleotide sequence (known as a [[codon]]) in the mRNA molecule and delivering a specific amino acid.\n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the mRNA molecule using codon-anticodon base pairing. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its enzymatic activity [[peptidyl transferase]] to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids.<ref name=\"Toole2015\"/>\n\nThe ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon, releasing the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains.<ref name=\"Toole2015\"/> Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\"/>.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of protein folding from primary structure through to quaternary structure]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function.\n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the secondary structure of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the tertiary structure of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\n==Post-translational modifications==\nCompletion of protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing in the form of post-translation modifications. There are over 200 known types of post-translation modification which can occur, these modifications can alter protein activity, the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins and where the protein is found within the cell e.g. in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Duan 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=Guangyou |last2=Walther |first2=Dirk |last3=Radivojac |first3=Predrag |title=The Roles of Post-translational Modifications in the Context of Protein Interaction Networks |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |date=2015 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=e1004049 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004049|doi-access=free }}</ref> Through post-translational modification, the diversity of proteins encoded by the genome is expanded by 2 to 3 [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] <ref name=\"Schubert 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Schubert |first1=Mario |last2=Walczak |first2=Michal J. |last3=Aebi |first3=Markus |last4=Wider |first4=Gerhard |title=Posttranslational Modifications of Intact Proteins Detected by NMR Spectroscopy: Application to Glycosylation |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |date=2015 |volume=54 |issue=24 |pages=7096\u20137100 |doi=10.1002/anie.201502093}}</ref>.\n\nThere are four key types of post-translational modification:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n# Cleavage\n# Addition of chemical groups\n# Addition of complex molecules\n# Formation of intramolecular bonds\n\n===Cleavage===\n[[Proteolysis|Cleavage]] of proteins is an irreversible post-translational modification carried out by enzymes known as [[proteases]].

Phosphorylation can drive proteins to interact with other proteins to produce a large, multi-protein complex <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n===Addition of complex molecules===\nPost-translational modification can incorporate more complex, larger molecules into the mature protein structure by covalently adding the molecule onto amino acids within the polypeptide chain. One common example of this is [[glycosylation]], which is widely considered to be most common post-translational modification.<ref name=\"Schubert 2015\"/>\n\nIn glycosylation, a polysaccharide molecule (known as a [[glycan]]) is covalently added to a protein by enzymes known as [[glycosyltransferases]] and [[glycoside hydrolases|glycosidases]] in the cytoplasmic organelles the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus]]. Glycosylation can have a critical role in determining the final, folded 3D structure of target protein - in some cases glycosylation of the protein is necessary for correct folding. N-linked glycosylation promotes protein folding by increasing [[solubility]] and mediates the protein binding to [[chaperone (protein)|chaperones]].<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\nThere are broadly two types of glycosylation, [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]]. N-linked glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the addition of a precursor glycan. The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently bound to the nitrogen atom on an [[asparagine]] amino acid within the polypeptide chain. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the covalent sequential addition of individual sugars onto the oxygen atom in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure.<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\n===Formation of covalent bonds===\n[[File:Formation of disulphide covalent bonds.png|300px|thumb|Shows the formation of disulphide covalent bonds as a post-translational modification. Disulphide bonds can either form within a single polypeptide chain (left) or between polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit protein complex (right)]]\nMany proteins produced within the cell are secreted outside of the cell, therefore, these proteins function as [[extracellular]] proteins. Extracellular proteins are exposed to a variety of conditions outside the cell. In order to stabilise the functional, 3D structure of the protein, covalent bonds are formed either within the protein or between the different polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit complex. The most prevalent type of covalent bond is a [[disulfide|disulfide bond]] (also known as a disulfide bridge). A disulphide bond is formed between two [[cysteine]] amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a sulphur atom, known as [[thiol]] functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilise the [[protein structure|pre-existing conformation]] of protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidising environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the oxidising environment of the endoplasmic reticulum catalysed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases. Disulfide bonds are rarely formed in the cytoplasm as it is a reducing environment.<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\n==Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease==\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease.

This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility.

In eukaryotes, this RNA molecule is known as pre-mRNA as it undergoes post-transcriptional processing to produce a mature mRNA molecule. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so the mature mRNA molecule is immediately produced.\n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, [[Complementary (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s between the base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA - corresponding to a gene - to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand.\n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] then binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the [[Directionality (molecular biology|3-prime]] (3') end to the [[Directionality (molecular biology|5-prime]] (5') end. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair]]ing with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand.

In RNA molecules, the DNA base thymine is replaced by uracil, therefore, in the pre-mRNA molecule, all complementary bases which would be thymines are replaced by uracil.<ref name=\"Berk2000\">{{cite book |last1=Berk |first1=Arnold |last2=Lodish |first2=Harvey |last3=Darnell |first3=James E |title=Molecular cell biology |date=2000 |publisher=W.H.

Genes are composed of a series of introns and [[exon]]s, introns are nucleotide sequences within the gene that do not encode the protein while, exons are nucleotide sequences which directly encode a protein. Introns and exons are present in both the underlying DNA sequence and the pre-mRNA molecule but are removed by splicing to produce the final mRNA molecule. This mature mRNA molecule is then exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm through nuclear pores in the envelope of the nucleus.\n\n==Translation==\n{{main|Translation (biology)}}\n[[File:Translation - cycle.png|450px|thumb|Translation process showing the cycle of tRNA addition and amino acid incorporation into the growing polypeptide chain]]\n[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px|right| A [[ribosome]] is a [[biological machine]] that utilizes [[protein dynamics]] on [[nanoscale]]s]]\n\nTranslation is the process of synthesising an amino acid polypeptide chain from the mRNA template molecule. In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, the processes of transcription and translation both occur in the cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020\">{{cite web |title=Stages of translation (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/the-stages-of-translation |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Ribosome]]s are complex [[molecular machine]]s, made of a mixture of protein and RNA, arranged into two subunit (a large and small subunit), which surround the mRNA molecule. The ribosome reads the mRNA molecule in a 5'-3' direction and uses the mRNA as a template to determine the order of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.<ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020 - 2\">{{cite web |title=Nucleus and ribosomes (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/structure-of-a-cell/prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-cells/a/nucleus-and-ribosomes |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules known as [[transfer RNA]]s (tRNA) to bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides within the molecule.<ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=  2nd}}</ref> There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, which serve as adaptors in this process, each binds to a specific nucleotide sequence (known as a [[codon]]) in the mRNA molecule and delivering a specific amino acid.\n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the mRNA molecule using codon-anticodon base pairing. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its enzymatic activity [[peptidyl transferase]] to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids.<ref name=\"Toole2015\"/>\n\nThe ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon, releasing the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains.<ref name=\"Toole2015\"/> Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome.<ref name=\"Cooper 2000\"/>\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of protein folding from primary structure through to quaternary structure]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function.\n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the [[protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits.<ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Post-translational modifications==\nCompletion of protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing in the form of post-translation modifications. There are over 200 known types of post-translation modification which can occur, these modifications can alter protein activity, the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins and where the protein is found within the cell e.g. in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Duan 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=Guangyou |last2=Walther |first2=Dirk |last3=Radivojac |first3=Predrag |title=The Roles of Post-translational Modifications in the Context of Protein Interaction Networks |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |date=2015 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=e1004049 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004049|doi-access=free }}</ref> Through post-translational modification, the diversity of proteins encoded by the genome is expanded by 2 to 3 [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]].<ref name=\"Schubert 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Schubert |first1=Mario |last2=Walczak |first2=Michal J. |last3=Aebi |first3=Markus |last4=Wider |first4=Gerhard |title=Posttranslational Modifications of Intact Proteins Detected by NMR Spectroscopy: Application to Glycosylation |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |date=2015 |volume=54 |issue=24 |pages=7096\u20137100 |doi=10.1002/anie.201502093}}</ref>\n\nThere are four key types of post-translational modification:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n# Cleavage\n# Addition of chemical groups\n# Addition of complex molecules\n# Formation of intramolecular bonds\n\n===Cleavage===\n[[Proteolysis|Cleavage]] of proteins is an irreversible post-translational modification carried out by enzymes known as [[proteases]].

Methylation occurs on at least 9 of the 20 common amino acids, however, it mainly occurs on the amino acids [[lysine]] and [[arginine]].

Phosphorylation is the reversible, covalent addition of a [[phosphate]] group to specific amino acids within the protein, mainly [[serine]], [[threonine]] and [[tyrosine]], by a protein [[kinase]]. Phosphorylation can drive proteins to interact with other proteins to produce a large, multi-protein complex.<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\n===Addition of complex molecules===\nPost-translational modification can incorporate more complex, larger molecules into the mature protein structure by covalently adding the molecule onto amino acids within the polypeptide chain. One common example of this is [[glycosylation]], which is widely considered to be most common post-translational modification.<ref name=\"Schubert 2015\"/>\n\nIn glycosylation, a polysaccharide molecule (known as a [[glycan]]) is covalently added to a protein by enzymes known as [[glycosyltransferases]] and [[glycoside hydrolases|glycosidases]] in the cytoplasmic organelles the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus]]. Glycosylation can have a critical role in determining the final, folded 3D structure of target protein - in some cases glycosylation of the protein is necessary for correct folding. N-linked glycosylation promotes protein folding by increasing [[solubility]] and mediates the protein binding to [[chaperone (protein)|chaperones]].<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\nThere are broadly two types of glycosylation, [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]]. N-linked glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the addition of a precursor glycan. The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently bound to the nitrogen atom on an [[asparagine]] amino acid within the polypeptide chain. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the covalent sequential addition of individual sugars onto the oxygen atom in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure.<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\n===Formation of covalent bonds===\n[[File:Formation of disulphide covalent bonds.png|300px|thumb|Shows the formation of disulphide covalent bonds as a post-translational modification. Disulphide bonds can either form within a single polypeptide chain (left) or between polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit protein complex (right)]]\nMany proteins produced within the cell are secreted outside of the cell, therefore, these proteins function as [[extracellular]] proteins. Extracellular proteins are exposed to a variety of conditions outside the cell. In order to stabilise the functional, 3D structure of the protein, covalent bonds are formed either within the protein or between the different polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit complex. The most prevalent type of covalent bond is a [[disulfide|disulfide bond]] (also known as a disulfide bridge). A disulphide bond is formed between two [[cysteine]] amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a sulphur atom, known as [[thiol]] functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilise the [[protein structure|pre-existing conformation]] of protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidising environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the oxidising environment of the endoplasmic reticulum catalysed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases. Disulfide bonds are rarely formed in the cytoplasm as it is a reducing environment.<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\n==Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease==\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease. Haemoglobin is composed of four subunits - two A subunits and two B subunits.<ref name=\"Steinberg 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Habara |first1=Alawi |last2=Steinberg |first2=Martin H |title=Minireview: Genetic basis of heterogeneity and severity in sickle cell disease |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=March 2016 |volume=241 |issue=7 |pages=689\u2013696 |doi=10.1177/1535370216636726 |pmid=26936084 |pmc=4950383 }}</ref> Patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia have a missense mutation in the haemoglobin B subunit gene. A missense mutation means the nucleotide mutation alters the overall codon triplet such that a different amino acid is paired with the new codon.

When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility. This rigid, distorted red blood cell can aggregate in blood vessels creating a blockage. The blockage prevents blood flow to the tissue and can lead to [[tissue death|necrosis]] which causes pain to the individual.<ref name=\"Ilesanmi 2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Ilesanmi |first1=Oluwatoyin Olatundun |title=Pathological basis of symptoms and crises in sickle cell disorder: implications for counseling and psychotherapy |journal=Hematology Reports |date=2010 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2 |doi=10.4081/hr.2010.e2|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Central dogma of molecular biology]]\n*[[Genetic code]]\n*[[Gene expression]]\n*[[Post-translational modification]]\n*[[Protein folding]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA A useful video visualising the process of converting DNA to protein via transcription and translation]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hok2hyED9go Video visualising the process of protein folding from the non-functional primary structure to a mature, folded 3D protein structure with reference to the role of mutations and protein mis-folding in disease]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2bGjTaNsnM A more advanced video detailing the different types of post-translational modifications and their chemical structures]\n\n{{Protein primary structure}}\n{{protein biosynthesis}}{{Protein topics}}\n\n{{portal bar|Metabolism}}\n\n[[Category:Gene expression]]\n[[Category:Proteins]]\n[[Category:Biosynthesis]]\n[[Category:Metabolism]]\n[[Category:Protein biosynthesis| ]]\n", "name_user": "Kep17", "label": "safe", "comment": "Edits to lead section, transcription and post-transcriptional modification sections", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis"}

It is located near the border with the [[Netherlands]], approx. 10&nbsp;km east of [[Enschede]]. It is part of the town [[Gronau, North Rhine-Westphalia|Gronau]].\n\n[[File:Brinkerhook, straatzicht foto7 2016-04-03 16.07.jpg|Brinkerhook, landscape |thumb|left]]\n\n== Local History ==\nAlready in the time between 2000 and 1700 B.C. a settlement of the Eper area can be proven. Findings of weapons, jewellery and pottery bear witness to this Neolithic settlement. The finds can be found in the museum in M\u00fcnster.\n\nThe church, built around 1175, was probably a stone building. The baptismal font from this period, which is still preserved today, indicates this. The church seems to have stood on the floor of the Epe courtyard and was therefore a church of its own.\n\nIn 1188 the village Epe was mentioned for the first time in the list of goods of Count Dale zu Diepenheim (today in the Rijksarchief Utrecht). The count owned one third of the church patronage. The name Epe is derived from the Ur-Germanic Apa (\"place at the river/water\").\n\nIn 1325 the manor house 'Droste W\u00fcllen Epe' was first mentioned in a document. It was in the possession of the lords of Keppel zu Nienborg, who had the patronage right over the parish for a long time. Heinrich von W\u00fcllen was enfeoffed with the court of Epe in 1380. Thus the house became W\u00fcllen. It was located near to the Dinkel (today Schepers M\u00fchle).\n\nIn 1400 the first mention of farm communities in the districts Lange Seite and the Gerdingseite took place. Ten years later Herr von Plettenberg expanded and embellished Epe. During the Eighty Years' War fires broke out in 1583, 1588 and 1593.\n\n1803 Epe fell according to the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss to the county Salm-Horstmar. In 1806 Epe came to the Grand Duchy of Berg under Napoleon I's brother-in-law Murat and in 1811 fell to the Empire of France. As a result of the wars of liberation and the resolutions at the Congress of Vienna, Epe became Prussian in 1815. In 1882 a fire destroyed most of the town. In 1886 the former church Saint Agatha collapsed. In this emergency no persons were injured. \n\nIn 1875 the railway line from Gronau via Epe to Dortmund was opened. 1881 saw the foundation of the first textile factory, the weaving mill of Gebr.

It is located near the border with the [[Netherlands]], approx. 10&nbsp;km east of [[Enschede]]. It is part of the town [[Gronau, North Rhine-Westphalia|Gronau]].\n\n[[File:Epe, die katholische Kirche Sankt Agatha Dm15 foto9 2016-04-03 16.35.jpg|View to Gronauer-Str. and catholic church: Sankt Agatha|left|280px|thumb]]\n[[File:Brinkerhook, straatzicht foto7 2016-04-03 16.07.jpg|Brinkerhook, landscape |thumb|340px|center]]<br />\n== Local History ==\nAlready in the time between 2000 and 1700 B.C. a settlement of the Eper area can be proven. Findings of weapons, jewellery and pottery bear witness to this Neolithic settlement. The finds can be found in the museum in M\u00fcnster.\n\nThe church, built around 1175, was probably a stone building. The baptismal font from this period, which is still preserved today, indicates this. The church seems to have stood on the floor of the Epe courtyard and was therefore a church of its own.\n\nIn 1188 the village Epe was mentioned for the first time in the list of goods of Count Dale zu Diepenheim (today in the Rijksarchief Utrecht). The count owned one third of the church patronage. The name Epe is derived from the Ur-Germanic Apa (\"place at the river/water\").\n\nIn 1325 the manor house 'Droste W\u00fcllen Epe' was first mentioned in a document. It was in the possession of the lords of Keppel zu Nienborg, who had the patronage right over the parish for a long time. Heinrich von W\u00fcllen was enfeoffed with the court of Epe in 1380. Thus the house became W\u00fcllen. It was located near to the Dinkel (today Schepers M\u00fchle).\n\nIn 1400 the first mention of farm communities in the districts Lange Seite and the Gerdingseite took place. Ten years later Herr von Plettenberg expanded and embellished Epe. During the Eighty Years' War fires broke out in 1583, 1588 and 1593.\n\n1803 Epe fell according to the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss to the county Salm-Horstmar. In 1806 Epe came to the Grand Duchy of Berg under Napoleon I's brother-in-law Murat and in 1811 fell to the Empire of France. As a result of the wars of liberation and the resolutions at the Congress of Vienna, Epe became Prussian in 1815. In 1882 a fire destroyed most of the town. In 1886 the former church Saint Agatha collapsed. In this emergency no persons were injured. \n\nIn 1875 the railway line from Gronau via Epe to Dortmund was opened. 1881 saw the foundation of the first textile factory, the weaving mill of Gebr. Laurenz from Ochtrup, with 500 mechanical looms. A spinning mill was put into operation in 1904/1905. This was followed by a dyeing plant. The factory was closed in 1967.\n\nThe \u2018Germania Epe\u2019 cotton spinning mill was founded in 1897 by the Jannink family from Enschede NL.\u00a0 Plant II was put into operation in 1910.
