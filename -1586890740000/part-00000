Many men, some the very young and old, were killed resisting or trying to escape. Once collected, they would be roped or chained together and marched, with little food or water, long distances to camp. They often died or were killed along the way, sometimes less than 50 percent reaching camp alive. Then recruit camp was no better, with hospitals resembling Nazi concentration camps... Probably 3,081,000 died during the Sino-Japanese War; likely another 1,131,000 during the Civil War\u20144,212,000 dead in total.

That same year, efforts were taken by Allied high commanders to suppress \"take no prisoners\" attitudes,<ref name=Ferguson2004/> among their own personnel (as these were affecting intelligence gathering) and to encourage Japanese soldiers to surrender. Ferguson adds that measures by Allied commanders to improve the ratio of Japanese prisoners to Japanese dead, resulted in it reaching 1:7, by mid-1945. Nevertheless, taking no prisoners was still standard practice among US troops at the [[Battle of Okinawa]], in April\u2013June 1945.<ref name=Ferguson2004/>\n\n[[Ulrich A.

The article goes deeper into the matter and claims that the villagers' tale - true or not - is part of a 'dark, long-kept secret' the unraveling of which 'refocused attention on what historians say is one of the most widely ignored crimes of the war': \"the widespread rape of Okinawan women by American servicemen\".<ref>{{Cite news|last = Sims |first = Calvin |date = 1 June 2000 |title = 3 Dead Marines and a Secret of Wartime Okinawa |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/01/world/3-dead-marines-and-a-secret-of-wartime-okinawa.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=Nago, Japan |access-date=6 April 2015 |quote= Still, the villagers' tale of a dark, long-kept secret has refocused attention on what historians say is one of the most widely ignored crimes of the war, the widespread rape of Okinawan women by American servicemen.}}</ref> Although Japanese reports of rape were largely ignored at the time, academic estimates have been that as many as 10,000 Okinawan women may have been raped. It has been claimed that the rape was so prevalent that most Okinawans over age 65 around the year 2000 either knew or had heard of a woman who was raped in the aftermath of the war. Military officials denied the mass rapings, and all surviving veterans refused ''The New York Times''' request for an interview.<ref name=\"okinawa\">{{Cite news|last = Sims |first = Calvin |date = 1 June 2000 |title = 3 Dead Marines and a Secret of Wartime Okinawa |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/01/world/3-dead-marines-and-a-secret-of-wartime-okinawa.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=Nago, Japan |access-date=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nProfessor of East Asian Studies and expert on Okinawa Steve Rabson said: \"I have read many accounts of such rapes in Okinawan newspapers and books, but few people know about them or are willing to talk about them\". Books, diaries, articles and other documents refer to rapes by American soldiers of various races and backgrounds. Samuel Saxton, a retired captain, explained that the American veterans and witnesses may have believed: \"It would be unfair for the public to get the impression that we were all a bunch of rapists after we worked so hard to serve our country\". Masaie Ishihara, a sociology professor, supports this: \"There is a lot of historical amnesia out there, many people don't want to acknowledge what really happened\".<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nAn explanation given for why the US military has no record of any rapes is that few - if any - Okinawan women reported abuse, mostly out of fear and embarrassment. Those who did report them are believed by historians to have been ignored by the US military police. A large scale effort to determine the extent of such crimes has also never been called for. Over five decades after the war has ended the women who were believed to have been raped still refused to give a public statement, with friends, local historians and university professors who had spoken with the women instead saying they preferred not to discuss it publicly. According to a [[Nago, Okinawa]]n police spokesman: \"Victimized women feel too ashamed to make it public\".<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nIn his book \"Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb\", George Feifer noted that by 1946 there had been fewer than 10 reported cases of rape in Okinawa. He explains that it was: \"partly because of shame and disgrace, partly because Americans were victors and occupiers\". Feifer claimed: \"In all there were probably thousands of incidents, but the victims' silence kept rape another dirty secret of the campaign.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Feifer |first=George |date=1992 |title=Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb |location=Michigan |publisher=Ticknor & Fields |isbn=9780395599242 |url=https://archive.org/details/tennozanbattleof00feif }}</ref> Many people wondered why it never came to light after the inevitable American-Japanese babies the many women must have had. In interviews, historians and Okinawan elders said that some Okinawan women who were raped did give birth to biracial children, but that many of them were immediately killed or left behind out of shame, disgust or fearful trauma. More often, however, rape victims underwent crude abortions with the help of village midwives.<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nHowever, American professor of Japanese Studies Michael S. Molasky argues that Okinawan civilians \"were often surprised at the comparatively humane treatment they received from the American enemy.\"<ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=RMDt86cokDUC&pg=PA16 | title = The American Occupation of Japan and Okinawa: Literature and Memory | first = Michael S. | last = Molasky | page = 16 | isbn = 978-0-415-19194-4 | year = 1999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6xMuWmEsAcMC&pg=PA21 | title = Southern Exposure: Modern Japanese Literature from Okinawa | first = Michael S. | last = Molasky | first2 = Steve | last2 = Rabson | page = 22 | isbn = 978-0-8248-2300-9 | year = 2000}}</ref> According to ''Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power'' by the American [[Mark Selden]], the Americans \"did not pursue a policy of [[torture]], rape, and murder of civilians as Japanese military officials had warned.\"<ref>{{Cite book| title = Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power | first = Susan D | last = Sheehan | first2 = Laura | last2 = Elizabeth | first3 = Hein Mark | last3 = Selden | page = 18}}</ref>\n\n=====Post-war=====\n{{Main|Rape during the occupation of Japan}}\nThere were 1,336 reported rapes during the first 10 days of the occupation of [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] after the Japanese surrender.<ref name=\"Schrijvers_212\"/>\n\n==Comparative death rates of POWs==\nAccording to James D.

Many men, some the very young and old, were killed resisting or trying to escape. Once collected, they would be roped or chained together and marched, with little food or water, long distances to camp. They often died or were killed along the way, sometimes less than 50 percent reaching camp alive. Then recruit camp was no better, with hospitals resembling Nazi concentration camps... Probably 3,081,000 died during the Sino-Japanese War; likely another 1,131,000 during the Civil War\u20144,212,000 dead in total.

That same year, efforts were taken by Allied high commanders to suppress \"take no prisoners\" attitudes,<ref name=Ferguson2004/> among their own personnel (as these were affecting intelligence gathering) and to encourage Japanese soldiers to surrender. Ferguson adds that measures by Allied commanders to improve the ratio of Japanese prisoners to Japanese dead, resulted in it reaching 1:7, by mid-1945. Nevertheless, taking no prisoners was still standard practice among US troops at the [[Battle of Okinawa]], in April\u2013June 1945.<ref name=Ferguson2004/>\n\n[[Ulrich A.

Masaie Ishihara, a sociology professor, supports this: \"There is a lot of historical amnesia out there, many people don't want to acknowledge what really happened\".<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nAn explanation given for why the US military has no record of any rapes is that few - if any - Okinawan women reported abuse, mostly out of fear and embarrassment. Those who did report them are believed by historians to have been ignored by the US military police. A large scale effort to determine the extent of such crimes has also never been called for. Over five decades after the war has ended the women who were believed to have been raped still refused to give a public statement, with friends, local historians and university professors who had spoken with the women instead saying they preferred not to discuss it publicly. According to a [[Nago, Okinawa]]n police spokesman: \"Victimized women feel too ashamed to make it public\".<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nIn his book \"Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb\", George Feifer noted that by 1946 there had been fewer than 10 reported cases of rape in Okinawa. He explains that it was: \"partly because of shame and disgrace, partly because Americans were victors and occupiers\". Feifer claimed: \"In all there were probably thousands of incidents, but the victims' silence kept rape another dirty secret of the campaign.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Feifer |first=George |date=1992 |title=Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb |location=Michigan |publisher=Ticknor & Fields |isbn=9780395599242 |url=https://archive.org/details/tennozanbattleof00feif }}</ref> Many people wondered why it never came to light after the inevitable American-Japanese babies the many women must have had. In interviews, historians and Okinawan elders said that some Okinawan women who were raped did give birth to biracial children, but that many of them were immediately killed or left behind out of shame, disgust or fearful trauma. More often, however, rape victims underwent crude abortions with the help of village midwives.<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nHowever, American professor of Japanese Studies Michael S. Molasky argues that Okinawan civilians \"were often surprised at the comparatively humane treatment they received from the American enemy.\"<ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=RMDt86cokDUC&pg=PA16 | title = The American Occupation of Japan and Okinawa: Literature and Memory | first = Michael S. | last = Molasky | page = 16 | isbn = 978-0-415-19194-4 | year = 1999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6xMuWmEsAcMC&pg=PA21 | title = Southern Exposure: Modern Japanese Literature from Okinawa | first = Michael S. | last = Molasky | first2 = Steve | last2 = Rabson | page = 22 | isbn = 978-0-8248-2300-9 | year = 2000}}</ref> According to ''Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power'' by the American [[Mark Selden]], the Americans \"did not pursue a policy of [[torture]], rape, and murder of civilians as Japanese military officials had warned.\"<ref>{{Cite book| title = Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power | first = Susan D | last = Sheehan | first2 = Laura | last2 = Elizabeth | first3 = Hein Mark | last3 = Selden | page = 18}}</ref>\n\n=====Post-war=====\n{{Main|Rape during the occupation of Japan}}\nThere were 1,336 reported rapes during the first 10 days of the occupation of [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] after the Japanese surrender.<ref name=\"Schrijvers_212\"/>\n\n==Comparative death rates of POWs==\nAccording to James D.

The film was directed by [[Michael Apted]], with the original story and screenplay written by [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neal Purvis, Robert Wade]], and [[Bruce Feirstein]].<ref>Simpson, p 26</ref> It was produced by [[Michael G. Wilson]] and [[Barbara Broccoli]]. The title is taken from the Bond family coat of arms created for 007 in the 1963 novel ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''.\n\nThe film's plot revolves around the assassination of billionaire Sir Robert King by the terrorist Renard, and Bond's subsequent assignment to protect King's daughter Elektra, who had previously been held for ransom by Renard. During his assignment, Bond unravels a scheme to increase petroleum prices by triggering a [[nuclear meltdown]] in the waters of [[Istanbul]].\n\nFilming locations included Spain, France, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and the UK, with interiors shot at [[Pinewood Studios]]. Despite receiving mixed reviews, with the plot and [[Denise Richards]]' casting being frequently targeted for criticism, ''The World Is Not Enough'' earned $361,832,400 million worldwide. It was also the first [[Eon Productions|Eon]]-produced ''Bond'' film to be officially released under the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] label instead of [[United Artists]], the original owner and distributor of the film franchise.\n\n==Plot==\n\nMI6 agent James Bond arrives at a [[Swiss bank]] in [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]], to retrieve money for British oil tycoon Sir Robert King. Bond also wants the name of the killer of a fellow MI6 agent, but the banker is killed by his assistant before he can reveal it. Bond escapes from the banker's office with the money, but it is revealed to be booby-trapped; Sir Robert is killed by an explosion inside MI6 headquarters in [[London]]. Bond gives chase to the assassin on a [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]-modified speedboat down the [[River Thames|Thames]] to the [[Millennium Dome]], where she attempts to escape by [[hot air balloon]]. Bond offers her protection, but she refuses and blows up the balloon, killing herself.\n\nAlthough injured falling from the balloon, Bond is cleared for duty, attends Sir Robert's funeral, and traces the recovered money to Viktor \"Renard\" Zokas, a [[KGB]] agent-turned-[[terrorist]]. Following an earlier attempt on his life by MI6 agent 009, Renard was left with a bullet in his brain, which is gradually destroying his senses, making him immune to pain until he dies. M assigns Bond to protect King's daughter Elektra against Renard, who had previously abducted her. Bond flies to [[Azerbaijan]], where Elektra is overseeing the construction of a new segment of her family's oil pipeline. During a tour of the pipeline's proposed route through the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, [[paragliding|paraglider]]-equipped [[snowmobile]]s. Despite being unarmed, Bond is able to dispatch the snowmobiles by using the terrain to his advantage and a protective shield in his jacket. \n\nBond visits [[List of James Bond allies in GoldenEye#Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky|Valentin Zukovsky]] at his Baku [[casino]] to acquire information about Elektra's attackers; he deduces that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is secretly in league with Renard. Bond kills Davidov and takes his place on a plane bound for a Russian [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] base in [[Kazakhstan]]. He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist and meets American [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] Doctor Christmas Jones, before entering the silo. Inside, Renard is removing the [[GPS]] locator card and weapons-grade [[plutonium]] from a nuclear bomb. Before Bond can kill him, Jones blows his cover. Renard drops a hint that he and Elektra are collaborating and flees with the plutonium, while Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the locator card.\n\nBack in Azerbaijan, Bond discloses to M that [[Stockholm syndrome|Elektra may not be as innocent]] as she seems, before they discover the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to an [[Pipeline inspection gauge|inspection rig]] heading towards the oil terminal. Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig before a large section of pipeline is destroyed, and they are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals that she and Renard are conspirators, and that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for advising her father not to pay the ransom money, and imprisons her in the [[Maiden's Tower]].\n\nBond and Jones accost Zukovsky at his [[caviar]] factory in the [[Caspian Sea]] for information on Elektra, Bond having deduced Elektra's culpability himself; they are then attacked by Elektra's [[Aerial saw|sawing helicopters]]. Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was in exchange for the use of a [[submarine]], currently being captained by Zukovsky's nephew, Nikolai, who is poisoned, along with his crew, by Renard. The group goes to Istanbul, where Jones realizes that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the [[Nuclear submarine|submarine's nuclear reactor]], the resulting [[nuclear explosion]] would destroy [[Istanbul]], sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the [[Bosphorus]] and leaving Elektra's pipeline as an uncontested [[monopoly]]. Bond then receives a signal from the locator card M has activated using a clock battery, just before Zukovsky's underling, Bullion blows up the command centre. Bond and Jones are captured and separated by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine, while Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a [[garrote]]. Zukovsky and his men arrive and seize the tower, but Elektra shoots Zukovsky. Before dying, he manages to break Bond's restraints with his [[cane gun]]. Bond then frees M and kills Elektra, before diving after the submarine.\n\nBond boards the submarine and frees Jones. Following a firefight with the crew, the submarine hits the bottom of the Bosphorus, causing its hull to rupture, and the vessel starts [[flooding]]. Bond catches up with Renard and the two get into a brutal fight. Bond kills Renard by impaling him with the plutonium rod. Bond and Jones escape from the submarine via the torpedo launcher, leaving the flooded reactor to detonate safely underwater.\n\nAs MI6 tries to locate Bond by satellite surveillance, he and Jones celebrate in Turkey.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond, 007]], the movie's protagonist\n* [[Sophie Marceau]] as Elektra King, an oil heiress who is seemingly being targeted by Renard, the world's most wanted terrorist.

The film was directed by [[Michael Apted]], with the original story and screenplay written by [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade|Neal Purvis, Robert Wade]], and [[Bruce Feirstein]].<ref>Simpson, p 26</ref> It was produced by [[Michael G. Wilson]] and [[Barbara Broccoli]]. The title is taken from the Bond family Coat of Arms created for 007 in the 1963 novel ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''.\n\nThe film's plot revolves around the assassination of billionaire Sir Robert King by the terrorist Renard, and Bond's subsequent assignment to protect King's daughter Elektra, who had previously been held for ransom by Renard. During his assignment, Bond unravels a scheme to increase petroleum prices by triggering a [[nuclear meltdown]] in the waters of [[Istanbul]].\n\nFilming locations included Spain, France, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and the UK, with interiors shot at [[Pinewood Studios]]. Despite receiving mixed reviews, with the plot and [[Denise Richards]]' casting being frequently targeted for criticism, ''The World Is Not Enough'' earned $361,832,400 million worldwide. It was also the first [[Eon Productions|Eon]]-produced ''Bond'' film to be officially released under the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] label instead of [[United Artists]], the original owner and distributor of the film franchise.\n\n==Plot==\n\nMI6 agent James Bond arrives at a [[Swiss bank]] in [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]], to retrieve money for British oil tycoon Sir Robert King. Bond also wants the name of the killer of a fellow MI6 agent, but the banker is killed by his assistant before he can reveal it. Bond escapes from the banker's office with the money, but it is revealed to be booby-trapped; Sir Robert is killed by an explosion inside MI6 headquarters in [[London]]. Bond gives chase to the assassin on a [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]-modified speedboat down the [[River Thames|Thames]] to the [[Millennium Dome]], where she attempts to escape by [[hot air balloon]]. Bond offers her protection, but she refuses and blows up the balloon, killing herself.\n\nAlthough injured falling from the balloon, Bond is cleared for duty, attends Sir Robert's funeral, and traces the recovered money to Viktor \"Renard\" Zokas, a [[KGB]] agent-turned-[[terrorist]]. Following an earlier attempt on his life by MI6 agent 009, Renard was left with a bullet in his brain, which is gradually destroying his senses, making him immune to pain until he dies. M assigns Bond to protect King's daughter Elektra against Renard, who had previously abducted her. Bond flies to [[Azerbaijan]], where Elektra is overseeing the construction of a new segment of her family's oil pipeline. During a tour of the pipeline's proposed route through the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, [[paragliding|paraglider]]-equipped [[snowmobile]]s. Despite being unarmed, Bond is able to dispatch the snowmobiles by using the terrain to his advantage and a protective shield in his jacket. \n\nBond visits [[List of James Bond allies in GoldenEye#Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky|Valentin Zukovsky]] at his Baku [[casino]] to acquire information about Elektra's attackers; he deduces that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is secretly in league with Renard. Bond kills Davidov and takes his place on a plane bound for a Russian [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] base in [[Kazakhstan]]. He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist and meets American [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] Doctor Christmas Jones, before entering the silo. Inside, Renard is removing the [[GPS]] locator card and weapons-grade [[plutonium]] from a nuclear bomb. Before Bond can kill him, Jones blows his cover. Renard drops a hint that he and Elektra are collaborating and flees with the plutonium, while Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the locator card.\n\nBack in Azerbaijan, Bond discloses to M that [[Stockholm syndrome|Elektra may not be as innocent]] as she seems, before they discover the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to an [[Pipeline inspection gauge|inspection rig]] heading towards the oil terminal. Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig before a large section of pipeline is destroyed, and they are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals that she and Renard are conspirators, and that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for advising her father not to pay the ransom money, and imprisons her in the [[Maiden's Tower]].\n\nBond and Jones accost Zukovsky at his [[caviar]] factory in the [[Caspian Sea]] for information on Elektra, Bond having deduced Elektra's culpability himself; they are then attacked by Elektra's [[Aerial saw|sawing helicopters]]. Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was in exchange for the use of a [[submarine]], currently being captained by Zukovsky's nephew, Nikolai, who is poisoned, along with his crew, by Renard. The group goes to Istanbul, where Jones realizes that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the [[Nuclear submarine|submarine's nuclear reactor]], the resulting [[nuclear explosion]] would destroy [[Istanbul]], sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the [[Bosphorus]] and leaving Elektra's pipeline as an uncontested [[monopoly]]. Bond then receives a signal from the locator card M has activated using a clock battery, just before Zukovsky's underling, Bullion blows up the command centre. Bond and Jones are captured and separated by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine, while Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a [[garrote]]. Zukovsky and his men arrive and seize the tower, but Elektra shoots Zukovsky. Before dying, he manages to break Bond's restraints with his [[cane gun]]. Bond then frees M and kills Elektra, before diving after the submarine.\n\nBond boards the submarine and frees Jones. Following a firefight with the crew, the submarine hits the bottom of the Bosphorus, causing its hull to rupture, and the vessel starts [[flooding]]. Bond catches up with Renard and the two get into a brutal fight. Bond kills Renard by impaling him with the plutonium rod. Bond and Jones escape from the submarine via the torpedo launcher, leaving the flooded reactor to detonate safely underwater.\n\nAs MI6 tries to locate Bond by satellite surveillance, he and Jones celebrate in Turkey.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond, 007]], the movie's protagonist\n* [[Sophie Marceau]] as Elektra King, an oil heiress who is seemingly being targeted by Renard, the world's most wanted terrorist.

After the opening scene, the film moves to London, showcasing the [[SIS Building]] and the [[Millennium Dome]] on the [[Thames]]. The sequence lasts for about 14 minutes, the longest pre-title sequence in the Bond series to date. Originally, the pre-credits sequence was to have ended with Bond's leap from the window and descent to the ground, finishing as Bond rushes away from the area as police cars approach. Then, after the credits the sequence in MI6 headquarters would have been next, with the boat scenes the next major action sequence. However, the pre-credits scenes were viewed as lacklustre when compared to ones from previous 007 films, so the credits were pushed back to appear after the boat sequence.

The series was a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and used the same theme music composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], in a different arrangement by [[Dave Grusin]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n''The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.'' stars [[Stefanie Powers]] as American U.N.C.L.E. agent April Dancer and [[Noel Harrison]] (son of [[Rex Harrison]]) as her British partner, Mark Slate. [[Leo G. Carroll]] plays their superior, [[Alexander Waverly]]. The character name \"April Dancer\" was suggested by [[James Bond]] creator [[Ian Fleming]] who was a consultant in the creation of the parent program shortly before his death.\n\nThe series was not as successful as its parent program and was cancelled after 29 episodes due to low ratings. Several crossover episodes were produced in conjunction with ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', including the episode that introduced April and Mark. In their first appearance they were portrayed by [[Mary Ann Mobley]] and [[Norman Fell]], respectively. In the ''Girl'' crossover episode \"The Mother Muffin Affair\", Napoleon Solo ([[Robert Vaughn]]) teamed up with April Dancer.\n\nSimilar to the later spy series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', April Dancer often went on undercover missions where she had to affect a foreign accent (Powers is fluent in several languages).  Her dance training was also put to good use in several episodes, particularly \"The Mata Hari Affair\" where Powers recreated the dance performed by [[Greta Garbo]] in the film ''[[Mata Hari (1931 film)|Mata Hari]]'' (1931) and The Drublegratz Affair, where April Dancer went undercover as a go-go dancer and wore a very short miniskirt.\n\nAnother feature was the sometimes outlandish avant-garde outfits worn by Powers intended to make her appear hip and modern. She was featured on the cover of ''[[TV Guide]]'' (December 31, 1966 \u2013 January 6, 1967), and the article on her mentions the show \"...allocating roughly $1,000 an episode for stretch vinyl jackets and skirts, a bare-midriff harem-dancer outfit, miniskirts and the latest mod fashions from [[Swinging London]]'s [[Carnaby Street]].\"\n\nThe article also underscores the show's major flaw: \"Unlike her fellow U.N.C.L.E. agents, the ladylike April is not required to kill the bad guys. Her feminine charms serve as the bait, while her partner Noel Harrison provides the fireworks. She does carry, however, a perfume atomizer that sprays gas, earrings and charm bracelets that explode, among other interesting gadgets.\"\n\nIn contrast to her keen martial arts contemporaries, the lead character in ''[[Honey West (TV series)|Honey West]]'' and [[Emma Peel]] in ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', the more demure conception of April Dancer weakened the character and often turned her into a helpless damsel-in-distress. April was often knocked unconscious by T.H.R.U.S.H agents and also frequently kidnapped and left in some very perilous positions. Arming her with gimmicks and gadgets was not enough.\n\nAdditionally, the stories generally leaned toward parody, campy humor and cartoonish villains instead of the more realistic action-suspense format of its progenitor. This is largely due to the influence of the ''[[Batman (TV show)|Batman]]'' series which became an instant sensation in early 1966. During the 1966\u20131967 season, ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' also suffered a decline in ratings due to a change in format designed to appeal to ''Batman'' fans.\n\nDespite attempts at cross-promotion with its parent series \u2014 Harrison appeared as Slate in an episode of ''Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' while [[Robert Vaughn]] appeared as Napoleon Solo in an episode of ''Girl'' \u2014 the show failed to build an audience and lasted only one season. According to ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Book'' by Jon Heitland, and commentary on the DVD release of the parent series, the failure of ''Girl from U.N.C.L.E.'' was considered a contributing factor in ''Man'''s mid-season cancellation in early 1968.\n\n==Cast==\n* Stefanie Powers...April Dancer\n* Noel Harrison...Mark Slate\n* Leo G.

The opening and closing title themes and suites from the episodes \"The Dog-Gone Affair,\" \"The Prisoner of Zalamar Affair,\" \"The Mother Muffin Affair,\" \"The Mata Hari Affair,\" \"The Montori Device Affair\" and \"The Horns-of-the-Dilemma Affair\" are included on the third FSM album of music from ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.''\n\n==Original novels==\n[[Image:GirlfromUncle1.jpg|right|thumb|120px|First ''Girl from U.N.C.L.E.'' novel. Pictured: [[Stefanie Powers]] as April Dancer. Note misspelling of Powers' first name.]]\n''The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.'' was featured in five original novels, only two of which were published in the United States:\n\n*''The Birds of a Feather Affair'' by [[Michael Avallone]]\n*''The Blazing Affair'' by Michael Avallone\n*''The Global Globules Affair'' \u2013 [[Reginald Alec Martin|Simon Latter]] (published in United Kingdom, and in France as ''L'affaire des Globules'')\n*''The Golden Boats of Taradata Affair'' \u2013 Simon Latter (published in United Kingdom only)\n*''The Cornish Pixie Affair'' \u2013 Peter Leslie (published in United Kingdom only)\n\nUnlike the series, the novels were quite serious, with the plot of ''The Birds of a Feather Affair'' ending in tragedy for April when the 'innocent' character usually featured in the TV show dies despite what April does to stop the villains. In addition, the prohibition on April using deadly force on the TV series (described earlier) did not apply to the novels. The Birds of a Feather Affair was also much more  'racy' than the T.V. show. \nEarly in the book, April Dancer meets a female T.H.R.U.S.H agent called Arnolda van Atta. April holds her at gunpoint but van Atta stumbles into the Girl from Uncle and shoves a small needle into April\u2019s arm, injecting a knock-out serum into April Dancer.\nThe serum works quickly and April Dancer faints. Having successfully rendered the Girl from Uncle unconscious, van Atta removes April\u2019s clothes, leaving the unconscious April Dancer in only her bra and panties.\nref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvobscurities.com/2009/10/bookshelf-the-girl-from-u-n-c-l-e-1-the-birds-of-a-feather-affair/|title=Television Obscurities \u2013 Bookshelf: The Girl from U.N.C.L.E. #1, \"The Birds of a Feather Affair\"|date=2009-10-21|accessdate=2012-12-03}}</ref> Birds of a Feather book pages 26 to 31\n\nA ''Girl from U.N.C.L.E.'' digest magazine was also briefly published, which included [[novella]]s not published elsewhere.

The series was a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' and used the same theme music composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], in a different arrangement by [[Dave Grusin]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n''The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.'' stars [[Stefanie Powers]] as American U.N.C.L.E. agent April Dancer and [[Noel Harrison]] (son of [[Rex Harrison]]) as her British partner, Mark Slate. [[Leo G. Carroll]] plays their superior, [[Alexander Waverly]]. The character name \"April Dancer\" was suggested by [[James Bond]] creator [[Ian Fleming]] who was a consultant in the creation of the parent program shortly before his death.\n\nThe series was not as successful as its parent program and was cancelled after 29 episodes due to low ratings. Several crossover episodes were produced in conjunction with ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', including the episode that introduced April and Mark. In their first appearance they were portrayed by [[Mary Ann Mobley]] and [[Norman Fell]], respectively. In the ''Girl'' crossover episode \"The Mother Muffin Affair\", Napoleon Solo ([[Robert Vaughn]]) teamed up with April Dancer.\n\nSimilar to the later spy series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', April Dancer often went on undercover missions where she had to affect a foreign accent (Powers is fluent in several languages).  Her dance training was also put to good use in several episodes, particularly \"The Mata Hari Affair\" where Powers recreated the dance performed by [[Greta Garbo]] in the film ''[[Mata Hari (1931 film)|Mata Hari]]'' (1931) and The Drublegratz Affair, where April Dancer went undercover as a go-go dancer and wore a very short miniskirt.\n\nAnother feature was the sometimes outlandish avant-garde outfits worn by Powers intended to make her appear hip and modern. She was featured on the cover of ''[[TV Guide]]'' (December 31, 1966 \u2013 January 6, 1967), and the article on her mentions the show \"...allocating roughly $1,000 an episode for stretch vinyl jackets and skirts, a bare-midriff harem-dancer outfit, miniskirts and the latest mod fashions from [[Swinging London]]'s [[Carnaby Street]].\"\n\nThe article also underscores the show's major flaw: \"Unlike her fellow U.N.C.L.E. agents, the ladylike April is not required to kill the bad guys. Her feminine charms serve as the bait, while her partner Noel Harrison provides the fireworks. She does carry, however, a perfume atomizer that sprays gas, earrings and charm bracelets that explode, among other interesting gadgets.\"\n\nIn contrast to her keen martial arts contemporaries, the lead character in ''[[Honey West (TV series)|Honey West]]'' and [[Emma Peel]] in ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', the more demure conception of April Dancer weakened the character and often turned her into a helpless damsel-in-distress. April was often knocked unconscious by T.H.R.U.S.H agents and also frequently kidnapped and left in some very perilous positions. Arming her with gimmicks and gadgets was not enough.\n\nAdditionally, the stories generally leaned toward parody, campy humor and cartoonish villains instead of the more realistic action-suspense format of its progenitor. This is largely due to the influence of the ''[[Batman (TV show)|Batman]]'' series which became an instant sensation in early 1966. During the 1966\u20131967 season, ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' also suffered a decline in ratings due to a change in format designed to appeal to ''Batman'' fans.\n\nDespite attempts at cross-promotion with its parent series \u2014 Harrison appeared as Slate in an episode of ''Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' while [[Robert Vaughn]] appeared as Napoleon Solo in an episode of ''Girl'' \u2014 the show failed to build an audience and lasted only one season. According to ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Book'' by Jon Heitland, and commentary on the DVD release of the parent series, the failure of ''Girl from U.N.C.L.E.'' was considered a contributing factor in ''Man'''s mid-season cancellation in early 1968.\n\n==Cast==\n* Stefanie Powers...April Dancer\n* Noel Harrison...Mark Slate\n* Leo G.
