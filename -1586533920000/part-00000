{"title_page": "Write-in candidate", "text_new": "{{redirect|Write-in ballot|mail-in ballot|Postal voting}}\n{{voting}}\n\nA '''write-in candidate''' is a candidate in an election whose name does not appear on the [[ballot]], but for whom voters may [[vote]] nonetheless by writing in the person's name. The system is almost totally confined to elections in the United States.{{Citation needed}} Some [[U.S. state]]s and local jurisdictions allow a voter to affix a sticker, with the write-in candidate's name, to the ballot in lieu of actually writing in the candidate's name. Write-in candidacies are sometimes a result of a candidate being legally or procedurally ineligible to run under their own name or party; write-in candidacies may be permitted where term limits bar an incumbent candidate from being officially nominated for, or being listed on the ballot for, re-election. In some cases, write-in campaigns have been organized to support a candidate who is not personally involved in running; this may be a form of [[draft (politics)|draft]] campaign.\n\nWrite-in candidates rarely win, and sometimes write-in votes are cast for ineligible people or fictional characters. Some jurisdictions require write-in candidates be registered as official candidates before the election.<ref>See, for example, Section 1-4-1101, Colorado Revised Statutes (2008)</ref> This is standard in elections with a large pool of potential candidates, as there may be multiple candidates with the same name that could be written in. In some cases, however, the number of write-in votes cast in an election is greater than the entire margin of victory, suggesting that the write-ins may have been sufficient to tip the balance and change the outcome of the election by creating a [[spoiler effect]].<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/30/alabama-election-roy-moore-write-in-votes</ref>\n\nMany U.S. states and municipalities allow for write-in votes in a partisan [[primary election]] where no candidate is listed on the ballot to have the same functional effect as nominating petitions: for example, if there are no [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] members on the ballot for state general assembly and a candidate receives more than 200 write-in votes when the primary election is held (or the other number of signatures that were required for ballot access), the candidate will be placed on the ballot on that ballot line for the general election. In most places, this provision is in place for [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] elections as well.\n\nA write-in option may occasionally be available in a [[Referendum#Multiple-choice referendums|multiple-choice referendum]]; for example in the [[January 1982 Guamanian status referendum]].\n\n==Contrast from a blank ballot election system==\nThe term \"write-in candidate\" is used in elections in which names of candidates or parties are '''preprinted''' on a paper ballot or displayed on an electronic voting machine. The term is not generally used in elections in which all ballots are blank and thus all voters must write in the names of their preferred candidates. Blank ballot election systems reduce the cost of printing the ballots, but increase the complexity of casting and counting votes. Such systems are [[elections in Japan|used in Japan]],<ref name=\"Cox2016\">{{cite journal|last=Cox|first=Karen E.|first2=Leonard J. |last2=Schoppa|year=2016|title=Interaction Effects in Mixed-Member Electoral Systems|journal=Comparative Political Studies |quote=Japanese voters receive a blank ballot paper and are instructed to write down the name of an SMD candidate after examining a sheet posted on the wall of their voting booth.

Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]], who campaigned actively against Johnson's [[Vietnam war]] policies, was on the ballot.

Curry, Jr.]] was elected to the House as a write-in from Sacramento, California. His father, [[Congress of the United States|Congressman]] [[Charles F. Curry]] Sr., would have been listed on the ballot unopposed but, due to his untimely death, his name was removed and no candidate's name was listed on the ballot.\n*In 1958, Democrat [[Dale Alford]] was elected as a write-in candidate to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in Arkansas. As member of the [[Little Rock School District|Little Rock school board]], Alford launched his write-in campaign a week before the election because the incumbent, [[Brooks Hays]], was involved in the incident in which [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|president Eisenhower]] sent federal troops to enforce [[racial integration]] at [[Central High School (Little Rock)|Little Rock Central High School]]. Racial integration was unpopular at the time, and Alford won by approximately 1,200 votes, a 2% margin.<ref name=Rudin>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5698889|title=What Happens If Lieberman Wins|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|author=Ken Rudin|date=August 23, 2006|accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref>\n*In 1964 Democrat [[Gale Schisler]] was nominated for Congress in Illinois as a write-in candidate when no Democrat filed to run in the primary election. He defeated incumbent [[Robert McLoskey]] in the November General Election.\n*In November 1980, Republican [[Joe Skeen]] was elected to Congress in New Mexico as a write-in candidate, because of a [[spoiler candidate]] who also happened to be a write-in. No Republican had filed to run against the incumbent Democrat, [[Harold L. Runnels]], before the close of filing. Runnels died on August 5, 1980, and the Democrats requested a special primary to pick a replacement candidate. The New Mexico Secretary of State allowed the Democrats to have a special primary, but did not allow the Republicans to have a special primary, because they had already gone with no candidate. So Skeen ran as a write-in candidate. After Runnels' widow lost the Democratic special primary, she launched her own write-in candidacy, which [[vote splitting|split the Democratic vote]], taking enough votes from the Democratic nominee to [[spoiler effect|give the election]] to the Republican, Skeen, who won with a 38% [[plurality (voting)|plurality]].<ref name=Rudin/>\n*[[Ron Packard]] of California finished in second place in the 18-candidate Republican primary to replace the retiring [[Clair Burgener]]. Packard lost the primary by 92 votes in 1982, and then mounted a write-in campaign as an independent. He won the election with a 37% [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] against both a Republican and a Democratic candidate. Following the elections, he re-aligned himself as a Republican.<ref name=Rudin/>\n*Democrat [[Charlie Wilson (Ohio politician)|Charlie Wilson]] was the endorsed candidate of the Democratic Party for [[Ohio's 6th congressional district]] in Ohio to replace [[Ted Strickland]] in 2006. Strickland was running for Governor, and had to give up his congressional seat. Wilson, though, did not qualify for the ballot because only 46 of the 96 signatures on his candidacy petition were deemed valid, while 50 valid signatures were required for ballot placement. The Democratic Party continued to support Wilson, and an expensive primary campaign ensued \u2013 over $1 million was spent by both parties. Wilson overwhelmingly won the Democratic primary as a write-in candidate on May 2, 2006 against two Democratic candidates whose names were on the ballot, with Wilson collecting 44,367 votes, 67% of the Democratic votes cast.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.columbusdispatch.com/news-story.php?story=183395|title=Wilson wins primary as write-in candidate|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch|first=Alan|last=Johnson|date=May 3, 2006|accessdate=2006-06-30}}</ref> Wilson faced [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] Chuck Blasdel in the general election on November 7, 2006, and won, receiving 61% of the votes.\n*Democrat [[Dave Loebsack]] entered the 2006 Democratic primary in Iowa's second congressional district as a write-in candidate after failing to get the required number of signatures. He won the primary and in the general election he defeated 15-term incumbent [[Jim Leach]] by a 51% to 49% margin.\n*[[Jerry McNerney]] ran as a write-in candidate in the March 2004 Democratic Primary in [[California's 11th congressional district]]. He received 1,667 votes (3% of the votes cast), and, having no opposition (no candidates were listed on the Democratic primary ballot), won the primary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2004_primary/congress.pdf|format=PDF|title=Election Results for the March 2004 Primary|publisher=[[Secretary of State of California|California Secretary of State]]}}</ref> Although he lost the November 2004 general election to Republican [[Richard Pombo]], McNerney ran again in 2006 (as a candidate listed on the ballot) and won the Democratic Primary in June, and then the rematch against Pombo in November.\n*[[Shelley Sekula-Gibbs]] failed as a write-in candidate in the November 7, 2006 election to represent the 22nd Texas congressional district in the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] (for the full term commencing January 3, 2007). The seat had been vacant since June 9, 2006, due to the resignation of the then representative [[Tom DeLay]]. Therefore, on the same ballot, there were two races: one for the 110th Congress, as well as a race for the unexpired portion of the term during the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] (until January 3, 2007). Sekula-Gibbs won the race for the unexpired portion of the term during the 109th Congress as a candidate listed on the ballot. She could not be listed on the ballot for the full term because Texas law did not allow a replacement candidate to be listed on the ballot after the winner of the primary (Tom DeLay) has resigned.\n*[[Peter Welch]], a Democrat representing [[Vermont]]'s sole congressional district, became both the Democratic and Republican nominee for the House when he ran for re-election in 2008 and 2016. Because the Republicans did not field any candidate on the primary ballot in those elections, Welch won enough write-in votes to win the Republican nomination.<ref name=\"VT Times Agnus\">{{cite news |title=Sanders-loving Vermont lawmaker snags GOP nomination|date=October 7, 2016|first=Heather|last=Caygle|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/peter-welch-vermont-democrat-republican-229251|publisher=[[Politico]]}}</ref>\n\n====State legislatures====\n*Several members of the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] were elected as write-in candidates during the 1960s and 1970s, particularly from [[The Bush (Alaska)|rural districts]] in the [[Far North Alaska|northern and western portions of the state]]. Factors in play at the time include the newness of Alaska as a state and the previous absence of electoral politics in many of the rural communities, creating an environment which made it hard to attract candidates to file for office during the official filing period. Most of the areas in question were largely populated by [[Alaska natives]], who held little political power in Alaska at the time. This only began to change following the formation of the [[Alaska Federation of Natives]] and the passage of the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]]. Known examples of successful write-in candidates include Kenneth A. Garrison and [[Society of Jesus|Father]] [[Segundo Llorente]] (1960), Frank R. Ferguson (1972), James H. \"Jimmy\" Huntington (1974), and Nels A. Anderson, Jr. (1976). The incumbent in Llorente's election, Axel C. Johnson, ran for re-election as a write-in candidate after failing to formally file his candidacy paperwork. Johnson and Llorente, as write-in candidates, both outpolled the one candidate who did appear on the ballot. Ferguson and Anderson were both incumbents who launched their write-in campaigns after being defeated in the [[primary election]]. Anderson's main opponent, Joseph McGill, had himself won election to the House in 1970 against a write-in candidate by only 5 votes.\n*[[Carl Hawkinson]] of [[Galesburg, Illinois]] won the Republican primary for the [[Illinois Senate]] from Illinois's 47th District in 1986 as a write-in candidate. He went on to be elected in the general election and served until 2003. Hawkinson defeated another write-in, David Leitch, in the primary. Incumbent State Senator Prescott Bloom died in a home fire after the filing date for the primary had passed.\n* Arizona state senator [[Don Shooter]] won the 2010 primary as a write-in and went on to win the general election.\n*After failing to receive the Republican Party's 1990 [[Wilson Pakula]] nomination, incumbent and registered [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative]] New York State Senator [[Serphin Maltese]] won the party's nomination as a write-in candidate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.queensnewyork.com/elections/senateny/maltese.html|title=Serphin R.

The assassin was the only name on the ballot, so Charlotte ran as a write-in candidate.\n*[[Winnie Brinks]] was elected to the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] in 2012 after a series of unusual events. In May of that year, State Representative Roy Schmidt \u2013 who had previously filed to run for re-election as a Democrat \u2013 withdrew from the Democratic primary and re-filed as a Republican. A friend of Schmidt's nephew filed to run as a Democrat, but withdrew two days later amid anger among local Democrats. This left Democrats without a candidate. Brinks ran as a write-in to be the Democratic nominee. She won the primary and was listed on the ballot in the general election, which she also won.

In the system set up by Proposition 14, there are two rounds of voting, and the top two vote-getters for each race in the first round (the primary, held in June 2004-2018 and March 2020-present) advance to a second round (the general election, held in November). Proposition 14 specifically prohibits write-in candidates in the second round, and this prohibition was upheld in a court challenge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/california_case_law/2011/09/court-upholds-prop-14-bans-on-write-in-votes-unqualified-parties.html|title=Court Upholds Prop 14 Bans on Write-In Votes, Unqualified Parties|first=Robyn|last=Hagan Cain|date=Sep 21, 2011}}</ref> Another court challenge to the prohibition on write-in candidates in the second round was filed in July 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2014/07/30/6594480/lawsuit-challenges-write-in-rules.html|title=Lawsuit challenges write-in rules under California's top-two system|date=Jul 30, 2014|first=Christopher|last=Cadelago|publisher=[[Sacramento Bee]]}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Proposition 14 prohibits write-in candidates in the second round of voting, it has made it easier for write-in candidates in the first round to advance to the second round. This generally happens in elections where only one candidate is listed on the ballot. Since in each race the top two vote-getters from the first round are guaranteed to advance to the second round, if only one candidate is listed on the ballot, a write-in candidate can easily advance to the second round, as the write-in candidate would only have to compete with other write-in candidates for the 2nd spot, not with any listed candidates. In some [[jungle primary]] systems, if the winner in the first round wins by more than 50% of the vote, then the second (runoff) round gets cancelled, but in the system set up by Proposition 14, a second (runoff) round is required regardless of the percent of the vote that the winner of the first round received. Proposition 14 therefore guarantees that if one candidate is listed on the ballot in the first round, a write-in candidate running against the one listed candidate can earn a spot for the second round with as little as one vote.<ref group=\"n\">In the June 2012 election, a write-in candidate running in the [[California's 33rd State Senate district|33rd Senate District]] won a spot in the runoff race with as few as 3 votes.

The system is almost totally confined to elections in the United States. Some [[U.S. state]]s and local jurisdictions allow a voter to affix a sticker, with the write-in candidate's name, to the ballot in lieu of actually writing in the candidate's name. Write-in candidacies are sometimes a result of a candidate being legally or procedurally ineligible to run under their own name or party; write-in candidacies may be permitted where term limits bar an incumbent candidate from being officially nominated for, or being listed on the ballot for, re-election. In some cases, write-in campaigns have been organized to support a candidate who is not personally involved in running; this may be a form of [[draft (politics)|draft]] campaign.\n\nWrite-in candidates rarely win, and sometimes write-in votes are cast for ineligible people or fictional characters. Some jurisdictions require write-in candidates be registered as official candidates before the election.<ref>See, for example, Section 1-4-1101, Colorado Revised Statutes (2008)</ref> This is standard in elections with a large pool of potential candidates, as there may be multiple candidates with the same name that could be written in. In some cases, however, the number of write-in votes cast in an election is greater than the entire margin of victory, suggesting that the write-ins may have been sufficient to tip the balance and change the outcome of the election by creating a [[spoiler effect]].<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/30/alabama-election-roy-moore-write-in-votes</ref>\n\nMany U.S. states and municipalities allow for write-in votes in a partisan [[primary election]] where no candidate is listed on the ballot to have the same functional effect as nominating petitions: for example, if there are no [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] members on the ballot for state general assembly and a candidate receives more than 200 write-in votes when the primary election is held (or the other number of signatures that were required for ballot access), the candidate will be placed on the ballot on that ballot line for the general election. In most places, this provision is in place for [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] elections as well.\n\nA write-in option may occasionally be available in a [[Referendum#Multiple-choice referendums|multiple-choice referendum]]; for example in the [[January 1982 Guamanian status referendum]].\n\n==Contrast from a blank ballot election system==\nThe term \"write-in candidate\" is used in elections in which names of candidates or parties are '''preprinted''' on a paper ballot or displayed on an electronic voting machine. The term is not generally used in elections in which all ballots are blank and thus all voters must write in the names of their preferred candidates.

Tague]] was elected to the U.S. House as a write-in independent Democrat, defeating the Democratic nominee, [[John F. Fitzgerald]].\n*In 1930 Republican [[Charles F. Curry, Jr.]] was elected to the House as a write-in from Sacramento, California. His father, [[Congress of the United States|Congressman]] [[Charles F. Curry]] Sr., would have been listed on the ballot unopposed but, due to his untimely death, his name was removed and no candidate's name was listed on the ballot.\n*In 1958, Democrat [[Dale Alford]] was elected as a write-in candidate to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in Arkansas. As member of the [[Little Rock School District|Little Rock school board]], Alford launched his write-in campaign a week before the election because the incumbent, [[Brooks Hays]], was involved in the incident in which [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|president Eisenhower]] sent federal troops to enforce [[racial integration]] at [[Central High School (Little Rock)|Little Rock Central High School]]. Racial integration was unpopular at the time, and Alford won by approximately 1,200 votes, a 2% margin.<ref name=Rudin>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5698889|title=What Happens If Lieberman Wins|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|author=Ken Rudin|date=August 23, 2006|accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref>\n*In 1964 Democrat [[Gale Schisler]] was nominated for Congress in Illinois as a write-in candidate when no Democrat filed to run in the primary election. He defeated incumbent [[Robert McLoskey]] in the November General Election.\n*In November 1980, Republican [[Joe Skeen]] was elected to Congress in New Mexico as a write-in candidate, because of a [[spoiler candidate]] who also happened to be a write-in. No Republican had filed to run against the incumbent Democrat, [[Harold L. Runnels]], before the close of filing. Runnels died on August 5, 1980, and the Democrats requested a special primary to pick a replacement candidate. The New Mexico Secretary of State allowed the Democrats to have a special primary, but did not allow the Republicans to have a special primary, because they had already gone with no candidate. So Skeen ran as a write-in candidate. After Runnels' widow lost the Democratic special primary, she launched her own write-in candidacy, which [[vote splitting|split the Democratic vote]], taking enough votes from the Democratic nominee to [[spoiler effect|give the election]] to the Republican, Skeen, who won with a 38% [[plurality (voting)|plurality]].<ref name=Rudin/>\n*[[Ron Packard]] of California finished in second place in the 18-candidate Republican primary to replace the retiring [[Clair Burgener]]. Packard lost the primary by 92 votes in 1982, and then mounted a write-in campaign as an independent. He won the election with a 37% [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] against both a Republican and a Democratic candidate. Following the elections, he re-aligned himself as a Republican.<ref name=Rudin/>\n*Democrat [[Charlie Wilson (Ohio politician)|Charlie Wilson]] was the endorsed candidate of the Democratic Party for [[Ohio's 6th congressional district]] in Ohio to replace [[Ted Strickland]] in 2006. Strickland was running for Governor, and had to give up his congressional seat. Wilson, though, did not qualify for the ballot because only 46 of the 96 signatures on his candidacy petition were deemed valid, while 50 valid signatures were required for ballot placement. The Democratic Party continued to support Wilson, and an expensive primary campaign ensued \u2013 over $1 million was spent by both parties. Wilson overwhelmingly won the Democratic primary as a write-in candidate on May 2, 2006 against two Democratic candidates whose names were on the ballot, with Wilson collecting 44,367 votes, 67% of the Democratic votes cast.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.columbusdispatch.com/news-story.php?story=183395|title=Wilson wins primary as write-in candidate|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch|first=Alan|last=Johnson|date=May 3, 2006|accessdate=2006-06-30}}</ref> Wilson faced [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] Chuck Blasdel in the general election on November 7, 2006, and won, receiving 61% of the votes.\n*Democrat [[Dave Loebsack]] entered the 2006 Democratic primary in Iowa's second congressional district as a write-in candidate after failing to get the required number of signatures. He won the primary and in the general election he defeated 15-term incumbent [[Jim Leach]] by a 51% to 49% margin.\n*[[Jerry McNerney]] ran as a write-in candidate in the March 2004 Democratic Primary in [[California's 11th congressional district]]. He received 1,667 votes (3% of the votes cast), and, having no opposition (no candidates were listed on the Democratic primary ballot), won the primary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2004_primary/congress.pdf|format=PDF|title=Election Results for the March 2004 Primary|publisher=[[Secretary of State of California|California Secretary of State]]}}</ref> Although he lost the November 2004 general election to Republican [[Richard Pombo]], McNerney ran again in 2006 (as a candidate listed on the ballot) and won the Democratic Primary in June, and then the rematch against Pombo in November.\n*[[Shelley Sekula-Gibbs]] failed as a write-in candidate in the November 7, 2006 election to represent the 22nd Texas congressional district in the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] (for the full term commencing January 3, 2007). The seat had been vacant since June 9, 2006, due to the resignation of the then representative [[Tom DeLay]]. Therefore, on the same ballot, there were two races: one for the 110th Congress, as well as a race for the unexpired portion of the term during the [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]] (until January 3, 2007). Sekula-Gibbs won the race for the unexpired portion of the term during the 109th Congress as a candidate listed on the ballot. She could not be listed on the ballot for the full term because Texas law did not allow a replacement candidate to be listed on the ballot after the winner of the primary (Tom DeLay) has resigned.\n*[[Peter Welch]], a Democrat representing [[Vermont]]'s sole congressional district, became both the Democratic and Republican nominee for the House when he ran for re-election in 2008 and 2016. Because the Republicans did not field any candidate on the primary ballot in those elections, Welch won enough write-in votes to win the Republican nomination.<ref name=\"VT Times Agnus\">{{cite news |title=Sanders-loving Vermont lawmaker snags GOP nomination|date=October 7, 2016|first=Heather|last=Caygle|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/peter-welch-vermont-democrat-republican-229251|publisher=[[Politico]]}}</ref>\n\n====State legislatures====\n*Several members of the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] were elected as write-in candidates during the 1960s and 1970s, particularly from [[The Bush (Alaska)|rural districts]] in the [[Far North Alaska|northern and western portions of the state]]. Factors in play at the time include the newness of Alaska as a state and the previous absence of electoral politics in many of the rural communities, creating an environment which made it hard to attract candidates to file for office during the official filing period. Most of the areas in question were largely populated by [[Alaska natives]], who held little political power in Alaska at the time. This only began to change following the formation of the [[Alaska Federation of Natives]] and the passage of the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]]. Known examples of successful write-in candidates include Kenneth A. Garrison and [[Society of Jesus|Father]] [[Segundo Llorente]] (1960), Frank R. Ferguson (1972), James H. \"Jimmy\" Huntington (1974), and Nels A. Anderson, Jr. (1976). The incumbent in Llorente's election, Axel C. Johnson, ran for re-election as a write-in candidate after failing to formally file his candidacy paperwork. Johnson and Llorente, as write-in candidates, both outpolled the one candidate who did appear on the ballot. Ferguson and Anderson were both incumbents who launched their write-in campaigns after being defeated in the [[primary election]]. Anderson's main opponent, Joseph McGill, had himself won election to the House in 1970 against a write-in candidate by only 5 votes.\n*[[Carl Hawkinson]] of [[Galesburg, Illinois]] won the Republican primary for the [[Illinois Senate]] from Illinois's 47th District in 1986 as a write-in candidate. He went on to be elected in the general election and served until 2003. Hawkinson defeated another write-in, David Leitch, in the primary. Incumbent State Senator Prescott Bloom died in a home fire after the filing date for the primary had passed.\n* Arizona state senator [[Don Shooter]] won the 2010 primary as a write-in and went on to win the general election.\n*After failing to receive the Republican Party's 1990 [[Wilson Pakula]] nomination, incumbent and registered [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative]] New York State Senator [[Serphin Maltese]] won the party's nomination as a write-in candidate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.queensnewyork.com/elections/senateny/maltese.html|title=Serphin R.

The assassin was the only name on the ballot, so Charlotte ran as a write-in candidate.\n*[[Winnie Brinks]] was elected to the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] in 2012 after a series of unusual events. In May of that year, State Representative Roy Schmidt \u2013 who had previously filed to run for re-election as a Democrat \u2013 withdrew from the Democratic primary and re-filed as a Republican. A friend of Schmidt's nephew filed to run as a Democrat, but withdrew two days later amid anger among local Democrats. This left Democrats without a candidate. Brinks ran as a write-in to be the Democratic nominee. She won the primary and was listed on the ballot in the general election, which she also won. Coincidentally, the general election also saw a write-in candidate, Bing Goei, receive significant support.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2012/12/winnie_brinks.html|title=Winnie Brinks takes oath of office as Michigan's 76th District State Representative|work=MLive.com|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Scott Wagner]] was elected as an anti-establishment Republican write-in candidate to the [[Pennsylvania Senate]] in a March 2014 special election over endorsed Republican nominee [[Ron Miller (Pennsylvania politician)|Ron Miller]] and Democrat Linda Small.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jan|last=Murphy|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2014/03/york_county_senate_seat_winner.html |title=Scott Wagner makes history with his win in York County Senate race |publisher=PennLive.com |date=March 18, 2014 |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Nick Freitas]] was re-elected as a write-in candidate after missing a filing deadline to appear on the ballot in the Virginia House of Delegates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/local/freitas-write-in-campaign-focused-on-winning-supporting-other-gop/article_0fd0e98b-33e4-5b4d-b25f-d03de9e72ffa.html|title=Freitas write-in campaign focused on winning, supporting other GOP candidates|last=STAR-EXPONENT|first=ALLISON BROPHY CHAMPION CULPEPER|website=Fredericksburg.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191011001006/https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/local/freitas-write-in-campaign-focused-on-winning-supporting-other-gop/article_0fd0e98b-33e4-5b4d-b25f-d03de9e72ffa.html|archive-date=2019-10-11|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.starexponent.com/news/abundant-spelling-variations-as-culpeper-certifies-write-in-votes-for/article_973fa6db-37d0-567a-9f04-ea6aa56dee9f.html|title=Abundant spelling variations as Culpeper certifies 5,205 write-in votes for Nick Freitas|first1= Allison|last1 =Brophy Chapmpion|publisher= [[Culpeper Star-Exponent]]|date= Nov 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Local government====\n*Angela Allen was elected Mayor of [[Tar Heel, North Carolina]] (population 115) as a write-in candidate in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fayobserver.com/news/local/small-town-has-charm-of-its-own/article_ba841b88-d8ed-5934-96d6-de98ea77c022.html|title=Small town has charm of its own|first=Greg Barnes and MarCharia|last=Henderson|publisher=}}</ref>\n*Julia Allen of [[Readington Township, New Jersey|Readington, New Jersey]] won a write-in campaign in the November 2005 elections for the Township Committee,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.co.hunterdon.nj.us/election/2005general/readington.htm#committee|title=2005 General Election results for Hunterdon County}}</ref> after a candidate accused of corruption had won the primary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.braac.org/HCN-readington_campaign_violations.pdf|title=Reprint from The Huntington County News|publisher=}}</ref>\n*[[Tom Ammiano]], President of the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]], entered the race for Mayor of San Francisco as a write-in candidate two weeks before the 1999 general election.

In the system set up by Proposition 14, there are two rounds of voting, and the top two vote-getters for each race in the first round (the primary, held in June 2004-2018 and March 2020-present) advance to a second round (the general election, held in November). Proposition 14 specifically prohibits write-in candidates in the second round, and this prohibition was upheld in a court challenge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/california_case_law/2011/09/court-upholds-prop-14-bans-on-write-in-votes-unqualified-parties.html|title=Court Upholds Prop 14 Bans on Write-In Votes, Unqualified Parties|first=Robyn|last=Hagan Cain|date=Sep 21, 2011}}</ref> Another court challenge to the prohibition on write-in candidates in the second round was filed in July 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2014/07/30/6594480/lawsuit-challenges-write-in-rules.html|title=Lawsuit challenges write-in rules under California's top-two system|date=Jul 30, 2014|first=Christopher|last=Cadelago|publisher=[[Sacramento Bee]]}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Proposition 14 prohibits write-in candidates in the second round of voting, it has made it easier for write-in candidates in the first round to advance to the second round. This generally happens in elections where only one candidate is listed on the ballot. Since in each race the top two vote-getters from the first round are guaranteed to advance to the second round, if only one candidate is listed on the ballot, a write-in candidate can easily advance to the second round, as the write-in candidate would only have to compete with other write-in candidates for the 2nd spot, not with any listed candidates. In some [[jungle primary]] systems, if the winner in the first round wins by more than 50% of the vote, then the second (runoff) round gets cancelled, but in the system set up by Proposition 14, a second (runoff) round is required regardless of the percent of the vote that the winner of the first round received. Proposition 14 therefore guarantees that if one candidate is listed on the ballot in the first round, a write-in candidate running against the one listed candidate can earn a spot for the second round with as little as one vote.<ref group=\"n\">In the June 2012 election, a write-in candidate running in the [[California's 33rd State Senate district|33rd Senate District]] won a spot in the runoff race with as few as 3 votes.
