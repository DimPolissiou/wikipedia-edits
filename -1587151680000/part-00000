The university's iconic buildings act as symbols of wider Aberdeen, particularly Marischal College in the city centre and the [[crown steeple]] of King's College in [[Old Aberdeen]]. There are two campuses; the predominantly utilised King's College campus dominates the section of the city known as [[Old Aberdeen]], which is approximately two miles north of the city centre. Although the original site of the university's foundation, most academic buildings apart from the King's College Chapel and Quadrangle were constructed in the 20th century during a period of significant expansion. The university's [[Foresterhill]] campus is next to [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary]] and houses the [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine and Dentistry|School of Medicine and Dentistry]] as well as the School of Medical Sciences. Together these buildings comprise one of Europe's largest health campuses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-aberdeen/courses/medicine|title=Medicine - University of Aberdeen|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en}}</ref> The annual income of the institution for 2017\u201318 was \u00a3219.5&nbsp;million of which \u00a356.1&nbsp;million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of \u00a3226.8&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"accounts\"/>\n\nAberdeen has {{HESA student population|INSTID=0170}} students from undergraduate to doctoral level (as of {{HESA year}}), including many international students. An abundant range of disciplines are taught at the university, with 650 undergraduate degree programmes offered in the 2012\u201313 academic year.

It is said to have been founded in 1157 by Edward, Bishop of Aberdeen, and although, according to Boece, it still existed at the period when King's College was founded, it is probable that it had in some way ceased to answer the purposes which it must have been designed to serve, since King James IV., in his letter to Pope Alexander VI., requesting him to found a University in Old Aberdeen, mentions as the chief motive for the undertaking, the profound ignorance of the inhabitants of the north of Scotland, and the great deficiency of properly educated men to fill the clerical office in that part of his kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gregory|first=William|title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland (1845)|publisher=|year=1845|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe first university in Aberdeen, [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], formally '''The University and King's College of Aberdeen (Collegium Regium Abredonense)''', was founded on 10th February 1494 by [[William Elphinstone]], [[Bishop of Aberdeen]], [[Chancellor]] of Scotland, and a graduate of the [[University of Glasgow]] drafting a request on behalf of [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV]] to [[Pope Alexander VI]] resulting in a [[Papal Bull]] being issued.<ref name=\"foundation\" /> It seems that James was keen to ensure that Scotland had as many universities as England at the time, and it was to possess all the privileges enjoyed by those of Paris and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], two of the most highly favoured in Europe. The university, modelled on that of the [[University of Paris]] and intended principally as a [[law school]], soon became the most famous and popular of the Scots seats of learning, largely due to the prestige of Elphinstone and his friend, [[Hector Boece]], the first principal appointed in 1500. Its aim was to train doctors, teachers and clergy who would serve the communities of northern Scotland, as well as lawyers and administrators for the Scottish Crown. It was a collegiate foundation with 36 full-time staff and students and walls protecting it from the outside world. In 1497 the College established the first [[Regius Professor|chair of medicine]] in the English-speaking world. \n\nFollowing the [[Scottish Reformation]] in 1560, King's College was purged of its Roman Catholic staff but in other respects was largely resistant to change. [[George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal|George Keith]], the fifth [[Earl Marischal]] was a moderniser within the college and supportive of the reforming ideas of [[Peter Ramus]] and [[Andrew Melville]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/noblecollege/building.htm |title=This Noble College: Building on the European tradition |publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=20 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508105123/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/noblecollege/building.htm |archivedate=8 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In April 1593 he founded a second university in the city, [[Marischal College]]. It is also possible the founding of another college in nearby [[Fraserburgh]] by Sir Alexander Fraser, a business rival of Keith, was instrumental in its creation. Aberdeen was highly unusual at this time for having two universities in one city: as 20th-century University prospectuses observed, Aberdeen had the same number as existed in England at the time (the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]]).\n[[File:Kings College, Aberdeen about 1661. Wellcome M0008087.jpg|alt=|thumb|An illustration of King's College in 1661.]]\nInitially, Marischal College offered the Principal of King's College a role in selecting its academics, but this was refused - the first blow in a developing rivalry. Marischal College, in the commercial heart of the city (rather than the ancient but much smaller collegiate enclave of Old Aberdeen), was quite different in nature and outlook. For example, it was more integrated into the life of the city, such as allowing students to live outwith the College. The two rival colleges often clashed, sometimes in court, but also in brawls between students on the streets of Aberdeen. [[Duncan Liddel|Duncan Liddell]] endowed the first chair in mathematics at Marischal in 1613, but the first professor wasn't appointed until 1626.\n\nAs the institutions put aside their differences, a process of attempted (but unsuccessful) mergers began in the 17th century. During this time, both colleges made notable intellectual contributions to the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. Both colleges supported the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebellion and following the defeat of the [[1715 rising]] were largely purged by the authorities of their academics and officials.\n\n===King Charles' University (1641-61) and the merger of the two Colleges (1860)===\n[[File:Marischal College, Aberdeen - geograph.org.uk - 1548676.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Marischal College]]\nThe nearest the two colleges had come to full union was as the \"Caroline University of Aberdeen\", a merger initiated by [[Charles I of England|Charles I of Scotland]] in 1641, which united the two colleges for twenty years. Following the civil conflicts of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], a more complete unification was attempted following the ratification of Parliament by [[Oliver Cromwell]] during the [[English Interregnum|interregnum]] in 1654. This united university survived until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] whereby all laws made during this period were rescinded by [[Charles II of Scotland|Charles II]] and the two colleges reverted to independent status.<ref name=\"electricscotland.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/statistical/kings.htm |title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland - Account of the University and King's College of Aberdeen |publisher=Electricscotland.com |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> Charles I is still recognised as one of the university's founders, due to his part in creating the Caroline University and his benevolence towards King's College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/archive/2004/pr1311.hti |publisher=Public Relations, University of Aberdeen, pubrel@abdn.ac.uk |title=Founders' Day Service |date=9 November 2004 |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> Further unsuccessful suggestions for union were brought about throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref name=\"electricscotland.com\" /> The evolving examination system now required much higher academic standards from the students. The two colleges in Aberdeen merged on 15 September 1860 in accordance with the [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1858]], which also created a new medical school at Marischal College. The 1858 [[Act of Parliament]] stated the \"''united University shall take rank among the Universities of Scotland as from the date of erection of King's College and University.''\" The university is thus Scotland's third oldest and the United Kingdom's fifth oldest University.\n\n===The modern university===\nThe relationship of the two ex-college campuses has changed over the years. While at the time of unification each had approximately equal numbers of students, buildings at Marischal College began to be expanded in the late-19th century with a significant rebuilding effort completed in 1906. In the 20th century, the university expanded greatly, particularly at King's College. New buildings were constructed on the land around King's College throughout the 20th century. Initially, these were built to match the ancient buildings (e.g. the New King's lecture rooms and Elphinstone Hall), but later ones from the 1960s onward were constructed in [[Brutalism|brutalist]] style. Meanwhile, the Foresterhill campus began to train medical students in the 1930s next to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\n[[File:Sir Duncan Rice Library 2018-04-21.jpg|alt=|thumb|192x192px|Fa\u00e7ade of the Sir Duncan Rice Library in Old Aberdeen]]\nDuring the mid-20th century departments which had been at Marischal College moved into one of these new buildings (most at King's College) and by the late 20th-century Marischal College had been abandoned by all but the Anatomy Department, a graduation hall and the Marischal Museum ([[Marischal College]] has now been restored as the headquarters of Aberdeen City Council, which is leasing a portion of the complex from the university). Following extensive fundraising, a \u00a357 million new university library (the [[Sir Duncan Rice Library]]) opened in autumn 2011 at the King's College campus to replace the outgrown Queen Mother Library<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/library/about/main/|title=The Sir Duncan Rice Library |publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref> and was officially opened by the Queen in September 2012.<ref name=\"Queen New Library\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19707174|title=Queen opens new library at Aberdeen University|publisher=BBC News|date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> Today, most students spend most of their time in modern buildings which provide up-to-date facilities for teaching, research and other activities such as dining. However, the old buildings at King's College are still in use as lecture and tutorial rooms and accommodation for various academic departments.\n\nIn February 2020, the [[Scottish Funding Council]] (SFC) found that in approving a financial settlement agreement with the former Principal [[Ian Diamond|Professor Sir Ian Diamond]], the university failed to make best use of public funds or exercise good governance. As a result of the investigation, the university was ordered to repay \u00a3119,000 of grant finance to the SFC and undertake an externally-facilitated examination of its governance and culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/aberdeen-told-repay-ps119k-over-ex-heads-gardening-leave|title=Aberdeen told to repay \u00a3119K over ex-head\u2019s \u2018gardening leave\u2019|last=Grove|first=Jack|date=18 February 2020|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\nThe original buildings of both colleges which united to form the university are much admired architectural features of Aberdeen. The main campus is now at King's College, where the original buildings are still in use in addition to many newer buildings of largely [[modernist]] style. A second campus at [[Foresterhill]] houses the [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|School of Medicine, Medical Science & Nutrition]].<ref name=\"estates\"/> In addition, there are smaller facilities at other sites such as the [[Royal Cornhill Hospital]] to the west of the city centre, and the [[Rowett Research Institute|Rowett Institute]] in [[Bucksburn]].\n\n===King's College===\n{{See also|King's College, Aberdeen}}\n[[File:AberdeenKingsCollegeChapel 2013-08.jpg|alt=|thumb|King's College quad|left]]\nThe King's College campus covers an area of some 35 hectares around the ancient [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] buildings and the High Street. It hosts around two-thirds of the university's built estate and most student facilities, and lies 2 miles north of [[Aberdeen]] city centre.<ref name=\"estates\"/> The university does not own all the buildings on the \"campus\" which also include private houses, shops and businesses (although many of these rely heavily on custom from the university community) and it is best thought of as a district of the city dominated by the university. It can be reached from the city centre by bus routes 1, 2, 13, 19 and 20 operated by [[First Aberdeen]] and from northern Aberdeenshire or the bus station at Union Square by various routes operated by [[Stagecoach Bluebird]].\n[[File:New King's, Old Aberdeen. - geograph.org.uk - 115911.jpg|alt=|thumb|New Building, King's College (\"New Kings\")]]\nThe historic King's College buildings form a [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with interior court, two sides of which have been rebuilt and expanded with a library wing in the 19th century. The Crown Tower and the Chapel, the oldest parts, date from around 1500. The original foundation contained the Chapel, the Great Hall and living accommodation, with its own kitchen and brewery, a well in the quadrangle, and a college garden to provide herbs and vegetables. The Grammar School was just outside the walls, in front of the College. The Crown Tower is surmounted by a structure about 40&nbsp;ft (12 m) high, consisting of a six-sided lantern and Imperial crown, both sculptured, and resting on the intersections of two arched ornamental slips rising from the four corners of the top of the tower. This crown, also known as the \"Crown of Kings\", frequently acts as a symbol of the university. The [[choir]] of the chapel contains original oak-canopied stalls, miserere seats, and lofty open screens in the French flamboyant style. They were preserved by the college's Principal during the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], who fought off local barons who had attacked the nearby [[St Machar's Cathedral]].  The Cromwell Tower, created between 1658-1662 opposite the Crown Tower, was originally built as residential accommodation, but an observatory was built on top in 1826.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/nph120/astro/cto/histcrom.htm|title=History of the Cromwell Tower Observatory|last=|first=|date=|website=Aberdeen University History|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The library wing was converted into an exhibition and conference venue in the 1990s and today also houses the university's Business School.\nThe first of the modern age of construction in the King's campus began with the construction in 1913 of the New Building (now known as ''\"New King's\"''), largely in a similar architectural style to the old buildings. New King's groups to form a yet larger quadrangle-like green for the campus also bordered by the High Street, King's and [[Elphinstone Hall]], a traditional 1930 replacement for the Great Hall. The Elphinstone Hall was subsequently used as a dining facility but is now used for graduations, examinations, fairs, and other large university events.\n\nHowever, most students and staff spend relatively little time in these historic buildings, with a large number of modern ones housing most facilities and academic departments. Most date from the second half of the 20th century. Some of these echo the existing architecture of [[Old Aberdeen]], such as the Fraser Noble Building with its distinctive concrete crown designed to resemble the one adorning King's College. Other buildings were constructed of stone in the 1950s (e.g. the Taylor Building and Meston Building). A number of other buildings are designed in the [[Brutalism|brutalist style]], such as the Arts Lecture Theatre and adjoining William Guild Building, opened in 1969 to house the School of Psychology. Also on the site is the [[Cruickshank Botanic Garden]] which was presented to the university in 1899 and is open to the public.\n\n[[File:Aberdeen University Library interior atrium, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK.JPG|thumb|Atrium of the main Sir Duncan Rice Library at King's College campus, looking up]]The most recent building on campus is the Sir Duncan Rice Library, completed in 2011 and designed by Danish architects [[Schmidt Hammer Lassen]]. It was officially opened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in September 2012 and named after [[Duncan Rice]], a previous Principal of the university.<ref name=\"Queen New Library\" /> This seven-storey tower, clad in zebra-like jagged stripes of white and clear glass, replaced the smaller Queen Mother Library as the university's main library and can be seen prominently from the entire campus and much of the city. It is open to the public and outstanding views of the city and coastline are available from the upper floors. In addition to expanded facilities it also houses public exhibition space and the university's historic collections, comprising more than a quarter of a million ancient and priceless books and manuscripts collected over five centuries since the university's foundations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/release.php?id=530|publisher=University of Aberdeen|accessdate=13 August 2009|title=Press Release: 'Flagship library project to match academic ambitions' leads next phase of University\u2019s infrastructure investment}}</ref> Other libraries are in the Taylor Building on the same campus (for law books and materials) and at Foresterhill (for medicine and medical sciences). The university's library service (i.e. including all libraries) holds over one million books.\n\n===Marischal College===\n{{See also|Marischal College}}\n[[File:Marischal College - panoramio (1).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Marischal College (following restoration in 2011)]]\n[[Marischal College]] is a [[neo-Gothic]] building, having been rebuilt in 1836\u201341, and greatly extended several years later. Formerly an open three-sided court, the college now forms a quadrangle as additions to the buildings were opened by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1906 and form the current facade from Broad Street. The building is widely considered to be one of the best examples of neo-Gothic [[architecture]] in Great Britain; the architect, [[Alexander Marshall Mackenzie]] was a native of Aberdeen as well as an alumnus of the university. The Mitchell Tower at the rear is named for the benefactor (Dr [[Charles Mitchell (shipbuilder)|Charles Mitchell]]) who paid for the graduation hall. The opening of this tower in 1895 was part of celebrations of the 400th anniversary of the university.\n\nUntil 1996, Marischal College housed the Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Biomedical Sciences, which had been there for many decades. From 1996, the departments moved to Kings College campus and Foresterhill campus.  Teaching no longer takes place at Marischal College, with many of the departments formerly based there having moved to King's College some decades previously. While graduations and other events (e.g. concerts) took place in the cathedral-like Mitchell Hall in the north wing, for many years much of the building (including the frontage to the street) was derelict. A restoration project was completed in 2011 and restored the building and its ornamentation. The Broad Street frontage is now on long-term lease to [[Aberdeen City Council]] and forms the administrative headquarters for the city, replacing the ageing St. Nicholas House across the street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/about/campus/marischal-college-394.php|title=Marischal College {{!}} About {{!}} The University of Aberdeen|website=www.abdn.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref> The project provided modernized public facilities and office accommodation for the Council as well as cosmetic rejuvenation, and involved the demolition and reconstruction of internal spaces while retaining and restoring the outer walls and windows. The university controls the north wing of the building containing the Marischal Museum and Mitchell Hall which was used in the past for graduation and other academic ceremonies.<ref name=\"estates\"/> Graduations take place at [[Elphinstone Hall]] at King's College.\n\n===Other campuses===\n====Doha, Qatar====\nA new state of the art campus has been established in Doha, Qatar since May 2017. They have expanded their School of Business to Qatar. The courses currently offered are Accounting & finance and Business Management. The first batch started on 10 September 2017.\nThe university requirements are the same as those in the Kings College Campus which are A<sup>*</sup>ABB to AAAB. These students will be the first ones to graduate at a campus abroad.\nThe current dean of the college is Brian Buckley. The Provost is Dr Karen Foster.\n\n[[File:Kingscollegeaberdeen2.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to King's College Quadrangle]]\n\n====Foresterhill====\nThe Foresterhill site contains the university's [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|School of Medicine, Medical Science & Nutrition]], Medical Library and associated modern buildings for teaching and research. The School includes the Rowett Institute of Nutrition, the Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Applied Health Sciences, Institute of Dentistry, and Institute of Education for Medical & Dental Sciences. It is at Foresterhill, in Aberdeen's West End. It became part of the university's holdings in 1938 following the move of the Medical School and forms part of a modern teaching hospital complex alongside the [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary]]. The 41 hectare site is split between the university (owning around a third) and [[NHS Scotland|NHS Grampian]].<ref name=\"estates\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/estates/strategy.shtml|publisher=University Estates Office|accessdate=13 August 2009|title=Estate Strategy 2002-2007}}</ref>\n\n====Hilton====\nA small campus at Hilton became part of the university estate following a merger in 2001 between the university and the Aberdeen campus of the Northern College, and temporarily became home to the university's Faculty of Education.

This gives the university a tripartite constitution comprising the [[General Council (Scottish university)|General Council]] of senior academics and graduates, the [[University Court]] responsible for finances and administration, and the [[Academic Senate]] (''Senatus Academicus'')--the university's supreme academic body.\n[[File:Elphinstone Hall Wiki.jpg|left|thumb|Elphinstone Hall]]\nThere are correspondingly three main officers of the university. It is nominally headed by the [[University Chancellor|Chancellor]], a largely ceremonial position traditionally held by the [[Bishop of Aberdeen]] but divorced from the see as a result of the [[Scottish Reformation]] and holders are now elected for life by the General Council. There is also a [[Rector of the University of Aberdeen|rector of the university]], who chairs the University Court and is elected by the students for a three-year term to represent their interests. There are also four Assessors, ten Masters, including the Principal and Vice Principal, and the factor or Procurator.\n\nThe administrative head and [[chief executive]] of the university is its [[University Principal|principal and vice chancellor]]. The principal acts as chair of the ''Senatus Academicus'', and his status as [[vice chancellor]] enables him to perform the functions reserved to the chancellor in the latter's absence, such as the awarding of degrees.\n\n====Chancellor====\n[[File:Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall - ABr 1831JC143a.jpg|thumb|150x150px|[[Camilla, Duchess of Rothesay]]]]\nThe [[Chancellor (university)|chancellor]] is the nominal head of the university.

Academic dress is usually worn only at formal occasions, such as at graduation, Founder's Day, or academic processions which take place for ceremonial reasons. For undergraduate degrees (e.g. MA, BSc, LLB etc.), a long black gown is worn with a hood of black silk and lined with silk in a colour which varies depending on discipline. For example, the lining is white silk for all [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degrees, green silk for [[Bachelor of Science]] in pure sciences, and crimson silk for [[MBChB]].

The university's iconic buildings act as symbols of wider Aberdeen, particularly Marischal College in the city centre and the [[crown steeple]] of King's College in [[Old Aberdeen]]. There are two campuses; the predominantly utilised King's College campus dominates the section of the city known as [[Old Aberdeen]], which is approximately two miles north of the city centre. Although the original site of the university's foundation, most academic buildings apart from the King's College Chapel and Quadrangle were constructed in the 20th century during a period of significant expansion. The university's [[Foresterhill]] campus is next to [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary]] and houses the [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine and Dentistry|School of Medicine and Dentistry]] as well as the School of Medical Sciences. Together these buildings comprise one of Europe's largest health campuses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-aberdeen/courses/medicine|title=Medicine - University of Aberdeen|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en}}</ref> The annual income of the institution for 2017\u201318 was \u00a3219.5&nbsp;million of which \u00a356.1&nbsp;million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of \u00a3226.8&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"accounts\"/>\n\nAberdeen has {{HESA student population|INSTID=0170}} students from undergraduate to doctoral level (as of {{HESA year}}), including many international students. An abundant range of disciplines are taught at the university, with 650 undergraduate degree programmes offered in the 2012\u201313 academic year. Many important figures in the field of divinity were educated at the university, particularly in its earlier history, giving rise to the [[Aberdeen doctors]] in the 17th century, and the prolific [[Scottish Enlightenment|enlightenment]] philosopher [[Thomas Reid]] during the [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish Enlightenment.]] [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation#University of Aberdeen|Five Nobel laureates]] have since been associated with the university.<ref name=FastFacts>{{cite web |url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/fast-facts.php |title=Fast Facts | publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{for|history pre-1860|King's College, Aberdeen|Marischal College}}\n\n===King's and Marischal Colleges===\n[[File:King's College, Aberdeen (4315559621).jpg|alt=|thumb|King's College, Aberdeen.]]\nThere appears to have existed in Old Aberdeen, from a very early period, a ''Studium Generate,'' or University, attached to the Episcopal Chapter of the See of Aberdeen. It is said to have been founded in 1157 by Edward, Bishop of Aberdeen, and although, according to Boece, it still existed at the period when King's College was founded, it is probable that it had in some way ceased to answer the purposes which it must have been designed to serve, since King James IV., in his letter to Pope Alexander VI., requesting him to found a University in Old Aberdeen, mentions as the chief motive for the undertaking, the profound ignorance of the inhabitants of the north of Scotland, and the great deficiency of properly educated men to fill the clerical office in that part of his kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gregory|first=William|title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland (1845)|publisher=|year=1845|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe first university in Aberdeen, [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], formally '''The University and King's College of Aberdeen (Collegium Regium Abredonense)''', was founded on 10th February 1494 by [[William Elphinstone]], [[Bishop of Aberdeen]], [[Chancellor]] of Scotland, and a graduate of the [[University of Glasgow]] drafting a request on behalf of [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV]] to [[Pope Alexander VI]] resulting in a [[Papal Bull]] being issued.<ref name=\"foundation\" /> It seems that James was keen to ensure that Scotland had as many universities as England at the time, and it was to possess all the privileges enjoyed by those of Paris and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], two of the most highly favoured in Europe. The university, modelled on that of the [[University of Paris]] and intended principally as a [[law school]], soon became the most famous and popular of the Scots seats of learning, largely due to the prestige of Elphinstone and his friend, [[Hector Boece]], the first principal appointed in 1500. Its aim was to train doctors, teachers and clergy who would serve the communities of northern Scotland, as well as lawyers and administrators for the Scottish Crown. It was a collegiate foundation with 36 full-time staff and students and walls protecting it from the outside world. In 1497 the College established the first [[Regius Professor|chair of medicine]] in the English-speaking world. \n\nFollowing the [[Scottish Reformation]] in 1560, King's College was purged of its Roman Catholic staff but in other respects was largely resistant to change. [[George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal|George Keith]], the fifth [[Earl Marischal]] was a moderniser within the college and supportive of the reforming ideas of [[Peter Ramus]] and [[Andrew Melville]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/noblecollege/building.htm |title=This Noble College: Building on the European tradition |publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=20 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508105123/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/noblecollege/building.htm |archivedate=8 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In April 1593 he founded a second university in the city, [[Marischal College]]. It is also possible the founding of another college in nearby [[Fraserburgh]] by Sir Alexander Fraser, a business rival of Keith, was instrumental in its creation. Aberdeen was highly unusual at this time for having two universities in one city: as 20th-century University prospectuses observed, Aberdeen had the same number as existed in England at the time (the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]]).\n[[File:Kings College, Aberdeen about 1661. Wellcome M0008087.jpg|alt=|thumb|An illustration of King's College in 1661.]]\nInitially, Marischal College offered the Principal of King's College a role in selecting its academics, but this was refused - the first blow in a developing rivalry. Marischal College, in the commercial heart of the city (rather than the ancient but much smaller collegiate enclave of Old Aberdeen), was quite different in nature and outlook. For example, it was more integrated into the life of the city, such as allowing students to live outwith the College. The two rival colleges often clashed, sometimes in court, but also in brawls between students on the streets of Aberdeen. [[Duncan Liddel|Duncan Liddell]] endowed the first chair in mathematics at Marischal in 1613, but the first professor wasn't appointed until 1626.\n\nAs the institutions put aside their differences, a process of attempted (but unsuccessful) mergers began in the 17th century. During this time, both colleges made notable intellectual contributions to the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. Both colleges supported the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebellion and following the defeat of the [[1715 rising]] were largely purged by the authorities of their academics and officials.\n\n===King Charles' University (1641-61) and the merger of the two Colleges (1860)===\n[[File:Marischal College, Aberdeen - geograph.org.uk - 1548676.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Marischal College]]\nThe nearest the two colleges had come to full union was as the \"Caroline University of Aberdeen\", a merger initiated by [[Charles I of England|Charles I of Scotland]] in 1641, which united the two colleges for twenty years. Following the civil conflicts of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], a more complete unification was attempted following the ratification of Parliament by [[Oliver Cromwell]] during the [[English Interregnum|interregnum]] in 1654. This united university survived until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] whereby all laws made during this period were rescinded by [[Charles II of Scotland|Charles II]] and the two colleges reverted to independent status.<ref name=\"electricscotland.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/statistical/kings.htm |title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland - Account of the University and King's College of Aberdeen |publisher=Electricscotland.com |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> Charles I is still recognised as one of the university's founders, due to his part in creating the Caroline University and his benevolence towards King's College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/archive/2004/pr1311.hti |publisher=Public Relations, University of Aberdeen, pubrel@abdn.ac.uk |title=Founders' Day Service |date=9 November 2004 |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> Further unsuccessful suggestions for union were brought about throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref name=\"electricscotland.com\" /> The evolving examination system now required much higher academic standards from the students. The two colleges in Aberdeen merged on 15 September 1860 in accordance with the [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1858]], which also created a new medical school at Marischal College. The 1858 [[Act of Parliament]] stated the \"''united University shall take rank among the Universities of Scotland as from the date of erection of King's College and University.''\" The university is thus Scotland's third oldest and the United Kingdom's fifth oldest University.\n\n===The modern university===\nThe relationship of the two ex-college campuses has changed over the years. While at the time of unification each had approximately equal numbers of students, buildings at Marischal College began to be expanded in the late-19th century with a significant rebuilding effort completed in 1906. In the 20th century, the university expanded greatly, particularly at King's College. New buildings were constructed on the land around King's College throughout the 20th century. Initially, these were built to match the ancient buildings (e.g. the New King's lecture rooms and Elphinstone Hall), but later ones from the 1960s onward were constructed in [[Brutalism|brutalist]] style. Meanwhile, the Foresterhill campus began to train medical students in the 1930s next to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\n[[File:Sir Duncan Rice Library 2018-04-21.jpg|alt=|thumb|192x192px|Fa\u00e7ade of the Sir Duncan Rice Library in Old Aberdeen]]\nDuring the mid-20th century departments which had been at Marischal College moved into one of these new buildings (most at King's College) and by the late 20th-century Marischal College had been abandoned by all but the Anatomy Department, a graduation hall and the Marischal Museum ([[Marischal College]] has now been restored as the headquarters of Aberdeen City Council, which is leasing a portion of the complex from the university). Following extensive fundraising, a \u00a357 million new university library (the [[Sir Duncan Rice Library]]) opened in autumn 2011 at the King's College campus to replace the outgrown Queen Mother Library<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/library/about/main/|title=The Sir Duncan Rice Library |publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref> and was officially opened by the Queen in September 2012.<ref name=\"Queen New Library\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19707174|title=Queen opens new library at Aberdeen University|publisher=BBC News|date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> Today, most students spend most of their time in modern buildings which provide up-to-date facilities for teaching, research and other activities such as dining. However, the old buildings at King's College are still in use as lecture and tutorial rooms and accommodation for various academic departments.\n\nIn February 2020, the [[Scottish Funding Council]] (SFC) found that in approving a financial settlement agreement with the former Principal [[Ian Diamond|Professor Sir Ian Diamond]], the university failed to make best use of public funds or exercise good governance. As a result of the investigation, the university was ordered to repay \u00a3119,000 of grant finance to the SFC and undertake an externally-facilitated examination of its governance and culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/aberdeen-told-repay-ps119k-over-ex-heads-gardening-leave|title=Aberdeen told to repay \u00a3119K over ex-head\u2019s \u2018gardening leave\u2019|last=Grove|first=Jack|date=18 February 2020|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\nThe original buildings of both colleges which united to form the university are much admired architectural features of Aberdeen. The main campus is now at King's College, where the original buildings are still in use in addition to many newer buildings of largely [[modernist]] style. A second campus at [[Foresterhill]] houses the [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|School of Medicine, Medical Science & Nutrition]].<ref name=\"estates\"/> In addition, there are smaller facilities at other sites such as the [[Royal Cornhill Hospital]] to the west of the city centre, and the [[Rowett Research Institute|Rowett Institute]] in [[Bucksburn]].\n\n===King's College===\n{{See also|King's College, Aberdeen}}\n[[File:AberdeenKingsCollegeChapel 2013-08.jpg|alt=|thumb|King's College quad|left]]\nThe King's College campus covers an area of some 35 hectares around the ancient [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] buildings and the High Street. It hosts around two-thirds of the university's built estate and most student facilities, and lies 2 miles north of [[Aberdeen]] city centre.<ref name=\"estates\"/> The university does not own all the buildings on the \"campus\" which also include private houses, shops and businesses (although many of these rely heavily on custom from the university community) and it is best thought of as a district of the city dominated by the university. It can be reached from the city centre by bus routes 1, 2, 13, 19 and 20 operated by [[First Aberdeen]] and from northern Aberdeenshire or the bus station at Union Square by various routes operated by [[Stagecoach Bluebird]].\n[[File:New King's, Old Aberdeen. - geograph.org.uk - 115911.jpg|alt=|thumb|New Building, King's College (\"New Kings\")]]\nThe historic King's College buildings form a [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with interior court, two sides of which have been rebuilt and expanded with a library wing in the 19th century. The Crown Tower and the Chapel, the oldest parts, date from around 1500. The original foundation contained the Chapel, the Great Hall and living accommodation, with its own kitchen and brewery, a well in the quadrangle, and a college garden to provide herbs and vegetables. The Grammar School was just outside the walls, in front of the College. The Crown Tower is surmounted by a structure about 40&nbsp;ft (12 m) high, consisting of a six-sided lantern and Imperial crown, both sculptured, and resting on the intersections of two arched ornamental slips rising from the four corners of the top of the tower. This crown, also known as the \"Crown of Kings\", frequently acts as a symbol of the university. The [[choir]] of the chapel contains original oak-canopied stalls, miserere seats, and lofty open screens in the French flamboyant style. They were preserved by the college's Principal during the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], who fought off local barons who had attacked the nearby [[St Machar's Cathedral]].  The Cromwell Tower, created between 1658-1662 opposite the Crown Tower, was originally built as residential accommodation, but an observatory was built on top in 1826.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/nph120/astro/cto/histcrom.htm|title=History of the Cromwell Tower Observatory|last=|first=|date=|website=Aberdeen University History|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The library wing was converted into an exhibition and conference venue in the 1990s and today also houses the university's Business School.\nThe first of the modern age of construction in the King's campus began with the construction in 1913 of the New Building (now known as ''\"New King's\"''), largely in a similar architectural style to the old buildings. New King's groups to form a yet larger quadrangle-like green for the campus also bordered by the High Street, King's and [[Elphinstone Hall]], a traditional 1930 replacement for the Great Hall. The Elphinstone Hall was subsequently used as a dining facility but is now used for graduations, examinations, fairs, and other large university events.\n\nHowever, most students and staff spend relatively little time in these historic buildings, with a large number of modern ones housing most facilities and academic departments. Most date from the second half of the 20th century. Some of these echo the existing architecture of [[Old Aberdeen]], such as the Fraser Noble Building with its distinctive concrete crown designed to resemble the one adorning King's College. Other buildings were constructed of stone in the 1950s (e.g. the Taylor Building and Meston Building). A number of other buildings are designed in the [[Brutalism|brutalist style]], such as the Arts Lecture Theatre and adjoining William Guild Building, opened in 1969 to house the School of Psychology. Also on the site is the [[Cruickshank Botanic Garden]] which was presented to the university in 1899 and is open to the public.\n\n[[File:Aberdeen University Library interior atrium, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK.JPG|thumb|Atrium of the main Sir Duncan Rice Library at King's College campus, looking up]]The most recent building on campus is the Sir Duncan Rice Library, completed in 2011 and designed by Danish architects [[Schmidt Hammer Lassen]]. It was officially opened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in September 2012 and named after [[Duncan Rice]], a previous Principal of the university.<ref name=\"Queen New Library\" /> This seven-storey tower, clad in zebra-like jagged stripes of white and clear glass, replaced the smaller Queen Mother Library as the university's main library and can be seen prominently from the entire campus and much of the city. It is open to the public and outstanding views of the city and coastline are available from the upper floors. In addition to expanded facilities it also houses public exhibition space and the university's historic collections, comprising more than a quarter of a million ancient and priceless books and manuscripts collected over five centuries since the university's foundations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/release.php?id=530|publisher=University of Aberdeen|accessdate=13 August 2009|title=Press Release: 'Flagship library project to match academic ambitions' leads next phase of University\u2019s infrastructure investment}}</ref> Other libraries are in the Taylor Building on the same campus (for law books and materials) and at Foresterhill (for medicine and medical sciences). The university's library service (i.e. including all libraries) holds over one million books.\n\n===Marischal College===\n{{See also|Marischal College}}\n[[File:Marischal College - panoramio (1).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Marischal College (following restoration in 2011)]]\n[[Marischal College]] is a [[neo-Gothic]] building, having been rebuilt in 1836\u201341, and greatly extended several years later. Formerly an open three-sided court, the college now forms a quadrangle as additions to the buildings were opened by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1906 and form the current facade from Broad Street. The building is widely considered to be one of the best examples of neo-Gothic [[architecture]] in Great Britain; the architect, [[Alexander Marshall Mackenzie]] was a native of Aberdeen as well as an alumnus of the university. The Mitchell Tower at the rear is named for the benefactor (Dr [[Charles Mitchell (shipbuilder)|Charles Mitchell]]) who paid for the graduation hall. The opening of this tower in 1895 was part of celebrations of the 400th anniversary of the university.\n\nUntil 1996, Marischal College housed the Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Biomedical Sciences, which had been there for many decades. From 1996, the departments moved to Kings College campus and Foresterhill campus.  Teaching no longer takes place at Marischal College, with many of the departments formerly based there having moved to King's College some decades previously. While graduations and other events (e.g. concerts) took place in the cathedral-like Mitchell Hall in the north wing, for many years much of the building (including the frontage to the street) was derelict. A restoration project was completed in 2011 and restored the building and its ornamentation. The Broad Street frontage is now on long-term lease to [[Aberdeen City Council]] and forms the administrative headquarters for the city, replacing the ageing St. Nicholas House across the street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/about/campus/marischal-college-394.php|title=Marischal College {{!}} About {{!}} The University of Aberdeen|website=www.abdn.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref> The project provided modernized public facilities and office accommodation for the Council as well as cosmetic rejuvenation, and involved the demolition and reconstruction of internal spaces while retaining and restoring the outer walls and windows. The university controls the north wing of the building containing the Marischal Museum and Mitchell Hall which was used in the past for graduation and other academic ceremonies.<ref name=\"estates\"/> Graduations take place at [[Elphinstone Hall]] at King's College.\n\n===Other campuses===\n====Doha, Qatar====\nA new state of the art campus has been established in Doha, Qatar since May 2017. They have expanded their School of Business to Qatar. The courses currently offered are Accounting & finance and Business Management. The first batch started on 10 September 2017.\nThe university requirements are the same as those in the Kings College Campus which are A<sup>*</sup>ABB to AAAB. These students will be the first ones to graduate at a campus abroad.\nThe current dean of the college is Brian Buckley. The Provost is Dr Karen Foster.\n\n[[File:Kingscollegeaberdeen2.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to King's College Quadrangle]]\n\n====Foresterhill====\nThe Foresterhill site contains the university's [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|School of Medicine, Medical Science & Nutrition]], Medical Library and associated modern buildings for teaching and research. The School includes the Rowett Institute of Nutrition, the Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Applied Health Sciences, Institute of Dentistry, and Institute of Education for Medical & Dental Sciences. It is at Foresterhill, in Aberdeen's West End.

This gives the university a tripartite constitution comprising the [[General Council (Scottish university)|General Council]] of senior academics and graduates, the [[University Court]] responsible for finances and administration, and the [[Academic Senate]] (''Senatus Academicus'')--the university's supreme academic body.\n[[File:Elphinstone Hall Wiki.jpg|left|thumb|Elphinstone Hall]]\nThere are correspondingly three main officers of the university. It is nominally headed by the [[University Chancellor|Chancellor]], a largely ceremonial position traditionally held by the [[Bishop of Aberdeen]] but divorced from the see as a result of the [[Scottish Reformation]] and holders are now elected for life by the General Council. There is also a [[Rector of the University of Aberdeen|rector of the university]], who chairs the University Court and is elected by the students for a three-year term to represent their interests. There are also four Assessors, ten Masters, including the Principal and Vice Principal, and the factor or Procurator.\n\nThe administrative head and [[chief executive]] of the university is its [[University Principal|principal and vice chancellor]]. The principal acts as chair of the ''Senatus Academicus'', and his status as [[vice chancellor]] enables him to perform the functions reserved to the chancellor in the latter's absence, such as the awarding of degrees.\n\n====Chancellor====\n[[File:Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall - ABr 1831JC143a.jpg|thumb|150x150px|[[Camilla, Duchess of Rothesay]]]]\nThe [[Chancellor (university)|chancellor]] is the nominal head of the university.

Academic dress is usually worn only at formal occasions, such as at graduation, Founder's Day, or academic processions which take place for ceremonial reasons. For undergraduate degrees (e.g. MA, BSc, LLB etc.), a long black gown is worn with a hood of black silk and lined with silk in a colour which varies depending on discipline. For example, the lining is white silk for all [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degrees, green silk for [[Bachelor of Science]] in pure sciences, and crimson silk for [[MBChB]]. A black mortarboard is also worn. For master's degrees (e.g. [[MSc]], MLitt etc.) a long black gown is worn, with a white silk hood lined in a colour that varies by discipline. For [[PhD]], the doctor's scarlet robe is worn with black facings and sleeve lining, along with a black \"John Knox\" cap. For other doctoral degrees (e.g. EdD, LLD etc.), the scarlet robe has facings and sleeve linings in a different colour.\n\n==Academic profile==\n\n===Rankings and reputation===\n\n{{Infobox UK university rankings\n| ARWU_N = 21-28\n| ARWU_W = 201-300\n| QS_N = 23=\n| QS_W = 194\n| THE_N = 28\n| THE_W = 168\n| LEIDEN_W = 107\n| LINE_1 = 0\n| Complete = 29\n| The_Guardian = 34\n| Times/Sunday_Times = 27\n}}\n{{further|Rankings of universities in the United Kingdom}}Aberdeen is consistently ranked among the top 200 universities in the world<ref name=\":0\" /> and is ranked within the top 30 universities in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> In the 2019 ''Times Higher Education University Impact Rankings'', Aberdeen was ranked 31st in the world for impact on society.<ref name=\":3\" /> Aberdeen was also named the 2019 Scottish University of the Year by The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide.<ref name=\":4\" /> Its highest internationally ranked subject is Divinity and Religious Studies, which is ranked at 34th in the world<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2019/theology-divinity-religious-studies|title=Theology, Divinity & Religious Studies|date=15 February 2019|website=Top Universities|language=en|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref> and joint 7th in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nuk-tnl-deck-prod-static.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/a57d48399922b03419153a9760c5ce53.html|title=University Guide 2016 - The Times|website=nuk-tnl-deck-prod-static.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref> It also has an excellent reputation for medical research and many of its subjects are ranked in top 10 in the UK, including Accounting & Finance (ranked 10th in the UK, [[Complete University Guide|Complete 2020]]), Civil Engineering (9th in the UK, Complete 2020), Dentistry (9th in the UK, Complete 2020), Education (8th in the UK, Complete 2020), General Engineering (7th in the UK, Complete 2020), Law (9th in the UK, Complete 2020), Linguistics (3rd in the UK, Complete 2020) and Sports Science (2nd in the UK, Complete 2020).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings|title=Top UK University League Tables and Rankings 2020|website=www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref> Aberdeen also has great reputation for economics with leading graduate prospect in the country.

Originally a modified version of the Firestreak, Red Top emerged as a much more capable weapon, with roughly double the range, a more sensitive seeker giving limited all-aspect capability, and an even larger warhead than the already-large one in Firestreak.\n\nRed Top was originally intended to replace Firestreak outright, but carrying the missiles on the [[English Electric Lightning]] required additional area to be added to the Lightning's [[vertical stabilizer]]. For this reason, Firestreak continued to be used on older models of the Lightning, and both missiles passed out of service in 1988 when the last of the Lightnings retired.\n\n==Development==\n===Improved Blue Jay===\nEven before the original [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] entered service, improvements were being studied to increase its performance. Still known by its [[rainbow code]] \"Blue Jay\", Blue Jay Mk. II introduced an improved seeker and more powerful motor, Magpie II. Mk. III derated the motor to limit acceleration when launched at high speed in order to avoid overheating due to aerodynamic friction. Neither project was proceeded with.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=35}}\n\n===Blue Vesta===\nLooking for a further improved weapon for the [[Operational Requirement F.155]] interceptors, in 1955 the Air Ministry issued OR.1131 for an all-aspect design capability against enemy aircraft traveling at Mach 2. De Havilland responded with Blue Jay Mk. IV, which was later given its own rainbow code, \"Blue Vesta\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\nBlue Vesta adopted the PbTe seeker of Mk. II, further upgrading the motor to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as \"mach tips\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}{{efn|More widely known today as a cropped delta.}}\n\nWork on Blue Vesta was curtailed after 1956 as the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) concluded that the rapid closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so quick that the missile would have no chance to be launched while it was still within the range of its seeker. They suggested moving to the much larger [[radar]]-guided [[Red Hebe]], although some low-level work on Blue Vesta's underlying technologies continued.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\n===Red Top===\nF.155 was canceled in the aftermath of the release of the [[1957 Defence White Paper]]. It was decided to proceed with the development of the [[English Electric Lightning]] largely because it was already close to being complete. Blue Vesta was reactivated in July 1957 to arm this aircraft. For security reasons, yet another rainbow code was assigned in November 1957 and it became Red Top.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nIn contrast to Blue Vesta, Red Top was a simpler design, more of a rationalised, upgraded version of the earlier Firestreak. Lower launch speeds allowed the steel wings and fins to be abandoned and they were replaced with larger surfaces that provided more maneuvering power. New attachments allowed them to be removed for storage. The fuselage was straightened, removing the boat-tail design of the Firestreak and allowing the new \"Linnet\" rocket motor to more completely fill the increased volume. Other oddities of the Firestreak, like the fin actuators being in the nose and requiring pushrods running the length of the fuselage were removed, giving it a much more logical layout and further increasing internal volume.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe all-aspect [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) seeker developed for Blue Vesta was replaced by a much less expensive [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) system known as \"Violet Banner\". This seeker lacked the sensitivity of the PbTe model and did not offer general all-aspect capability; while it worked against supersonic targets warmed by skin friction, it would not work against subsonic targets and required a tail-aspect in these cases.<ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/aveeltg.html The English Electric (BAC) Lightning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This loss in performance was offset to some degree through a greatly increased the [[field of view]] to 60&nbsp;degrees. Firestreak's tube-powered electronics were replaced by [[transistor]]ized versions, which greatly improved reliability and eliminated the need for continual cooling. {{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nThese changes allowed the warhead to be moved to the forward fuselage from its former rear-mounted location. This move also allowed it to be enlarged to 31&nbsp;kg (68.3&nbsp;lb) from Firestreak's already prodigious 22.7&nbsp;kg (50&nbsp;lb) and added an [[expanding-rod warhead]] in place of the earlier blast fragmentation type. With the warhead moved forward, room was left at the rear of the fuselage for one of the two rows of the IR [[proximity fuse]], improving its view of targets. The new \"Green Garland\" fuse required only one row of smaller rectangular \"windows\", compared to the Firestreak's two rows of larger triangular windows, further simplifying the layout.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe Red Top was faster<ref name=Boyne267>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA267&lpg=PA267 Boyne, Walter J, ''Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia, Volume 1''], pub ABC-CLIO Inc, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57607-345-9}} p267.</ref> and had greater range and maneuvrability than the Firestreak, and its [[infrared seeker]] enabled a wider range of engagement angles. \"Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, Red Top and Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK.\"<ref name=Black141>Black, Ian, ''The Last of the Lightnings'', pub PSL, 1996, {{ISBN|1-85260-541-3}}, p141.</ref>\n\n===Almost cancelled===\nAlthough Red Top was a relatively straightforward upgrade to Firestreak, [[Duncan Sandys]] almost cancelled it as well. He felt that Firestreak would be acceptable during the short period before the [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound Mk.

The [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] argued this point, ultimately convincing him that Red Top's head-on attack profile against new Soviet supersonic bombers known to be in development was an urgent requirement.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt a February 1958 meeting of the Controller of Guided Weapons and Electronics, the group earmarked Red Top for both Lightning and the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It was expected that Red Top would offer a dramatic leap in performance for Sea Vixen, as its enlarged motor significantly improved its performance when launched subsonically, the relative improvement is less when launched from Lightning. There was also some discussion of mounting four Red Top on [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], likely the B.112 version that had been proposed to replace Sea Vixen for long-duration [[combat air patrol]].{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nIndependently, in 1959 Jon Fozard of [[Hawker Aircraft]] also considered using Red Top on the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]], assuming the aircraft to have a larger engine, a pair of Red Top, and the [[AIRPASS]] radar from the Lightning.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Testing and service===\n[[File:Red Top.jpg|right|thumb|Red Top on display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford|RAF Museum Cosford]].]]\n[[File:Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile mounted on an [[English Electric Lightning]] at the [[RAF Museum]] at [[Hendon]], [[London]]. ]]\n\nRed Top testing began using the new fuselage layout with the original Firestreak faceted nosecone and leftover Magpie III motors from the Blue Vesta program. Ten such lash-ups had been fired by June 1959. Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an [[English Electric Canberra]] beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Red Top entered service on both the Lightning and Sea Vixen in [[1964 in aviation|1964]]. It remained in service until the final retirement of the Lightning in [[1988 in aviation|1988]].<ref>Gibson 2007, p. 41, 42</ref> Unusually, the missile that the Red Top was intended to replace \u2013 Firestreak \u2013 also remained in service on the Lightning until 1988. This was because Red Top's larger wing area required the Lightning to have a larger fin to maintain stability, leaving Firestreak on the other models that were already in service.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Further upgrades===\nWhile development of Red Top was being carried out, another adaptation of the original Firestreak was being considered to produce a [[semi-active radar homing]] version that would allow a single airframe to be converted from IR to radar by changing the nose section. Initially known as Blue Jay Mk. V, this became \"Blue Dolphin\", but this was cancelled in 1958.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nA longer-ranged Red Top Mk. 2 was also proposed, replacing the Linnet rocket with a [[liquid fuel rocket]] running on MADI/RFNA, likely the de Havilland Spartan.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n== Former operators ==\n[[File:Red Top operators.png|thumb|Map with Red Top operators in blue]]\n; {{KUW}}\n* [[Kuwait Air Force]]\n; {{SAU}}\n* [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]\n; {{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Navy]], [[Fleet Air Arm]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow Codes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book\n  | last1 = Gibson| first1 = Chris\n  | first2 = Tony| last2 = Buttler\n  | title = British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles\n  | publisher = Midland Publishing\n  | year= 2007\n  | pages = 47\u201353\n  | isbn = 978-1-85780-258-0 \n  |ref=harv\n}}\n\n{{UKmissiles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Top (Missile)}}\n[[Category:Cold War air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox weapon\n|is_missile=yes\n| image= Red Top missile.png\n| image_size = 250\n|caption= Red Top missile\n|name=Red Top\n|type=[[Air-to-air missile]]\n|origin=United Kingdom\n|era=Cold War\n|platform=aircraft\n|target=aircraft\n|manufacturer=Hawker Siddeley Dynamics\n|design_date=\n|production_date=\n|service=1964 - 1988\n|used_by= United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait\n|wars=\n|spec_type= homing missile\n|diameter= 0.23 m\n|wingspan=0.91 m\n|length=3.32 m\n|weight= 154 kg\n|speed=Mach 3.2\n|vehicle_range=7.5 miles (12 km)\n|ceiling=\n|filling=31 kg (68.3 lb) [[annular blast fragmentation]]\n|engine=''Linnet'' solid fuel motor\n|steering=control surfaces\n|guidance=[[infrared homing]], limited [[all-aspect]]\n|variants=?\n|number=\n|detonation=''Green Garland'' infrared proximity; secondary contact [[fuze]]\n}}\n\nThe [[Hawker Siddeley]] (later [[British Aerospace]]) '''Red Top''' was the third indigenous British [[air-to-air missile]] to enter service, following the [[de Havilland Firestreak]] and limited-service [[Fireflash]].

In his book, Tac lamented the rapid [[Population of Native California|population decline]] of his Luise\u00f1o people after the founding of the mission:\n\n<blockquote>In Quechla not long ago there were 5,000 souls, with all their neighboring lands. Through a sickness that came to California, 2,000 souls died, and 3,000 were left.<ref name=\"Lightfoot, p. 108\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Mission-born, [[Franciscan]]-educated Tac wrote that his people initially attempted to bar the Spaniards from invading their [[Southern California]] lands. When the foreigners approached:\n\n<blockquote>\"...the chief stood up...and met them,\" demanding, \"...what are you looking for? Leave our Country!\"</blockquote>\n\nPablo Tac went on to describe the preferential conditions and treatment the padres received:\n\n<blockquote>In the mission of San Luis Rey de Francia the Fernandi\u00f1o {{sic}} father is like a king. He has his pages, alcaldes, majordomos, musicians, soldiers, gardens, ranchos, livestock....<ref>Lightfoot, p. 105</ref></blockquote><ref>The earliest surviving first-person writings by a native Californian of life in a mission is by Pablo Tac (1822\u20131841), a Luise\u00f1o from Mission San Luis Rey de Francia. Christian Clifford, author of Meet Pablo Tac, wrote \"On January 15, 1834, Father Peyr\u00ed, Pablo, and Agapito left San Fernando College [Mexico City] and in February boarded a ship for Europe. They travelled via New York and France, arriving in Barcelona, Spain, on June 21. The 'New' World was coming to meet the 'Old' World.\" (p.33) Tac arrived in Rome in September 1834 and was enrolled in the College of the Propaganda, studying Latin grammar. He went on to study rhetoric, humanities, and philosophy in preparation for missionary work. It was while at the College that he created Luise\u00f1o written language and wrote the \"Conversion of the San Luise\u00f1os of Alta California.\" {{cite book\n| author    = Clifford, Christian\n| year      = 2017\n| title     = Meet Pablo Tac: Indian from the Far Shores of California\n| publisher = CreateSpace, North Charleston, SC\n| isbn      = 978-1-5425-2930-3\n}}</ref>\n\n==Mexican and early American eras==\nThe first Peruvian Pepper Tree (''[[Schinus molle]]'') in California was planted here in 1830, now iconic, widely planted, and renamed the ''California Pepper tree'' in the state.

In his book, Tac lamented the rapid [[Population of Native California|population decline]] of his Luise\u00f1o people after the founding of the mission:\n\n<blockquote>In Quechla not long ago there were 5,000 souls, with all their neighboring lands. Through a sickness that came to California, 2,000 souls died, and 3,000 were left.<ref name=\"Lightfoot, p. 108\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe Mission-born, [[Franciscan]]-educated Tac wrote that his people initially attempted to bar the Spaniards from invading their [[Southern California]] lands. When the foreigners approached:\n\n<blockquote>\"...the chief stood up...and met them,\" demanding, \"...what are you looking for? Leave our Country!\"</blockquote>\n\nPablo Tac went on to describe the preferential conditions and treatment the padres received:\n\n<blockquote>In the mission of San Luis Rey de Francia the Fernandi\u00f1o {{sic}} father is like a king. He has his pages, alcaldes, majordomos, musicians, soldiers, gardens, ranchos, livestock....<ref>Lightfoot, p. 105</ref></blockquote><ref>The earliest surviving first-person writings by a native Californian of life in a mission is by Pablo Tac (1822\u20131841), a Luise\u00f1o from Mission San Luis Rey de Francia. Christian Clifford, author of Meet Pablo Tac, wrote \"On January 15, 1834, Father Peyr\u00ed, Pablo, and Agapito left San Fernando College [Mexico City] and in February boarded a ship for Europe. They travelled via New York and France, arriving in Barcelona, Spain, on June 21. The 'New' World was coming to meet the 'Old' World.\" (p.33) Tac arrived in Rome in September 1834 and was enrolled in the College of the Propaganda, studying Latin grammar. He went on to study rhetoric, humanities, and philosophy in preparation for missionary work. It was while at the College that he created Luise\u00f1o written language and wrote the \"Conversion of the San Luise\u00f1os of Alta California.\" {{cite book\n| author    = Clifford, Christian\n| year      = 2017\n| title     = Meet Pablo Tac: Indian from the Far Shores of California\n| publisher = CreateSpace, North Charleston, SC\n| isbn      = 978-1-5425-2930-3\n}}</ref>\n\n==Mexican and early American eras==\nThe first Peruvian Pepper Tree (''[[Schinus molle]]'') in California was planted here in 1830, now iconic, widely planted, and renamed the ''California Pepper tree'' in the state.

It is a sequel to 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', the seventh mainline installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the twelfth entry in the franchise overall. The film is written and directed by [[Simon Kinberg]] (in his feature directorial debut) and stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring <!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->[[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Sophie Turner]], [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Alexandra Shipp]], and [[Jessica Chastain]]<!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->. In ''Dark Phoenix'', the X-Men are forced to face the full power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] after a mission in space goes wrong.\n\nAfter ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) erased the events of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) from the [[X-Men (film series)|series']] timeline, Kinberg expressed interest in a new adaptation of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\" in a future film that would be more faithful than his previous attempt with ''The Last Stand'', which was not well received, and even he and writer [[Zak Penn]] were equally unhappy with how it turned out. The new adaptation was confirmed as a follow-up to ''Apocalypse'' in 2016. Kinberg signed on to make his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] in June 2017, when the majority of the cast was set to return from ''Apocalypse''. Filming began later that month in [[Montreal]] and was completed in October 2017; the entire third act was later reshot in late 2018, following poor test screenings. The film was dedicated to the memory of ''X-Men'' co-creator [[Stan Lee]], who died in 2018.\n\n''Dark Phoenix'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 7, 2019, produced by [[20th Century Fox]], and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. It grossed $252{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a $200-million budget and became the lowest-grossing installment in the series. It also received generally unfavorable reviews from critics with various critical takes; many viewed it as a disappointing and anticlimactic conclusion to Fox's ''X-Men'' series although the performances of the cast and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score were praised.<ref name=\"Reviews1\" /><ref name=\"Reviews2\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, eight-year-old [[Jean Grey]] and her parents get into a car accident that kills her mother. Shortly afterward, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] takes her to [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] because her father was afraid of her.\n\nIn 1992, the [[X-Men]] respond to a distress signal from the [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], which is critically damaged by solar flare-like energy during the [[STS-49]] mission. While they save the astronauts, Jean is stranded and struck by the energy which she absorbs into her body to save her team's aircraft from destruction. She survives the event, and her psychic powers are greatly amplified as a result, but they become uncontrollable, and she accidentally unleashes her power on mutants celebrating the victory at Xavier's school. Xavier had placed mental walls in Jean's mind as a girl to protect her psychic mind from experiencing trauma; these are destroyed by Jean's enhanced power, and the trauma slowly returns, resulting in her being full of rage and pain. She travels to her childhood hometown after finding out that her father is still alive and learns that he abandoned her. Jean recovers her complete memory of the car accident and remembers that she had inadvertently caused it rendering her mother unconscious at the wheel with her telepathy, which causes her to develop [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. The X-Men arrive and attempt to take Jean home, but she uses her power against [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme]], injuring the former and killing the latter, before fleeing.\n\nJean travels to the mutant refugee island of [[Genosha]] to seek assistance from [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] in controlling her rage but is turned away by him after she engages in combat with U.S. military forces tasked with her arrest. Jean meets Vuk, the leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]]. She explains to Jean that she has bonded with [[Phoenix Force (comics)|a force of cosmic power]] that wiped out the D'Bari home planet long ago. The power had consumed all those it came across until it was drawn to Jean. Meanwhile, [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], mad with grief by Raven's death, allies with Erik and the mutant refugees in an attempt to kill Jean in [[New York City]].\n\nUpon learning of Erik's plan, the X-Men try to stop him and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|his faction of mutants]]. As they battle, Erik manages to enter the building and confront Jean, only to fall to her amplified powers. Xavier then enters the building with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]]. Jean attacks them until Xavier convinces her to read his memories &ndash; allowing her personality to resurface. Feeling remorseful, Jean offers to let Vuk take the force from her; however, it is revealed that doing so would kill Jean, as well as revealing that Vuk also intends to use the force to conquer Earth. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] are able to prevent Vuk from fully absorbing the force from Jean, though Jean loses consciousness from the ordeal. Troops sent by the U.S. government, who use stun weapons and power-inhibiting collars, attack and subdue both mutant factions, who are placed on a train headed towards a containment facility.\n\nOn the train, Xavier admits to Hank that the latter was right in his earlier accusations of violating Jean's mind. The train is attacked by Vuk and her D'Bari forces. When the soldiers are overpowered by the shape-shifters, the mutants are freed from their restraints to combat the threat. The mutants deal with most of the D'Bari attackers, but Vuk arrives and heads for Jean, defeating each mutant who attempts to stop her. Xavier confers with Jean within his mind, allowing Jean to gain control of her power. After forgiving Xavier, Jean saves the mutants from Vuk's attacks and the ensuing train wreck before proceeding to disintegrate the remaining D'Bari when they attack her. Vuk once again attempts to drain Jean of the force, but Jean takes Vuk into outer space, retakes the power that Vuk had received earlier, and then kills her. Jean then disappears in a burst of energy in the form of a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, Xavier's school is renamed the \"Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters\", and Hank becomes their new dean with Xavier having retired. While settling himself in [[Paris]], Xavier is reunited with Erik and agrees to play a game of chess with him. As they start playing, a flaming phoenix appears in the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Dark Phoenix cast.jpg|140|1150|The cast of ''Dark Phoenix'' promoting the film at the 2019 [[WonderCon]].

Kinberg and Singer both expressed interest in the prospect, and hinted that 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' would set up elements for a retelling. ''Apocalypse'' introduces [[Sophie Turner]] as a young Jean Grey, and begins exploring \"how powerful she is.\"<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" /> By April 2016, the sequel to ''Apocalypse'' was believed to indeed re-adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga.\"<ref name=\"HHApr2016\" /> In May 2016, Kinberg said that the next ''X-Men'' film after ''Apocalypse'' would be set in the 1990s, advancing one decade, as had been done for each of the previous few ''X-Men'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergMay2016\" /> He also noted that ''Apocalypse'' had introduced younger versions of several characters from the original ''X-Men'' films to give them a new [[origin story]]\u2014including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and Jean Grey\u2014with the intention of then exploring them in their own line of films.

The final costumes for the film feature the yellow-and-blue design of the original comics, but combine features of designs from many different incarnations of the group. Kinberg also looked to ''Logan'' for general design inspiration, wanting to replicate the \"naturalistic\" and \"handmade\" quality of that film for the costumes, sets, props, and title design.

It becomes a \"fight for Jean's soul\" and features a twist that was intended to have significant repercussions on the entire franchise.<ref name=\"EWCover\" /> Lawrence revealed that she had worked to convince Kinberg to direct the film, and had promised to return for it if he did so, despite her dislike of the make-up required to portray her character.<ref name=\"EWLawrence2\" /> It was also revealed then that the film would introduce a version of the island [[Genosha]], adapted to the film as a mutant refuge led by Magneto;<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> and that it would focus on the female characters more so than previous films in the series, particularly Jean Grey as both the protagonist and antagonist of the film, and Chastain's character, with whom Grey has a complex relationship.<ref name=\"XWomen\" />\n\nFox delayed the film's release in March 2018, pushing it back from November 2, 2018 to February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> This was because Fox and Kinberg wanted to schedule some routine reshoots for the film after receiving feedback from audiences during a test screening, but were not able to get all of the necessary cast members together until August or September 2018. This would not have left enough time to complete post-production work such as visual effects for the additional footage before the November 2018 release date.<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> Specifically, Kinberg was looking to rework the third act of the film, and re-wrote part of the script ahead of the reshoots. With post-production already underway, the film was believed to have been under-budget, while the planned reshoots would cost less than $10{{nbsp}}million. Additionally, Kinberg and the studio had been looking to change the film's release date for \"some time\" to avoid competing with the Christmas-oriented film ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''. The new February release date was noted as having the film opening away from other major studio films, while placing it on [[President's Day]] weekend, which had proved to be successful for ''Deadpool'' and Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.<ref name=\"THRReshoots\" /> Addressing the reshoots, Kinberg confirmed the scheduling delays, and described the photography as a \"normal\" part of the film's creation that would allow him \"enough time to have it ready and looking perfect.\"<ref name=\"KinbergReshoots\" />\n\nAt the end of April, a Fox panel at the 2018 CinemaCon revealed the first logo for the film. It did not include \"''X-Men''\" in the title, but included a circle around the 'X' in ''Dark Phoenix'' which was compared to the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' logo;<ref name=\"FirstLogo\" /> the film was later confirmed to be simply titled ''Dark Phoenix'' in the United States, and ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix'' for release internationally.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> By that August, the reshoots were expected to take place in Montreal over two-and-a-half weeks, though the Quebec Film and Television Bureau believed that these reshoots would take up to three months to complete, due to scheduling conflicts among the cast members.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /><ref name=\"ColliderReshootsAug2018\" /> The reshoots were set to take place at MTL Grand\u00e9 studios since MELS Studios was reserved for another production during the reshoot period,<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> and had begun by August 31.<ref name=\"ReshootsBegin\" /> At the end of September, after the release of the film's first trailer, Fox again delayed the film's release, setting it for June 7, 2019. This date was seen as a better time to release the film in China, where the trailer received more attention than in the United States, while also allowing it to take advantage of premium screens that had previously been reserved for Fox's newly-delayed and later canceled ''[[Gambit (unproduced film)|Gambit]]'' film.<ref name=\"Sep2018ReleaseDelay\" /><ref name=\"DisneyMay2019ScheduleUpdate\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/gambit-movie-dead/ |title=\u2018Gambit\u2019 Is Dead; Disney Drops the X-Men Spinoff from the Schedule |website=[[Collider]] |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |date=May 7, 2019 |accessdate=May 7, 2019 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/78CX9lkfJ |archive-date=May 7, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The move was also reportedly to appease [[James Cameron]], who had ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' moved from December to February and did not want competition from another Fox would-be blockbuster; Kinberg and ''Dark Phoenix'' producers opposed the change as the film was not made for a summer and was facing heavy competition.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"We Were Wrong\": Behind Fox's ''Dark Phoenix'' Debacle |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/we-were-wrong-behind-dark-phoenix-foxs-dismal-x-men-franchise-finale-plans-1216859 |access-date=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, [[Lana Condor]] revealed that she was unable to return as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] due to her commitment to the film ''[[To All the Boys I've Loved Before (film)|To All the Boys I've Loved Before]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"CondorCollider\" /> [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]] serves as editor for the film.<ref name=\"EditorSmith\" /> Visual effects were provided by [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]], MELS, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Rodeo FX]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Soho VFX, with Phil Brennan serving as the main visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VisualEffects\" />\n\n==Music==\nEvan Peters stated in January 2018 that [[Hans Zimmer]] was composing the score for the film,<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /> despite Zimmer having said in March 2016 that he would not score another superhero film following his experience working on ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.<ref name=\"ZimmerNoSupers\" /> Zimmer later explained that in conversations with director [[Ron Howard]] he was convinced to not keep a \"blanket\" view, and to focus on waiting for the right story rather than avoiding an entire genre.

and later released on home media as '''''X-Men: Dark Phoenix''''') is a 2019 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[X-Men]] characters. It is a sequel to 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', the seventh mainline installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the twelfth entry in the franchise overall. The film is written and directed by [[Simon Kinberg]] (in his feature directorial debut) and stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring <!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->[[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Sophie Turner]], [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Alexandra Shipp]], and [[Jessica Chastain]]<!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->. In ''Dark Phoenix'', the X-Men are forced to face the full power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] after a mission in space goes wrong.\n\nAfter ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) erased the events of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) from the [[X-Men (film series)|series']] timeline, Kinberg expressed interest in a new adaptation of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\" in a future film that would be more faithful than his previous attempt with ''The Last Stand'', which was not well received, and even he and writer [[Zak Penn]] were equally unhappy with how it turned out. The new adaptation was confirmed as a follow-up to ''Apocalypse'' in 2016. Kinberg signed on to make his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] in June 2017, when the majority of the cast was set to return from ''Apocalypse''. Filming began later that month in [[Montreal]] and was completed in October 2017; the entire third act was later reshot in late 2018, following poor test screenings. The film was dedicated to the memory of ''X-Men'' co-creator [[Stan Lee]], who died in 2018.\n\n''Dark Phoenix'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 7, 2019, produced by [[20th Century Fox]], and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. It grossed $252{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a $200-million budget and became the lowest-grossing installment in the series. It also received generally unfavorable reviews from critics with various critical takes; many viewed it as a disappointing and anticlimactic conclusion to Fox's ''X-Men'' series although the performances of the cast and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score were praised.<ref name=\"Reviews1\" /><ref name=\"Reviews2\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, eight-year-old [[Jean Grey]] and her parents get into a car accident that kills her mother. Shortly afterward, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] takes her to [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] because her father was afraid of her.\n\nIn 1992, the [[X-Men]] respond to a distress signal from the [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], which is critically damaged by solar flare-like energy during the [[STS-49]] mission. While they save the astronauts, Jean is stranded and struck by the energy which she absorbs into her body to save her team's aircraft from destruction. She survives the event, and her psychic powers are greatly amplified as a result, but they become uncontrollable, and she accidentally unleashes her power on mutants celebrating the victory at Xavier's school. Xavier had placed mental walls in Jean's mind as a girl to protect her psychic mind from experiencing trauma; these are destroyed by Jean's enhanced power, and the trauma slowly returns, resulting in her being full of rage and pain. She travels to her childhood hometown after finding out that her father is still alive and learns that he abandoned her. Jean recovers her complete memory of the car accident and remembers that she had inadvertently caused it rendering her mother unconscious at the wheel with her telepathy, which causes her to develop [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. The X-Men arrive and attempt to take Jean home, but she uses her power against [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme]], injuring the former and killing the latter, before fleeing.\n\nJean travels to the mutant refugee island of [[Genosha]] to seek assistance from [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] in controlling her rage but is turned away by him after she engages in combat with U.S. military forces tasked with her arrest. Jean meets Vuk, the leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]]. She explains to Jean that she has bonded with [[Phoenix Force (comics)|a force of cosmic power]] that wiped out the D'Bari home planet long ago. The power had consumed all those it came across until it was drawn to Jean. Meanwhile, [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], mad with grief by Raven's death, allies with Erik and the mutant refugees in an attempt to kill Jean in [[New York City]].\n\nUpon learning of Erik's plan, the X-Men try to stop him and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|his faction of mutants]]. As they battle, Erik manages to enter the building and confront Jean, only to fall to her amplified powers. Xavier then enters the building with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]]. Jean attacks them until Xavier convinces her to read his memories &ndash; allowing her personality to resurface. Feeling remorseful, Jean offers to let Vuk take the force from her; however, it is revealed that doing so would kill Jean, as well as revealing that Vuk also intends to use the force to conquer Earth. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] are able to prevent Vuk from fully absorbing the force from Jean, though Jean loses consciousness from the ordeal. Troops sent by the U.S. government, who use stun weapons and power-inhibiting collars, attack and subdue both mutant factions, who are placed on a train headed towards a containment facility.\n\nOn the train, Xavier admits to Hank that the latter was right in his earlier accusations of violating Jean's mind. The train is attacked by Vuk and her D'Bari forces. When the soldiers are overpowered by the shape-shifters, the mutants are freed from their restraints to combat the threat. The mutants deal with most of the D'Bari attackers, but Vuk arrives and heads for Jean, defeating each mutant who attempts to stop her. Xavier confers with Jean within his mind, allowing Jean to gain control of her power. After forgiving Xavier, Jean saves the mutants from Vuk's attacks and the ensuing train wreck before proceeding to disintegrate the remaining D'Bari when they attack her. Vuk once again attempts to drain Jean of the force, but Jean takes Vuk into outer space, retakes the power that Vuk had received earlier, and then kills her. Jean then disappears in a burst of energy in the form of a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, Xavier's school is renamed the \"Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters\", and Hank becomes their new dean with Xavier having retired. While settling himself in [[Paris]], Xavier is reunited with Erik and agrees to play a game of chess with him. As they start playing, a flaming phoenix appears in the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Dark Phoenix cast.jpg|140|1150|The cast of ''Dark Phoenix'' promoting the film at the 2019 [[WonderCon]].

Many of the characters in the film turn against Xavier as some of his decisions regarding Jean Grey's abilities are revealed. Director [[Simon Kinberg]] felt that the character always acts out of concern for the \"greater good,\" though he may make some \"misguided\" choices at times. Kinberg hoped that each character would come across as having \"a valid point of view\" in the film.<ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" />\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]: <br />Quicksilver's father and a powerful mutant who can control [[magnetic field]]s and manipulate metal, he is Xavier's former best friend and often rival.

Lawrence described her role in the film as more maternal than before, as she leads the younger X-Men.<ref name=\"EWLawrence\" /> The film continues growing the schism between Mystique and Xavier, with Mystique not approving of some of Xavier's methods, though Kinberg hoped that this would be more subtle in ''Dark Phoenix'' than in previous ''X-Men'' films. The film also sees the character change between appearing as Raven and Mystique more than previously, with each change having a specific meaning to the character and story.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> She continues to have feelings for Beast.\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy / Beast]]: <br />A mutant with a beastly appearance and superhuman physical abilities. He is a teacher at Xavier's School and helps lead the younger X-Men. He continues to have feelings for Mystique.\n* [[Sophie Turner]] as [[Jean Grey]] / [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]: <br />An extremely powerful mutant with telepathic and [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers who is one of Xavier's most prized students. The [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix entity]] is unleashed in the film, leading to a fight between the two personalities for control. Turner studied [[dissociative identity disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]] for the role, particularly for scenes where she has to change from the vulnerable Jean to the confident Phoenix.<ref name=\"EWTurner\" /> Kinberg said Turner has the lead role in the film, a first for the actress.<ref name=\"ChastainTHR\" /> Summer Fontana portrays a young Jean Grey.\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers / Cyclops]]: <br />A mutant who fires concussive optic beams. The film develops his relationship with Jean Grey, which Kinberg called \"a huge part of the emotional core of the movie.\" This forces the character to become a leader in the film,<ref name=\"JeanScott\" /> as he is the most prominent character who holds on to hope as Jean grows more unstable.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Alexandra Shipp]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe / Storm]]: <br />An African mutant who can control the weather.\n* [[Evan Peters]] as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff / Quicksilver]]: <br />Magneto's mutant son who can move at [[Speedster (fiction)|superhuman speed]].

The studio chose to adapt the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" as only one of the film's \"parallel storylines\", with an executive at [[20th Century Fox]] suggesting that the \"[[Gifted (comics)|Gifted]]\" storyline also be in that film.<ref name=\"KinbergX3\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicmix.com/news/2008/04/15/interview-zak-penn-on-the-grand-x-men-fans-and-co-writing-hulk/ |title=INTERVIEW: ZAK PENN ON THE GRAND, X-MEN FANS AND CO-WRITING HULK |access-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> This version of the story was not well received by fans and critics. Kinberg stated that he and Penn were ultimately unhappy with how the adaptation turned out as well.<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" />\n\nAfter the timeline of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' franchise]] was [[retconned]] with the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', it was noted that a new adaptation of the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" could be made that ignores the events of ''The Last Stand''. Kinberg and Singer both expressed interest in the prospect, and hinted that 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' would set up elements for a retelling. ''Apocalypse'' introduces [[Sophie Turner]] as a young Jean Grey, and begins exploring \"how powerful she is.\"<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" /> By April 2016, the sequel to ''Apocalypse'' was believed to indeed re-adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga.\"<ref name=\"HHApr2016\" /> In May 2016, Kinberg said that the next ''X-Men'' film after ''Apocalypse'' would be set in the 1990s, advancing one decade, as had been done for each of the previous few ''X-Men'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergMay2016\" /> He also noted that ''Apocalypse'' had introduced younger versions of several characters from the original ''X-Men'' films to give them a new [[origin story]]\u2014including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and Jean Grey\u2014with the intention of then exploring them in their own line of films. He added that he also hoped to see the cast of the previous trilogy of films return, namely [[James McAvoy]] as [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], [[Michael Fassbender]] as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, and [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkh\u00f6lme / Mystique]].<ref name=\"CastHopes\" />\n\nIn July, Kinberg said he would begin writing the next mainline ''X-Men'' film \"real soon\".<ref name=\"KinbergJul2016\" /> That November, Fox was said to be pressing \"the reset button\" on the franchise due to the financial and critical under-performance of ''Apocalypse'', with the franchise being reconfigured and Singer not returning to direct the next film. McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, and [[Nicholas Hoult]]'s contracts from the previous trilogy had ended, but Kinberg was optimistically writing the new script with them in mind.<ref name=\"UniversePlans\" /> It was rumored in February 2017 that the next film would be titled ''X-Men: Supernova'', and would begin filming that June.<ref name=\"Supernova\" /> Also in February, Turner confirmed that she would return for the film.<ref name=\"TurnerFeb2017\" /> Kinberg was believed to be interested in making his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] with the film,<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb2017\" /> and was described as the top contender for the job with interest from Fox. The studio was also looking to negotiate new deals with Lawrence, Fassbender, McAvoy, and Hoult to return.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20172\" /> By the end of the month, Kinberg described reports that he may direct the film as \"premature,\" but added that if he were to direct, he would not be daunted by the scale of the film due to his experience writing and producing many of the other ''X-Men'' films. He also reiterated that he would adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\" differently to how it was for ''The Last Stand'' if given another opportunity to do so.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20173\" />\n\n===Writing and original two-part plan===\n\nSimon Kinberg wanted a two-film story,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/olivia-munn-interview-lego-ninjago-movie-x-men-dark-phoenix/|title=Olivia Munn on 'The LEGO Ninjago Movie' & Returning for 'X-Men: Dark Phoenix'|first=Christina|last=Radish|date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> but in late pre-production, the studio canceled the second film, and Kinberg had to make major changes to the first film\u2019s script.<ref name=\"deadline-bomb\">{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/06/dark-phoenix-bombs-at-the-box-office-reasons-why-1202629749/|title=\u2018Dark Phoenix\u2019 Bound To Lose $100M+ After Worst Domestic Opening In \u2018X-Men\u2019 Series: Here\u2019s Why|first1=Anthony|last1=D'Alessandro|first2=Anthony|last2=D'Alessandro|date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> Chris Claremont also confirmed the two-film plan and revealed that they would have been titled ''Phoenix'' and ''Dark Phoenix''.

It becomes a \"fight for Jean's soul\" and features a twist that was intended to have significant repercussions on the entire franchise.<ref name=\"EWCover\" /> Lawrence revealed that she had worked to convince Kinberg to direct the film, and had promised to return for it if he did so, despite her dislike of the make-up required to portray her character.<ref name=\"EWLawrence2\" /> It was also revealed then that the film would introduce a version of the island [[Genosha]], adapted to the film as a mutant refuge led by Magneto;<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> and that it would focus on the female characters more so than previous films in the series, particularly Jean Grey as both the protagonist and antagonist of the film, and Chastain's character, with whom Grey has a complex relationship.<ref name=\"XWomen\" />\n\nFox delayed the film's release in March 2018, pushing it back from November 2, 2018 to February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> This was because Fox and Kinberg wanted to schedule some routine reshoots for the film after receiving feedback from audiences during a test screening, but were not able to get all of the necessary cast members together until August or September 2018. This would not have left enough time to complete post-production work such as visual effects for the additional footage before the November 2018 release date.<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> Specifically, Kinberg was looking to rework the third act of the film, and re-wrote part of the script ahead of the reshoots. With post-production already underway, the film was believed to have been under-budget, while the planned reshoots would cost less than $10{{nbsp}}million. Additionally, Kinberg and the studio had been looking to change the film's release date for \"some time\" to avoid competing with the Christmas-oriented film ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''. The new February release date was noted as having the film opening away from other major studio films, while placing it on [[President's Day]] weekend, which had proved to be successful for ''Deadpool'' and Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.<ref name=\"THRReshoots\" /> Addressing the reshoots, Kinberg confirmed the scheduling delays, and described the photography as a \"normal\" part of the film's creation that would allow him \"enough time to have it ready and looking perfect.\"<ref name=\"KinbergReshoots\" />\n\nAt the end of April, a Fox panel at the 2018 CinemaCon revealed the first logo for the film. It did not include \"''X-Men''\" in the title, but included a circle around the 'X' in ''Dark Phoenix'' which was compared to the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' logo;<ref name=\"FirstLogo\" /> the film was later confirmed to be simply titled ''Dark Phoenix'' in the United States, and ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix'' for release internationally.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> By that August, the reshoots were expected to take place in Montreal over two-and-a-half weeks, though the Quebec Film and Television Bureau believed that these reshoots would take up to three months to complete, due to scheduling conflicts among the cast members.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /><ref name=\"ColliderReshootsAug2018\" /> The reshoots were set to take place at MTL Grand\u00e9 studios since MELS Studios was reserved for another production during the reshoot period,<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> and had begun by August 31.<ref name=\"ReshootsBegin\" /> At the end of September, after the release of the film's first trailer, Fox again delayed the film's release, setting it for June 7, 2019. This date was seen as a better time to release the film in China, where the trailer received more attention than in the United States, while also allowing it to take advantage of premium screens that had previously been reserved for Fox's newly-delayed and later canceled ''[[Gambit (unproduced film)|Gambit]]'' film.<ref name=\"Sep2018ReleaseDelay\" /><ref name=\"DisneyMay2019ScheduleUpdate\">{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/gambit-movie-dead/ |title=\u2018Gambit\u2019 Is Dead; Disney Drops the X-Men Spinoff from the Schedule |website=[[Collider]] |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |date=May 7, 2019 |accessdate=May 7, 2019 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/78CX9lkfJ |archive-date=May 7, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The move was also reportedly to appease [[James Cameron]], who had ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' moved from December to February and did not want competition from another Fox would-be blockbuster; Kinberg and ''Dark Phoenix'' producers opposed the change as the film was not made for a summer and was facing heavy competition.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"We Were Wrong\": Behind Fox's ''Dark Phoenix'' Debacle |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/we-were-wrong-behind-dark-phoenix-foxs-dismal-x-men-franchise-finale-plans-1216859 |access-date=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, [[Lana Condor]] revealed that she was unable to return as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] due to her commitment to the film ''[[To All the Boys I've Loved Before (film)|To All the Boys I've Loved Before]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"CondorCollider\" /> [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]] serves as editor for the film.<ref name=\"EditorSmith\" /> Visual effects were provided by [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]], MELS, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Rodeo FX]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Soho VFX, with Phil Brennan serving as the main visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VisualEffects\" />\n\n==Music==\nEvan Peters stated in January 2018 that [[Hans Zimmer]] was composing the score for the film,<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /> despite Zimmer having said in March 2016 that he would not score another superhero film following his experience working on ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.<ref name=\"ZimmerNoSupers\" /> Zimmer later explained that in conversations with director [[Ron Howard]] he was convinced to not keep a \"blanket\" view, and to focus on waiting for the right story rather than avoiding an entire genre. When Kinberg approached him at a concert to talk about his vision for ''Dark Phoenix'', Zimmer realized that the story was one that he wanted to help tell, and that the film was an opportunity for something that he had always wanted to try in a film score; he decided to join the production.<ref name=\"ZimmerExplanation\" /> In writing the film's score, Zimmer wrote new themes for the X-Men, Magneto, and the Phoenix, and chose to omit previously established themes written by previous composer [[John Ottman]].\n\nOn May 23, 2019, the track \"Extraordinary Being\" by [[Emeli Sand\u00e9]] was released as the official soundtrack.<ref>{{Cite AV Media |last=EmeliSandeVEVO |title=Emeli Sand\u00e9 - Extraordinary Being \u2013 In Collaboration with X-Men: Dark Phoenix |date=May 23, 2019 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnYsk7jfUTE |via= [[YouTube]] |access-date=May 27, 2019}}</ref> The soundtrack was released digitally on June 7.
