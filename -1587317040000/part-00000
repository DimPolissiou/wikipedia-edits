The book follows the events of the film, but includes references to the festival of [[Samhain]].  A prologue provides a possible explanation for Michael's murderous impulses, telling the story of Enda, a disfigured [[Celts|Celtic]] teenager who butchers the [[Druid]] princess Deirdre and her lover as revenge for rejecting him; the king subsequently has his [[Shamanism|shaman]] curse Enda's soul to walk the earth reliving his crime for eternity.  It is later revealed that Michael Myers suffers nightmares about Enda and Deirdre, as did Michael's great-grandfather before shooting two people to death at a Halloween harvest dance in the 1890s.  The novel shows Michael's childhood in more detail; his mother voices concern over her son's anti-social behavior shortly before he murders Judith, and Dr. Loomis notices the boy's effortless control and manipulation of the staff and patients at Smith's Grove during his incarceration. Later in the story, Michael's stalking of Laurie and her friends is depicted as more explicitly sexual than was apparent in the film, with several references to him having an [[erection]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Curtis |last=Richards |title=Halloween |date=October 1979 |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |isbn=978-0553132267}}</ref> Michael returned to the world of literature with the 1981 adaptation of ''Halloween II'' written by [[Dennis Etchison|Jack Martin]]; it was published alongside the first film sequel, with the novel following the film events, with an additional victim, a reporter, added to the novel.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Martin |title=Halloween II |date=1 November 1981 |publisher=Zebra Publishing |isbn=978-0890838648 |authorlink=Dennis Etchison}}</ref> The final novelization to feature Michael was ''Halloween IV'', released October 1988.

While on a class trip at a mental institution in [[Kentucky]], Carpenter visited \"the most serious, mentally ill patients\". Among those patients was a young boy around 12 to 13 years old. The boy gave this \"[[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] stare\", \"a real evil stare\", which Carpenter found \"unsettling\", \"creepy\", and \"completely insane\". Carpenter's experience would inspire the characterization that Loomis would give of Michael to Sheriff Brackett in the original film.

According to him, the way Michael follows girls around and watches them contains a subtext of repressed sexuality. Farrands theorizes that, as a child, Michael became fixated on the murder of his sister Judith, and for his own twisted reasons felt the need to repeat that action over and over again, finding a sister-like figure in Laurie who excited him sexually. He also believes that by making Laurie Michael's literal sister, the sequels took away from the simplicity and relatability of the original ''Halloween''. Nevertheless, when writing ''Curse'', Farrands was tasked with creating a mythology for Michael which defined his motives and why he could not be killed. He says, \"He can't just be a man anymore, he's gone beyond that. He's mythical. He's supernatural. So, I took it from that standpoint that there's something else driving him. A force that goes beyond that five senses that has infected this boy's soul and now is driving him.\" As the script developed and more people became involved, Farrands admits that the film went too far in explaining Michael Myers and that he himself was not completely satisfied with the finished product.<ref name=\"Farrands\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iconsoffright.com/IV_Dan.htm |title=Daniel Farrands interview |website=Icons of Fright |year=2005 |accessdate=2 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nMichael does not speak in the films; the first time audiences ever hear his voice is in the 2007 Rob Zombie reboot. Michael speaks as a child during the beginning of the film, but while in Smith's Grove he stops talking completely. Rob Zombie originally planned to have the adult Michael speak to Laurie in the film's finale, simply saying his childhood nickname for her, \"Boo\". Zombie explained that this version was not used because he was afraid having the character talk at that point would demystify him too much, and because the act of Michael handing Laurie the photograph of them together was enough.<ref name=remakecommentary>{{cite video |people=[[Rob Zombie]] |title=Feature film commentary for [[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]] |medium=DVD |location=United States |publisher=[[Dimension Films]] |date=2007}}</ref>\n\nDescribing aspects of Michael Myers which he wanted to explore in the comic book ''Halloween: Nightdance'', writer Stefan Hutchinson mentions the character's \"bizarre and dark sense of humor\", as seen when he wore a sheet over his head to trick a girl into thinking he was her boyfriend, and the satisfaction he gets from scaring the characters before he murders them, such as letting Laurie know he is stalking her. Hutchinson feels there is a perverse nature to Michael's actions: \"see the difference between how he watches and pursues women to men\".<ref name=HalloweenFeb/> He also suggests that Michael Myers' hometown of Haddonfield is the cause of his behavior, likening his situation to that of [[Jack the Ripper]], citing Myers as a \"product of normal surburbia - all the repressed emotion of fake [[Norman Rockwell]] smiles\". Hutchinson describes Michael as a \"monster of abjection\". When asked his opinion of Rob Zombie's expansion on Michael's family life, Hutchinson says that explaining why Michael does what he does \"[reduces] the character\". That being said, Hutchinson explores the nature of evil in the short story ''Charlie''\u2014included in the ''Halloween Nightdance'' trade paperback\u2014and says that Michael Myers spent 15 years \"attuning himself to this force to the point where he is, as Loomis says, 'pure evil'\".<ref name=\"CinemaCrazed\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cinema-crazed.com/r-z/stefhutchinson-interview.htm |title=Rewriting Halloween: Interview with Comics Scribe Stefan Hutchinson |website=Cinema Crazed |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017072911/http://www.cinema-crazed.com/r-z/stefhutchinson-interview.htm |archivedate=17 October 2008 }}</ref> ''Nightdance'' artist [[Tim Seeley]] describes the character's personality in John Carpenter's 1978 film as \"a void\", which allows the character to be more open to interpretation than the later sequels allowed him.

In the original ''Halloween'', the adult Michael Myers, referred to as '''The Shape''' in the closing credits, was portrayed by [[Nick Castle]] for most of the film, with [[Tony Moran (actor)|Tony Moran]] and [[Tommy Lee Wallace]] substituting in the final scenes.

The book follows the events of the film, but includes references to the festival of [[Samhain]].  A prologue provides a possible explanation for Michael's murderous impulses, telling the story of Enda, a disfigured [[Celts|Celtic]] teenager who butchers the [[Druid]] princess Deirdre and her lover as revenge for rejecting him; the king subsequently has his [[Shamanism|shaman]] curse Enda's soul to walk the earth reliving his crime for eternity.  It is later revealed that Michael Myers suffers nightmares about Enda and Deirdre, as did Michael's great-grandfather before shooting two people to death at a Halloween harvest dance in the 1890s.  The novel shows Michael's childhood in more detail; his mother voices concern over her son's anti-social behavior shortly before he murders Judith, and Dr. Loomis notices the boy's effortless control and manipulation of the staff and patients at Smith's Grove during his incarceration. Later in the story, Michael's stalking of Laurie and her friends is depicted as more explicitly sexual than was apparent in the film, with several references to him having an [[erection]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Curtis |last=Richards |title=Halloween |date=October 1979 |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |isbn=978-0553132267}}</ref> Michael returned to the world of literature with the 1981 adaptation of ''Halloween II'' written by [[Dennis Etchison|Jack Martin]]; it was published alongside the first film sequel, with the novel following the film events, with an additional victim, a reporter, added to the novel.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Martin |title=Halloween II |date=1 November 1981 |publisher=Zebra Publishing |isbn=978-0890838648 |authorlink=Dennis Etchison}}</ref> The final novelization to feature Michael was ''Halloween IV'', released October 1988.

The main character in the comic is Lindsey Wallace, the young girl who first saw Michael Myers alongside Tommy Doyle in the original 1978 film.

Written by Stefan Hutchinson, ''Nightdance'' takes place in Russellville, and follows Michael's obsession with Lisa Thomas, a girl who reminds him of his sister Judith.  Lisa is afraid of the dark after Michael trapped her in a basement for days, and years later, he starts sending her disturbing, childlike drawings and murdering those around her on Halloween.  Meanwhile, Ryan Nichols is hunting Michael down after seeing him attack and kidnap his wife.

While on a class trip at a mental institution in [[Kentucky]], Carpenter visited \"the most serious, mentally ill patients\". Among those patients was a young boy around 12 to 13 years old. The boy gave this \"[[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] stare\", \"a real evil stare\", which Carpenter found \"unsettling\", \"creepy\", and \"completely insane\". Carpenter's experience would inspire the characterization that Loomis would give of Michael to Sheriff Brackett in the original film. Debra Hill has stated the scene where Michael kills a [[German Shepherd]] was done to illustrate how he is \"really evil and deadly\".<ref name=\"CutAbove\">{{cite video |people=John Carpenter, Debra Hill, Nick Castle, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Tommy Lee Wallace |title=A Cut Above the Rest (Halloween: 25th Anniversary Edition DVD Special Features) |medium=DVD (Region 2) |location=United States |publisher=[[Starz Home Entertainment|Anchor Bay]] |date=2003}}</ref>\n\nThe ending scene of Michael being shot six times, and then disappearing after falling off the balcony, was meant to make the audience's imaginations run wild. Carpenter tried to keep the audience guessing as to who Michael Myers really is\u2014he is gone, and everywhere at the same time; he is more than human; he may be supernatural, and no one knows how he got that way.

And no remorse, it's got no feelings, that's the most frightening, definitely.\" [[Richard Schickel]], film critic for ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', felt Michael was \"irrational\" and \"really angry about something\", having what Schickel referred to as \"a kind of primitive, obsessed intelligence\".

According to him, the way Michael follows girls around and watches them contains a subtext of repressed sexuality. Farrands theorizes that, as a child, Michael became fixated on the murder of his sister Judith, and for his own twisted reasons felt the need to repeat that action over and over again, finding a sister-like figure in Laurie who excited him sexually. He also believes that by making Laurie Michael's literal sister, the sequels took away from the simplicity and relatability of the original ''Halloween''. Nevertheless, when writing ''Curse'', Farrands was tasked with creating a mythology for Michael which defined his motives and why he could not be killed. He says, \"He can't just be a man anymore, he's gone beyond that. He's mythical. He's supernatural. So, I took it from that standpoint that there's something else driving him. A force that goes beyond that five senses that has infected this boy's soul and now is driving him.\" As the script developed and more people became involved, Farrands admits that the film went too far in explaining Michael Myers and that he himself was not completely satisfied with the finished product.<ref name=\"Farrands\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iconsoffright.com/IV_Dan.htm |title=Daniel Farrands interview |website=Icons of Fright |year=2005 |accessdate=2 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nMichael does not speak in the films; the first time audiences ever hear his voice is in the 2007 Rob Zombie reboot. Michael speaks as a child during the beginning of the film, but while in Smith's Grove he stops talking completely. Rob Zombie originally planned to have the adult Michael speak to Laurie in the film's finale, simply saying his childhood nickname for her, \"Boo\". Zombie explained that this version was not used because he was afraid having the character talk at that point would demystify him too much, and because the act of Michael handing Laurie the photograph of them together was enough.<ref name=remakecommentary>{{cite video |people=[[Rob Zombie]] |title=Feature film commentary for [[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]] |medium=DVD |location=United States |publisher=[[Dimension Films]] |date=2007}}</ref>\n\nDescribing aspects of Michael Myers which he wanted to explore in the comic book ''Halloween: Nightdance'', writer Stefan Hutchinson mentions the character's \"bizarre and dark sense of humor\", as seen when he wore a sheet over his head to trick a girl into thinking he was her boyfriend, and the satisfaction he gets from scaring the characters before he murders them, such as letting Laurie know he is stalking her. Hutchinson feels there is a perverse nature to Michael's actions: \"see the difference between how he watches and pursues women to men\".<ref name=HalloweenFeb/> He also suggests that Michael Myers' hometown of Haddonfield is the cause of his behavior, likening his situation to that of [[Jack the Ripper]], citing Myers as a \"product of normal surburbia - all the repressed emotion of fake [[Norman Rockwell]] smiles\". Hutchinson describes Michael as a \"monster of abjection\". When asked his opinion of Rob Zombie's expansion on Michael's family life, Hutchinson says that explaining why Michael does what he does \"[reduces] the character\". That being said, Hutchinson explores the nature of evil in the short story ''Charlie''\u2014included in the ''Halloween Nightdance'' trade paperback\u2014and says that Michael Myers spent 15 years \"attuning himself to this force to the point where he is, as Loomis says, 'pure evil'\".<ref name=\"CinemaCrazed\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cinema-crazed.com/r-z/stefhutchinson-interview.htm |title=Rewriting Halloween: Interview with Comics Scribe Stefan Hutchinson |website=Cinema Crazed |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017072911/http://www.cinema-crazed.com/r-z/stefhutchinson-interview.htm |archivedate=17 October 2008 }}</ref> ''Nightdance'' artist [[Tim Seeley]] describes the character's personality in John Carpenter's 1978 film as \"a void\", which allows the character to be more open to interpretation than the later sequels allowed him.

It was originally written for the film ''[[Maxim Perepelitsa]]'' starring [[Leonid Bykov]]. The movie itself was released in 1955, and the song has achieved fame and popularity independently of it ever since.

The explosion killed Angela Taylor, the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty. The materials for the bomb were stolen from Tyrconnel Mine. Several men were arrested for suspected involvement with the bombing. Stanley Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.  Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, which involved a shootout with police officers injuring himself and an officer. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\n==Explosion==\n[[File:1978-1980 Holden VB Commodore 01.jpg|thumb|left|A Holden Commodore, like the one used in the Russell Street bombing]]\nThe explosion was caused by a [[car bomb]] hidden in a stolen 1979 [[Holden Commodore]], (bearing Victoria [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | registration plate]]; AVQ-508). The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million.  ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path. The blast seriously injured 21-year-old  [[Constable|Police Constable]] Angela Taylor, who died on 20 April, becoming the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/03/24/1143083990293.html|title=Remembering the day Russell Street shook|work=The Age|date=25 March 2006|accessdate=12 March 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-24/scars-still-felt-20-years-after-russell-street-bombing/7264058 Scars still felt 30 years after Russell Street bombing], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 24 March 2016</ref> 22 other people were injured.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Investigations==\nOn 7 October 1985, [[gelignite]] and [[detonator]]s were stolen from the Tyrconnel Mine at Blackwood.

The motive for the bombing seems to have been revenge against the police.<ref>[http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/ergo/russell_street_bombing The Russell Street bombing], slv.vic.gov.au; accessed 10 February 2016.</ref>\n\nA week after the bombing, on 4 April 1986, a anonymous caller had contacted Police Commissioner; [[Mick Miller (police officer) |Mick Miller]] stating that they had footage of the offenders responsible just before the explosion, the caller then stated they wanted [[Australian dollar | AU$]]500,000 for the information. The caller called Commissioner Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Commissioner Miller and Victoria's  Premier[[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Commissioner Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, in a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table, making him a prime suspect, He was later arrested in Sydney on the 15 April 1986. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria | St. Albans]] where he had carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of[[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed (born Peter Komiazyk) was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided the house of Karl Zelinka; an associate of both Reed and the Minogue brothers in [[Nunawading, Victoria |Nunawading]]. Evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka (who had no criminal record) admitted that he saw Craig Minogue drive an Commodore identical to the one used in the bombing into the garage of the Zelinka's home. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney for the Easter Holiday just before the bombing occurred with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue Brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka's home.\n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited multiple on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor had a extensive criminal record dating back to 1946 when at the age of 8, he was sent to Bayswater Boys Home at [[The Basin, Victoria | The Basin]] for two years. In 1949 when he was 12, he was convicted for fishing in prohibited area. In the early 1960s, Taylor was convicted of a armed robbery at [[Milk bar | milk bar]] in [[Clayton, Victoria | Clayton]] and sent to [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division. While in prison, Taylor met [[Ronald Ryan]]; the last man hanged in Australia. Ryan had asked Taylor to accompanied him on his escape but Taylor refused. After Ryan was hanged, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge, while on the run, Taylor committed seven bank robberies over a period of five days before being recaptured and sent back to prison.      \n\nWhile in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and was released in 1978. After his release, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. Taylor was also a bit actor, in 1979, he starred in an episode of [[Prisoner (TV series) | Prisoner]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/russell-street-bomber-the-dying-embers-of-hate-20150611-ghlatl.html|title=Russell Street Bomber: the dying embers of hate|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2015-06-11|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nWith Zelinka's statement and corroborating evidence, detectives arrested Taylor at his home in [[Birchip, Victoria | Birchip]] on the 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any crime.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nThe Crown did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Holden Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (ie never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years. Although Minogue thus became eligible for parole in 2016, the Victorian Parliament has twice legislated to keep him in prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/new-laws-set-to-keep-russell-street-bomber-craig-minogue-behind-bars-for-life-20180723-p4zt6b.html|title=New laws set to keep Russell Street bomber Craig Minogue behind bars for life|last=Cunningham|first=Melissa|date=2018-07-23|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> Minogue and Reed have both been recently charged with sexual assault offences that allegedly occurred just prior to the bombing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-23/russell-street-bomber-and-acquitted-man-charged-over-1980s-rapes/11143542|title=Police charge Russell Street bomber over cold case gang rape|last=Asher|first=Nicole|last2=staff|date=2019-05-23|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn 1995, police headquarters moved to the Victoria Police Centre with the old headquarters many years later redeveloped into an apartment complex.{{cn|date=August 2016}} Wylie, who was shot by Reed, later recovered from his wounds, but eventually left the police force; in July 2014, he died by suicide, aged 61.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/russell-street-bombing-claims-last-victim-20140718-3c6k4.html|title=Russell Street Bombing claims last victim|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2014-07-19|work=The Age|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n* ''[[Phoenix (TV series)|Phoenix]]'' \u2013 a 1992\u20131993 13-part Australian police drama television series loosely based on the Russell Street bombing\n* The case was covered by ''[[Casefile True Crime Podcast]]'' on 2 and 9 July 2016.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Explosions in 1986]]\n[[Category:March 1986 events in Oceania]]\n[[Category:History of Melbourne]]\n[[Category:1986 crimes in Australia]]\n[[Category:Murder in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Car and truck bombings in Australia]]\n[[Category:Organised crime events in Australia]]\n[[Category:Attacks on police stations]]\n[[Category:1980s in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:1980s murders in Australia]]\n[[Category:1986 murders in Oceania]]\n[[Category:Terrorist incidents in Australia in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:Terrorist incidents in Oceania in 1986]]\n[[Category:Murdered Australian police officers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{update|date=July 2014}}\n{{BLP sources|date=March 2012}}\n\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2011}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=March 2018}}\n{{Infobox civilian attack\n|title= Russell Street bombing\n|image= RussellStreetPoliceHQ.JPG|caption=Russell Street Police Headquarters\n|location= [[Russell Street Police Headquarters]], [[Russell Street, Melbourne|Russell Street]], [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]\n|date= 27 March 1986\n| time        = 1:00 pm\n| timezone    = [[GMT]]+11\n|coordinates = {{coord|37|48|29.85|S|144|57|58.19|E|type:landmark_region:AU|display=inline}}\n|type= [[Car bomb]]\n|fatalities= 1 ([[Constable]] Angela Taylor)\n|injuries= 22\n|perps= [[Craig Minogue]], and Stanley Brian Taylor<br> were convicted, Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted}}\n\nThe '''Russell Street bombing''' was the 27 March 1986 bombing of the [[Russell Street Police Headquarters]] complex in  [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].

The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million.  ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path. The blast seriously injured 21-year-old  [[Constable|Police Constable]] Angela Taylor, who died on 20 April, becoming the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/03/24/1143083990293.html|title=Remembering the day Russell Street shook|work=The Age|date=25 March 2006|accessdate=12 March 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-24/scars-still-felt-20-years-after-russell-street-bombing/7264058 Scars still felt 30 years after Russell Street bombing], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 24 March 2016</ref> 22 other people were injured.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Investigations==\nOn 7 October 1985, [[gelignite]] and [[detonator]]s were stolen from the Tyrconnel Mine at Blackwood.

The motive for the bombing seems to have been revenge against the police.<ref>[http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/ergo/russell_street_bombing The Russell Street bombing], slv.vic.gov.au; accessed 10 February 2016.</ref>\n\nA week after the bombing, on 4 April 1986, a anonymous caller had contacted Police Commissioner; [[Mick Miller (police officer) |Mick Miller]] stating that they had footage of the offenders responsible just before the explosion, the caller then stated they wanted [[Australian dollar | AU$]]500,000 for the information. The caller called Commissioner Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Commissioner Miller and Victoria's  Premier[[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Commissioner Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, in a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table, making him a prime suspect, He was later arrested in Sydney on the 15 April 1986. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria | St. Albans]] where he had carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of[[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed (born Peter Komiazyk) was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided the house of Karl Zelinka; an associate of both Reed and the Minogue brothers in [[Nunawading, Victoria |Nunawading]]. Evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka (who had no criminal record) admitted that he saw Craig Minogue drive an Commodore identical to the one used in the bombing into the garage of the Zelinka's home. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney for the Easter Holiday just before the bombing occurred with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue Brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka's home.\n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited multiple on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor had a extensive criminal record dating back to 1946 when at the age of 8, he was sent to Bayswater Boys Home at [[The Basin, Victoria, The Basin]] for two years. In 1949 when he was 12, he was convicted for fishing in prohibited area. In the early 1960s, Taylor was convicted of a armed robbery at [[Milk bar | milk bar]] in [[Clayton, Victoria | Clayton]] and sent to [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division. While in prison, Taylor met [[Ronald Ryan]]; the last man hanged in Australia. Ryan had asked Taylor to accompanied him on his escape but Taylor refused. After Ryan was hanged, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge, while on the run, Taylor committed seven bank robberies over a period of five days before being recaptured and sent back to prison.      \n\nWhile in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and was released in 1978. After his release, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. Taylor was also a bit actor, in 1979, he starred in an episode of [[Prisoner (TV series) | Prisoner]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/russell-street-bomber-the-dying-embers-of-hate-20150611-ghlatl.html|title=Russell Street Bomber: the dying embers of hate|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2015-06-11|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nWith Zelinka's statement and corroborating evidence, detectives arrested Taylor at his home in [[Birchip, Victoria | Birchip]] on the 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any crime.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nThe Crown did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Holden Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (ie never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years. Although Minogue thus became eligible for parole in 2016, the Victorian Parliament has twice legislated to keep him in prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/new-laws-set-to-keep-russell-street-bomber-craig-minogue-behind-bars-for-life-20180723-p4zt6b.html|title=New laws set to keep Russell Street bomber Craig Minogue behind bars for life|last=Cunningham|first=Melissa|date=2018-07-23|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> Minogue and Reed have both been recently charged with sexual assault offences that allegedly occurred just prior to the bombing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-23/russell-street-bomber-and-acquitted-man-charged-over-1980s-rapes/11143542|title=Police charge Russell Street bomber over cold case gang rape|last=Asher|first=Nicole|last2=staff|date=2019-05-23|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn 1995, police headquarters moved to the Victoria Police Centre with the old headquarters many years later redeveloped into an apartment complex.{{cn|date=August 2016}} Wylie, who was shot by Reed, later recovered from his wounds, but eventually left the police force; in July 2014, he died by suicide, aged 61.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/russell-street-bombing-claims-last-victim-20140718-3c6k4.html|title=Russell Street Bombing claims last victim|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2014-07-19|work=The Age|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n* ''[[Phoenix (TV series)|Phoenix]]'' \u2013 a 1992\u20131993 13-part Australian police drama television series loosely based on the Russell Street bombing\n* The case was covered by ''[[Casefile True Crime Podcast]]'' on 2 and 9 July 2016.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Explosions in 1986]]\n[[Category:March 1986 events in Oceania]]\n[[Category:History of Melbourne]]\n[[Category:1986 crimes in Australia]]\n[[Category:Murder in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Car and truck bombings in Australia]]\n[[Category:Organised crime events in Australia]]\n[[Category:Attacks on police stations]]\n[[Category:1980s in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:1980s murders in Australia]]\n[[Category:1986 murders in Oceania]]\n[[Category:Terrorist incidents in Australia in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:Terrorist incidents in Oceania in 1986]]\n[[Category:Murdered Australian police officers]]\n", "name_user": "Jpts1107", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eArrests", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Street_bombing"}
