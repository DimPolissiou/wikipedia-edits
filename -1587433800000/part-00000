The Soviet Union insisted the ceded areas be  completely evacuated in 10 days. The evacuees were partly compensated for their losses; farmers, for example, received land in proportion to their earlier holdings. Usually, the compensation was about one third of the original farm. Compensation for movable property was much less. However, all evacuee families had a right to receive a small farm, and/or a plot for a detached house or a flat. The land used for these grants was confiscated by the state from municipalities and private owners. Financial compensation was funded by a general property tax of 10 to 30%, levied over a period of several years.<ref>[http://aluepalautus.net/uusi/arkisto/2003/15092003a.htm Karjalan suomalaistilojen korvaukset Sodan j\u00e4lkeeen.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408061845/http://aluepalautus.net/uusi/arkisto/2003/15092003a.htm |date=2008-04-08 }} Reino Paju 9-15-2003.

In Russia, people associate the word \"Karelia\" with the [[Republic of Karelia]] instead of [[Finnish Karelia]], which makes conducting polls more difficult. In a 1999 poll by [[MTV3]], 34% of the people of [[Vyborg]] supported returning Karelia to Finland and 57% were opposed. [[Vyborg]] and the rest of the ceded Karelia outside the [[Republic of Karelia]] nowadays contain very few ethnic Finns, and is almost exclusively inhabited by people who moved there during the Soviet era and their descendants.\n\nIn the latest poll in Finland about the question, 36 percent of Finns supported the return of ceded territories, compared to 51% who are opposed. The poll was conducted by the newspaper ''Karjala'' and the research institute ''MC-Info Oy'' on 13 October 2005. In August 2005, a poll by ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' and Suomen [[Gallup International Association|Gallup]], determined that 30% of Finns supported and 62% opposed the return.<ref name=\"HS Gallup\">[http://www.hs.fi/uutiset/tuoreet/artikkeli/1101980677358 HS-Gallup: Selv\u00e4 enemmist\u00f6 ei halua Karjalaa takaisin]</ref> In a poll by Taloustutkimus and Karjalan Liitto conducted in May 2005, support was 26% while 58% were opposed.<ref>[http://www.karjalanliitto.fi/3/taloustutkimus.html  Karjalan Liitto and Taloustutkimus] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070623124037/http://www.karjalanliitto.fi/3/taloustutkimus.html |date=2007-06-23 }}</ref> A year earlier, a poll by STT showed 38% supporting and 57% opposing.

According to another poll conducted by ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', 42% of Finns opposing the return list that as the most important single reason. The standard of living on the Russian side of the border is much lower than on the Finnish side. The [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP (PPP) per capita]] in Finland is about double that of Russia.\n\nThe costs of bringing Karelia to the same level with the rest of Finland have been researched only by supporters of the idea. According to a survey conducted by ProKarelia, the area has natural advantages that, under Finnish rule, would make it a centre of trade with Russia and industry and thus bring economic growth fast enough to solve the entire problem. According to both ProKarelian research and Arto Lahti's estimate, the price of return would be about 30 billion [[euro]].<ref name=\"reform\">[http://www.prokarelia.net/en/?x=reform  ProKarelia's Reform]</ref><ref>[http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/cgi-bin/pika/jutut.pl?/arkisto/Arkisto_1999/3.joulukuu/base+1643  Karjalan palauttamisen lasketaan kannattavan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408094839/http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/cgi-bin/pika/jutut.pl?%2Farkisto%2FArkisto_1999%2F3.joulukuu%2Fbase+1643 |date=2008-04-08 }}</ref><ref>Arto Lahti's lecture in Karjala seminar 23 August 2005 [http://prokarelia.net/fi/?x=artikkeli&article_id=656&author=65 abridgement]</ref>\n\n=== Population ===\n[[Image:Sortavalan maaseutua.jpg|thumb|Countryside houses.

The fate of these people is a major issue in discussions of the return of Karelia to Finland. According to the poll by ''Helsingin Sanomat'', 14% of people opposing return consider its greatest flaw the tensions that would be caused by a Russian-speaking minority being formed in Finland. In 2004, there were about 370,000 Russians living in the region.<ref>[http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/html/TOM_01_04_2.htm 2004 Russian Census]</ref>\n\nIf the inhabitants were allowed to stay in their homes, Finland would receive a few hundred thousand new Russian-speaking people with no experience of living in Finnish society. If services for them in their own language were to be provided, Finland would need many more officials capable of speaking Russian. In ProKarelia's vision, nearly half of the Russian population in Karelia would be [[deportation|expelled]] to Russia, and even more would leave if Finland paid their expenses for doing so.<ref name=\"reform\"/> However most of the Russian speaking population of Karelia were born there and have spent all their life in the region.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Continuation War]]\n* [[Former eastern territories of Germany]]\n* [[Greater Finland]]\n* [[Interim Peace]]\n* [[Irredentism]]\n* [[Kaliningrad question]]\n* [[Lapland War]]\n* [[Moscow Armistice]]\n* [[Moscow Peace Treaty]]\n* [[Reunification]]\n* [[Territorial changes of the Baltic states]]\n* [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Finnish)]]\n* [[Unification of Romania and Moldova]]\n* [[Winter War]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=172062&contentlan=2&culture=en-US Saimaa Canal links two Karelias, thisisFINLAND]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131018015359/http://www.hs.fi/english/article/ProKarelia+movement+wants+back+ceded+areas+as+well+as+war+reparations+paid+to+the+Soviet+Union+/1101978717301 Helsingin Sanomat 3 March 2005.

In Russia, people associate the word \"Karelia\" with the [[Republic of Karelia]] instead of [[Finnish Karelia]], which makes conducting polls more difficult. In a 1999 poll by [[MTV3]], 34% of the people of [[Vyborg]] supported returning Karelia to Finland and 57% were opposed. [[Vyborg]] and the rest of the ceded Karelia outside the [[Republic of Karelia]] nowadays contain very few ethnic Finns, and is almost exclusively inhabited by people who moved there during the Soviet era and their descendants.\n\nIn the latest poll in Finland about the question, 36 percent of Finns supported the return of ceded territories, compared to 51% who are opposed. The poll was conducted by the newspaper ''Karjala'' and the research institute ''MC-Info Oy'' on 13 October 2005. In August 2005, a poll by ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' and Suomen [[Gallup International Association|Gallup]], determined that 30% of Finns supported and 62% opposed the return.<ref name=\"HS Gallup\">[http://www.hs.fi/uutiset/tuoreet/artikkeli/1101980677358 HS-Gallup: Selv\u00e4 enemmist\u00f6 ei halua Karjalaa takaisin]</ref> In a poll by Taloustutkimus and Karjalan Liitto conducted in May 2005, support was 26% while 58% were opposed.<ref>[http://www.karjalanliitto.fi/3/taloustutkimus.html  Karjalan Liitto and Taloustutkimus] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070623124037/http://www.karjalanliitto.fi/3/taloustutkimus.html |date=2007-06-23 }}</ref> A year earlier, a poll by STT showed 38% supporting and 57% opposing.

According to another poll conducted by ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', 42% of Finns opposing the return list that as the most important single reason. The standard of living on the Russian side of the border is much lower than on the Finnish side. The [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP (PPP) per capita]] in Finland is about double that of Russia.\n\nThe costs of bringing Karelia to the same level with the rest of Finland have been researched only by supporters of the idea. According to a survey conducted by ProKarelia, the area has natural advantages that, under Finnish rule, would make it a centre of trade with Russia and industry and thus bring economic growth fast enough to solve the entire problem. According to both ProKarelian research and Arto Lahti's estimate, the price of return would be about 30 billion [[euro]].<ref name=\"reform\">[http://www.prokarelia.net/en/?x=reform  ProKarelia's Reform]</ref><ref>[http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/cgi-bin/pika/jutut.pl?/arkisto/Arkisto_1999/3.joulukuu/base+1643  Karjalan palauttamisen lasketaan kannattavan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408094839/http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/cgi-bin/pika/jutut.pl?%2Farkisto%2FArkisto_1999%2F3.joulukuu%2Fbase+1643 |date=2008-04-08 }}</ref><ref>Arto Lahti's lecture in Karjala seminar 23 August 2005 [http://prokarelia.net/fi/?x=artikkeli&article_id=656&author=65 abridgement]</ref>\n\n=== Population ===\n[[Image:Sortavalan maaseutua.jpg|thumb|Countryside houses.

The fate of these people is a major issue in discussions of the return of Karelia to Finland. According to the poll by ''Helsingin Sanomat'', 14% of people opposing return consider its greatest flaw the tensions that would be caused by a Russian-speaking minority being formed in Finland. In 2004, there were about 370,000 Russians living in the region.<ref>[http://www.perepis2002.ru/ct/html/TOM_01_04_2.htm 2004 Russian Census]</ref>\n\nIf the inhabitants were allowed to stay in their homes, Finland would receive a few hundred thousand new Russian-speaking people with no experience of living in Finnish society. If services for them in their own language were to be provided, Finland would need many more officials capable of speaking Russian. In ProKarelia's vision, nearly half of the Russian population in Karelia would be [[deportation|expelled]] to Russia, and even more would leave if Finland paid their expenses for doing so.<ref name=\"reform\"/> However most of the Russian speaking population of Karelia were born there and have spent all their life in the region.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Continuation War]]\n* [[Former eastern territories of Germany]]\n* [[Greater Finland]]\n* [[Interim Peace]]\n* [[Irredentism]]\n* [[Kaliningrad question]]\n* [[Lapland War]]\n* [[Moscow Armistice]]\n* [[Moscow Peace Treaty]]\n* [[Reunification]]\n* [[Territorial changes of the Baltic states]]\n* [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Finnish)]]\n* [[Unification of Romania and Moldova]]\n* [[Winter War]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=172062&contentlan=2&culture=en-US Saimaa Canal links two Karelias, thisisFINLAND]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131018015359/http://www.hs.fi/english/article/ProKarelia+movement+wants+back+ceded+areas+as+well+as+war+reparations+paid+to+the+Soviet+Union+/1101978717301 Helsingin Sanomat 3 March 2005.

It was re-released theatrically in 1976 under the alternate title ''Devil Times Five'', as well as ''Tantrums'' in the United Kingdom. The film follows a group of [[psychopathy|sociopathic]], homicidal children who, accompanied by a mysterious [[nun]], seek refuge with the residents of a lakeside [[chalet]], only to systematically murder them one by one.\n\n== Plot ==\nOn a snowy mountain pass in [[Lake Arrowhead, California]], a van transporting children from a [[psychiatric hospital]] crashes, apparently killing most of its passengers, aside from a young [[nun]], Sister Hannah, and four of the children: Susan, Moe, David, and Brian. The children and Sister Hannah travel on foot, seeking shelter. Meanwhile, in [[Los Angeles]], Julie and her boyfriend Rick embark to Lake Arrowhead to visit her father, Doc, a real estate tycoon, at his lakeside [[chalet]]. \n\nJulie and Rick arrive at the chalet, along with Doc's conniving business associate, Harvey Beckman and his wife, Ruth; Julie witnesses Doc's new young wife, Lovely, attempting to seduce the mentally-disabled house servant, Ralph, and sparks a fight. Meanwhile, the four children break into the [[wine cellar]] at Doc's chalet. Back at the crashed van, the children's physician, Dr. Brown, regains consciousness, and begins frantically searching for the children. He tracks them to the cellar, where the children murder him with Sister Hannah's assistance. They bury his corpse in the snow.\n\nIn the morning, the children surprise the residents of the chalet, and Doc agrees to let them stay one night. In conversation, David tells Harvey that he and the others were on their way to make a film in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] when their van crashed. After dinner that night, David and Brian sneak into Ralph's cabin and disengage the [[Electric generator|generator]]. When Ralph goes to inspect it, he is caught in a [[booby trap]] that strangles him to death.\n\nThe next day, Rick finds Ralph's corpse hanging from a noose in front of the generator. Doc assumes Ralph committed suicide, but Rick suspects the children. He subsequently discovers that Doc's car has been tampered with and that the guns and knives in the house have gone missing; he fears the children are out to do them harm. David, who is adorning himself in makeup and a dress, overhears Rick vocalizing his suspicions. Shortly after, David hacks Harvey to death with an axe while he chops wood outside.\n\nSister Hannah drowns Lovely in a bathtub while Moe sets Doc's pet [[piranhas]] loose in the bathwater to devour her. When Doc witnesses the children dragging Lovely's body through the snow, he chases after them to Ralph's cabin, where he is killed with a knife in another rigged booby trap. Armed with the stolen guns, the children return to the chalet, first attacking Ruth, who begs Susan to let them go; the children douse Ruth in gasoline before Susan throws a lit match onto her, burning her alive. Rick and Julie flee, attempting to escape on a boat, but David forces them back to the chalet at gunpoint, and the two barricade themselves in a second-floor bedroom.\n\nIn the morning, David uses a ladder to reach the bedroom window, and impales Julie through the neck with a pole that he forces through the glass, killing her. Rick, now alone and desperate, witnesses the children gleefully throwing snowballs at Doc's corpse. This sparks rage in Rick, and he decides to confront the children outside, only to be caught in an [[animal trapping|animal trap]]. Sister Hannah slashes Rick's throat with a knife. With all the adults dead, the children drag their bodies into Ralph's cabin and seat them around a table, playing with them as though they are dolls. After a brief time, Susan and Brian declare that it is time to move on. Moe expresses that she wants to continue playing, to which Sister Hannah responds they will find new \"toys.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Sorrell Booke]] as Harvey Beckman\n*[[Gene Evans]] as Papa Doc\n*Taylor Lacher as Rick\n*[[Joan McCall]] as Julie\n*[[Shelley Morrison]] as Ruth\n*Carolyn Stellar as Lovely\n*John Durren as Ralph\n*[[Leif Garrett]] as David\n*Gail Smale as Sister Hannah\n*[[Dawn Lyn]] as Moe\n*[[Tierre Turner]] as Brian\n*Tia Thompson as Susan\n*[[Henry Beckman]] as Dr. Brown\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Peopletoys'' was filmed in [[Lake Arrowhead, California|Lake Arrowhead]] and [[Big Bear Lake, California]] between February and April 1973.<ref name=afi>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/55701|work=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|location=Los Angeles, California|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=People Toys (1974)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200405065602/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/55701|archive-date=April 5, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The production was notably tense between director Sean McGregor and producer Michael Blowitz, with Blowitz recalling that at one point, McGregor punched Blowitz in the face, to which Blowitz responded by throwing McGregor through a plate glass window.{{sfn|Kord|2016|pages=173\u2013174}} \n\nActor Tierre Turner recalled that, for himself and the other child actors, the shoot was \"like a vacation\u2026&nbsp; we were having a great time\"{{sfn|Kord|2016|p=174}}.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States by [[Cinemation Industries]].<ref name=afi/> According to the [[American Film Institute]], no contemporary reviews confirm that the film was released under its original title, ''People Toys'', though a 1974 edition of the film journal ''Screenworld'' reported the film to be due for a June 1974 release.<ref name=afi/> Newspaper showtime listings in the ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'' indicate the film premiered in [[Austin, Texas]] under the title ''People Toys'' on May 17, 1974,<ref name=austin>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/48041017/austin-american-statesman/|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|location=Austin, Texas|title=What's going on...|date=May 12, 1974|via=Newspapers.com|p=2}}</ref> and in [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]] on May 24.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Abilene Reporter-News]]|location=Abilene, Texas|title=Movies Return for Second Showing|last=Miller|first=Alice|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/48041208/abilene-reporter-news/|p=25|date=May 19, 1974|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> It subsequently screened under this title in [[Akron, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|location=Akron, Ohio|title=Outdoor Theatres|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/48041062/the-akron-beacon-journal/|via=Newspapers.com|p=49|date=May 30, 1974}}</ref>\n\nAnother alternate title was ''The Horrible House on the Hill'', for which an undated poster was produced by Cinemation.<ref name=afi/> In 1976, Seymour Borde & Associates purchased international distribution rights to the film, re-releasing it under the alternate title ''Devil Times Five''.<ref name=afi/>\n\n===Critical response===\nCavett Binion of [[AllMovie]] described the film as \"a seldom-seen but thoroughly satisfying horror sleeper with a sardonic sense of morality, taking great delight in knocking off [Gene] Evans' circle of decadent snobs in graphic and innovative ways.\"<ref>{{cite web|work=[[AllMovie]]|title=Devil Times Five (1974)|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/devil-times-five-v13508|last=Binion|first=Cavett|archive-url=http://archive.is/wip/erXBb|archive-date=April 5, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[VHS]] by [[Media Home Entertainment]].

The UDTs and flamethrowing tanks are declassified top secret examples. Post war they followed with more of the same for the CIA and State Department.

[[Richmond K. Turner|Kelly Turner]], commander V Amphibious Corps had ordered a review to get a grip on the problem.  VAC found that the only people having any applicable experience with the material were men in the Naval Construction Battalions.  Lt. Thomas C. Crist (CB 10) was in Pearl Harbor from [[Canton Island]]<ref>Lt Crist, \"The MOCK-UP\", Fort Pierce ATB Newspaper, 20 July 1945 , p. 4, Fort Pierce SEAL Archives, Fort Pierce,  FL</ref><ref>UDTs 1 & 2, The Marshall Islands, Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, Eniwetok, U.

His being in Pearl Harbor was pivotal in [[Underwater Demolition Team|UDT]] history.  While there he learned of the Adm. Turner's interest in coral blasting and made contact.  The Admiral tasked Lt. Crist to develop a method for blasting coral under combat conditions and putting together a team to do it.<ref name=\"UDT Cold\"/>  Lt. Crist started by getting men from CB 10.  By December 1, 1943 he had close to 30 officers and 150 enlisted at [[Waipio]] Amphibious Operating Base on Oahu.<ref name=\"UDT Cold\"/>\n\nIn November the Navy had a hard lesson with underwater obstructions, coral, and tides at [[invasion of Tarawa|Tarawa]]. It prompted Adm. Turner to request the creation of nine [[Underwater Demolition Teams]] to address those issues.<ref>The Underwater Demolition Teams of the Pacific, Pearl Harbor Visitors Bureau, [https://visitpearlharbor.org/the-underwater-demolition-teams-of-the-pacific/]</ref> Six would be assigned to VAC in the Central Pacific while the other three would go to III Amphibious Corps in the South Pacific.

Turner also requested formation of a \"Naval Combat Demolition Training & Experimental Base\" at [[Kihei, Hawaii]].  It was approved, with the lessons of UDT 1 incorporated into the training, making it distinctly different from that at Fort Pierce.  Lt. Crist was briefly the first training officer until when he was made Commander of UDT 3.  When UDT 3 returned from Leyte in November 1944 the team became the training instructors of the school and Lt. Crist was again OIC of training.<ref name=\"viewoftherockies\"/>   Under Lt. Crist the 2-month training course was broken into four 2 week blocks. With an overall emphasis on swimming and reconnaissance the teams also covered night ops, problems of control, small arms, bivouacking, small unit tactics, along with coral and lava blasting.  The team continued instructing until April 1945 when it was sent to Fort Priece to instruct there.  Lt. Crist was promoted to Lt. Cmdr and returned to Hawaii. Team 3 would train teams 12\u201322.<ref name=\"viewoftherockies\"/> Teams 12, 13 and 14 all had men from Team Able.  UDT 14 is called the first \"all fleet team\" even though Seabees from Team Able were attached and the Commander and XO were both CEC (Ltjg. A.B. Onderdonk and Ltjg. C.E. Emery).  UDT 15 was another team formed completely of NCDUs. Teams 12, 13, 14, and 15 were sent to Iwo Jima.  Teams 12, 13, and 14 would go back ashore on D-plus 2 to clear the waters edge for the next five days .   After July 1944 new UDTs were completely USN with no Army or USMC.

In April the Navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees. Even so, there were just two regular CBs that were \"[[colored]]\" units, the 34th<ref>Thirty Fourth Naval Construction Battalion, Cmdr Lester M.

Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers.  The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made the news.  The Commander of the 8oth had 19 enlisted discharged with dishonorable discharges for sedition.  The [[NAACP]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]] got 14 of those reversed.  In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored.  The proposal was approved, but it did not happen.\n\nThe lack of stevedores for unloading ships in combat zones was a huge issue to the Navy.  Authorization for the formation of cargo handling CBs or \"Special CBs\" happened mid-September 1942.<ref name=\"CBHistory\">This week in Seabee History, Sept 17\u201323, Seabee Online Magazine, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Washington Navy Yard, DC [http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dod live.mil/326-2/]</ref>  By wars end 41 Special CBs had been commissioned of which 15 were \"colored\".

Seabees landed at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]] during the assault, installing causeways dealing with enormous tides and enemy fire. Their actions there and elsewheres underscored the necessity of having CBs.  During that war the authorized size of a CB was 550 men. When the truce was declared there was no CB demobilization as there had been at the end of WWII.\n\nDuring the Korea, the U.S. realized the need of an air station in the region. [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point|Cubi Point]] in the Philippines was selected.   Civilian contractors were approached for bids. After seeing the [[Zambales Mountains]] and the maze of jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The Navy then turned to the Seabees. The first to arrive was CBD 1802 to do the surveying. [[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Three|MCB 3]] arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 all contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|long}} runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth-moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. Seabees there moved {{convert|20|e6cuyd|e6m3|abbr=off}} of dry fill plus another 15 million that was [[hydraulic fill]]. The $100&nbsp;million facility was commissioned on 25 July 1956, and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers.

Barges with a 2.5' [[Draft (hull)|draft]] are loaded and floated to and from a mother container ship, facilitating loading and unloading of containerized cargo at sea.

Loaded barges can then be moved toward the vessel's bow by means of a track to be stowed on one of three decks. Seabee barge carriers can store 38 barges, 12 each on the lower decks and 14 on the upper deck. The 38 barges can hold 160 containers.

The use of USMC organization allowed for smooth co-ordination, integration or interface between NCF and Marine Corps elements.  Additionally, CBs could be deployed individually or in multiples as the project scope and scale dictated. What distinguishes Seabees from [[Combat Engineers]] are the skill sets.

In the October 1944 issue of ''[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]]'' magazine, the Seabees are described as \"a phenomenon of World War II\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n29lcdffPWgC&pg=PA261|title=The Seabees |magazine=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |volume=35 |number=4 |date=October 1944 |page=261 |accessdate=18 October 2017 |quote=All in all, the Seabees look like a phenomenon of World War II and will probably die with it.}}</ref> The Seabees now have over 75 years of service without having changed from Adm. Moreell's model.\n\nSince creation Seabees have received all their advanced military training from the Marine Corps.  As  such, it is strictly standard conventional warfare.  Even so, Seabees always bring their toolbox.  One of those tools is the ingenuity Admiral King referenced.  They gained fame for their application of it during WWII.  The UDTs and flamethrowing tanks are declassified top secret examples. Post war they followed with more of the same for the CIA and State Department. Together with their USMC training and ability to appropriate anything, they provide the Navy an unconventional asset found nowhere else in the U.S military.\n\n== Naval construction history ==\n\n'''CB Conceptual Formation'''\n\nIn the early 1930s, the idea of the 1917 Twelfth Regiment was still remembered by the Navy's Civil Engineers.

In April the Navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees. Even so, there were just two regular CBs that were \"[[colored]]\" units, the 34th<ref>Thirty Fourth Naval Construction Battalion, Cmdr Lester M.

Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers.  The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made the news.  The Commander of the 8oth had 19 enlisted discharged with dishonorable discharges for sedition.  The [[NAACP]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]] got 14 of those reversed.  In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored.  The proposal was approved, but it did not happen.\n\nThe lack of stevedores for unloading ships in combat zones was a huge issue to the Navy.  Authorization for the formation of cargo handling CBs or \"Special CBs\" happened mid-September 1942.<ref name=\"CBHistory\">This week in Seabee History, Sept 17\u201323, Seabee Online Magazine, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Washington Navy Yard, DC [http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dod live.mil/326-2/]</ref>  By wars end 41 Special CBs had been commissioned of which 15 were \"colored\".

Seabees landed at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]] during the assault, installing causeways dealing with enormous tides and enemy fire. Their actions there and elsewheres underscored the necessity of having CBs.  During that war the authorized size of a CB was 550 men. When the truce was declared there was no CB demobilization as there had been at the end of WWII.\n\nDuring the Korea, the U.S. realized the need of an air station in the region. [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point|Cubi Point]] in the Philippines was selected.   Civilian contractors were approached for bids. After seeing the [[Zambales Mountains]] and the maze of jungle, they claimed it could not be done. The Navy then turned to the Seabees. The first to arrive was CBD 1802 to do the surveying. [[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Three|MCB 3]] arrived on 2 October 1951 to get the project going and was joined by MCB 5 in November. Over the next five years, MCBs 2, 7, 9, 11 and CBD 1803 all contributed to the effort. They leveled a mountain to make way for a nearly {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|long}} runway. NAS Cubi Point turned out to be one of the largest earth-moving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. Seabees there moved {{convert|20|e6cuyd|e6m3|abbr=off}} of dry fill plus another 15 million that was [[hydraulic fill]]. The $100&nbsp;million facility was commissioned on 25 July 1956, and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers. [[Adjusted-for-inflation]], today's price-tag for what the Seabees built at Cubi Point would be $906,871,323.53.\n\n'''Seabee Teams''' also called ''' Civic Action Teams or CAT<ref name=\"seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil\">{{Cite web|url=https://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/01/04/civic-action-team-building-friendships/|title=Civic Action Team: Building Friendships}}</ref><ref>\"Civil Engineers, Seabees & Bases in Vietnam\", Captain Charles J.

Jonah Barrington is most notable for his amusing and popular memoirs of life in late 18th-century Ireland; for his opposition to the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] in 1800; and for his removal from the judiciary by both Houses of Parliament in 1830, still a unique event.<ref>[http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/index.htm Ricorso]</ref>\n\n==Barrington family==\n[[File:Birthplace_doorway_in_Dublin.jpg|thumb|left|Barrington's former home, 14 [[Harcourt Street]], Dublin.

Galway]]. He was raised and schooled by his grandparents in Dublin and entered [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1773, aged 16 but he left Trinity College without a degree.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nHe joined the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] and supported the [[Irish Patriot Party|Irish Patriots]] in the early 1780s.<ref>[http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/jbarrington/jonah7.htm Memoirs, chapter 7]</ref> His father raised and commanded two Corps; the Cullenagh Rangers and the Ballyroan Light Infantry. Barrington's elder brother commanded both the Kilkenny Horse and the Durrow Light Dragoons. Barrington's father, through his correspondence with General [[Hunt Walsh]], then secured him a commission in Walsh's regiment. Upon learning that the regiment was to be sent to America to fight in the ongoing [[American Revolution|conflict]], and fearful of dying on some foreign battlefield, Barrington wrote to Walsh asking him to instead present the commission to another candidate, claiming that he himself was too tender to be of any real use. Barrington's fears proved well founded when his replacement, the only child of one of Walsh's friends, was killed in his first engagement.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barrington |first=John |title=Personal Sketches of His Own Times, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UXQ9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=jonah+barrington+volunteers+regiment#v=onepage&q=jonah%20barrington%20volunteers%20regiment&f=false |location=Ireland |publisher=Colburn and Bentley |pages=92\u201393 |isbn= |accessdate= |year=1830 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Law and Parliament===\n\nHe was [[Admission to practice law|called to the Irish bar]] in 1788 and in 1789 he married Catherine, daughter of Dublin mercer, Edward Grogan. They were to have seven children.<ref name=DNB/> The following year he entered by purchase of the seat the pre-1801 [[Parliament of Ireland]] as MP for [[Tuam]]. He accepted a [[sinecure]] post in 1793 at the Dublin customhouse worth \u00a31,000 p.a. generally supporting [[Henry Grattan]] and he [[Queen's Counsel|took silk]] the same year. Barrington was a member of the [[Kildare Street Club]] in Dublin.<ref>Thomas Hay Sweet Escott, ''Club Makers and Club Members'' (1913), [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028066979#page/n371/mode/2up pp. 329\u2013333]</ref> Appointed an [[Admiralty court]] judge in 1798 he re-entered parliament the same year as member for [[Clogher]] and voted against the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] in 1799\u20131800, rejecting [[John FitzGibbon, 1st Earl of Clare|Lord Clare]]'s offer of the solicitor-generalship in 1799. In 1802 he unsuccessfully contested a seat for [[Dublin]] in the [[UK parliament]].\n\n===Political legacy===\n\nBarrington's comments on the Act of Union had a continuing resonance with the [[Young Ireland]], [[Fenian]] and [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] movements, which hoped to re-establish \"[[Grattan's Parliament]]\" in some way. In particular his ''Rise and Fall of the Irish Nation'' (1833) provided the basis for this romantic idealisation of Grattan's Parliament adopted by the Irish Parliamentary Party from the 1880s.\n\n===Admiralty Court===\n\nAppointed an [[Admiralty court]] judge in 1798 at a salary of \u00a3500 he found there was little work to be done and his lack of a degree restricted other opportunities to support extravagant tastes. His award of a [[knighthood]] in 1807 brought no increased income. His court ordered the sale of two derelict vessels and he gave instructions that the proceeds were to go to his own bank account. In 1810 or 1811 he took his wife and family to England and from that time on his work in Ireland was carried out by surrogates. Still retaining his judgeship and salary he moved to France in 1814 to escape his creditors and never returned to Ireland.<ref name=DNB/>\n\n===Bankruptcy and loss of office===\n\nIn 1828 commissioners learnt of his financial irregularities. Barrington crossed the channel to London and protested that he was innocent but would not answer the charges based on the documentary evidence produced by the commissioners.<ref name=DNB/> In 1830 a parliamentary commission recommended that he be removed from office, finding misappropriations of court funds in 1805, 1806 and 1810. Pursuant to a provision<ref group=note>Judges' commissions are valid (during good behaviour) and if they do not behave themselves, they can be removed . . . This provision was the result of various monarchs influencing judges' decisions, and its purpose was to assure [[judicial independence]].</ref> of the [[Act of Settlement]] of 1701, which sought to protect the independence of the judiciary, both Houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom voted for an Address to [[King William IV]] praying for his removal, and the King duly dismissed Barringtom from office. By then, Barrington's first 1827 volume of memoirs had sold successfully, and they were republished and expanded (see below).\n\nBarrington was the first judge removed from office under the Act of Settlement, and to this day, is the only judge in the United Kingdom to be so removed.\n\n==Duel with Richard Daly==\n\nAccording to one of his sometimes spurious personal memoirs, on 20 March 1780. Barrington travelled to [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]] to [[duel]] with a [[Richard Daly]].\n\nDaly had fought 16 duels in three years - three with swords and thirteen with pistols. Remarkably, he, and his opponents, had always escaped serious injury. Barrington had no pistols so he and his second, [[Richard Crosbie]], had spent the previous night constructing a pair 'from old locks, stocks an barrels'.<ref name=\"duel\">J. Barrington (1918),[https://archive.org/details/recollectionsofj00barriala  \"Recollections of Jonah Barrington, Dublin\"], archive.org; accessed 20 March 2015.</ref> At Donnybrook, Daly's second, Jack Patterson, a nephew of the Chief Justice, approached Crosbie, explained that it was all a mistake and asked that the two shake hands. Barrington was in favour, but Crosbie would have none of it. Taking out a duelling handbook, he pointed to rule No.7 - 'No apology can be received after the parties meet, without a fire.'<ref name=\"duel\"/>\n\nTaking up their positions Barrington lost no time in pressing the trigger and Daly staggered back, put his hand to his chest, and cried \"I'm hit, Sir.\" The ball had not penetrated but had driven part of a brooch slightly into his breast-bone. Barrington only then thought to inquire why duel was even taking place. This time the rule book noted: \"If a party challenged accepts the challenge without asking the reason for it, the challenger is never bound to divulge it afterwards.\"<ref name=\"duel\"/>\n\n==Memoirs==\n\nBarrington is most notable today for his memoirs that included scathing but humorous thumbnail portraits of contemporary Irish lawyers, judges and politicians during the last years of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. ''Personal sketches'' also includes vignettes on Irish people from every background. His works were reprinted with frequent additions and renamings as:\n* ''Historic Anecdotes and Secret Memoirs of the Legislative Union between Great Britain and Ireland'' (London: G. Robinson 1809);\n:republished with a 2nd volume as: ''Historic Memoirs, Comprising Secret Records of the National Convention, the Rebellion, and the Union, with Delineations of the Principal Characters Connected with These Transactions'', 2 vols.

(Dublin: James Duffy 1853)\n\n==Criticism and literary resonance==\n\nSince his death Barrington's work has been quoted by a wide selection of editors, primarily following two themes; the political drama surrounding the Act of Union and the colourful nature of life in 1700s Ireland.\n\n* [[Frank O'Connor]], ed., ''Book of Ireland'' (London: Fontana 1959 & edns.), was impressed by: \"Merry Christmas, 1778\" ''uninterrupted match of hard-going till the weather should break up ... hogshead of superior claret\u2019 ... \u2018the pipers plied their chants ... I shall never forget the attraction this novelty had for my youthful mind'' (p.&nbsp;139); ''Sir [[Boyle Roche]] ... the most celebrated and entertaining anti-grammarian in the Irish Parliament'' (p.&nbsp;183); on duelling ''Ough, thunder! ... how many holes did the villain want drilled in to his carcass?'' (p.&nbsp;262); Crow Street theatre: ''immediately ... on being struck, he reeled, staggered, and fell very naturally, considering that it was his first death'' (p.&nbsp;278).\n* [[R. F.

Galway]]. He was raised and schooled by his grandparents in Dublin and entered [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1773, aged 16 but he left Trinity College without a degree.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nHe joined the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] and supported the [[Irish Patriot Party|Irish Patriots]] in the early 1780s.<ref>[http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/jbarrington/jonah7.htm Memoirs, chapter 7]</ref> His father raised and commanded two Corps; the Cullenagh Rangers and the Ballyroan Light Infantry. Barrington's elder brother commanded both the Kilkenny Horse and the Durrow Light Dragoons. Barrington's father, through his correspondence with General [[Hunt Walsh]], then secured him a commission in Walsh's regiment. Upon learning that the regiment was to be sent to America to fight in the ongoing [[American Revolution|conflict]], and fearful of dying on some foreign battlefield, Barrington wrote to Walsh asking him to instead present the commission to another candidate, claiming that he himself was too tender to be of any real use. Barrington's fears proved well founded when his replacement, the only child of one of Walsh's friends, was killed in his first engagement.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barrington |first=John |title=Personal Sketches of His Own Times, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UXQ9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=jonah+barrington+volunteers+regiment#v=onepage&q=jonah%20barrington%20volunteers%20regiment&f=false |location=Ireland |publisher=Colburn and Bentley |pages=92\u201393 |isbn= |accessdate= |year=1830 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Law and Parliament===\n\nHe was [[Admission to practice law|called to the Irish bar]] in 1788 and in 1789 he married Catherine, daughter of Dublin mercer, Edward Grogan. They were to have seven children.<ref name=DNB/> The following year he entered by purchase of the seat the pre-1801 [[Parliament of Ireland]] as MP for [[Tuam]]. He accepted a [[sinecure]] post in 1793 at the Dublin customhouse worth \u00a31,000 p.a. generally supporting [[Henry Grattan]] and he [[Queen's Counsel|took silk]] the same year. Barrington was a member of the [[Kildare Street Club]] in Dublin.<ref>Thomas Hay Sweet Escott, ''Club Makers and Club Members'' (1913), [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028066979#page/n371/mode/2up pp. 329\u2013333]</ref> Appointed an [[Admiralty court]] judge in 1798 he re-entered parliament the same year as member for [[Clogher]] and voted against the [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] in 1799\u20131800, rejecting [[John FitzGibbon, 1st Earl of Clare|Lord Clare]]'s offer of the solicitor-generalship in 1799. In 1802 he unsuccessfully contested a seat for [[Dublin]] in the [[UK parliament]].\n\n===Political legacy===\n\nBarrington's comments on the Act of Union had a continuing resonance with the [[Young Ireland]], [[Fenian]] and [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] movements, which hoped to re-establish \"[[Grattan's Parliament]]\" in some way. In particular his ''Rise and Fall of the Irish Nation'' (1833) provided the basis for this romantic idealisation of Grattan's Parliament adopted by the Irish Parliamentary Party from the 1880s.\n\n===Admiralty Court===\n\nAppointed an [[Admiralty court]] judge in 1798 at a salary of \u00a3500 he found there was little work to be done and his lack of a degree restricted other opportunities to support extravagant tastes. His award of a [[knighthood]] in 1807 brought no increased income. His court ordered the sale of two derelict vessels and he gave instructions that the proceeds were to go to his own bank account. In 1810 or 1811 he took his wife and family to England and from that time on his work in Ireland was carried out by surrogates. Still retaining his judgeship and salary he moved to France in 1814 to escape his creditors and never returned to Ireland.<ref name=DNB/>\n\n===Bankruptcy and loss of office===\n\nIn 1828 commissioners learnt of his financial irregularities. Barrington crossed the channel to London and protested that he was innocent but would not answer the charges based on the documentary evidence produced by the commissioners.<ref name=DNB/> In 1830 a parliamentary commission recommended that he be removed from office, finding misappropriations of court funds in 1805, 1806 and 1810. Pursuant to a provision<ref group=note>Judges' commissions are valid (during good behaviour) and if they do not behave themselves, they can be removed . . . This provision was the result of various monarchs influencing judges' decisions, and its purpose was to assure [[judicial independence]].</ref> of the [[Act of Settlement]] of 1701, which sought to protect the independence of the judiciary, both Houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom voted for an Address to [[King William IV]] praying for his removal, and the King duly dismissed Barringtom from office. By then, Barrington's first 1827 volume of memoirs had sold successfully, and they were republished and expanded (see below).\n\nBarrington was the first judge removed from office under the Act of Settlement, and to this day, is the only judge in the United Kingdom to be so removed.\n\n==Duel with Richard Daly==\n\nAccording to one of his sometimes spurious personal memoirs, on 20 March 1780. Barrington travelled to [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]] to [[duel]] with a [[Richard Daly]].\n\nDaly had fought 16 duels in three years - three with swords and thirteen with pistols. Remarkably, he, and his opponents, had always escaped serious injury. Barrington had no pistols so he and his second, [[Richard Crosbie]], had spent the previous night constructing a pair 'from old locks, stocks an barrels'.<ref name=\"duel\">J. Barrington (1918),[https://archive.org/details/recollectionsofj00barriala  \"Recollections of Jonah Barrington, Dublin\"], archive.org; accessed 20 March 2015.</ref> At Donnybrook, Daly's second, Jack Patterson, a nephew of the Chief Justice, approached Crosbie, explained that it was all a mistake and asked that the two shake hands. Barrington was in favour, but Crosbie would have none of it. Taking out a duelling handbook, he pointed to rule No.7 - 'No apology can be received after the parties meet, without a fire.'<ref name=\"duel\"/>\n\nTaking up their positions Barrington lost no time in pressing the trigger and Daly staggered back, put his hand to his chest, and cried \"I'm hit, Sir.\" The ball had not penetrated but had driven part of a brooch slightly into his breast-bone. Barrington only then thought to inquire why duel was even taking place. This time the rule book noted: \"If a party challenged accepts the challenge without asking the reason for it, the challenger is never bound to divulge it afterwards.\"<ref name=\"duel\"/>\n\n==Memoirs==\n\nBarrington is most notable today for his memoirs that included scathing but humorous thumbnail portraits of contemporary Irish lawyers, judges and politicians during the last years of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. ''Personal sketches'' also includes vignettes on Irish people from every background. His works were reprinted with frequent additions and renamings as:\n* ''Historic Anecdotes and Secret Memoirs of the Legislative Union between Great Britain and Ireland'' (London: G. Robinson 1809);\n:republished with a 2nd volume as: ''Historic Memoirs, Comprising Secret Records of the National Convention, the Rebellion, and the Union, with Delineations of the Principal Characters Connected with These Transactions'', 2 vols.

(Dublin: James Duffy 1853)\n\n==Criticism and literary resonance==\n\nSince his death Barrington's work has been quoted by a wide selection of editors, primarily following two themes; the political drama surrounding the Act of Union and the colourful nature of life in 1700s Ireland.\n\n* [[Frank O'Connor]], ed., ''Book of Ireland'' (London: Fontana 1959 & edns.), was impressed by: \"Merry Christmas, 1778\" ''uninterrupted match of hard-going till the weather should break up ... hogshead of superior claret\u2019 ... \u2018the pipers plied their chants ... I shall never forget the attraction this novelty had for my youthful mind'' (p.&nbsp;139); ''Sir [[Boyle Roche]] ... the most celebrated and entertaining anti-grammarian in the Irish Parliament'' (p.&nbsp;183); on duelling ''Ough, thunder! ... how many holes did the villain want drilled in to his carcass?'' (p.&nbsp;262); Crow Street theatre: ''immediately ... on being struck, he reeled, staggered, and fell very naturally, considering that it was his first death'' (p.&nbsp;278).\n* [[R. F.
