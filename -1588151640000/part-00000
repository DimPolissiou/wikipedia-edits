It is closely related to the [[Puli dog|Puli]] and [[Pumi (dog)|Pumi]], from which it was separated in the 1930s. Today, the Mudi is bred for work, sport, companionship, and [[conformation show|show]].  They continue to be used in herding, as well as participating in a variety of [[dog sports]]. They are often said to be the \"barkiest dog breed\" and are not recommended for the typical dog owner.\n\n==History== \nThe Mudi was first discovered as a breed in 1936 by Dr. Dezso Fenyes in Hungary, where it became known as the \"driver dog.\" Mudis nearly disappeared shortly after their recognition, as many were killed during World War II. The breed became recognized by The Federation Cynologique Internationale in 1966, followed by the United Kennel Club in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/mudi#history|title=Mudi Breed Information|website=Vetstreet.com|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>   In the American Kennel Club, Mudi are in the Miscellaneous Class.<ref>{{cite web |title=Miscellaneous Class |url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/miscellaneous-class/}}</ref> The Mudi still actively herds in Hungary with Hungarian shepherds and with flocks of up to 500 sheep. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/mudi/detail/|title=Mudi History & Training/Temperament|website=Akc.org|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n=== Appearance ===\n[[Image:Mudi fawn.JPG|thumb|left|A fawn Mudi]]\nMudi usually weigh {{convert|18|to|29|lb|kg}} and stand {{convert|15|to|19|in|cm}} high at the [[withers]].

They are great for alerting and protecting their home and family. They have a high pitched bark and are often very loud.There are three herding dogs native to Hungary: the Puli, Pumi and Mudi, all having similar characteristics. The Mudi is a clever, keen, active dog who becomes very attached to its owner and family. They are often aloof with strangers and early socialization is recommended. The Mudi is often talked about as being \"the barkiest breed\".\nThe Mudi is not recommended for the typical dog owner due to not only its high energy but also that many in the breed have temperament issues and struggle with fearfulness and reactivity.\n\n=== Exercise and activities ===\nThe Mudi is a very active breed. They need to be taken on a daily, long, brisk walks or jogs. In addition, they will benefit from a large safe area where they can run free. They need a lot of running and other exercises to be in good condition. They love to play and will excel in all kinds of dog sports such as Frisbee. The Mudi can compete in [[dog agility]] trials, [[obedience training|obedience]], [[Rally obedience]], [[Schutzhund]], [[Dog showmanship|showmanship]], [[flyball]], [[tracking (dog)|tracking]], and [[herding]] events.

Grundri\u00df der verstehenden Soziologie'''}}; or simply '''''Economy and Society''''') is a book by [[political economist]] and [[sociologist]] [[Max Weber]], published posthumously in Germany by his wife [[Marianne Weber|Marianne]]. Alongside ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905), it is considered to be one of Weber's most important works. Extremely broad in scope, the book covers numerous themes including [[religion]], [[economics]], [[politics]], [[public administration]], and [[sociology]]. A complete translation of the work was not published in English until 1968.\n\nIn 1998, the [[International Sociological Association]] listed this work as the most important sociological book of the 20th century.<ref name=\"isa-sociology\">{{cite web|url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/books/books10.htm|title=ISA - International Sociological Association: Books of the Century|publisher=International Sociological Association|year=1998|accessdate=2012-07-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010230113/http://www.isa-sociology.org/books/books10.htm|archivedate=2012-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Quotes==\n\n===Sociology===\n<blockquote>Sociology\u2026is a science concerning itself with the interpretive understanding of [[social action]] and thereby with a causal explanation of its course  and consequences. We shall speak of \"action\" insofar as the acting individual attaches a subjective meaning to his behavior.<ref name=\":0\">Weber, Max. 1968 [1921]. \"Basic Sociological Terms.\" In ''Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology''. New York: Bedminster Press. p. 4.</ref>{{Rp|4}}</blockquote>\n\n===Ideal types (pure types)===\n<blockquote>For the purposes of a typological scientific analysis it is convenient to treat all irrational, affectually determined elements of behavior as factors of deviation from a conceptually [[pure type]] of rational action. For example a panic on the stock exchange can be most conveniently analysed by attempting to determine first what the course of action would have been if it had not been influenced by irrational affects; it is then possible to introduce the irrational components as accounting for the observed deviations from this hypothetical course...Only in this way is it possible to assess the causal significance of irrational factors as accounting for the deviation of this type. The construction of a purely rational course of action in such cases serves the sociologist as a type ([[ideal type]]) which has the merit of clear understandability and lack of ambiguity. By comparison with this it is possible to understand the ways in which actual action is influenced by irrational factors of all sorts, such as affects and errors, in that they account for the deviation from the line of conduct which would be expected on hypothesis that the action were purely rational.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|6}}</blockquote>\n\n==Concepts==\n\n===Orientations of social action===\n[[Social action]], like all action, may be oriented in four ways:<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|24-5}}\n\n# '''Instrumentally rational''' ({{Lang-de|zweckrational|label=none}}): action \"determined by expectations as to the behavior of objects in the environment and of other human beings; these expectations are used as \"conditions\" or \"means\" for the attainment of the actor's own rationally pursued and calculated ends.\"\n# '''Value-rational''' ({{Lang-de|wertrational|label=none}}): action \"determined by a conscious belief in the value for its own sake of some ethical, aesthetic, religious, or other form of behavior, independently of its prospects of success.\"\n# '''Affectual''' (especially emotional): action \"determined by the actor's specific affects and feeling states.\"\n# '''Traditional''': action \"determined by ingrained habituation.\"\n\n===Religion===\n\nIn part 2, chapter VI, Weber distinguishes three [[ideal type]]s of religious activity:<ref>Zaleski, Pawel. 2010. \"Ideal Types in Max Weber's Sociology of Religion: Some Theoretical Inspirations for a Study of the Religious Field.\" ''[[Polish Sociological Review]]'' 3(171).</ref>\n\n# World-flying [[mysticism]];<ref name=\"weber_asceticism\" />{{Rp|544-5}} \n# World-rejecting [[asceticism]];<ref name=\"weber_asceticism\">Weber, Max. 1968 [1912]. \"Asceticism, Mysticism and Salvation.\" In ''Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology''.

Alongside ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905), it is considered to be one of Weber's most important works. Extremely broad in scope, the book covers numerous themes including [[religion]], [[economics]], [[politics]], [[public administration]], and [[sociology]]. A complete translation of the work was not published in English until 1968.\n\nIn 1998, the [[International Sociological Association]] listed this work as the most important sociological book of the 20th century.<ref name=\"isa-sociology\">{{cite web|url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/books/books10.htm|title=ISA - International Sociological Association: Books of the Century|publisher=International Sociological Association|year=1998|accessdate=2012-07-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010230113/http://www.isa-sociology.org/books/books10.htm|archivedate=2012-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Quotes==\n\n===Sociology===\n<blockquote>Sociology\u2026is a science concerning itself with the interpretive understanding of [[social action]] and thereby with a causal explanation of its course  and consequences.

The construction of a purely rational course of action in such cases serves the sociologist as a type ([[ideal type]]) which has the merit of clear understandability and lack of ambiguity. By comparison with this it is possible to understand the ways in which actual action is influenced by irrational factors of all sorts, such as affects and errors, in that they account for the deviation from the line of conduct which would be expected on hypothesis that the action were purely rational.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|6}}</blockquote>\n\n==Concepts=====Orientations of social action===\n[[Social action]], like all action, may be oriented in four ways:<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|24-5}}\n\n# '''Instrumentally rational''' ({{Lang-de|zweckrational|label=none}}): action \"determined by expectations as to the behavior of objects in the environment and of other human beings; these expectations are used as \"conditions\" or \"means\" for the attainment of the actor's own rationally pursued and calculated ends.\"\n# '''Value-rational''' ({{Lang-de|wertrational|label=none}}): action \"determined by a conscious belief in the value for its own sake of some ethical, aesthetic, religious, or other form of behavior, independently of its prospects of success.\"\n# '''Affectual''' (especially emotional): action \"determined by the actor's specific affects and feeling states.\"\n# '''Traditional''': action \"determined by ingrained habituation.\"\n\n===Religion===\n\nIn part 2, chapter VI, Weber distinguishes three [[ideal type]]s of religious activity:<ref>Zaleski, Pawel. 2010. \"Ideal Types in Max Weber's Sociology of Religion: Some Theoretical Inspirations for a Study of the Religious Field.\" ''[[Polish Sociological Review]]'' 3(171).</ref>\n\n# World-flying [[mysticism]];<ref name=\"weber_asceticism\" />{{Rp|544-5}} \n# World-rejecting [[asceticism]];<ref name=\"weber_asceticism\">Weber, Max. 1968 [1912]. \"Asceticism, Mysticism and Salvation.\" In ''Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology''.

Full dress uniforms typically include full-size [[order (distinction)|orders]] and [[medal]]s [[insignia]]. Styles tend to trace back to uniforms used during the 19th century, although the 20th century saw the adoption of [[mess dress uniform|mess-dress]] styled full-dress uniforms. Designs may depend on [[regiment]] or [[service branch]] (e.g. [[army]], [[navy]], [[air force]], [[marines]]). In [[Western dress codes]], full dress uniform is a permitted supplementary alternative equivalent to the [[civilian]] [[white tie]] for evening wear or [[morning dress]] for day wear \u2013 sometimes collectively called ''[[full dress]]'' \u2013 although military uniforms are the same for day and evening wear. As such, full dress uniform is the most formal uniform, followed by the [[mess dress uniform]].\n\nAlthough full dress uniforms are often brightly coloured and ornamented with gold [[epaulettes]], [[braid]]s, [[lanyard]]s, [[lampasse]]s, etc., most originated as practical uniforms that, with the adoption of even more practical uniforms, were relegated to ceremonial functions. Before [[World War I]], most armed forces of the world retained uniforms of this type that were usually more colourful and elaborate than the ordinary duty (known as ''[[undress]]''), or the active [[service dress uniform]].<ref>{{cite book|first=W.Y.|last=Carman|page=61|title=A Dictionary of Military Uniforms|isbn=0-684-15130-8|year=1977}}</ref>\n\nWhile full dress uniform is predominantly worn at occasions by [[commissioned officer]]s and [[non-commissioned officer]]s, it may also be worn as an optional uniform by some senior [[enlisted personnel]]. It is also sometimes worn by members of [[royal court]]s, [[order of chivalry|orders of chivalry]] or certain civilian uniformed services, although some of these may border to [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom|court uniforms]].\n\n{{toc limit|4}}\n\n==Name==\n\"Full dress uniform\" is often applied in order to distinguish from [[semi-formal]] [[mess dress uniform]]s, as well as [[informal wear|informal]] [[service dress uniform]]s.\n\nYet, full dress uniform is sometimes called ''dress uniform''. Although many services use the term ''dress'' generically for uniforms, allowing it to refer to more modern service dress (\"combat\") uniforms with suitable modifiers (e.g. the [[British Army]]'s obsolete [[Battle Dress]]; and the [[U.S. Army]]'s obsolete [[Battle Dress Uniform]]). Therefore, the term ''dress uniform'' without prefix typically refers to full dress uniform as described in this article.\n\n==History==\nThe [[British Army|British]] and [[United States Army|United States armies]] were dependent upon voluntary [[military recruitment|recruiting]] and found that a smart dress served to attract recruits and improve morale amongst those already serving. The British [[regiment|regimental system]] fostered numerous distinctions amongst different units.\n\nHowever, this was not limited to volunteer armies, with [[conscription|conscript]] armies of continental Europe retaining many of the colourful features that had evolved during the nineteenth century, for reasons of national and unit pride. Thus, in 1913 most French soldiers wore red [[trouser]]s and [[kepi]]s as part of their full dress,<ref>{{cite book|first=Andre|last=Jouineau|pages=7\u201359|title=French Army in 1914|isbn=978-2-35250-104-6|year=2008}}</ref> the majority of British foot regiments retained the [[Red coat (military uniform)|scarlet tunic]]s for [[parade]] and off duty (\"walking out\"),<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Harrington|pages=10\u2013146|title=British Army Uniforms in Color|isbn=0-7643-1302-9|year=2001}}</ref> the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] was characterised by [[Prussian blue]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl|last=Becker|pages=11\u201314|title=The Kaiser's Army in Color|isbn=0-7643-1173-5|year=2000}}</ref> the Russian by dark green,<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert W.|last=Kennedy|pages=8\u201327|title=Uniforms of Imperial & Soviet Russia|isbn=0-7643-1320-7|year=2001}}</ref> and the Austro-Hungary Army by a wide range of differing [[Facing (sewing)|facing colours]] dating back to the 18th century.<ref>James Lucas, \"Fighting Troops of the Austro-Hungarian Army 1868-1914, {{ISBN|0-87052-362-7}}</ref>\n\nThere were usually exceptions to each of these rules, often distinguishing unique units. This included the German [[cuirassier]]s, who wore white full dress; British [[rifle regiment]]s, who wore [[rifle green]]; and French mountain troops who wore large [[beret]]s and light blue trousers. The U.S. Army with its \"dress blues\" was an exception, with [[cavalry]], [[artillery]] and [[infantry]] being distinguished only by the different branch colours.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition, Volume XXVII, pages 592\u2013593</ref>\n\nAfter World War I most full dress uniforms disappeared. Many of the regimes that had taken a particular pride in the retention of colourful traditional uniforms had been overthrown and their [[republic]]an, [[fascism|fascist]], or [[communism|communist]] successors had little incentive to retain old glories. Elsewhere cost and disillusion with the \"peacock\" aspects of old fashioned soldiering had a similar effect, except for ceremonial guard units and such limited exceptions as [[Officer (military)|officers]]' evening or off-duty uniforms.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Mollo|page=231|title=Military Fashion|isbn=0-214-65349-8}}</ref>\n\nModern armies are characterised by simple and drably coloured dress even for ceremonial occasion, with the exceptions noted above. However a general trend towards replacing conscript armies with long serving professionals has had, as a side effect, a reversion to dress uniforms that combine smartness with some traditional features. Thus the U.S. Army announced in 2006 that uniforms of modern cut but in the traditional dark and light blue colours will become universal issue, replacing the previous grey/green service dress. The French Army has, with the abolition of conscription, reintroduced kepis, fringed [[epaulettes]] and sashes in traditional colours to wear with [[camouflage]] \"trellis\" or light beige parade dress.<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Galliac|pages=89\u201390|title=L' Armee Francaise|isbn=978-2-35250-195-4|year=2012}}</ref> The British Army with its strong regimental traditions has retained a wide range of special features and dress items to distinguish individual units, in spite of recent amalgamations.<ref>Section 01.200, ''Army Dress Regulations (All Ranks)'', Ministry of Defence, January 2011</ref>  Although there still exist official patterns for full dress uniforms for each regiment or corps within the British Army, this uniform is seldom issued at public expense, except for units which are often on [[public duties]], such as the [[Guards Division]], Regimental Bands and [[Corps of Drums]], which are bought from the Regiment's allowance.<ref name=\"jsp336-3-12-1\">{{cite book|title = Joint Service Publication 336: The Defence Supply Chain Manual|edition = 3rd|url = http://www.aof.mod.uk/content/docs/jsp336/3rd_ed/vol12/pt3/pam12/s1.doc|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071106000709/http://www.aof.mod.uk/content/docs/jsp336/3rd_ed/vol12/pt3/pam12/s1.doc|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2007-11-06|accessdate = |author = British Army Dress Committee|date = August 2005|volume = Vol. 12''', Part 3, Pamphlet 12, Sect. 1 '''|page = Para. 117, 119}}</ref>\n\n==Full dress uniform by country==\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Banda Militar del Regimiento de Infanter\u00eda de Patricios 2016 001.jpg|thumb|The [[Regiment of Patricians]] is one of several units in the [[Argentine Army]] whose full dress uniform dates back to the 19th century.]] \nIn the [[Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic]], the [[Argentine Federal Police]], Argentine National Gendarmrie and Naval Prefecture, dress uniforms are worn during military and civil occasions, especially for the [[military band]]s and [[colour guard]]s.

This may include amplification where the regulations are unclear or are not mandatory; amendments or reversal of some existing regulations for special occasions or events; or the promulgation of regulations regarding the wear of traditional regimental articles (such as kilts).\n\n=====Royal Military College of Canada=====\n[[File:Royal Military College of Canada band piper and bugler, Remembrance Day.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Military College of Canada Bands|Band]] members of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in full dress.]]\nThe full dress uniform for [[officer cadet]] of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] is similar to the universal full dress uniform of the Canadian Army, with minor variation.<ref name=canuni/> The full dress uniform used by the Royal Military College has remained essentially the same since the institution's founding in 1876, although the [[pillbox hat]] has replaced the [[shako]]. The [[pith helmet]] remains in use for ceremonial parade positions only.\n\n====Non-military organisations====\n=====Canadian Cadet Organisations=====\nThe [[Canadian Cadet Organizations|youth cadet programs]] in Canada, the [[Royal Canadian Army Cadets]], [[Royal Canadian Sea Cadets]] and the [[Royal Canadian Air Cadets]] each maintain their own dress uniforms. Youth-based Canadian cadet organisations are sponsored by the Canadian Armed Forces, with uniforms provided free of charge and funded by the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]]. Full dress uniforms worn by cadets are modeled after the organisation's sponsoring service branch.\n\n=====Royal Canadian Mounted Police=====\nThe modern dress uniform of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] is closely based on the everyday uniforms used by the predecessor [[North West Mounted Police]] in the late nineteenth century.  It features the [[Red Serge]], a scarlet British-style military pattern tunic, complete with a high-neck collar and dark blue [[breeches]] with yellow stripes derived from British and Canadian cavalry uniforms of the same era, and usually a [[campaign hat]] (or \"[[stetson]]\") and brown [[riding boots]].\n\n=== Chile ===\n==== Chilean Air Force ====\nThe full dress uniform of the [[Chilean Air Force]] since 2001 has been a medium-blue tunic and trousers, worn with a peaked visor cap. For parade dress, officers additionally wear a sword belt.\n\n==== Chilean Army ====\n[[File:Caballeria del Ej\u00e9rcito en Izamiento gran Bandera Nacional.jpg|left|thumb|Though full dress uniform in the [[Chilean Army]] typically is ''[[feldgrau]]'', some units wear more colorful uniforms; here, a ceremonial cavalry unit wears a dress uniform based on an early twentieth-century uniform of German [[dragoons]].]]\nThe usual full dress uniform of the [[Chilean Army]] is based on twentieth-century German ''[[feldgrau]]'' uniforms; however, several units wear more colorful full dress uniforms. Cadets of the military academy \"Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme\" wear a [[Prussian blue]] uniform with ''[[Pickelhaube]]'', based on the uniform worn by the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelmine]] [[Guards Corps (German Empire)|foot guard regiments]]. Some military units, including the Chacabuco and Rancagua regiments, wear a uniform from the War of the Pacific during parades, with [[kepi]]s as headdress. The Buin regiment (2nd Army division in the Santiago Metropolitan region) has reintroduced the infantry regimental uniform of the [[Chilean War of Independence]], having been formed in December 1810 as the 1st Infantry Regiment \"Chilean Grenadiers\", the original unit of the Chilean Army. The 1st Cavalry Regiment and the Krupp Artillery Battery of the 1st Artillery Regiment, both ceremonial units of the Army, have since 2012 worn the early twentieth-century Prussian-style full dress uniforms of the Army's cavalry and artillery branches.\n\n==== Chilean Navy ====\nThe [[Chilean Navy|Chilean naval]] officer's dress uniform is navy-blue with visored hat, sword strap (for petty officers and cadets, only during parades and ceremonies), navy-blue trousers, and black boots. The enlisted uniform (for sailors and petty officers) evinces a mix of Prussian and British influences, having a sailor cap with the dress while the Marine enlisted and NCO uniform is a dark-blue polo with trousers and a belt plus a peaked cap.\n\nThe dress uniform of the naval academy \"Arturo Prat\" is also blue with trousers, but with headdress similar to that worn by Prat and the crew of the ''Esmeralda'' during the [[Battle of Iquique]] in 1879.\n\n===France===\nAs with many European countries, the French military used in the 19th and early 20th c. many traditional and heavily decorated dress uniforms. Since [[World War II]], they are not in common use and usually restricted to special units in the [[French Army]] and [[National Gendarmerie]].\n\n====French Army====\n[[File:21e RIMa Bastille Day 2008.jpg|thumb|Several units, such as the [[Troupes de Marine]], are permitted to wear more decorated variants of their [[Service dress uniform|service dress]] as their full dress uniform.]]\nIn the Army, only bands and schools have a dress uniform.

Founded as a [[military academy]], the institution was transformed into a state-sponsored civilian [[post-secondary education|post-secondary school]] in 1970, although still operated by the French [[Ministry of Defence (France)|Ministry of Defence]].\n\n====National Gendarmerie====\n[[File:Republican Guard Bastille Day 2013 Paris t110458.jpg|thumb|French [[Republican Guard (France)|Republican Guard]] infantry in full dress uniform.]]\nThe [[Republican Guard (France)|Republican Guard]] of the National Gendarmerie is the last unit to wear dress uniform as service uniform, as [[guard of honour]] detachments are required to wear it while on duty. The cavalry regiment wear a 19th-century [[dragoon]] uniform, with metal helmet and white riding trousers, while the infantry regiments use a high-collared traditional gendarmerie uniform. The officer cadets and the staff of [[\u00e9cole des officiers de la gendarmerie nationale]] also use uniforms whose styling dates back to the 19th century.\n\n===Indonesia===\n[[File:Gatot Nurmantyo.jpg|thumb|upright|Former [[Indonesian Army]] general [[Gatot Nurmantyo]] dressed in PDU I, the [[Indonesian Army]]'s equivalent to full dress uniform]]\nThe [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]], [[Indonesian National Police]], and other uniformed institutions of the country have their own types of Dress uniforms known as \"PDU\", an abbreviation from ''Pakaian Dinas Upacara'' literally meaning \"ceremonial uniform\" in [[Bahasa Indonesia|Indonesian]]; worn during formal occasions and when attending ceremonies. The Dress uniform (PDU) of the National Armed Forces consists of several categories which are:\n{{col div}}\n*PDU I - ([[Service medal]]s and [[Brevet (military)|brevets]] attached)  \n*PDU IA - ([[Orders, decorations, and medals of Indonesia#Star decorations|Order decorations]] attached and [[Sash#Honorific orders|honorary sash]] worn over for those who are entitled to wear it)\n*PDU II - ([[Mess dress uniform#Indonesia|Mess dress uniform]])\n*PDU IIA - (Mess dress uniform with order decorations attached)  \n*PDU III - ([[Service ribbons]] attached)\n*PDU IV - (Short sleeved, with no [[necktie]] worn).<ref>Indonesian National Armed Forces Commander decree, dated 16 Mei 2019, regarding the Uniform, Attributes, Medals, and Rank Insignia of the Indonesian Armed Forces</ref>\n{{col div end}}\nEach uniform category is worn for different purposes and for certain occasions. The \"PDU I\" and \"PDU IA\" are regarded as \"full dress uniforms\" which are worn for formal state occasions and when attending ceremonial events of high significance. The headdress worn for this uniform is a peaked cap for men and a crusher cap for women, and for officers from special forces, as well as the Military Police, may wear their respective berets. When wearing the Mess dress uniform, no headdress is worn.\n\nThe \"PDU III\" uniform is worn during receptions and/or during the welcoming ceremony of a visiting high ranking foreign guest ([[head of state]] or head of government). While the \"PDU IV\" uniform is worn for occasions such as: [[Change of Command]] ceremonies, attending a [[passing out parade]], and worn by [[Military justice|military judges]] in the court.<ref>[https://dokumen.tips/documents/penggunaan-kelengkapan-dan-atribut-tni-ad.html Usage, Attributes, and Uniform of the Indonesian Army ]</ref> The mess dress uniform is basically the same for the three branches of the armed forces. For male [[Indonesian Navy]] officers wearing the full dress uniform (\"PDUs\" I and IA), will always carry his dress [[sabre]] wherever he goes, female personnel and officers in the other hand would carry her issued dress uniform [[Handbag|purse]] except for those in command posts which are also entitled to sabres.\n\n===Israel===\nEach arm of the [[Israeli Defence Force]] (IDF) [[GOC Army Headquarters|ground forces]], [[Israeli Navy|Navy]] and [[Israeli Air Force|Air Force]] has its own dress uniform, with separate versions for summer and winter. These are similar in style to civilian business dress suits, or to the service dress uniforms worn by the British forces. The dress uniform includes a [[Blazer|blazer-type]] jacket, worn with a white shirt, and a tie. The ground forces uniform is dark green, with a single-breasted, three-buttoned jacket and tie of the same colour. Headgear worn is the beret. The air force uniform is of the same design, but medium blue. The naval uniform has a darker blue, double-breasted, six-buttoned jacket, with gold-coloured rank insignia on the cuffs.<ref>[http://www.timesofisrael.com/generals-get-a-makeover-with-new-dress-uniforms/ '' Dressed to kill: Generals get a makeover with new dress uniforms'', by Judah Ari Gross.

Prior to 2016, the dress uniform, the ''Madei Srad'' was only worn abroad, either by a [[military attach\u00e9]] or by senior officers on official [[state visit]]s.\n\n=== Russia ===\n{{Further|Uniforms of the Russian Armed Forces}}\nThe uniforms of the [[Russian Armed Forces]] were inherited from the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and modified throughout the years. Some features of modern full dress uniform worn by both army and navy personnel date from those of the final Czarist period, prior to 1917. Most notably these include the blue-green shade of the modern army officer's parade and walking out uniform; the dark blue and white dress uniform still worn by sailors; and the ceremonial dress of the Kremlin Regiment.\n\n=== Sweden===\n{{Further|Swedish Military Uniform}}\n{{see also|Mess dress uniform#Full mess dress}}\n[[File:Swedish Royal Guard Bastille Day 2007.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Officer of the Life Company of the Swedish Lifeguards (2007)]]\nVarious forms of full dress uniforms were used by all regiments of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] for ceremonial purposes until the 1960s, when they were generally discontinued, with the exception of the [[Svea Life Guards]] and the [[Life Guard Dragoons (Sweden)|Life Guard Dragoons]] still retaining colourful full dress uniforms of 19th century origin for ceremonial use. The remaining parts of the branches tend to apply a variant of the [[mess dress uniform]] called \"full mess uniform\" for formal wear purposes. White [[Spats (footwear)|spats]] and belts may also be added to their service dress uniforms for parades or certain ceremonial purposes.\n\n==== Swedish Army ====\nThere are three versions of full dress uniforms in use in the [[Swedish Army]] as of the present day, all belonging to the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]]. The infantry wears the dark blue uniform of the Svea Life Guards (1st Life Guards) with yellow collar, cuffs and piping which dates back to 1886. The [[Royal Swedish Army Band|Swedish Army Band]] wears the uniform of G\u00f6ta Life Guards (2nd Life Guards), with red collar, cuffs and piping. The headdress of the infantry is mainly the pickelhaube typed helmet in black leather from 1887. On state ceremonies, a white buffalo hair plume is added. [[Bearskin hat]]s dating from 1823 are still in use on special occasions.\n\nThe cavalry, including the [[Life Guards' Dragoon Music Corps|Swedish Cavalry Band]], wear the [[royal blue]] uniform of the Life Guard Dragoons (1st Cavalry) from 1895. Officers have a somewhat lighter colour on their full dress uniform compared to the troopers. The pickelhaube type helmet is made of nickel-plated steel with [[brass]] details and dates back to 1879. Changes were made in 1900 which transformed the helmet into a cuirassier style helmet. In 1928 with the amalgamation of the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Regiments, a helm wreath was added, together with a golden laurel wreath. Officers' gold chin straps with lion \"mascarons\" from the [[Life Regiment Dragoons]] (2nd Cavalry) were also authorised for the new composite regiment. On modern state occasions officers wear white buffalo hair plume while troopers wear a horse hair plumes of the same colour.\n\n==== Swedish Navy ====\n[[File:Royal Wedding Stockholm 2010 0c176 2128.jpg|thumb|Two officers in full dress on the royal barge ''Vasaorden''. In the [[Swedish Navy]], full dress is restricted to naval officers serving on the ''Vasaorden'']]\nIn the [[Swedish Navy]], only one ceremonial uniform is still in use. It is restricted to naval officers serving on the royal barge \"Vasaorden\" (Order of Vasa); a ship used only on rare ceremonial occasions. The uniform dates back to 1878.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n==== British Army ====\n{{Main|Uniforms of the British Army}}\nMost of the various uniforms worn by the [[British Army Uniforms|British Army]] today originate in former combat uniforms. At the start of the 19th century, British Army [[Regiment of Foot|Regiments of Foot]], trained to fight in the manner dictated by a weapon (the [[musket]]) which demanded close proximity to the target, were not concerned with camouflage, and wore red coats (scarlet for officers and sergeants). Rifle regiments, fighting as [[skirmishers]], and equipped with [[rifle]]s, were more concerned with concealment however, and wore dark green uniforms. [[Light Infantry]] regiments were also trained as skirmishers but wore red uniforms with green shakos. Whereas the infantry generally wore polished brass [[button]]s and white carrying equipment, the Rifles wore black.\n[[File:British old infantry uniforms.jpg|thumb|Infantry uniforms of the [[British Army]], from 1750\u20131835. Full dress uniforms in the British Army originate from former combat uniforms.]]\nHeavy [[dragoon]]s and [[Royal Engineers]] wore red (or later scarlet) coats. Most of the remainder of the British Army, however, including the [[Royal Regiment of Artillery]], [[hussar]]s, all but one [[lancer]] regiment, and various support elements wore dark blue uniforms{{cn|date=February 2020}}. These varied greatly in detail according to the arm of service or in many cases the individual regiment. [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Reserve]] units were for the most part distinguished by having silver (rather than gold-coloured) lace, buttons and accoutrements in full dress. From the [[Crimean War]] on, a narrow red stripe (piping) down the outside of each trouser leg was common to all red coated infantry units. Cavalry however wore stripes of regimental colour (white, yellow, blue/grey etc.) on their riding breeches. Scottish [[:Category:Highland regiments|Highland regiments]] did not wear trousers, favouring the kilt, and Scottish Lowland regiments adopted tartan [[trews]]. All [[Scottish regiment]]s wore [[Doublet (clothing)|doublets]] of distinctive cut instead of the tunics of English, Irish and Welsh units.\n\nFull dress headwear varied (both from regiment to regiment, and over time as influenced by military fashion): bearskins were worn by the Foot Guards, the [[2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys)]] and (in a different form) by Fusiliers. Plumed helmets were worn by the Dragoons (except 2nd), Dragoon Guards and the Household Cavalry. Hussars wore their distinctive [[Busby (military headdress)|busby]], which also came to be adopted by the Royal Artillery, the Royal Engineers and certain other Corps; it was also worn in a different form by Rifle regiments. The Lancers had their [[chapka]]. Infantry of the line often wore shakos (later supplanted by the 'home service helmet'), as did others; though Scots and Irish regiments tended to have their own distinctive full-dress headwear. General officers and staff officers usually wore plumed [[cocked hat]]s in full dress, as did regimental staff officers and those of some support services. In hotter climates, for all of the above, a white [[pith helmet]] was often substituted.\n[[File:Battle of Abu Klea, William Barnes Wollen.jpg|thumb|left|The rise of [[rifle]]s and [[smokeless powder]] led to the adoption of [[khaki]] uniforms in the field, with blue, scarlet, and rifle green tunics relegated to ceremonial/parade use.]]\nBeginning with the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1878, the British Army began adopting light [[khaki]] uniforms for [[Tropical]] service that was first introduced in 1848 with the [[Corps of Guides (India)|Corps of Guides]] in India.<ref>\"Khaki Uniform 1848\u201349: First Introduction by Lumsden and Hodson\", Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research; JSAHR 82 (Winter 2004); pp 341\u2013347</ref> This innovation arose from experience fighting irregular forces in India, for example on the Indian North-West Frontier and during the [[Indian Mutiny]], and in Africa during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], as well as the invention of [[smokeless gunpowder]] and the increasing effectiveness and usage of rifles. In 1902 a darker shade of ''[[Service Dress (British Army)|Service Dress]]'' (SD) was adopted for field and ordinary use in Britain itself.  The scarlet, blue and rifle green uniforms were retained for wear as full dress on parade and \"walking-out dress\" when off duty and out of barracks. As worn between 1902 and 1914 by all non-commissioned ranks, walking-out dress was essentially the same as review order, except that a peaked cap or glengarry was worn instead of the full dress headdress and overalls (strapped trousers) were substituted for cavalry breeches.<ref>Major R. M. Barnes, pages=236 & 237, \"Military Uniforms of Britain and the Empire\", Sphere Books Ltd, 1972</ref>\n\nWhen khaki web carrying equipment was introduced, the earlier, white or black leather carrying equipment was retained for wear with the dress uniform. As with the earlier uniforms, the officers' uniforms differed in quality and detail from those worn by the [[Other ranks (UK)|Other Ranks]]. Officers purchased their own dress uniforms from regimentally approved [[tailor]]s while other ranks were issued all orders of dress from government stocks.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 all full dress and other coloured uniforms ceased to be worn by the British Army. After 1919 they were restored to the [[Household Cavalry]] and Foot Guard for ceremonial purposes but not to the bulk of the army. Officers were authorised to wear full dress for certain special occasions such as Court levees (formal presentations to the Monarch) and it was customary to wear these uniforms at social functions such as weddings. By 1928 bands were wearing full dress on occasions where they were not parading with the remainder of the regiment (who had only khaki service dress). The pre-1914 dress uniforms were still held in store and occasionally reappeared for historic displays. However, there was no serious attempt to make them general issue again, primarily for reasons of expense.  When (khaki) Battle Dress (BD) uniforms, which had a short ''blouse'' instead of a tunic, were adopted immediately before the Second World War, the older khaki Service Dress became a smart uniform for wear on the streets, and on moderately formal occasions.\n\nAfter World War II the coloured, full dress uniforms were again reintroduced for ceremonial occasions by the [[Brigade of Guards]] and to a limited extent by regimental bands. Officers (and later senior non-commissioned officers) resumed wearing [[mess uniform]]s in traditional colours from about 1956 on. These are still worn, although regimental  amalgamations have led to numerous changes from the pre-war models.\n[[File:The Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scottish regiment]]s retain a number of historical elements in their uniform, including their [[kilt]]s and [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]]s]]\nWith limited exceptions, the unique regimental full dress uniforms finally disappeared after 1939; today they are only generally worn, on ceremonial occasions, by the Bands and [[Corps of Drums]], by certain representatives on parade (e.g. some regimental [[Pioneer Sergeant|Pioneers]], or those forming a guard of honour) and by the regiments of the [[Household Division]].  In most regiments they were replaced by a generic dark blue uniform known as No 1 Dress. This dated back to plain \"patrol\" uniforms worn by officers before 1914 as an informal \"undress\" uniform. An early version had been worn by some units in the 1937 [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth]] but had not been made general issue at the time. In the form adopted after World War II, most regiments were distinguished only by coloured piping on the shoulder straps, coloured hat bands, buttons and badges. However Scottish regiments retained their kilts or trews as well as the distinctive doublets (in \"piper green\" or dark blue) of the former scarlet uniform.\n\nRifles regiments had dark green uniforms and cavalry retained a number of special features such as the crimson trousers of the [[11th Hussars]] or the quartered caps of lancer regiments.  A white, lightweight tunic (No 3 Dress) was also authorised for use in the [[tropics]], or during the summer months in warmer temperate climates (such as [[Bermuda Garrison|Bermuda]]). The blue \"home service\" helmets were not worn as part of the No 1 dress uniform, except by members of some bands or corps of drums which retained their old full dress uniforms, at regimental expense. English Rifle regiments were amalgamated into the [[Royal Green Jackets]], which continued to wear a dark green dress uniform, and black buttons and belts. Recent changes have brought the [[Royal Green Jackets]] and [[The Light Infantry]] together into a single regiment [[The Rifles]], which continues to wear dark green.\n[[File:Waterloo Band of The Rifles.jpg|thumb|The Waterloo Band of [[The Rifles]] in full dress. The Rifles continue to use [[rifle green]] in their full dress uniform.]]\nBerets were introduced initially into the [[Royal Tank Corps]] in the First World War and their use became more widespread in the British Army during and after the Second World War to replace side caps for wear with combat uniforms when protective headgear was not being worn. Originally, khaki was the standard colour for all units, but specialist units adopted coloured berets to distinguish themselves. For example, [[airborne forces]] adopted a [[Maroon (color)|maroon]]. This has since been adopted by many other parachute units around the world. The [[British Commandos|Commandos]] adopted a [[green beret]]. The [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) initially adopted a white beret quickly changing this to a [[beige]] or sand coloured one.  From 1944 they wore the Maroon airborne forces beret but the beige beret was re-adopted following the re-formation of the Regular SAS in Malaya.\nKhaki was replaced as a generic colour for berets after the war by dark blue, and this is the colour worn by those units not authorised to use a distinctively coloured beret.\n\nA peaked cap, with a coloured hat band, is intended to be worn with the No 1 Dress uniform, berets are the most common form of headdress seen with other orders of dress and are worn in No1 and 2 dress by some Regiments and Corps. \n\nThe blue or green No 1 Dress was never universally adopted after its initial introduction in 1947. The reason was mainly one of economy, although it was sometimes criticised as being too similar to police and other civilian uniforms \u2013 lacking the immediately recognisable military status of both scarlet and khaki. Khaki No 2 dress being the most usual order of dress for parades and formal occasions.\n[[File:Inspection-New-Colours.JPG|thumb|Officer cadets at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in full dress.]]\nAs noted above, the practice of issuing other ranks in line regiments with full sets of both service dress and dress uniforms effectively ended in 1914 and was never completely returned to. Today, with the exceptions noted above, full dress or No 1 Dress uniforms are only held in limited quantities as common stock, and issued only to detachments on occasional special ceremonial occasions. Practices do however vary between units and historic items of uniform are more likely to appear where tradition is particularly strong. As an example, the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] wore scarlet and blue \"review order\" uniforms until World War I, substituted khaki service dress for parade from 1919 to 1939  and now holds dark blue No 1 dress uniforms for the use of its cadets. The [[Royal Military Police]] retain the latter order of dress for general issue{{cn|date=February 2020}}.\n\n==== Royal Air Force ====\n{{See also|Uniforms of the Royal Air Force}}\n[[File:Sir Philip Game.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Philip Game]] in full dress, c. 1930. At the time, the [[Royal Air Force]]'s full dress included headgear that resembled helmets used in [[World War I]].]]\nHistorically, the [[Royal Air Force]] regulations permitted the wearing of a full dress uniform in both home and warm-weather variants. Although the home wear version of full dress is no longer worn (except in a modified form by RAF bandsmen),<ref>[http://www.britairforce.com/imagepages/raf_uniform_music.htm]</ref> the tropical full ceremonial dress continues to be authorised.\n\nThe temperate full dress uniform was introduced in April 1920. It consisted of a single-breasted jacket in blue-grey with a stand-up collar. Rank was indicated in gold braid on the lower sleeve and white gloves were worn. As with the British Army after 1914, full dress was not general issue during the inter-War period, but was authorized for wear by specific categories such as bandsmen and commissioned officers. The latter generally wore full dress only for infrequent occasions such as attendance at court [[levees]] and social functions such as weddings. Military attaches and royal [[aides de camp]] were amongst the few serving officers who might have regular occasions to wear full dress.\n\nInitially the full dress uniform was worn with the service dress cap. However, in 1921 a new form of head-dress was introduced. It was designed to resemble the original flying helmet and it consisted of a leather skull cap trimmed with black rabbit fur. The helmet also featured an ostrich feather plume which was connected to an RAF badge. This helmet was never popular and junior officers were eventually permitted to wear the service dress hat on full dress occasions.\n\n[[Group Captain]] the Duke of York (later [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]) wore RAF full dress at his wedding to Lady [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923. The Duke wore or carried the full dress headgear rather than the service dress cap.\n\n====Royal Navy====\n{{Further|Uniforms of the Royal Navy}}\n[[File:Vaspw.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vice Admiral]] [[Philip Watson]] in ceremonial day dress. Introduced in 1960, ceremonial day dress is a variant of the [[Royal Navy]]'s full dress uniform that was taken out of service in 1956.]]\nSince the mid-eighteenth century, when naval uniforms were introduced, Flag Officers had different full-dress and undress versions, the latter being worn from day to day, the former only for formal occasions. By the late nineteenth century, an officer's full dress uniform consisted of a navy double-breasted tailcoat with white facings edged in gold (on the collar and cuff-slashes), gold lace (indicating rank) on the cuffs, epaulettes, sword and sword-belt, worn with gold-laced trousers and a cocked hat. This order of uniform lasted through the first half of the twentieth century, and was worn by Prince Philip at the Coronation of Elizabeth II. In 1956, however, it was abolished, leaving No. 1 uniform as the most formal order of dress. Subsequently, in 1960, full dress uniform was reintroduced in the form of [[Royal Navy uniform#Ceremonial Day Dress|Ceremonial Day Dress]]. Worn only by limited categories of senior officers this is very similar to the old full dress, but without fringed epaulettes and slashes, and worn with a peaked cap.\n\n====Civilian organisations====\nThe formal uniforms used by police forces were until the late 20th century mostly the same as the uniforms worn on ordinary duties but sometimes with various embellishments. The introduction of newer uniforms deliberately designed as workwear has left the older styles mainly used for ceremonial or formal purposes. The general formal style is a black jacket and trousers with a white shirt and a [[custodian helmet]] or peaked cap. A particular variation is that used by mounted police in Merseyside which can be observed when they escort the winner of the annual Grand National horse race at Aintree; this consists of the traditional ''Custodian helmet'' with an added white plume and silvered chinstrap; along with the style of tunic it bears more resemblance to a late 19th/early 20th century police uniform.\n\n=== United States ===\n====U.S. Air Force====\n{{Further|Uniforms of the United States Air Force}}\nIn the mid-1980s, \"ceremonial blue\" uniform and \"ceremonial white\" uniform were introduced in the [[United States Air Force]].

Before 1998, certain ceremonial Marine units, such as the [[Silent Drill Platoon]], wore a blue/white dress uniform in which white trousers were substituted for blue while performing ceremonial functions. The blue/white version is now an authorized summer uniform for officers, SNCOs, and on certain functions, NCOs. The Marine Corps Mounted Colour Guard currently wears the blue dress coat with white riding breeches and polished black knee-high riding boots<ref>{{cite web|last=Sanders|first=Denise|title=The magic of the 125th Tournament of Roses Parade|url=http://darkroom.baltimoresun.com/2014/01/the-magic-of-the-125th-tournament-of-roses-parade/#15|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=2 January 2014}}</ref> although in the past they have worn blue riding breeches with the red blood stripe.<ref>{{cite web|last=U.S. Bureau of Land Management|title=Wild Horse & Burro Program and the United States Marine Corps Color Guard|url=http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/prog/wild_horse_and_burro/Color_Guard.print.html|publisher=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIORBUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT|accessdate=2 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103063241/http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/prog/wild_horse_and_burro/Color_Guard.print.html|archive-date=3 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAnother uniform, the obsolete Dress White uniform, was a white version of the standard dress coat and trousers, was authorized only for officers, and resembled the Navy's Officer/CPO dress whites. No blood stripes were authorized, and white shoes were worn. This uniform was superseded by the Blue/White Dress uniform in 2000.\n\n==== U.S. Navy ====\n{{Further|Uniforms of the United States Navy}}\nThe Dress White uniform consists of a stand-collar white tunic, white trousers, and white dress shoes. Rank for officers is displayed on [[shoulder marks]] for males and on the sleeve cuffs for females, while CPO rank insignia is worn on the collar for both sexes. Service dress white includes service ribbons, whereas full dress white includes service ribbons and medals. This uniform is informally called \"Chokers\", due to the stand-collar.\n[[File:US Navy 091002-N-3442D-001 Members of the U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard stand at parade rest before the start of the retirement ceremony for Rear Adm. Jon W. Bayless Jr. and Rear Adm. Edward.jpg|thumb|Enlisted sailors of the [[United States Navy]] in Full Dress Whites during a retirement ceremony.]]\nThe Dress Blue uniform consists of black shoes, navy blue (black in appearance) coat and trousers, a white shirt and either a [[Windsor knot|Windsor]] or formal bowtie. As with the white uniforms, only service ribbons are worn with Service Dress Blue, while service ribbons and medals are worn with Full Dress Blue. Depending on the occasion, officers may also wear [[sword]]s with either Full Dress White or Blue. Both the white and blue uniforms are worn with the distinctive peaked cap with white cover.\n\nNaval enlisted personnel ranked [[Petty Officer First Class]], E-6, and below also have seasonal uniforms. The dress white and blue uniforms are both of the traditional \"[[sailor suit]]\" or [[Cracker Jack|crackerjack]] type for men, and women wear the same as summertime dress white uniform. It consists of a pullover shirt, called a [[Sweater|jumper]], with a V-neck going to a square collar flap, a black [[neckerchief]], and bell-bottomed trousers. The white uniform is worn with a white belt and silver buckle, and the sleeves come down to the middle of the hand. The blue uniform features the thirteen button trousers, and has three rows of white piping on the collar and cuffs. Women wear a uniform similar to female officers and Chiefs, but with silver buttons, and a cover device with a spread eagle and \"USN\".\n\n====U.S. Coast Guard====\nBefore 1972, U.S. Coast Guard personnel generally wore the same uniforms as the U.S. Navy but with distinctive Coast Guard insignia, primarily distinctive cap devices for officers and chief petty officers, incorporation of the Coast Guard shield in lieu of line or staff corps insignia for officers, and differentiated uniform buttons on dress uniforms.\n[[File:Coast Guard Full Dress Blue uniform.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[United States Coast Guard]] in Full Dress Blue during a change of command ceremony at [[Coast Guard Base Kodiak]].]]\nPresently, the U.S. Coast Guard maintains two full dress uniforms, full dress blue, and full dress white.<ref name=uscg/> Full dress blue is worn during change of command ceremonies, parades, and reviews when special honours are being paid, including state visits.<ref name=uscg/> The full dress blue uniforms are similar to the U.S. Coast Guard's service dress blue \"Alpha,\" except that it is worn with a full-size medals instead of ribbons. Additionally, a sword may be prescribed for officers, and a white belt and glove may be required.\n\nFull Dress White is worn for similar occasions by officers of the U.S. Coast Guard during the summer, or when in tropical environments.<ref name=uscg/> The Dress White uniform is slightly different depending on the gender; with men wearing a high stand-collared white tunic, white trousers, and white shoes, while women wear a uniform similar to the dress blue uniform but with a white coat and skirt or trousers. Both genders wear shoulder boards rather than sleeve stripes, as well as medals, combination cover, and sword. The uniform is nearly identical to the U.S. Navy's Full Dress Whites, but the buttons and combination cover device are Coast Guard specific.\n\nThe [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] maintains two different styles of parade dress uniforms. Both variants include a black blouse, with banded collars and double row of buttons, and a white peaked hat. However, Full Dress Blue A, uses white trousers, whereas Full Dress Blue B uses black trousers.\n\n=== Venezuela ===\nWithin the [[National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela]] dress uniforms are commonplace within its services.\n\nThe Presidential Honor Guard Brigade wears dress uniforms similar to those used by the Hussar troop raised by Simon Bolivar in 1816. It is of a red tunic with gold buttons and black pants, belt and a black (formerly brown) busby hat, plus epaulettes worn by officers. The Caracas Battalion of the Ministry of Defence wears a light blue uniform with white buttons, black pants, a belt, boots or black shoes and the red beret while the Daniel O'Leary Battalion of the Army Headquarters wears an identical uniform but with the dark blue beret.\n\n==Full dress uniform by non-directly military organisations==\n===St John Ambulance===\n{{further|Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)}}\n[[File:SJAM Parade1.jpg|thumb|Individuals leading a group of [[St John Ambulance of Malaysia]] (SJAM) volunteers wearing SJAM's ceremonial uniform.]]\n[[St John Ambulance]] is a volunteer group of affiliated organisations in 42 countries, which aims to teach and provide [[first aid]], and [[emergency medical services]]. The organisation uses a number of uniforms, including a ceremonial one. The affiliated national organisations do not share a standardized ceremonial uniform, known as formal uniform or dress uniform depending on the country.\n\nThe uniform of St John Ambulance in [[St. John Ambulance Canada|Canada]], [[St John Ambulance in England|England]], [[St John Ambulance Ireland|Ireland]], and [[St John Ambulance in Wales|Wales]] was derived from the uniforms of London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]]; using similar jackets and trousers with different buttons, badges, and a cap with a white band and belt-mounted items relevant to first-aid work. Conversely, the ceremonial uniform for St John Ambulance in [[St John Ambulance of Malaysia|Malaysia]], and [[St John Singapore]] uses a white tunic and black trousers; derived from the British Army's warm weather ceremonial uniform. Generally, the organisation's ceremonial uniform is not used for daily medical and first-aid work, with the various national St John Ambulance organisations issuing a variety of occupational uniforms.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Military uniform]]\n**[[Mess dress uniform]]\n**[[Service dress uniform]]\n**[[Combat uniform]]\n* [[Formal wear]]\n** [[Morning dress]]\n** [[White tie]]\n** [[Ceremonial dress]]\n** [[Religious clothing]]\n** [[Folk costume]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline|Full dress uniforms}}\n\n{{Clothing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dress Uniform}}\n[[Category:Military uniforms]]\n[[Category:Formal wear]]\n[[Category:Uniforms]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the most formal military uniform|military uniforms in general|military uniform}}\n{{short description|Uniform for wear on formal occasions}}\n[[File:Lord Mayor's Show 2005 (62867328).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A [[trooper]] and a [[Cornet <!-- (rank) -->]] of the [[Blues and Royals]], a [[British Army]] cavalry regiment, in full dress uniform.]]\n{{Western dress codes}}\n'''Full dress uniform''' or '''parade dress uniform''' is the most [[formal wear|formal]] type of [[uniform]]s used by [[military]], [[police]], [[firefighter|fire]] and other public [[uniformed services]] for official [[parade (military)|parade]]s, [[ceremonies]], and receptions, including private ones such as [[marriage]]s and [[funeral]]s. Full dress uniforms typically include full-size [[order (distinction)|orders]] and [[medal]]s [[insignia]]. Styles tend to trace back to uniforms used during the 19th century, although the 20th century saw the adoption of [[mess dress uniform|mess-dress]] styled full-dress uniforms. Designs may depend on [[regiment]] or [[service branch]] (e.g. [[army]], [[navy]], [[air force]], [[marines]]). In [[Western dress codes]], full dress uniform is a permitted supplementary alternative equivalent to the [[civilian]] [[white tie]] for evening wear or [[morning dress]] for day wear \u2013 sometimes collectively called ''[[full dress]]'' \u2013 although military uniforms are the same for day and evening wear. As such, full dress uniform is the most formal uniform, followed by the [[mess dress uniform]].\n\nAlthough full dress uniforms are often brightly coloured and ornamented with gold [[epaulettes]], [[braid]]s, [[lanyard]]s, [[lampasse]]s, etc., most originated as practical uniforms that, with the adoption of even more practical uniforms, were relegated to ceremonial functions. Before [[World War I]], most armed forces of the world retained uniforms of this type that were usually more colourful and elaborate than the ordinary duty (known as ''[[undress]]''), or the active [[service dress uniform]].<ref>{{cite book|first=W.Y.|last=Carman|page=61|title=A Dictionary of Military Uniforms|isbn=0-684-15130-8|year=1977}}</ref>\n\nWhile full dress uniform is predominantly worn at occasions by [[commissioned officer]]s and [[non-commissioned officer]]s, it may also be worn as an optional uniform by some senior [[enlisted personnel]]. It is also sometimes worn by members of [[royal court]]s, [[order of chivalry|orders of chivalry]] or certain civilian uniformed services, although some of these may border to [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom|court uniforms]].\n\n{{toc limit|4}}\n\n==Name==\n\"Full dress uniform\" is often applied in order to distinguish from [[semi-formal]] [[mess dress uniform]]s, as well as [[informal wear|informal]] [[service dress uniform]]s.\n\nYet, full dress uniform is sometimes called ''dress uniform''. Although many services use the term ''dress'' generically for uniforms, allowing it to refer to more modern service dress (\"combat\") uniforms with suitable modifiers (e.g. the [[British Army]]'s obsolete [[Battle Dress]]; and the [[U.S. Army]]'s obsolete [[Battle Dress Uniform]]). Therefore, the term ''dress uniform'' without prefix typically refers to full dress uniform as described in this article.\n\n==History==\nThe [[British Army|British]] and [[United States Army|United States armies]] were dependent upon voluntary [[military recruitment|recruiting]] and found that a smart dress served to attract recruits and improve morale amongst those already serving. The British [[regiment|regimental system]] fostered numerous distinctions amongst different units.\n\nHowever, this was not limited to volunteer armies, with [[conscription|conscript]] armies of continental Europe retaining many of the colourful features that had evolved during the nineteenth century, for reasons of national and unit pride. Thus, in 1913 most French soldiers wore red [[trouser]]s and [[kepi]]s as part of their full dress,<ref>{{cite book|first=Andre|last=Jouineau|pages=7\u201359|title=French Army in 1914|isbn=978-2-35250-104-6|year=2008}}</ref> the majority of British foot regiments retained the [[Red coat (military uniform)|scarlet tunic]]s for [[parade]] and off duty (\"walking out\"),<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Harrington|pages=10\u2013146|title=British Army Uniforms in Color|isbn=0-7643-1302-9|year=2001}}</ref> the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] was characterised by [[Prussian blue]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl|last=Becker|pages=11\u201314|title=The Kaiser's Army in Color|isbn=0-7643-1173-5|year=2000}}</ref> the Russian by dark green,<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert W.|last=Kennedy|pages=8\u201327|title=Uniforms of Imperial & Soviet Russia|isbn=0-7643-1320-7|year=2001}}</ref> and the Austro-Hungary Army by a wide range of differing [[Facing (sewing)|facing colours]] dating back to the 18th century.<ref>James Lucas, \"Fighting Troops of the Austro-Hungarian Army 1868-1914, {{ISBN|0-87052-362-7}}</ref>\n\nThere were usually exceptions to each of these rules, often distinguishing unique units. This included the German [[cuirassier]]s, who wore white full dress; British [[rifle regiment]]s, who wore [[rifle green]]; and French mountain troops who wore large [[beret]]s and light blue trousers. The U.S. Army with its \"dress blues\" was an exception, with [[cavalry]], [[artillery]] and [[infantry]] being distinguished only by the different branch colours.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition, Volume XXVII, pages 592\u2013593</ref>\n\nAfter World War I most full dress uniforms disappeared. Many of the regimes that had taken a particular pride in the retention of colourful traditional uniforms had been overthrown and their [[republic]]an, [[fascism|fascist]], or [[communism|communist]] successors had little incentive to retain old glories. Elsewhere cost and disillusion with the \"peacock\" aspects of old fashioned soldiering had a similar effect, except for ceremonial guard units and such limited exceptions as [[Officer (military)|officers]]' evening or off-duty uniforms.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Mollo|page=231|title=Military Fashion|isbn=0-214-65349-8}}</ref>\n\nModern armies are characterised by simple and drably coloured dress even for ceremonial occasion, with the exceptions noted above. However a general trend towards replacing conscript armies with long serving professionals has had, as a side effect, a reversion to dress uniforms that combine smartness with some traditional features. Thus the U.S. Army announced in 2006 that uniforms of modern cut but in the traditional dark and light blue colours will become universal issue, replacing the previous grey/green service dress. The French Army has, with the abolition of conscription, reintroduced kepis, fringed [[epaulettes]] and sashes in traditional colours to wear with [[camouflage]] \"trellis\" or light beige parade dress.<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Galliac|pages=89\u201390|title=L' Armee Francaise|isbn=978-2-35250-195-4|year=2012}}</ref> The British Army with its strong regimental traditions has retained a wide range of special features and dress items to distinguish individual units, in spite of recent amalgamations.<ref>Section 01.200, ''Army Dress Regulations (All Ranks)'', Ministry of Defence, January 2011</ref>  Although there still exist official patterns for full dress uniforms for each regiment or corps within the British Army, this uniform is seldom issued at public expense, except for units which are often on [[public duties]], such as the [[Guards Division]], Regimental Bands and [[Corps of Drums]], which are bought from the Regiment's allowance.<ref name=\"jsp336-3-12-1\">{{cite book|title = Joint Service Publication 336: The Defence Supply Chain Manual|edition = 3rd|url = http://www.aof.mod.uk/content/docs/jsp336/3rd_ed/vol12/pt3/pam12/s1.doc|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071106000709/http://www.aof.mod.uk/content/docs/jsp336/3rd_ed/vol12/pt3/pam12/s1.doc|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2007-11-06|accessdate = |author = British Army Dress Committee|date = August 2005|volume = Vol. 12''', Part 3, Pamphlet 12, Sect. 1 '''|page = Para. 117, 119}}</ref>\n\n==Full dress uniform by country==\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Banda Militar del Regimiento de Infanter\u00eda de Patricios 2016 001.jpg|thumb|The [[Regiment of Patricians]] is one of several units in the [[Argentine Army]] whose full dress uniform dates back to the 19th century.]] \nIn the [[Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic]], the [[Argentine Federal Police]], Argentine National Gendarmrie and Naval Prefecture, dress uniforms are worn during military and civil occasions, especially for the [[military band]]s and [[colour guard]]s.

When wearing the Mess dress uniform, no headdress is worn.\n\nThe \"PDU III\" uniform is worn during receptions and/or during the welcoming ceremony of a visiting high ranking foreign guest ([[head of state]] or head of government). While the \"PDU IV\" uniform is worn for occasions such as: [[Change of Command]] ceremonies, attending a [[passing out parade]], and worn by [[Military justice|military judges]] in the court.<ref>[https://dokumen.tips/documents/penggunaan-kelengkapan-dan-atribut-tni-ad.html Usage, Attributes, and Uniform of the Indonesian Army ]</ref> The mess dress uniform is basically the same for the three branches of the armed forces.

These are similar in style to civilian business dress suits, or to the service dress uniforms worn by the British forces. The dress uniform includes a [[Blazer|blazer-type]] jacket, worn with a white shirt, and a tie. The ground forces uniform is dark green, with a single-breasted, three-buttoned jacket and tie of the same colour. Headgear worn is the beret. The air force uniform is of the same design, but medium blue. The naval uniform has a darker blue, double-breasted, six-buttoned jacket, with gold-coloured rank insignia on the cuffs.<ref>[http://www.timesofisrael.com/generals-get-a-makeover-with-new-dress-uniforms/ '' Dressed to kill: Generals get a makeover with new dress uniforms'', by Judah Ari Gross.

Prior to 2016, the dress uniform, the ''Madei Srad'' was only worn abroad, either by a [[military attach\u00e9]] or by senior officers on official [[state visit]]s.\n\n=== Russia ===\n{{Further|Uniforms of the Russian Armed Forces}}\nThe uniforms of the [[Russian Armed Forces]] were inherited from the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and modified throughout the years. Some features of modern full dress uniform worn by both army and navy personnel date from those of the final Czarist period, prior to 1917. Most notably these include the blue-green shade of the modern army officer's parade and walking out uniform; the dark blue and white dress uniform still worn by sailors; and the ceremonial dress of the Kremlin Regiment.\n\n=== Sweden===\n{{Further|Swedish Military Uniform}}\n{{see also|Mess dress uniform#Full mess dress}}\n[[File:Swedish Royal Guard Bastille Day 2007.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Officer of the Life Company of the Swedish Lifeguards (2007)]]\nVarious forms of full dress uniforms were used by all regiments of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] for ceremonial purposes until the 1960s, when they were generally discontinued, with the exception of the [[Svea Life Guards]] and the [[Life Guard Dragoons (Sweden)|Life Guard Dragoons]] still retaining colourful full dress uniforms of 19th century origin for ceremonial use. The remaining parts of the branches tend to apply a variant of the [[mess dress uniform]] called \"full mess uniform\" for formal wear purposes. White [[Spats (footwear)|spats]] and belts may also be added to their service dress uniforms for parades or certain ceremonial purposes.\n\n==== Swedish Army ====\nThere are three versions of full dress uniforms in use in the [[Swedish Army]] as of the present day, all belonging to the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]]. The infantry wears the dark blue uniform of the Svea Life Guards (1st Life Guards) with yellow collar, cuffs and piping which dates back to 1886. The [[Royal Swedish Army Band|Swedish Army Band]] wears the uniform of G\u00f6ta Life Guards (2nd Life Guards), with red collar, cuffs and piping. The headdress of the infantry is mainly the pickelhaube typed helmet in black leather from 1887. On state ceremonies, a white buffalo hair plume is added. [[Bearskin hat]]s dating from 1823 are still in use on special occasions.\n\nThe cavalry, including the [[Life Guards' Dragoon Music Corps|Swedish Cavalry Band]], wear the [[royal blue]] uniform of the Life Guard Dragoons (1st Cavalry) from 1895. Officers have a somewhat lighter colour on their full dress uniform compared to the troopers. The pickelhaube type helmet is made of nickel-plated steel with [[brass]] details and dates back to 1879. Changes were made in 1900 which transformed the helmet into a cuirassier style helmet. In 1928 with the amalgamation of the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Regiments, a helm wreath was added, together with a golden laurel wreath. Officers' gold chin straps with lion \"mascarons\" from the [[Life Regiment Dragoons]] (2nd Cavalry) were also authorised for the new composite regiment. On modern state occasions officers wear white buffalo hair plume while troopers wear a horse hair plumes of the same colour.\n\n==== Swedish Navy ====\n[[File:Royal Wedding Stockholm 2010 0c176 2128.jpg|thumb|Two officers in full dress on the royal barge ''Vasaorden''. In the [[Swedish Navy]], full dress is restricted to naval officers serving on the ''Vasaorden'']]\nIn the [[Swedish Navy]], only one ceremonial uniform is still in use. It is restricted to naval officers serving on the royal barge \"Vasaorden\" (Order of Vasa); a ship used only on rare ceremonial occasions. The uniform dates back to 1878.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n==== British Army ====\n{{Main|Uniforms of the British Army}}\nMost of the various uniforms worn by the [[British Army Uniforms|British Army]] today originate in former combat uniforms. At the start of the 19th century, British Army [[Regiment of Foot|Regiments of Foot]], trained to fight in the manner dictated by a weapon (the [[musket]]) which demanded close proximity to the target, were not concerned with camouflage, and wore red coats (scarlet for officers and sergeants). Rifle regiments, fighting as [[skirmishers]], and equipped with [[rifle]]s, were more concerned with concealment however, and wore dark green uniforms. [[Light Infantry]] regiments were also trained as skirmishers but wore red uniforms with green shakos. Whereas the infantry generally wore polished brass [[button]]s and white carrying equipment, the Rifles wore black.\n[[File:British old infantry uniforms.jpg|thumb|Infantry uniforms of the [[British Army]], from 1750\u20131835. Full dress uniforms in the British Army originate from former combat uniforms.]]\nHeavy [[dragoon]]s and [[Royal Engineers]] wore red (or later scarlet) coats. Most of the remainder of the British Army, however, including the [[Royal Regiment of Artillery]], [[hussar]]s, all but one [[lancer]] regiment, and various support elements wore dark blue uniforms{{cn|date=February 2020}}. These varied greatly in detail according to the arm of service or in many cases the individual regiment. [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Reserve]] units were for the most part distinguished by having silver (rather than gold-coloured) lace, buttons and accoutrements in full dress. From the [[Crimean War]] on, a narrow red stripe (piping) down the outside of each trouser leg was common to all red coated infantry units. Cavalry however wore stripes of regimental colour (white, yellow, blue/grey etc.) on their riding breeches. Scottish [[:Category:Highland regiments|Highland regiments]] did not wear trousers, favouring the kilt, and Scottish Lowland regiments adopted tartan [[trews]]. All [[Scottish regiment]]s wore [[Doublet (clothing)|doublets]] of distinctive cut instead of the tunics of English, Irish and Welsh units.\n\nFull dress headwear varied (both from regiment to regiment, and over time as influenced by military fashion): bearskins were worn by the Foot Guards, the [[2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys)]] and (in a different form) by Fusiliers. Plumed helmets were worn by the Dragoons (except 2nd), Dragoon Guards and the Household Cavalry. Hussars wore their distinctive [[Busby (military headdress)|busby]], which also came to be adopted by the Royal Artillery, the Royal Engineers and certain other Corps; it was also worn in a different form by Rifle regiments. The Lancers had their [[chapka]]. Infantry of the line often wore shakos (later supplanted by the 'home service helmet'), as did others; though Scots and Irish regiments tended to have their own distinctive full-dress headwear. General officers and staff officers usually wore plumed [[cocked hat]]s in full dress, as did regimental staff officers and those of some support services. In hotter climates, for all of the above, a white [[pith helmet]] was often substituted.\n[[File:Battle of Abu Klea, William Barnes Wollen.jpg|thumb|left|The rise of [[rifle]]s and [[smokeless powder]] led to the adoption of [[khaki]] uniforms in the field, with blue, scarlet, and rifle green tunics relegated to ceremonial/parade use.]]\nBeginning with the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1878, the British Army began adopting light [[khaki]] uniforms for [[Tropical]] service that was first introduced in 1848 with the [[Corps of Guides (India)|Corps of Guides]] in India.<ref>\"Khaki Uniform 1848\u201349: First Introduction by Lumsden and Hodson\", Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research; JSAHR 82 (Winter 2004); pp 341\u2013347</ref> This innovation arose from experience fighting irregular forces in India, for example on the Indian North-West Frontier and during the [[Indian Mutiny]], and in Africa during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], as well as the invention of [[smokeless gunpowder]] and the increasing effectiveness and usage of rifles. In 1902 a darker shade of ''[[Service Dress (British Army)|Service Dress]]'' (SD) was adopted for field and ordinary use in Britain itself.  The scarlet, blue and rifle green uniforms were retained for wear as full dress on parade and \"walking-out dress\" when off duty and out of barracks. As worn between 1902 and 1914 by all non-commissioned ranks, walking-out dress was essentially the same as review order, except that a peaked cap or glengarry was worn instead of the full dress headdress and overalls (strapped trousers) were substituted for cavalry breeches.<ref>Major R. M. Barnes, pages=236 & 237, \"Military Uniforms of Britain and the Empire\", Sphere Books Ltd, 1972</ref>\n\nWhen khaki web carrying equipment was introduced, the earlier, white or black leather carrying equipment was retained for wear with the dress uniform. As with the earlier uniforms, the officers' uniforms differed in quality and detail from those worn by the [[Other ranks (UK)|Other Ranks]]. Officers purchased their own dress uniforms from regimentally approved [[tailor]]s while other ranks were issued all orders of dress from government stocks.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 all full dress and other coloured uniforms ceased to be worn by the British Army. After 1919 they were restored to the [[Household Cavalry]] and Foot Guard for ceremonial purposes but not to the bulk of the army. Officers were authorised to wear full dress for certain special occasions such as Court levees (formal presentations to the Monarch) and it was customary to wear these uniforms at social functions such as weddings. By 1928 bands were wearing full dress on occasions where they were not parading with the remainder of the regiment (who had only khaki service dress). The pre-1914 dress uniforms were still held in store and occasionally reappeared for historic displays. However, there was no serious attempt to make them general issue again, primarily for reasons of expense.  When (khaki) Battle Dress (BD) uniforms, which had a short ''blouse'' instead of a tunic, were adopted immediately before the Second World War, the older khaki Service Dress became a smart uniform for wear on the streets, and on moderately formal occasions.\n\nAfter World War II the coloured, full dress uniforms were again reintroduced for ceremonial occasions by the [[Brigade of Guards]] and to a limited extent by regimental bands. Officers (and later senior non-commissioned officers) resumed wearing [[mess uniform]]s in traditional colours from about 1956 on. These are still worn, although regimental  amalgamations have led to numerous changes from the pre-war models.\n[[File:The Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scottish regiment]]s retain a number of historical elements in their uniform, including their [[kilt]]s and [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]]s]]\nWith limited exceptions, the unique regimental full dress uniforms finally disappeared after 1939; today they are only generally worn, on ceremonial occasions, by the Bands and [[Corps of Drums]], by certain representatives on parade (e.g. some regimental [[Pioneer Sergeant|Pioneers]], or those forming a guard of honour) and by the regiments of the [[Household Division]].  In most regiments they were replaced by a generic dark blue uniform known as No 1 Dress. This dated back to plain \"patrol\" uniforms worn by officers before 1914 as an informal \"undress\" uniform. An early version had been worn by some units in the 1937 [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth]] but had not been made general issue at the time. In the form adopted after World War II, most regiments were distinguished only by coloured piping on the shoulder straps, coloured hat bands, buttons and badges. However Scottish regiments retained their kilts or trews as well as the distinctive doublets (in \"piper green\" or dark blue) of the former scarlet uniform.\n\nRifles regiments had dark green uniforms and cavalry retained a number of special features such as the crimson trousers of the [[11th Hussars]] or the quartered caps of lancer regiments.  A white, lightweight tunic (No 3 Dress) was also authorised for use in the [[tropics]], or during the summer months in warmer temperate climates (such as [[Bermuda Garrison|Bermuda]]). The blue \"home service\" helmets were not worn as part of the No 1 dress uniform, except by members of some bands or corps of drums which retained their old full dress uniforms, at regimental expense. English Rifle regiments were amalgamated into the [[Royal Green Jackets]], which continued to wear a dark green dress uniform, and black buttons and belts. Recent changes have brought the [[Royal Green Jackets]] and [[The Light Infantry]] together into a single regiment [[The Rifles]], which continues to wear dark green.\n[[File:Waterloo Band of The Rifles.jpg|thumb|The Waterloo Band of [[The Rifles]] in full dress. The Rifles continue to use [[rifle green]] in their full dress uniform.]]\nBerets were introduced initially into the [[Royal Tank Corps]] in the First World War and their use became more widespread in the British Army during and after the Second World War to replace side caps for wear with combat uniforms when protective headgear was not being worn. Originally, khaki was the standard colour for all units, but specialist units adopted coloured berets to distinguish themselves. For example, [[airborne forces]] adopted a [[Maroon (color)|maroon]]. This has since been adopted by many other parachute units around the world. The [[British Commandos|Commandos]] adopted a [[green beret]]. The [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) initially adopted a white beret quickly changing this to a [[beige]] or sand coloured one.  From 1944 they wore the Maroon airborne forces beret but the beige beret was re-adopted following the re-formation of the Regular SAS in Malaya.\nKhaki was replaced as a generic colour for berets after the war by dark blue, and this is the colour worn by those units not authorised to use a distinctively coloured beret.\n\nA peaked cap, with a coloured hat band, is intended to be worn with the No 1 Dress uniform, berets are the most common form of headdress seen with other orders of dress and are worn in No1 and 2 dress by some Regiments and Corps. \n\nThe blue or green No 1 Dress was never universally adopted after its initial introduction in 1947. The reason was mainly one of economy, although it was sometimes criticised as being too similar to police and other civilian uniforms \u2013 lacking the immediately recognisable military status of both scarlet and khaki. Khaki No 2 dress being the most usual order of dress for parades and formal occasions.\n[[File:Inspection-New-Colours.JPG|thumb|Officer cadets at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in full dress.]]\nAs noted above, the practice of issuing other ranks in line regiments with full sets of both service dress and dress uniforms effectively ended in 1914 and was never completely returned to. Today, with the exceptions noted above, full dress or No 1 Dress uniforms are only held in limited quantities as common stock, and issued only to detachments on occasional special ceremonial occasions. Practices do however vary between units and historic items of uniform are more likely to appear where tradition is particularly strong. As an example, the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] wore scarlet and blue \"review order\" uniforms until World War I, substituted khaki service dress for parade from 1919 to 1939  and now holds dark blue No 1 dress uniforms for the use of its cadets. The [[Royal Military Police]] retain the latter order of dress for general issue{{cn|date=February 2020}}.\n\n==== Royal Air Force ====\n{{See also|Uniforms of the Royal Air Force}}\n[[File:Sir Philip Game.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Philip Game]] in full dress, c. 1930. At the time, the [[Royal Air Force]]'s full dress included headgear that resembled helmets used in [[World War I]].]]\nHistorically, the [[Royal Air Force]] regulations permitted the wearing of a full dress uniform in both home and warm-weather variants. Although the home wear version of full dress is no longer worn (except in a modified form by RAF bandsmen),<ref>[http://www.britairforce.com/imagepages/raf_uniform_music.htm]</ref> the tropical full ceremonial dress continues to be authorised.\n\nThe temperate full dress uniform was introduced in April 1920. It consisted of a single-breasted jacket in blue-grey with a stand-up collar. Rank was indicated in gold braid on the lower sleeve and white gloves were worn. As with the British Army after 1914, full dress was not general issue during the inter-War period, but was authorized for wear by specific categories such as bandsmen and commissioned officers. The latter generally wore full dress only for infrequent occasions such as attendance at court [[levees]] and social functions such as weddings. Military attaches and royal [[aides de camp]] were amongst the few serving officers who might have regular occasions to wear full dress.\n\nInitially the full dress uniform was worn with the service dress cap. However, in 1921 a new form of head-dress was introduced. It was designed to resemble the original flying helmet and it consisted of a leather skull cap trimmed with black rabbit fur. The helmet also featured an ostrich feather plume which was connected to an RAF badge. This helmet was never popular and junior officers were eventually permitted to wear the service dress hat on full dress occasions.\n\n[[Group Captain]] the Duke of York (later [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]) wore RAF full dress at his wedding to Lady [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923. The Duke wore or carried the full dress headgear rather than the service dress cap.\n\n====Royal Navy====\n{{Further|Uniforms of the Royal Navy}}\n[[File:Vaspw.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vice Admiral]] [[Philip Watson]] in ceremonial day dress. Introduced in 1960, ceremonial day dress is a variant of the [[Royal Navy]]'s full dress uniform that was taken out of service in 1956.]]\nSince the mid-eighteenth century, when naval uniforms were introduced, Flag Officers had different full-dress and undress versions, the latter being worn from day to day, the former only for formal occasions. By the late nineteenth century, an officer's full dress uniform consisted of a navy double-breasted tailcoat with white facings edged in gold (on the collar and cuff-slashes), gold lace (indicating rank) on the cuffs, epaulettes, sword and sword-belt, worn with gold-laced trousers and a cocked hat. This order of uniform lasted through the first half of the twentieth century, and was worn by Prince Philip at the Coronation of Elizabeth II. In 1956, however, it was abolished, leaving No. 1 uniform as the most formal order of dress. Subsequently, in 1960, full dress uniform was reintroduced in the form of [[Royal Navy uniform#Ceremonial Day Dress|Ceremonial Day Dress]]. Worn only by limited categories of senior officers this is very similar to the old full dress, but without fringed epaulettes and slashes, and worn with a peaked cap.\n\n====Civilian organisations====\nThe formal uniforms used by police forces were until the late 20th century mostly the same as the uniforms worn on ordinary duties but sometimes with various embellishments. The introduction of newer uniforms deliberately designed as workwear has left the older styles mainly used for ceremonial or formal purposes. The general formal style is a black jacket and trousers with a white shirt and a [[custodian helmet]] or peaked cap. A particular variation is that used by mounted police in Merseyside which can be observed when they escort the winner of the annual Grand National horse race at Aintree; this consists of the traditional ''Custodian helmet'' with an added white plume and silvered chinstrap; along with the style of tunic it bears more resemblance to a late 19th/early 20th century police uniform.\n\n=== United States ===\n====U.S. Air Force====\n{{Further|Uniforms of the United States Air Force}}\nIn the mid-1980s, \"ceremonial blue\" uniform and \"ceremonial white\" uniform were introduced in the [[United States Air Force]].

Depending on the occasion, officers may also wear [[sword]]s with either Full Dress White or Blue. Both the white and blue uniforms are worn with the distinctive peaked cap with white cover.\n\nNaval enlisted personnel ranked [[Petty Officer First Class]], E-6, and below also have seasonal uniforms. The dress white and blue uniforms are both of the traditional \"[[sailor suit]]\" or [[Cracker Jack|crackerjack]] type for men, and women wear the same as summertime dress white uniform. It consists of a pullover shirt, called a [[Sweater|jumper]], with a V-neck going to a square collar flap, a black [[neckerchief]], and bell-bottomed trousers. The white uniform is worn with a white belt and silver buckle, and the sleeves come down to the middle of the hand. The blue uniform features the thirteen button trousers, and has three rows of white piping on the collar and cuffs. Women wear a uniform similar to female officers and Chiefs, but with silver buttons, and a cover device with a spread eagle and \"USN\".\n\n====U.S. Coast Guard====\nBefore 1972, U.S. Coast Guard personnel generally wore the same uniforms as the U.S. Navy but with distinctive Coast Guard insignia, primarily distinctive cap devices for officers and chief petty officers, incorporation of the Coast Guard shield in lieu of line or staff corps insignia for officers, and differentiated uniform buttons on dress uniforms.\n[[File:Coast Guard Full Dress Blue uniform.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[United States Coast Guard]] in Full Dress Blue during a change of command ceremony at [[Coast Guard Base Kodiak]].]]\nPresently, the U.S. Coast Guard maintains two full dress uniforms, full dress blue, and full dress white.<ref name=uscg/> Full dress blue is worn during change of command ceremonies, parades, and reviews when special honours are being paid, including state visits.<ref name=uscg/> The full dress blue uniforms are similar to the U.S. Coast Guard's service dress blue \"Alpha,\" except that it is worn with a full-size medals instead of ribbons. Additionally, a sword may be prescribed for officers, and a white belt and glove may be required.\n\nFull Dress White is worn for similar occasions by officers of the U.S. Coast Guard during the summer, or when in tropical environments.<ref name=uscg/> The Dress White uniform is slightly different depending on the gender; with men wearing a high stand-collared white tunic, white trousers, and white shoes, while women wear a uniform similar to the dress blue uniform but with a white coat and skirt or trousers. Both genders wear shoulder boards rather than sleeve stripes, as well as medals, combination cover, and sword. The uniform is nearly identical to the U.S. Navy's Full Dress Whites, but the buttons and combination cover device are Coast Guard specific.\n\nThe [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] maintains two different styles of parade dress uniforms. Both variants include a black blouse, with banded collars and double row of buttons, and a white peaked hat. However, Full Dress Blue A, uses white trousers, whereas Full Dress Blue B uses black trousers.\n\n=== Venezuela ===\nWithin the [[National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela]] dress uniforms are commonplace within its services.\n\nThe Presidential Honor Guard Brigade wears dress uniforms similar to those used by the Hussar troop raised by Simon Bolivar in 1816. It is of a red tunic with gold buttons and black pants, belt and a black (formerly brown) busby hat, plus epaulettes worn by officers. The Caracas Battalion of the Ministry of Defence wears a light blue uniform with white buttons, black pants, a belt, boots or black shoes and the red beret while the Daniel O'Leary Battalion of the Army Headquarters wears an identical uniform but with the dark blue beret.\n\n==Full dress uniform by non-directly military organisations==\n===St John Ambulance===\n{{further|Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)}}\n[[File:SJAM Parade1.jpg|thumb|Individuals leading a group of [[St John Ambulance of Malaysia]] (SJAM) volunteers wearing SJAM's ceremonial uniform.]]\n[[St John Ambulance]] is a volunteer group of affiliated organisations in 42 countries, which aims to teach and provide [[first aid]], and [[emergency medical services]]. The organisation uses a number of uniforms, including a ceremonial one. The affiliated national organisations do not share a standardized ceremonial uniform, known as formal uniform or dress uniform depending on the country.\n\nThe uniform of St John Ambulance in [[St. John Ambulance Canada|Canada]], [[St John Ambulance in England|England]], [[St John Ambulance Ireland|Ireland]], and [[St John Ambulance in Wales|Wales]] was derived from the uniforms of London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]]; using similar jackets and trousers with different buttons, badges, and a cap with a white band and belt-mounted items relevant to first-aid work. Conversely, the ceremonial uniform for St John Ambulance in [[St John Ambulance of Malaysia|Malaysia]], and [[St John Singapore]] uses a white tunic and black trousers; derived from the British Army's warm weather ceremonial uniform. Generally, the organisation's ceremonial uniform is not used for daily medical and first-aid work, with the various national St John Ambulance organisations issuing a variety of occupational uniforms.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Military uniform]]\n**[[Mess dress uniform]]\n**[[Service dress uniform]]\n**[[Combat uniform]]\n* [[Formal wear]]\n** [[Morning dress]]\n** [[White tie]]\n** [[Ceremonial dress]]\n** [[Religious clothing]]\n** [[Folk costume]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline|Full dress uniforms}}\n\n{{Clothing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dress Uniform}}\n[[Category:Military uniforms]]\n[[Category:Formal wear]]\n[[Category:Uniforms]]\n", "name_user": "RedRumRomanus", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_dress_uniform"}

{"title_page": "Agenda-setting theory", "text_new": "{{Essay-like|date=August 2019}}\n\n'''Agenda-setting theory''' describes the \"ability (of the [[news media]]) to influence the importance placed on the topics of the public agenda\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M|author2=Reynolds, A|title=News influence on our pictures of the world|journal=Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research|year=2002}}</ref> Agenda-setting theory was formally developed by Max McCombs and [[Donald Lewis Shaw|Donald Shaw]] in a study on the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 American presidential election]]. Agenda setting is a social science theory; it also attempts to make predictions. The theory also suggests that media has a great influence to their audience by instilling what they should think instead of what they think. That is, if a news item is covered frequently and prominently, the audience will regard the issue as more important.  \n\nAgenda-setting is the creation of public awareness and concern of salient issues by the news media. As well, agenda-setting describes the way that media attempts to influence viewers, and establish a hierarchy of news prevalence. Two basic assumptions underlie most researches on agenda-setting: \n\n# the press and the media do not reflect reality; they filter and shape it;\n# media concentration on a few issues and subjects leads the public to perceive those issues as more important than other issues.\n\nThese core statements were established by measuring the changes in salience through the use of surveys with the presence of more frequent news coverage.<ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\" /><ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\" />\n\nOne of the most critical aspects in the concept of an agenda-setting role of [[mass communication]] is the time frame for this phenomenon. Different media have different agenda-setting potential. From the perspective of agenda setting, the analysis of the relationship between traditional media and new virtual spaces has witnessed growing momentum.<ref>ARUGUETE, N. (2017). The agenda setting hypothesis in the new media environment. Comunicaci\u00f3n Y Sociedad (0188-252X), (28), 35-58.</ref>\n\nIn the 1968 \"Chapel Hill study\", McCombs and [[Donald Lewis Shaw|Shaw]] demonstrated a strong [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]] (r > .9) between what 100 residents of [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]] thought was the most important election issue and what the local and national news media reported was the most important issue.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M|author2=Shaw, D|title=The agenda-setting function of mass media|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1972|volume=36|issue=2|doi=10.1086/267990|pages=176|url=http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/ESMP/article/view/62207}}</ref> By comparing the salience of issues in news content with the public's perceptions of the most important election issue, McCombs and [[Donald Lewis Shaw|Shaw]] were able to determine the degree to which the media determines [[public opinion]]. Since the 1968 study, published in a 1972 edition of ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]'', more than 400 studies have been published on the agenda-setting function of the [[mass media]], and the theory continues to be regarded as relevant.\nStudies have shown that what the media decides to expose in certain countries correlates with their views on things such as politics, economy and culture. Countries that tend to have more political power are more likely to receive media exposure. Financial resources, technologies, foreign trade and money spent on the military can be some of the main factors that explain coverage inequality.<ref name=\"McCombs 2005\">{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M|title=A look at agenda-setting: Past, present and future.|journal=Journalism Studies|year=2005|volume=6|issue=4|doi=10.1080/14616700500250438|pages=543\u2013557}}</ref>\n\nAgenda-setting can be traced to the first chapter of [[Walter Lippmann]]'s 1922 book, ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lippmann|first=W|title=Public opinion|url=https://archive.org/details/publicopinion00lippgoog|year=1922|publisher=Harcourt|location=New York}}</ref>  In that chapter, \"[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/lippman/ch01.html The World Outside And The Pictures In Our Heads]\", Lippmann argues that the mass media are the principal connection between events in the world and the images in the minds of the public. Without using the term \"agenda-setting\", Walter Lippmann was writing about what we today would call \"agenda-setting\". Following Lippmann, in 1963, [[Bernard Cecil Cohen|Bernard Cohen]] observed that the press \"may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about. The world will look different to different people,\" Cohen continues, \"depending on the map that is drawn for them by writers, editors, and publishers of the paper they read.\"<ref name=\"Cohen 1963\">{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=B|title=The press and foreign policy|year=1963|publisher=Harcourt|location=New York}}</ref> As early as the 1960s, Cohen had expressed the idea that later led to formalization of agenda-setting theory by McCombs and Shaw. The stories with the strongest agenda setting influence tend to be those that involve conflict, terrorism, crime and drug issues within the United States. Those that don't include or involve the United State and politics associate negatively with public opinion. In turn, there is less concern.\n\nAlthough Maxwell McCombs already had some interest in the field, he was exposed to Cohen's work while serving as a faculty member at [[UCLA]], and it was Cohen's work that heavily influenced him, and later Donald Shaw.<ref name=\"Rogers 1993 68\u201384\">{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=E|title=The anatomy of agenda-setting research|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=2|pages=68\u201384|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01263.x}}</ref> The concept of agenda setting was launched by McCombs and Shaw during the 1968 presidential election in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. They examined Lippmann's idea of construction of the pictures in our heads by comparing the issues on the media agenda with key issues on the undecided voters' agenda. They found evidence of agenda setting by identifying that salience of the news agenda is highly correlated to that of the voters' agenda. McCombs and Shaw were the first to provide the field of communication with empirical evidence that demonstrated the power of mass media and its influence on the public agenda. The empirical evidence also earned this theory its credibility amongst other social scientific theories.<ref name=\"Rogers 1993 68\u201384\" /><ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\" />\n\nA relatively unknown scholar named G. Ray Funkhouser performed a study highly similar to McCombs and Shaw's around the same time the authors were formalizing the theory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Funkhouser|first=G|title=The issues of the sixties: An exploratory study in the dynamics of public opinion|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1973|volume=37|issue=1|pages=62\u201375|doi=10.1086/268060}}</ref>  All three scholars \u2013 McCombs, Shaw, and Funkhouser \u2013 even presented their findings at the same academic conference. Funkhouser's article was published later than McCombs and Shaw's, and Funkhouser doesn't receive as much credit as McCombs and Shaw for discovering agenda setting. According to Everett Rogers, there are two main reasons for this.<ref name=\"Rogers 1993 68\u201384\"/> First, Funkhouser didn't formally name the theory. Second, Funkhouser didn't pursue his research much past the initial article. Rogers also suggests that Funkhouser was geographically isolated at [[Stanford]], cut off from interested researchers, whereas McCombs and Shaw had got other people interested in agenda setting research.\n\n==Type==\nThe research on the effect of agenda setting compares the salience of issues in news content with the public perceptions of the most important issue, and then analyses the extent of influence by guidance of the media. There are three models assumed by Max McCombs: the awareness model, the priorities model and the salience model. Most investigations are centered on these three models. In the research, the dependent variables are media agenda, audience agenda and policy agenda as listed in the following part. Rogers and Dearing identify three types of agenda setting:<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\"/>\n\n#public agenda setting, in which the public's agenda is the [[Dependent and independent variables#Dependent variable|dependent variable]] (the traditional hypothesis)\n#media agenda setting, in which the media's agenda is treated as the dependent variable (\"agenda building\")\n#policy agenda setting, in which elite policy makers' agendas are treated as the dependent variable (\"political agenda setting\")\n\nMass communication research, Rogers and Dearing argue, has focused a great deal on public agenda setting (e.g. McCombs and Shaw, 1972) and media agenda setting, but has largely ignored [[overton window|policy agenda setting]], which is studied primarily by [[political science|political scientists]]. As such, the authors suggest mass communication scholars pay more attention to how the media and public agendas might influence elite policy maker's agendas (i.e. scholars should ask where the President or members of the U.S. Congress get their news from and how this affects their policies). Writing in 2006, Walgrave and Van Aelst took up Rogers and Dearing's suggestions, creating a preliminary theory of political agenda setting, which examines factors that might influence elite policy makers' agendas.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walgrave|first=S|author2=Van Aelst, P|title=The contingency of the mass media's political agenda setting power: Toward a preliminary theory|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2006|volume=56|pages=88\u2013109|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00005.x}}</ref>\n\n==Accessibility==\nAgenda setting occurs through a cognitive process known as \"accessibility\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Iyengar|first=S|title=News that mattes: Television and American opinion|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|author2=Kinder, D}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Iyengar|first=S|title=The accessibility bias in politics: Television news and public opinion|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=1990|volume=2|pages=1\u201315|doi=10.1093/ijpor/2.1.1}}</ref> Accessibility implies that the more frequently and prominently the news media cover an issue, the more instances of that issue become accessible in audience's memories. When respondents are asked what the most important problem facing the country is, they answer with the most accessible news issue in memory, which is typically the issue the news media focused on the most. The agenda-setting effect is not the result of receiving one or a few messages but is due to the aggregate impact of a very large number of messages, each of which has a different content but all of which deal with the same general issue.<ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\">{{cite journal|last=Dearing|first=J|title=Agenda-setting research: Where has it been, where is it going?|journal=Communication Yearbook|year=1988|volume=11|pages=555\u2013594|author2=Rogers, E}}</ref> \nMass-media coverage in general and agenda-setting in particular also has a powerful impact on what individuals think that other people are thinking,<ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Noelle-Neumann|first=E|title=Turbulances in the climate of opinion:Methodological applications of the spiral of silence theory|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1977|volume=41 | issue = 2|pages=143\u2013158|doi = 10.1086/268371 }}</ref> and hence they tend to allocate more importance to issues that have been extensively covered by mass media. This is also called [[Schema (psychology)|schemata theory]]. In psychology and cognitive science, a schema (plural schemata or schemas) describes a pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories of information and the relationships among them.\n\n==Comparison to agenda-building==\nAs more scholars published articles on agenda-setting theories it became evident that the process involves not only active role of media organizations, but also participation of the public<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\">{{cite journal|last=Erbring|first=L|author2=Goldenberg, E.N.|author3=Miller, A.H.|title=Front-page news and real-world cues: A new look at agenda-setting by the media.|journal=American Journal of Political Science|year=1980|volume=24|issue=1|pages=16\u201349|doi=10.2307/2110923|jstor=2110923}}</ref><ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\">{{cite journal |last=Lang|first=G.E.|author2=Lang, K.|title=Watergate: An exploration of the agenda-building process|editor=Wilhout, G.C.| editor2=de Bock, H.|journal=Mass Communication Review Yearbook|year=1981|volume=2|pages=447\u2013468}}</ref> as well as policymakers.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\">{{cite journal|last=Berkowitz|first=D|title=Who sets the media agenda?

The media agenda in fact is the result of the influences that certain powerful groups exert as a subtle form of social control. Journalists have limited time and limited resources that can contribute to external sources getting involved in the news media's gatekeeping process, and some scholars have attempted to reveal certain relationships between information sources and the agenda the news media has made up, probing who builds the media agenda. There are multiple sources that can participate in this agenda-building process through various different ways, but researchers have been the most interested in the effectiveness of information aids such as media kits and press releases within the news media agenda, and this is a measure of the success of organizations public relations efforts.\n\nBerkowitz has implemented a more nuanced analysis of agenda-setting and agenda-building theories by introducing the terms policy agenda-setting and policy agenda-building.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/> He argues that when scholars investigate only the linkage between media and policymakers, it is still appropriate to use the notion of policy agenda-setting.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/> However, when the focus is placed not only on policymakers' personal agendas, but also on the broader salient issues where media represent only one indicator of public sentiment, Berkowitz suggests talking about policy agenda-building.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/>\n\n== Research on policymakers and public ==\n\n=== Role of policymakers in agenda-setting process ===\nSome groups have a greater ease of access than others and are thus more likely to get their demands placed on agenda than others.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\">{{cite journal|last=Cobb|first=R.W.|author2=Elder, C.|title=The politics of agenda-building: An alternative perspective for modern democratic theory|journal=Journal of Politics|year=1971|volume=33|issue=4|pages=892\u2013915|doi=10.2307/2128415|jstor=2128415|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e47bf34ab7ec85bfc5e0ace18859a5b015c9f347}}</ref>  For instance, policymakers have been found to be more influential than the overall group of news sources because they often better understand journalists' needs for reliable and predictable information and their definition of newsworthiness.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/> Cobb and Elder ascribed even more importance to decision makers, claiming that in order for an issue to attain agenda status, it must be supported by at least some of key decision makers as they act as guardians of the formal agenda.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\"/>  They also asserted that certain personages in the media can act as opinion leaders and bring media coverage to a particular issue.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\"/> Government-affiliated news sources have higher success rates in becoming media agenda and have been found by a number of scholars to be the most frequently appearing of sources at the local, state, and national levels.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/>\n\nNews sources can also provide definitions of issues, thus determining the terms of future discussion and framing problems in particular ways.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/><ref name=\"Hilgarten 1988 53\u201378\">{{cite journal|last=Hilgarten|first=S|author2=Bosk, C.L.|title=The rise and fall of social problems: A public arenas model|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=1988|volume=94|pages=53\u201378|doi=10.1086/228951}}</ref>  What interpretation of \"reality\" will dominate public discourse has implications for the future of the social problem, for the interest groups and policymakers involved, and for the policy itself.<ref name=\"Hilgarten 1988 53\u201378\"/>  For example, Gusfield argues that the highway deaths associated with alcohol consumption can be interpreted as a problem of irresponsible drunken drivers, insufficient automobile [[crashworthiness]], a transportation system overly dependent on cars, poor highway design, excessive emphasis on drinking in adult social life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gusfield|first=J.R.|title=The culture of public problems|url=https://archive.org/details/cultureofpublicp00gusf|url-access=registration|year=1981|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref> Different ways of framing the situation may compete to be accepted as an authoritative version of reality,<ref name=\"Hilgarten 1988 53\u201378\"/> consequently spurring competition between sources of information for definition of an issue.

Thus according to Cobb and Elder, the agenda-building framework makes allowances for continuing mass involvement and broaden the range of recognized influences on the public policy-making process.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\"/> Although the public does have a place on the list of possibly influencing the media agenda, they are not thought to powerfully shape media agendas. It seems the more correct to argue the possibility that when journalists look to their own interests for story ideas, they are actually trying to predict their audience's needs.\n\nThis idea of mass involvement has become more prominent with the advent of the Internet and its potential to make everyone a pamphleteer.<ref name=\"Benkler\"/> Increase in the role of citizens in agenda setting sheds light on a new direction in the traditional agenda-building research. This is now the case because the general public can now create their own media. Social media has changed the way people view and perceive things in today's world. Mass involvement within social media lets the general publics voices be heard. Comments and reply's give potential for people to address your thoughts or open new doors for conversation.\n\nKim and Lee<ref name=\"Kim\"/> noted that the agenda-setting research on the Internet differs from traditional agenda-setting research with respect that the Internet is in competition with traditional media and has enormous capacity for contents' and users' interactivity.

Scholars found that a person's opinion could be disseminated through various online channels and could synthesize public opinion that influences news coverage. Their study suggests 'reversed agenda effects', meaning that public agenda could set media agenda. Maxwell McCombs<ref>{{cite book|last=McCombs|first=Maxwell|title=Setting the Agenda: The Mass Media and Public Opinion|url=https://archive.org/details/settingagendamas0000mcco/page/198|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Pub|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-7456-2313-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/settingagendamas0000mcco/page/198 198]|edition=Repr.}}</ref> also mentioned \"reverse agenda-setting\" in his recent textbook as a situation where public concern sets the media agenda.\n\nAccording to Kim and Lee,<ref name=\"Kim\"/> agenda-building through the Internet take the following three steps: 1) Internet-mediated agenda-rippling: an anonymous netizen's opinion spreads to the important agenda in the Internet through online main rippling channels such as blogs, personal homepages, and the Internet bulletin boards. 2) agenda diffusion in the Internet: online news or web-sites report the important agenda in the Internet that in turn leads to spreading the agenda to more online publics. 3) Internet-mediated reversed agenda-setting: traditional media report online agenda to the public so that the agenda spread to both offline and online publics. However, scholars concluded that the Internet-mediated agenda-setting or agenda-building processes not always occur in consecutive order. For example, the agenda that was reported by traditional media can come to the fore again through the online discussion or the three steps can occur simultaneously in a short period of time.\n\nSeveral studies provide evidence that the Internet-community, particularly bloggers, can push their own agenda into public agenda, then media agenda, and, eventually, into policy agenda. In the most comprehensive study to date, Wallsten<ref>Wallsten, Kevin (2007). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00300.x/abstract;jsessionid=28AD554C0CBC1E693100AB5BF7818290.f02t04?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false Agenda setting and the blogosphere: An analysis of the relationship between mainstream media and political blogs], [[Review of Policy Research]].</ref> tracked mainstream media coverage and blog discussion of 35 issues during the 2004 presidential campaign. Using [[time-series analysis]], Wallsten found evidence that journalists discuss the issues that bloggers are blogging about. There are also anecdotal pieces of evidence suggesting bloggers exert an influence on the political agenda. For instance, in 2005 Eason Jordan, the chief news executive at CNN, abruptly resigned after being besieged by the online community after saying, according to various witnesses, that he believed the United States military had aimed at journalists in Iraq and killed 12 of them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Seelye|first=K.Q.|title=Resignation at CNN shows the growing influence of blogs|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/14/technology/14cnn.html |accessdate=30 October 2014|work=The New York Times|date=14 February 2005}}</ref> Similarly, in 2002, [[Trent Lott]] had to resign as [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate majority leader]] due to his inappropriate racist remarks that were widely discussed in the blogosphere.<ref name=\"Benkler\">{{cite book|last=Benkler|first=Y|title=The wealth of networks: How Social production transforms markets and freedom|url=https://archive.org/details/wealthofnetworks00benk|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT}}</ref> However bloggers attract attention not only to oust journalists and politicians. An online investigation on technical problems with electronic voting machines started by an activist Bev Harris in 2003 eventually forced traditional media outlets to address issue of electronic voting malperformance. This in turn made Diebold, a company that produces these machines, to acknowledge its fault and take measures to fix it. Many studies have been performed to test the agenda setting theory within global news coverage. One of the findings determined that foreign news that had any mentions of the United States or the UK, greatly influenced public opinion compared to global news that didn't involve either country.\n\n<ref name=\"Benkler\"/>\n\n==Contingency factors==\n{{see also|contingency factors}}\n===Issue obtrusiveness===\nIn an attempt to overcome mirror-image effects of agenda-setting that implied direct influence of media agenda on the audience, several scholars proposed that the model of agenda-setting should include individual/collective audience characteristics or real-world conditions that are likely to affect issue importance. They discovered that certain individual and group characteristics are likely to act as contingent conditions of [[media impact]] and proposed a model of \"audience effects\".<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\" />\n\nAccording to the audience-effects model, [[media coverage]] interacts with the audience's pre-existing sensitivities to produce changes in issue concerns. Thus, media effects are contingent on issue-specific audience characteristics.<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\" /> For instance, for high-sensitivity audiences who are most affected by a certain issue or a problem, the salience of this issue increases substantially with news exposure, while the same exposure has little effect on other groups. Erbring, Goldenberg and Miller have also demonstrated that people who do not talk about political issues are more subject to agenda-setting influence because they depend more heavily on media content than those who receive information from other sources, including their colleagues and friends.<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\" />\n\nAnother factor that causes variations in the [[correlation]] between the media and public agenda is whether an issue is \"obtrusive\" or \"unobtrusive\";<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\" /> i.e., whether it has a high or low issue threshold.<ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\" /> Obtrusive or issues with low threshold are generally the ones that affect nearly everyone and with which we can have some kind of personal experience (e.g. citywide crime or increases in [[Gasoline and diesel usage and pricing|gasoline prices]]). Because of their link to personal concerns, these issues almost compel attention from [[political elite]]s as well as the news media. Moreover, with this type of issues the problem would be of general concern even without attention from the news media.<ref name=\"Lang\">{{cite journal|last=Lang|first=G.E.|author2=Lang, K.|title=Watergate: An exploration of the agenda-building process|editor=Wilhout, G.C.| editor2=de Bock, H.|journal=Mass Communication Review Yearbook|year=1981|volume=2|pages=447\u2013468}}</ref>\n\nUnobtrusive or high threshold issues are those issues that are generally remote from just about everyone (e.g., high-level wrongdoing, such as the [[Watergate scandal]]; plight of [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]]). Research performed by Zucker suggests that an issue is obtrusive if most members of the public have had direct contact with it, and less obtrusive if audience members have not had direct experience. This means that the less direct experience people have with an issue, the greater is the news media's influence on public opinion on that issue.<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\" /><ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Zucker|first=H|title=The variable nature of news media influence.|journal=Communication Yearbook|year=1978|volume=2|pages=225\u2013246}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, unobtrusive or high-threshold issues do not pertain into media agenda as quickly as obtrusive issues and therefore require a buildup, which is a function of more than the amount of space or time the media devote to the story. The latter may push the story past the threshold of inattention, but it is also important to look at the kind of coverage to explain how a certain incident becomes an issue.<ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\" />\n\n===Need for orientation===\nAgenda-setting studies typically show variability in the correlation between media and public agenda. To explain differences in the correlation, McCombs and colleagues created the concept of \"need for orientation\", which \"describes individual differences in the desire for orienting cues and background information\".\n\nTwo concepts: [[relevance]] and [[uncertainty]], define an individual's need for orientation. Relevance suggests that an individual will not seek news media information if an issue is not personally relevant. Hence, if relevance is low, people will feel the need for less orientation. There are many issues in our country that are just not relevant to people, because they do not affect us. Many news organizations attempt to frame issues in a way that attempts to make them relevant to its audiences. This is their way of keeping their viewership/readership high. \"Level of uncertainty is the second defining condition of need for orientation. Frequently, individuals already have all the information that they desire about a topic. Their degree of uncertainty is low.\"<ref>Mccombs, (2004) p. 55</ref> When issues are of high personal relevance and uncertainty low, the need to monitor any changes in those issues will be present and there will be a moderate the need for orientation. If at any point in time viewers/readers have high relevance and high uncertainty about any type of issue/event/election campaign there was a high need for orientation.\n\nDavid Weaver (1977)<ref name=\"Weaver, D. H.\">{{cite book|last=al.]|first=Donald L. Shaw, Maxwell E. McCombs ; in association with Lee B. Becker ...

Research done by Weaver in 1977 suggested that individuals vary on their need for orientation. Need for orientation is a combination of the individual's interest in the topic and uncertainty about the issue. The higher levels of interest and uncertainty produce higher levels of need for orientation. So the individual would be considerably likely to be influenced by the [[news media|media]] stories (psychological aspect of theory).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weaver|first=D|title=Political issues and voter need for orientation|journal=In D.L.

Each of the objects on an agenda has a lot of attributes containing cognitive components such as information that describes characteristics of the object, and an affective component including tones (positive, negative, neutral) of the characteristics on agenda. The agenda setting theory and the second level of agenda setting, framing, are both relevant and similar in demonstrating how society is influenced by media, but they describe a different process of influence. One tells us what information to process and the other tells us how to process that information. Framing theory, an extension of agenda setting, describes how the \"stance\" an article of media may take can affect the perception of the viewer. It is said that there are two main attributes of the second-level of agenda setting. Those include substantive and affective. The substantive factor has to do mainly with things such as personality and ideology. The affective factor is focused on the positive, negative, and neutral side of things.\n\n==== Second-level agenda-setting vs. framing ====\nMcCombs et al. (1997)<ref name=\"McCombs et al 1997\">{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M. E.|author2=Llamas, J. P. |author3= Lopez-Escobar, E. |author4= Rey, F.|title=Candidate's images in Spanish elections: Second-level agenda-setting effects|journal=Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|year=1997|volume=74|issue=4|pages=703\u2013717|doi=10.1177/107769909707400404}}[http://www.aejmc.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Journalism-Mass-Communication-Quarterly1997-McCombs-703-17.pdf Pdf.]</ref> demonstrated that agenda-setting research at the second level deals with the influence of 'attribute' salience, whereas the first level agenda-setting illustrates the influence of 'issue' salience. Balmas and Sheafer (2010)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Balmas|first=M|author2=Sheafer, T|title=Candidate Image in Election Campaigns: Attribute Agenda Setting, Affective Priming, and Voting Intentions|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|date=June 2010|volume=22|issue=2|pages=204\u2013229|doi=10.1093/ijpor/edq009}}</ref>  argued that the focus at the first level agenda-setting which emphasizes media's role in telling us \"what to think about\" is shifted to media's function of telling us \"how to think about\" at the second level agenda-setting. The second level of agenda-setting considers how the agenda of attributes affects public opinion (McCombs & Evatt, 1995). Furthermore, Ghanem(1997)<ref name=\"Ghanem, S.\">{{cite book|last=Weaver|first=ed. by Maxwell McCombs, Donald L. Shaw, David|title=Communication and democracy : exploring the intellectual frontiers in agenda-setting theory|year=1997|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, N.J.|isbn=978-0-8058-2555-8|edition=[Nachdr.].}}</ref>  demonstrated that the certain attributes agendas in the news with low psychological distance, drove compelling arguments for the salience of public agenda. The second-level agenda-setting differs from traditional agenda-setting in that it focus on attribute salience, and public's attribute agenda is regarded as one of the important variables. An example of framing is when a company releases a statement that sounds a lot better than what it actually is. Acting like it the fine print that people don't see. They \"frame\" it to sound better and more appealing to the public. This can also take place in crisis management, when companies release a statement to save the companies reputation after a crisis occurred. This was very prominent in the BP oil spill several years ago.\n\nOne example that helps illustrate the effects of framing involves president Nixon's involvement in the watergate scandal. According to a study conducted by Lang and Lang, the media coverage at first belittled the watergate scandal and the President's involvement. It wasn't until the story was framed as one of the highest political scandals in US history that the public opinion changed (Lang & Lang, 1981) This event depicts how the media personnel have a great deal of power in persuading the public's opinions. It also suggests that framing is a form of gatekeeping, similar to  the agenda setting theory.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lang & Lang|title=Watergate: An exploration of the agenda-building process.|journal=Mass Communication Review Yearbook|date=1981}}</ref>\n\nThere is a debate over whether [[Framing (social sciences)|framing theory]] should be subsumed within agenda-setting as \"second-level agenda-setting\". McCombs, Shaw, Weaver and colleagues generally argue that framing is a part of agenda-setting that operates as a \"second-level\" or secondary effect. [[Dietram Scheufele]] has argued the opposite. Scheufele argues that framing and agenda-setting possess distinct theoretical boundaries, operate via distinct cognitive processes (accessibility vs. attribution), and relate to different outcomes (perceptions of issue importance vs. interpretation of news issue).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scheufele|first=D|title=Agenda-setting, priming, and framing revisited: Another look at cognitive effects of political communication|journal=Mass Communication & Society|year=2000|volume=3|issue=2|pages=297\u2013316|doi=10.1207/s15327825mcs0323_07}}</ref>\n\nWhen talking about the second-level of agenda setting, as well as the political aspects of the theory, its pivotal to include priming. Priming is considered to be the step past agenda setting, and is also referred to as the last step of the process. Priming is primarily used in political settings. It discusses how the media will choose to leave some issues about the candidates out of coverage, while presenting other issues in the fore front. This process creates different standards by which the public evaluates candidates. As well, by reporting the issues that have the most salience on the public; they are not objectively presenting both candidates equally. \n \nAccording to Weaver,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weaver | first1 = D. H. | year = 2007 | title = Thoughts on Agenda Setting, Framing, and Priming | url = | journal = Journal of Communication | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 142\u2013147 | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00333.x }}</ref> framing and second-level agenda setting have the following characteristics:\n\n'''Similarities:'''\n\n# Both are more concerned with how issues or other objects are depicted in the media than with which issues or objects are more or less prominently reported.\n# Both focus on most salient or prominent aspects of themes or descriptions of the objects of interest.\n# Both are concerned with ways of thinking rather than objects of thinking\n\n'''Differences:'''\n\n# Framing does seem to include a broader range of cognitive processes \u2013 moral evaluations, causal reasoning, appeals to principle, and recommendations for treatment of problems \u2013 than does second-level agenda-setting (the salience of attributes of an object). <br/> Scheufele and Tewksbury argue that \"framing differs significantly from these accessibility-based models [i.e., agenda setting and priming]. It is based on the assumption that how an issue is characterized in news reports can have an influence on how it is understood by audiences;\"<ref name=\"Scheufele, D. A. 2007\"/> the difference between whether we think about an issue and how we think about it. Framing and agenda setting differ in their functions in the process of '''news production''', '''information processing''' and '''media effects'''.\n# '''News production''': Although \"both frame building and agenda building refer to macroscopic mechanisms that deal with message construction rather than media effects\", frame building is more concerned with the news production process than agenda building. In other words, \"how forces and groups in society try to shape public discourse about an issue by establishing predominant labels is of far greater interest from a framing perspective than from a traditional agenda-setting one.\"\n# '''News processing''': For framing and agenda-setting, different conditions seem to be needed in processing messages to produce respective effects. Framing effect is more concerned with audience attention to news messages, while agenda setting is more concerned with repeated exposure to messages.\n# '''Locus of effect''': Agenda-setting effects are determined by the ease with which people can retrieve from their memory issues recently covered by mass media, while framing is the extent to which media messages fit ideas or knowledge people have in their knowledge store.\n\nBased on these shared characteristics, McCombs and colleagues<ref>McCombs, M. E., Shaw, D. L., & Weaver, D. H. (1997). Communication and democracy: Explorining the intellectual frontiers in agenda-setting theory. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.</ref> recently argued that framing effects should be seen as the extension of agenda setting. In other words, according to them, the premise that framing is about selecting \"a restricted number of thematically related attributes\"<ref>McCombs, M. E., Shaw, D. L., & Weaver, D. H. (1997). p. 106</ref>  for media representation can be understood as the process of transferring the salience of issue attributes (i.e., second-level agenda setting). That is, according to McCombs and colleagues' arguments, framing falls under the umbrella of agenda setting.\n\n====Accessibility (agenda-setting) vs. applicability (framing)====\nAccording to Price and Tewksbury,<ref>Price, V., & Tewksbury, D. (1997). News values and public opinion: A theoretical account of media priming and framing. In G. Barnett & F. Boster (Eds.), Progress in communication sciences (pp. 173-212). Norwood, N.J.: Ablex Pub. Corp.</ref> however, agenda-setting and framing are built on different theoretical premises: agenda-setting is based on '''accessibility''', while framing is concerned with '''applicability''' (i.e., the relevance between message features and one's stored ideas or knowledge). Accessibility-based explanation of agenda-setting is also applied to second-level agenda-setting. That is, transferring the salience of issue attributes (i.e., second-level agenda-setting) is a function of accessibility.\n\nFor framing effects, empirical evidence shows that the impact of frames on public perceptions is mainly determined by perceived importance of specific frames rather than by the quickness of retrieving frames.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = T. | last2 = Clawson | first2 = R. | last3 = Oxley | first3 = Z. | year = 1997 | title = Media framing of a civil liberties conflict and its effect on tolerance | url = | journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 91 | issue = 3| pages = 567\u2013583 | doi=10.2307/2952075| jstor = 2952075 }}</ref> That is, the way framing effects transpires is different from the way second-level agenda-setting is supposed to take place (i.e., accessibility). On a related note, Scheufele and Tewksbury<ref name=\"Scheufele, D. A. 2007\">{{cite journal | last1 = Scheufele | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Tewksbury | first2 = D. | year = 2007 | title = Framing, agenda-setting, and priming: The evolution of three media effects models | url = | journal = Journal of Communication | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 9\u201320 }}</ref> argues that, because accessibility and applicability vary in their functions of media effects, \"the distinction between accessibility and applicability effects has obvious benefits for understanding and predicting the effects of dynamic information environments\".\n\nTaken together, it can be concluded that the integration of framing into agenda-setting is either impossible because they are based on different theoretical premises or imprudent because merging the two concepts would result in the loss of our capabilities to explain various media effects.\n\n(a) ''' Accessibility (Agenda-setting)'''\n\nIncreasing attention has been devoted to examining how agenda-setting occur in terms of their psychological mechanisms (Holbrook & Hill, 2005). Price and Tewksbury (1997) argued that agenda-setting effects are based on the accessibility model of information processing. Accessibility can be defined as \"how much\" or \"how recently\" a person has been exposed to certain issues (Kim et al., 2002). Specifically, individuals try to make less cognitive effort in forming social judgments, they are more likely to rely on the information that is easily accessible (Higgins, 1996). This leads to a greater probability that more accessible information will be used when people make judgments on certain issues (Iyeanger & Kinder, 1987; Scheufele & Tewksbury, 2007).\n\nThe concept of accessibility is the foundation of a memory-based model (Scheufele, 2000). It assumes that individuals make judgments on the issues based on information that is easily available and retrievable from their memory (Tulving & Watkins, 1975; Hastie & Park, 1986; Iyengar, 1990). Tversky and Kahneman (1974) also argue that the formation of individuals' judgments directly correlates with \"the ease in which instances or associations could be brought to mind\" (p.&nbsp;208). When individuals receive and process information, they develop memory traces that can be easily recalled to make decisions on a certain issue. Agenda-setting, in this regard, can make certain issue to be easily accessed in individual's memory when forming judgment about the issue.\n\n(b) '''Applicability (Framing)'''\n\nThe idea of framing theory is closely related to the agenda-setting theory tradition but it expands more upon the research by focusing on the substance of certain issues at hand rather than on a particular topic. This means that the framing theory's basis is that of the media focuses its attention on certain events and then places them within a field of meaning.  is the process of selecting certain aspects of an issue to bring people's attention and to lead them a particular line of interpretation (Entman, 1993; Scheufele, 1999). Also, the media's selective uses of certain frames can affect the way the audience thinks about the issue (Oh & Kim, 2010). This may sound similar to attribute agenda-setting. Both seem to examine which attributes or aspects of an issue are emphasized in the media (Kim et al., 2011). Some scholars even argue that framing should be considered as an extension of agenda-setting (McCombs, 1997).\n\nHowever, framing is based on the applicability model, which is conceptually different from the accessibility model used in agenda-setting. According to Goffman (1974), individuals actively classify and interpret their life experiences to make sense of the world around them. These classifications and interpretations then become the individual's pre-existing and long-standing schema. Framing influences how audience thinks about issues, not by making certain aspects more salient than others, but by invoking interpretive cues that correspond to the individuals' pre-existing schema (Scheufele, 2000). Also, framing is when these interpretive cues correspond with or activate individuals' pre-existing cognitive schema (Kim et al., 2002). Applicability, in this regard, refers to finding the connection between the message in the media and the framework individuals employ to interpret the issue (Scheufele & Tewksbury, 2007).\n\nKim and his colleagues (2002) provide distinction between the applicability and accessibility models is important in terms of issue salience. Framing assumes that each individual will have its own interpretation of an issue, regardless of the salience of an issue. Specifically, it focuses on the \"terminological or semantic differences\" of how an issue is described. Agenda-setting, on the other hand, assume that only salient issues in the media will become accessible in people's minds when they evaluate or make judgments on the issue. Taken together, the accessibility of issue salience makes the two models of information processing different (Scheufele, 2000).\n\n==== An emotion dimension ====\nAccording to the theory of affective intelligence, \"emotions enhance citizen rationality\". It argues that emotions, particularly negative ones, are crucial in having people pay attention to politics and help shape their political views.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Affective Intelligence and Political Judgment|last1 = Marcus |first1 = George E. |last2 = Neuman |first2 = W.

Three conclusions are presented:\n* The media's emotional-affective agenda corresponds with the public's emotional impressions of candidates;\n* Negative emotions are more powerful than positive emotions;\n* Agenda-setting effects are greater on the audiences' emotions than on their cognitive assessments of character traits.\n\n=== Agenda setting between media and other sources ===\nRecent research on agenda-setting digs into the question of \"who sets the media agenda\".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application |edition = 5th |last1 = West |first1 = Richard |last2 = Turner |first2 = Lynn H. |publisher = McGraw-Hill Education|year = 2013|location = New York, NY|pages = 377\u2013378 }}</ref>\n\n==== Power relations between media and other sources ====\nLittlejohn and Foss (2011)<ref>{{Cite book|title = Theories of Human Communication|edition = 10th |last1 = Littlejohn |first1 = Stephen W. |last2 = Foss |first2 = Karen A. |publisher = Waveland Press, Inc.|year = 2010|location = Long Grove, IL }}</ref> suggest that there are four types of power relations between media and other sources:\n* High-power source & high-power media: both are equals in setting the agenda\n* High-power source & low-power media: the source sets the agenda for the media\n* Low-power source & high-power media: the media set their own agenda and may marginalize the source\n* Low-power source & low-power media: both are too weak to set the public agenda\n\n==== Intermedia agenda setting ====\nNews organizations affect one another's agendas.

These publications have a direct effect on local newspapers and television networks that are viewed on a less elite scale.\n\nWebsite networks favor other websites that tend to have a higher viewing and SEO. This type of relationship is known as Power Law which allows the media to have a stronger effect on agenda setting. \"Furthermore, the \"birds of a feather\" argument suggests that because news now exists in a network of connected websites, elite and other types of news media are now more motivated to behave similarly.\"\n\n=== Third-level agenda-setting: network agenda setting model ===\nThe most recent agenda-setting studies explore \"the extent to which the news media can transfer the salience of relationships among a set of elements to the public\".<ref>{{Cite journal|title = New Directions in Agenda-Setting Theory and Research |last1 = McCombs |first1 = Maxwell E. |last2 = Shaw |first2 = Donald L. |last3 = Weaver |first3 = David H. |date = November 2014 |journal = Mass Communication & Society | pages = 781\u2013802 |doi=10.1080/15205436.2014.964871 |volume=17|issue = 6 }}</ref> That is, researchers assume that the media can not only influence the salience of certain topics in public agenda, but they can also influence how the public relate these topics to one another.

This model shows that \"the news media can bundle sets of objects or attributes and make these bundles of elements salient in the public's mind simultaneously\". In other words, elements in people's mind are not linear as traditional approaches indicate; instead, they are interconnected with each other to make a network-like structure in one's mind; and if the news media always mention two elements together, the audience will \"perceive these two elements as interconnected\".\n\n==Application==\n===Twitter application===\nOver the last few years, the increase in social media use has had a direct effect on political campaign strategy, particularly on the Social Media platform Twitter. Its unique platform allows users to showcase their political opinion without functioning two directions. It is currently being viewed as a platform for political advancement. Before the use of Twitter, political candidates were using blogs and websites to portray their message and to gain more attention and popularity among their followers. Some of the most followed users on Twitter are past and current Presidents of the United States and other political figures. In terms of retweets, politicians and political parties have been labeled \"influentials\" on Twitter. Twitter is being used as a resource to gather information, reach a larger audience and engagement, stay up to date with current social and political issues, and to achieve the agenda building role. Twitter helps express public opinion which in turn allows a relationship to form between the media and the public. Some may argue that Twitter is still being used as a place for people to follow celebrity news and the culture of Hollywood more than it is being used for important issues and world news. Some may also argue that Twitter does not have the ability to set an agenda as much as conventional news outlets. A 2015 study found a positive correlation between issue ranks in news coverage and issue ranks in Twitter feeds, suggesting that Twitter and conventional news outlets by and large reflected each other.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Conway|first1=Bethany A.|last2=Kenski|first2=Kate|last3=Wang|first3=Di|title=The Rise of Twitter in the Political Campaign: Searching for Intermedia Agenda-Setting Effects in the Presidential Primary|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=July 2015|volume=20|issue=4|pages=363\u2013380|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12124}}</ref> The influence of Twitter may not always seem direct and can change during different phases.\n\n===Non-political application===\nMcCombs and Shaw originally established agenda-setting within the context of a presidential election. Many subsequent studies have looked at agenda setting in the context of an election or in otherwise political contexts. However, more recently scholars have been studying agenda setting in the context of brand community. A brand is defined as what resides in the minds of individuals about a product or service. Brand community is described as a \"specialized, non-geographically bound community based on a structured set of social relations among admirers of a brand.<ref name=Ragas>{{cite journal|last=Ragas|first=Matthew|author2=Marilyn Roberts|title=Agenda Setting and Agenda Melding in an Age of Horizontal and Vertical Media: A New Theoretical Lens for Virtual Brand Communities|journal=Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2009|volume=86|issue=1|pages=45\u201364|issn=1077-6990|doi=10.1177/107769900908600104}}</ref>\" Under these definitions more than just material products can qualify as a brand, political candidates or even celebrities could be viewed as a brand as well.

The central theoretical idea of agenda-setting theory fits well in the world of business communication as well as political communication setting. \"In the case of corporate reputations, only the operational definitions of the objects and attributes on these agendas are changed to frame five key theoretical propositions about the influence of news coverage on corporate reputations among the public. This presentation of five basic propositions offers a theoretical roadmap for systematic empirical research into the influence of the mass media on corporate reputations\"<ref>Carroll, Craig E., and Maxwell McCombs. \"Agenda-setting effects of business news on the public's images and opinions about major corporations.\" Corporate reputation review 6.1 (2003): 36-46</ref>\n* '''Agenda-setting in [[advertising]]'''.

Although agenda-setting theory is related to mass communication theory, it can be applied to [[interpersonal communication]] as well. Yang and Stone investigated people who prefer to interpersonal communication have the same agenda as others who rely on mass media.

The theory has not been limited to elections, and many scholars constantly explored the agenda-setting effect in a variety of communication situations. This explains that agenda-setting has a theoretical value which is able to synthesize social phenomena and to build new research questions.\n\nAnother contribution of agenda-setting is to show the power of media. Since the study of [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]] in [[Erie County, Ohio]], by Paul Lazarsfeld and his colleagues, little evidence of mass communication effects was found over the next twenty years. In 1960, Joseph Klapper's ''Effects of Mass Communication'' also declared the limited effect of media. Agenda-setting caused a paradigm shift in the study of media effects from persuading to informing by its connection of media content and its effects on the public.\n\n==Future==\n\n=== Advent of the Internet ===\nThe advent of the Internet and social networks give rise to a variety of opinions concerning agenda-setting effects online. Some have claimed that the power of traditional media has been weakened.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Meraz | first1 = Sharon | year = 2011 | title = The fight for 'how to think': Traditional media, social networks, and issue interpretation | url = | journal = Journalism | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 107\u2013127 | doi=10.1177/1464884910385193}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wallsten | first1 = Kevin | year = 2007 | title = Agenda setting and the blogosphere: An analysis of the relationship between mainstream media and political blogs | url = | journal = Review of Policy Research | volume = 24 | issue = 6| pages = 567\u2013587 | doi=10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00300.x}}</ref> Others think that the agenda-setting process and its role have continued on the Internet, specifically in electronic bulletin boards.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Marilyn | last2 = Wanta | first2 = Wayne | last3 = Dustin Dzwo | first3 = Tzong-Horng | year = 2002 | title = Agenda setting and issue salience online | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 452\u2013465 | doi=10.1177/0093650202029004004}}</ref> With the presence of rapid mass communication, like social media, the agenda setting theory is both supported and challenged to evolve. Some suggest that social media and traditional media in political campaigns will integrate. Social media is the next step of agenda setting because now popular Twitter handles can now choose what they want their followers to see. While some theorize that the rise of social media will bring a downfall to journalists ability to set the agenda, there is considerable scholarship to counterbalance this form of thinking.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Ryan J|date=2017-02-12|title=Book Review: Jeffrey C Alexander, Elizabeth Butler Breese and Mar\u00eda Luengo (eds) The crisis of journalism reconsidered: Democratic culture, professional codes, digital futureAlexanderJeffrey CBreeseElizabeth ButlerLuengoMar\u00eda (eds) The crisis of journalism reconsidered: Democratic culture, professional codes, digital futureNew York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2016. 298 pp. ISBN 9781107448513|journal=Journalism: Theory, Practice & Criticism|language=en|volume=18|issue=7|pages=927\u2013929|doi=10.1177/1464884917692894}}</ref> People can also chose which accounts they want to follow on any social media platform. This has changed the way in which agenda setting is going and will continue to change throughout the evolution of technology and different media platforms.\n\nOne example that provides realistic criticism for this theory was the use of Twitter by reporters during the 2012 presidential election<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://shorensteincenter.org/d80-hamby/|title=Did Twitter Kill the Boys on the Bus?

Nowadays vertical media is undergoing rapid decline with the growing of \"horizontal media\" \u2013 new media enables everyone to become a source of information and influence, which means the media is \"distributed horizontally instead of top-down\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = As Digital Media Gets 'Horizontal,' It Acts More Like Local Businesses {{!}} Street Fight|url = http://streetfightmag.com/2013/10/04/as-digital-media-gets-horizontal-it-acts-more-like-local-businesses/|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Agenda-melding ===\nAnother change of Agenda-setting Theory is known as '''agenda-melding''', which focuses \"on the personal agendas of individuals vis-\u00e0-vis their community and group affiliations\".<ref name=\"Ragas\"/> This means that individuals join groups and blend their agendas with the agendas of the group. Then groups and communities represent a \"collected agenda of issues\" and \"one joins a group by adopting an agenda\". On the other hand, agenda setting defines groups as \"collections of people based on some shared values, attitudes, or opinions\" that individuals join.<ref name=\"Ragas\"/> This is different from traditional agenda setting because according to Shaw et al. individuals join groups in order to avoid social dissonance and isolation that is also known as \"need for orientation\".<ref name=\"Ragas\"/> Therefore, in the past in order to belong people would learn and adopt the agenda of the group. Now with the ease of access to media, people form their own agendas and then find groups that have similar agendas that they agree with.\n\nThe advances in technology have made agenda melding easy for people to develop because there is a wide range of groups and individual agendas. The Internet makes it possible for people all around the globe to find others with similar agendas and collaborate with them. In the past agenda setting was limited to general topics and it was geographically bound because travel was limited.<ref name=\"Ragas\"/>\n\n==Critique==\nVarious critiques have been made of agenda-setting theory:\n\n*Agenda setting is an inherently causal theory, but few studies establish the hypothesized temporal order (the media should set the public's agenda).\n*The measurement of the dependent variable was originally conceptualized as the public's perceived issue \"salience\", but subsequent studies have conceptualized the dependent variable as awareness, attention, or concern, leading to differing outcomes.\n*Studies tend to aggregate media content categories and public responses into very broad categories, resulting in inflated correlation coefficients.<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\"/>\n*The theory seemed to imply that the audience takes generally passive position. However, the public is not as passive as the theory assumed. Theorist John Fiske has challenged the view of a passive audience.<ref>Fiske, John. \"Television: Polysemy and popularity.\" Critical Studies in Media Communication 3.4 (1986): 391-408.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{divcol|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Availability heuristic]]\n* [[Business communication]]\n* [[Cultivation theory]]\n* [[Digital journalism]]\n* [[Framing effect (psychology)|Framing effect]]\n* [[Hypodermic needle model]]\n* [[Intertrial priming]]\n* [[Marketing]]\n* [[Mass hysteria]]\n* [[Media bias]]\n* [[Military\u2013industrial\u2013media complex]]\n* [[News values]]\n* [[Overton window]]\n* [[Policy by press release]]\n* [[Political agenda]]\n* [[Politico-media complex]]\n* [[Racial bias in criminal news]]\n* ''[[Schema (psychology)|Schema]]''\n* [[Sensationalism]]\n* [[Sociology]]\n* [[Spin (public relations)|Spin]]\n* [[Yellow journalism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = M. | last2 = Stroud | first2 = N.

Agenda setting is a social science theory; it also attempts to make predictions. The theory also suggests that media has a great influence to their audience by instilling what they should think instead of what they think. That is, if a news item is covered frequently and prominently, the audience will regard the issue as more important.  \n\nAgenda-setting is the creation of public awareness and concern of salient issues by the news media. As well, agenda-setting describes the way that media attempts to influence viewers, and establish a hierarchy of news prevalence. Two basic assumptions underlie most researches on agenda-setting: \n\n# the press and the media do not reflect reality; they filter and shape it;\n# media concentration on a few issues and subjects leads the public to perceive those issues as more important than other issues.\n\nThese core statements were established by measuring the changes in salience through the use of surveys with the presence of more frequent news coverage.<ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\" /><ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\" />\n\nOne of the most critical aspects in the concept of an agenda-setting role of [[mass communication]] is the time frame for this phenomenon. Different media have different agenda-setting potential. From the perspective of agenda setting, the analysis of the relationship between traditional media and new virtual spaces has witnessed growing momentum.<ref>ARUGUETE, N. (2017). The agenda setting hypothesis in the new media environment. Comunicaci\u00f3n Y Sociedad (0188-252X), (28), 35-58.</ref>\n\nIn the 1968 \"Chapel Hill study\", McCombs and [[Donald Lewis Shaw|Shaw]] demonstrated a strong [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]] (r > .9) between what 100 residents of [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]] thought was the most important election issue and what the local and national news media reported was the most important issue.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M|author2=Shaw, D|title=The agenda-setting function of mass media|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1972|volume=36|issue=2|doi=10.1086/267990|pages=176|url=http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/ESMP/article/view/62207}}</ref> By comparing the salience of issues in news content with the public's perceptions of the most important election issue, McCombs and [[Donald Lewis Shaw|Shaw]] were able to determine the degree to which the media determines [[public opinion]]. Since the 1968 study, published in a 1972 edition of ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]'', more than 400 studies have been published on the agenda-setting function of the [[mass media]], and the theory continues to be regarded as relevant.\nStudies have shown that what the media decides to expose in certain countries correlates with their views on things such as politics, economy and culture. Countries that tend to have more political power are more likely to receive media exposure. Financial resources, technologies, foreign trade and money spent on the military can be some of the main factors that explain coverage inequality.<ref name=\"McCombs 2005\">{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M|title=A look at agenda-setting: Past, present and future.|journal=Journalism Studies|year=2005|volume=6|issue=4|doi=10.1080/14616700500250438|pages=543\u2013557}}</ref>\n\nAgenda-setting can be traced to the first chapter of [[Walter Lippmann]]'s 1922 book, ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lippmann|first=W|title=Public opinion|url=https://archive.org/details/publicopinion00lippgoog|year=1922|publisher=Harcourt|location=New York}}</ref>  In that chapter, \"[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/lippman/ch01.html The World Outside And The Pictures In Our Heads]\", Lippmann argues that the mass media are the principal connection between events in the world and the images in the minds of the public. Without using the term \"agenda-setting\", Walter Lippmann was writing about what we today would call \"agenda-setting\". Following Lippmann, in 1963, [[Bernard Cecil Cohen|Bernard Cohen]] observed that the press \"may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about. The world will look different to different people,\" Cohen continues, \"depending on the map that is drawn for them by writers, editors, and publishers of the paper they read.\"<ref name=\"Cohen 1963\">{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=B|title=The press and foreign policy|year=1963|publisher=Harcourt|location=New York}}</ref> As early as the 1960s, Cohen had expressed the idea that later led to formalization of agenda-setting theory by McCombs and Shaw. The stories with the strongest agenda setting influence tend to be those that involve conflict, terrorism, crime and drug issues within the United States. Those that don't include or involve the United State and politics associate negatively with public opinion. In turn, there is less concern.\n\nAlthough Maxwell McCombs already had some interest in the field, he was exposed to Cohen's work while serving as a faculty member at [[UCLA]], and it was Cohen's work that heavily influenced him, and later Donald Shaw.<ref name=\"Rogers 1993 68\u201384\">{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=E|title=The anatomy of agenda-setting research|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=2|pages=68\u201384|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01263.x}}</ref> The concept of agenda setting was launched by McCombs and Shaw during the 1968 presidential election in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. They examined Lippmann's idea of construction of the pictures in our heads by comparing the issues on the media agenda with key issues on the undecided voters' agenda. They found evidence of agenda setting by identifying that salience of the news agenda is highly correlated to that of the voters' agenda. McCombs and Shaw were the first to provide the field of communication with empirical evidence that demonstrated the power of mass media and its influence on the public agenda. The empirical evidence also earned this theory its credibility amongst other social scientific theories.<ref name=\"Rogers 1993 68\u201384\" /><ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\" />\n\nA relatively unknown scholar named G. Ray Funkhouser performed a study highly similar to McCombs and Shaw's around the same time the authors were formalizing the theory.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Funkhouser|first=G|title=The issues of the sixties: An exploratory study in the dynamics of public opinion|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1973|volume=37|issue=1|pages=62\u201375|doi=10.1086/268060}}</ref>  All three scholars \u2013 McCombs, Shaw, and Funkhouser \u2013 even presented their findings at the same academic conference. Funkhouser's article was published later than McCombs and Shaw's, and Funkhouser doesn't receive as much credit as McCombs and Shaw for discovering agenda setting. According to Everett Rogers, there are two main reasons for this.<ref name=\"Rogers 1993 68\u201384\"/> First, Funkhouser didn't formally name the theory. Second, Funkhouser didn't pursue his research much past the initial article. Rogers also suggests that Funkhouser was geographically isolated at [[Stanford]], cut off from interested researchers, whereas McCombs and Shaw had got other people interested in agenda setting research.\n\n==Type==\nThe research on the effect of agenda setting compares the salience of issues in news content with the public perceptions of the most important issue, and then analyses the extent of influence by guidance of the media. There are three models assumed by Max McCombs: the awareness model, the priorities model and the salience model. Most investigations are centered on these three models. In the research, the dependent variables are media agenda, audience agenda and policy agenda as listed in the following part. Rogers and Dearing identify three types of agenda setting:<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\"/>\n\n#public agenda setting, in which the public's agenda is the [[Dependent and independent variables#Dependent variable|dependent variable]] (the traditional hypothesis)\n#media agenda setting, in which the media's agenda is treated as the dependent variable (\"agenda building\")\n#policy agenda setting, in which elite policy makers' agendas are treated as the dependent variable (\"political agenda setting\")\n\nMass communication research, Rogers and Dearing argue, has focused a great deal on public agenda setting (e.g. McCombs and Shaw, 1972) and media agenda setting, but has largely ignored [[overton window|policy agenda setting]], which is studied primarily by [[political science|political scientists]]. As such, the authors suggest mass communication scholars pay more attention to how the media and public agendas might influence elite policy maker's agendas (i.e. scholars should ask where the President or members of the U.S. Congress get their news from and how this affects their policies). Writing in 2006, Walgrave and Van Aelst took up Rogers and Dearing's suggestions, creating a preliminary theory of political agenda setting, which examines factors that might influence elite policy makers' agendas.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walgrave|first=S|author2=Van Aelst, P|title=The contingency of the mass media's political agenda setting power: Toward a preliminary theory|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2006|volume=56|pages=88\u2013109|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00005.x}}</ref>\n\n==Accessibility==\nAgenda setting occurs through a cognitive process known as \"accessibility\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Iyengar|first=S|title=News that mattes: Television and American opinion|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|author2=Kinder, D}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Iyengar|first=S|title=The accessibility bias in politics: Television news and public opinion|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=1990|volume=2|pages=1\u201315|doi=10.1093/ijpor/2.1.1}}</ref> Accessibility implies that the more frequently and prominently the news media cover an issue, the more instances of that issue become accessible in audience's memories. When respondents are asked what the most important problem facing the country is, they answer with the most accessible news issue in memory, which is typically the issue the news media focused on the most. The agenda-setting effect is not the result of receiving one or a few messages but is due to the aggregate impact of a very large number of messages, each of which has a different content but all of which deal with the same general issue.<ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\">{{cite journal|last=Dearing|first=J|title=Agenda-setting research: Where has it been, where is it going?|journal=Communication Yearbook|year=1988|volume=11|pages=555\u2013594|author2=Rogers, E}}</ref> \nMass-media coverage in general and agenda-setting in particular also has a powerful impact on what individuals think that other people are thinking,<ref name=\"Dearing 1988 555\u2013594\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Noelle-Neumann|first=E|title=Turbulances in the climate of opinion:Methodological applications of the spiral of silence theory|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1977|volume=41 | issue = 2|pages=143\u2013158|doi = 10.1086/268371 }}</ref> and hence they tend to allocate more importance to issues that have been extensively covered by mass media. This is also called [[Schema (psychology)|schemata theory]]. In psychology and cognitive science, a schema (plural schemata or schemas) describes a pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories of information and the relationships among them.\n\n==Comparison to agenda-building==\nAs more scholars published articles on agenda-setting theories it became evident that the process involves not only active role of media organizations, but also participation of the public<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\">{{cite journal|last=Erbring|first=L|author2=Goldenberg, E.N.|author3=Miller, A.H.|title=Front-page news and real-world cues: A new look at agenda-setting by the media.|journal=American Journal of Political Science|year=1980|volume=24|issue=1|pages=16\u201349|doi=10.2307/2110923|jstor=2110923}}</ref><ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\">{{cite journal |last=Lang|first=G.E.|author2=Lang, K.|title=Watergate: An exploration of the agenda-building process|editor=Wilhout, G.C.| editor2=de Bock, H.|journal=Mass Communication Review Yearbook|year=1981|volume=2|pages=447\u2013468}}</ref> as well as policymakers.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\">{{cite journal|last=Berkowitz|first=D|title=Who sets the media agenda?

The media agenda in fact is the result of the influences that certain powerful groups exert as a subtle form of social control. Journalists have limited time and limited resources that can contribute to external sources getting involved in the news media's gatekeeping process, and some scholars have attempted to reveal certain relationships between information sources and the agenda the news media has made up, probing who builds the media agenda. There are multiple sources that can participate in this agenda-building process through various different ways, but researchers have been the most interested in the effectiveness of information aids such as media kits and press releases within the news media agenda, and this is a measure of the success of organizations public relations efforts.\n\nBerkowitz has implemented a more nuanced analysis of agenda-setting and agenda-building theories by introducing the terms policy agenda-setting and policy agenda-building.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/> He argues that when scholars investigate only the linkage between media and policymakers, it is still appropriate to use the notion of policy agenda-setting.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/> However, when the focus is placed not only on policymakers' personal agendas, but also on the broader salient issues where media represent only one indicator of public sentiment, Berkowitz suggests talking about policy agenda-building.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/>\n\n== Research on policymakers and public ==\n\n=== Role of policymakers in agenda-setting process ===\nSome groups have a greater ease of access than others and are thus more likely to get their demands placed on agenda than others.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\">{{cite journal|last=Cobb|first=R.W.|author2=Elder, C.|title=The politics of agenda-building: An alternative perspective for modern democratic theory|journal=Journal of Politics|year=1971|volume=33|issue=4|pages=892\u2013915|doi=10.2307/2128415|jstor=2128415|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e47bf34ab7ec85bfc5e0ace18859a5b015c9f347}}</ref>  For instance, policymakers have been found to be more influential than the overall group of news sources because they often better understand journalists' needs for reliable and predictable information and their definition of newsworthiness.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/> Cobb and Elder ascribed even more importance to decision makers, claiming that in order for an issue to attain agenda status, it must be supported by at least some of key decision makers as they act as guardians of the formal agenda.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\"/>  They also asserted that certain personages in the media can act as opinion leaders and bring media coverage to a particular issue.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\"/> Government-affiliated news sources have higher success rates in becoming media agenda and have been found by a number of scholars to be the most frequently appearing of sources at the local, state, and national levels.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/>\n\nNews sources can also provide definitions of issues, thus determining the terms of future discussion and framing problems in particular ways.<ref name=\"Berkowitz 1992 81\u2013102\"/><ref name=\"Hilgarten 1988 53\u201378\">{{cite journal|last=Hilgarten|first=S|author2=Bosk, C.L.|title=The rise and fall of social problems: A public arenas model|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=1988|volume=94|pages=53\u201378|doi=10.1086/228951}}</ref>  What interpretation of \"reality\" will dominate public discourse has implications for the future of the social problem, for the interest groups and policymakers involved, and for the policy itself.<ref name=\"Hilgarten 1988 53\u201378\"/>  For example, Gusfield argues that the highway deaths associated with alcohol consumption can be interpreted as a problem of irresponsible drunken drivers, insufficient automobile [[crashworthiness]], a transportation system overly dependent on cars, poor highway design, excessive emphasis on drinking in adult social life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gusfield|first=J.R.|title=The culture of public problems|url=https://archive.org/details/cultureofpublicp00gusf|url-access=registration|year=1981|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref> Different ways of framing the situation may compete to be accepted as an authoritative version of reality,<ref name=\"Hilgarten 1988 53\u201378\"/> consequently spurring competition between sources of information for definition of an issue.

Thus according to Cobb and Elder, the agenda-building framework makes allowances for continuing mass involvement and broaden the range of recognized influences on the public policy-making process.<ref name=\"Cobb 1971 892\u2013915\"/> Although the public does have a place on the list of possibly influencing the media agenda, they are not thought to powerfully shape media agendas. It seems the more correct to argue the possibility that when journalists look to their own interests for story ideas, they are actually trying to predict their audience's needs.\n\nThis idea of mass involvement has become more prominent with the advent of the Internet and its potential to make everyone a pamphleteer.<ref name=\"Benkler\"/> Increase in the role of citizens in agenda setting sheds light on a new direction in the traditional agenda-building research. This is now the case because the general public can now create their own media. Social media has changed the way people view and perceive things in today's world. Mass involvement within social media lets the general publics voices be heard. Comments and reply's give potential for people to address your thoughts or open new doors for conversation.\n\nKim and Lee<ref name=\"Kim\"/> noted that the agenda-setting research on the Internet differs from traditional agenda-setting research with respect that the Internet is in competition with traditional media and has enormous capacity for contents' and users' interactivity.

Scholars found that a person's opinion could be disseminated through various online channels and could synthesize public opinion that influences news coverage. Their study suggests 'reversed agenda effects', meaning that public agenda could set media agenda. Maxwell McCombs<ref>{{cite book|last=McCombs|first=Maxwell|title=Setting the Agenda: The Mass Media and Public Opinion|url=https://archive.org/details/settingagendamas0000mcco/page/198|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Pub|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-7456-2313-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/settingagendamas0000mcco/page/198 198]|edition=Repr.}}</ref> also mentioned \"reverse agenda-setting\" in his recent textbook as a situation where public concern sets the media agenda.\n\nAccording to Kim and Lee,<ref name=\"Kim\"/> agenda-building through the Internet take the following three steps: 1) Internet-mediated agenda-rippling: an anonymous netizen's opinion spreads to the important agenda in the Internet through online main rippling channels such as blogs, personal homepages, and the Internet bulletin boards. 2) agenda diffusion in the Internet: online news or web-sites report the important agenda in the Internet that in turn leads to spreading the agenda to more online publics. 3) Internet-mediated reversed agenda-setting: traditional media report online agenda to the public so that the agenda spread to both offline and online publics. However, scholars concluded that the Internet-mediated agenda-setting or agenda-building processes not always occur in consecutive order. For example, the agenda that was reported by traditional media can come to the fore again through the online discussion or the three steps can occur simultaneously in a short period of time.\n\nSeveral studies provide evidence that the Internet-community, particularly bloggers, can push their own agenda into public agenda, then media agenda, and, eventually, into policy agenda. In the most comprehensive study to date, Wallsten<ref>Wallsten, Kevin (2007). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00300.x/abstract;jsessionid=28AD554C0CBC1E693100AB5BF7818290.f02t04?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false Agenda setting and the blogosphere: An analysis of the relationship between mainstream media and political blogs], [[Review of Policy Research]].</ref> tracked mainstream media coverage and blog discussion of 35 issues during the 2004 presidential campaign. Using [[time-series analysis]], Wallsten found evidence that journalists discuss the issues that bloggers are blogging about. There are also anecdotal pieces of evidence suggesting bloggers exert an influence on the political agenda. For instance, in 2005 Eason Jordan, the chief news executive at CNN, abruptly resigned after being besieged by the online community after saying, according to various witnesses, that he believed the United States military had aimed at journalists in Iraq and killed 12 of them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Seelye|first=K.Q.|title=Resignation at CNN shows the growing influence of blogs|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/14/technology/14cnn.html |accessdate=30 October 2014|work=The New York Times|date=14 February 2005}}</ref> Similarly, in 2002, [[Trent Lott]] had to resign as [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate majority leader]] due to his inappropriate racist remarks that were widely discussed in the blogosphere.<ref name=\"Benkler\">{{cite book|last=Benkler|first=Y|title=The wealth of networks: How Social production transforms markets and freedom|url=https://archive.org/details/wealthofnetworks00benk|url-access=registration|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT}}</ref> However bloggers attract attention not only to oust journalists and politicians. An online investigation on technical problems with electronic voting machines started by an activist Bev Harris in 2003 eventually forced traditional media outlets to address issue of electronic voting malperformance. This in turn made Diebold, a company that produces these machines, to acknowledge its fault and take measures to fix it. Many studies have been performed to test the agenda setting theory within global news coverage. One of the findings determined that foreign news that had any mentions of the United States or the UK, greatly influenced public opinion compared to global news that didn't involve either country.\n\n<ref name=\"Benkler\"/>\n\n==Contingency factors==\n{{see also|contingency factors}}\n===Issue obtrusiveness===\nIn an attempt to overcome mirror-image effects of agenda-setting that implied direct influence of media agenda on the audience, several scholars proposed that the model of agenda-setting should include individual/collective audience characteristics or real-world conditions that are likely to affect issue importance. They discovered that certain individual and group characteristics are likely to act as contingent conditions of [[media impact]] and proposed a model of \"audience effects\".<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\" />\n\nAccording to the audience-effects model, [[media coverage]] interacts with the audience's pre-existing sensitivities to produce changes in issue concerns. Thus, media effects are contingent on issue-specific audience characteristics.<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\" /> For instance, for high-sensitivity audiences who are most affected by a certain issue or a problem, the salience of this issue increases substantially with news exposure, while the same exposure has little effect on other groups. Erbring, Goldenberg and Miller have also demonstrated that people who do not talk about political issues are more subject to agenda-setting influence because they depend more heavily on media content than those who receive information from other sources, including their colleagues and friends.<ref name=\"Erbring 1980 16\u201349\" />\n\nAnother factor that causes variations in the [[correlation]] between the media and public agenda is whether an issue is \"obtrusive\" or \"unobtrusive\";<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\" /> i.e., whether it has a high or low issue threshold.<ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\" /> Obtrusive or issues with low threshold are generally the ones that affect nearly everyone and with which we can have some kind of personal experience (e.g. citywide crime or increases in [[Gasoline and diesel usage and pricing|gasoline prices]]). Because of their link to personal concerns, these issues almost compel attention from [[political elite]]s as well as the news media. Moreover, with this type of issues the problem would be of general concern even without attention from the news media.<ref name=\"Lang\">{{cite journal|last=Lang|first=G.E.|author2=Lang, K.|title=Watergate: An exploration of the agenda-building process|editor=Wilhout, G.C.| editor2=de Bock, H.|journal=Mass Communication Review Yearbook|year=1981|volume=2|pages=447\u2013468}}</ref>\n\nUnobtrusive or high threshold issues are those issues that are generally remote from just about everyone (e.g., high-level wrongdoing, such as the [[Watergate scandal]]; plight of [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]]). Research performed by Zucker suggests that an issue is obtrusive if most members of the public have had direct contact with it, and less obtrusive if audience members have not had direct experience. This means that the less direct experience people have with an issue, the greater is the news media's influence on public opinion on that issue.<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\" /><ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Zucker|first=H|title=The variable nature of news media influence.|journal=Communication Yearbook|year=1978|volume=2|pages=225\u2013246}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, unobtrusive or high-threshold issues do not pertain into media agenda as quickly as obtrusive issues and therefore require a buildup, which is a function of more than the amount of space or time the media devote to the story. The latter may push the story past the threshold of inattention, but it is also important to look at the kind of coverage to explain how a certain incident becomes an issue.<ref name=\"Lang 1981 447\u2013468\" />\n\n===Need for orientation===\nAgenda-setting studies typically show variability in the correlation between media and public agenda. To explain differences in the correlation, McCombs and colleagues created the concept of \"need for orientation\", which \"describes individual differences in the desire for orienting cues and background information\".\n\nTwo concepts: [[relevance]] and [[uncertainty]], define an individual's need for orientation. Relevance suggests that an individual will not seek news media information if an issue is not personally relevant. Hence, if relevance is low, people will feel the need for less orientation. There are many issues in our country that are just not relevant to people, because they do not affect us. Many news organizations attempt to frame issues in a way that attempts to make them relevant to its audiences. This is their way of keeping their viewership/readership high. \"Level of uncertainty is the second defining condition of need for orientation. Frequently, individuals already have all the information that they desire about a topic. Their degree of uncertainty is low.\"<ref>Mccombs, (2004) p. 55</ref> When issues are of high personal relevance and uncertainty low, the need to monitor any changes in those issues will be present and there will be a moderate the need for orientation. If at any point in time viewers/readers have high relevance and high uncertainty about any type of issue/event/election campaign there was a high need for orientation.\n\nDavid Weaver (1977)<ref name=\"Weaver, D. H.\">{{cite book|last=al.]|first=Donald L. Shaw, Maxwell E. McCombs ; in association with Lee B. Becker ...

Research done by Weaver in 1977 suggested that individuals vary on their need for orientation. Need for orientation is a combination of the individual's interest in the topic and uncertainty about the issue. The higher levels of interest and uncertainty produce higher levels of need for orientation. So the individual would be considerably likely to be influenced by the [[news media|media]] stories (psychological aspect of theory).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weaver|first=D|title=Political issues and voter need for orientation|journal=In D.L.

Each of the objects on an agenda has a lot of attributes containing cognitive components such as information that describes characteristics of the object, and an affective component including tones (positive, negative, neutral) of the characteristics on agenda. The agenda setting theory and the second level of agenda setting, framing, are both relevant and similar in demonstrating how society is influenced by media, but they describe a different process of influence. One tells us what information to process and the other tells us how to process that information. Framing theory, an extension of agenda setting, describes how the \"stance\" an article of media may take can affect the perception of the viewer. It is said that there are two main attributes of the second-level of agenda setting. Those include substantive and affective. The substantive factor has to do mainly with things such as personality and ideology. The affective factor is focused on the positive, negative, and neutral side of things.\n\n==== Second-level agenda-setting vs. framing ====\nMcCombs et al. (1997)<ref name=\"McCombs et al 1997\">{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M. E.|author2=Llamas, J. P. |author3= Lopez-Escobar, E. |author4= Rey, F.|title=Candidate's images in Spanish elections: Second-level agenda-setting effects|journal=Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|year=1997|volume=74|issue=4|pages=703\u2013717|doi=10.1177/107769909707400404}}[http://www.aejmc.org/home/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Journalism-Mass-Communication-Quarterly1997-McCombs-703-17.pdf Pdf.]</ref> demonstrated that agenda-setting research at the second level deals with the influence of 'attribute' salience, whereas the first level agenda-setting illustrates the influence of 'issue' salience. Balmas and Sheafer (2010)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Balmas|first=M|author2=Sheafer, T|title=Candidate Image in Election Campaigns: Attribute Agenda Setting, Affective Priming, and Voting Intentions|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|date=June 2010|volume=22|issue=2|pages=204\u2013229|doi=10.1093/ijpor/edq009}}</ref>  argued that the focus at the first level agenda-setting which emphasizes media's role in telling us \"what to think about\" is shifted to media's function of telling us \"how to think about\" at the second level agenda-setting. The second level of agenda-setting considers how the agenda of attributes affects public opinion (McCombs & Evatt, 1995). Furthermore, Ghanem(1997)<ref name=\"Ghanem, S.\">{{cite book|last=Weaver|first=ed. by Maxwell McCombs, Donald L. Shaw, David|title=Communication and democracy : exploring the intellectual frontiers in agenda-setting theory|year=1997|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, N.J.|isbn=978-0-8058-2555-8|edition=[Nachdr.].}}</ref>  demonstrated that the certain attributes agendas in the news with low psychological distance, drove compelling arguments for the salience of public agenda. The second-level agenda-setting differs from traditional agenda-setting in that it focus on attribute salience, and public's attribute agenda is regarded as one of the important variables. An example of framing is when a company releases a statement that sounds a lot better than what it actually is. Acting like it the fine print that people don't see. They \"frame\" it to sound better and more appealing to the public. This can also take place in crisis management, when companies release a statement to save the companies reputation after a crisis occurred. This was very prominent in the BP oil spill several years ago.\n\nOne example that helps illustrate the effects of framing involves president Nixon's involvement in the watergate scandal. According to a study conducted by Lang and Lang, the media coverage at first belittled the watergate scandal and the President's involvement. It wasn't until the story was framed as one of the highest political scandals in US history that the public opinion changed (Lang & Lang, 1981) This event depicts how the media personnel have a great deal of power in persuading the public's opinions. It also suggests that framing is a form of gatekeeping, similar to  the agenda setting theory.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lang & Lang|title=Watergate: An exploration of the agenda-building process.|journal=Mass Communication Review Yearbook|date=1981}}</ref>\n\nThere is a debate over whether [[Framing (social sciences)|framing theory]] should be subsumed within agenda-setting as \"second-level agenda-setting\". McCombs, Shaw, Weaver and colleagues generally argue that framing is a part of agenda-setting that operates as a \"second-level\" or secondary effect. [[Dietram Scheufele]] has argued the opposite. Scheufele argues that framing and agenda-setting possess distinct theoretical boundaries, operate via distinct cognitive processes (accessibility vs. attribution), and relate to different outcomes (perceptions of issue importance vs. interpretation of news issue).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scheufele|first=D|title=Agenda-setting, priming, and framing revisited: Another look at cognitive effects of political communication|journal=Mass Communication & Society|year=2000|volume=3|issue=2|pages=297\u2013316|doi=10.1207/s15327825mcs0323_07}}</ref>\n\nWhen talking about the second-level of agenda setting, as well as the political aspects of the theory, its pivotal to include priming. Priming is considered to be the step past agenda setting, and is also referred to as the last step of the process. Priming is primarily used in political settings. It discusses how the media will choose to leave some issues about the candidates out of coverage, while presenting other issues in the fore front. This process creates different standards by which the public evaluates candidates. As well, by reporting the issues that have the most salience on the public; they are not objectively presenting both candidates equally. \n \nAccording to Weaver,<ref>Weaver, D. H. (2007). Thoughts on Agenda Setting, Framing, and Priming. Journal of Communication, 57(1), 142\u2013147. {{doi|10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00333.x}}</ref> framing and second-level agenda setting have the following characteristics:\n\n'''Similarities:'''\n\n# Both are more concerned with how issues or other objects are depicted in the media than with which issues or objects are more or less prominently reported.\n# Both focus on most salient or prominent aspects of themes or descriptions of the objects of interest.\n# Both are concerned with ways of thinking rather than objects of thinking\n\n'''Differences:'''\n\n# Framing does seem to include a broader range of cognitive processes \u2013 moral evaluations, causal reasoning, appeals to principle, and recommendations for treatment of problems \u2013 than does second-level agenda-setting (the salience of attributes of an object). <br/> Scheufele and Tewksbury argue that \"framing differs significantly from these accessibility-based models [i.e., agenda setting and priming]. It is based on the assumption that how an issue is characterized in news reports can have an influence on how it is understood by audiences;\"<ref name=\"Scheufele, D. A. 2007\"/> the difference between whether we think about an issue and how we think about it. Framing and agenda setting differ in their functions in the process of '''news production''', '''information processing''' and '''media effects'''.\n# '''News production''': Although \"both frame building and agenda building refer to macroscopic mechanisms that deal with message construction rather than media effects\", frame building is more concerned with the news production process than agenda building. In other words, \"how forces and groups in society try to shape public discourse about an issue by establishing predominant labels is of far greater interest from a framing perspective than from a traditional agenda-setting one.\"\n# '''News processing''': For framing and agenda-setting, different conditions seem to be needed in processing messages to produce respective effects. Framing effect is more concerned with audience attention to news messages, while agenda setting is more concerned with repeated exposure to messages.\n# '''Locus of effect''': Agenda-setting effects are determined by the ease with which people can retrieve from their memory issues recently covered by mass media, while framing is the extent to which media messages fit ideas or knowledge people have in their knowledge store.\n\nBased on these shared characteristics, McCombs and colleagues<ref>McCombs, M. E., Shaw, D. L., & Weaver, D. H. (1997). Communication and democracy: Explorining the intellectual frontiers in agenda-setting theory. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.</ref> recently argued that framing effects should be seen as the extension of agenda setting. In other words, according to them, the premise that framing is about selecting \"a restricted number of thematically related attributes\"<ref>McCombs, M. E., Shaw, D. L., & Weaver, D. H. (1997). p. 106</ref>  for media representation can be understood as the process of transferring the salience of issue attributes (i.e., second-level agenda setting). That is, according to McCombs and colleagues' arguments, framing falls under the umbrella of agenda setting.\n\n====Accessibility (agenda-setting) vs. applicability (framing)====\nAccording to Price and Tewksbury,<ref>Price, V., & Tewksbury, D. (1997). News values and public opinion: A theoretical account of media priming and framing. In G. Barnett & F. Boster (Eds.), Progress in communication sciences (pp. 173-212). Norwood, N.J.: Ablex Pub. Corp.</ref> however, agenda-setting and framing are built on different theoretical premises: agenda-setting is based on '''accessibility''', while framing is concerned with '''applicability''' (i.e., the relevance between message features and one's stored ideas or knowledge). Accessibility-based explanation of agenda-setting is also applied to second-level agenda-setting. That is, transferring the salience of issue attributes (i.e., second-level agenda-setting) is a function of accessibility.\n\nFor framing effects, empirical evidence shows that the impact of frames on public perceptions is mainly determined by perceived importance of specific frames rather than by the quickness of retrieving frames.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = T. | last2 = Clawson | first2 = R. | last3 = Oxley | first3 = Z. | year = 1997 | title = Media framing of a civil liberties conflict and its effect on tolerance | url = | journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 91 | issue = 3| pages = 567\u2013583 | doi=10.2307/2952075| jstor = 2952075 }}</ref> That is, the way framing effects transpires is different from the way second-level agenda-setting is supposed to take place (i.e., accessibility). On a related note, Scheufele and Tewksbury<ref name=\"Scheufele, D. A. 2007\">Scheufele, D. A., & Tewksbury, D. (2007). Framing, agenda-setting, and priming: The evolution of three media effects models. Journal of Communication, 57(1), 9-20.</ref> argues that, because accessibility and applicability vary in their functions of media effects, \"the distinction between accessibility and applicability effects has obvious benefits for understanding and predicting the effects of dynamic information environments\".\n\nTaken together, it can be concluded that the integration of framing into agenda-setting is either impossible because they are based on different theoretical premises or imprudent because merging the two concepts would result in the loss of our capabilities to explain various media effects.\n\n(a) ''' Accessibility (Agenda-setting)'''\n\nIncreasing attention has been devoted to examining how agenda-setting occur in terms of their psychological mechanisms (Holbrook & Hill, 2005). Price and Tewksbury (1997) argued that agenda-setting effects are based on the accessibility model of information processing. Accessibility can be defined as \"how much\" or \"how recently\" a person has been exposed to certain issues (Kim et al., 2002). Specifically, individuals try to make less cognitive effort in forming social judgments, they are more likely to rely on the information that is easily accessible (Higgins, 1996). This leads to a greater probability that more accessible information will be used when people make judgments on certain issues (Iyeanger & Kinder, 1987; Scheufele & Tewksbury, 2007).\n\nThe concept of accessibility is the foundation of a memory-based model (Scheufele, 2000). It assumes that individuals make judgments on the issues based on information that is easily available and retrievable from their memory (Tulving & Watkins, 1975; Hastie & Park, 1986; Iyengar, 1990). Tversky and Kahneman (1974) also argue that the formation of individuals' judgments directly correlates with \"the ease in which instances or associations could be brought to mind\" (p.&nbsp;208). When individuals receive and process information, they develop memory traces that can be easily recalled to make decisions on a certain issue. Agenda-setting, in this regard, can make certain issue to be easily accessed in individual's memory when forming judgment about the issue.\n\n(b) '''Applicability (Framing)'''\n\nThe idea of framing theory is closely related to the agenda-setting theory tradition but it expands more upon the research by focusing on the substance of certain issues at hand rather than on a particular topic. This means that the framing theory's basis is that of the media focuses its attention on certain events and then places them within a field of meaning.  is the process of selecting certain aspects of an issue to bring people's attention and to lead them a particular line of interpretation (Entman, 1993; Scheufele, 1999). Also, the media's selective uses of certain frames can affect the way the audience thinks about the issue (Oh & Kim, 2010). This may sound similar to attribute agenda-setting. Both seem to examine which attributes or aspects of an issue are emphasized in the media (Kim et al., 2011). Some scholars even argue that framing should be considered as an extension of agenda-setting (McCombs, 1997).\n\nHowever, framing is based on the applicability model, which is conceptually different from the accessibility model used in agenda-setting. According to Goffman (1974), individuals actively classify and interpret their life experiences to make sense of the world around them. These classifications and interpretations then become the individual's pre-existing and long-standing schema. Framing influences how audience thinks about issues, not by making certain aspects more salient than others, but by invoking interpretive cues that correspond to the individuals' pre-existing schema (Scheufele, 2000). Also, framing is when these interpretive cues correspond with or activate individuals' pre-existing cognitive schema (Kim et al., 2002). Applicability, in this regard, refers to finding the connection between the message in the media and the framework individuals employ to interpret the issue (Scheufele & Tewksbury, 2007).\n\nKim and his colleagues (2002) provide distinction between the applicability and accessibility models is important in terms of issue salience. Framing assumes that each individual will have its own interpretation of an issue, regardless of the salience of an issue. Specifically, it focuses on the \"terminological or semantic differences\" of how an issue is described. Agenda-setting, on the other hand, assume that only salient issues in the media will become accessible in people's minds when they evaluate or make judgments on the issue. Taken together, the accessibility of issue salience makes the two models of information processing different (Scheufele, 2000).\n\n==== An emotion dimension ====\nAccording to the theory of affective intelligence, \"emotions enhance citizen rationality\". It argues that emotions, particularly negative ones, are crucial in having people pay attention to politics and help shape their political views.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Affective Intelligence and Political Judgment|last1 = Marcus |first1 = George E. |last2 = Neuman |first2 = W.

They find that apart from the cognitive assessment, which is commonly studied before, emotion is another critical dimension of the second-level affects in agenda-setting. Three conclusions are presented:\n* The media's emotional-affective agenda corresponds with the public's emotional impressions of candidates;\n* Negative emotions are more powerful than positive emotions;\n* Agenda-setting effects are greater on the audiences' emotions than on their cognitive assessments of character traits.\n\n=== Agenda setting between media and other sources ===\nRecent research on agenda-setting digs into the question of \"who sets the media agenda\".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application |edition = 5th |last1 = West |first1 = Richard |last2 = Turner |first2 = Lynn H. |publisher = McGraw-Hill Education|year = 2013|location = New York, NY|pages = 377\u2013378 }}</ref>\n\n==== Power relations between media and other sources ====\nLittlejohn and Foss (2011)<ref>{{Cite book|title = Theories of Human Communication|edition = 10th |last1 = Littlejohn |first1 = Stephen W. |last2 = Foss |first2 = Karen A. |publisher = Waveland Press, Inc.|year = 2010|location = Long Grove, IL }}</ref> suggest that there are four types of power relations between media and other sources:\n* High-power source & high-power media: both are equals in setting the agenda\n* High-power source & low-power media: the source sets the agenda for the media\n* Low-power source & high-power media: the media set their own agenda and may marginalize the source\n* Low-power source & low-power media: both are too weak to set the public agenda\n\n==== Intermedia agenda setting ====\nNews organizations affect one another's agendas.

These publications have a direct effect on local newspapers and television networks that are viewed on a less elite scale.\n\nWebsite networks favor other websites that tend to have a higher viewing and SEO. This type of relationship is known as Power Law which allows the media to have a stronger effect on agenda setting. \"Furthermore, the \"birds of a feather\" argument suggests that because news now exists in a network of connected websites, elite and other types of news media are now more motivated to behave similarly.\"\n\n=== Third-level agenda-setting: network agenda setting model ===\nThe most recent agenda-setting studies explore \"the extent to which the news media can transfer the salience of relationships among a set of elements to the public\".<ref>{{Cite journal|title = New Directions in Agenda-Setting Theory and Research |last1 = McCombs |first1 = Maxwell E. |last2 = Shaw |first2 = Donald L. |last3 = Weaver |first3 = David H. |date = November 2014 |journal = Mass Communication & Society | pages = 781\u2013802 |doi=10.1080/15205436.2014.964871 |volume=17|issue = 6 }}</ref> That is, researchers assume that the media can not only influence the salience of certain topics in public agenda, but they can also influence how the public relate these topics to one another.

This model shows that \"the news media can bundle sets of objects or attributes and make these bundles of elements salient in the public's mind simultaneously\". In other words, elements in people's mind are not linear as traditional approaches indicate; instead, they are interconnected with each other to make a network-like structure in one's mind; and if the news media always mention two elements together, the audience will \"perceive these two elements as interconnected\".\n\n==Application==\n===Twitter application===\nOver the last few years, the increase in social media use has had a direct effect on political campaign strategy, particularly on the Social Media platform Twitter. Its unique platform allows users to showcase their political opinion without functioning two directions. It is currently being viewed as a platform for political advancement. Before the use of Twitter, political candidates were using blogs and websites to portray their message and to gain more attention and popularity among their followers. Some of the most followed users on Twitter are past and current Presidents of the United States and other political figures. In terms of retweets, politicians and political parties have been labeled \"influentials\" on Twitter. Twitter is being used as a resource to gather information, reach a larger audience and engagement, stay up to date with current social and political issues, and to achieve the agenda building role. Twitter helps express public opinion which in turn allows a relationship to form between the media and the public. Some may argue that Twitter is still being used as a place for people to follow celebrity news and the culture of Hollywood more than it is being used for important issues and world news. Some may also argue that Twitter does not have the ability to set an agenda as much as conventional news outlets. A 2015 study found a positive correlation between issue ranks in news coverage and issue ranks in Twitter feeds, suggesting that Twitter and conventional news outlets by and large reflected each other.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Conway|first1=Bethany A.|last2=Kenski|first2=Kate|last3=Wang|first3=Di|title=The Rise of Twitter in the Political Campaign: Searching for Intermedia Agenda-Setting Effects in the Presidential Primary|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=July 2015|volume=20|issue=4|pages=363\u2013380|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12124}}</ref> The influence of Twitter may not always seem direct and can change during different phases.\n\n===Non-political application===\nMcCombs and Shaw originally established agenda-setting within the context of a presidential election. Many subsequent studies have looked at agenda setting in the context of an election or in otherwise political contexts. However, more recently scholars have been studying agenda setting in the context of brand community. A brand is defined as what resides in the minds of individuals about a product or service. Brand community is described as a \"specialized, non-geographically bound community based on a structured set of social relations among admirers of a brand.<ref name=Ragas>{{cite journal|last=Ragas|first=Matthew|author2=Marilyn Roberts|title=Agenda Setting and Agenda Melding in an Age of Horizontal and Vertical Media: A New Theoretical Lens for Virtual Brand Communities|journal=Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2009|volume=86|issue=1|pages=45\u201364|issn=1077-6990|doi=10.1177/107769900908600104}}</ref>\" Under these definitions more than just material products can qualify as a brand, political candidates or even celebrities could be viewed as a brand as well.

The theory has not been limited to elections, and many scholars constantly explored the agenda-setting effect in a variety of communication situations. This explains that agenda-setting has a theoretical value which is able to synthesize social phenomena and to build new research questions.\n\nAnother contribution of agenda-setting is to show the power of media. Since the study of [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]] in [[Erie County, Ohio]], by Paul Lazarsfeld and his colleagues, little evidence of mass communication effects was found over the next twenty years. In 1960, Joseph Klapper's ''Effects of Mass Communication'' also declared the limited effect of media. Agenda-setting caused a paradigm shift in the study of media effects from persuading to informing by its connection of media content and its effects on the public.\n\n==Future==\n\n=== Advent of the Internet ===\nThe advent of the Internet and social networks give rise to a variety of opinions concerning agenda-setting effects online. Some have claimed that the power of traditional media has been weakened.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Meraz | first1 = Sharon | year = 2011 | title = The fight for 'how to think': Traditional media, social networks, and issue interpretation | url = | journal = Journalism | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 107\u2013127 | doi=10.1177/1464884910385193}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wallsten | first1 = Kevin | year = 2007 | title = Agenda setting and the blogosphere: An analysis of the relationship between mainstream media and political blogs | url = | journal = Review of Policy Research | volume = 24 | issue = 6| pages = 567\u2013587 | doi=10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00300.x}}</ref> Others think that the agenda-setting process and its role have continued on the Internet, specifically in electronic bulletin boards.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Marilyn | last2 = Wanta | first2 = Wayne | last3 = Dustin Dzwo | first3 = Tzong-Horng | year = 2002 | title = Agenda setting and issue salience online | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 452\u2013465 | doi=10.1177/0093650202029004004}}</ref> With the presence of rapid mass communication, like social media, the agenda setting theory is both supported and challenged to evolve. Some suggest that social media and traditional media in political campaigns will integrate. Social media is the next step of agenda setting because now popular Twitter handles can now choose what they want their followers to see. While some theorize that the rise of social media will bring a downfall to journalists ability to set the agenda, there is considerable scholarship to counterbalance this form of thinking.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Ryan J|date=2017-02-12|title=Book Review: Jeffrey C Alexander, Elizabeth Butler Breese and Mar\u00eda Luengo (eds) The crisis of journalism reconsidered: Democratic culture, professional codes, digital futureAlexanderJeffrey CBreeseElizabeth ButlerLuengoMar\u00eda (eds) The crisis of journalism reconsidered: Democratic culture, professional codes, digital futureNew York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2016. 298 pp. ISBN 9781107448513|journal=Journalism: Theory, Practice & Criticism|language=en|volume=18|issue=7|pages=927\u2013929|doi=10.1177/1464884917692894}}</ref> People can also chose which accounts they want to follow on any social media platform. This has changed the way in which agenda setting is going and will continue to change throughout the evolution of technology and different media platforms.\n\nOne example that provides realistic criticism for this theory was the use of Twitter by reporters during the 2012 presidential election<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://shorensteincenter.org/d80-hamby/|title=Did Twitter Kill the Boys on the Bus?

Nowadays vertical media is undergoing rapid decline with the growing of \"horizontal media\" \u2013 new media enables everyone to become a source of information and influence, which means the media is \"distributed horizontally instead of top-down\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = As Digital Media Gets 'Horizontal,' It Acts More Like Local Businesses {{!}} Street Fight|url = http://streetfightmag.com/2013/10/04/as-digital-media-gets-horizontal-it-acts-more-like-local-businesses/|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Agenda-melding ===\nAnother change of Agenda-setting Theory is known as '''agenda-melding''', which focuses \"on the personal agendas of individuals vis-\u00e0-vis their community and group affiliations\".<ref name=\"Ragas\"/> This means that individuals join groups and blend their agendas with the agendas of the group. Then groups and communities represent a \"collected agenda of issues\" and \"one joins a group by adopting an agenda\". On the other hand, agenda setting defines groups as \"collections of people based on some shared values, attitudes, or opinions\" that individuals join.<ref name=\"Ragas\"/> This is different from traditional agenda setting because according to Shaw et al. individuals join groups in order to avoid social dissonance and isolation that is also known as \"need for orientation\".<ref name=\"Ragas\"/> Therefore, in the past in order to belong people would learn and adopt the agenda of the group. Now with the ease of access to media, people form their own agendas and then find groups that have similar agendas that they agree with.\n\nThe advances in technology have made agenda melding easy for people to develop because there is a wide range of groups and individual agendas. The Internet makes it possible for people all around the globe to find others with similar agendas and collaborate with them. In the past agenda setting was limited to general topics and it was geographically bound because travel was limited.<ref name=\"Ragas\"/>\n\n==Critique==\nVarious critiques have been made of agenda-setting theory:\n\n*Agenda setting is an inherently causal theory, but few studies establish the hypothesized temporal order (the media should set the public's agenda).\n*The measurement of the dependent variable was originally conceptualized as the public's perceived issue \"salience\", but subsequent studies have conceptualized the dependent variable as awareness, attention, or concern, leading to differing outcomes.\n*Studies tend to aggregate media content categories and public responses into very broad categories, resulting in inflated correlation coefficients.<ref name=\"Rogers 1988 555\u2013594\"/>\n*The theory seemed to imply that the audience takes generally passive position. However, the public is not as passive as the theory assumed. Theorist John Fiske has challenged the view of a passive audience.<ref>Fiske, John. \"Television: Polysemy and popularity.\" Critical Studies in Media Communication 3.4 (1986): 391-408.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{divcol|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Availability heuristic]]\n* [[Business communication]]\n* [[Cultivation theory]]\n* [[Digital journalism]]\n* [[Framing effect (psychology)|Framing effect]]\n* [[Hypodermic needle model]]\n* [[Intertrial priming]]\n* [[Marketing]]\n* [[Mass hysteria]]\n* [[Media bias]]\n* [[Military\u2013industrial\u2013media complex]]\n* [[News values]]\n* [[Overton window]]\n* [[Policy by press release]]\n* [[Political agenda]]\n* [[Politico-media complex]]\n* [[Racial bias in criminal news]]\n* ''[[Schema (psychology)|Schema]]''\n* [[Sensationalism]]\n* [[Sociology]]\n* [[Spin (public relations)|Spin]]\n* [[Yellow journalism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = M. | last2 = Stroud | first2 = N.

The sagas say that the Danish lands were divided into two kingdoms at the time, namely Scania and [[Zealand]]. Scania was ruled by a set of brothers, [[Gu\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r of Sk\u00e5ne|Gu\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r]] and [[Halfdan the Valiant]], sons of a [[Goths|Gothic]] princess called Hervor (or Hild). Hervor's husband was [[Harald the Old]], son of [[Valdar]], son of Roar ([[Hro\u00f0gar]]) of the house of Skj\u00f6ldung ([[Scylding]]).<ref>''Flateyarb\u00f3k'', cited in Elleh\u00f8j (1965), p. 93.</ref> While Gu\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r married \u00c5sa, daughter of the Swedish king [[Ingjaldr hinn illradi|Ingjald Illruler]], Halfdan's queen was Moald Digra, an aunt of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] aristocrat Kinrik (Cynric).<ref>''Saga \u00d3lafs Kon\u00fangs Tryggvasonar'', Vol. 1 (1825). Copenhagen: Popp, Chapter 61, p. 110-1.</ref> According to ''[[Hversu Noregr bygg\u00f0ist]]'' and ''[[Nj\u00e1ls saga]]'' he had a son Ivar, and the same paternity is stated in ''Ynglinga saga'' and ''[[Hervarar saga ok Hei\u00f0reks|Hervarar saga]]''.\n\nHowever, Queen \u00c5sa was not content with the state of things, and therefore incited Gu\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r to kill his brother. Later, she murdered her own husband. The ''Ynglinga saga'' implies that Ivar had to flee Scania after the murder of his father. After the demise of Gu\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r, he however returned home, while \u00c5sa had to flee to her father in Sweden. Ivar hastily gathered an army and approached Sweden to exact revenge on the murderous queen. King Ingjald was at a feast in Raening with his daughter when he heard that Ivar's army was in the neighbourhood. Ingjald and \u00c5sa then committed suicide by burning themselves and their drunk retainers in the feast hall.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/heim/02ynglga.htm ''Heimskringla'', ''Ynglinga saga'', Chapter 43-44]</ref> The ''Ynglinga saga'', ''[[Historia Norwegi\u00e6]]'', ''Hervarar saga'' and ''[[Upplendinga Konungum]]'' tell that Ivar conquered [[Svealand|Svearike]] after [[Ingjald]]'s suicide, and later returned to take Denmark. Apart from the Danish lands, he conquered \"a great deal of [[Saxony|Saxland]], all the East Country (Austrr\u00edki), and a fifth part of England\".<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/heim/02ynglga.htm ''Heimskringa'', ''Ynglinga saga'', Chapter 45]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Ivar.png|thumb|right|350px|Map showing the attributed extent of Ivar Vidfamne's realms. The kingdom of Ivar Vidfamne (outlined in red) and other territories paying him tribute (outlined in purple), as it may be interpreted from the stories about Ivar Vidfamne in the sagas.]]\n \nIn that way Ivar conquered much of Scandinavia and parts of north Germany and England (sometimes specified as [[Northumbria]]), earning the cognomen Vidfamne (Wide-fathoming).<ref>Elleh\u00f8j (1965), p. 92.</ref> Because of his harsh rule, many Swedes fled west and populated [[V\u00e4rmland]] under its king [[Olof Tr\u00e4t\u00e4lja]].<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/heim/02ynglga.htm ''Heimskringa'', ''Ynglinga saga'', Chapter 47]</ref> According to ''Hversu'', ''Njal's saga'', the ''[[Lay of Hyndla]]'' and ''[[S\u00f6gubrot]]'', Ivar had a daughter named [[Au\u00f0r the Deep-Minded (\u00cdvarsd\u00f3ttir)|Au\u00f0r the Deep-Minded]]. ''[[S\u00f6gubrot]]'' depicts Ivar in the first place as king of Sweden. It relates that he gave Au\u00f0r in marriage to king [[Hr\u0153rekr Ringslinger]] of [[Zealand]], in spite of the fact that she wanted to marry Hr\u0153rek's brother [[Helgi the Sharp (Zealand)|Helgi the Sharp]]. Hr\u0153rekr and Au\u00f0r had the son [[Harald Wartooth]]. Through cunning intrigues, Ivar made Hr\u0153rekr kill his brother Helgi, and after this, he attacked and killed Hr\u0153rekr. However, Au\u00f0r arrived with the Zealand army and chased her father Ivar back to Sweden. The following year, Au\u00f0r went to [[Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki]] with her son Harald and many powerful men and married its king [[R\u00e1\u00f0bar\u00f0r]], with Harald's consent but not Ivar's. This was the opportunity for Ivar to conquer Zealand.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100908081803/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Fragment.htm ''S\u00f6gubrot'', Chapter 1-2]</ref>\n\nWhen Ivar learnt that Au\u00f0r had married without his permission, he marshaled a great [[leidang]] from Denmark and Sweden and led the fleet to Gardariki to attack R\u00e1\u00f0bar\u00f0r. He was very old at the time. However, when they had arrived at the borders of Ra\u00f0bar\u00f0's kingdom, [[Karelia]] (''Karj\u00e1labotnar''), he had a strange dream and asked his foster father Hord to interpret it. A discussion ensued that ended in Hord likening the megalomaniac Ivar to the [[Midgard Serpent]]. The furious Ivar threw himself overboard in order to get at Hord, who was standing at the shore, and was never seen again. Hord also disappeared in the waves, and it is implied that he was no else than [[Odin]] in disguise. After Ivar's demise the chiefs of his fleet convened and agreed that they had no feud with R\u00e1\u00f0bar\u00f0r, and sailed back to their own lands. Harald Wartooth then returned to [[Zealand]] and [[Scania]] to assume power over the Danish lands. He subsequently conquered back the territories held by his illustrious grandfather.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100908081803/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Fragment.htm ''S\u00f6gubrot'', Chapter 2-4]</ref>\n\nThe ''Hervarar saga'' does not mention any daughter named Au\u00f0r. Instead it mentions an Alfhild in the same genealogical position. Ivar gave her to [[Valdar]] whom Ivar made subking of Denmark, and she gave birth to Harald Wartooth and [[Randver]], father of [[Sigurd Ring]]. In the ''[[Lay of Hyndla]]'', dated to the 12th century, Ivar, Au\u00f0r, Hr\u0153rekr and Harald appear. Ra\u00f0bar\u00f0r also appears, but there is no information about his relationship with them. Strangely, the comprehensive Danish chronicle of [[Saxo Grammaticus]] does not mention Ivar Vidfamne, and rather makes Harald Wartooth the son of a Halfdan, himself the son of a Scanian chief called Borkar.<ref>Nerman (1925), p. 246.</ref>\n\n==Interpretations==\nThe archaeologist [[Birger Nerman]] (1925) argued for the historicity of Ivar and a comprehensive but loosely structured Baltic realm in the late 7th century.<ref>Nerman (1925), p.</ref> This idea has not been pursued by later archaeologists and historians who regard his historical existence as uncertain.<ref>[https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=11998 Gillingstam (1973/75), p. 55]</ref> The story of Gu\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r being murdered by his queen \u00c5sa seems to replicate another story in the ''Ynglinga saga'', about the [[Vestfold]] king [[Gudr\u00f8d the Hunter]] who met a similar fate at the hands of his queen [[\u00c5sa Haraldsdottir of Agder]]. The Viking leader [[Ivar the Boneless]] (d. 870/873) is proposed by Kirsten M\u00f8ller, in the book ''Vikinge\u00e6tten'' from 1997, to be the same person as Ivar Vidfamne. No other writers or scholars seem to have taken up M\u00f8ller's idea.\n\n<small>According to the sagas Ivar Vidfamne was the great great great grandfather of Ivar the Boneless.\nThe family line, that links them, is in some sagas listed as follows: Ivar Vidfamne, daughter Au\u00f0r the Deep-Minded, grandson [[Randver]], great grandson [[Sigurd Hring]], great great grandson [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], great great great grandson - [[Ivar the Boneless]].</small>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Primary sources ==\n*''[[Hervarar saga ok Hei\u00f0reks]]''\n*''[[Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0|Lay of Hyndla]]''\n*''[[S\u00f6gubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum]]''\n*''[[Af Upplendinga konungum]]''\n*''[[Ynglinga saga]]''\n*''[[Nj\u00e1ls saga]]''\n*''[[\u00d3l\u00e1fs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta]]''\n*''[[Heimskringla]]''\n*''[[Norske Kongers Chronica]]''\n*''[[Hversu Noregr bygg\u00f0ist]]''\n*''[[Langfe\u00f0gatal]]''\n*''[[Historia Norwegi\u00e6]]''\n*''[[\u00c1grip af s\u01ebgu Danakonunga]]''\n\n==Secondary sources==\n* Elleh\u00f8j, Svend (1965) ''Studier over de \u00e6ldste norr\u00f8ne historieskrivning''.

The sagas say that the Danish lands were divided into two kingdoms at the time, namely Scania and [[Zealand]]. Scania was ruled by a set of brothers, [[Gu\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r of Sk\u00e5ne|Gu\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r]] and [[Halfdan the Valiant]], sons of a [[Goths|Gothic]] princess called Hervor (or Hild). Hervor's husband was [[Harald the Old]], son of [[Valdar]], son of Roar ([[Hro\u00f0gar]]) of the house of Skj\u00f6ldung ([[Scylding]]).<ref>''Flateyarb\u00f3k'', cited in Elleh\u00f8j (1965), p. 93.</ref> While Gu\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r married \u00c5sa, daughter of the Swedish king [[Ingjaldr hinn illradi|Ingjald Illruler]], Halfdan's queen was Moald Digra, an aunt of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] aristocrat Kinrik (Cynric).<ref>''Saga \u00d3lafs Kon\u00fangs Tryggvasonar'', Vol. 1 (1825). Copenhagen: Popp, Chapter 61, p. 110-1.</ref> According to ''[[Hversu Noregr bygg\u00f0ist]]'' and ''[[Nj\u00e1ls saga]]'' he had a son Ivar, and the same paternity is stated in ''Ynglinga saga'' and ''[[Hervarar saga ok Hei\u00f0reks|Hervarar saga]]''.\n\nHowever, Queen \u00c5sa was not content with the state of things, and therefore incited Gu\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r to kill his brother. Later, she murdered her own husband. The ''Ynglinga saga'' implies that Ivar had to flee Scania after the murder of his father. After the demise of Gu\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r, he however returned home, while \u00c5sa had to flee to her father in Sweden. Ivar hastily gathered an army and approached Sweden to exact revenge on the murderous queen. King Ingjald was at a feast in Raening with his daughter when he heard that Ivar's army was in the neighbourhood. Ingjald and \u00c5sa then committed suicide by burning themselves and their drunk retainers in the feast hall.<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/heim/02ynglga.htm ''Heimskringla'', ''Ynglinga saga'', Chapter 43-44]</ref> The ''Ynglinga saga'', ''[[Historia Norwegi\u00e6]]'', ''Hervarar saga'' and ''[[Upplendinga Konungum]]'' tell that Ivar conquered [[Svealand|Svearike]] after [[Ingjald]]'s suicide, and later returned to take Denmark. Apart from the Danish lands, he conquered \"a great deal of [[Saxony|Saxland]], all the East Country (Austrr\u00edki), and a fifth part of England\".<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/heim/02ynglga.htm ''Heimskringa'', ''Ynglinga saga'', Chapter 45]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Ivar.png|thumb|right|350px|Map showing the attributed extent of Ivar Vidfamne's realms. The kingdom of Ivar Vidfamne (outlined in red) and other territories paying him tribute (outlined in purple), as it may be interpreted from the stories about Ivar Vidfamne in the sagas.]]\n \nIn that way Ivar conquered much of Scandinavia and parts of north Germany and England (sometimes specified as [[Northumbria]]), earning the cognomen Vidfamne (Wide-fathoming).<ref>Elleh\u00f8j (1965), p. 92.</ref> Because of his harsh rule, many Swedes fled west and populated [[V\u00e4rmland]] under its king [[Olof Tr\u00e4t\u00e4lja]].<ref>[https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/heim/02ynglga.htm ''Heimskringa'', ''Ynglinga saga'', Chapter 47]</ref> According to ''Hversu'', ''Njal's saga'', the ''[[Lay of Hyndla]]'' and ''[[S\u00f6gubrot]]'', Ivar had a daughter named [[Au\u00f0r the Deep-Minded (\u00cdvarsd\u00f3ttir)|Au\u00f0r the Deep-Minded]]. ''[[S\u00f6gubrot]]'' depicts Ivar in the first place as king of Sweden. It relates that he gave Au\u00f0r in marriage to king [[Hr\u0153rekr Ringslinger]] of [[Zealand]], in spite of the fact that she wanted to marry Hr\u0153rek's brother [[Helgi the Sharp (Zealand)|Helgi the Sharp]]. Hr\u0153rekr and Au\u00f0r had the son [[Harald Wartooth]]. Through cunning intrigues, Ivar made Hr\u0153rekr kill his brother Helgi, and after this, he attacked and killed Hr\u0153rekr. However, Au\u00f0r arrived with the Zealand army and chased her father Ivar back to Sweden. The following year, Au\u00f0r went to [[Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki]] with her son Harald and many powerful men and married its king [[R\u00e1\u00f0bar\u00f0r]], with Harald's consent but not Ivar's. This was the opportunity for Ivar to conquer Zealand.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100908081803/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Fragment.htm ''S\u00f6gubrot'', Chapter 1-2]</ref>\n\nWhen Ivar learnt that Au\u00f0r had married without his permission, he marshaled a great [[leidang]] from Denmark and Sweden and led the fleet to Gardariki to attack R\u00e1\u00f0bar\u00f0r. He was very old at the time. However, when they had arrived at the borders of Ra\u00f0bar\u00f0's kingdom, [[Karelia]] (''Karj\u00e1labotnar''), he had a strange dream and asked his foster father Hord to interpret it. A discussion ensued that ended in Hord likening the megalomaniac Ivar to the [[Midgard Serpent]]. The furious Ivar threw himself overboard in order to get at Hord, who was standing at the shore, and was never seen again. Hord also disappeared in the waves, and it is implied that he was no else than [[Odin]] in disguise. After Ivar's demise the chiefs of his fleet convened and agreed that they had no feud with R\u00e1\u00f0bar\u00f0r, and sailed back to their own lands. Harald Wartooth then returned to [[Zealand]] and [[Scania]] to assume power over the Danish lands. He subsequently conquered back the territories held by his illustrious grandfather.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100908081803/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/Fragment.htm ''S\u00f6gubrot'', Chapter 2-4]</ref>\n\nThe ''Hervarar saga'' does not mention any daughter named Au\u00f0r. Instead it mentions an Alfhild in the same genealogical position. Ivar gave her to [[Valdar]] whom Ivar made subking of Denmark, and she gave birth to Harald Wartooth and [[Randver]], father of [[Sigurd Ring]]. In the ''[[Lay of Hyndla]]'', dated to the 12th century, Ivar, Au\u00f0r, Hr\u0153rekr and Harald appear. Ra\u00f0bar\u00f0r also appears, but there is no information about his relationship with them. Strangely, the comprehensive Danish chronicle of [[Saxo Grammaticus]] does not mention Ivar Vidfamne, and rather makes Harald Wartooth the son of a Halfdan, himself the son of a Scanian chief called Borkar.<ref>Nerman (1925), p. 246.</ref>\n\n==Interpretations==\nThe archaeologist [[Birger Nerman]] (1925) argued for the historicity of Ivar and a comprehensive but loosely structured Baltic realm in the late 7th century.<ref>Nerman (1925), p.</ref> This idea has not been pursued by later archaeologist and historians who regard his historical existence as uncertain.<ref>[https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=11998 Gillingstam (1973/75), p. 55]</ref> The story of Gu\u00f0r\u00f6\u00f0r being murdered by his queen \u00c5sa seems to replicate another story in the ''Ynglinga saga'', about the [[Vestfold]] king [[Gudr\u00f8d the Hunter]] who met a similar fate at the hands of his queen [[\u00c5sa Haraldsdottir of Agder]]. The Viking leader [[Ivar the Boneless]] (d. 870/873) is proposed by Kirsten M\u00f8ller, in the book ''Vikinge\u00e6tten'' from 1997, to be the same person as Ivar Vidfamne. No other writers or scholars seem to have taken up M\u00f8ller's idea.\n\n<small>According to the sagas Ivar Vidfamne was the great great great grandfather of Ivar the Boneless.\nThe family line, that links them, is in some sagas listed as follows: Ivar Vidfamne, daughter Au\u00f0r the Deep-Minded, grandson [[Randver]], great grandson [[Sigurd Hring]], great great grandson [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], great great great grandson - [[Ivar the Boneless]].</small>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Primary sources ==\n*''[[Hervarar saga ok Hei\u00f0reks]]''\n*''[[Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0|Lay of Hyndla]]''\n*''[[S\u00f6gubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum]]''\n*''[[Af Upplendinga konungum]]''\n*''[[Ynglinga saga]]''\n*''[[Nj\u00e1ls saga]]''\n*''[[\u00d3l\u00e1fs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta]]''\n*''[[Heimskringla]]''\n*''[[Norske Kongers Chronica]]''\n*''[[Hversu Noregr bygg\u00f0ist]]''\n*''[[Langfe\u00f0gatal]]''\n*''[[Historia Norwegi\u00e6]]''\n*''[[\u00c1grip af s\u01ebgu Danakonunga]]''\n\n==Secondary sources==\n* Elleh\u00f8j, Svend (1965) ''Studier over de \u00e6ldste norr\u00f8ne historieskrivning''.
