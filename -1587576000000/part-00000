The U.S. prosecutors claimed the accused were writing down number codes received from Atenci\u00f3n, using Sony hand-held shortwave receivers, and typing the numbers into [[laptop]] computers to decode spying instructions. The FBI testified that they had entered a spy's apartment in 1995, and copied the computer decryption program for the Atenci\u00f3n numbers code.

Transmissions usually begin on the hour or half-hour.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe prelude, introduction, or call-up of a transmission (from which stations' informal nicknames are often derived) includes some kind of identifier,<ref name=\"Numbers Stations\">{{cite web |url=https://www.numbers-stations.com/ns/ |title=Intro to Numbers Stations |access-date=12 March 2016 |publisher=NSRIC |df=dmy-all}}</ref> for the station itself, the intended recipient, or both. This can take the form of numeric or [[spelling alphabet|radio-alphabet]] \"code names\" (e.g. \"Charlie India Oscar\", \"250 250 250\", \"Six-Niner-Zero-Oblique-Five-Four\"), characteristic phrases (e.g. \"\u00a1Atenci\u00f3n!\", \"Achtung!\", \"Ready? Ready?\", \"1234567890\"), and sometimes musical or electronic sounds (e.g. \"The Lincolnshire Poacher\", \"Magnetic Fields\"). Sometimes, as in the case of radio-alphabet stations, the prelude can also signify the nature or priority of the message to follow (e.g., it may indicate that no message follows). Often the prelude repeats for a period before the body of the message begins.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAfter the prelude, there is usually an announcement of the number of number-groups in the message,<ref name=\"Numbers Stations\" /> the page to be used from the one-time pad, or other pertinent information. The groups are then recited. Groups are usually either four or five digits or radio-alphabet letters. The groups are typically repeated, either by reading each group twice or by repeating the entire message as a whole.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nSome stations send more than one message during a transmission. In this case, some or all of the above process is repeated, with different contents.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nFinally, after all the messages have been sent, the station will sign off in some characteristic fashion. Usually, it will simply be some form of the word \"end\" in whatever language the station uses (e.g., \"End of message; End of transmission\", \"Ende\", \"Fini\", \"Final\", \"\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\"). Some stations, especially those thought to originate from the former Soviet Union, end with a series of zeros, e.g., \"00000\" \"000 000\"; others end with music or other sounds.<ref name=\"Numbers Stations\" />\n\nBecause of the secretive nature of the messages, the [[cryptography|cryptographic function]] employed by particular stations is not publicly known, except in one (or possibly two<ref>In the possible case, the underlying type of encryption might have been stated in the court record of the Atenci\u00f3n case when the secretly copied decryption software was introduced into evidence.</ref>) cases. It is assumed that most stations use a one-time pad that would make the contents of these number groups indistinguishable from randomly generated numbers or digits. In one confirmed case, West Germany did use a one-time pad for numbers transmissions.<ref>See [http://radio-weblogs.com/0101986/stories/2002/12/08/ifItHadNotBeenFor15MinutesChapter7.html If It Had Not Been For 15 Minutes, Chapter 7] for a simplified explanation of decoding West German numbers messages without a computer.</ref>\n\n== Transmission technology ==\nAlthough few numbers stations have been tracked down by location, the technology used to transmit the numbers has historically been clear\u2014stock shortwave [[transmitter]]s using powers from 10{{nbsp}}kW to 100{{nbsp}}kW.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n[[Amplitude modulation|Amplitude modulated]] (AM) transmitters with optionally\u2013variable frequency, using [[Class-C amplifier|class-C]] power output stages with [[radio transmitter design#Plate AM modulators|plate modulation]], are the workhorses of international shortwave broadcasting, including numbers stations.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nApplication of [[Spectrum analyzer|spectrum analysis]] to numbers station signals has revealed the presence of data bursts, [[radioteletype]]-modulated [[subcarrier]]s, [[Phase-shift keying|phase-shifted carriers]], and other unusual transmitter modulations like [[Multiple frequency-shift keying|polytones]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Schimmel |first=Donald W. |title=The Underground Frequency Guide: A Directory of Unusual, Illegal, and Covert Radio Communications |edition=3 |location=Solana Beach, California |publisher=High Text Publications, Inc. |year=1994 |isbn=1-878707-17-5 |pages=27\u201328}}</ref> (RTTY-modulated subcarriers were also present on some U.S. commercial radio transmissions during the Cold War.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Collins |first=Barry W. |title=The day the U.S. Army invaded W4TLV |journal=QST |volume=81 |pages=48\u201349 |date=July 1997 |issn=0033-4812}}</ref>)\n\nThe frequently reported use of high-tech modulations like [[burst transmission|data bursts]], in combination or in sequence with spoken numbers, suggests varying transmissions for differing intelligence operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cvni.net/radio/nsnl/nsnl015/nsnl15vs.html |title=NSNL 15: Voice stations |publisher=Cvni.net |date=3 July 1999 |accessdate=26 August 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Sprach-Morse-Generator.jpg|thumb|Speech/Morse generator]]\n\nFor spies in the field, low-tech spoken number transmissions continue to have advantages in the 21st century.

The apparent target zone for the Lincolnshire Poacher signals originating in Cyprus was the Middle East, not the Far East, which is covered by its sister station, E03a [[Cherry Ripe (numbers station)|Cherry Ripe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://priyom.org/number-stations/english/e03a|title=E03a|website=Priyom.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-17}}</ref><ref name=\"karoo514\">{{cite web |url=http://www.simonmason.karoo.net/page514.htm |title=Secret Signals |publisher=Simonmason.karoo.net |accessdate=7 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 September 2006, amateur radio transmissions in the 30&nbsp;m band were affected by an English-language S06 \"Russian Man\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://priyom.org/number-stations/slavic/s06 |title=S06|website=Priyom.org |language=en |access-date=2017-06-17}}</ref> numbers station at 17:40 UTC.<ref name=\"karoo514\" />\n\nIn October 1990, it was reported that a numbers station had been interfering with communications on 6577&nbsp;kHz, a frequency used by air traffic in the Caribbean. The interference was such that on at least one monitored transmission, it blocked the channel entirely and forced the air traffic controller to switch the pilot to an alternative frequency.<ref name=\"karoo514\" />\n\nA [[BBC]] frequency, 7325&nbsp;kHz, has also been used. This prompted a letter to the BBC from a listener in [[Andorra]]. She wrote to the [[BBC World Service|World Service]] ''[[Waveguide]]'' programme in 1983 complaining that her listening had been spoiled by a female voice reading out numbers in English and asked the announcer what this interference was. The BBC presenter laughed at the suggestion of spy activity. He had consulted the experts at [[Bush House]] (BBC World Service headquarters), who declared that the voice was reading out nothing more sinister than snowfall figures for the ski slopes near the listener's home. After more research into this case, shortwave enthusiasts are fairly sure that this was a numbers station being broadcast on a random frequency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.simonmason.karoo.net/page34.html |title=Secret Signals |publisher=Simonmason.karoo.net |accessdate=26 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220145145/http://www.simonmason.karoo.net/page34.html |archive-date=20 February 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Cuban numbers station \"HM01\" has been known to interfere with shortwave broadcaster Voice of Welt on 11530&nbsp;kHz.<ref>{{Citation|last=Anthony Spinelli|title=HM01 and Voice of Welt 11530 AM 10 18 2018 1743z|date=2018-10-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgzyVNGdbzM|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Attempted jamming ===\nNumbers station transmissions have often been the target of intentional jamming attempts. Despite this targeting, many numbers stations continue to broadcast unhindered. Historical examples of jamming include the E10 (a numbers station thought to originate from Israel's Mossad intelligence agency) being jammed by the \"Chinese Music Station\" (thought to originate from the People's Republic of China (PRC) and usually used to jam [[Taiwan]] \"Sound Of Hope\" radio broadcasts which are anti-PRC in nature).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swldxer.co.uk/yhf-dec06.wma |title=Chinese Music Station |format=Windows Media Audio |accessdate=16 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308232621/http://www.swldxer.co.uk/yhf-dec06.wma |archive-date=8 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Classification ==\nAlthough many numbers stations have nicknames which usually describe some aspect of the station itself, these nicknames have sometimes led to confusion among listeners, particularly when discussing stations with similar traits.

It was the centrepiece of a United States federal court espionage trial, following the arrest of the [[Wasp Network]] of Cuban spies in 1998. The U.S. prosecutors claimed the accused were writing down number codes received from Atenci\u00f3n, using Sony hand-held shortwave receivers, and typing the numbers into [[laptop]] computers to decode spying instructions. The FBI testified that they had entered a spy's apartment in 1995, and copied the computer decryption program for the Atenci\u00f3n numbers code. They used it to decode Atenci\u00f3n spy messages, which the prosecutors unveiled in court.<ref name=\"MNT\" />\n\nThe United States government's evidence included the following three examples of decoded Atenci\u00f3n messages.<ref name=\"MNT\" /> (It was not reported whether the original clear texts were in Spanish, although the phrasing of \"Day of the Woman\" would indicate so.)\n* \"prioritize and continue to strengthen friendship with Joe and Dennis\"\n* \"Under no circumstances should [agents] German nor Castor fly with BTTR or another organization on days 24, 25, 26 and 27.\" (BTTR is the anti-Castro airborne group [[Brothers to the Rescue]])\n* \"Congratulate all the female comrades for International Day of the Woman.\" (Probably a simple greeting for [[International Women's Day]] on 8 March)\n\nThe moderator of an e-mail list for global numbers station hobbyists claimed that \"Someone on the Spooks list had already cracked the code for a repeated transmission [from Havana to Miami] if it was received garbled.\" Such code-breaking is possible if a [[one-time pad]] decoding key is used more than once.<ref name=\"MNT\" /> If used properly, however, the code [[One-time pad#Perfect secrecy|cannot be broken]].\n\n== Formats ==\n[[File:Russian Man signoff 2013-04-23.ogg|thumb|The \"Russian Man\" station signing off.

Transmissions usually begin on the hour or half-hour.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe prelude, introduction, or call-up of a transmission (from which stations' informal nicknames are often derived) includes some kind of identifier,<ref name=\"Numbers Stations\">{{cite web |url=https://www.numbers-stations.com/ns/ |title=Intro to Numbers Stations |access-date=12 March 2016 |publisher=NSRIC |df=dmy-all}}</ref> for the station itself, the intended recipient, or both. This can take the form of numeric or [[spelling alphabet|radio-alphabet]] \"code names\" (e.g. \"Charlie India Oscar\", \"250 250 250\", \"Six-Niner-Zero-Oblique-Five-Four\"), characteristic phrases (e.g. \"\u00a1Atenci\u00f3n!\", \"Achtung!\", \"Ready? Ready?\", \"1234567890\"), and sometimes musical or electronic sounds (e.g. \"The Lincolnshire Poacher\", \"Magnetic Fields\"). Sometimes, as in the case of radio-alphabet stations, the prelude can also signify the nature or priority of the message to follow (e.g., it may indicate that no message follows). Often the prelude repeats for a period before the body of the message begins.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAfter the prelude, there is usually an announcement of the number of number-groups in the message,<ref name=\"Numbers Stations\" /> the page to be used from the one-time pad, or other pertinent information. The groups are then recited. Groups are usually either four or five digits or radio-alphabet letters. The groups are typically repeated, either by reading each group twice or by repeating the entire message as a whole.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nSome stations send more than one message during a transmission. In this case, some or all of the above process is repeated, with different contents.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nFinally, after all the messages have been sent, the station will sign off in some characteristic fashion. Usually, it will simply be some form of the word \"end\" in whatever language the station uses (e.g., \"End of message; End of transmission\", \"Ende\", \"Fini\", \"Final\", \"\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\"). Some stations, especially those thought to originate from the former Soviet Union, end with a series of zeros, e.g., \"00000\" \"000 000\"; others end with music or other sounds.<ref name=\"Numbers Stations\" />\n\nBecause of the secretive nature of the messages, the [[cryptography|cryptographic function]] employed by particular stations is not publicly known, except in one (or possibly two<ref>In the possible case, the underlying type of encryption might have been stated in the court record of the Atenci\u00f3n case when the secretly copied decryption software was introduced into evidence.</ref>) cases.

He had consulted the experts at [[Bush House]] (BBC World Service headquarters), who declared that the voice was reading out nothing more sinister than snowfall figures for the ski slopes near the listener's home. After more research into this case, shortwave enthusiasts are fairly sure that this was a numbers station being broadcast on a random frequency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.simonmason.karoo.net/page34.html |title=Secret Signals |publisher=Simonmason.karoo.net |accessdate=26 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220145145/http://www.simonmason.karoo.net/page34.html |archive-date=20 February 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Cuban numbers station \"HM01\" has been known to interfere with shortwave broadcaster Voice of Welt on 11530&nbsp;kHz.<ref>{{Citation|last=Anthony Spinelli|title=HM01 and Voice of Welt 11530 AM 10 18 2018 1743z|date=2018-10-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgzyVNGdbzM|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Attempted jamming ===\nNumbers station transmissions have often been the target of intentional jamming attempts. Despite this targeting, many numbers stations continue to broadcast unhindered. Historical examples of jamming include the E10 (a numbers station thought to originate from Israel's Mossad intelligence agency) being jammed by the \"Chinese Music Station\" (thought to originate from the People's Republic of China (PRC) and usually used to jam [[Taiwan]] \"Sound Of Hope\" radio broadcasts which are anti-PRC in nature).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swldxer.co.uk/yhf-dec06.wma |title=Chinese Music Station |format=Windows Media Audio |accessdate=16 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308232621/http://www.swldxer.co.uk/yhf-dec06.wma |archive-date=8 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Classification ==\nAlthough many numbers stations have nicknames which usually describe some aspect of the station itself, these nicknames have sometimes led to confusion among listeners, particularly when discussing stations with similar traits.

Their [[common name]] '''velvet ant''' refers to their dense pile of hair, which most often is bright scarlet or orange, but may also be black, white, silver, or gold. Their bright colors serve as [[aposematic]] signals. They are known for their extremely painful [[stinger|sting]]s, (the sting of the species ''[[Dasymutilla klugii]]'' rated a 3 on the [[Schmidt sting pain index|Schmidt pain index]] and lasts up to 30 minutes),<ref name=\"prev1\" /> hence the common name '''cow killer''' or '''cow ant'''. However, mutillids are not aggressive and sting only in defense. In addition, the actual toxicity of their venom is much lower than that of honey bees or harvester ants.<ref name=\"prev2\" /> Unlike true [[ant]]s, they are solitary, and lack complex social systems.<ref name=\"j5\" />\n\n== Distribution ==\nMutillidae can be found worldwide with approximately 230 genera or subgenera and around 8,000 species worldwide. Over 400 species occur in the North American southwest.<ref name=\"prev3\"  />\n\n==Description==\nThe exoskeleton of all velvet ants is unusually tough (to the point that some entomologists have reported difficulty piercing them with steel pins when attempting to mount them for display in cabinets).{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} This characteristic allows them to successfully invade the nests of their prey and also helps them retain moisture. Mutillids exhibit extreme [[sexual dimorphism]]. Like some related families in the [[Vespoidea]], males have wings, but females are wingless.  The males and females are so distinct in their [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] that entomologists often find it very hard to determine whether a given male and female belong to the same species, unless they are captured while mating.<ref name=\"prev4\" /> In some species, the male carries the smaller female aloft while mating, which is also seen in the related family [[Thynnidae]].\n \n[[Image:velvet ant 9118.JPG|thumb|200px|A female [[Dasymutilla occidentalis|eastern velvet ant]]]]\nAs is the case for all [[Aculeata|Aculeates]], only female mutillids are capable of inflicting a sting. The stinger is a modified female organ called an [[ovipositor]], which is unusually long and maneuverable in mutillids. In both sexes, a structure called a [[Stridulation|stridulitrum]] on the [[metasoma]] is used to produce a squeaking or chirping sound when alarmed. Both sexes of mutillids also bear hair-lined grooves on the side of the [[metasoma]] called felt lines. Only two other vespoid families, ([[Bradynobaenidae]] and [[Chyphotidae]]) have felt lines, but the females of these families have a distinct [[pronotum]], with a transverse suture separating it from the [[mesonotum]]; in female mutillids, these two thoracic segments are completely fused. Members of the family [[Myrmosidae]], formerly classified as a subfamily of mutillids, also have a distinct pronotum in females, but lack felt lines in both sexes.\n\n==Behavior==\nAdult mutillids feed on [[nectar]]. Although some species are strictly nocturnal, females are often active during the day. Females of ''[[Tricholabiodes thisbe]]'' are sometimes active up to two hours before sunset. Guido Nonveiller (1963) hypothesized the Mutillidae are generally [[stenothermic]] and [[thermophilic]]; they may not avoid light, but rather are active during temperatures that usually occur only after sunset.\n\n==Defense mechanisms==\nPredation is one of the strongest forces natural selection uses to drive the evolution of an organism\u2019s morphology, physiology, and behavior.<ref name=\"j6\" /><ref name=\"j7\" /><ref name=\"j10\" />  During this coevolution, the prey either being consumed by the predator or escaping has resulted in a plethora of impressive defensive strategies in prey species to improve the likelihood of escape. Velvet ants avoid predation using the following defense mechanisms; a venomous sting (if female), [[aposematic coloration]], a [[stridulatory organ]] in their abdomen, an alarm secretion from their mandibular gland, and a durable exoskeleton.\n\nThe venom that velvet ants inject through their stinger has an unknown composition. According to one researcher, the painfulness of the sting of ''Dasymutilla klugii'' outscored 58 other species of stinging insects tested; the only species this researcher rated as having a more painful sting were the ''[[Paraponera clavata]]'' (bullet ant), ''[[Synoeca septentrionalis]]'' (warrior wasp), ''[[Tarantula hawk|Pepsis]]'' spp. and ''[[Tarantula hawk|Hemipepsis]]'' spp. (tarantula hawks).<ref name=\"j12\" /> During the lizard trials of the Gall et al. experiment, only two lizards (one [[whiptail]]{{disambiguation needed|date=December 2018}} and one [[side-blotched lizard]]) attacked a velvet ant it was exposed to.<ref name=\"j4\" /> In both cases the velvet ants were exhibiting rapid lateral and vertical movements to prevent an attack. Once the attack occurred the velvet ants would immediately sting the lizards. This sting resulted in the dropping of the ants in both cases and avoidance for the remainder of the trial.<ref name=\"j4\" /> The side-blotched lizard was found dead in its tank 24 hours later.<ref name=\"j4\" /> The side-blotched lizard is a natural predator to the velvet ant, while the whiptail is not.<ref name=\"j13\" /> To test the aposematic coloration on birds, mealworms were painted to resemble a velvet ant. During these trials, none of the painted mealworms were consumed, while all the control mealworms were consumed immediately.<ref name=\"j4\" /> However, the painted mealworms were attacked by the birds, but the birds immediately ceased the attack.<ref name=\"j4\" /> These experiments provide evidence that the aposematic coloration of velvet ants causes their predators to hesitate, acting as a visual defense mechanism.\n\nThe aposematic coloration of velvet ants often corresponds to a specific [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]] ring consisting of dozens of species.<ref name=\"j14\" /> This offers protection because many predators have learned to avoid prey with this same coloration. American Mutillidae have eight extensive and distinct mimicry rings making up one of the largest M\u00fcllerian mimicry complexes on the planet.<ref name=\"j14\" />\n\nThe stridulatory organ that velvet ants possess produces an audible squeaking when the abdomen is contracted.<ref name=\"j11\" /> This mechanism is an auditory cue warning predators that are about to attack to stay away. In [[shrews]], every time they would get within 1 meter of a velvet ant, the velvet ant would begin stridulating.<ref name=\"j4\" /> Stridulations became more frequent as the predator moved closer to the velvet ant, and the shrew never attempted to attack the velvet ant. However, different scenarios with shrews have shown that the velvet ant would also stridulate after the shrew attacked it. Every time this occurred the shrew dropped the ant.<ref name=\"j4\" />\n\nThe exoskeleton of the velvet ant is remarkably strong.

Their [[common name]] '''velvet ant''' refers to their dense pile of hair, which most often is bright scarlet or orange, but may also be black, white, silver, or gold. Their bright colors serve as [[aposematic]] signals. They are known for their extremely painful [[stinger|sting]]s, (the sting of the species ''[[Dasymutilla klugii]]'' rated a 3 on the [[Schmidt sting pain index|Schmidt pain index]] and lasts up to 30 minutes),<ref name=\"prev1\" /> hence the common name '''cow killer''' or '''cow ant'''. However, mutillids are not aggressive and sting only in defense. In addition, the actual toxicity of their venom is much lower than that of honey bees or harvester ants.<ref name=\"prev2\" /> Unlike true [[ant]]s, they are solitary, and lack complex social systems.<ref name=\"j5\" />\n\n== Distribution ==\nMutillidae can be found worldwide with approximately 230 genera or subgenera and around 8,000 species worldwide. Over 400 species occur in the North American southwest.<ref name=\"prev3\"  />\n\n==Description==\nThe exoskeleton of all velvet ants is unusually tough (to the point that some entomologists have reported difficulty piercing them with steel pins when attempting to mount them for display in cabinets).{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} This characteristic allows them to successfully invade the nests of their prey and also helps them retain moisture. Mutillids exhibit extreme [[sexual dimorphism]]. Like some related families in the [[Vespoidea]], males have wings, but females are wingless.  The males and females are so distinct in their [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] that entomologists often find it very hard to determine whether a given male and female belong to the same species, unless they are captured while mating.<ref name=\"prev4\" /> In some species, the male carries the smaller female aloft while mating, which is also seen in the related family [[Thynnidae]].\n \n[[Image:velvet ant 9118.JPG|thumb|200px|A female [[Dasymutilla occidentalis|eastern velvet ant]]]]\nAs is the case for all [[Aculeata|Aculeates]], only female mutillids are capable of inflicting a sting. The stinger is a modified female organ called an [[ovipositor]], which is unusually long and maneuverable in mutillids. In both sexes, a structure called a [[Stridulation|stridulitrum]] on the [[metasoma]] is used to produce a squeaking or chirping sound when alarmed. Both sexes of mutillids also bear hair-lined grooves on the side of the [[metasoma]] called felt lines. Only two other vespoid families, ([[Bradynobaenidae]] and [[Chyphotidae]]) have felt lines, but the females of these families have a distinct [[pronotum]], with a transverse suture separating it from the [[mesonotum]]; in female mutillids, these two thoracic segments are completely fused. Members of the family [[Myrmosidae]], formerly classified as a subfamily of mutillids, also have a distinct pronotum in females, but lack felt lines in both sexes.\n\n==Behavior==\nAdult mutillids feed on [[nectar]]. Although some species are strictly nocturnal, females are often active during the day. Females of ''[[Tricholabiodes thisbe]]'' are sometimes active up to two hours before sunset. Guido Nonveiller (1963) hypothesized the Mutillidae are generally [[stenothermic]] and [[thermophilic]]; they may not avoid light, but rather are active during temperatures that usually occur only after sunset.\n\n==Defense mechanisms==\nPredation is one of the strongest forces natural selection uses to drive the evolution of an organism\u2019s morphology, physiology, and behavior.<ref name=\"j6\" /><ref name=\"j7\" /><ref name=\"j10\" />  During this coevolution, the prey either being consumed by the predator or escaping has resulted in a plethora of impressive defensive strategies in prey species to improve the likelihood of escape. Velvet ants avoid predation using the following defense mechanisms; a venomous sting (if female), [[aposematic coloration]], a [[stridulatory organ]] in their abdomen, an alarm secretion from their mandibular gland, and a durable exoskeleton.\n\nThe venom that velvet ants inject through their stinger has an unknown composition. According to one researcher, the painfulness of the sting of ''Dasymutilla occidentalis'' outscored 58 other species of stinging insects tested; the only species this researcher rated as having a more painful sting were the ''[[Paraponera clavata]]'' (bullet ant), ''[[Synoeca septentrionalis]]'' (warrior wasp), ''[[Tarantula hawk|Pepsis]]'' spp. and ''[[Tarantula hawk|Hemipepsis]]'' spp. (tarantula hawks).<ref name=\"j12\" /> During the lizard trials of the Gall et al. experiment, only two lizards (one [[whiptail]]{{disambiguation needed|date=December 2018}} and one [[side-blotched lizard]]) attacked a velvet ant it was exposed to.<ref name=\"j4\" /> In both cases the velvet ants were exhibiting rapid lateral and vertical movements to prevent an attack. Once the attack occurred the velvet ants would immediately sting the lizards. This sting resulted in the dropping of the ants in both cases and avoidance for the remainder of the trial.<ref name=\"j4\" /> The side-blotched lizard was found dead in its tank 24 hours later.<ref name=\"j4\" /> The side-blotched lizard is a natural predator to the velvet ant, while the whiptail is not.<ref name=\"j13\" /> To test the aposematic coloration on birds, mealworms were painted to resemble a velvet ant. During these trials, none of the painted mealworms were consumed, while all the control mealworms were consumed immediately.<ref name=\"j4\" /> However, the painted mealworms were attacked by the birds, but the birds immediately ceased the attack.<ref name=\"j4\" /> These experiments provide evidence that the aposematic coloration of velvet ants causes their predators to hesitate, acting as a visual defense mechanism.\n\nThe aposematic coloration of velvet ants often corresponds to a specific [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]] ring consisting of dozens of species.<ref name=\"j14\" /> This offers protection because many predators have learned to avoid prey with this same coloration. American Mutillidae have eight extensive and distinct mimicry rings making up one of the largest M\u00fcllerian mimicry complexes on the planet.<ref name=\"j14\" />\n\nThe stridulatory organ that velvet ants possess produces an audible squeaking when the abdomen is contracted.<ref name=\"j11\" /> This mechanism is an auditory cue warning predators that are about to attack to stay away. In [[shrews]], every time they would get within 1 meter of a velvet ant, the velvet ant would begin stridulating.<ref name=\"j4\" /> Stridulations became more frequent as the predator moved closer to the velvet ant, and the shrew never attempted to attack the velvet ant. However, different scenarios with shrews have shown that the velvet ant would also stridulate after the shrew attacked it. Every time this occurred the shrew dropped the ant.<ref name=\"j4\" />\n\nThe exoskeleton of the velvet ant is remarkably strong. When compared to the exoskeleton of a honeybee, the velvet ant\u2019s required 11 times more force to crush using a force transducer.<ref name=\"j11\" /> As well as being durable, the exoskeleton is also round, making it more difficult for predators to pierce it with attempted stings or bites. During all the trials that led to the fracture of a velvet ant\u2019s exoskeleton, a total of 4 times, resulted in the death of that velvet ant within 24 hours. Aside from protection from predators, the exoskeleton also serves a function in maintaining moisture control.<ref name=\"j11\" />\n\n== Life cycle ==\n[[File:Nemka viduata viduata - 2012-10-17.webm|left|thumb|thumbtime=1:47|A female of ''Nemka viduata viduata'' (Pallas, 1773) looks for a nest of ''Bembix oculata'' to deposit her eggs.]]\nMale mutillids fly in search of females; after mating, the female enters a host insect nest, typically a ground-nesting bee or wasp burrow, and deposits one egg near each [[larva]] or [[pupa]].

The Big T Cattle Company, angry with Earp for trying to clean up Dodge City and reduce business from the cowboys, enlists Kelley's help in arranging an ambush of Earp.

[[John Milford]] appeared in eight episodes as the historical [[Ike Clanton]]. In seven episodes in 1959 and 1961, [[Carol Thurston]] played the fictitious Emma Clanton, daughter of Old Man Clanton and an unlikely romantic interest for Earp. Thurston also was cast in different roles in four earlier episodes before she landed the continuing role as Emma Clanton. [[James Seay]] was cast 16 times as Judge Spicer, who became a close friend of Earp's.\n\n[[William Phipps (actor)|William Phipps]] in 16 episodes played the gunman and rustler [[William Brocius|Curly Bill Brocius]].

[[John Milford]] appeared in eight episodes as the historical [[Ike Clanton]]. In seven episodes in 1959 and 1961, [[Carol Thurston]] played the fictitious Emma Clanton, daughter of Old Man Clanton and an unlikely romantic interest for Earp. Thurston also was cast in different roles in four earlier episodes before she landed the continuing role as Emma Clanton. [[James Seay]] was cast 16 times as Judge Spicer, who became a close friend of Earp's.\n\n[[William Phipps (actor)|William Phipps]] in 16 episodes played the gunman and rustler [[William Brocius|Curly Bill Brocius]]. In the episode \"The Clantons' Family Row\", Brocius is facing a potential gunfight with [[Johnny Ringo]] (Peter M.

A town mob demands that Curly Bill be hanged, but Earp places [[dynamite]] under the main street to protect his prisoner until the trial. Earp must defend Curly Bill in court because White accidentally caused Curly Bill's gun to discharge; White signed a statement attesting to the facts prior to his death.

Many episodes show Douglas Fowley as playing the part of Doc Fabrique when he actually is not in the episodes.  O'Flynn was left off the credits most of the time.  In \"Frontier Surgeon\" (January 19, 1960), Dr. Goodfellow must obtain a truce with Marshal Earp, who is apprehending a wounded outlaw. The man will die if moved after surgery, but he does not wait the three days to recuperate out of distrust of Earp and the protection of the $15,000 loot his gang and he have taken from [[Wells Fargo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631786/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_181|title=\"Frontier Surgeon\" (January 19, 1960)|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Coy]] appeared twice on ''The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp'', as Henry Mason in \"The Doctor\" (1960) and as [[Ben Thompson (lawman)|Ben Thompson]] in \"Dodge Is Civilized\" (1959).

He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Bishop of Philadelphia]] in 1819. \n\nConwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. \n\nAlthough he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Francis Kenrick]]. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.\n\n==Early life and priesthood==\nConwell was born about 1748 in [[Moneymore]], [[County Londonderry]], Ireland (present-day [[Northern Ireland]]), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell.{{efn|Earlier sources give Conwell's date of birth as about 1745, but an Irish researcher, Brother Luke of De La Salle Monastery in [[Muine Bheag]], later discovered evidence that it was likely 1748.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}}}{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}} He studied at the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood there in November 1776.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} \n\nConwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=166}} Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Dungannon]] in 1792 or 1793 and [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] in 1794.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} After the death of Archbishop [[Richard O'Reilly]] in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}}\n\n==Bishop of Philadelphia==\n===Ordination===\nMany of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland.{{sfn|MacAuley|1982|pp=342\u2013343}}\n\nThe British government also objected, favoring [[Patrick Curtis]] instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} [[Pope Pius VII]] appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras]]; Conwell chose Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop [[William Poynter]], the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District]], assisted by Fathers [[James Bramston (bishop)|James Bramston]] and [[Joseph Francis Carpue]].{{efn|Although three bishops are typically required for ordination, the Pope may issue a dispensation when co-consecrators are unavailable.{{sfn|Code of Canon Law}} }}{{sfn|Bransom|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}} Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] of Baltimore, whose [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, [[Louis de Barth]]) had turned the job down.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} Part of the delay was logistical\u2014Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province\u2014but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with [[Pennsylvania#Religion|few Catholics]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} \n\nThere was also a significant dispute (known as [[trusteeism]]) over the rights of churches' [[Laity|lay]] trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization.{{sfn|Carey|1978|pp=357\u2013358}} In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|p=368}}\n\n===Hogan schism===\n{{see| William Hogan (priest)}}\n[[File:Old St. Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia was the epicenter of the disputes that overshadowed Conwell's episcopate.]]\nConwell arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on 2 December 1820.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} \n\nThe trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy preceding his arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], approached de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1913|pp=23\u201324}} \n\nAfter only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan was assigned to [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]]. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan's general conduct created tension with Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already moved out of the priests' residence at [[Old St. Joseph's Church]] to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}}\n\nLater that week, Conwell called a meeting of the city's priests and announced that Hogan was suspended.The trustees took Hogan's side, while Conwell condemned the trustees as \"despicable ex-Catholics\" and \"the worst sort of [[Jacobin]]s\".{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91-92}}\n\nIn the meantime, Conwell recalled a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] \u2014 William Vincent Harold, whom his predecessor had dismissed\u2014to assist him.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The St. Mary's trustees had quarreled with Harold in the past, and his recall increased their mistrust of Conwell.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The schism continued as St. Mary's refused to recognize Conwell's authority over them or Hogan, explicitly excluding Conwell from their board and electing Hogan in his place. Since they had rebelled against the Church hierarchy, Conwell declared Hogan [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] in a public statement on 27 May 1821.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=94}}\n\nIn 1822, Conwell showed his support for Harold by appointing him as Vicar General of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} \n\nPhiladelphia mayor [[Robert Wharton (Philadelphia)|Robert Wharton]] presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|pp=357\u2013359}} Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} \n\nThe pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} \n\nThe next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and the complainant was convicted of [[perjury]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} In an 1824 letter to the ''[[National Gazette]],'' Hogan proposed the creation of an \"American Catholic Church\" with more independence from Rome.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}}\n\nBy this time, Hogan had begun to lose the trustees' support.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}} At some point soon thereafter, he left the city  {{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} (later he completely left the Church and became a vehement anti-Catholic propagandist).{{cn}} \n\nIn hopes of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell partially capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church. The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}}\n\n===Recall to Rome===\nThe trustees soon renounced the agreement. When word of the compromise reached the [[Holy See]], the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had had little to do with the compromise, which he blamed on Father [[Michael Hurley (19th-century priest)|Michael Hurley]] and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall.{{efn|Josiah Randall would soon become the father of [[Samuel J.

While forbidden to return to his diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned to Philadelphia.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} \n\nConwell did return to Philadelphia, however, in October of that year, and traveled from there to Baltimore, where the [[Provincial Councils of Baltimore|First Provincial Council of Baltimore]] was in session.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:2013 Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul from across the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 2.jpg|thumb|Conwell is buried in the crypt of the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]] along with most other bishops of Philadelphia.]]\nIn Baltimore, Conwell professed his obedience to Rome and swore he would gladly retire from active governance of his diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} The following year, the Vatican appointed [[Francis Kenrick]] as Conwell's [[coadjutor bishop]] with the right of succession and named him administrator of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell never gave up his titles or his claim to exercise authority in the diocese, and his relationship with Kenrick remained rocky.{{sfn|Barr|2008|p=615}} \n\nHe received permission to resume performing [[liturgy|liturgical]] functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} He lived on for several years, although he lost his sight, preventing him from performing most of his few remaining duties.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\nConwell died on 22 April 1842, at about the age of 94. Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia. Conwell's death led to one final controversy, as the old bishop's nephews and nieces sued for possession of the Bishop's Burial Ground, claiming it had been Conwell's private possession. Under threat of excommunication, they withdrew their claim.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} \n\nConwell's remains were buried in St. Mary's churchyard.

He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Bishop of Philadelphia]] in 1819. \n\nConwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. \n\nAlthough he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Francis Kenrick]]. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.\n\n==Early life and priesthood==\nConwell was born about 1748 in [[Moneymore]], [[County Londonderry]], Ireland (present-day [[Northern Ireland]]), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell.{{efn|Earlier sources give Conwell's date of birth as about 1745, but an Irish researcher, Brother Luke of De La Salle Monastery in [[Muine Bheag]], later discovered evidence that it was likely 1748.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}}}{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}} He studied at the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood there in November 1776.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} \n\nConwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=166}} Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Dungannon]] in 1792 or 1793 and [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] in 1794.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} After the death of Archbishop [[Richard O'Reilly]] in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}}\n\n==Bishop of Philadelphia==\n===Ordination===\nMany of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland.{{sfn|MacAuley|1982|pp=342\u2013343}}\n\nThe British government also objected, favoring [[Patrick Curtis]] instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} [[Pope Pius VII]] appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras]]; Conwell chose Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop [[William Poynter]], the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District]], assisted by Fathers [[James Bramston (bishop)|James Bramston]] and [[Joseph Francis Carpue]].{{efn|Although three bishops are typically required for ordination, the Pope may issue a dispensation when co-consecrators are unavailable.{{sfn|Code of Canon Law}} }}{{sfn|Bransom|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}} Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] of Baltimore, whose [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, [[Louis de Barth]]) had turned the job down.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} Part of the delay was logistical\u2014Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province\u2014but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with [[Pennsylvania#Religion|few Catholics]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} \n\nThere was also a significant dispute (known as [[trusteeism]]) over the rights of churches' [[Laity|lay]] trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization.{{sfn|Carey|1978|pp=357\u2013358}} In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|p=368}}\n\n===Hogan schism===\n{{see| William Hogan (priest)}}\n[[File:Old St. Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia was the epicenter of the disputes that overshadowed Conwell's episcopate.]]\nConwell arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on 2 December 1820.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} \n\nThe trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy preceding his arrival.

Since they had rebelled against the Church hierarchy, Conwell declared Hogan [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] in a public statement on 27 May 1821.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=94}}\n\nIn 1822, Conwell showed his support for Harold by appointing him as Vicar General of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} \n\nPhiladelphia mayor [[Robert Wharton (Philadelphia)|Robert Wharton]] presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|pp=357\u2013359}} Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} \n\nThe pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} \n\nThe next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and the complainant was convicted of [[perjury]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} In an 1824 letter to the ''[[National Gazette]],'' Hogan proposed the creation of an \"American Catholic Church\" with more independence from Rome.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}}\n\nBy this time, Hogan had begun to lose the trustees' support.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}} At some point soon thereafter, he left the city  {{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} (later he completely left the Church and became a vehement anti-Catholic propagandist).{{cn}} \n\nIn hopes of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell partially capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church. The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}}\n\n===Recall to Rome===\nThe trustees soon renounced the agreement. When word of the compromise reached the [[Holy See]], the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had had little to do with the compromise, which he blamed on Father [[Michael Hurley (19th-century priest)|Michael Hurley]] and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall.{{efn|Josiah Randall would soon become the father of [[Samuel J. Randall]], a future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|House|1934|pp=1\u20135}} }}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}}\n\nConwell saw Harold's conduct as a betrayal, and removed him as Vicar General, appointing Hurley in his place.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} The trustees put aside their former enmity for Harold and took his side against Conwell, going so far as to petition Rome for Conwell's removal as bishop.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} By this time, as Arthur Ennis wrote in 1976, the \"old and confused\" Conwell considered leaving the diocese if he could secure another see in Ireland.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} \n\nIn 1827, the Vatican's ''[[Propaganda Fide]]'' formally rejected Conwell's pact with the trustees, condemning Hurley's role in the process, as well.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} They summoned Conwell to Rome.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}}\n\n[[Ambrose Mar\u00e9chal]], who was now Archbishop of Baltimore, was ordered to oversee the diocese in Conwell's absence, and he appointed a priest from his diocese, [[William Matthews (priest)|William Matthews]], as apostolic administrator.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=103}} \n\nConwell sailed for Rome on July 12, 1828.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Once there, Conwell was ordered to give a report of all that had transpired. While forbidden to return to his diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned to Philadelphia.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} \n\nConwell did return to Philadelphia, however, in October of that year, and traveled from there to Baltimore, where the [[Provincial Councils of Baltimore|First Provincial Council of Baltimore]] was in session.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:2013 Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul from across the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 2.jpg|thumb|Conwell is buried in the crypt of the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]] along with most other bishops of Philadelphia.]]\nIn Baltimore, Conwell professed his obedience to Rome and swore he would gladly retire from active governance of his diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} The following year, the Vatican appointed [[Francis Kenrick]] as Conwell's [[coadjutor bishop]] with the right of succession and named him administrator of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell never gave up his titles or his claim to exercise authority in the diocese, and his relationship with Kenrick remained rocky.{{sfn|Barr|2008|p=615}} \n\nHe received permission to resume performing [[liturgy|liturgical]] functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} He lived on for several years, although he lost his sight, preventing him from performing most of his few remaining duties.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\nConwell died on 22 April 1842, at about the age of 94. Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia. Conwell's death led to one final controversy, as the old bishop's nephews and nieces sued for possession of the Bishop's Burial Ground, claiming it had been Conwell's private possession. Under threat of excommunication, they withdrew their claim.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} \n\nConwell's remains were buried in St. Mary's churchyard. In 1864 the remains were transferred to the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]].{{sfn|Luke|1940|p=293}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist | colwidth = 26em | refs = }}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bransom\n  | first = Charles N.\n  | title = Ordinations of U.S. Catholic Bishops, 1790\u20131989\n  | year = 1990\n  | publisher = United States Catholic Conference\n  | location = Washington, D.C.\n  | isbn = 1-55586-323-X\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Ennis\n  | first = Arthur J.\n  | editor-last = Connelly\n  | editor-first = James F.\n  | title = The History of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia\n  | publisher = Unigraphics Incorporated\n  | location = Wynnewood, Pennsylvania\n  | date = 1976\n  | pages = 63\u2013112\n  | chapter = Chapter Two: The New Diocese\n  | oclc = 4192313\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia\n  | last = Loughlin\n  | first = James\n  | title = Henry Conwell\n  | encyclopedia = [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]\n  | publisher = Robert Appleton Company\n  | location = New York\n  | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04349a.htm\n  | year = 1908\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Nolan\n  | first = Hugh J.\n  | editor-last = Connelly\n  | editor-first = James F.\n  | title = The History of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia\n  | publisher = Unigraphics Incorporated\n  | location = Wynnewood, Pennsylvania\n  | date = 1976\n  | pages = 113\u2013208\n  | chapter = Chapter Three: Francis Patrick Kenrick, First Coadjutor-Bishop\n  | oclc = 4192313\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Shea\n  | first = John Gilmary\n  | year = 1886\n  | title = The Hierarchy of the Catholic Church in the United States\n  | publisher = The Office of Catholic Publications\n  | location = New York\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/HierarchyOfTheCatholicChurchUSA\n  | oclc = 8217858\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n\n'''Articles'''\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Barr\n  | first = Colin\n  | title = 'Imperium in Imperio': Irish Episcopal Imperialism in the Nineteenth Century\n  | journal = The English Historical Review\n  | date = June 2008\n  | volume= 123\n  | issue = 502\n  | pages = 611\u2013650\n  | jstor = 20108543\n  | ref = harv\n  | doi=10.1093/ehr/cen161\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Carey\n  | first = Patrick\n  | title = The Laity's Understanding of the Trustee System, 1785\u20131855\n  | journal = The Catholic Historical Review\n  | date = July 1978\n  | volume= 64\n  | issue = 3\n  | pages = 357\u2013376\n  | jstor = 25020365\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Griffin\n  | first = Martin I.J.\n  | title = Life of Bishop Conwell of Philadelphia [part]\n  | journal = Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia\n  | date = 1913\n  | volume= 23\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 16\u201342\n  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=XJdJAAAAYAAJ\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Griffin\n  | first = Martin I.J.\n  | title = Life of Bishop Conwell of Philadelphia [part]\n  | journal = Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia\n  | date = 1915\n  | volume= 26\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 162\u2013178\n  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ShhPAQAAMAAJ\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Hessinger\n  | first = Rodney\n  | title = \"A Base and Unmanly Conspiracy\" Catholicism and the Hogan Schism in the Gendered Religious Marketplace of Philadelphia\n  | journal = Journal of the Early Republic\n  | date = Fall 2011\n  | volume= 31\n  | issue = 3\n  | pages = 357\u2013396\n  | jstor = 41261629\n  | ref = harv\n  | doi=10.1353/jer.2011.0033\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Luke\n  | first = Brother\n  | title = Calendar of the Letters of Rev.
