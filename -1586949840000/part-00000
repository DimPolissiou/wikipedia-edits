[[Malaysia]]. The largest among the 13 states, with an area almost equal to that of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], Sarawak is located in northwest [[Borneo Island]], and is bordered by the Malaysian state of [[Sabah]] to the northeast, [[Kalimantan]] (the Indonesian portion of Borneo) to the south, and [[Brunei]] in the north. The capital city, [[Kuching]], is the largest city in Sarawak, the economic centre of the state,  and the seat of the Sarawak state government. Other cities and towns in Sarawak include [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]], [[Sibu]], and [[Bintulu]]. As of the 2015 census, the population of Sarawak was 2,636,000. Sarawak has an [[equatorial climate]] with tropical [[rainforest]]s and abundant animal and plant species. It has several prominent [[cave]] systems at [[Gunung Mulu National Park]]. [[Rajang River]] is the longest river in Malaysia; [[Bakun Dam]], one of the largest dams in [[Southeast Asia]], is located on one of its tributaries, the [[Balui River]]. [[Mount Murud]] is the highest point in Sarawak.\n\nThe earliest known human settlement in Sarawak at the [[Niah National Park|Niah Caves]] dates back 40,000 years. A series of Chinese ceramics dated from the 8th to 13th century AD was uncovered at the archaeological site of Santubong. The coastal regions of Sarawak came under the influence of the [[Bruneian Empire]] in the 16th century. In 1839, [[James Brooke]], a British explorer, arrived in Sarawak. He, and his descendants, [[Raj of Sarawak|governed]] the state from 1841 to 1946. During [[World War II]], it was [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|occupied by the Japanese]] for three years. After the war, the last [[White Rajah]], [[Charles Vyner Brooke]], ceded Sarawak to Britain, and in 1946 it became a [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|British Crown Colony]]. On 22 July 1963, Sarawak was granted self-government by the British and subsequently became one of the founding members of Malaysia, established on 16 September 1963. However, the federation was opposed by Indonesia leading to a three-year [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation|confrontation]]. The creation of Malaysia also resulted in a [[Sarawak Communist Insurgency|communist insurgency]] that lasted until 1990.\n\nThe head of state is the Governor, also known as the [[Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sarawak|Yang di-Pertua Negeri]], while the head of government is the [[Chief Minister of Sarawak|Chief Minister]]. Sarawak is divided into administrative divisions and districts, governed by a system that is closely modelled on the [[Westminster system|Westminster parliamentary system]] and was the earliest state legislature system in Malaysia.\n\nBecause of its natural resources, Sarawak specialises in the export of oil and gas, [[timber]] and [[oil palm]]s, but also possesses strong manufacturing, energy and tourism sectors. It is ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse; major ethnic groups including Iban, Malay, Chinese, Melanau, Bidayuh and Orang Ulu. English and Malay are the two official languages of the state; there is no official religion.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Buceros rhinoceros -Kuala Lumpur Bird Park, Malaysia-8a (1).jpg|thumbnail|left|The [[rhinoceros hornbill]] is the [[State emblems of Malaysia|state bird]] of Sarawak.|alt=A black bird with white underbelly, white beak and red-orange horn perching on a branch]]\nThe generally-accepted explanation of the state's name is that it is derived from the [[Sarawak Malay]] word ''serawak'', which means [[antimony]].<ref name=\"etymology\">{{cite web|url=http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/list.php?ttl_id=35|title=Origin of Place Names \u2013 Sarawak|publisher=[[National Library of Malaysia]]|year=2000|accessdate=3 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209105740/http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/list.php?ttl_id=35&section=sm03 |archivedate=9 February 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> A popular alternative explanation is that it is a contraction of the four Malay words purportedly uttered by Pangeran Muda Hashim (uncle to the [[Sultan of Brunei]]), \"''Saya serah pada awak''\" (I surrender it to you), when he gave Sarawak to [[James Brooke]], an English explorer in 1841.<ref name=\"etymology\"/>  However, the latter explanation is incorrect: the territory had been named Sarawak before the arrival of James Brooke, and the word ''awak'' was not in the vocabulary of Sarawak Malay before the formation of Malaysia.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kris|first1=Jitab|title=Wrong info on how Sarawak got its name|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1295&dat=19910223&id=xJVUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_o8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6766,1316351&hl=en|accessdate=14 November 2015|publisher=New Sunday Times|date=23 February 1991}}</ref>\n\nSarawak is nicknamed \"Land of the Hornbills\" (''Bumi Kenyalang'').

[[Malaysia]]. The largest among the 13 states, with an area almost equal to that of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], Sarawak is located in northwest [[Borneo Island]], and is bordered by the Malaysian state of [[Sabah]] to the northeast, [[Kalimantan]] (the Indonesian portion of Borneo) to the south, and [[Brunei]] in the north. The capital city, [[Kuching]], is the largest city in Sarawak, the economic centre of the state,  and the seat of the Sarawak state government. Other cities and towns in Sarawak include [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]], [[Sibu]], and [[Bintulu]]. As of the 2015 census, the population of Sarawak was 2,636,000. Sarawak has an [[equatorial climate]] with tropical [[rainforest]]s and abundant animal and plant species. It has several prominent [[cave]] systems at [[Gunung Mulu National Park]]. [[Rajang River]] is the longest river in Malaysia; [[Bakun Dam]], one of the largest dams in [[Southeast Asia]], is located on one of its tributaries, the [[Balui River]]. [[Mount Murud]] is the highest point in Sarawak.\n\nThe earliest known human settlement in Sarawak at the [[Niah National Park|Niah Caves]] dates back 40,000 years. A series of Chinese ceramics dated from the 8th to 13th century AD was uncovered at the archaeological site of Santubong. The coastal regions of Sarawak came under the influence of the [[Bruneian Empire]] in the 16th century. In 1839, [[James Brooke]], a British explorer, arrived in Sarawak. He, and his descendants, [[Raj of Sarawak|governed]] the state from 1841 to 1946. During [[World War II]], it was [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|occupied by the Japanese]] for three years. After the war, the last [[White Rajah]], [[Charles Vyner Brooke]], ceded Sarawak to Britain, and in 1946 it became a [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|British Crown Colony]]. On 22 July 1963, Sarawak was granted self-government by the British and subsequently became one of the founding members of Malaysia, established on 16 September 1963. However, the federation was opposed by Indonesia leading to a three-year [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation|confrontation]]. The creation of Malaysia also resulted in a [[Sarawak Communist Insurgency|communist insurgency]] that lasted until 1990.\n\nThe head of state is the Governor, also known as the [[Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sarawak|Yang di-Pertua Negeri]], while the head of government is the [[Chief Minister of Sarawak|Chief Minister]]. Sarawak is divided into administrative divisions and districts, governed by a system that is closely modelled on the [[Westminster system|Westminster parliamentary system]] and was the earliest state legislature system in Malaysia.\n\nBecause of its natural resources, Sarawak specialises in the export of oil and gas, [[timber]] and [[oil palm]]s, but also possesses strong manufacturing, energy and tourism sectors. It is ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse; major ethnic groups including Iban, Malay, Chinese, Melanau, Bidayuh and Orang Ulu. English and Malay are the two official languages of the state; there is no official religion.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Buceros rhinoceros -Kuala Lumpur Bird Park, Malaysia-8a (1).jpg|thumbnail|left|The [[rhinoceros hornbill]] is the [[State emblems of Malaysia|state bird]] of Sarawak.|alt=A black bird with white underbelly, white beak and red-orange horn perching on a branch]]\nThe generally-accepted explanation of the state's name is that it is derived from the [[Sarawak Malay]] word ''serawak'', which means [[antimony]].<ref name=\"etymology\">{{cite web|url=http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/list.php?ttl_id=35|title=Origin of Place Names \u2013 Sarawak|publisher=[[National Library of Malaysia]]|year=2000|accessdate=3 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209105740/http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/list.php?ttl_id=35&section=sm03 |archivedate=9 February 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> A popular alternative explanation is that it is a contraction of the four Malay words purportedly uttered by Pangeran Muda Hashim (uncle to the [[Sultan of Brunei]]), \"''Saya serah pada awak''\" (I surrender it to you), when he gave Sarawak to [[James Brooke]], an English explorer in 1841.<ref name=\"etymology\"/>  However, the latter explanation is incorrect: the territory had been named Sarawak before the arrival of James Brooke, and the word ''awak'' was not in the vocabulary of Sarawak Malay before the formation of Malaysia.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kris|first1=Jitab|title=Wrong info on how Sarawak got its name|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1295&dat=19910223&id=xJVUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_o8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6766,1316351&hl=en|accessdate=14 November 2015|publisher=New Sunday Times|date=23 February 1991}}</ref>\n\nSarawak is nicknamed \"Land of the Hornbills\" (''Bumi Kenyalang'').

When passenger service to Fresno was reinstated on 5 March 1974 Amtrak used a space in the nearby freight house.

Sante Fe closed the station for passenger service in 1966 and completely shuttered the building in the early 1990s. When passenger service to Fresno was reinstated on 5 March 1974 Amtrak used a space in the nearby freight house. By the time the city of Fresno purchased the station in 2003, it had fallen into disrepair. The station reopened on 12 February 2005 after a {{US$|6 million}} renovation project largely restored it to original 1899 appearance.<ref name=\"GAS FNO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.greatamericanstations.com/Stations/FNO|title=Great American Stations: Fresno, CA (FNO)|website=greatamericanstations.com|publisher=[[Amtrak]]|accessdate=6 Jul 2014}}</ref> After renovations there are now is {{convert|5400|sqft|abbr=on}} dedicated to passenger service and another {{convert|12300|sqft|abbr=on}} available for lease.
