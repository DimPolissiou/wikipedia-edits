In G. garnhami three parts can be seen: epimerite, protomerite en deutomerite, but their visibility depends on the life stage of the organism. A characteristic of gregarins is the typical construction of the pellicula that is formed by a [[Cell membrane]] and two cytoplasmamembranes (the latter is often referred to as the inner membrane complex, IMC or alveoli). The membranes' proximity to one another often makes them difficult to distinguish. This structure is often also referred to as the tri-layered structure. Beneath the inner membrane a [[Basal lamina|basal (internal) lamina]] can be seen. This basal lamina separates the epicytic foldings from the rest of the cell. These epicytic foldings form the outer surface of G. garnhami and hundreds of these can be observed at the surface enlarging the surface of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vivier |first1=E |last2=Petitprez |first2=A |title=The outer membrane complex and its development at the time of the formation of daughter cells in Toxoplasma gondii|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |date=November 1969 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=329\u201342 |doi=10.1083/jcb.43.2.329 |pmid=5344151|pmc=2107857 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=M.

Beneath the inner membrane a [[Basal lamina|basal (internal) lamina]] can be seen. This basal lamina separates the epicytic foldings from the rest of the cell. These epicytic foldings form the outer surface of G. garnhami and hundreds of these can be observed at the surface enlarging the surface of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vivier |first1=E |last2=Petitprez |first2=A |title=The outer membrane complex and its development at the time of the formation of daughter cells in Toxoplasma gondii|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |date=November 1969 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=329\u201342 |doi=10.1083/jcb.43.2.329 |pmid=5344151|pmc=2107857 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=M.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s.

On the 21st January 1739, Koli pirates with some [[Siddi]]s of [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] captured several British vessels, among one of which was the '<nowiki/>''Tiger Gallivat''<nowiki/>'. After a few years in 1749, Koli pirates captured the '''Bengal Ship''<nowiki/>', carrying sixty thousand pounds cash and [[cargo]] worth of equal amount. It was a big shock for the British government, and after that the ''British Navy'' and ''[[Dutch India|Dutch Navy]]'' joined hand together to fight against Koli pirates. In 1750, there was a battle at ''Kurla River'' which resulted in defeat for the Kolis and the capture of 23 armed vessels. After this fight, Koli piracy was silenced for long time. It seems that ''Koli Piracy'' was a headache for all naval powers of India.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Saletore|first=Rajaram Narayan|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=1PVMMoChwY4C&dq=Koli+Pirate&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Indian Pirates|date=1978|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPrincely states of [[Junagadh State|Junagadh]] and [[Bhavnagar State|Bhavnagar]] also suffered Koli piracy.

It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOne of the major uprising of kolis placed in the year of 1729, the kolis of [[Radhanpur]] revolted against the mughals in gujarat.

Kolis of his territory were in revolt wind already against mughals. Kolis infested the roads, blocked the minor ways, plundered the villages and challenged the authority. The first [[Nawab]] of radhanpur Jawan Marad Khan was ordered by sultan to put down the kolis. Khan marched against kolis of ''Balor'' in his territory and happened a critical struggle between nawab and kolis. But nawab was killed in action by the kolis of balor.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra.

The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. According to the historical anthropology [[Susan Bayly]] of [[University of Cambridge]] states that this is the [[Kshatriya]] of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and uppar [[India]]. Until tye 1940, kolis were considered as criminal stocks and mostly used for police and military by rulers and authorities. Some of them engaged in marketing as [[Vaishya]] and a large number engaged in agriculture and as soldier. They have gained prominence from islamic india and were political strong and petty rulers from koli community were vested the titles of [[Thakor]] and [[Girasia]] which means ''Girasdar'' or collector of tax from his territory.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite book|last=Bayly|first=Susan|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=HbAjKR_iHogC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age|date=2001-02-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79842-6|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mughal time, kolis were most notorious for rulers. so a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] chronicler mentioned that the kolis of gujarat raised against mughal rule.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis. There were no difficulties for rebels and ''Govindas Ramdas'' proclaimed himself as ruler (''Koli Thakor)'' of Thasra. <ref name=\":17\">{{Cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Vinayak|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzPlZSOjCpsC&pg=PA90&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Peasant Pasts: History and Memory in Western India|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25076-5|language=en}}</ref> he led the kolis 1826 to 1830 as a ruler.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDuring the ''Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],'' the kolis of [[Nashik district]] in [[Maharashtra]] rebelled in the ''Petty Princely State Of [[Peint]]'' also spelled ''Penth and Peth .'' peint was a [[Jagir]]'' '' of twenty four vilages and ruled by koli king ''Bhagvant Rao'' also knowns as ''Bhargav Rav .''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Koli+Raja+Peint&source=bl&ots=Vf7J9ivfZy&sig=ACfU3U3qQfAfE5epilPBBXeDIE0DOCmSvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit3crjnt_oAhU9H7cAHd_1AcYQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Raja%20Peint&f=false|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|date=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en}}</ref> the rebellion was raised by it's koli chief, queen and her [[Dewan|Diwan]]'' '' in the lead of ''Bhagojee Naik and Bhow Patel Malekar'' (both koli) to collapse the british rule.

As a result, the Americans and other nations where professional baseball is developed relied on collegiate players, while Cubans used their most experienced veterans, who technically were considered amateurs as they nominally held other jobs, but in fact trained full-time. In 2000, pros were admitted, but the MLB refused to release its players in 2000, 2004, and 2008, and the situation changed only a little: the Cubans still used their best players, while the Americans started using minor leaguers. The IOC cited the absence of the best players as the main reason for baseball being dropped from the Olympic program.<ref>https://books.google.ru/books?id=W7Q3DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA305&lpg=PA305&dq=cuba+baseball+shamateurism&source=bl&ots=q8uk7_eQv9&sig=ACfU3U2Y3wZS-S4VMoIuWGt6aBMmyNkXAg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiboq6Dxe3nAhWPw4sKHSozDPYQ6AEwFXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=cuba%20baseball%20shamateurism&f=false</ref><ref name=socog2>{{cite journal|author=Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games |year=2001 |title=Official Report of the XXVII Olympiad |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327000622/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v2.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 March 2009 |publisher=Paragon Printers Australasia |pages=176\u20139 |location=Canberra, Australia |accessdate=15 September 2010 |volume=2: Celebrating the Games |isbn=0-9579616-0-X |format=PDF |ref=refSOCOG }}</ref>\n\n;Summary\n{|class=wikitable style=font-size:90%;text-align:center\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Team\n!rowspan=2|Event\n!colspan=8|Round robin\n!Semifinal\n!colspan=2|Final / {{abbr|BM|Bronze medal game}}\n|-style=font-size:95%\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Rank\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Rank\n|-\n|align=left|[[United States national baseball team|United States men]]\n|align=left|[[Baseball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Men's tournament]]\n|{{bb|ESP}}<br>'''W''' 4\u20131\n|{{bb|TPE}}<br>'''W''' 10\u20139\n|{{bb|ITA}}<br>'''W''' 10\u20130\n|{{bb|CUB}}<br>'''L''' 6\u20139\n|{{bb|PUR|1952}}<br>'''W''' 8\u20132\n|{{bb|DOM}}<br>'''W''' 10\u20130\n|{{bb|JPN|1947}}<br>'''L''' 1\u20137\n|4 '''Q'''\n|{{bb|CUB}}<br>'''L''' 1\u20136\n|''Bronze medal final''<br>{{bb|JPN|1947}}<br>'''L''' 3\u20138\n|4\n|}\n\n*Preliminary Round\n:*4-1 vs [[Spain]]\n:*10-9 vs [[Chinese Taipei]]\n:*10-0 vs [[Italy]]\n:*6-9 vs [[Cuba]]\n:*8-2 vs [[Puerto Rico]]\n:*10-0 vs [[Dominican Republic]]\n:*1-7 vs [[Japan]]\n*Semifinal\n:*1-6 vs [[Cuba]]\n*Bronze Medal Game\n:*3-8 vs [[Japan]]\n\n'''Roster'''\n*[[Willie Adams (1990s pitcher)|Willie Adams]]\n*[[Jeff Alkire]]\n*[[Darren Dreifort]]\n*[[Nomar Garciaparra]]\n*[[Jason Giambi]]\n*[[Rick Greene]]\n*[[Jeffrey Hammonds]]\n*[[Rick Helling]]\n*[[Charles Johnson (catcher)|Charles Johnson]]\n*[[Daron Kirkreit]]\n*[[Chad McConnell]]\n*[[Calvin Murray]]\n*[[Phil Nevin]]\n*[[Chris Roberts (baseball)|Chris Roberts]]\n*[[Michael Tucker (baseball)|Michael Tucker]]\n*[[Jason Varitek]]\n*[[Ron Villone]]\n*[[B.

As a result, the Americans and other nations where professional baseball is developed relied on collegiate players, while Cubans used their most experienced veterans, who technically were considered amateurs as they nominally held other jobs, but in fact trained full-time. In 2000, pros were admitted, but the MLB refused to release its players in 2000, 2004, and 2008, and the situation changed only a little: the Cubans still used their best players, while the Americans started using minor leaguers. The IOC cited the absence of the best players as the main reason for baseball being dropped from the Olympic program.<ref>https://books.google.ru/books?id=W7Q3DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA305&lpg=PA305&dq=cuba+baseball+shamateurism&source=bl&ots=q8uk7_eQv9&sig=ACfU3U2Y3wZS-S4VMoIuWGt6aBMmyNkXAg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiboq6Dxe3nAhWPw4sKHSozDPYQ6AEwFXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=cuba%20baseball%20shamateurism&f=false</ref><ref name=socog2>{{cite journal|author=Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games |year=2001 |title=Official Report of the XXVII Olympiad |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327000622/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v2.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 March 2009 |publisher=Paragon Printers Australasia |pages=176\u20139 |location=Canberra, Australia |accessdate=15 September 2010 |volume=2: Celebrating the Games |isbn=0-9579616-0-X |format=PDF |ref=refSOCOG }}</ref>\n\n;Summary\n{|class=wikitable style=font-size:90%;text-align:center\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Team\n!rowspan=2|Event\n!colspan=8|Round robin\n!Semifinal\n!colspan=2|Final / {{abbr|BM|Bronze medal game}}\n|-style=font-size:95%\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Rank\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Opposition<br>Result\n!Rank\n|-\n|align=left|[[United States national baseball team|United States men]]\n|align=left|[[Baseball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Men's tournament]]\n|{{bb|ESP}}<br>'''W''' 4\u20131\n|{{bb|TPE}}<br>'''W''' 10\u20139\n|{{bb|ITA}}<br>'''W''' 10\u20130\n|{{bb|CUB}}<br>'''L''' 6\u20139\n|{{bb|PUR|1952}}<br>'''W''' 8\u20132\n|{{bb|DOM}}<br>'''W''' 10\u20130\n|{{bb|JPN|1947}}<br>'''L''' 1\u20137\n|4 '''Q'''\n|{{bb|CUB}}<br>'''L''' 1\u20136\n|''Bronze medal final''<br>{{bb|JPN|1947}}<br>'''L''' 3\u20138\n|4\n|}\n\n*Preliminary Round\n:*4-1 vs [[Spain]]\n:*10-9 vs [[Chinese Taipei]]\n:*10-0 vs [[Italy]]\n:*6-9 vs [[Cuba]]\n:*8-2 vs [[Puerto Rico]]\n:*10-0 vs [[Dominican Republic]]\n:*1-7 vs [[Japan]]\n*Semifinal\n:*1-6 vs [[Cuba]]\n*Bronze Medal Game\n:*3-8 vs [[Japan]]\n\n'''Roster'''\n*[[Willie Adams (1990s pitcher)|Willie Adams]]\n*[[Jeff Alkire]]\n*[[Darren Dreifort]]\n*[[Nomar Garciaparra]]\n*[[Jason Giambi]]\n*[[Rick Greene]]\n*[[Jeffrey Hammonds]]\n*[[Rick Helling]]\n*[[Charles Johnson (catcher)|Charles Johnson]]\n*[[Daron Kirkreit]]\n*[[Chad McConnell]]\n*[[Calvin Murray]]\n*[[Phil Nevin]]\n*[[Chris Roberts (baseball)|Chris Roberts]]\n*[[Michael Tucker (baseball)|Michael Tucker]]\n*[[Jason Varitek]]\n*[[Ron Villone]]\n*[[B.

{"title_page": "Ala Younis", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2016}}\n'''Ala Younis''' is a research-based artist and [[curator]], based in Amman. Younis initiates journeys in archives and narratives, and reinterprets collective experiences that have collapsed into personal ones. Through research, she builds collections of objects, images, information, narratives, and notes on why/how people tell their stories. Her practice is based on found material, and on creating materials when they cannot be found or when they do not exist.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn in [[Kuwait]] in 1974, Younis moved to [[Amman]] in 1984. She graduated as an architect from the [[University of Jordan]] in 1997.

{"title_page": "Al Guest", "text_new": "'''Al Guest''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] animation producer.\n\nHe was born in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], and started his career there when he dropped out of the [[University of Manitoba]] to pursue a career in films. A writer and fine artist, he has exhibited his paintings at many galleries in Winnipeg and [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. He is most known for his film work - especially animation - which he has written, produced, and directed in 10 studios on three continents.\n\n==Toronto==\nIn Toronto he established both an animation studio and a live action production company. In the early 1960s Guest was called on by [[Sydney Banks]], legendary Canadian broadcast and film pioneer, to help create the [[Director's Guild of Canada]] (DGC). As related by Banks, the founding President, Guest was talked into becoming its first unelected secretary and persuaded to contribute the distinctive \"director's chair\" logo still in use by the DGC.\n\nTogether with his partner, animator [[Jean Mathieson]], Guest has produced more than 4,000 television commercials, theatrical shorts, television series and sponsored films, winning more than 100 awards.\n\nAlthough known primarily for animation, they have also produced and directed live action commercials with their company in [[London, England]] as well as live action TV shows in the [[United States|U.S.]] Among their live productions produced in [[Canada]] were 130 episodes of ''[[The Bonnie Prudden Show]]'' (U.S. syndication) and 195 episodes of ''[[The Ed Allen Show]]'' (U.S. syndication).\n\nAmong their animated productions produced in Canada were: 78 episodes of ''[[The Undersea Adventures of Captain Nemo]]'', ([[CBS]]) 52 episodes of ''[[Rocket Robin Hood]]'' (CBC & international syndication), 20 episodes of ''[[The Toothbrush Family]]'' ([[CBS]]), 20 episodes of ''[[The Sunrunners]]'' ([[Ontario]] Education Channel) and 26 episodes of ''[[The Hilarious House of Frightenstein]]'' (U.S. syndication) and the [[Inuit]] special ''[[Ukaliq]]''.\n\n==Hollywood==\nSubsequently, they moved to [[Hollywood, California]] where they designed and built a complete motion-control system and produced special effects for numerous commercials and the films ''[[Alligator]]'', ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'', ''[[Body Heat]]'', and ''[[One from the Heart]]'', for which they also produced the logo animation for [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s Zoetrope Studios.\n\n==Dublin==\nOn the recommendation and financing of their New York distributor, Don Taffner, they went to [[Dublin, Ireland]] and partnered in setting up a major animation facility, Emerald City Productions, from scratch in a country that had no animation history. Providing the design and specifications for a complete reconstruction of the premises, supervising all purchasing and installation of the equipment as well as designing the furniture, they set about to recruit and train the entire staff, from animators and background artists to camera operators and editors.\n\nWhile training the staff, Al Guest and Jean Mathieson wrote, produced and directed all the studio's output including the following one-hour specials based on classic books: ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' ([[BBC]]), ''[[Ghost Stories From The Pickwick Papers]]'' (Syndication), ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' ([[HBO]]), ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'' (Syndication), ''[[Les Miserables]]'' ([[HBO]]), ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (Syndication), ''[[The Canterville Ghost]]'' (Syndication), ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' (Syndication), ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'' (with [[Global Television Network]], Canada), and ''[[Brer Rabbit Tales]]'' (Syndication).\n\n==Manila, Hong Kong & Guangzhou==\nAfter commuting from [[Los Angeles, California|L.A.]] to their [[Dublin]] studio every six weeks for four years, they sold the studio to an English company and moved to [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]]. There they were commissioned by Syd Banks, to write a live action motion picture screenplay based on the life of Emily Bront\u00eb, ''[[Emily's Story - Wuthering Heights]]'', to be produced by Denis Heroux, the producer of ''[[The Black Robe]]'' and ''[[Atlantic City]]''.\n\nTheir animation activity did not stop however,  and they wrote, directed and produced ''[[Brer Rabbit's Xmas Carol]]'', ''[[The Outrageous Adventures of Brer Rabbit]]'', and ''[[Mighty Bigfoot]]'', for which they also designed all the characters.\n\nThese productions were all made with studios in [[Manila]] and [[Guangzhou, China]], which necessitated numerous trips to the studios by Guest & Mathieson to maintain their \"hands-on\" production style. The animated commercials they produced during this period were all done in L.A. on their computers.\n\n==Los Angeles==\nIn 1998 they were appointed to the faculty of [[Mount San Antonio College]] in the new Digital Animation Production course where they taught courses in Animation Principles - Beginning and Advanced, Inbetweening, Storyboard, Layout, Animation script writing, Drawing the Figure in Motion, and CGI Environment ([[Maya (software)|Maya]]). Although certified as professors at [[Mount San Antonio College]], they left teaching after a year to produce and direct a trailer section of their script - ''[[Emily's Story - Wuthering Heights]]'', as a combination live-action & [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] production.\n\n==Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou & Suzhou==\nIn 2000, Guest & Mathieson spent 13 months directing and producing ''[[Flutemaster]]''. A ground-breaking animated series originating in California and produced in China, it was a hit running Prime Time on the Chinese network CCTV, where, as one of the most popular programs ever aired, it reached an audience of 140 million viewers during its broadcast in 2004. Guest and Mathieson designed characters, the logo, and art directed the \"look\" of the series and its promotion. They also trained Chinese concept, storyboard, and background artists in contemporary American animation style, procedures and technical standards. While in Beijing they were invited to the Beijing Broadcasting Institute where they gave an address.\n\n==Back to Hollywood==\nThey have completed a 2D series ''[[Going Buggs]]'' based on their movie ''[[Planet of the Buggs]]'', which was created and directed by their son William S. Mathieson, as well as finishing a completely CG pilot - ''[[Oh No, Domingo!]]''. \nA live action horror film they wrote - ''House of Darkness'' was produced in Montreal. \nA creative and business consultant in Videogames, Al Guest now devotes most of his time to writing Crime and Mafia novels.\n\n==External links==\n{{IMDb name|id=1375219|name=Al Guest}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*CARTOONS: ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF CINEMA ANIMATION by Giannalberto Bendazzi - Indiana University Press 1995\n*CARTOON CAPERS by Karen Mazurkewich - McArthur and Company 1999\n*COLOMBO'S CANADIAN REFERENCES by John Robert Colombo - Oxford University Press 1976\n*PRESS RELEASE - World Wide Pictures Corporation\n*THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FANTASY by John Clute and John Grant - Macmillan 1999\n*FRIGHT XMAS by Alan-Bertanellson Jones - AuthorHouse 2010\n*MORE THEATRE: M-Z by Alvin H.

The animated commercials they produced during this period were all done in L.A. on their computers.\n\n==Los Angeles==\nIn 1998 they were appointed to the faculty of [[Mount San Antonio College]] in the new Digital Animation Production course where they taught courses in Animation Principles - Beginning and Advanced, Inbetweening, Storyboard, Layout, Animation script writing, Drawing the Figure in Motion, and CGI Environment ([[Maya (software)|Maya]]). Although certified as professors at [[Mount San Antonio College]], they left teaching after a year to produce and direct a trailer section of their script - ''[[Emily's Story - Wuthering Heights]]'', as a combination live-action & [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] production.\n\n==Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou & Suzhou==\nIn 2000, Guest & Mathieson spent 13 months directing and producing ''[[Flutemaster]]''. A ground-breaking animated series originating in California and produced in China, it was a hit running Prime Time on the Chinese network CCTV, where, as one of the most popular programs ever aired, it reached an audience of 140 million viewers during its broadcast in 2004. Guest and Mathieson designed characters, the logo, and art directed the \"look\" of the series and its promotion. They also trained Chinese concept, storyboard, and background artists in contemporary American animation style, procedures and technical standards. While in Beijing they were invited to the Beijing Broadcasting Institute where they gave an address.\n\n==Back to Hollywood==\nThey have completed a 2D series ''[[Going Buggs]]'' based on their movie ''[[Planet of the Buggs]]'', which was created and directed by their son William S. Mathieson, as well as finishing a completely CG pilot - ''[[Oh No, Domingo!]]''. \nA live action horror film they wrote - ''House of Darkness'' was produced in Montreal. \nA creative and business consultant in Videogames, Al Guest now devotes most of his time to writing Crime and Mafia novels.\n\n==External links==\n{{IMDb name|id=1375219|name=Al Guest}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*CARTOONS: ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF CINEMA ANIMATION by Giannalberto Bendazzi - Indiana University Press 1995\n*CARTOON CAPERS by Karen Mazurkewich - McArthur and Company 1999\n*COLOMBO'S CANADIAN REFERENCES by John Robert Colombo - Oxford University Press 1976\n*PRESS RELEASE - World Wide Pictures Corporation\n*THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FANTASY by John Clute and John Grant - Macmillan 1999\n*FRIGHT XMAS by Alan-Bertanellson Jones - AuthorHouse 2010\n*MORE THEATRE: M-Z by Alvin H.

In this series, Tabaluga is the last of the dragons and the crown-prince of Greenland, a magical place inhabited by talking animals of many different species. Tabaluga must defend his home from two rival kingdoms on either side of Greenland; a frigid arctic tundra, ruled by the evil snowman Arktos and a searing desert, ruled by an evil sand-spirit named Humsin. It was shown on [[Seven Network]] (From 1996 till 2003) in Australia and [[ZDF]] in Germany\n\n==Plot==\nThe series focusses on Tabaluga, the last dragon living in Greenland, a land occupied by intelligent, talking animals. As a dragon he is tasked with defending Greenland against the evil snowman Arktos and the desert spirit Humsin.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Residents of Greenland===\n* Tabaluga: A small green dragon who is the main [[protagonist]] of the series. He is the prince (and later the king) of Greenland. Son of the late Tyrion. Voiced by Jamie Oxenbould. In Germany he is voiced by Bj\u00f6rn Schalla in Season 1 and Dietmar Wunder in Seasons 2 and 3.\n* Happy: A Snow hare who lives in Greenland and is one of Tabaluga's best friends. Voiced by Robyn Moore, and by Sabine Manke in German.\n* Digby: A mole from Greenland who wears glasses and one of Tabaluga's good friends. In Germany he is voiced by Edeltraud Esner in Seasons 1 and 2 and by [[Santiago Ziesmer]] in Season 3.\n* Nessaja: A giant turtle who acts as a mentor and advisor to Tabaluga. Voiced by Inken Sommer in German.\n* Buzz: A bee and one of Tabaluga's good friends.\n* Bilingua: A snake and a minor villain.

After his release, he helps advise the young dragon alongside Nessaja.\n* Tyrion: The previous ruler of Greenland and father of Tabaluga. When he died, he turned into a star, like all dragons. He occasionally appears to Tabaluga in spirit form to offer him some advice.\n* Ruby: A hummingbird and a best friend of Buzz and Digby.\n\n===Iceworld===\n* Arktos: The main [[antagonist]] and Tabaluga's arch-enemy. He is an evil snowman who aims to make Greenland a frozen wasteland. He is also the king of Iceworld. He has a hall containing animals who have been frozen by him, and is fond of ice cream. Despite his hatred for Tabaluga, he has sometimes teamed up with him when the situation called for it.

During a search for some mountain roses to complete the Greenland festival, Tabaluga rescues Leo from Arktos and takes him to join the festival. Arktos and James intensify Leo's clumsiness in order to swipe his toy to develop a new automated weapon. The damage Leo caused to a green crystal forces Tabaluga to go on an urgent quest for a new one, Leo by his side. When Tabaulga procures the new green crystal, Arktos kidnaps Leo to complete the essential part of his new weapon. Tabaluga slips into Ice Town, rescues Leo and returns in time to save the Greenland festival. Arktos launches his new automated weapon on Greenland, but Tabaluga and Leo repel it. Finally Tabaluga persuades Leo to go back to his world and join his new foster parents.\n\n== Broadcast History ==\nThe cartoon series of Tabaluga originally shown on [[ZDF]] in Germany is presently being shown in the UK on the following channels:\n \n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Country !!

Films Studio\" and \"Yoram Gross-EM.TV\"), based on the [[Tabaluga|character of the same name]] created by [[Peter Maffay]]. In this series, Tabaluga is the last of the dragons and the crown-prince of Greenland, a magical place inhabited by talking animals of many different species. Tabaluga must defend his home from two rival kingdoms on either side of Greenland; a frigid arctic tundra, ruled by the evil snowman Arktos and a searing desert, ruled by an evil sand-spirit named Humsin. It was shown on [[Seven Network]] (From 1996 till 2003) in Australia and [[ZDF]] in Germany\n\n==Plot==\nThe series focusses on Tabaluga, the last dragon living in Greenland, a land occupied by intelligent, talking animals. As a dragon he is tasked with defending Greenland against the evil snowman Arktos and the desert spirit Humsin.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Residents of Greenland===\n* Tabaluga: A small green dragon who is the main [[protagonist]] of the series. He is the prince (and later the king) of Greenland. Son of the late Tyrion. Voiced by Jamie Oxenbould. In Germany he is voiced by Bj\u00f6rn Schalla in Season 1 and Dietmar Wunder in Seasons 2 and 3.\n* Happy: A Snow hare who lives in Greenland and is one of Tabaluga's best friends. Voiced by Robyn Moore, and by Sabine Manke in German.\n* Digby: A mole from Greenland who wears glasses and one of Tabaluga's good friends. In Germany he is voiced by Edeltraud Esner in Seasons 1 and 2 and by [[Santiago Ziesmer]] in Season 3.\n* Nessaja: A giant turtle who acts as a mentor and advisor to Tabaluga. Voiced by Inken Sommer in German.\n* Buzz: A bee and one of Tabaluga's good friends.\n* Bilingua: A snake and a minor villain. She had shown in at least one episode (Queen for One Day) that she had the power of hypnosis.\n* Shouhu: An owl, who has a magic crystal ball. He is a prisoner to Arktos for his foresight. After his release, he helps advise the young dragon alongside Nessaja.\n* Tyrion: The previous ruler of Greenland and father of Tabaluga. When he died, he turned into a star, like all dragons. He occasionally appears to Tabaluga in spirit form to offer him some advice.\n* Ruby: A hummingbird and a best friend of Buzz and Digby.\n\n===Iceworld===\n* Arktos: The main [[antagonist]] and Tabaluga's arch-enemy. He is an evil snowman who aims to make Greenland a frozen wasteland. He is also the king of Iceworld. He has a hall containing animals who have been frozen by him, and is fond of ice cream. Despite his hatred for Tabaluga, he has sometimes teamed up with him when the situation called for it. Voiced by [[Keith Scott (voice actor)|Keith Scott]] in English and Frank Ciazynski in German.\n* James: The polite and gentle penguin who serves Arktos and pilots his master's transport, The Arktoplane.

In Germany he is voiced by Eberhard Pr\u00fcter.\n* Attila the Walrus: Arktos' cook.\n* Vultur: A reconnaissance spy and messenger for Arktos, but then changed allegiance to Humsin. Afterwards he turns back to Arktos.\n* Fritz: Arktos' pet shark, who often tries to eat his carrot nose.\n* Lilly (or Lilli): A sculpture created by Arktos.

An orphaned boy named Leo who is having no luck getting a foster family decides to run away and enters a portal into Iceworld. During a search for some mountain roses to complete the Greenland festival, Tabaluga rescues Leo from Arktos and takes him to join the festival. Arktos and James intensify Leo's clumsiness in order to swipe his toy to develop a new automated weapon. The damage Leo caused to a green crystal forces Tabaluga to go on an urgent quest for a new one, Leo by his side. When Tabaulga procures the new green crystal, Arktos kidnaps Leo to complete the essential part of his new weapon. Tabaluga slips into Ice Town, rescues Leo and returns in time to save the Greenland festival. Arktos launches his new automated weapon on Greenland, but Tabaluga and Leo repel it. Finally Tabaluga persuades Leo to go back to his world and join his new foster parents.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|193549|title=Tabaluga}}\n*{{bcdb title|75628|title=Tabaluga}}\n*{{tv.com show|tabaluga|Tabaluga}}\n\n[[Category:1990s Australian animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s Australian animated television series]]\n[[Category:1990s German television series]]\n[[Category:2000s German television series]]\n[[Category:1994 German television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2004 German television series endings]]\n[[Category:Australian children's animated fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:Television series set in fictional locations]]\n[[Category:Fox Family Channel original programming]]\n[[Category:Fox Kids original programming]]\n[[Category:German animated television series]]\n[[Category:German children's television series]]\n[[Category:Seven Network shows]]\n[[Category:Australian animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:TG4 television programmes]]\n[[Category:ZDF television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:German-language television programs]]\n[[Category:German fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about dragons]]\n", "name_user": "86.154.51.111", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eEpisodes)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabaluga_(TV_series)"}

[[Fiddler crabs]] are called \"semi-terrestrial\" since they make burrows in the muddy substrate, to which they retreat during high tides. When the tide is out, fiddler crabs search the beach for food. The same is true in the [[mollusca]].

Goofy is a tall, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog who typically wears a [[turtle neck]] and [[vest]], with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled [[fedora]]. Goofy is a close friend of [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]]. He is normally characterized as extremely [[Accident-proneness|clumsy]] and somewhat [[Stupidity|dimwitted]], yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally Goofy is shown as [[intuitive]], and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way.\n\nGoofy debuted in [[animated cartoon]]s, starting in 1932 with ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'' as '''Dippy Dawg''', who is older than Goofy would come to be. Later the same year, he was re-imagined as a younger character, now called Goofy, in the short ''[[The Whoopee Party]]''. During the 1930s, he was used extensively as part of a comedy trio with [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and Donald. Starting in 1939, Goofy was given his own series of shorts that were popular in the 1940s and early 1950s. Two ''Goofy'' shorts were nominated for an Oscar: ''[[How to Play Football]]'' (1944) and ''[[Aquamania]]'' (1961). He also co-starred in a short series with Donald, including ''[[Polar Trappers]]'' (1938), where they first appeared without [[Mickey Mouse]]. Three more ''Goofy'' shorts were produced in the 1960s after which Goofy was only seen in television and [[Disney comics]]. He returned to theatrical animation in 1983 with ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''. His last theatrical appearance was ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]]'' in 2007. Goofy has also been featured in television, most extensively in ''[[Goof Troop]]'' (1992), ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'' (2001\u20132003), ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' (2006\u20132016), ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' (2013\u2013present), and ''[[Mickey Mouse: Mixed-Up Adventures|Mickey and the Roadster Racers]]'' (2017\u2013present).\n\nOriginally known as Dippy Dawg, the character is more commonly known simply as \"Goofy\", a name used in his short film series. In his 1950s cartoons, he usually played a character called '''George G. Geef'''. Sources from the ''Goof Troop'' continuity give the character's full name as '''G. G. \"Goofy\" Goof''',<ref>{{cite episode|title=Everything's Coming Up Goofy|series=Goof Troop|airdate=September 5, 1992|season=1 (Disney Afternoon)|number=1}}: Goofy's diploma, as read aloud by the How-to Narrator, refers to him by the formal name of \"Mr. G.

In many other sources, both animated and comics, the surname Goof continues to be used. In other 2000s-era comics, the character's full name has occasionally been given as '''Goofus D. Dawg'''.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to [[Pinto Colvig]], the original voice artist for the character, Goofy was inspired by a \"grinny, half-baked village nitwit\" from his hometown of [[Jacksonville, Oregon]], and he had previously used his mannerisms for a stage character he created named \"The Oregon Appleknocker\". After a discussion with [[Walt Disney]] and director [[Wilfred Jackson]], it was decided that this would be the basis for a new member of the expanding Mickey Mouse cast. Colvig would spend the next day in the recording studio acting out the new cartoon character in front of animator [[Tom Palmer (animator)|Tom Palmer]]. Based on Colvig's \"grotesque poses and expressions\", Palmer would sketch out what would become Goofy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Colvig, Pinto|year=2015|title=It's A Crazy Business: The Goofy Life of a Disney Legend|page=99|editors=Pierce, Todd James; Mclain, Bob|isbn=978-1-941500-49-1}}</ref> Animator [[Art Babbit]] is credited for developing his character. In a 1930s lecture, Babbitt described the character as: \"Think of the Goof as a composite of an everlasting optimist, a gullible [[Good Samaritan]], a half-wit, a shiftless, good-natured colored boy and a hick\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Walt Disney's Goofy: The Good Sport |last=O'Brien |first=Flora |authorlink= |year=1986 |publisher=HPBooks |location=Tucson |isbn=978-0-89586-414-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/waltdisneysgoofy0000unse_x4g6/page/18 18] |url=https://archive.org/details/waltdisneysgoofy0000unse_x4g6/page/18 }}</ref>\n\nIn the comics and his pre-1992 animated appearances, Goofy was usually single and childless.  Unlike Mickey and Donald, he didn't have a steady girlfriend.  The exception was the 1950s cartoons, in which Goofy played a character called George Geef who was married and at one point became the father of a kid named George Junior. In the ''[[Goof Troop]]'' series (1992\u20131993), however, Goofy was portrayed as a single father with a son named [[Max Goof|Max]], and the character of Max made further animated appearances until 2004. This marked a division between animation and comics, as the latter kept showing Goofy as a single childless character, excluding comics taking place in the ''Goof Troop'' continuity. After 2004, Max disappeared from animation, thus removing the division between the two media. Goofy's wife was never shown, while George Geef's wife appeared\u2014[[Unseen character|but always with her face unseen]]\u2014in 1950s-produced cartoon shorts depicting the character as a \"family man\".<ref>Officially, Disney's Guest Services once declared there to be \"no definitive answer\" as to \"who Max's mother is and where \"Mrs. Goofy\" went\", leaving her fate up to unofficial speculation and presumption. {{cite web|url=http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 |title=Disney FAQ: Who was the mother of Goofy's son Max? |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]] |accessdate=2014-07-31 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810155058/http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Disneyland IMG 3970.jpg|thumb|right|Goofy's house at [[Disneyland]].]]\n\nIn the comics, Goofy usually appears as Mickey's sidekick, though he also is occasionally shown as a protagonist.<ref>[https://inducks.org/comp2.php?code=&keyw=&keywt=i&exactpg=&pg1=&pg2=&bro2=&bro3=&exactparts=&parts1=&parts2=&kind=nk&rowsperpage=0&columnsperpage=0&hero=&xapp=Goofy&univ=&xa2=&creat=&creat2=&plot=&plot2=&writ=&writ2=&art=&art2=&ink=&ink2=&excludeCZ=on&pub1=1900&pub2=&ser=&xref=&mref=&xrefd=&repabb=&repabbc=al&imgmode=0&vdesc2=on&vdesc=en&vus=on&sort1=s.firstpublicationdate Chronological list of Goofy's appearances in comics] according to the [[INDUCKS]] database.

As such, he threatened constantly to terminate the series, but only continued it to provide [[make-work]] for his animators.<ref name=\"micechat\">{{cite web |url=http://micechat.com/forums/news/42925-disneytim-talks-walt-disney-historian-neal-gabler-micechat-news-team-10-29-06-a.html |title=Disneytim Talks with Walt Disney Historian Neal Gabler \u2013 MiceChat News Team, 10/29/06 |publisher=micechat.com |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}</ref> Animation historian [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] is skeptical of Gabler's claim, saying that his source did not correspond with what was written.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Commentary/Gabler/GablerErrata.htm |author= Barrier, Michael |date= December 2006 |title= 'Walt Disney's Errors and Ambiguities' |publisher= MichaelBarrier.com |accessdate= May 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Goofy Debut.PNG|left|thumb|250px|Goofy, anonymous in his debut cartoon, ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'' (1932).]]\n\nGoofy first appeared in ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'', first released on May 25, 1932. Directed by [[Wilfred Jackson]] this short movie features [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Horace Horsecollar]] and [[Clarabelle Cow]] performing another song and dance show. Mickey and his gang's animated shorts by this point routinely featured song and dance numbers. It begins as a typical Mickey cartoon of the time, but what would set this short apart from all that had come before was the appearance of a new character, whose behavior served as a running gag. Dippy Dawg, as he was named by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] artists (Frank Webb), was a member of the audience. He constantly irritated his fellow spectators by noisily crunching peanuts and laughing loudly, until two of those fellow spectators knocked him out with their mallets (and then did the same exact laugh as he did). This early version of Goofy had other differences with the later and more developed ones besides the name. He was an old man with a white beard, a puffy tail, and no trousers, shorts, or undergarments. But the short introduced Goofy's distinct laughter. This laughter was provided by [[Pinto Colvig]]. A considerably younger Dippy Dawg then appeared in ''[[The Whoopee Party]]'', first released on September 17, 1932, as a party guest and a friend of Mickey and his gang. Dippy Dawg made a total of four appearances in 1932 and two more in 1933, but most of them were mere [[Cameo appearance|cameos]].\n\nIn the Silly Symphonies cartoon ''[[The Grasshopper and the Ants (film)|The Grasshopper and the Ants]],'' the Grasshopper had an aloof character similar to Goofy and shared the same voice (Pinto Colvig) as the Goofy character.\n\nBy his seventh appearance, in ''[[Orphan's Benefit]]'' first released on August 11, 1934, he gained the new name \"Goofy\" and became a regular member of the gang along with two other new characters: [[Donald Duck]] and [[Clara Cluck]].\n\n===Trio years with Mickey and Donald===\n''[[Mickey's Service Station]]'' directed by [[Ben Sharpsteen]], first released on March 16, 1935, was the first of the classic \"Mickey, Donald, and Goofy\" comedy shorts. Those films had the trio trying to cooperate in performing a certain assignment given to them. Early on they became separated from each other. Then the short's focus started alternating between each of them facing the problems at hand, each in their own way and distinct style of comedy. The end of the short would reunite the three to share the fruits of their efforts, failure more often than success. ''[[Clock Cleaners]]'', first released on October 15, 1937, and ''[[Lonesome Ghosts]]'', first released on December 24, 1937, are usually considered the highlights of this series and animated classics.\n\nProgressively during the series, Mickey's part diminished in favor of Donald, Goofy, and Pluto. The reason for this was simple: Between the easily frustrated Donald and Pluto and the always-living-in-a-world-of-his-own Goofy, Mickey\u2014who became progressively gentler and more laid-back\u2014seemed to act as the [[double act|straight man]] of the trio. The studio's artists found that it had become easier coming up with new gags for Goofy or Donald than Mickey, to a point that Mickey's role had become unnecessary. ''[[Polar Trappers]]'', first released on June 17, 1938, was the first film to feature Goofy and Donald as a duo. The short features the duo as partners and owners of \"Donald and Goofy Trapping Co.\" They have settled in the [[Arctic]] for an unspecified period of time, to capture live [[walrus]]es to bring back to civilization. Their food supplies consist of [[canning|canned]] [[bean]]s. The focus shifts between Goofy trying to set traps for walruses and Donald trying to catch [[penguin]]s to use as food&nbsp;\u2014 both with the same lack of success. Mickey would return in ''[[The Whalers]]'', first released on August 19, 1938, but this and also ''Tugboat Mickey'', released on April 26, 1940, would be the last two shorts to feature all three characters as a team.\n\n===Break off into solo series===\nGoofy next starred at his first solo cartoon ''[[Goofy and Wilbur]]'' directed by [[Dick Huemer]], first released on March 17, 1939. The short featured Goofy fishing with the help of Wilbur, his pet [[grasshopper]].\n\n===The ''How to...'' series===\n[[File:Disney drawing goofy.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Walt Disney|Disney]] drawing Goofy for a group of girls in Argentina, 1941.]]\nIn 1938, one year after his last session as the character, Colvig had a falling out with Disney and left the studio, leaving Goofy without a voice.<ref name=\"Hischak\"/> According to [[Leonard Maltin]], this is what caused the ''How to...'' cartoons of the 1940s in which Goofy had little dialogue, and a narrator (often John McLeish) was used (they would also reuse Colvig's voice in recording or hire a man named Danny Webb to imitate it). In the cartoons, Goofy would demonstrate clumsily but always determined and never frustrated, how to do everything from snow ski to sleeping, to football, to riding a horse. The Goofy ''How to...'' cartoons worked so well that they became a staple format, and are still used in current Goofy shorts, the most recent being the ''How to Hook Up Your Home Theater'', released theatrically in 2007.\n\nLater, starting with ''[[How to Play Baseball]]'' (1942), Goofy starred in a series of cartoons where ''every'' single character in the cartoon was a different version of Goofy. This took Goofy out of the role of just being a clumsy cartoon character and into an Everyman figure. Colvig returned to Disney in 1940 and resumed the voice of Goofy three years later.<ref name=\"Hischak\"/> Many of the Goofy cartoons were directed by [[Jack Kinney]].\n\n===[[World War II]]===\n{{expand section|date=November 2015|more information about Goofy during World War II}}\nDuring World War II Goofy was drafted and became the mascot emblem of the [[602nd Bombardment Squadron]] and the [[756th Air Refueling Squadron|756 Bombardment Squadron]] U.S. Air Corps.\n<gallery>\nFile:602d Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png|<center>[[602nd Bombardment Squadron]] emblem (approved 6 March 1944)<ref name=Maurer602BS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons '', pp. 680-681</ref></center>\nFile:756th Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png|<center>[[756th Bombardment Squadron]] emblem</center>\n</gallery>\n\n===The ''Everyman'' years===\n[[File:Geefgoof.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Goofy in his \"George Geef\" persona in {{nowrap|''Cold War''}} (1951).]]\n\nThe 1950s saw Goofy transformed into a family man going through the trials of everyday life, such as dieting, giving up smoking, and the problems of raising children. Walt Disney himself came up with this idea,<ref>Harry Tytle ''One Of \"Walt's Boys,\"'' (Mission Viejo, 1997) pg 86</ref> hoping it would put personality back into the character that he felt was lost when Goofy was merely a crowd of extras. Goofy is never called \"Goofy\" during this period. While every cartoon continued with the opening, \"''Walt Disney presents Goofy''\" before each cartoon's title, he was usually called \"George Geef\" in the cartoons' dialogue. When the stories featured Goofy as multiple characters, then he had numerous other names as well. In addition, the 1950s Goofy shorts gave Goofy a makeover. He was more intelligent, had smaller eyes with eyebrows, often his whole body was pale instead of just his face (while the rest was black), and sometimes had a normal voice. He even lacked his droopy ears, the external pair of teeth and white gloves in some shorts.\n\nAccording to animation historian Christopher P. Lehman, Disney had started casting Goofy as a [[suburb]]an [[everyman]] in the late 1940s. And with this role came changes in depiction. Goofy's facial stubble and his protruding teeth were removed to give him a more refined look.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 27-28</ref> His clothing changed from a [[casual attire|casual style]] to wearing [[business suits]]. He began to look more human and less dog-like, with his ears hidden in his hat.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> By 1951, Goofy was portrayed as being married and having a son of his own. Neither the wife nor the son was portrayed as dog-like. The wife's face was never seen, but her form was human. The son lacked Goofy's dog-like ears.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/>\n\nLehman connects this depiction of the character to Disney's use of humor and animal characters to reinforce social [[conformity]]. He cites as an example ''[[Aquamania]]'' (1961), where everyman Goofy drives to the lake for a boat ride. During a scene depicting a [[Multiple-vehicle collision|pile-up accident]], every car involved has a boat hitched to its rear bumper. Goofy is portrayed as one of the numerous people who had the same idea about how to spend their day. Every contestant in the boat race also looks like Goofy.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> Lehman does not think that Disney used these aspects of the film to poke fun at conformity. Instead, the studio apparently accepted conformity as a fundamental aspect of the [[society of the United States]].<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> ''Aquamania'' was released in the 1960s, but largely maintained and prolonged the [[status quo]] of the 1950s. The decade had changed but the Disney studio followed the same story formulas for theatrical animated shorts it had followed in the previous decade. And Lehman points that Disney received [[Normative social influence|social approval]] for it. ''Aquamania'' itself received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]].<ref name=\"Lehman\"/>\n\n===Later appearances===\nAfter the 1965 educational film ''Goofy's Freeway Troubles'', Goofy was mostly retired except for cameos, because of the fading popularity, and the death of the voice actor [[Pinto Colvig]]. Goofy had an act in the 1969 tour show, [[Disney on Parade]] with costar [[Herbie|Herbie the Love Bug]]. He only makes a brief appearance in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Amblin Entertainment|Amblin]]'s Academy Award-winning hit ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', in which the titular [[Roger Rabbit]] says of Goofy: \"Nobody takes a whollup like Goofy! What timing! What finesse! What a genius!\". However, he made a comeback in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' as the ghost of Jacob Marley. After that, he appeared in ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' which was originally intended to be released theatrically in 1984 but was aired as a 1987 TV special instead. His popularity then rose again. With Colvig dead, Goofy was then voiced with different voice actors until [[Bill Farmer]] became the official voice.\n\n[[File:Goofymoviemain.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Goofy (right) with his son [[Max Goof|Max]] (left) in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995)]] \nIn the 1990s, Goofy got his own TV series called ''[[Goof Troop]]''. In the show, Goofy lives with his son [[Max Goof|Max]] and his cat Waffles, and they live next door to [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] and his family. ''Goof Troop'' eventually led to Goofy and Max starring in their own movies: ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (in 1995) and ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' (in 2000); as well as starring in their own segments of ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (in 1999) and ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (in 2004). While Goofy is clearly depicted as a single custodial parent in all of these appearances, by the end of ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' he begins a romance with the character Sylvia Marpole, Max being grown and in college by this point.\n\nIn one episode of ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'', Goofy has an off-screen cameo whose distinctive laugh is \"stolen\" by a disgruntled toon. In another episode, both he and Pete cameo as actors who film cartoons at Wackytoon Studios. And in a third episode, Goofy cameos as part of a group of civilians held hostage in a bank robbery.\n\nGoofy returned to his traditional personality in ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and appeared as a head waiter in ''[[House of Mouse]]'' (2001 to 2004). Goofy's son [[Max Goof|Max]] also appeared in ''House of Mouse'' as the nightclub's valet, so that Goofy juggled not only his conventional antics but also the father-role displayed in ''Goof Troop'' and its aforementioned related media. In both ''Mickey Mouse Works'' and ''House of Mouse'', Goofy also seemed to have a crush on [[Clarabelle Cow]], as he asks her on a date in the ''House of Mouse'' episode \"Super Goof\" and is stalked by the bovine in the [[Mickey Mouse Works]] cartoon \"How To Be a Spy\". Though Clarabelle was noted as [[Horace Horsecollar]]'s fianc\u00e9 in early decades, comics from the 1960s and 1970s and more recent cartoons like the aforementioned ''House of Mouse'' and ''Mickey Mouse Works'', as well as ''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]'', imply some mutual affections between Goofy and Clarabelle; perhaps as an attempt for Disney to give Goofy a more mainstream girlfriend to match his two male co-stars.\n\nOn [[Disney's Toontown Online]], an interactive website for kids, Goofy previously ran his own neighborhood called Goofy Speedway until the close of Toontown. Goofy Speedway was a place where you could race cars and enter the Grand Prix, too. Tickets were exclusively spent on everything there, instead of the usual jellybean currency. The Grand Prix only came on \"Grand Prix Monday\" and \"Silly Saturday\". Goofy's Gag Shop was also found in almost every part of Toontown' except Cog HQs, Goofy Speedway, or Chip & Dale's Acorn Acres. At Goofy's Gag Shop, Toons could buy gags.\n\nGoofy also appears in the [[children's television series]], ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', with his trademark attire and personality.

In the early years, the other members of Mickey Mouse's gang considered him a meddler and a pest but eventually warmed up to him.\n\nThe [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip]] drawn by [[Floyd Gottfredson]] was generally based on what was going on in the Mickey Mouse shorts at the time, but when Donald Duck's popularity led to Donald Duck gaining [[Donald Duck (comic strip)|his own newspaper strip]], Disney decided that he was no longer allowed to appear in Gottfredson's strips. Accordingly, Goofy remained alone as Mickey's sidekick, replacing [[Horace Horsecollar]] as Mickey's fellow adventurer and companion. Similarly in comics, the Mickey Mouse world with Goofy as Mickey's sidekick was usually very separate from the Donald Duck world and crossovers were rare.\nGoofy also has a characteristic habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth, a trademark that was introduced by [[Paul Murry]].\n\nA character called \"Glory-Bee\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/glorybee.html |title=Glory-Bee |publisher=Users.cwnet.com |accessdate=2014-08-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313131713/http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/glorybee.html |archivedate=2015-03-13 }}</ref> was Goofy's girlfriend for some years.\n\nIn 1990, when Disney was publishing [[Disney Comics (publishing)|their own comics]], Goofy starred in ''[[Goofy Adventures]]'', that featured him starring in various parodies. Unfortunately, perhaps because of poor sales, ''Goofy Adventures'' was the first of the company's titles to be canceled by the Disney Comics Implosion, ending at its 17th issue.\n\n===Super Goof===\n{{Infobox comics character<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image         =\n| caption       =\n| character_name = Super Goof\n| real_name     = Goofy\n| publisher     = [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Co.]] (licenser)<br />[[Western Publishing]] (licensee)\n| debut='''First version''': \"The Phantom Blot meets Super Goof\" (''Walt Disney's The Phantom Blot'' #2, Feb. 1965)<br />'''Second version''': \"All's Well that Ends Awful\" (''[[Donald Duck (American comic book)|Donald Duck]]'' #102, July 1965)<br />'''Third and definitive version''': \"The Thief of Zanzipar\" (''Walt Disney Super Goof'' #1, Oct. 1965)\n| creators      = Del Connell (script, first two versions)<br />[[Bob Ogle]] (script, third and definitive version)<br />[[Paul Murry]] (art, all three versions)\n| alliances     = Super Gilbert\n| previous_alliances =\n| aliases      =\n| powers       = Can fly, has x-ray vision, invulnerability, super strength, super speed, superbreath, and other powers\n}}\n\n'''Super Goof''' is Goofy's [[superhero]] alter ego who gets his powers by eating super [[goobers]] (peanuts).

In the Disney Channel ''[[Mickey Mouse (2013 TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' TV series, Goofy dresses as Super Goof for the half-hour Halloween special.\n\n==In video games==\n\n===''Kingdom Hearts'' series===\n[[File:Goofyll8.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goofy, as he appears in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series. His attire was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]].]]\n\nGoofy is the captain of the royal guard at Disney Castle in the [[Kingdom Hearts|''Kingdom Hearts'' video game series]]. Averse to using actual weapons, Goofy fights with a shield. Following a letter left by the missing king Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Donald, the court magician, meet [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] and embark on a quest with him to find the King and Sora's missing friends. In the game series, Goofy still suffers from being the butt of comic relief, but also is the constant voice of optimism and, surprisingly, selectively perceptive, often noticing things others miss and keeping his cool when Sora and Donald lose it. Goofy's loyalty was also tested when Riku wielded the Keyblade thus, following the king's orders, he followed Riku instead. As Riku was about to attack Sora, Goofy used his shield to protect Sora; thus disobeying the king. When Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter the realm known as Timeless River, Goofy states that the world looks familiar; a reference to his cartoons done in the early to mid-1930s. At many times in the'' Kingdom Hearts'' series, Goofy is shown to still be his clumsy self, however, in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', he is very keen to details and has very accurate assumptions of certain things. For example, he was the first to figure out why [[Organization XIII]] was after the [[Beast (Disney character)|Beast]], and he was the first to see through [[Mulan (Disney character)|Fa Mulan]]'s disguise and discovery that Mulan was actually a woman dressed as a male soldier. There were even several instances where Goofy seemed to have more common sense than Sora and Donald, even saying they should \"look before we leap\" when Sora and Donald saw [[Mushu]]'s shadow resembling a dragon, that Sora had mistaken for a Heartless.\n\nGoofy reappears in the prequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'', in a relatively minor role, having accompanied Mickey (along with Donald) to Yen Sid's tower to watch Mickey's Mark of Mastery Exam. Upon realizing that Mickey has been abducted and taken to the Keyblade Graveyard by Master Xehanort in an attempt to lure Ventus out, Goofy and Donald prepare to venture out to rescue Mickey, but as they will obviously be no match for Master Xehanort, Ventus goes alone. Donald and Goofy later care for their King as he recuperates from his injuries.\n\n===In other video games===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}{{Update section|date=March 2020}}\n\n*Goofy was the star of an early platformer, ''Matterhorn Screamer'' for the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]].\n\n* Goofy appears as the owner (or perhaps simply the cashier) of the \"Junk\" store in ''[[Donald Duck's Playground]]'', developed and published in the 1980s by Sierra On-Line for the Commodore 64, IBM PC, Apple II, Amiga, and Atari ST.\n\n* Goofy also starred in [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] action game ''[[Goof Troop (video game)|Goof Troop]]'' alongside his son [[Max Goof|Max]] and in ''[[Goofy's Hysterical History Tour]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]] where he's ahead janitor and he must recover the missing pieces of some museum exhibits.\n\n* Goofy appears briefly in ''[[Quackshot]]'', a Genesis game that starred Donald Duck. Goofy is located within the ancient ruins in Mexico and gives Donald the red plunger (an upgrade to Donald's plunger gun allows the climbing of walls) and a strange note that solves a puzzle in Egypt later in the game.\n\n* He also was in the [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] game ''[[Disney's Party]]'' as one of the playable characters.\n\n* Two games for kids were released: ''[[Goofy's Fun House]]'' for the [[PlayStation]] and ''Goofy's Railway Express'' for the [[Commodore 64]].\n\n* He also appears 2001 in ''[[Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding]]'' for [[Personal computer|PC]].\n\n* Goofy is a playable character in ''[[Disney TH!NK Fast]]''.\n\n* Concept art for Goofy was made for his appearance in the 2009 & 2010 [[Wii]] game, ''[[Epic Mickey]]''. He appears as one of the \"buddies\" that the Mad Doctor creates for [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] to replicate the facade of Mickey Mouse's success. A variation of him seems to appear as a minor shopkeeper named Tiki Sam.\n\n* Goofy briefly appears in ''[[Disney's Magical Quest]]'' for Super NES, released in 1992.\n\n* As noted above, Goofy appears in Disney's online game ''[[Toontown Online]]''.\n\n* Goofy was also a playable character in ''[[Disney Golf]]'' for the PS2.\n\n* Goofy is one the eight playable racers in the [[GBA]] game ''Disney Kart: Circuit Tour''.\n\n==Voice actors==\n[[Pinto Colvig]] voiced Goofy for most of his classic appearances from 1932 (''[[Mickey's Revue]]'') to 1938 (''[[The Whalers]]'') when he had a fallout with Disney and left the company to work on other projects. He was later replaced by Danny Webb from 1939 to 1941.<ref name=Canemaker/> However, Colvig returned to Disney and resumed the role in 1944 (''How to Be a Sailor'') until shortly before his death in 1967. One of his last known performances as the character was for the [[Telephone Pavilion (Expo 67)|Telephone Pavilion]] at [[Expo 67]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5484336/the_akron_beacon_journal/|title=The Akron Beacon Journal, October 21, 1967|newspaper=The Akron Beacon Journal}}</ref> Many cartoons feature Goofy silent or have recycled dialogue from earlier shorts or have various different-sounding Goofys instead of the original. Colvig also gave Goofy a normal voice for four George Geef. [[Stuart Buchanan]] voiced Goofy in ''[[The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air]]''. Bob Jackman took Colvig's place when he left the Disney Studios for unknown reasons and voiced Goofy in 1951 for a brief time.

Aside from those occasions, [[Bill Farmer]] has been voicing Goofy since 1987. While Pope was the sole voice credit for Goofy in ''Roger Rabbit'', Farmer actually provided some of Goofy's lines in the movie as well.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhpr84WzJLg 2011 Disneyana Fan Club Convention Highlight: Voice Panel]</ref> Farmer closely imitated Colvig for projects like ''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1990 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]'' but began putting his own spin on the character in 1992's ''[[Goof Troop]]''. Farmer also inherited Colvig's other characters, like [[Pluto (Disney character)|Pluto]], [[Sleepy (character)|Sleepy]], and [[Practical Pig]].\n\n==Relatives==\n\n===Max Goof===\n{{Main|Max Goof}}\n\nMax Goof is Goofy's teenage son. He first appeared in the 1992 television series ''[[Goof Troop]]'' and stars in both the spin-off film ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995) and its [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' (2000). He also features in the direct-to-video ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (1999), its sequel ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (2004), and the 2001 TV series ''[[House of Mouse]]''. Max is a [[playable character]] on the [[Super NES]] video game ''[[Goof Troop]]'' (1993), the [[PlayStation 2]] video game ''Disney Golf'' (2002), and the [[Personal computer|PC]] video game ''[[Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding]]'' (2001).\n\nMax is one of the few Disney characters aside from his best friend [[Pete Junior|P.J.]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], child or otherwise, who has actually aged in subsequent appearances. He was depicted as an eleven-year-old middle school student in ''[[Goof Troop]]'', then a high school student in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', and then a high school graduate teenager starting college in ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''. In ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'', he is still a teenager but old enough to be employed as a [[valet parking|parking valet]].\n\n==Goofy holler==\nThe Goofy holler is a [[stock sound effect]] that is used frequently in [[Walt Disney]] cartoons and films. It is the cry Goofy makes when falling or being launched into the air, that can be transcribed as \"Yaaaaaaa-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooey!\" The holler was originally recorded by [[yodeling|yodeller]] [[Hannes Schroll|Hann\u00e8s Schroll]] for the 1941 short ''[[The Art of Skiing]]''.

Goofy is a tall, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog who typically wears a [[turtle neck]] and [[vest]], with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled [[fedora]]. Goofy is a close friend of [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]]. He is normally characterized as extremely [[Accident-proneness|clumsy]] and somewhat [[Stupidity|dimwitted]], yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally Goofy is shown as [[intuitive]], and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way.\n\nGoofy debuted in [[animated cartoon]]s, starting in 1932 with ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'' as '''Dippy Dawg''', who is older than Goofy would come to be. Later the same year, he was re-imagined as a younger character, now called Goofy, in the short ''[[The Whoopee Party]]''. During the 1930s, he was used extensively as part of a comedy trio with [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and Donald. Starting in 1939, Goofy was given his own series of shorts that were popular in the 1940s and early 1950s. Two ''Goofy'' shorts were nominated for an Oscar: ''[[How to Play Football]]'' (1944) and ''[[Aquamania]]'' (1961). He also co-starred in a short series with Donald, including ''[[Polar Trappers]]'' (1938), where they first appeared without [[Mickey Mouse]]. Three more ''Goofy'' shorts were produced in the 1960s after which Goofy was only seen in television and [[Disney comics]]. He returned to theatrical animation in 1983 with ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''. His last theatrical appearance was ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]]'' in 2007. Goofy has also been featured in television, most extensively in ''[[Goof Troop]]'' (1992), ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'' (2001\u20132003), ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' (2006\u20132016), ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' (2013\u2013present), and ''[[Mickey Mouse: Mixed-Up Adventures|Mickey and the Roadster Racers]]'' (2017\u2013present).\n\nOriginally known as Dippy Dawg, the character is more commonly known simply as \"Goofy\", a name used in his short film series. In his 1950s cartoons, he usually played a character called '''George G. Geef'''. Sources from the ''Goof Troop'' continuity give the character's full name as '''G. G. \"Goofy\" Goof''',<ref>{{cite episode|title=Everything's Coming Up Goofy|series=Goof Troop|airdate=September 5, 1992|season=1 (Disney Afternoon)|number=1}}: Goofy's diploma, as read aloud by the How-to Narrator, refers to him by the formal name of \"Mr. G.

In many other sources, both animated and comics, the surname Goof continues to be used. In other 2000s-era comics, the character's full name has occasionally been given as '''Goofus D. Dawg'''.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to [[Pinto Colvig]], the original voice artist for the character, Goofy was inspired by a \"grinny, half-baked village nitwit\" from his hometown of [[Jacksonville, Oregon]], and he had previously used his mannerisms for a stage character he created named \"The Oregon Appleknocker\". After a discussion with [[Walt Disney]] and director [[Wilfred Jackson]], it was decided that this would be the basis for a new member of the expanding Mickey Mouse cast. Colvig would spend the next day in the recording studio acting out the new cartoon character in front of animator [[Tom Palmer (animator)|Tom Palmer]]. Based on Colvig's \"grotesque poses and expressions\", Palmer would sketch out what would become Goofy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Colvig, Pinto|year=2015|title=It's A Crazy Business: The Goofy Life of a Disney Legend|page=99|editors=Pierce, Todd James; Mclain, Bob|isbn=978-1-941500-49-1}}</ref> Animator [[Art Babbit]] is credited for developing his character. In a 1930s lecture, Babbitt described the character as: \"Think of the Goof as a composite of an everlasting optimist, a gullible [[Good Samaritan]], a half-wit, a shiftless, good-natured colored boy and a hick\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Walt Disney's Goofy: The Good Sport |last=O'Brien |first=Flora |authorlink= |year=1986 |publisher=HPBooks |location=Tucson |isbn=978-0-89586-414-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/waltdisneysgoofy0000unse_x4g6/page/18 18] |url=https://archive.org/details/waltdisneysgoofy0000unse_x4g6/page/18 }}</ref>\n\nIn the comics and his pre-1992 animated appearances, Goofy was usually single and childless.  Unlike Mickey and Donald, he didn't have a steady girlfriend.  The exception was the 1950s cartoons, in which Goofy played a character called George Geef who was married and at one point became the father of a kid named George Junior. In the ''[[Goof Troop]]'' series (1992\u20131993), however, Goofy was portrayed as a single father with a son named [[Max Goof|Max]], and the character of Max made further animated appearances until 2004. This marked a division between animation and comics, as the latter kept showing Goofy as a single childless character, excluding comics taking place in the ''Goof Troop'' continuity. After 2004, Max disappeared from animation, thus removing the division between the two media. Goofy's wife was never shown, while George Geef's wife appeared\u2014[[Unseen character|but always with her face unseen]]\u2014in 1950s-produced cartoon shorts depicting the character as a \"family man\".<ref>Officially, Disney's Guest Services once declared there to be \"no definitive answer\" as to \"who Max's mother is and where \"Mrs. Goofy\" went\", leaving her fate up to unofficial speculation and presumption. {{cite web|url=http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 |title=Disney FAQ: Who was the mother of Goofy's son Max? |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]] |accessdate=2014-07-31 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810155058/http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Disneyland IMG 3970.jpg|thumb|right|Goofy's house at [[Disneyland]].]]\n\nIn the comics, Goofy usually appears as Mickey's sidekick, though he also is occasionally shown as a protagonist.<ref>[https://inducks.org/comp2.php?code=&keyw=&keywt=i&exactpg=&pg1=&pg2=&bro2=&bro3=&exactparts=&parts1=&parts2=&kind=nk&rowsperpage=0&columnsperpage=0&hero=&xapp=Goofy&univ=&xa2=&creat=&creat2=&plot=&plot2=&writ=&writ2=&art=&art2=&ink=&ink2=&excludeCZ=on&pub1=1900&pub2=&ser=&xref=&mref=&xrefd=&repabb=&repabbc=al&imgmode=0&vdesc2=on&vdesc=en&vus=on&sort1=s.firstpublicationdate Chronological list of Goofy's appearances in comics] according to the [[INDUCKS]] database.

As such, he threatened constantly to terminate the series, but only continued it to provide [[make-work]] for his animators.<ref name=\"micechat\">{{cite web |url=http://micechat.com/forums/news/42925-disneytim-talks-walt-disney-historian-neal-gabler-micechat-news-team-10-29-06-a.html |title=Disneytim Talks with Walt Disney Historian Neal Gabler \u2013 MiceChat News Team, 10/29/06 |publisher=micechat.com |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}</ref> Animation historian [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] is skeptical of Gabler's claim, saying that his source did not correspond with what was written.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Commentary/Gabler/GablerErrata.htm |author= Barrier, Michael |date= December 2006 |title= 'Walt Disney's Errors and Ambiguities' |publisher= MichaelBarrier.com |accessdate= May 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Goofy Debut.PNG|left|thumb|250px|Goofy, anonymous in his debut cartoon, ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'' (1932).]]\n\nGoofy first appeared in ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'', first released on May 25, 1932. Directed by [[Wilfred Jackson]] this short movie features [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Horace Horsecollar]] and [[Clarabelle Cow]] performing another song and dance show. Mickey and his gang's animated shorts by this point routinely featured song and dance numbers. It begins as a typical Mickey cartoon of the time, but what would set this short apart from all that had come before was the appearance of a new character, whose behavior served as a running gag. Dippy Dawg, as he was named by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] artists (Frank Webb), was a member of the audience. He constantly irritated his fellow spectators by noisily crunching peanuts and laughing loudly, until two of those fellow spectators knocked him out with their mallets (and then did the same exact laugh as he did). This early version of Goofy had other differences with the later and more developed ones besides the name. He was an old man with a white beard, a puffy tail, and no trousers, shorts, or undergarments. But the short introduced Goofy's distinct laughter. This laughter was provided by [[Pinto Colvig]]. A considerably younger Dippy Dawg then appeared in ''[[The Whoopee Party]]'', first released on September 17, 1932, as a party guest and a friend of Mickey and his gang. Dippy Dawg made a total of four appearances in 1932 and two more in 1933, but most of them were mere [[Cameo appearance|cameos]].\n\nIn the Silly Symphonies cartoon ''[[The Grasshopper and the Ants (film)|The Grasshopper and the Ants]],'' the Grasshopper had an aloof character similar to Goofy and shared the same voice (Pinto Colvig) as the Goofy character.\n\nBy his seventh appearance, in ''[[Orphan's Benefit]]'' first released on August 11, 1934, he gained the new name \"Goofy\" and became a regular member of the gang along with two other new characters: [[Donald Duck]] and [[Clara Cluck]].\n\n===Trio years with Mickey and Donald===\n''[[Mickey's Service Station]]'' directed by [[Ben Sharpsteen]], first released on March 16, 1935, was the first of the classic \"Mickey, Donald, and Goofy\" comedy shorts. Those films had the trio trying to cooperate in performing a certain assignment given to them. Early on they became separated from each other. Then the short's focus started alternating between each of them facing the problems at hand, each in their own way and distinct style of comedy. The end of the short would reunite the three to share the fruits of their efforts, failure more often than success. ''[[Clock Cleaners]]'', first released on October 15, 1937, and ''[[Lonesome Ghosts]]'', first released on December 24, 1937, are usually considered the highlights of this series and animated classics.\n\nProgressively during the series, Mickey's part diminished in favor of Donald, Goofy, and Pluto. The reason for this was simple: Between the easily frustrated Donald and Pluto and the always-living-in-a-world-of-his-own Goofy, Mickey\u2014who became progressively gentler and more laid-back\u2014seemed to act as the [[double act|straight man]] of the trio. The studio's artists found that it had become easier coming up with new gags for Goofy or Donald than Mickey, to a point that Mickey's role had become unnecessary. ''[[Polar Trappers]]'', first released on June 17, 1938, was the first film to feature Goofy and Donald as a duo. The short features the duo as partners and owners of \"Donald and Goofy Trapping Co.\" They have settled in the [[Arctic]] for an unspecified period of time, to capture live [[walrus]]es to bring back to civilization. Their food supplies consist of [[canning|canned]] [[bean]]s. The focus shifts between Goofy trying to set traps for walruses and Donald trying to catch [[penguin]]s to use as food&nbsp;\u2014 both with the same lack of success. Mickey would return in ''[[The Whalers]]'', first released on August 19, 1938, but this and also ''Tugboat Mickey'', released on April 26, 1940, would be the last two shorts to feature all three characters as a team.\n\n===Break off into solo series===\nGoofy next starred at his first solo cartoon ''[[Goofy and Wilbur]]'' directed by [[Dick Huemer]], first released on March 17, 1939. The short featured Goofy fishing with the help of Wilbur, his pet [[grasshopper]].\n\n===The ''How to...'' series===\n[[File:Disney drawing goofy.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Walt Disney|Disney]] drawing Goofy for a group of girls in Argentina, 1941.]]\nIn 1938, one year after his last session as the character, Colvig had a falling out with Disney and left the studio, leaving Goofy without a voice.<ref name=\"Hischak\"/> According to [[Leonard Maltin]], this is what caused the ''How to...'' cartoons of the 1940s in which Goofy had little dialogue, and a narrator (often John McLeish) was used (they would also reuse Colvig's voice in recording or hire a man named Danny Webb to imitate it). In the cartoons, Goofy would demonstrate clumsily but always determined and never frustrated, how to do everything from snow ski to sleeping, to football, to riding a horse. The Goofy ''How to...'' cartoons worked so well that they became a staple format, and are still used in current Goofy shorts, the most recent being the ''How to Hook Up Your Home Theater'', released theatrically in 2007.\n\nLater, starting with ''[[How to Play Baseball]]'' (1942), Goofy starred in a series of cartoons where ''every'' single character in the cartoon was a different version of Goofy. This took Goofy out of the role of just being a clumsy cartoon character and into an Everyman figure. Colvig returned to Disney in 1940 and resumed the voice of Goofy three years later.<ref name=\"Hischak\"/> Many of the Goofy cartoons were directed by [[Jack Kinney]].\n\n===[[World War II]]===\n{{expand section|date=November 2015|more information about Goofy during World War II}}\nDuring World War II Goofy was drafted and became the mascot emblem of the [[602nd Bombardment Squadron]] and the [[756th Air Refueling Squadron|756 Bombardment Squadron]] U.S. Air Corps.\n<gallery>\nFile:602d Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png|<center>[[602nd Bombardment Squadron]] emblem (approved 6 March 1944)<ref name=Maurer602BS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons '', pp. 680-681</ref></center>\nFile:756th Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png|<center>[[756th Bombardment Squadron]] emblem</center>\n</gallery>\n\n===The ''Everyman'' years===\n[[File:Geefgoof.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Goofy in his \"George Geef\" persona in {{nowrap|''Cold War''}} (1951).]]\n\nThe 1950s saw Goofy transformed into a family man going through the trials of everyday life, such as dieting, giving up smoking, and the problems of raising children. Walt Disney himself came up with this idea,<ref>Harry Tytle ''One Of \"Walt's Boys,\"'' (Mission Viejo, 1997) pg 86</ref> hoping it would put personality back into the character that he felt was lost when Goofy was merely a crowd of extras. Goofy is never called \"Goofy\" during this period. While every cartoon continued with the opening, \"''Walt Disney presents Goofy''\" before each cartoon's title, he was usually called \"George Geef\" in the cartoons' dialogue. When the stories featured Goofy as multiple characters, then he had numerous other names as well. In addition, the 1950s Goofy shorts gave Goofy a makeover. He was more intelligent, had smaller eyes with eyebrows, often his whole body was pale instead of just his face (while the rest was black), and sometimes had a normal voice. He even lacked his droopy ears, the external pair of teeth and white gloves in some shorts.\n\nAccording to animation historian Christopher P. Lehman, Disney had started casting Goofy as a [[suburb]]an [[everyman]] in the late 1940s. And with this role came changes in depiction. Goofy's facial stubble and his protruding teeth were removed to give him a more refined look.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 27-28</ref> His clothing changed from a [[casual attire|casual style]] to wearing [[business suits]]. He began to look more human and less dog-like, with his ears hidden in his hat.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> By 1951, Goofy was portrayed as being married and having a son of his own. Neither the wife nor the son was portrayed as dog-like. The wife's face was never seen, but her form was human. The son lacked Goofy's dog-like ears.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/>\n\nLehman connects this depiction of the character to Disney's use of humor and animal characters to reinforce social [[conformity]]. He cites as an example ''[[Aquamania]]'' (1961), where everyman Goofy drives to the lake for a boat ride. During a scene depicting a [[Multiple-vehicle collision|pile-up accident]], every car involved has a boat hitched to its rear bumper. Goofy is portrayed as one of the numerous people who had the same idea about how to spend their day. Every contestant in the boat race also looks like Goofy.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> Lehman does not think that Disney used these aspects of the film to poke fun at conformity. Instead, the studio apparently accepted conformity as a fundamental aspect of the [[society of the United States]].<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> ''Aquamania'' was released in the 1960s, but largely maintained and prolonged the [[status quo]] of the 1950s. The decade had changed but the Disney studio followed the same story formulas for theatrical animated shorts it had followed in the previous decade. And Lehman points that Disney received [[Normative social influence|social approval]] for it. ''Aquamania'' itself received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]].<ref name=\"Lehman\"/>\n\n===Later appearances===\nAfter the 1965 educational film ''Goofy's Freeway Troubles'', Goofy was mostly retired except for cameos, because of the fading popularity, and the death of the voice actor [[Pinto Colvig]]. Goofy had an act in the 1969 tour show, [[Disney on Parade]] with costar [[Herbie|Herbie the Love Bug]]. He only makes a brief appearance in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Amblin Entertainment|Amblin]]'s Academy Award-winning hit ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', in which the titular [[Roger Rabbit]] says of Goofy: \"Nobody takes a whollup like Goofy! What timing! What finesse! What a genius!\". However, he made a comeback in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' as the ghost of Jacob Marley. After that, he appeared in ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' which was originally intended to be released theatrically in 1984 but was aired as a 1987 TV special instead. His popularity then rose again. With Colvig dead, Goofy was then voiced with different voice actors until [[Bill Farmer]] became the official voice.\n\n[[File:Goofymoviemain.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Goofy (right) with his son [[Max Goof|Max]] (left) in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995)]] \nIn the 1990s, Goofy got his own TV series called ''[[Goof Troop]]''. In the show, Goofy lives with his son [[Max Goof|Max]] and his cat Waffles, and they live next door to [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] and his family. ''Goof Troop'' eventually led to Goofy and Max starring in their own movies: ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (in 1995) and ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' (in 2000); as well as starring in their own segments of ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (in 1999) and ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (in 2004). While Goofy is clearly depicted as a single custodial parent in all of these appearances, by the end of ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' he begins a romance with the character Sylvia Marpole, Max being grown and in college by this point.\n\nIn one episode of ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'', Goofy has an off-screen cameo whose distinctive laugh is \"stolen\" by a disgruntled toon. In another episode, both he and Pete cameo as actors who film cartoons at Wackytoon Studios. And in a third episode, Goofy cameos as part of a group of civilians held hostage in a bank robbery.\n\nGoofy returned to his traditional personality in ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and appeared as a head waiter in ''[[House of Mouse]]'' (2001 to 2004). Goofy's son [[Max Goof|Max]] also appeared in ''House of Mouse'' as the nightclub's valet, so that Goofy juggled not only his conventional antics but also the father-role displayed in ''Goof Troop'' and its aforementioned related media. In both ''Mickey Mouse Works'' and ''House of Mouse'', Goofy also seemed to have a crush on [[Clarabelle Cow]], as he asks her on a date in the ''House of Mouse'' episode \"Super Goof\" and is stalked by the bovine in the [[Mickey Mouse Works]] cartoon \"How To Be a Spy\". Though Clarabelle was noted as [[Horace Horsecollar]]'s fianc\u00e9 in early decades, comics from the 1960s and 1970s and more recent cartoons like the aforementioned ''House of Mouse'' and ''Mickey Mouse Works'', as well as ''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]'', imply some mutual affections between Goofy and Clarabelle; perhaps as an attempt for Disney to give Goofy a more mainstream girlfriend to match his two male co-stars.\n\nOn [[Disney's Toontown Online]], an interactive website for kids, Goofy previously ran his own neighborhood called Goofy Speedway until the close of Toontown. Goofy Speedway was a place where you could race cars and enter the Grand Prix, too. Tickets were exclusively spent on everything there, instead of the usual jellybean currency. The Grand Prix only came on \"Grand Prix Monday\" and \"Silly Saturday\". Goofy's Gag Shop was also found in almost every part of Toontown' except Cog HQs, Goofy Speedway, or Chip & Dale's Acorn Acres. At Goofy's Gag Shop, Toons could buy gags.\n\nGoofy also appears in the [[children's television series]], ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', with his trademark attire and personality. Goofy appeared in ''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]''. Recently, Goofy starred in a new theatrical cartoon short called ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]]'', that premiered at the [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]]. The short received a positive review from animation historian [[Jerry Beck]]<ref name=\"cartoonbrew\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/events/report-from-ottawa |title=Report from Ottawa: Persepolis and Goofy &#124; Cartoon Brew |publisher=cartoonbrew.com |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204045016/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/events/report-from-ottawa |archivedate=December 4, 2008 }}</ref> and then had a wide release on December 21, 2007, in front of ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]'' and has aired on several occasions on the Disney Channel.\n\nIn 2011, Goofy appeared in a promotional webtoon advertising [[Disney Cruise Line]].<ref name=\"cartoonbrew2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/advertising/checkin-in-with-goofy.html|title=\"Checkin' In With Goofy\"  &#124; Cartoon Brew|publisher=cartoonbrew.com|accessdate=July 11, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215140838/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/advertising/checkin-in-with-goofy.html|archivedate=February 15, 2012}}</ref> He is also a main character on ''[[Mickey and the Roadster Racers]].''

In the early years, the other members of Mickey Mouse's gang considered him a meddler and a pest but eventually warmed up to him.\n\nThe [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip]] drawn by [[Floyd Gottfredson]] was generally based on what was going on in the Mickey Mouse shorts at the time, but when Donald Duck's popularity led to Donald Duck gaining [[Donald Duck (comic strip)|his own newspaper strip]], Disney decided that he was no longer allowed to appear in Gottfredson's strips. Accordingly, Goofy remained alone as Mickey's sidekick, replacing [[Horace Horsecollar]] as Mickey's fellow adventurer and companion. Similarly in comics, the Mickey Mouse world with Goofy as Mickey's sidekick was usually very separate from the Donald Duck world and crossovers were rare.\nGoofy also has a characteristic habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth, a trademark that was introduced by [[Paul Murry]].\n\nA character called \"Glory-Bee\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/glorybee.html |title=Glory-Bee |publisher=Users.cwnet.com |accessdate=2014-08-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313131713/http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/glorybee.html |archivedate=2015-03-13 }}</ref> was Goofy's girlfriend for some years.\n\nIn 1990, when Disney was publishing [[Disney Comics (publishing)|their own comics]], Goofy starred in ''[[Goofy Adventures]]'', that featured him starring in various parodies. Unfortunately, perhaps because of poor sales, ''Goofy Adventures'' was the first of the company's titles to be canceled by the Disney Comics Implosion, ending at its 17th issue.\n\n===Super Goof===\n{{Infobox comics character<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image         =\n| caption       =\n| character_name = Super Goof\n| real_name     = Goofy\n| publisher     = [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Co.]] (licenser)<br />[[Western Publishing]] (licensee)\n| debut='''First version''': \"The Phantom Blot meets Super Goof\" (''Walt Disney's The Phantom Blot'' #2, Feb. 1965)<br />'''Second version''': \"All's Well that Ends Awful\" (''[[Donald Duck (American comic book)|Donald Duck]]'' #102, July 1965)<br />'''Third and definitive version''': \"The Thief of Zanzipar\" (''Walt Disney Super Goof'' #1, Oct. 1965)\n| creators      = Del Connell (script, first two versions)<br />[[Bob Ogle]] (script, third and definitive version)<br />[[Paul Murry]] (art, all three versions)\n| alliances     = Super Gilbert\n| previous_alliances =\n| aliases      =\n| powers       = Can fly, has x-ray vision, invulnerability, super strength, super speed, superbreath, and other powers\n}}\n\n'''Super Goof''' is Goofy's [[superhero]] alter ego who gets his powers by eating super [[goobers]] (peanuts).

His attire was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]].]]\n\nGoofy is the captain of the royal guard at Disney Castle in the [[Kingdom Hearts|''Kingdom Hearts'' video game series]]. Averse to using actual weapons, Goofy fights with a shield. Following a letter left by the missing king Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Donald, the court magician, meet [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] and embark on a quest with him to find the King and Sora's missing friends. In the game series, Goofy still suffers from being the butt of comic relief, but also is the constant voice of optimism and, surprisingly, selectively perceptive, often noticing things others miss and keeping his cool when Sora and Donald lose it. Goofy's loyalty was also tested when Riku wielded the Keyblade thus, following the king's orders, he followed Riku instead. As Riku was about to attack Sora, Goofy used his shield to protect Sora; thus disobeying the king. When Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter the realm known as Timeless River, Goofy states that the world looks familiar; a reference to his cartoons done in the early to mid-1930s. At many times in the'' Kingdom Hearts'' series, Goofy is shown to still be his clumsy self, however, in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', he is very keen to details and has very accurate assumptions of certain things. For example, he was the first to figure out why [[Organization XIII]] was after the [[Beast (Disney character)|Beast]], and he was the first to see through [[Mulan (Disney character)|Fa Mulan]]'s disguise and discovery that Mulan was actually a woman dressed as a male soldier. There were even several instances where Goofy seemed to have more common sense than Sora and Donald, even saying they should \"look before we leap\" when Sora and Donald saw [[Mushu]]'s shadow resembling a dragon, that Sora had mistaken for a Heartless.\n\nGoofy reappears in the prequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'', in a relatively minor role, having accompanied Mickey (along with Donald) to Yen Sid's tower to watch Mickey's Mark of Mastery Exam. Upon realizing that Mickey has been abducted and taken to the Keyblade Graveyard by Master Xehanort in an attempt to lure Ventus out, Goofy and Donald prepare to venture out to rescue Mickey, but as they will obviously be no match for Master Xehanort, Ventus goes alone. Donald and Goofy later care for their King as he recuperates from his injuries.\n\n===In other video games===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}{{Update section|date=March 2020}}\n\n*Goofy was the star of an early platformer, ''Matterhorn Screamer'' for the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]].\n\n* Goofy appears as the owner (or perhaps simply the cashier) of the \"Junk\" store in ''[[Donald Duck's Playground]]'', developed and published in the 1980s by Sierra On-Line for the Commodore 64, IBM PC, Apple II, Amiga, and Atari ST.\n\n* Goofy also starred in [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] action game ''[[Goof Troop (video game)|Goof Troop]]'' alongside his son [[Max Goof|Max]] and in ''[[Goofy's Hysterical History Tour]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]] where he's ahead janitor and he must recover the missing pieces of some museum exhibits.\n\n* Goofy appears briefly in ''[[Quackshot]]'', a Genesis game that starred Donald Duck. Goofy is located within the ancient ruins in Mexico and gives Donald the red plunger (an upgrade to Donald's plunger gun allows the climbing of walls) and a strange note that solves a puzzle in Egypt later in the game.\n\n* He also was in the [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] game ''[[Disney's Party]]'' as one of the playable characters.\n\n* Two games for kids were released: ''[[Goofy's Fun House]]'' for the [[PlayStation]] and ''Goofy's Railway Express'' for the [[Commodore 64]].\n\n* He also appears 2001 in ''[[Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding]]'' for [[Personal computer|PC]].\n\n* Goofy is a playable character in ''[[Disney TH!NK Fast]]''.\n\n* Concept art for Goofy was made for his appearance in the 2009 & 2010 [[Wii]] game, ''[[Epic Mickey]]''. He appears as one of the \"buddies\" that the Mad Doctor creates for [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] to replicate the facade of Mickey Mouse's success. A variation of him seems to appear as a minor shopkeeper named Tiki Sam.\n\n* Goofy briefly appears in ''[[Disney's Magical Quest]]'' for Super NES, released in 1992.\n\n* As noted above, Goofy appears in Disney's online game ''[[Toontown Online]]''.\n\n* Goofy was also a playable character in ''[[Disney Golf]]'' for the PS2.\n\n* Goofy is one the eight playable racers in the [[GBA]] game ''Disney Kart: Circuit Tour''.\n\n==Voice actors==\n[[Pinto Colvig]] voiced Goofy for most of his classic appearances from 1932 (''[[Mickey's Revue]]'') to 1938 (''[[The Whalers]]'') when he had a fallout with Disney and left the company to work on other projects. He was later replaced by Danny Webb from 1939 to 1941.<ref name=Canemaker/> However, Colvig returned to Disney and resumed the role in 1944 (''How to Be a Sailor'') until shortly before his death in 1967.

Colvig also gave Goofy a normal voice for four George Geef. [[Stuart Buchanan]] voiced Goofy in ''[[The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air]]''.

He first appeared in the 1992 television series ''[[Goof Troop]]'' and stars in both the spin-off film ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995) and its [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' (2000). He also features in the direct-to-video ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (1999), its sequel ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (2004), and the 2001 TV series ''[[House of Mouse]]''.

He also does this in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' games.\n\nThe holler is also used in films and cartoons in which Goofy does not appear, generally in situations that are particularly \"goofy\" (examples include ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]'', ''[[The Rescuers]]'', ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', ''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]'', ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'', and ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'').\n\nIn a ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode titled \"The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne\", the Joker performs the holler when the plane crashes toward a canyon.\n\nIn the \"Wacky Delly\" episode of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', the holler is heard at the end of the haphazardly made cartoon created by [[Rocko]], [[Heffer Wolfe]], and [[Filburt]] for Ralph Bighead.\n\nA version of the holler is used in a cutaway in the \"[[Dial Meg for Murder]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when Goofy is cast into [[Hell]] for causing [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].\n\nThe term \"Goofy Holler\" was first created by a user of the [[Internet Movie Database]] and originated on the trivia page for ''[[A Goofy Movie]]''.

Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] opened its new railway station in 2003, on the [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] that had closed to passengers in 1969.\n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n* Passenger service on the [[Portishead Railway]] stopped in 1964; plans are to reopen it as far as [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], possibly in 2023. Freight services ceased in 1981 (unrelated to Beeching) and resumed on part of the line in 2002.\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n\n===East Midlands===\n* The [[Robin Hood Line]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], between [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]] via [[Mansfield railway station (England)|Mansfield]], reopened in the early 1990s.  Previously Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line|Lincoln to Peterborough line]]. The section between Peterborough and Spalding closed to passengers on 5 October 1970 and reopened on 7 June 1971.\n* North of [[Sleaford railway station|Sleaford]], [[Ruskington railway station|Ruskington station]] reopened on 5 May 1975 and [[Metheringham railway station|Metheringham Station]] reopened on 6 October 1975.\n* The [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]] to Melton Mowbray Line via [[Corby railway station|Corby]] and Oakham closed to passengers on 18 April 1966. A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009, with a direct train to London that terminates at Corby, with a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}. The [[Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line|line towards Kidderminster and Worcester]] was reopened to Snow Hill in 1995. \n* The line from [[Birmingham Snow Hill \u2013 Wolverhampton Low Level Line|Snow Hill to Wolverhampton]] reopened as the [[Midland Metro]] [[tram]] system.  Despite the successful and potential reopening of many rail routes as light-rail and metro lines, the concept is still under threat due to the varying popularity of these schemes with successive governments.\n* The line from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Bicester Village railway station|Bicester]] reopened in 1987 after closing in 1968\n* The line from [[Coventry to Nuneaton Line|Coventry to Nuneaton]] reopened to passengers in 1988. \n* The [[Chase Line|Walsall\u2013Hednesford line]] reopened to passengers in 1989, and was extended to [[Rugeley Town railway station|Rugeley]] in 1997. Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds. Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[South Staffordshire Line]] between Stourbridge and Walsall is set to reopen as a part of the Midland Metro expansion scheme. The line will be shared between trams and freight trains.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n* A new station was opened in [[Kenilworth railway station|Kenilworth]] on 30 April 2018.\n\n===North West===\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].  The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\n* Stopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan, Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]]. Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened. This was the 77th new or reopened station in Scotland since 1970. Others include {{Stnlnk|Gretna Green}}, {{Stnlnk|Dyce}} and {{Stnlnk|New Cumnock}}, all of which had been closed in the mid-1960s. {{stnlink|Kintore}} is due to reopen in 2020.\n* The Edinburgh to Bathgate route opened in 1985, as single track. The line was doubled, electrified and extended beyond Bathgate to Airdrie in 2010, creating a fourth route between Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n* A 35-mile (56&nbsp;km) stretch of the former [[Waverley Route]] between [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] and {{Stnlnk|Tweedbank}} via Galashiels [[Borders Railway|reopened]] on 6 September 2015. The closure of the line in 1969 had left the [[Scottish Borders]] without any rail links.\n*{{Stnlnk|Beauly}} (2006) and {{Stnlnk|Conon Bridge}} (2015) were reopened on the Far North Line between Inverness and Dingwall.\n\n==Heritage railways==\n{{see|List of British heritage and private railways}}\n\n==Further proposals==\n{{As of|2019||df=}}, proposals being pursued include:\n\n* [[Camp Hill

Despite the successful and potential reopening of many rail routes as light-rail and metro lines, the concept is still under threat due to the varying popularity of these schemes with successive governments.\n* The line from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Bicester Village railway station|Bicester]] reopened in 1987 after closing in 1968\n* The line from [[Coventry to Nuneaton Line|Coventry to Nuneaton]] reopened to passengers in 1988. \n* The [[Chase Line|Walsall\u2013Hednesford line]] reopened to passengers in 1989, and was extended to [[Rugeley Town railway station|Rugeley]] in 1997. Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds. Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[South Staffordshire Line]] between Stourbridge and Walsall is set to reopen as a part of the Midland Metro expansion scheme. The line will be shared between trams and freight trains.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n* A new station was opened in [[Kenilworth railway station|Kenilworth]] on 30 April 2018.\n\n===North West===\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].  The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\nStopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan, Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]]. Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened. This was the 77th new or reopened station in Scotland since 1970. Others include {{Stnlnk|Gretna Green}}, {{Stnlnk|Dyce}} and {{Stnlnk|New Cumnock}}, all of which had been closed in the mid-1960s. {{stnlink|Kintore}} is due to reopen in 2020.\n* The Edinburgh to Bathgate route opened in 1985, as single track. The line was doubled, electrified and extended beyond Bathgate to Airdrie in 2010, creating a fourth route between Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n* A 35-mile (56&nbsp;km) stretch of the former [[Waverley Route]] between [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] and {{Stnlnk|Tweedbank}} via Galashiels [[Borders Railway|reopened]] on 6 September 2015. The closure of the line in 1969 had left the [[Scottish Borders]] without any rail links.\n*{{Stnlnk|Beauly}} (2006) and {{Stnlnk|Conon Bridge}} (2015) were reopened on the Far North Line between Inverness and Dingwall.\n\n==Heritage railways==\n{{see|List of British heritage and private railways}}\n\n==Further proposals==\n{{As of|2019||df=}}, proposals being pursued include:\n\n* [[Camp Hill
