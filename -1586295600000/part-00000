This examination procedure is regulated in Chapter 19 of the VerfO. The condition for this is that the state explicitly rejected this when ratifying the treaty (Article 28 (1) FoK).<ref>{{cite web|title=R\u00f6mer Statut des Internationalen Strafgerichtshofs|publisher=Hrsg: [[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]] (LILEX)|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/2002090000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe state is asked by the committee to participate in the investigation proceedings and to provide information on these suspicions (Article 20 (1) FoK, Rule 82 et seq. First of all, the information received is examined (Rule 81 et seq. Of the VerfO) and, if the suspicion has been substantiated, an investigation is carried out, in which case the Committee can also conduct investigations in the affected state if the state agrees. Upon completion of the investigation, the committee will send the investigation report to the State concerned and, if it finds any instances of [[maladministration]], appropriate recommendations on how to remedy them (Rule 89 RCD).\n\nTo date, 10 such studies have been performed. [18] These were: Egypt (2017), [[Lebanon]] (2014), [[Nepal]] (2012), [[Brazil]] (2008), [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (2004), [[Mexico]] (2003), [[Sri Lanka]] (2002), [[Peru]] (2001), [[Egypt]] (1996), [[Turkey]] (1994)\n\nThe recommendations of the committee are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced. Apart from the fact that he can carry out a follow-up procedure<ref name=\"Working_methods_Follow-up_to_concluding_observations\" /><ref name=\"Follow-up_to_concluding_observations_procedure\" /> to review the implementation of the recommendations or that the implementation of the recommendations will be discussed in the next state report, no further measures are foreseen (Article 20 (5) FoK, Rule 90).\n\nIf the committee is confronted with such serious or systematic torture by a state, it may also bring the matter to the attention of the UN General Assembly. The latter then decides on the further course of action, because extensive or systematic violations of the torture prohibition are considered crimes against humanity according to Art. 7 (1) of the Rome Statute  and the International Criminal Court in The Hague is responsible for this, provided that the fallible state does not [[International Criminal Court]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|periodical=[[Vertragssammlung der Vereinten Nationen|Vertragssammlung der UNO]]|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XVIII-10&chapter=18&clang=_en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==State cases==\nThis procedure is regulated in Chapter 20 of the VerfO. The Committee is empowered to consider cases of State where a Contracting State claims that another State Party is failing to fulfill its obligations under the Convention against Torture (Article 21 FoK). The condition for this is that both states explicitly recognized the competence of the committee when ratifying the treaty (Article 21 (1) FoK, Rule 91, 97 VerO).\n\nIn contrast to individual complaints, there are no high formal requirements for state complaints, and the UNHCHR Secretariat is not authorized to declare state complaints inadmissible, as in the case of individual complaints (Art. 22 (5) FoK Individual Complaints, Rule 111 ff.\n\nThe task of the committee is to settle the dispute (Article 21 (1) lit e FoK, Rule 98 of the Rules of Procedure). If no amicable agreement is reached, a final report will be prepared, completing the procedure for the committee (Article 21 (1) (h), (ii) FoK, Rule 101 of the VerfO).

Ireland could not file the complaint with either the CAT or the CCPR (Article 7 IpbpR), as they did not enter into force until about 10 years later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Europ\u00e4isches \u00dcbereinkommen zur friedlichen Beilegung von Streitigkeiten|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1980061000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===Note to this judgment of the ECtHR and the consequences (Guantanamo, Abu Graib)===\n\nIn its [[torture memos]] on the torture methods in [[Guantanamo]], etc.,<ref>{{cite web|title=Legal Brief on Proposed Counter-Resistance Strategies|periodical=Torture Memos|publisher=Hrsg: Departement of Defense der USA|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/policy/dod/d20040622doc3.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=Diane E.

Art. 22 FoK are euphemistically referred to as communications (individual communications versus state-to-state complaints). If a state expressly agrees with the individual complaints procedure at the time of conclusion of the contract, the committee may also examine individual complaints against that contracting state (Art. 22 (1) FoK, Rule 102 VerfO).<ref>{{cite web|title=Model complaint form|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/ComplaintFormOPICCPR_CAT_CERD.doc|format=doc|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe procedures of the appeal proceedings are listed in Chapter 21 of the VerfO, as well as the formal requirements for the individual complaints (Rule 104 RMA) and the condition for their admissibility (Rule 113 RPS). The UNHCHR created a complaint form (English: Model complaint form) and a related information sheet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet No. 17 Informationsblatt \u00fcber das Beschwerdeverfahren|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet17en.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe complaint must be in writing, it must not be anonymous and must be written in one of the working languages of the committee; for this, the national legal process must be unsuccessful. Only then can a complaint be lodged with the committee, a period for appeal is not provided, but usually a complaint is not accepted after five years (ratione temporis). The complaint may be dismissed on the grounds that the committee has no jurisdiction, since the alleged infringement is not part of the FoK (ratione materiae) or it constitutes an abuse of the right of appeal. The same complaint may not be lodged with any other international body (e.g. the ECtHR, another UN treaty body or similar) (Article 22 (5) of the FoK, Rule 104, 113 of the Rules of Procedure).\n\nComplaints submitted to the UN are first formally reviewed by the Secretariat of UNHCHR. Then the complaint is either rejected or registered and forwarded to the committee (Rule 104. VerfO). There are no statistics on the number of complaints already rejected by the Secretariat.\n\nIf the complaint was rejected by the secretariat, the complainant will be notified in a standard letter. It uses the same form for rejecting the complaint filed with the CERD, CAT and the CCPR, in which mostly inadequate justification is ticked, although this is not provided for and instead information would have to be obtained (Rule 105 RCD). If the complaint has been received, the secretariat will prepare a summary - which may alienate the complaint - and forward it to the committee (Rule 106 RMA). The committee then examines the material admissibility of the complaint / summary (Article 22 (5) FoK, Rule 113, 116 VerO). If he declared the appeal inadmissible, then he - unlike the Secretariat - justified his decision of inadmissibility of the appeal. If it has been approved, the summary will be forwarded to the State concerned for comment, which may then raise the objection of inadmissibility (Rule 115 RCD). The committee also tries to reach an amicable agreement. If the State party so agrees, this will be decided in a decision (Discontinuance Decision) and the case is settled.\n\nOnly later does he deal with the complaint in terms of content (Rule 118 VerfO). If the committee has found a breach of contract, it gives the state proposals and recommendations on how to remedy them (Article 22 (7) FoK).<ref name=\"Follow-up_Reports_to_the_Complaints_Procedure\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Follow-up to concluding observations|publisher=Hrsg: CAT|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/TreatyBodyExternal/FollowUp.aspx?Treaty=CAT&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe recommendations are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced, only a follow-up procedure is planned, in which the implementation of the recommendations is examined by the state and, where appropriate, it will be discussed in the next state reporting procedure. Sanctions are not provided against fallible states. Although in the preamble of FoK the torture ban acc. Art. 7 IPbpR was given as a basis and according to Art. 4 para. 2 IpBPR the prohibition of tort is mandatory international law - it has no consequences for the fallible state, the CAT is only recommended to stop it.\n\n===Precautionary measures===\nWhen lodging the complaint, interim measures may be required at the same time in the event of irreparable harm. Such requests must be submitted as soon as possible, with the reference Urgent Interim measures, so that the committee has sufficient time to consider the request and order such action. The Committee can also take precautionary measures on its own initiative, but they do not make a decision on the admissibility of the complaint or on the finding of a failure by the State (Rule 114 RCD).\n\n===Complaints to the CAT and the ECHR===\nA complaint, for example, for a violation of the prohibition of torture pursuant to Art. 7 IPbpR, Art. 1 FoK and Art. 3 ECHR may not be filed simultaneously with the committee, the ECtHR] or another UN treaty body, so-called \"same-subject reservation\" (Art. 22 para. 5 lit. a FoK). However, it is permissible for the committee to file a complaint for infringement of Art. 1 FoK Breach of the Torture Prohibition and to file a complaint with the ECtHR for breach of Art. 11 ECHR Freedom of assembly and association, as there is no overlap but concerns various breaches of contract by the same state .<ref>{{cite web|title=Application CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1 by Walter Franz Leopold JEDINGER against Austria|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=CAT|quote=that the same matter has not been, examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement. (...) the author has submitted the same matter to the ECHR, which has registered the case as application No. 16121/90}}</ref>\n\nThere are complaints that were first filed with, but not accepted by, the ECtHR, with the standard justification: the complaint has no appearance of violations of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention (ECHR) or its Additional Protocols. The complaint subsequently submitted to the UN Committee was then rejected on the ground that it had allegedly been examined by the ECtHR although the ECtHR did not substantively examine the complaint, but did not accept it.\n\nCorrespondingly, the decision no. 577/2013 [85] of the CAT Committee of 9 February 2016, i.S. N.B. c. Russia for torture. At the same time, the complainant had filed an identical complaint with the ECtHR (No. 33772/13), which was why the CAT committee rejected the complaint (see decision RZ 8.2). However, in the judgment database HUDOC of the ECHR there is no judgment with the no. 33772/13, as the complaint was refused by the Registry and removed from the register - thus not examined by the ECtHR.\n\nIn the meantime, there are decisions from the committee in which he nevertheless examined such complaints.\n\n==General remarks==\n\nThe Committee publishes general comments on the interpretation and specification of the various provisions of the Torture Convention. They are intended to clear up misunderstandings and to assist the contracting states in the fulfillment of their contractual obligations. To date, the committee has written four General Comments (GC).\n* GC No. 1 (1997): Implementation of Art. 3 FoK (Refoulement Prohibition) in connection with Art. 22 FoK Individual complaints\n* GC No. 2 Implementation of Art. 2 FoK Prevention of Torture\n* GC No. 3 (2012) Implementation of Art. 14 FoK Reparation\n* GC No. 4 (2017) Implementation of Art. 3 FoK (refoulement prohibition) in connection with Art. 22 FoK Individual complaints\n\n==Members of the CAT==\nThe members appointed under Art. 17 FoK for 4 years each\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This examination procedure is regulated in Chapter 19 of the VerfO. The condition for this is that the state explicitly rejected this when ratifying the treaty (Article 28 (1) FoK).<ref>{{cite web|title=R\u00f6mer Statut des Internationalen Strafgerichtshofs|publisher=Hrsg: [[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]] (LILEX)|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/2002090000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe state is asked by the committee to participate in the investigation proceedings and to provide information on these suspicions (Article 20 (1) FoK, Rule 82 et seq. First of all, the information received is examined (Rule 81 et seq. Of the VerfO) and, if the suspicion has been substantiated, an investigation is carried out, in which case the Committee can also conduct investigations in the affected state if the state agrees. Upon completion of the investigation, the committee will send the investigation report to the State concerned and, if it finds any instances of [[maladministration]], appropriate recommendations on how to remedy them (Rule 89 RCD).\n\nTo date, 10 such studies have been performed. [18] These were: Egypt (2017), [[Lebanon]] (2014), [[Nepal]] (2012), [[Brazil]] (2008), [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (2004), [[Mexico]] (2003), [[Sri Lanka]] (2002), [[Peru]] (2001), [[Egypt]] (1996), [[Turkey]] (1994)\n\nThe recommendations of the committee are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced. Apart from the fact that he can carry out a follow-up procedure<ref name=\"Working_methods_Follow-up_to_concluding_observations\" /><ref name=\"Follow-up_to_concluding_observations_procedure\" /> to review the implementation of the recommendations or that the implementation of the recommendations will be discussed in the next state report, no further measures are foreseen (Article 20 (5) FoK, Rule 90).\n\nIf the committee is confronted with such serious or systematic torture by a state, it may also bring the matter to the attention of the UN General Assembly. The latter then decides on the further course of action, because extensive or systematic violations of the torture prohibition are considered crimes against humanity according to Art. 7 (1) of the Rome Statute  and the International Criminal Court in The Hague is responsible for this, provided that the fallible state does not [[International Criminal Court]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|periodical=[[Vertragssammlung der Vereinten Nationen|Vertragssammlung der UNO]]|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XVIII-10&chapter=18&clang=_en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==State cases==\nThis procedure is regulated in Chapter 20 of the VerfO. The Committee is empowered to consider cases of State where a Contracting State claims that another State Party is failing to fulfill its obligations under the Convention against Torture (Article 21 FoK). The condition for this is that both states explicitly recognized the competence of the committee when ratifying the treaty (Article 21 (1) FoK, Rule 91, 97 VerO).\n\nIn contrast to individual complaints, there are no high formal requirements for state complaints, and the UNHCHR Secretariat is not authorized to declare state complaints inadmissible, as in the case of individual complaints (Art. 22 (5) FoK Individual Complaints, Rule 111 ff.\n\nThe task of the committee is to settle the dispute (Article 21 (1) lit e FoK, Rule 98 of the Rules of Procedure). If no amicable agreement is reached, a final report will be prepared, completing the procedure for the committee (Article 21 (1) (h), (ii) FoK, Rule 101 of the VerfO).

Ireland could not file the complaint with either the CAT or the CCPR (Article 7 IpbpR), as they did not enter into force until about 10 years later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Europ\u00e4isches \u00dcbereinkommen zur friedlichen Beilegung von Streitigkeiten|periodical=[[Liechtensteinische Gesetzessammlung]]|url=https://www.gesetze.li/konso/1980061000|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===Note to this judgment of the ECtHR and the consequences (Guantanamo, Abu Graib)===\n\nIn its [[torture memos]] on the torture methods in [[Guantanamo]], etc.,<ref>{{cite web|title=Legal Brief on Proposed Counter-Resistance Strategies|periodical=Torture Memos|publisher=Hrsg: Departement of Defense der USA|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/policy/dod/d20040622doc3.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=Diane E.

Art. 22 FoK are euphemistically referred to as communications (individual communications versus state-to-state complaints). If a state expressly agrees with the individual complaints procedure at the time of conclusion of the contract, the committee may also examine individual complaints against that contracting state (Art. 22 (1) FoK, Rule 102 VerfO).<ref>{{cite web|title=Model complaint form|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/ComplaintFormOPICCPR_CAT_CERD.doc|format=doc|accessdate=2019-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe procedures of the appeal proceedings are listed in Chapter 21 of the VerfO, as well as the formal requirements for the individual complaints (Rule 104 RMA) and the condition for their admissibility (Rule 113 RPS). The UNHCHR created a complaint form (English: Model complaint form) and a related information sheet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet No. 17 Informationsblatt \u00fcber das Beschwerdeverfahren|publisher=Hrsg: [[UN-Hochkommissariat f\u00fcr Menschenrechte|UNHCHR]]|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet17en.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe complaint must be in writing, it must not be anonymous and must be written in one of the working languages of the committee; for this, the national legal process must be unsuccessful. Only then can a complaint be lodged with the committee, a period for appeal is not provided, but usually a complaint is not accepted after five years (ratione temporis). The complaint may be dismissed on the grounds that the committee has no jurisdiction, since the alleged infringement is not part of the FoK (ratione materiae) or it constitutes an abuse of the right of appeal. The same complaint may not be lodged with any other international body (e.g. the ECtHR, another UN treaty body or similar) (Article 22 (5) of the FoK, Rule 104, 113 of the Rules of Procedure).\n\nComplaints submitted to the UN are first formally reviewed by the Secretariat of UNHCHR. Then the complaint is either rejected or registered and forwarded to the committee (Rule 104. VerfO). There are no statistics on the number of complaints already rejected by the Secretariat.\n\nIf the complaint was rejected by the secretariat, the complainant will be notified in a standard letter. It uses the same form for rejecting the complaint filed with the CERD, CAT and the CCPR, in which mostly inadequate justification is ticked, although this is not provided for and instead information would have to be obtained (Rule 105 RCD). If the complaint has been received, the secretariat will prepare a summary - which may alienate the complaint - and forward it to the committee (Rule 106 RMA). The committee then examines the material admissibility of the complaint / summary (Article 22 (5) FoK, Rule 113, 116 VerO). If he declared the appeal inadmissible, then he - unlike the Secretariat - justified his decision of inadmissibility of the appeal. If it has been approved, the summary will be forwarded to the State concerned for comment, which may then raise the objection of inadmissibility (Rule 115 RCD). The committee also tries to reach an amicable agreement. If the State party so agrees, this will be decided in a decision (Discontinuance Decision) and the case is settled.\n\nOnly later does he deal with the complaint in terms of content (Rule 118 VerfO). If the committee has found a breach of contract, it gives the state proposals and recommendations on how to remedy them (Article 22 (7) FoK).<ref name=\"Follow-up_Reports_to_the_Complaints_Procedure\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Follow-up to concluding observations|publisher=Hrsg: CAT|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/TreatyBodyExternal/FollowUp.aspx?Treaty=CAT&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe recommendations are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced, only a follow-up procedure is planned, in which the implementation of the recommendations is examined by the state and, where appropriate, it will be discussed in the next state reporting procedure. Sanctions are not provided against fallible states. Although in the preamble of FoK the torture ban acc. Art. 7 IPbpR was given as a basis and according to Art. 4 para. 2 IpBPR the prohibition of tort is mandatory international law - it has no consequences for the fallible state, the CAT is only recommended to stop it.\n\n===Precautionary measures===\nWhen lodging the complaint, interim measures may be required at the same time in the event of irreparable harm. Such requests must be submitted as soon as possible, with the reference Urgent Interim measures, so that the committee has sufficient time to consider the request and order such action. The Committee can also take precautionary measures on its own initiative, but they do not make a decision on the admissibility of the complaint or on the finding of a failure by the State (Rule 114 RCD).\n\n===Complaints to the CAT and the ECHR===\nA complaint, for example, for a violation of the prohibition of torture pursuant to Art. 7 IPbpR, Art. 1 FoK and Art. 3 ECHR may not be filed simultaneously with the committee, the ECtHR] or another UN treaty body, so-called \"same-subject reservation\" (Art. 22 para. 5 lit. a FoK). However, it is permissible for the committee to file a complaint for infringement of Art. 1 FoK Breach of the Torture Prohibition and to file a complaint with the ECtHR for breach of Art. 11 ECHR Freedom of assembly and association, as there is no overlap but concerns various breaches of contract by the same state .<ref>{{cite web|title=Application CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1 by Walter Franz Leopold JEDINGER against Austria|url=https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT/C/5/D/5/1990/Rev.1&Lang=en|accessdate=2019-04-03|last=CAT|quote=that the same matter has not been, examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement. (...) the author has submitted the same matter to the ECHR, which has registered the case as application No. 16121/90}}</ref>\n\nThere are complaints that were first filed with, but not accepted by, the ECtHR, with the standard justification: the complaint has no appearance of violations of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention (ECHR) or its Additional Protocols. The complaint subsequently submitted to the UN Committee was then rejected on the ground that it had allegedly been examined by the ECtHR although the ECtHR did not substantively examine the complaint, but did not accept it.\n\nCorrespondingly, the decision no. 577/2013 [85] of the CAT Committee of 9 February 2016, i.S. N.B. c. Russia for torture. At the same time, the complainant had filed an identical complaint with the ECtHR (No. 33772/13), which was why the CAT committee rejected the complaint (see decision RZ 8.2). However, in the judgment database HUDOC of the ECHR there is no judgment with the no. 33772/13, as the complaint was refused by the Registry and removed from the register - thus not examined by the ECtHR.\n\nIn the meantime, there are decisions from the committee in which he nevertheless examined such complaints.\n\n==General remarks==\n\nThe Committee publishes general comments on the interpretation and specification of the various provisions of the Torture Convention. They are intended to clear up misunderstandings and to assist the contracting states in the fulfillment of their contractual obligations. To date, the committee has written four General Comments (GC).\n* GC No. 1 (1997): Implementation of Art. 3 FoK (Refoulement Prohibition) in connection with Art. 22 FoK Individual complaints\n* GC No. 2 Implementation of Art. 2 FoK Prevention of Torture\n* GC No. 3 (2012) Implementation of Art. 14 FoK Reparation\n* GC No. 4 (2017) Implementation of Art. 3 FoK (refoulement prohibition) in connection with Art. 22 FoK Individual complaints\n\n==Members of the CAT==\nThe members appointed under Art. 17 FoK for 4 years each\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Mytilene is the [[capital city]] and port of the island of [[Lesbos]] and also the capital and administration center of the [[North Aegean]] Region. The seat of the governor of the [[North Aegean]] Region is Mytilene, such as the headquarters of the [[University of the Aegean]].\n\nMytilene is one of the 13 [[municipalities and communities of Greece|municipalities]] (counties) on the island of [[Lesbos]]. Mytilene is built on the southeast edge of the island.

The early harbors of Mytilene were linked during ancient times by a channel 700 meters long and 30 meters wide. The Roman writer Longus speaks of white stone bridges linking the two sides. The Greek word \u03b5\u1f54\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ''e\u00faripos'' is a commonly-used term when referring to a strait. The strait allowed ancient warships called [[trireme]]s, with three tiers of rowers or more. The boats that passed were ca. six meters wide plus oars and had depth of two meters.\n\nThe areas of the city that were densely populated connected the two bodies of land with marble bridges. They usually followed a curved line. The strait begins at the old market called Apano Skala. It was also close to Metropolis Street and ended at the Southern Harbor. One could argue that the channel transversed what is now called Ermou Street. Over time the strait began to collect silt and earth. There was also human intervention for the protection of the [[Castle of Mytilene]]. The strait eventually filled with earth.<ref>[http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 Harbor of Mytilene] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052712/http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 |date=2014-08-08 }} accessed July 31, 2014</ref>\n\nMytilene contested successfully with [[Mithymna]] in the north of the island for the leadership of the island in the seventh century BC and became the centre of the island's prosperous eastern hinterland.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Her most famous citizens were the poets [[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and the statesman [[Pittacus of Mitylene|Pittacus]] (one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]).

Significant excavations, however, do not seem to have started until after the First World War when in the mid-1920s Evangelides uncovered much of the famous theatre (according to Plutarch it was the inspiration for Pompey's theatre in Rome in 55 BC, the first permanent stone theatre in Rome) on the hill on the western side of town. Subsequent work in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s by various members of the Archaeological Service revealed more of the theatre, including a Roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena.  Salvage excavations carried out by the Archaeological Service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the Early Bronze Age although most have been much later (Hellenistic and Roman).  Particularly significant is a large stoa over a hundred metres long recently dug on the North Harbour of the city.  It is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that Mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] had written.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nArchaeological excavations carried out between 1984 and 1994 in the [[Castle of Mytilene]] by the [[University of British Columbia]] and directed by Caroline and Hector Williams revealed a previously unknown sanctuary of [[Demeter]] and [[Kore (sculpture)|Kore]] of late classical/Hellenistic date and the burial chapel of the [[Gattelusi]], the medieval [[Genoa|Genoese]] family that ruled the northern Aegean from the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries of our era. The Demeter sanctuary included five altars for sacrifices to Demeter and Kore and later also to Cybele, the great mother goddess of Anatolia.  Among the discoveries were thousands of oil lamps, terracotta figurines, loom weights and other dedications to the goddesses. Numerous animal bones, especially of piglets, also appeared. The Chapel of St. John served as the church of the castle and as a burial place for the Gattelusi family and its dependents. Although conversion to a mosque after the Ottoman capture of the city in 1462 resulted in the destruction of many graves, some remained. The great earthquake of February 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished; the Ottomans built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century.\n\nOther excavations done jointly with the 20th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities near the North Harbour of the city uncovered a multiperiod site with remains extending from a late Ottoman cemetery (including a \"vampire\" burial, a middle aged man with {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} spikes through his neck, middle and ankles) to a substantial Roman building constructed around a colonnaded courtyard (probably a tavern/brothel in its final phase in the mid-4th century AD) to remains of [[Hellenistic]] structures and debris from different Hellenistic manufacturing processes (pottery, figurines, cloth making and dyeing, bronze and iron working) to archaic and classical levels with rich collections of [[Aeolic]] grey wares. A section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city. Considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large North Harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe city has two excellent archaeological museums, one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure.  The former contains the rich Bronze Age remains from Thermi, a site north of Mytilene dug by the British in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions, architectural pieces, and coins.  The latter museum is especially rich in [[mosaic]]s and [[sculpture]], including the famous late [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic floor from the \"House of Menander\" with scenes from plays by that Athenian 4th-century BC playwright.  There are also mosaics and finds from other Roman mansions excavated by the [[Greek Archaeological Service]] under the direction of the archeologist Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|University of the Aegean}}\n[[File:Experimental Lyseum School of Mytilene.JPG|thumb|200px|Experimental Lyceum School of Mytilene]]\n\nThere are 15 primary schools in Mytilene, along with seven [[Secondary education|lyceums]], and eight [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} There are six university schools with 3671 undergraduates, the largest in the [[University of the Aegean]].

Mytilene is the [[capital city]] and port of the island of [[Lesbos]] and also the capital and administration center of the [[North Aegean]] Region. The seat of the governor of the [[North Aegean]] Region is Mytilene, such as the headquarters of the [[University of the Aegean]].\n\nMytilene is one of the 13 [[municipalities and communities of Greece|municipalities]] (counties) on the island of [[Lesbos]]. Mytilene is built on the southeast edge of the island. It is also the seat of a [[metropolitan bishop]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 59v 3.png|thumb|left|160px|[[Pittacus of Mytilene]] (c. 640 \u2013 568 BC), one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]; woodcut from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]].]]\n[[File:Port Mytilene.jpg|thumb|View of the port, with the dome of Saint Therapon.]]\n[[File:Lesbos Mytilene01.JPG|thumb|The church of [[Saint Therapon (Mytilene)|Saint Therapon]] at the port]]\n\nAs an ancient city, lying off the east coast, Mytilene was initially confined to a small island just offshore that later was joined to Lesbos, creating a north and south harbor. The early harbors of Mytilene were linked during ancient times by a channel 700 meters long and 30 meters wide. The Roman writer Longus speaks of white stone bridges linking the two sides. The Greek word \u03b5\u1f54\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ''e\u00faripos'' is a commonly-used term when referring to a strait. The strait allowed ancient warships called [[trireme]]s, with three tiers of rowers or more. The boats that passed were ca. six meters wide plus oars and had depth of two meters.\n\nThe areas of the city that were densely populated connected the two bodies of land with marble bridges. They usually followed a curved line. The strait begins at the old market called Apano Skala. It was also close to Metropolis Street and ended at the Southern Harbor. One could argue that the channel transversed what is now called Ermou Street. Over time the strait began to collect silt and earth. There was also human intervention for the protection of the [[Castle of Mytilene]]. The strait eventually filled with earth.<ref>[http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 Harbor of Mytilene] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052712/http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 |date=2014-08-08 }} accessed July 31, 2014</ref>\n\nMytilene contested successfully with [[Mithymna]] in the north of the island for the leadership of the island in the seventh century BC and became the centre of the island's prosperous eastern hinterland.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Her most famous citizens were the poets [[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and the statesman [[Pittacus of Mitylene|Pittacus]] (one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]).

Significant excavations, however, do not seem to have started until after the First World War when in the mid-1920s Evangelides uncovered much of the famous theatre (according to Plutarch it was the inspiration for Pompey's theatre in Rome in 55 BC, the first permanent stone theatre in Rome) on the hill on the western side of town. Subsequent work in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s by various members of the Archaeological Service revealed more of the theatre, including a Roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena.  Salvage excavations carried out by the Archaeological Service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the Early Bronze Age although most have been much later (Hellenistic and Roman).  Particularly significant is a large stoa over a hundred metres long recently dug on the North Harbour of the city.  It is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that Mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] had written.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nArchaeological excavations carried out between 1984 and 1994 in the [[Castle of Mytilene]] by the [[University of British Columbia]] and directed by Caroline and Hector Williams revealed a previously unknown sanctuary of [[Demeter]] and [[Kore (sculpture)|Kore]] of late classical/Hellenistic date and the burial chapel of the [[Gattelusi]], the medieval [[Genoa|Genoese]] family that ruled the northern Aegean from the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries of our era. The Demeter sanctuary included five altars for sacrifices to Demeter and Kore and later also to Cybele, the great mother goddess of Anatolia.  Among the discoveries were thousands of oil lamps, terracotta figurines, loom weights and other dedications to the goddesses. Numerous animal bones, especially of piglets, also appeared. The Chapel of St. John served as the church of the castle and as a burial place for the Gattelusi family and its dependents. Although conversion to a mosque after the Ottoman capture of the city in 1462 resulted in the destruction of many graves, some remained. The great earthquake of February 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished; the Ottomans built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century.\n\nOther excavations done jointly with the 20th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities near the North Harbour of the city uncovered a multiperiod site with remains extending from a late Ottoman cemetery (including a \"vampire\" burial, a middle aged man with {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} spikes through his neck, middle and ankles) to a substantial Roman building constructed around a colonnaded courtyard (probably a tavern/brothel in its final phase in the mid-4th century AD) to remains of [[Hellenistic]] structures and debris from different Hellenistic manufacturing processes (pottery, figurines, cloth making and dyeing, bronze and iron working) to archaic and classical levels with rich collections of [[Aeolic]] grey wares. A section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city. Considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large North Harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe city has two excellent archaeological museums, one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure.  The former contains the rich Bronze Age remains from Thermi, a site north of Mytilene dug by the British in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions, architectural pieces, and coins.  The latter museum is especially rich in [[mosaic]]s and [[sculpture]], including the famous late [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic floor from the \"House of Menander\" with scenes from plays by that Athenian 4th-century BC playwright.  There are also mosaics and finds from other Roman mansions excavated by the [[Greek Archaeological Service]] under the direction of the archeologist Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|University of the Aegean}}\n[[File:Experimental Lyseum School of Mytilene.JPG|thumb|200px|Experimental Lyceum School of Mytilene]]\n\nThere are 15 primary schools in Mytilene, along with seven [[Secondary education|lyceums]], and eight [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} There are six university schools with 3671 undergraduates, the largest in the [[University of the Aegean]].

He married [[List of Fringe characters#Elizabeth Bishop|Elizabeth Bishop]] in an undisclosed year, and their son, [[Peter Bishop (Fringe)|Peter Bishop]] was born in 1978.\n\nWalter and his friend William Bell conducted numerous experiments in the area of [[fringe science]], including developing highly advanced weapons for the Army. At some point during the 1970s, Walter and Bell discovered the existence of another universe, through the heightened use of [[LSD]], among other drugs.  They constructed a \"trans-dimensional window\", a portal which could view the other universe, which was more technologically advanced than our own (in \"[[Peter (Fringe episode)|Peter]]\", the Other Side appears to have already created digital cell phones by the year 1985).  They began copying the advanced technologies they saw over there, and sold them to the Army to benefit this world.  They spent much time sending objects over to the Other Side, including Bell's car, and discovered that the \"multiverse\" requires balance.  If a car goes over the Other Side, then a car of the same mass must be sent into our universe.\n\nIn 1985, the now seven-year-old Peter contracted a rare and savage disease.  Walter attempted numerous methods to cure him, ranging from trying to build a time machine to bring a researcher who specialized in these cases from the 1930s to the present, to watching his alternate self, dubbed \"Walternate\", work with advanced medicine to cure his own Peter in the alternate universe, who was also ill.  But Walter could not save his son, and he died in his arms. Following the funeral, which Bell never attended, Walter became consumed with watching Walternate work to save the other Peter.  Through the trans-dimensional window, Walter discovered that Walternate had formulated the correct cure for his son, but did not notice as he was distracted by The Observer known as [[List of Fringe characters#September|September]].  Knowing that Walternate would not be able to cure the other Peter, Walter created the correct compound and built a doorway into the other universe, with the intentions of curing Peter there, and then to return home.<ref name=episodepeter>{{cite episode |title=Peter|episodelink=Peter (Fringe episode) |series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[David Straiton]] (director), [[Akiva Goldsman]] (story), [[J.

In the ensuing struggle, Walter managed to get through the wormhole, but Nina's arm was caught in-between both universes, and she needed to have a cybernetic arm put in its place.  On the journey to the Other Side, the vial holding the cure was destroyed, forcing Walter to kidnap Peter, cure him back in our universe, and then return him.  On the way back, they fell through an icy lake, but were rescued by September, who warned Walter that Peter could never return to the alternate universe.  After he cured Peter, he and Elizabeth could not find themselves able to send Peter back, so they decided to raise him as their own.<ref name=episodepeter/>\n\nIn 1991, Walter's lab assistant, Dr. Carla Warren, was killed in a fire, and Walter was charged with manslaughter, but was deemed mentally unfit to be tried, so he was locked away inside the St. Claire's Mental Institution. Walter would spend 17 years inside St. Claire's, and was never visited by Peter.  Bell, under the alias of Dr. Simon Paris, performed several brain surgeries on Walter, extracting pieces of Walter's brain tissue, which contained the memories of how he crossed universes, per the request of Walter himself, who was frightened of what he was becoming.  With the pieces of his brain gone, Walter's intellect was diminished, and he was driven insane.<ref name=episodegreymatters>{{cite episode |title=Grey Matters|episodelink=Grey Matters (Fringe)|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Jeannot Szwarc]] (director), [[Ashley Edward Miller]] (writer), [[Zack Stentz]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=2009-12-10 |season=2 |number=10}}</ref>\n\nIn the beginning of the first season, [[Olivia Dunham]] blackmailed the adult Peter Bishop to release his father from St. Claire's, in hopes of curing her lover, [[List of Fringe characters#John Scott|John Scott]].  Peter became Walter's legal guardian.  After they saved John (who was thought to be a traitor, but later revealed to be an undercover NSA agent), Olivia requested that Walter and Peter remain in Boston, to which Peter reluctantly agreed.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Pilot|episodelink=Pilot (Fringe)|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Alex Graves]] (director), [[J.J.

Peter became fed up with his father and decided to leave Boston, but was kidnapped by a man who wanted the cylinder for himself.  September encountered Peter, and appeared to read his mind, making Peter realize \"The Pattern\" was far more than just plain coincidence.  He also began to see that Walter was not as insane as he originally thought, and a father-son relationship started to blossom.  And, Walter and Peter became civilian consultants to the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]], under the supervision of [[List of Fringe characters#Phillip Broyles|Phillip Broyles]].<ref name=\"The Arrival\"/>\n\nDuring the episode, \"[[Safe (Fringe)|Safe]]\", [[List of Fringe characters#Mitchell Loeb|Mitchell Loeb]] and a team of bank robbers used a vibrational dematerializing device to steal components from safety deposit boxes around the country.  The science team realized the safe belonged to Walter, and the components were all pieces of the machine he constructed in 1985 as his original plan to save Peter, but was eventually scrapped, which could \"bring anybody from any time or anywhere\".

Walter discovered that the ZFT manifesto was written in his very lab, by William Bell, years ago, after they discovered the alternate universe.  In episode 1x20, \"[[There's More Than One of Everything]]\", Walter reveals the existence of the Other Side to Peter, without telling him he was in fact from there.  Walter and Peter helped Olivia and Fringe Division stop Jones from crossing over to the Other Side to kill William Bell, and carried on with their lives, now happy as father-and-son.<ref>{{cite episode |title=There's More Than One of Everything|episodelink=There's More Than One of Everything|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Anderson (director)|Brad Anderson]] (director), [[Jeff Pinkner]] (writer), [[J.

Olivia was among the children who were treated with it, and was able to see into the Other Side because of it.  But, this left her emotionally scarred, and she is always defensive when it is brought up.\n\nIn the season two premiere, \"[[A New Day in the Old Town]]\", Walter and Peter learned that Olivia had returned to our side after visiting William Bell in the other universe, but, her return voyage left her gravely wounded and comatose.  Walter seemed to be greatly affected by this, as he had begun to look to Olivia like his own daughter.  Thankfully, she regained consciousness, and Walter learned that the person who tried to kill her was a shape-shifting assassin from the Other Side.<ref>{{cite episode |title=A New Day in the Old Town|episodelink=A New Day in the Old Town|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Joe Chappelle]] (director), [[Zack Stentz]] (writer), [[Ashley Edward Miller]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=2009-09-17 |season=2 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nBy now, Fringe Division is aware of the alternate universe, and just as the ZFT manifesto predicted, they had intentions to destroy us.  In the episode \"[[August (Fringe episode)|August]]\", an Observer called [[List of Fringe characters#August|August]] contacted Walter to help correct a mistake, which Walter initially believed was to send Peter back to the alternate universe, but, it was in fact a method on how to \"cheat death\", which he had achieved before.<ref>{{cite episode |title=August|episodelink=August (Fringe episode)|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Dennis Smith (director)|Dennis Smith]] (director), [[J.

Walter, temporarily sane, was forced to reveal to Newton how he crossed over to the other universe, and nearly died because of it, driving Peter to great lengths to save him.<ref name=episodegreymatters/> In the episode \"[[Jacksonville (Fringe)|Jacksonville]]\", Walter reactivated Olivia's Cortexiphan abilities, and she was able to identify objects from the other universe because of their distinctive \"glimmer\".  When she looked at Peter, she saw that he projected the same glimmer, making her realize he is from the Other Side.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Jacksonville|episodelink=Jacksonville (Fringe)|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Charles Beeson (director)|Charles Beeson]] (director), [[Zack Stentz]] (writer), [[Ashley Edward Miller]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=2010-02-04|season=2 |number=15}}</ref>  But, she eventually promises Walter that she would not tell Peter the truth, though Walter decides he must do it himself.\n\nIn the episode \"[[White Tulip]]\" Walter is seen writing a letter to Peter revealing to him that he was from the alternate universe. He is unable to bring himself to give the letter to Peter for the fear of losing him again is too great. The team are chasing down a man trying to rewind time to save his fianc\u00e9 from a fatal car crash. Each time the team comes close to catching him he \"resets\" time once again. Sent to negotiate with the time traveler, Walter tells him of his actions to save Peter and urges the man not to make the same mistake of changing the natural course of events, saying that he had \"traveled through madness\" to realize that some things must not be changed. Walter reveals that he has asked God to send him a sign of forgiveness in the form of a white tulip, a flower that did not bloom in that time of year. Heeding Walter's words, the man resets back to the day of his fianc\u00e9's death and holds her as a truck hits their car, killing them both. It is later revealed that during his last time 'reset', the time traveler leaves a letter for Walter with a colleague, to be delivered on the original day of the case. When Walter opens the delivered letter, he finds a tulip drawn on a white piece of paper: his so desperately sought after \"[[White Tulip]].\"<ref>{{cite episode |title=White Tulip|episodelink=White Tulip|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Thomas Yatsko]] (director), [[J.

He is injured and while in the hospital, confronts Walter (\"You said the effects of Newton's vibrations would be devastating. And they were, they... destroyed that FBI agent... they just... disintegrated him like he wasn't even there. But they didn't kill the man from the other side... and they didn't kill me. I'm not from here, am I?\") and angrily blames Walter for his mother (of our universe) committing suicide (\"That's why my  mother committed suicide, isn't it? She knew. Didn't she? And when I left, the guilt was too much for her to live with... the lie.\").

Informed by the Observers that Peter is in danger, Walter and Olivia cross to the alternate universe to recover him, with Walter sustaining a gunshot wound in the process. On their return to our universe, Peter tells Walter that he still hasn't forgiven Walter for taking him from his family as a child, saying, \"I've been trying to see this your way Walter... and I can't. But you did cross universes twice to save my life.

Unbeknownst to either of them, the Olivia Dunham they returned to our universe with was in fact her doppelganger, \"Fauxlivia\", while the prime-Olivia was held captive in the other universe.  Fauxlivia was under orders from Walternate to locate the pieces of the doomsday machine constructed by \"The First People\".

When Bell takes over the body of Olivia Dunham, he gets a chance to work with Walter again therefore giving him some closure.  Walter and Peter go into Olivia's mind to rescue her and move Bell's soul into a computer, but the plan doesn't work.\nAfter Walternate activates the machine on the other side, Peter has to get in it on this side, but Walter isn't willing to let him go. Eventually, he talks to Peter and lets him go in the machine, but Peter is thrown out and is badly injured. Walter goes to a church and talks to God, asking Him to save his universe even though he knows he has done bad things.  Once Peter gets back into the machine, his consciousness flashes forward to the year 2026. There Walter has been put in prison for destroying the other universe, but Peter is able to get him out to help him on a case. Walter realizes that the First People are indeed them and that they have to send the machine back in time through a wormhole that was created by the universes destruction. Back in present day, Peter uses the machine to create a bridge between the two universes, but then he is erased from the timeline and Walter is there to witness it.\nIn this readjusted timeline, Walter still took Peter from the other side, but once they crossed back over Peter drowned in Reiden Lake and died because the Observer didn't save him. Instead of Walter being checked out of St. Claire's by Peter, he was checked out by Olivia. He didn't live with Peter in a house, but instead lived in his lab and he hardly ever went outside of it due to tremendous fear. Without the constant of Peter being there, Walter was fragile and not whole.\nWalter began to have visions of Peter and he believed himself to be going crazy until Olivia said that she was also seeing him in dreams. Eventually, Peter showed up in Reiden Lake after Olivia saw apparitions of him. Walter didn't trust Peter and especially didn't believe him to be his son. At first refusing to work with Peter at all, Walter slowly came to accept him and try to help him return home. As the two spent more time with each other, Walter began to regard Peter with a warm affection, treating him like the son he never had the opportunity to get to know.\nIn the season four finale, after Walter is warned by September of the upcoming invasion of the Observers they working together to create a plan to defeat them The plan was rearranged in Walter's brain to protect him from being read by Observers. Meanwhile, Walter created a series of videotapes leaving detailed directions to obtain all of the pieces of his plan should something happen to him. Before the invasion, William Bell and Walter reconnected. Bell claimed he wanted to help Walter defeat the Observers. However, William betrayed Fringe Division and led the Observers to them. Walter ambered his Harvard Lab and all of the videotapes. He also ambered Astrid, Peter, William, and himself, at an unknown location in New York City to prevent the Observers from reaching them.  In 2036, Walter was discovered in amber by an associate of Henrietta Bishop, his granddaughter. Etta and Simon Foster went to the former Massive Dynamic building to locate pieces of Walter's brain. Restoring Walter to a new form of sanity, the team was ready to begin constructing the plan Walter had designed decades prior to defeat the Observers. Walter also led him to the place where he had been ambered and removed Astrid and Peter. Walter, knowing he would need Bell's handprint to access the beacons located in Bell's storage facility, cut off his hand before heading off to find Olivia.  The reunited team began to seek out Olivia, who had been ambered while retrieving a vital component of Walter's plan, the Transilience Thought Unifier that could make sense of the pieces inside his brain. However, by the time Olivia was rescued, Walter had been kidnapped by the Observers. He was tortured by Windmark, who was trying to discover what Walter's plan was to bring down the Observers. The torture took such a toll on Walter that even after he was rescued, he could not get the device to unify his thoughts. Henrietta believed that his ability to recall the information was destroyed and irrecoverable. Walter discovered the videotapes once the team returned to Harvard and began the lengthy process of removing them from amber. Each tape led the team to a different piece of the puzzle. he lengthy process of removing them from amber. Each tape led the team to a different piece of the puzzle.\nThe pieces of the brain that had been recently implanted back into Walter were the cause of his concern. He had the pieces removed because of the hubris man he was becoming decades before. He feared that he was slowly returning into that man once again. He requested that Nina help him remove the pieces from his brain once the plan was complete.\nThe team recovered Michael, a crucial part of the plan. He touched Walter's face in the lab as he tried to read his thoughts via machine to uncover his true significance to the plan. Instead, however, Michael showed Walter images from the Original Timeline. The memories came flooding back and Walter recovered all of his Original Timeline memories. He explained to Peter that he loved him even more now, although he had originally not thought this to be possible. After finding September (now calling himself Donald and turned into a regular human by the Observes as a punishment) they were able to gain a better understanding of the history of the plan: to travel in time to the year 2167 with Michael and prevented scientists from creating the emotionless Observers\nThe final step of the plan, which would send Michael forward in time, required Walter. Michael would be incapable of communicating with the scientists, so he needed an escort  who will be forced to live out their lives there as to ensure that a paradox is not created and that the Observers are wiped out. However, in order to safely travel through time, an inoculation was required. Walter was inoculated in 2015, believing it would redeem him for his hubris and breaking the universe many years before. He also left one inoculation in amber with the tapes in case something were to happen to him. September took the last inoculation in 2036 and explained to Walter that he wanted to take him himself, having come to have feelings for Michael.\nHowever, moments after the portal was opened, September was gunned down by Loyalists. Walter realized that it had always been his destiny and that he must sacrifice in order to save the world decides to take Michael through the wormhole as Peter, Olivia, and Astrid look on. Before entering the wormhole, Walter looks back at Peter and Peter mouths \"I love you, Dad\" to Walter.\nTime flashes back to 2015, where Peter, Olivia, and their young daughter Etta are enjoying a day in the park. The Observer invasion does not occur, and the family returns home. When Peter checks the mail, he finds an envelope addressed to him from W. Bishop, containing only a piece of paper with a drawn white tulip on it.\n\n===Religion===\nIn the first season Walter describes [[God]] as the only other individual who had access to all his research. In the second season Walter describes himself as a former atheist who realized he had committed a grievous crime against God when he stole Walternate's son and is now actively seeking [[Forgiveness#Christianity|forgiveness]] for his trespass. In the final episode of the third season Walter kneels before a [[Christian cross|cross]] and begs God to spare humanity from obliteration.\n\n===Walternate===\n{{anchor|Walternate}}\nWalter also exists in the show's [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]], though to distinguish between the prime and parallel versions of Walter, the show's characters as well as its producers, journalists, and fans, identify the parallel character as \"Walternate\", a portmanteau of \"Walter\" and \"alternate\". However, they have several key differences in personality: Walternate never suffers from the brain damage his counterpart does, and is thus completely in control of his mental facilities. He is also more ruthless and cruel than his counterpart, with a firm belief that the ends justify the means.\n\nWalternate in the parallel universe had a similar history to Walter through 1985, having married the same Elizabeth and having their own child Peter. There are variations in their history as well, in part due to the William Bell of the parallel universe dying in a car accident as a child and thus never befriending Walternate. Walternate was appointed as the United States \"national security czar\", and saw the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] to its success. Walternate is also shown to have started a company called \"Bishop Dynamic\" (a parallel to [[Massive Dynamic]], the company founded by William Bell in the prime universe).<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.avclub.com/articles/subject-13,52321/ |title =Subject 13 |date=  2011-02-25 |accessdate= 2011-04-06 |publisher= [[The A.V.

After receiving moral support from Elizabeth, he returned to work, and later is surprised when young Olivia appears to him when she crosses over from the prime universe. Receiving her sketchbook, Walternate discovers that Peter is in the prime universe and resolves to get him back.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Subject 13|episodelink=Subject 13|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Frederick E.

He is also good friends with the second-in command of the Fringe Division, Colonel [[Phillip Broyles]]. He identified means of stopping the singularities caused by Walter's crossing in 1985 by using an amber-like substance to seal the area around these, regardless of the innocent lives trapped. He has also engineered the shapeshifters to cross to the prime universe and perform actions that ultimately allow him to cross over and convince Peter to return to the parallel universe. He shows Peter the [[doomsday device]] that they have found and reconstructed, and urges Peter to figure out how it works as the device only reacts to his biological signature. The purpose of the machine is later revealed during a scene at a pub; the observer strolls by, leaving behind a drawing depicting Peter being responsible for the apocalypse through the doomsday device.\n\nWhen the prime universe Olivia and Walter arrive to rescue Peter, Walternate arranges for Olivia's doppelganger, Fauxlivia, to pretend she is Olivia and return with Walter and Peter. Having captured the original Olivia, Walternate subjects her to memory implantation to make her believe she is Fauxlivia while trying to recreate the Cortexiphan drug and understand its properties, intending to execute her once his goals are reached. Meanwhile, Walternate has engaged Fauxlivia to help the prime universe discover the same doomsday machine, eventually recovering one part that was missing in his construction. When it comes time for Fauxlivia to be extracted from the prime-universe, Walternate arranges for Olivia to be executed and her brain removed, with her body being used for the exchange of mass needed for Fauxlivia to return. However, a sympathetic Colonel Broyles helps Olivia escape, and is killed by Walternate's mercenaries in the effort, causing Walternate to use his friend's body for the mass-exchange, but has it mutilated first so that it would have the same mass as Fauxlivia.\n\nWhen Fauxlivia returns and finds out she is pregnant with Peter's child and Walternate's grandchild, Walternate 'offers' to help in any way he can, believing the child will be an alternative way of activating the doomsday device through acquiring Peter's genes, going as far as to organize an anonymous kidnapping of Fauxlivia and accelerating her pregnancy to ensure the baby's survival. By now it is revealed that the vengeful, relentless Walternate's only previous interest in Peter was his unique biological blueprint needed to activate the machine. Believing that now that Peter has chosen his side, he doesn't hesitate to proceed to activate the machine with the intent of destroying the prime universe and his son along with it.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Immortality|episodelink=Immortality (Fringe)|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Anderson (director)|Brad Anderson]] (director) [[David Wilcox (screenwriter)|David Wilcox]] (writer), [[Ethan Gross]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate= 2011-02-11|season=3 |number=13}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the machine does not work as expected: while it accelerates the deterioration of the prime-universe, it does not begin to heal the alternate one. After Peter activates the prime-universe version of the machine in an attempt to combat the decay, Walternate discovers he cannot shut down his version of it, and attempts to have Fauxlivia do it, believing that she might be able to access the same telekinetic powers as her counterpart. However, Peter uses the prime-universe machine to create a \"bridge\" between both worlds, so that both can work together to heal their prospective universes, an alliance which Walternate grudgingly agrees to.\n\nWalternate's middle name is shown as Harold on a certificate in his office on Liberty Island.\n\n==Development==\nAustralian actor [[John Noble]] was cast in January 2008 as \"an institutionalized scientist whose work might be at the center of the coming storm\".<ref name=reuterscasting>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/01/24/television-noble-dc-idUSN2417799520080124 |title=Fox draws Noble, Reddick into its \"Fringe\" |work=[[Reuters]] |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |date=2008-01-24 |accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref> At the time, he was a relatively unknown actor best known to audiences as [[Denethor]] in the 2003 film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.<ref name=reuterscasting/> Noble became aware of the ''Fringe'' casting call from his daughter, actress [[Samantha Noble]].

Once a brilliant scientist in the realm of fringe science, his trials in life have left him with gaps in his memory and with traits that can best be described as child like. While many parts of his intellect remain intact, he suffers from some degree of agoraphobia and has difficulty properly looking after himself, such that in both timelines he requires either Peter or Astrid to provide him with a basic level of care and supervision. He has a great penchant for culinary arts, and can be found cooking and eating at odd times, for example, both in his lab while performing autopsies, and while naked in Peter's kitchen. Red licorice seems to be among his most favorite of foods, though he also has a penchant for custard, root beer floats, and pastries. In line with his child like demeanor, Walter Bishop has a lovable innocence about him which is occasionally interrupted by tantrum like outbursts over largely trivial things. One such outburst occurred in the supermarket when he discovered the use of brominated food additives in pop tarts, when he was shopping for pudding, and another occurred in a hotel room, in which he found the thought of being surrounded by germs too great to handle. His personality contrasts sharply with that of his parallel universe counterpart, \"Walternate\"; the Secretary of Defense, who is cool, collected, serious, and has a clandestine way about him which gives others the impression that he is untrustworthy.\n\nWhile some of these differences are likely attributed to the fact that Walternate was never institutionalized nor had parts of his brain removed, there is evidence to suggest that the personalities of the two Walters began to diverge long before the death of Peter Bishop the boy, from the primary universe. In the primary universe, Walter chose to come home the night his son would die, and it was Walter who showed his son how to do the coin trick. In the parallel universe, Walternate chose to remain at his lab, and it was his wife who showed their son the coin trick. Additionally, when Walter crossed over and kidnapped Walternate's Peter by impersonating him, the boy picked up on the subtle differences between the two and accused Walter of not being his real father. Apparently, Walternate does not wear brown jackets. The progenitor of this divergence might have inadvertently been William Bell. Walter and William Bell met as children and experimented liberally with drugs such as LSD in their youth, while Walternate never had the opportunity to meet the William Bell of his universe.\n\nNevertheless, we can occasionally see flickers of Walternate's cold demeanor in Walter, for example, when Walter sedated Astrid without her permission, by jamming a needle into the back of her neck, so that he could sneak away from the lab, and in the future when he coldly responds to a compliment with an insult. Though the latter situation occurred after cells from the removed portions of his brain were used to repair brain damage he had sustained.\n\nOther similarities shared by the two Walters include a tendency to engage in what most would call scientifically unethical behavior, and a stubborn hatred of one another.\n\n===Relationships===\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = \"That's become the glue that sticks the show together, and I think J.J. Abrams always had that in mind. But Joshua Jackson and I just picked it up and ran with it. It seemed like a beautiful opportunity to create something special. It's resonated so much with our audience. People stop Joshua in the street and tell him to treat his father better. I had a driver the other day who told me that he totally relates to Walter as a father and going through difficult times with his son.

Elizabeth committed suicide while Walter was in the mental institution. Walter and Peter have since gradually grown closer, though the relationship suffered upon Peter learning he was taken from the parallel universe as a boy.\n\nWalter has remained fond of Olivia, and it was later revealed that she was one of his test subjects for his [[nootropic]] drug, Cortexiphan. Their relationship suffered when Olivia learned about this connection. Walter also is close with his lab assistant Astrid Farnsworth.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nMaureen Ryan of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called Noble the series' \"secret weapon\" for his ability to \"move with lightning speed between surreal goofiness and touching insecurity, often within a single scene.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/fringe/ |title =The 'Fringe' episode you don't want to miss |date=  2010-03-31 |accessdate= 2011-06-30 |work= [[Chicago Tribune]] |first = Maureen |last = Ryan }}</ref> ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine named Noble as the 23rd best performance of 2010, calling him \"excellent right out of the gate\" and Walter as the \"show's best character\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2010/12/the-25-best-tv-performances-of-2010.html |title =The 25 Best TV Performances of 2010 |date=  2010-06-07 |accessdate= 2011-04-06 |work= [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |first = Tim |last = Basham}}</ref> ''[[TV Squad]]'' named Walter one of 2010's best television characters.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/12/29/the-10-greatest-tv-characters-of-2010/ |title =The 10 Greatest TV Characters of 2010 |date=  2010-12-29 |accessdate= 2011-04-06 |work= [[TV Squad]] |first = Bob |last = Sassone}}</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Walter Bishop one of the best characters of 2008, noting, \"the role of the modern-day mad scientist could so easily have been a disaster, but the 'Fringe' writers and the masterful John Noble have conspired to create a character that seems, as trite as it sounds, more Shakespearean than sci-fi.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-laca..templatelibrary.a.ar3-2008dec21,0,2123740.story|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130052603/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-laca..templatelibrary.a.ar3-2008dec21,0,2123740.story|title=Grateful for 'Life,' 'In Treatment,' 'Dexter' ...|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 21, 2008|accessdate=May 22, 2011|archivedate=January 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{See also|List of awards and nominations received by Fringe}}\n\nFor the second season, Noble submitted his work for consideration in the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] category at the [[62nd Primetime Emmy Awards]].

He married [[List of Fringe characters#Elizabeth Bishop|Elizabeth Bishop]] in an undisclosed year, and their son, [[Peter Bishop (Fringe)|Peter Bishop]] was born in 1978.\n\nWalter and his friend William Bell conducted numerous experiments in the area of [[fringe science]], including developing highly advanced weapons for the Army. At some point during the 1970s, Walter and Bell discovered the existence of another universe, through the heightened use of [[LSD]], among other drugs.  They constructed a \"trans-dimensional window\", a portal which could view the other universe, which was more technologically advanced than our own (in \"[[Peter (Fringe episode)|Peter]]\", the Other Side appears to have already created digital cell phones by the year 1985).  They began copying the advanced technologies they saw over there, and sold them to the Army to benefit this world.  They spent much time sending objects over to the Other Side, including Bell's car, and discovered that the \"multiverse\" requires balance.  If a car goes over the Other Side, then a car of the same mass must be sent into our universe.\n\nIn 1985, the now seven-year-old Peter contracted a rare and savage disease.  Walter attempted numerous methods to cure him, ranging from trying to build a time machine to bring a researcher who specialized in these cases from the 1930s to the present, to watching his alternate self, dubbed \"Walternate\", work with advanced medicine to cure his own Peter in the alternate universe, who was also ill.  But Walter could not save his son, and he died in his arms. Following the funeral, which Bell never attended, Walter became consumed with watching Walternate work to save the other Peter.  Through the trans-dimensional window, Walter discovered that Walternate had formulated the correct cure for his son, but did not notice as he was distracted by The Observer known as [[List of Fringe characters#September|September]].  Knowing that Walternate would not be able to cure the other Peter, Walter created the correct compound and built a doorway into the other universe, with the intentions of curing Peter there, and then to return home.<ref name=episodepeter>{{cite episode |title=Peter|episodelink=Peter (Fringe episode) |series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[David Straiton]] (director), [[Akiva Goldsman]] (story), [[J.

On the journey to the Other Side, the vial holding the cure was destroyed, forcing Walter to kidnap Peter, cure him back in our universe, and then return him.  On the way back, they fell through an icy lake, but were rescued by September, who warned Walter that Peter could never return to the alternate universe.

In episode 1x20, \"[[There's More Than One of Everything]]\", Walter reveals the existence of the Other Side to Peter, without telling him he was in fact from there.

Olivia was among the children who were treated with it, and was able to see into the Other Side because of it.  But, this left her emotionally scarred, and she is always defensive when it is brought up.\n\nIn the season two premiere, \"[[A New Day in the Old Town]]\", Walter and Peter learned that Olivia had returned to our side after visiting William Bell in the other universe, but, her return voyage left her gravely wounded and comatose.  Walter seemed to be greatly affected by this, as he had begun to look to Olivia like his own daughter.

The team are chasing down a man trying to rewind time to save his fiance from a fatal car crash. Each time the team comes close to catching him he \"resets\" time once again. Sent to negotiate with the time traveler, Walter tells him of his actions to save Peter and urges the man not to make the same mistake of changing the natural course of events, saying that he had \"traveled through madness\" to realize that some things must not be changed. Walter reveals that he has asked God to send him a sign of forgiveness in the form of a white tulip, a flower that did not bloom in that time of year. Heeding Walter's words, the man resets back to the day of his fiance's death and holds her as a truck hits their car, killing them both. It is later revealed that during his last time 'reset', the time traveler leaves a letter for Walter with a colleague, to be delivered on the original day of the case.

When Bell takes over the body of Olivia Dunham, he gets a chance to work with Walter again therefore giving him some closure.  Walter and Peter go into Olivia's mind to rescue her and move Bell's soul into a computer, but the plan doesn't work.\nAfter Walternate activates the machine on the other side, Peter has to get in it on this side, but Walter isn't willing to let him go. Eventually, he talks to Peter and lets him go in the machine, but Peter is thrown out and is badly injured. Walter goes to a church and talks to God, asking Him to save his universe even though he knows he has done bad things.  Once Peter gets back into the machine, his consciousness flashes forward to the year 2026. There Walter has been put in prison for destroying the other universe, but Peter is able to get him out to help him on a case. Walter realizes that the First People are indeed them and that they have to send the machine back in time through a wormhole that was created by the universes destruction. Back in present day, Peter uses the machine to create a bridge between the two universes, but then he is erased from the timeline and Walter is there to witness it.\nIn this readjusted timeline, Walter still took Peter from the other side, but once they crossed back over Peter drowned in Reiden Lake and died because the Observer didn't save him. Instead of Walter being checked out of St. Claire's by Peter, he was checked out by Olivia. He didn't live with Peter in a house, but instead lived in his lab and he hardly ever went outside of it due to tremendous fear. Without the constant of Peter being there, Walter was fragile and not whole.\nWalter began to have visions of Peter and he believed himself to be going crazy until Olivia said that she was also seeing him in dreams. Eventually, Peter showed up in Reiden Lake after Olivia saw apparitions of him. Walter didn't trust Peter and especially didn't believe him to be his son. At first refusing to work with Peter at all, Walter slowly came to accept him and try to help him return home. As the two spent more time with each other, Walter began to regard Peter with a warm affection, treating him like the son he never had the opportunity to get to know.\nIn the season four finale, after Walter is warned by September of the upcoming invasion of the Observers they working together to create a plan to defeat them The plan was rearranged in Walter's brain to protect him from being read by Observers. Meanwhile, Walter created a series of videotapes leaving detailed directions to obtain all of the pieces of his plan should something happen to him. Before the invasion, William Bell and Walter reconnected. Bell claimed he wanted to help Walter defeat the Observers. However, William betrayed Fringe Division and led the Observers to them. Walter ambered his Harvard Lab and all of the videotapes. He also ambered Astrid, Peter, William, and himself, at an unknown location in New York City to prevent the Observers from reaching them.  In 2036, Walter was discovered in amber by an associate of Henrietta Bishop, his granddaughter. Etta and Simon Foster went to the former Massive Dynamic building to locate pieces of Walter's brain. Restoring Walter to a new form of sanity, the team was ready to begin constructing the plan Walter had designed decades prior to defeat the Observers. Walter also led him to the place where he had been ambered and removed Astrid and Peter. Walter, knowing he would need Bell's handprint to access the beacons located in Bell's storage facility, cut off his hand before heading off to find Olivia.  The reunited team began to seek out Olivia, who had been ambered while retrieving a vital component of Walter's plan, the Transilience Thought Unifier that could make sense of the pieces inside his brain. However, by the time Olivia was rescued, Walter had been kidnapped by the Observers. He was tortured by Windmark, who was trying to discover what Walter's plan was to bring down the Observers. The torture took such a toll on Walter that even after he was rescued, he could not get the device to unify his thoughts. Henrietta believed that his ability to recall the information was destroyed and irrecoverable. Walter discovered the videotapes once the team returned to Harvard and began the lengthy process of removing them from amber. Each tape led the team to a different piece of the puzzle. he lengthy process of removing them from amber. Each tape led the team to a different piece of the puzzle.\nThe pieces of the brain that had been recently implanted back into Walter were the cause of his concern. He had the pieces removed because of the hubris man he was becoming decades before. He feared that he was slowly returning into that man once again. He requested that Nina help him remove the pieces from his brain once the plan was complete.\nThe team recovered Michael, a crucial part of the plan. He touched Walter's face in the lab as he tried to read his thoughts via machine to uncover his true significance to the plan. Instead, however, Michael showed Walter images from the Original Timeline. The memories came flooding back and Walter recovered all of his Original Timeline memories. He explained to Peter that he loved him even more now, although he had originally not thought this to be possible. After finding September (now calling himself Donald and turned into a regular human by the Observes as a punishment) they were able to gain a better understanding of the history of the plan: to travel in time to the year 2167 with Michael and prevented scientists from creating the emotionless Observers\nThe final step of the plan, which would send Michael forward in time, required Walter. Michael would be incapable of communicating with the scientists, so he needed an escort  who will be forced to live out their lives there as to ensure that a paradox is not created and that the Observers are wiped out. However, in order to safely travel through time, an inoculation was required. Walter was inoculated in 2015, believing it would redeem him for his hubris and breaking the universe many years before. He also left one inoculation in amber with the tapes in case something were to happen to him. September took the last inoculation in 2036 and explained to Walter that he wanted to take him himself, having come to have feelings for Michael.\nHowever, moments after the portal was opened, September was gunned down by Loyalists. Walter realized that it had always been his destiny and that he must sacrifice in order to save the world decides to take Michael through the wormhole as Peter, Olivia, and Astrid look on. Before entering the wormhole, Walter looks back at Peter and Peter mouths \"I love you, Dad\" to Walter.\nTime flashes back to 2015, where Peter, Olivia, and their young daughter Etta are enjoying a day in the park. The Observer invasion does not occur, and the family returns home. When Peter checks the mail, he finds an envelope addressed to him from W. Bishop, containing only a piece of paper with a drawn white tulip on it.\n\n===Religion===\nIn the first season Walter describes [[God]] as the only other individual who had access to all his research. In the second season Walter describes himself as a former atheist who realized he had committed a grievous crime against God when he stole Walternate's son and is now actively seeking [[Forgiveness#Christianity|forgiveness]] for his trespass. In the final episode of the third season Walter kneels before a [[Christian cross|cross]] and begs God to spare humanity from obliteration.\n\n===Walternate===\n{{anchor|Walternate}}\nWalter also exists in the show's [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]], though to distinguish between the prime and parallel versions of Walter, the show's characters as well as its producers, journalists, and fans, identify the parallel character as \"Walternate\", a portmanteau of \"Walter\" and \"alternate\". However, they have several key differences in personality: Walternate never suffers from the brain damage his counterpart does, and is thus completely in control of his mental facilities. He is also more ruthless and cruel than his counterpart, with a firm belief that the ends justify the means.\n\nWalternate in the parallel universe had a similar history to Walter through 1985, having married the same Elizabeth and having their own child Peter. There are variations in their history as well, in part due to the William Bell of the parallel universe dying in a car accident as a child and thus never befriending Walternate. Walternate was appointed as the United States \"national security czar\", and saw the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] to its success. Walternate is also shown to have started a company called \"Bishop Dynamic\" (a parallel to [[Massive Dynamic]], the company founded by William Bell in the prime universe).<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.avclub.com/articles/subject-13,52321/ |title =Subject 13 |date=  2011-02-25 |accessdate= 2011-04-06 |publisher= [[The A.V.

He is also good friends with the second-in command of the Fringe Division, Colonel [[Phillip Broyles]]. He identified means of stopping the singularities caused by Walter's crossing in 1985 by using an amber-like substance to seal the area around these, regardless of the innocent lives trapped. He has also engineered the shapeshifters to cross to the prime universe and perform actions that ultimately allow him to cross over and convince Peter to return to the parallel universe. He shows Peter the [[doomsday device]] that they have found and reconstructed, and urges Peter to figure out how it works as the device only reacts to his biological signature. The purpose of the machine is later revealed during a scene at a pub; the observer strolls by, leaving behind a drawing depicting Peter being responsible for the apocalypse through the doomsday device.\n\nWhen the prime universe Olivia and Walter arrive to rescue Peter, Walternate arranges for Olivia's doppelganger, Fauxlivia, to pretend she is Olivia and return with Walter and Peter. Having captured the original Olivia, Walternate subjects her to memory implantation to make her believe she is Fauxlivia while trying to recreate the Cortexiphan drug and understand its properties, intending to execute her once his goals are reached. Meanwhile, Walternate has engaged Fauxlivia to help the prime universe discover the same doomsday machine, eventually recovering one part that was missing in his construction. When it comes time for Fauxlivia to be extracted from the prime-universe, Walternate arranges for Olivia to be executed and her brain removed, with her body being used for the exchange of mass needed for Fauxlivia to return. However, a sympathetic Colonel Broyles helps Olivia escape, and is killed by Walternate's mercenaries in the effort, causing Walternate to use his friend's body for the mass-exchange, but has it mutilated first so that it would have the same mass as Fauxlivia.\n\nWhen Fauxlivia returns and finds out she is pregnant with Peter's child and Walternate's grandchild, Walternate 'offers' to help in any way he can, believing the child will be an alternative way of activating the doomsday device through acquiring Peter's genes, going as far as to organize an anonymous kidnapping of Fauxlivia and accelerating her pregnancy to ensure the baby's survival. By now it is revealed that the vengeful, relentless Walternate's only previous interest in Peter was his unique biological blueprint needed to activate the machine. Believing that now that Peter has chosen his side, he doesn't hesitate to proceed to activate the machine with the intent of destroying the prime universe and his son along with it.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Immortality|episodelink=Immortality (Fringe)|series=Fringe |serieslink=Fringe (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Anderson (director)|Brad Anderson]] (director) [[David Wilcox (screenwriter)|David Wilcox]] (writer), [[Ethan Gross]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate= 2011-02-11|season=3 |number=13}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the machine does not work as expected: while it accelerates the deterioration of the prime-universe, it does not begin to heal the alternate one. After Peter activates the prime-universe version of the machine in an attempt to combat the decay, Walternate discovers he cannot shut down his version of it, and attempts to have Fauxlivia do it, believing that she might be able to access the same telekinetic powers as her counterpart. However, Peter uses the prime-universe machine to create a \"bridge\" between both worlds, so that both can work together to heal their prospective universes, an alliance which Walternate grudgingly agrees to.\n\nWalternate's middle name is shown as Harold on a certificate in his office on Liberty Island.\n\n==Development==\nAustralian actor [[John Noble]] was cast in January 2008 as \"an institutionalized scientist whose work might be at the center of the coming storm\".<ref name=reuterscasting>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/01/24/television-noble-dc-idUSN2417799520080124 |title=Fox draws Noble, Reddick into its \"Fringe\" |work=[[Reuters]] |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |date=2008-01-24 |accessdate=2011-06-05}}</ref> At the time, he was a relatively unknown actor best known to audiences as [[Denethor]] in the 2003 film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.<ref name=reuterscasting/> Noble became aware of the ''Fringe'' casting call from his daughter, actress [[Samantha Noble]].

Once a brilliant scientist in the realm of fringe science, his trials in life have left him with gaps in his memory and with traits that can best be described as child like. While many parts of his intellect remain intact, he suffers from some degree of agoraphobia and has difficulty properly looking after himself, such that in both timelines he requires either Peter or Astrid to provide him with a basic level of care and supervision. He has a great penchant for culinary arts, and can be found cooking and eating at odd times, for example, both in his lab while performing autopsies, and while naked in Peter's kitchen. Red licorice seems to be among his most favorite of foods, though he also has a penchant for custard, root beer floats, and pastries. In line with his child like demeanor, Walter Bishop has a lovable innocence about him which is occasionally interrupted by tantrum like outbursts over largely trivial things. One such outburst occurred in the supermarket when he discovered the use of brominated food additives in pop tarts, when he was shopping for pudding, and another occurred in a hotel room, in which he found the thought of being surrounded by germs too great to handle. His personality contrasts sharply with that of his parallel universe counterpart, \"Walternate\"; the Secretary of Defense, who is cool, collected, serious, and has a clandestine way about him which gives others the impression that he is untrustworthy.\n\nWhile some of these differences are likely attributed to the fact that Walternate was never institutionalized nor had parts of his brain removed, there is evidence to suggest that the personalities of the two Walters began to diverge long before the death of Peter Bishop the boy, from the primary universe. In the primary universe, Walter chose to come home the night his son would die, and it was Walter who showed his son how to do the coin trick. In the parallel universe, Walternate chose to remain at his lab, and it was his wife who showed their son the coin trick. Additionally, when Walter crossed over and kidnapped Walternate's Peter by impersonating him, the boy picked up on the subtle differences between the two and accused Walter of not being his real father. Apparently, Walternate does not wear brown jackets. The progenitor of this divergence might have inadvertently been William Bell. Walter and William Bell met as children and experimented liberally with drugs such as LSD in their youth, while Walternate never had the opportunity to meet the William Bell of his universe.\n\nNevertheless, we can occasionally see flickers of Walternate's cold demeanor in Walter, for example, when Walter sedated Astrid without her permission, by jamming a needle into the back of her neck, so that he could sneak away from the lab, and in the future when he coldly responds to a compliment with an insult. Though the latter situation occurred after cells from the removed portions of his brain were used to repair brain damage he had sustained.\n\nOther similarities shared by the two Walters include a tendency to engage in what most would call scientifically unethical behavior, and a stubborn hatred of one another.\n\n===Relationships===\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = \"That's become the glue that sticks the show together, and I think J.J. Abrams always had that in mind. But Joshua Jackson and I just picked it up and ran with it. It seemed like a beautiful opportunity to create something special. It's resonated so much with our audience. People stop Joshua in the street and tell him to treat his father better. I had a driver the other day who told me that he totally relates to Walter as a father and going through difficult times with his son.

Elizabeth committed suicide while Walter was in the mental institution. Walter and Peter have since gradually grown closer, though the relationship suffered upon Peter learning he was taken from the parallel universe as a boy.\n\nWalter has remained fond of Olivia, and it was later revealed that she was one of his test subjects for his [[nootropic]] drug, Cortexiphan. Their relationship suffered when Olivia learned about this connection. Walter also is close with his lab assistant Astrid Farnsworth.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nMaureen Ryan of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called Noble the series' \"secret weapon\" for his ability to \"move with lightning speed between surreal goofiness and touching insecurity, often within a single scene.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/fringe/ |title =The 'Fringe' episode you don't want to miss |date=  2010-03-31 |accessdate= 2011-06-30 |work= [[Chicago Tribune]] |first = Maureen |last = Ryan }}</ref> ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine named Noble as the 23rd best performance of 2010, calling him \"excellent right out of the gate\" and Walter as the \"show's best character\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2010/12/the-25-best-tv-performances-of-2010.html |title =The 25 Best TV Performances of 2010 |date=  2010-06-07 |accessdate= 2011-04-06 |work= [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |first = Tim |last = Basham}}</ref> ''[[TV Squad]]'' named Walter one of 2010's best television characters.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/12/29/the-10-greatest-tv-characters-of-2010/ |title =The 10 Greatest TV Characters of 2010 |date=  2010-12-29 |accessdate= 2011-04-06 |work= [[TV Squad]] |first = Bob |last = Sassone}}</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Walter Bishop one of the best characters of 2008, noting, \"the role of the modern-day mad scientist could so easily have been a disaster, but the 'Fringe' writers and the masterful John Noble have conspired to create a character that seems, as trite as it sounds, more Shakespearean than sci-fi.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-laca..templatelibrary.a.ar3-2008dec21,0,2123740.story|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130052603/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-laca..templatelibrary.a.ar3-2008dec21,0,2123740.story|title=Grateful for 'Life,' 'In Treatment,' 'Dexter' ...|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 21, 2008|accessdate=May 22, 2011|archivedate=January 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{See also|List of awards and nominations received by Fringe}}\n\nFor the second season, Noble submitted his work for consideration in the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] category at the [[62nd Primetime Emmy Awards]].

Despite being bisexual in fantasy and activity, these men identify as \"gay\" or \"straight\" rather than as bisexual. This erasure of bisexuality is sometimes caused by denying the significance of an erotic encounter in order to maintain a person's [[sexual identity]] and sense of community; a man might downplay having had sexual fantasies or encounters with a woman in order to maintain his identity as a \"gay man\" and his membership in the gay community, or a man might downplay having had sexual fantasies or encounters with a man in order to maintain his status as a heterosexual man in [[heteronormative]] society.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=[[SpringerLink]] |doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-0737-2_14 |title = Denial|pages=219\u2013230 |year = 1989|last1 = Friedman|first1 = Richard C.|isbn=978-1-4612-8057-6 |chapter=Denial in the Development of Homosexual Men }}</ref>\n\nWriting for [[Bisexual.org]], author and columnist Zachary Zane cites a study showing that 20.7% of straight-identified men watched [[gay pornography]] and 7.5% reported having sex with a man in the past six months, while 55% of gay-identified men had watched heterosexual pornography and 0.7% reported having sex with a woman in the past six months. He argues that some of the straight-identified men are actually gay or bisexual but are erasing their bisexuality due to internalized biphobia and denial in order to claim a straight identity label. Pointing out that the majority of gay-identified men watched heterosexual pornography but few had recent heterosexual sex, he suggests that many self-identified gay men have sexual fantasies about women and in an ideal world would be openly bisexual and freely explore sex with women, but society pressures gay men to \"pick a side\" so those men \"subsequently have picked being gay\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zane|first1=Zachary|title=1 in 5 Straight-Identifying Men Watch Same-sex Porn: Are They All Closeted|url=https://bisexual.org/1-in-5-straight-identifying-men-watch-same-sex-porn-are-they-all-closeted/|website=Bisexual.org|publisher=The American Institute of Bisexuality|date=October 20, 2016|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nBisexual author and activist [[Robyn Ochs]] has argued that gay men are less possessive of their \"gay\" label than [[lesbians]] are of their label. She argues that there is less hostility to bisexual men who identify as gay than bisexual women who identify as lesbian, that there is a great deal of [[sexual fluidity]] between gay men and bisexual men, and that consequently more gay-identified men openly admit to being attracted to and having sex with women. However, Ochs also argues that many bisexual men identify as gay in order to politically align themselves with the gay community. She says that since coming out is so difficult for gay men, many do not want to come out a second time as bisexual; the existence of male bisexuality can be threatening to some gay men because it raises the possibility that they themselves might be bisexual.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://robynochs.com/biphobia-it-goes-more-than-two-ways/ |title=BIPHOBIA: IT GOES MORE THAN TWO WAYS |publisher=[[Robyn Ochs|robynochs.com]] |accessdate=2017-10-22|date=2015-03-11 }}</ref>\n\nGay male activist [[Carl Wittman]], writing in his \"Refugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifesto\", argued that gay men should identify as \"gay\" rather than as \"bisexual\", even if they sleep with women. Stating that gay men should only become bisexual once society accepts homosexuality, he wrote that:{{quote|Bisexuality is good; it is the capacity to love people of either sex. The reason so few of us are bisexual is because society made such a big stink about homosexuality that we got forced into seeing ourselves as either straight or non-straight. Also, many gays go turned off to the ways men are supposed to act with women and vice-versa, which is pretty f---ed-up. Gays will begin to turn on to women when 1) it's something that we do because we want to, and not because we should, and 2) when women's liberation changes the nature of heterosexual relationships. We continue to call ourselves homosexual, not bisexual, even if we do make it with the opposite sex also, because saying \"Oh, I'm Bi\" is a copout for a gay.

Jen\u00e9e Wilde presents the idea of what she calls \"dimensional sexuality\" in an article for ''[[Sexual and Relationship Therapy]]'', a theoretical framework in which gender is not the primary factor in sexual attraction, rather it is one of many axes. These other axes of attraction can include the desire for either monogamy or polyamory, and the fluidity of desire for the various gender(s) in a partner over time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilde|first=Jen\u00e9e|year=2014|title=Dimensional sexuality: exploring new frameworks for bisexual desires|journal=Sexual & Relationship Therapy|volume=29|issue=3|pages=320\u2013338|issn=1468-1994|doi=10.1080/14681994.2014.919377}}</ref> Wilde uses her framework to broaden the scale of sexual identity from a simple binary spectrum from \"mono-sexual\" to \"bisexual\", and to establish relationships between these identities; these relationships would not alienate individuals without a single \"fixed object\" of attraction.\n\nViewpoints like Wilde's have been applied by scholars such as Laura Erickson-Schroth and Jennifer Mitchell<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Erickson-Schroth|first=Laura|last2=Mitchell|first2=Jennifer|year=2009|title=Queering Queer Theory, or Why Bisexuality matters|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=9|issue=3|pages=297\u2013315|doi=10.1080/15299710903316596}}</ref> to pieces of pop-culture and literature; Steven Angelides also produced a book on the place of bisexuality in research and societal awareness throughout history, using a similar framework.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=A History of Bisexuality|last=Angelides|first=Steven|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-226-02089-1|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|via=WorldCat}}</ref>  Both pieces aim to achieve more inclusive readings of sexuality and allow for the re-designation of literary figures and real people as bisexual, rather than continuing with the assumption that any same-gender activity, explicit or implied, is homosexual, and any opposite-gender activity heterosexual.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAn example of a viewpoint similar to Wilde's is D.S. Neff's reading of Lord Byron's [[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage|''Childe'' ''Harold's Pilgrimage'']], which finds that the poem is ambiguous in its mentioning of \"concubines and carnal companie\" as well as later parts of the work; Neff finds these ambiguities to be implications that both male and female lovers were had by the protagonist. This bisexual portrayal is supported through Byron's real-world interactions with lovers of multiple genders, and the culture of his literary affiliates at Cambridge condoning those interactions in the midst of the 19th century's moral panic around same-gender desires.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neff|first=D.S.|year=2002|title=Bitches, mollies, and tommies: Byron, masculinity, and the history of sexualities|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=11|issue=3|pages=395\u2013438|issn=1043-4070|doi=10.1353/sex.2003.0019|pmid=17354358}}</ref>\n\nErickson-Schroth and Mitchell's 2009 article in the ''[[Journal of Bisexuality]]'' performs a similar analysis of ''[[Written on the Body]]'' by [[Jeanette Winterson]] and ''[[Well of Loneliness]]'' by [[Radclyffe Hall]]; the assertion behind these scholars' work is that bisexual experience has existed all throughout the history of humanity, and while it has only recently been acknowledged even in queer and LGBT circles, it is in no way an exclusively modern phenomenon.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere are also interpretations of literature that focus on the symbolic expressions of bisexuality rather than its explicit mention.

Despite being bisexual in fantasy and activity, these men identify as \"gay\" or \"straight\" rather than as bisexual. This erasure of bisexuality is sometimes caused by denying the significance of an erotic encounter in order to maintain a person's [[sexual identity]] and sense of community; a man might downplay having had sexual fantasies or encounters with a woman in order to maintain his identity as a \"gay man\" and his membership in the gay community, or a man might downplay having had sexual fantasies or encounters with a man in order to maintain his status as a heterosexual man in [[heteronormative]] society.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=[[SpringerLink]] |doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-0737-2_14 |title = Denial|pages=219\u2013230 |year = 1989|last1 = Friedman|first1 = Richard C.|isbn=978-1-4612-8057-6 |chapter=Denial in the Development of Homosexual Men }}</ref>\n\nWriting for [[Bisexual.org]], author and columnist Zachary Zane cites a study showing that 20.7% of straight-identified men watched [[gay pornography]] and 7.5% reported having sex with a man in the past six months, while 55% of gay-identified men had watched heterosexual pornography and 0.7% reported having sex with a woman in the past six months. He argues that some of the straight-identified men are actually gay or bisexual but are erasing their bisexuality due to internalized biphobia and denial in order to claim a straight identity label. Pointing out that the majority of gay-identified men watched heterosexual pornography but few had recent heterosexual sex, he suggests that many self-identified gay men have sexual fantasies about women and in an ideal world would be openly bisexual and freely explore sex with women, but society pressures gay men to \"pick a side\" so those men \"subsequently have picked being gay\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zane|first1=Zachary|title=1 in 5 Straight-Identifying Men Watch Same-sex Porn: Are They All Closeted|url=https://bisexual.org/1-in-5-straight-identifying-men-watch-same-sex-porn-are-they-all-closeted/|website=Bisexual.org|publisher=The American Institute of Bisexuality|date=October 20, 2016|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nBisexual author and activist [[Robyn Ochs]] has argued that gay men are less possessive of their \"gay\" label than [[lesbians]] are of their label. She argues that there is less hostility to bisexual men who identify as gay than bisexual women who identify as lesbian, that there is a great deal of [[sexual fluidity]] between gay men and bisexual men, and that consequently more gay-identified men openly admit to being attracted to and having sex with women. However, Ochs also argues that many bisexual men identify as gay in order to politically align themselves with the gay community. She says that since coming out is so difficult for gay men, many do not want to come out a second time as bisexual; the existence of male bisexuality can be threatening to some gay men because it raises the possibility that they themselves might be bisexual.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://robynochs.com/biphobia-it-goes-more-than-two-ways/ |title=BIPHOBIA: IT GOES MORE THAN TWO WAYS |publisher=[[Robyn Ochs|robynochs.com]] |accessdate=2017-10-22|date=2015-03-11 }}</ref>\n\nGay male activist [[Carl Wittman]], writing in his \"Refugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifesto\", argued that gay men should identify as \"gay\" rather than as \"bisexual\", even if they sleep with women. Stating that gay men should only become bisexual once society accepts homosexuality, he wrote that:{{quote|Bisexuality is good; it is the capacity to love people of either sex. The reason so few of us are bisexual is because society made such a big stink about homosexuality that we got forced into seeing ourselves as either straight or non-straight. Also, many gays go turned off to the ways men are supposed to act with women and vice-versa, which is pretty f---ed-up. Gays will begin to turn on to women when 1) it's something that we do because we want to, and not because we should, and 2) when women's liberation changes the nature of heterosexual relationships. We continue to call ourselves homosexual, not bisexual, even if we do make it with the opposite sex also, because saying \"Oh, I'm Bi\" is a copout for a gay. We get told it's OK to sleep with guys as long as we sleep with women, too, and that's still putting homosexuality down. We'll be gay until everyone has forgotten that it's an issue.

These other axes of attraction can include the desire for either monogamy or polyamory, and the fluidity of desire for the various gender(s) in a partner over time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilde|first=Jen\u00e9e|year=2014|title=Dimensional sexuality: exploring new frameworks for bisexual desires|journal=Sexual & Relationship Therapy|volume=29|issue=3|pages=320\u2013338|issn=1468-1994|doi=10.1080/14681994.2014.919377}}</ref> Wilde uses her framework to broaden the scale of sexual identity from a simple binary spectrum from \"mono-sexual\" to \"bisexual\", and to establish relationships between these identities; these relationships would not alienate individuals without a single \"fixed object\" of attraction.\n\nViewpoints like Wilde's have been applied by scholars such as Laura Erickson-Schroth and Jennifer Mitchell<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Erickson-Schroth|first=Laura|last2=Mitchell|first2=Jennifer|year=2009|title=Queering Queer Theory, or Why Bisexuality matters|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=9|issue=3|pages=297\u2013315|doi=10.1080/15299710903316596}}</ref> to pieces of pop-culture and literature; Steven Angelides also produced a book on the place of bisexuality in research and societal awareness throughout history, using a similar framework.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=A History of Bisexuality|last=Angelides|first=Steven|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-226-02089-1|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|via=WorldCat}}</ref>  Both pieces aim to achieve more inclusive readings of sexuality and allow for the re-designation of literary figures and real people as bisexual, rather than continuing with the assumption that any same-gender activity, explicit or implied, is homosexual, and any opposite-gender activity heterosexual.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAn example of a viewpoint similar to Wilde's is D.S. Neff's reading of Lord Byron's [[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage|''Childe'' ''Harold's Pilgrimage'']], which finds that the poem is ambiguous in its mentioning of \"concubines and carnal companie\" as well as later parts of the work; Neff finds these ambiguities to be implications that both male and female lovers were had by the protagonist. This bisexual portrayal is supported through Byron's real-world interactions with lovers of multiple genders, and the culture of his literary affiliates at Cambridge condoning those interactions in the midst of the 19th century's moral panic around same-gender desires.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neff|first=D.S.|year=2002|title=Bitches, mollies, and tommies: Byron, masculinity, and the history of sexualities|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=11|issue=3|pages=395\u2013438|issn=1043-4070|doi=10.1353/sex.2003.0019|pmid=17354358}}</ref>\n\nErickson-Schroth and Mitchell's 2009 article in the ''[[Journal of Bisexuality]]'' performs a similar analysis of ''[[Written on the Body]]'' by [[Jeanette Winterson]] and ''[[Well of Loneliness]]'' by [[Radclyffe Hall]]; the assertion behind these scholars' work is that bisexual experience has existed all throughout the history of humanity, and while it has only recently been acknowledged even in queer and LGBT circles, it is in no way an exclusively modern phenomenon.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere are also interpretations of literature that focus on the symbolic expressions of bisexuality rather than its explicit mention.  Linda K.

Custody issues arise due to the belief that bisexual people are too unstable to be parents, while bisexuals seeking asylum from countries hostile to LGBT individuals are viewed with suspicion, including not being \"gay enough.\" This is due to a common assumption within the legal community that a person can only be legitimately attracted to one gender; therefore, a bisexual asylum-seeker is more likely to be considered a fraud.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|LGBT}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Bialogue]]\n* [[Bisexual politics]]\n* [[Denialism]]\n* [[False dichotomy]]\n* [[Heteronormativity]]\n* [[Heterosexism]]\n* [[Homonegativity]]\n* [[Homophobia]]\n*[[Lesbian erasure]]\n*[[Pansexuality]]\n*[[Social invisibility]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n<!-- If a reading source is used as a citation in the article, please remove it from this section. -->\n\n* {{cite web|last1=Aaron|first1=Michael|title=Beyond Binary: How Bisexuality Shifts Orientation Science|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/standard-deviations/201705/beyond-binary-how-bisexuality-shifts-orientation-science|work=[[Psychology Today]]|date=May 8, 2017}}\n* {{cite web|last1=Barkved|first1=Kayti|title=Bisexuality and pansexuality are two different identities|url=http://www.thephoenixnews.com/2014/11/bisexuality-and-pansexuality-are-two-different-identities/|work=The Phoenix|publisher=[[University of British Columbia Okanagan]]|date=November 3, 2014}}\n* {{cite web|last1=Carey|first1=Benedict|title=Straight, Gay or Lying?

For example, certain [[autoimmune disease]]s may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] cases are women, whereas [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is more common in men. Gender-based medicine, also called \"gender medicine\", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. Similar findings are also reported in the sport medicine literature where males typically account for >60% of the individuals studied.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Where are all the female participants in Sports and Exercise Medicine research?|journal = European Journal of Sport Science|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1536-7290|pmid = 24766579|pages = 847\u2013851|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17461391.2014.911354|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Francois|last2 = Bieuzen|first3 = Chris M.|last3 = Bleakley|url = https://eprints.qut.edu.au/69202/3/69202.pdf}}</ref> The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients.

These can be of several types, including direct and indirect, direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome (due to the [[SRY gene]]), and indirect being characteristics influenced indirectly (e.g., hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.\n\nDirect sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression, although the deviations in more complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions.\n\nIndirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e., normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. {{synthesis inline span|For example, most [[males]] are taller than most [[females]],<ref name=\"Gustafsson\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson A, Lindenfors P|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Human size evolution: no allometric relationship between male and female stature | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=47 | pages=253\u2013266 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.07.004 | pmid=15454336 | issue=4}}</ref> but an individual female could be shorter than an individual male.

An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, [[testosterone]] or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor. Crime can be measured by such data as arrest records, imprisonment rates, and surveys. However, not all crimes are reported or investigated. Moreover, some studies show that men can have an overwhelming bias against reporting themselves to be the victims of a crime (particularly when victimized by a woman), and some studies have argued that men reporting [[intimate partner violence]] find disadvantageous biases in law enforcement.<ref>\"[M]en who are involved in disputes with their partners, whether as alleged victims or as alleged offenders or both, are disadvantaged and treated less favorably than women by the law-enforcement system at almost every step.\" Brown, G.

For example, certain [[autoimmune disease]]s may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] cases are women, whereas [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is more common in men. Gender-based medicine, also called \"gender medicine\", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. Similar findings are also reported in the sport medicine literature where males typically account for >60% of the individuals studied.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Where are all the female participants in Sports and Exercise Medicine research?|journal = European Journal of Sport Science|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1536-7290|pmid = 24766579|pages = 847\u2013851|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17461391.2014.911354|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Francois|last2 = Bieuzen|first3 = Chris M.|last3 = Bleakley|url = https://eprints.qut.edu.au/69202/3/69202.pdf}}</ref> The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients.

These can be of several types, including direct and indirect, direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome (due to the [[SRY gene]]), and indirect being characteristics influenced indirectly (e.g., hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.\n\nDirect sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression, although the deviations in more complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions.\n\nIndirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e., normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. {{synthesis inline span|For example, most [[males]] are taller than most [[females]],<ref name=\"Gustafsson\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson A, Lindenfors P|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Human size evolution: no allometric relationship between male and female stature | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=47 | pages=253\u2013266 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.07.004 | pmid=15454336 | issue=4}}</ref> but an individual female could be taller than an individual male.

The research focused on cognitive variables (for example, reading comprehension, mathematics), communication (for example, talkativeness, facial expressions), social and personality (for example, aggression, sexuality), psychological well-being, and motor behaviors. Using results from a review of 46 meta-analyses, she found that 78% of gender differences were small or close to zero. A few exceptions were some motor behaviors (such as throwing distance) and some aspects of sexuality (such as attitudes about casual sex), which show the largest gender differences.

An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, [[testosterone]] or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor. Crime can be measured by such data as arrest records, imprisonment rates, and surveys. However, not all crimes are reported or investigated. Moreover, some studies show that men can have an overwhelming bias against reporting themselves to be the victims of a crime (particularly when victimized by a woman), and some studies have argued that men reporting [[intimate partner violence]] find disadvantageous biases in law enforcement.<ref>\"[M]en who are involved in disputes with their partners, whether as alleged victims or as alleged offenders or both, are disadvantaged and treated less favorably than women by the law-enforcement system at almost every step.\" Brown, G.

A founding queen searches for a hollow tree, wall cavity, rock crevice, or even a mammal-made hole to build a nest. One colony cycle lasts for about 6\u201311 months and each colony cycle consists of around 3000\u20138000 larvae.\n\nThe extraordinary adaptation skills of ''V. vulgaris'' enable it to live in a wide range of habitats, from very humid areas to artificial environments such as gardens and human structures. This species, along with other wasp species such as ''V. germanica'', has impacted the ecosystem, especially those in New Zealand and Australia, where they were imported by humans, and frequently cause damage to fruit crops and endanger humans.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |url= |title=Variation in Colour Marking of German Wasps Vespula germanica (F.) and Common Wasps Vespula vulgaris (L.)

Instead, each has only one black mark on its [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|''clypeus'']], which is usually anchor or dagger-shaped. However, identification of this species may be difficult because the black mark on its ''clypeus'' can sometimes appear broken, making it again look similar to ''V. germanica''.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nStill more difficult to distinguish between species are the males. Almost undetectable with the naked eye, the only confident identification of ''V. vulgaris'' males is to seek the distinct ''[[aedeagus]]'' tip shapes and lateral processes of their [[genitalia]].<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''V. vulgaris'' is a [[Palearctic]] species.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/> It was discovered in a wide range of countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, India, and China. It is invasive in New Zealand and Australia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Until 2010, it was thought to be in North America as well, but molecular and morphological data showed that specimens identified as ''V. vulgaris'' in North America were ''Vespula alascensis'', which had previously been considered a taxonomic synonym, but is now considered a separate species.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' has high adaptation skills for environments. It flourishes in most types of habitats, including prairie, grassland, natural and planted forests, shrub lands, and even in urban zones such as gardens, orchards, and buildings. However, it does require the temperature to be moderately warm, because its [[foraging]] activity is temperature-dependent (above 2 \u00b0C).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Northern Hemisphere colony cycle==\nFive distinguishable stages occur in ''V. vulgaris'' colony cycle in the temperate parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Each lasts for similar periods, around 30\u201335 days. The colony starts in April as the queen begins the foundation of the nest and degenerates around October when the temperature drops and the queen dies. The size of the colony ranges from 3000 [[larvae]] up to a maximum of 8000 larvae, with the queen producing around 200\u2013300 eggs per day for 24 days.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite book |last1=Potter |first1=N.B. |title=A Study of the Biology of the Common Wasp, ''Vespula vulgaris'' L., with Special Reference to the Foraging Behavior |date=1964 |publisher=University of Bristol |location=Bristol |pages=5\u201360}}</ref>\n\n*Stage 1 \u2013 solitary stage: the queen builds the nest, provisions the cells and rears the first brood of workers.\n*Stage 2 \u2013 rapid increase: the workers replace the queen as the foraging force. The queen is now a nurse and egg producer. There is very rapid buildup of worker population.\n*Stage 3 \u2013 slow increase: the rate of population growth is not as rapid as in stage 2.\n*Stage 4 \u2013 climax of colony: worker population no longer increases. Cells built are all queen cells. Males emerge, and foraging rate per worker increases.\n*Stage 5 \u2013 decline: probably caused by death or sickness of queen. Colony cohesion breaks down, cannibalism sets in, and the foraging becomes erratic.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Brood production==\nThe general incubation period is five days, but it can occasionally be seven, due to [[cannibalism]], [[scavenging]] or replacement. The larval period can depend on the trophic condition inside and outside the nest. If there are abundant resources of food being brought into the nest, the larval period is short, but if the resource is short, the period can lengthen. The first adult emerges after around 23 days of hatching and the queen-pupated brood is completed in about a month (30 days).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe first brood of workers are all of normal size, but the next generation of them is generally smaller, due to a decrease in the queen's foraging activity after producing the first batch of larvae. As the queen's foraging decreases, the second group of workers does not get so much food, often starves, and so spends more time in the larval stage.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Nest foundation by the queen==\nAfter coming out of hibernation in the spring, the queen forages for flowers or shrubs and begins looking for nesting sites. She flies low on the ground, searching for any round, dark object or depression. If it is a hole, she flies in to inspect the details if it is suitable and if not moves on to the next hole. What constitutes a \"perfect\" nest is yet to be discovered, but it is mainly speculated that the queen's physiological state is the main deciding factor of the time and the place of nesting. When she has found a suitable site for nesting, she performs dance-like wing movements which allow her to locate the site even after she has left the area.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |last1=M.

She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a [[wikt:spindle|spindle]] and flying back out to bring in more pulp. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her [[anterior]] legs and mouth parts.<ref name=\":5\" /> She builds 20\u201330 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a [[Petiole (insect)|petiole]] and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.<ref name=\"TeAra\" />\n\nWhen the nest is completed, the queen is replaced by the workers as the foraging force and instead is now concerned only with nursing and egg producing. Her ovaries develop, her abdomen becomes distended with eggs, and she loses the ability to fly.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter the founding phase has been completed, the colony encounters a change where the workers begin to build queen cells. Once the workers start building on the queen cells, no more worker cells are built, but those that still have brood growing in them are retained. The majority of the food resource brought in by the workers is fed to the queen larvae, known as [[gynes]] and the lack of feeding for other larvae causes the prolongation of their larval periods.<ref name=\":6\" /> To ensure that only the queen's eggs are reared to adulthood, female workers remove worker-laid eggs in a process known as [[worker policing]].\n\nWhen the queen has completed her job of producing daughter queen larvae, she dies, leaving a crop of virgin queens which will leave the nest, mate, hibernate, and reproduce in the following spring. After the queen's death, the coordination of the colony breaks down and the workers begin to lay eggs. The rate and amount of foraging decrease drastically after the queen's death, so it is unable to support all the workers and their brood. This is when [[cannibalism]] occurs among the workers and furthermore, the workers tear off their cells and carry them out of the nest, dropping the temperature of the entire nest. Once this stage is reached, the remaining workers die of cold or starvation.<ref name=\":11\">{{cite journal |last1=R. J. |first1=Harris |last2=J.

The wasps produce a chemical which repels ants and secrete it around the base of the petiole, to avoid ant predation.<ref name=\"doc\" />\n\nMany variations are seen in the characteristics of the nests within the species. Aerial nests and nests that are very close to the surface of the ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. The wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better it will be in conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal |last1=R. |first1=Sailer |title=Nest temperature in the common yellow-jacket |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society |date=1950 |volume=23 |pages=134\u2013137}}</ref>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' wasps recognize their nests by making [[pheromone]] trails from the entrance of their nest to the site of foraging.

''Vespula germanica'' generally have slightly bigger nest size (3500\u20139000 larvae in one colony cycle) than ''Vespula vulgaris'' (3000\u20138000 larvae in one colony cycle).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=B.

She flies frontwards and backwards in front of the nest with a slow, hovering flight and repeats this movement until its distance is further away from the hole. When the arc of the flight increases up to about 6 ft (183 cm), the pathway makes a figure of a sideways \"8\" and when the queen is about 60 ft (18 m) away from the nest site, she then flies in a straight line. This is how the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' marks the land, in respect to the landmarks around the nesting site.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Defensive behaviors===\nOnly wasps leaving the nest notice a disturbance and defend or fight off an intruder. The ones returning to the nest do not detect any disturbance and try to enter the nest. The workers that detect danger show a certain gesture \u2013 they rise onto the tips of their [[Arthropod leg#Tarsus|tarsi]], put forward their heads, turn down their abdomens and constantly vibrate their wings in high frequencies and short beats. This behavior signals other workers to fly to the entrance of the nest and defend. However, if the nest is disturbed enough times, the workers stop defending the nest and instead grow tolerant to such attacks.<ref name=\":5\" /> However, when they detect life-threatening level of danger, the ''Vespula vulgaris'' workers will vigorously defend their nest. Unlike honey bees, which die after stinging, ''Vespula vulgaris'' can sting multiple times. This makes its sting viable for personal defense when away from the colony, and the common wasp is therefore more apt to sting. However, it will usually not sting without being provoked by sudden movement or other violent behavior.\n\nResearch indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":8\" /> ''Vespula vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with [[honey bees]] for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island black beech forests.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===Over-wintering behaviors===\nAfter mating, the queen overwinters in a hole or other sheltered location, sometimes in buildings. Wasp nests are not reused from one year to the next, but in rare instances wasps have been seen to re-nest in the footprint of a removed nest or even begin building a new nest within an old nest. In the mild climate of New Zealand and Australia, a few of the colonies may survive the winter, although this is much more common with the [[German wasp]].<ref name=\"doc\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==Factors affecting foraging==\nThe foraging activity of ''Vespula vulgaris'' is dependent on the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2\u00b0 C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2\u00b0 C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be \u2013 i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blackith |first1=R. E. |title=Visual sensitivity and foraging in social wasps |journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1007/bf02224066 |year=1958}}</ref>\n\nThe foraging activities of ''Vespula vulgaris'' are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is to satisfy the larval requirements. The workers fly off early in the morning to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The second reason is to maximize fluid foraging. Because [[dew]]s and [[nectar]]s are most abundant early in the morning and are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGenerally, wasps are unable to predict heavy rainfalls. They continue their foraging activities even in the rain, but cease when the rain becomes torrential. When the rainfall becomes extremely heavy near the nesting site, the workers rapidly return to their nests. Those whose foraging activities were interrupted by heavy rainfall become reluctant to forage again in the future, even when the weather is dry and calm. Those who continue to forage do so mainly for fluid.\n\nThe average life span of an adult ''Vespula vulgaris'' is known to be around two weeks (14 days). There was a negative correlation found between the age of the worker ''Vespula vulgaris'' and their respective foraging speeds, and a positive correlation between their age and the amount of time each worker spent in the nest between each foraging trip. The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they got older. Wasps that are over 30 days, in fact, generally cease from foraging trips and spend all of their time guarding the entrance of the nest.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Diet==\nSimilarly to other ''Vespulas'', ''Vespula vulgaris'' feed on animal preys such as caterpillars to feed their developing larvae and [[carbohydrate]]s, such as nectar and sweet fruits, to satisfy their own energy requirements.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal |last1=Spradbery |first1=J.

This is mainly due to the size difference of the two species. Because the ''Vespula germanica'' foragers are bigger in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] than those of ''Vespula vulgaris'', and they both transport the prey by carrying on them, it would be advantageous for the wasp to be bigger to be able to hold larger prey.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==Caste system==\nIn the early stage of the colony founding, the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' does most of the work, both building and foraging. After the nest is completely built, she expands her foraging resources from only pulps to pulps, fluids and insect flesh. The labor divides as the first batch of larvae is hatched. However, during the very beginning of the hatching, the workers do not take part of any labor. Rather, they remain motionless with their heads inside a cell. Workers actually start foraging actively after seven days. They both forage and take care of the broods by feeding the larvae, breaking down the insect flesh, dividing fluids collected by the foragers, removing trophallactic secretion from the larvae, and fixing the nests.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Queen==\nOne possible factor that determines a female's social caste is known to be its nest position. The location of each cell is directly related to the amount of food a larva can receive, and the queen cell, being located at the very bottom of the nest, encounters the foragers before any other cell. Therefore, it gets most of the food and naturally, yields the biggest female \u2013 the queen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs mentioned above, the cell location can alter the size of the larva and eventually determine which female ''Vespula vulgaris'' is going to be queen. However, when several candidates of queens arise, there is competition among them. Certain variations among them rank the [[hierarchy]] of the queens and thus select the ultimate queen. Although the precise causes of the variations in the queens are still unknown, one possible factor is the amount of fat stored in the queen's body. Smaller developing queens have less fat stored, and thus have relatively higher mortality rates in winter than larger queens. The bigger the size and larger the amount of fat stored, the \"higher\" the queen is considered in quality, and she is able to out-compete other queens in finding a fit mate. She will then have an advantage in establishing a nest in the following spring.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nIn order for the ''Vespula vulgaris'' queen to dominate all the workers \u2013 usually numbering more than 3000 in a colony  \u2013she possesses a special chemical that sends signals of dominance. The workers were discovered to regularly lick the queen while feeding her, and the air-borne [[pheromone]] from the queen's body alerts those workers of her dominance.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Pest status==\nAlong with the German wasp and two species of ''[[Polistes]]'' (all [[invasive species]]), the common wasp is considered a pest species in New Zealand, as it competes with [[Endemism|endemic]] species for food, such as insects and [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://www.envbop.govt.nz/Factsheets/PestAnimal-090526-PA03.pdf |date=November 2004 |publisher=[[Environment Bay of Plenty]] |title=Wasps |work=Pest Animal Control}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The vulgar wasp: the story of a ruthless invader and ingenious predator |last=Lester, Phil, 1969-|isbn=9781776561858 |location=Wellington |oclc=1031341683|date = April 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" /> In some [[South Island]] beech forests it is thought that densities of wasps are higher than anywhere else in the world.<ref name=doc>{{cite web |title=Vespula Wasp Factsheet |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803073040/http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 August 2012 |publisher=Department of Conservation |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> It is calculated that the total weight of common wasps in these places may exceed that of all birds.<ref name=TeAra>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Story: Wasps and bees |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wasps-and-bees/3 |encyclopedia=Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" />\n\nResearch indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |pmid=16158272 |year=2005 |last1=Steinmetz |first1=I |last2=Schmolz |first2=E |title=Nest odor dynamics in the social wasp Vespula vulgaris |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=414\u20138 |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0006-9 |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|bibcode=2005NW.....92..414S}}</ref> ''V. vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with honey bees for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island [[black beech]] forests.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite journal |last=Markwell |first=T.

A founding queen searches for a hollow tree, wall cavity, rock crevice, or even a mammal-made hole to build a nest. One colony cycle lasts for about 6\u201311 months and each colony cycle consists of around 3000\u20138000 larvae.\n\nThe extraordinary adaptation skills of ''V. vulgaris'' enable it to live in a wide range of habitats, from very humid areas to artificial environments such as gardens and human structures. This species, along with other wasp species such as ''V. germanica'', has impacted the ecosystem, especially those in New Zealand and Australia, where they were imported by humans, and frequently cause damage to fruit crops and endanger humans.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |url= |title=Variation in Colour Marking of German Wasps Vespula germanica (F.) and Common Wasps Vespula vulgaris (L.)

Instead, each has only one black mark on its [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|''clypeus'']], which is usually anchor or dagger-shaped. However, identification of this species may be difficult because the black mark on its ''clypeus'' can sometimes appear broken, making it again look similar to ''V. germanica''.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nStill more difficult to distinguish between species are the males. Almost undetectable with the naked eye, the only confident identification of ''V. vulgaris'' males is to seek the distinct ''[[aedeagus]]'' tip shapes and lateral processes of their [[genitalia]].<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''V. vulgaris'' is a [[Palearctic]] species.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/> It was discovered in a wide range of countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, India, and China. It is invasive in New Zealand and Australia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Until 2010, it was thought to be in North America as well, but molecular and morphological data showed that specimens identified as ''V. vulgaris'' in North America were ''Vespula alascensis'', which had previously been considered a taxonomic synonym, but is now considered a separate species.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' has high adaptation skills for environments. It flourishes in most types of habitats, including prairie, grassland, natural and planted forests, shrub lands, and even in urban zones such as gardens, orchards, and buildings. However, it does require the temperature to be moderately warm, because its [[foraging]] activity is temperature-dependent (above 2 \u00b0C).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Northern Hemisphere colony cycle==\nFive distinguishable stages occur in ''V. vulgaris'' colony cycle in the temperate parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Each lasts for similar periods, around 30\u201335 days. The colony starts in April as the queen begins the foundation of the nest and degenerates around October when the temperature drops and the queen dies. The size of the colony ranges from 3000 [[larvae]] up to a maximum of 8000 larvae, with the queen producing around 200\u2013300 eggs per day for 24 days.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite book |last1=Potter |first1=N.B. |title=A Study of the Biology of the Common Wasp, ''Vespula vulgaris'' L., with Special Reference to the Foraging Behavior |date=1964 |publisher=University of Bristol |location=Bristol |pages=5\u201360}}</ref>\n\n*Stage 1 \u2013 solitary stage: the queen builds the nest, provisions the cells and rears the first brood of workers.\n*Stage 2 \u2013 rapid increase: the workers replace the queen as the foraging force.

There is very rapid buildup of worker population.\n*Stage 3 \u2013 slow increase: the rate of population growth is not as rapid as in stage 2.\n*Stage 4 \u2013 climax of colony: worker population no longer increases. Cells built are all queen cells. Males emerge, and foraging rate per worker increases.\n*Stage 5 \u2013 decline: probably caused by death or sickness of queen. Colony cohesion breaks down, cannibalism sets in, and the foraging becomes erratic.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Brood production==\nThe general incubation period is five days, but it can occasionally be seven, due to [[cannibalism]], [[scavenging]] or replacement. The larval period can depend on the trophic condition inside and outside the nest. If there are abundant resources of food being brought into the nest, the larval period is short, but if the resource is short, the period can lengthen. The first adult emerges after around 23 days of hatching and the queen-pupated brood is completed in about a month (30 days).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe first brood of workers are all of normal size, but the next generation of them is generally smaller, due to a decrease in the queen's foraging activity after producing the first batch of larvae. As the queen's foraging decreases, the second group of workers does not get so much food, often starves, and so spends more time in the larval stage.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Nest foundation by the queen==\nAfter coming out of hibernation in the spring, the queen forages for flowers or shrubs and begins looking for nesting sites. She flies low on the ground, searching for any round, dark object or depression. If it is a hole, she flies in to inspect the details if it is suitable and if not moves on to the next hole. What constitutes a \"perfect\" nest is yet to be discovered, but it is mainly speculated that the queen's physiological state is the main deciding factor of the time and the place of nesting. When she has found a suitable site for nesting, she performs dance-like wing movements which allow her to locate the site even after she has left the area.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |last1=M.

She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a [[wikt:spindle|spindle]] and flying back out to bring in more pulp. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her [[anterior]] legs and mouth parts.<ref name=\":5\" /> She builds 20\u201330 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a [[Petiole (insect)|petiole]] and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.<ref name=\"TeAra\" />\n\nWhen the nest is completed, the queen is replaced by the workers as the foraging force and instead is now concerned only with nursing and egg producing. Her ovaries develop, her abdomen becomes distended with eggs, and she loses the ability to fly.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter the founding phase has been completed, the colony encounters a change where the workers begin to build queen cells. Once the workers start building on the queen cells, no more worker cells are built, but those that still have brood growing in them are retained. The majority of the food resource brought in by the workers is fed to the queen larvae, known as [[gynes]] and the lack of feeding for other larvae causes the prolongation of their larval periods.<ref name=\":6\" /> To ensure that only the queen's eggs are reared to adulthood, female workers remove worker-laid eggs in a process known as [[worker policing]].\n\nWhen the queen has completed her job of producing daughter queen larvae, she dies, leaving a crop of virgin queens which will leave the nest, mate, hibernate, and reproduce in the following spring. After the queen's death, the coordination of the colony breaks down and the workers begin to lay eggs. The rate and amount of foraging decrease drastically after the queen's death, so it is unable to support all the workers and their brood. This is when [[cannibalism]] occurs among the workers and furthermore, the workers tear off their cells and carry them out of the nest, dropping the temperature of the entire nest. Once this stage is reached, the remaining workers die of cold or starvation.<ref name=\":11\">{{cite journal |last1=R. J. |first1=Harris |last2=J.

Aerial nests and nests that are very close to the surface of the ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. The wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better it will be in conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C.

She flies frontwards and backwards in front of the nest with a slow, hovering flight and repeats this movement until its distance is further away from the hole. When the arc of the flight increases up to about 6 ft (183 cm), the pathway makes a figure of a sideways \"8\" and when the queen is about 60 ft (18 m) away from the nest site, she then flies in a straight line. This is how the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' marks the land, in respect to the landmarks around the nesting site.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Defensive behaviors===\nOnly wasps leaving the nest notice a disturbance and defend or fight off an intruder. The ones returning to the nest do not detect any disturbance and try to enter the nest. The workers that detect danger show a certain gesture \u2013 they rise onto the tips of their [[Arthropod leg#Tarsus|tarsi]], put forward their heads, turn down their abdomens and constantly vibrate their wings in high frequencies and short beats. This behavior signals other workers to fly to the entrance of the nest and defend. However, if the nest is disturbed enough times, the workers stop defending the nest and instead grow tolerant to such attacks.<ref name=\":5\" /> However, when they detect life-threatening level of danger, the ''Vespula vulgaris'' workers will vigorously defend their nest. Unlike honey bees, which die after stinging, ''Vespula vulgaris'' can sting multiple times. This makes its sting viable for personal defense when away from the colony, and the common wasp is therefore more apt to sting. However, it will usually not sting without being provoked by sudden movement or other violent behavior.\n\nResearch indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":8\" /> ''Vespula vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with [[honey bees]] for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island black beech forests.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===Over-wintering behaviors===\nAfter mating, the queen overwinters in a hole or other sheltered location, sometimes in buildings. Wasp nests are not reused from one year to the next, but in rare instances wasps have been seen to re-nest in the footprint of a removed nest or even begin building a new nest within an old nest. In the mild climate of New Zealand and Australia, a few of the colonies may survive the winter, although this is much more common with the [[German wasp]].<ref name=\"doc\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==Factors affecting foraging==\nThe foraging activity of ''Vespula vulgaris'' is dependent on the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2\u00b0 C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2\u00b0 C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be \u2013 i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blackith |first1=R. E. |title=Visual sensitivity and foraging in social wasps |journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1007/bf02224066 |year=1958}}</ref>\n\nThe foraging activities of ''Vespula vulgaris'' are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is to satisfy the larval requirements. The workers fly off early in the morning to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The second reason is to maximize fluid foraging. Because [[dew]]s and [[nectar]]s are most abundant early in the morning and are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGenerally, wasps are unable to predict heavy rainfalls. They continue their foraging activities even in the rain, but cease when the rain becomes torrential. When the rainfall becomes extremely heavy near the nesting site, the workers rapidly return to their nests. Those whose foraging activities were interrupted by heavy rainfall become reluctant to forage again in the future, even when the weather is dry and calm. Those who continue to forage do so mainly for fluid.\n\nThe average life span of an adult ''Vespula vulgaris'' is known to be around two weeks (14 days). There was a negative correlation found between the age of the worker ''Vespula vulgaris'' and their respective foraging speeds, and a positive correlation between their age and the amount of time each worker spent in the nest between each foraging trip. The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they got older. Wasps that are over 30 days, in fact, generally cease from foraging trips and spend all of their time guarding the entrance of the nest.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Diet==\nSimilarly to other ''Vespulas'', ''Vespula vulgaris'' feed on animal preys such as caterpillars to feed their developing larvae and [[carbohydrate]]s, such as nectar and sweet fruits, to satisfy their own energy requirements.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal |last1=Spradbery |first1=J. P. |title=Wasps: an account of the biology and natural history of solitary and social wasps |journal=London, Sidgwick & Jackson |date=1973 |page=508}}</ref> Their usual food sources are: wood pulp, freshly killed insects such as [[Hymenoptera]], [[lepidopteran]] larvae and [[Diptera]] and Spiders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Harris |title=Diet of the Wasps Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica in Honeydew Beech Forest of the South Island, New Zealand |journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology |date=1991 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1080/03014223.1991.10757963}}</ref> Common wasps will also attempt to invade honey bees' nests to steal their honey.\n\nAlthough the types of prey ''Vespula vulgaris'' and ''Vespula germanica'' forage are almost the same, that of ''Vespula germanica'' are generally 2\u20133.5 times bigger and heavier than that of ''Vespula vulgaris''. This is mainly due to the size difference of the two species. Because the ''Vespula germanica'' foragers are bigger in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] than those of ''Vespula vulgaris'', and they both transport the prey by carrying on them, it would be advantageous for the wasp to be bigger to be able to hold larger prey.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==Caste system==\nIn the early stage of the colony founding, the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' does most of the work, both building and foraging. After the nest is completely built, she expands her foraging resources from only pulps to pulps, fluids and insect flesh. The labor divides as the first batch of larvae is hatched. However, during the very beginning of the hatching, the workers do not take part of any labor. Rather, they remain motionless with their heads inside a cell. Workers actually start foraging actively after seven days. They both forage and take care of the broods by feeding the larvae, breaking down the insect flesh, dividing fluids collected by the foragers, removing trophallactic secretion from the larvae, and fixing the nests.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Queen==\nOne possible factor that determines a female's social caste is known to be its nest position. The location of each cell is directly related to the amount of food a larva can receive, and the queen cell, being located at the very bottom of the nest, encounters the foragers before any other cell. Therefore, it gets most of the food and naturally, yields the biggest female \u2013 the queen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs mentioned above, the cell location can alter the size of the larva and eventually determine which female ''Vespula vulgaris'' is going to be queen. However, when several candidates of queens arise, there is competition among them. Certain variations among them rank the [[hierarchy]] of the queens and thus select the ultimate queen. Although the precise causes of the variations in the queens are still unknown, one possible factor is the amount of fat stored in the queen's body. Smaller developing queens have less fat stored, and thus have relatively higher mortality rates in winter than larger queens. The bigger the size and larger the amount of fat stored, the \"higher\" the queen is considered in quality, and she is able to out-compete other queens in finding a fit mate. She will then have an advantage in establishing a nest in the following spring.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nIn order for the ''Vespula vulgaris'' queen to dominate all the workers \u2013 usually numbering more than 3000 in a colony  \u2013she possesses a special chemical that sends signals of dominance. The workers were discovered to regularly lick the queen while feeding her, and the air-borne [[pheromone]] from the queen's body alerts those workers of her dominance.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Pest status==\nAlong with the German wasp and two species of ''[[Polistes]]'' (all [[invasive species]]), the common wasp is considered a pest species in New Zealand, as it competes with [[Endemism|endemic]] species for food, such as insects and [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://www.envbop.govt.nz/Factsheets/PestAnimal-090526-PA03.pdf |date=November 2004 |publisher=[[Environment Bay of Plenty]] |title=Wasps |work=Pest Animal Control}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The vulgar wasp: the story of a ruthless invader and ingenious predator |last=Lester, Phil, 1969-|isbn=9781776561858 |location=Wellington |oclc=1031341683|date = April 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" /> In some [[South Island]] beech forests it is thought that densities of wasps are higher than anywhere else in the world.<ref name=doc>{{cite web |title=Vespula Wasp Factsheet |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803073040/http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 August 2012 |publisher=Department of Conservation |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> It is calculated that the total weight of common wasps in these places may exceed that of all birds.<ref name=TeAra>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Story: Wasps and bees |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wasps-and-bees/3 |encyclopedia=Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" />\n\nResearch indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |pmid=16158272 |year=2005 |last1=Steinmetz |first1=I |last2=Schmolz |first2=E |title=Nest odor dynamics in the social wasp Vespula vulgaris |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=414\u20138 |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0006-9 |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|bibcode=2005NW.....92..414S}}</ref> ''V. vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with honey bees for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island [[black beech]] forests.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite journal |last=Markwell |first=T.
