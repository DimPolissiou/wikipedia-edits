The current Lord Mayor of Liverpool is the Right Worshipful Councillor Anna Rothery who has held the post since September 2019. \n\nThe most prominent Mayors were the Stanleys of Knowsley, of which Sir Thomas Stanley (son of the 3rd Earl) and the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 16th and 18th [[Earls of Derby]] have held this office since ancient times.  The Molyneuxs of Sefton have also held this office on numerous occasions over the centuries: Sir Richard Molyneux, his grandson Sir Richard Molyneux Baronet, the 1st Viscount Molyneux and the 7th [[Earl of Sefton]].\n\nWhen Liverpool was granted city status in 1880 it was deemed necessary for the \"second city of the Empire\" to have a Lord Mayor. The city was granted a Lord Mayoralty on 3 August 1893 through letters patent making it the equal third oldest office of this kind in England along with Manchester.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} and [[Robert Durning Holt]] became the first Lord Mayor of Liverpool.<ref>Annual report and bulletin of the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool \u2013 Volumes 5\u20136 \u2013 Page 16 Walker Art Gallery \u2013 1975 \"He was the last Mayor and first Lord Mayor of Liverpool 1892-3. A son of George Holt (1790\u20131861), cotton broker, who founded the family fortunes\"</ref>\n\nFor a substantial period of time the Lord Mayor of Liverpool used the prefix of \"[[The Right Honourable]]\" as did the [[Lord Mayor of London]].  Sir [[Albert Woods]], [[Garter Principal King of Arms]] was of the opinion that this honorific should be enabled, due to the importance of Liverpool as a city second only to London.  When Sir [[Alfred Scott-Gatty]] succeeded as King of Arms, he expressed the view that his predecessor had made an error.  This changed nothing, however, and the city continued to use the prefix up until a Parliamentary statement in 1927.  From then on the Lord Mayor was styled \"[[The Right Worshipful]]\".\n\nWilliam Wallace Currie was the first \"Mayor of Liverpool\" under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].<ref>Gomer Williams ''History of the Liverpool \u2013 Privateers and Letters of Marque'' 2004 Page 572 \"... Dr. James Currie, a native of Annandale, and father of William Wallace Currie, who became first Mayor of Liverpool, under the Municipal Corporations Bill.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1983, the Labour controlled Council replaced the office of Lord Mayor with that of Chairman. The Lord Mayoralty was formally restored in 1990.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.liverpoolcityhalls.co.uk/media/1093/former-mayors-and-lord-mayors.pdf |title=List of Lord Mayors of Liverpool |accessdate= 13 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional office of the Lord Mayor of Liverpool differs from that of the new directly elected [[Directly elected mayor of Liverpool|Mayor of Liverpool]], an executive position created in 2012 when the functions of the former Lord Mayor were divided.

The current Lord Mayor of Liverpool is the Right Worshipful Councillor Anna Rothery who has held the post since September 2019. \n\nThe most prominent Mayors were the Stanleys of Knowsley, of which Sir Thomas Stanley (son of the 3rd Earl) and the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 16th and 18th [[Earls of Derby]] have held this office since ancient times.  The Molyneuxs of Sefton have also held this office on numerous occasions over the centuries: Sir Richard Molyneux, his grandson Sir Richard Molyneux Baronet, the 1st Viscount Molyneux and the 7th [[Earl of Sefton]].\n\nWhen Liverpool was granted city status in 1880 it was deemed necessary for the \"second city of the Empire\" to have a Lord Mayor. The city was granted a Lord Mayoralty on 3 August 1893 through letters patent making it the equal third oldest office of this kind in England along with Manchester.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} and [[Robert Durning Holt]] became the first Lord Mayor of Liverpool.<ref>Annual report and bulletin of the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool \u2013 Volumes 5\u20136 \u2013 Page 16 Walker Art Gallery \u2013 1975 \"He was the last Mayor and first Lord Mayor of Liverpool 1892-3. A son of George Holt (1790\u20131861), cotton broker, who founded the family fortunes\"</ref>\n\nFor a substantial period of time the Lord Mayor of Liverpool used the prefix of \"[[The Right Honourable]]\" as did the [[Lord Mayor of London]].  Sir [[Albert Woods]], [[Garter Principal King of Arms]] was of the opinion that this honorific should be enabled, due to the importance of Liverpool as a city second only to London.  When Sir [[Alfred Scott-Gatty]] succeeded as King of Arms, he expressed the view that his predecessor had made an error.  This changed nothing, however, and the city continued to use the prefix up until a Parliamentary statement in 1927.  From then on the Lord Mayor was styled \"[[The Right Worshipful]]\".\n\nWilliam Wallace Currie was the first \"Mayor of Liverpool\" under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].<ref>Gomer Williams ''History of the Liverpool \u2013 Privateers and Letters of Marque'' 2004 Page 572 \"... Dr. James Currie, a native of Annandale, and father of William Wallace Currie, who became first Mayor of Liverpool, under the Municipal Corporations Bill.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1983, the Labour controlled Council replaced the office of Lord Mayor with that of Chairman. The Lord Mayoralty was formally restored in 1990.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.liverpoolcityhalls.co.uk/media/1093/former-mayors-and-lord-mayors.pdf |title=List of Lord Mayors of Liverpool |accessdate= 13 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional office of the Lord Mayor of Liverpool differs from that of the new directly elected [[Directly elected mayor of Liverpool|Mayor of Liverpool]], an executive position created in 2012 when the functions of the former Lord Mayor were divided. The Lord Mayor's role is now primarily ceremonial in order to represent the city at civic functions and engagements, promote the city nationally and internationally and support local charities and community groups.\n\n== Mayors of the Borough of Liverpool (1207\u20131880) ==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-3}}\n* 1207\u201391 Unknown\n* 1292 John De More\n* 1293 John De More\n* 1294\u20131308 Unknown\n* 1309 John De More\n* 1337 Roger De More\n* 1338 Adam of Liverpool\n* 1339 Roger De More\n* 1340 Adam of Liverpool\n* 1341 Roger De More\n* 1342 Adam of Liverpool\n* 1343 Roger De More\n* 1344 Adam of Liverpool\n* 1345 Roger De More\n* 1346 Adam of Liverpool\n* 1347 Roger De More\n* 1348 Adam of Liverpool\n* 1349 Roger De More\n* 1350 Adam of Liverpool\n* 1351 William, Son of Adam\n* 1352 Unknown\n* 1353 William De Grenof\n* 1356 William, Son of Adam\n* 1358 William, Son of Adam\n* 1361 William, Son of Adam\n* 1369 William, Son of Adam\n* 1373 John de Hull\n* 1375\u201377 Richard de Aynesargh\n* 1379 William, Son of Adam de Liverpool\n* 1382 Richard de Aynesargh\n* 1382\u201388 Thomas de La More\n* 1396\u201397 Thomas de La More\n* 1401 Robert De Derby\n* 1416 Henry De Moysok\n* 1425 Thurston De Holcroft\n* 1428 John De Fasakerly\n* 1448 William Gaythirde\n* 1454William Gaythirde\n* 1462 Gilbert Mercer\n* 1474 John Davinport\n* 1476 John Crosse\n* 1477\u20131539 Unknown\n* 1540\u201341 Thomas Hughton\n* 1541\u201342 Sir Richard Molyneux (Grandfather of the 1st Baronet)\n* 1542\u201350 Unknown\n* 1550\u201351 Ralph Sekerton\n* 1551\u201352 Thomas More\n* 1552\u201353 Ralph Balie\n* 1553\u201354 Roger Walker\n* 1554\u201355 Sir William Norres\n* 1555\u201356 Thomas More\n* 1556\u201357 John More\n* 1557\u201358 Thomas More\n* 1558\u201359 Robert Corbet\n* 1559\u201360 Alexander Garret\n* 1560\u201361 Ralph Sekerton\n* 1561\u201362 Robert Corbet\n* 1562\u201363 Alexander Garret\n* 1563\u201364 Robert Corbet\n* 1564\u201365 Alexander Garret\n* 1565\u201366 John Crosse\n* 1566\u201367 Robert Corbet\n* 1567\u201368 William Secum\n* 1568\u201369 [[Sir Thomas Stanley]] K.G.
