As this contained both [[strychnine]] and [[arsenic]], she was required to sign the poison register. \n\nBritland's first victim was her eldest daughter, 19-year-old Elizabeth Hannah, in March 1886. Elizabeth's death was attributed to natural causes by the doctor who was called to attend the teenager. Mary Ann Britland then claimed [[\u00a3]]10 on Elizabeth's [[life insurance]] policy. Her next victim was her husband, Thomas, aged 44. His death on 3 May was diagnosed as [[epilepsy]], and once again Mary Ann claimed on the insurance.<ref name=\"Capital Punishment UK\">{{cite web |title=Mary Ann Britland |url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/Britland.html |website=Capital Punishment UK |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nMary Ann had been having an affair with her neighbour, Thomas Dixon, and after her own husband's death was invited to stay at the Dixons' house just across the street at number 128 by Thomas's 29-year-old wife, Mary. On 14 May, Mary Dixon was to become Britland's third and final victim.\n\n==Trial and sentencing==\nThe three deaths, all with their near identical and somewhat unusual symptoms, raised suspicion; Mary Ann Britland was finally interviewed by the police in connection with Mary Dixon's death and her body was examined by a pathologist. It was found to contain a lethal quantity of the two poisons and Britland was immediately arrested along with Thomas Dixon. She confessed to Ashton Police that she had wanted to marry Dixon and that she had first poisoned her daughter, Elizabeth, because she believed that she suspected her intentions. She then killed her husband, and finally Mary Dixon. \n\nBritland was charged with the murder of the three victims, but Thomas Dixon was found to have played no part in the murder of his wife.

As this contained both [[strychnine]] and [[arsenic]], she was required to sign the poison register. \n\nBritland's first victim was her eldest daughter, 19-year-old Elizabeth Hannah, in March 1886. Elizabeth's death was attributed to natural causes by the doctor who was called to attend the teenager. Mary Ann Britland then claimed [[\u00a3]]10 on Elizabeth's [[life insurance]] policy. Her next victim was her husband, Thomas, aged 44. His death on 3 May was diagnosed as [[epilepsy]], and once again Mary Ann claimed on the insurance.<ref name=\"Capital Punishment UK\">{{cite web |title=Mary Ann Britland |url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/Britland.html |website=Capital Punishment UK |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nMary Ann had been having an affair with her neighbour, Thomas Dixon, and after her own husband's death was invited to stay at the Dixons' house just across the street at number 128 by Thomas's 29-year-old wife, Mary. On 14 May, Mary Dixon was to become Britland's third and final victim.\n\n==Trial and sentencing==\nThe three deaths, all with their near identical and somewhat unusual symptoms, raised suspicion; Mary Ann Britland was finally interviewed by the police in connection with Mary Dixon's death and her body was examined by a pathologist. It was found to contain a lethal quantity of the two poisons and Britland was immediately arrested along with Thomas Dixon. She confessed to Ashton Police that she had wanted to marry Dixon and that she had first poisoned her daughter, Elizabeth, because she believed that she suspected her intentions. She then killed her husband, and finally Mary Dixon. \n\nBritland was charged with the murder of the three victims, but Thomas Dixon was found to have played no part in the murder of his wife. Britland came to trial on 22 July 1886, before Mr. Justice Cave at [[Manchester Assize Courts|Manchester Assizes]].<ref>Home Office: Calendar of Prisoners; HO 140 piece 89; [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C9004 National Archives]; ''Britland Mary Ann, 3 victims, 22 July 1866, Manchester, Lancashire</ref>  Since there was an absence of motive, in her defence she argued that the small sum of money from the insurance payouts were in no way compensation for the loss of her husband and daughter.

After a scoreless first quarter the Blazers took a two touchdown lead into the half. After the Blazers added a field goal early in the third quarter, they would not score again in regulation. Charlotte would do all the scoring left in regulation and tie the Blazers, forcing the 49ers' first overtime of the year. In the overtime period the Blazers would find the endzone first but the 49ers would match them. Seeking to get the program's first win of a frustrating year, Coach Lambert would go for two for the win; and after running in the matching touchdown Quarterback Hasaan Klugh would get the call again as he hauled in the game winning pass from Chris Montgomery to give the Niners' program its only win of the season and first ever Homecoming victory.\n\nTop performers of the game were UAB Quarterback A. J. Erdely, who passed for 182 yards and a touchdown. Charlotte Quarterback Hasaan Klugh would be the team's top rusher with 25 carries for 1449ers yards and two touchdowns.
