Although he achieved popular success and fortune during his lifetime, Fitzgerald did not receive much critical acclaim until after his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/22/big-ritz|title=As Big as the Ritz: The Mythology of the Fitzgeralds|website=The New Yorker|access-date=October 1, 2018}}</ref> He published four novels, four collections of short stories, as well as 164 short stories in magazines during his lifetime. Fitzgerald is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.\n\nFitzgerald was born into an upper-middle-class family in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], but was primarily raised in [[New York state|New York]]. He attended [[Princeton University]], but due to a failed relationship and a preoccupation with writing, he left Princeton in 1917 to join the [[United States Army|army]]. While stationed in [[Alabama]], he fell in love with rich socialite [[Zelda Sayre]]. Although she initially rejected him due to his financial situation, Zelda married Fitzgerald after he had published ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'' (1920). \n\nIn the 1920s, Fitzgerald  frequented Europe, where his writing was influenced by the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the \"[[Lost Generation]]\" expatriate community. His second novel, ''[[The Beautiful and Damned]]'' (1922), propelled him into the [[New York City]] elite. To maintain his lifestyle during this time, he also wrote several stories for magazines. His third novel, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925), was inspired by his rise to fame and relationship with Zelda. Although it received mixed reviews, ''The Great Gatsby'' is now widely praised, with some even labeling it the \"[[Great American Novel]]\". While Zelda was placed at a mental institute for her [[schizophrenia]], Fitzgerald completed his final novel, ''[[Tender Is the Night]]'' (1934).\n\nFaced with financial difficulties due to the declining popularity of his works, Fitzgerald began working in [[Hollywood]], writing and revising screenplays. After a long struggle with alcoholism, he died in 1940, at the age of 44. A fifth, unfinished novel, ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' (1941), was completed by [[Edmund Wilson]] and published after Fitzgerald's death. \n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\n[[File:F Scott Fitzgerald and his mother St Paul Minnesota.jpg|thumb|Fitzgerald as a child in Minnesota]]\nBorn in 1896 in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], to an upper-middle-class family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, three times removed on his father's side, [[Francis Scott Key]],<ref>Matthew Joseph Bruccoli and Scottie Fitzgerald Smith, ''Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F.

Like most professional authors at the time, Fitzgerald supplemented his income by writing short stories for such magazines as ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'', and ''[[Esquire magazine|Esquire]]'', and sold his stories and novels to Hollywood studios. This \"whoring\", as Fitzgerald and, subsequently, Hemingway called these sales,<ref name=MoveableFeast1/> was a sore point in the two authors' friendship.

The book went through many versions, the first of which was to be a story of [[matricide]].  Some critics have seen the book as a thinly veiled [[autobiographical novel]] recounting Fitzgerald's problems with his wife, the corrosive effects of wealth and a decadent lifestyle, his own egoism and self-confidence, and his continuing [[alcoholism]]. Indeed, Fitzgerald was extremely protective of his \"material\" (i.e., their life together).  When Zelda wrote and sent to Scribner's her own fictional version of their lives in Europe, ''[[Save Me the Waltz]]'', Fitzgerald was angry and was able to make some changes prior to the novel's publication, and convince her doctors to keep her from writing any more about what he called his \"material\", which included their relationship. His book was finally published in 1934 as ''[[Tender Is the Night]]''. Critics who had waited nine years for the followup to ''The Great Gatsby'' had mixed opinions about the novel. Most were thrown off by its three-part structure and many felt that Fitzgerald had not lived up to their expectations.<ref>Donaldson, Scott, ed. Critical Essays on F.

He might have interpreted them and even guided them, as in their middle years they saw a different and nobler freedom threatened with destruction.\"\n\n===Adaptations and portrayals in film and theatre===\nFitzgerald's works have been adapted into films many times. One of the earliest Fitzgerald short stories was adapted into a 1921 silent film ''[[The Off-Shore Pirate]]''. His short story, ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (short story)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'', was the basis for a [[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|2008 film]]. ''Tender Is the Night'' was the subject of the [[Tender Is the Night (film)|eponymous 1962 film]], and made into a television miniseries in 1985. ''The Beautiful and Damned'' was filmed in [[The Beautiful and Damned (film)|1922]] and 2010. ''The Great Gatsby'' has been the basis for numerous films of the same name, spanning nearly 90 years: [[The Great Gatsby (1926 film)|1926]], [[The Great Gatsby (1949 film)|1949]], [[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|1974]], [[The Great Gatsby (2000 film)|2000]], and [[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|2013]] adaptations. In 1976, ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' was filmed by [[Elia Kazan]], with [[Robert de Niro]], [[Tony Curtis]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Jeanne Moreau]] and others.\n\nFitzgerald is often portrayed in works covering the \"[[Lost Generation]]\" community in France. Actors portraying Fitzgerald, [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]] appear in the play ''Villa America'' by British playwright [[Crispin Whittell]], which premiered at [[Williamstown Theatre Festival]] (2007).

[[Guy Pearce]] and [[Vanessa Kirby]] portray the couple in 2016's ''[[Genius (2016 film)|Genius]]''.\n\nHis relationships with Zelda and other women have also proved an enduring source for literature and film. A musical about the lives of Fitzgerald and wife [[Zelda Fitzgerald]] was composed by [[Frank Wildhorn]] titled ''[[Waiting For The Moon (musical)|Waiting for the Moon]]'', followed by ''Scott & Zelda: The Other Side Of Paradise''.  The musical follows their lives from when they first met, through Fitzgerald's career, their lives together (the good and bad), to both of their deaths.The Japanese [[Takarazuka Revue]] has also created a musical adaptation of Fitzgerald's life. The last years of Fitzgerald and his affair with [[Sheilah Graham]], the Hollywood gossip columnist, was the theme of the movie ''[[Beloved Infidel]]'' (1959) based on Graham's 1958 [[memoir]] by the same name.<ref name=\"Beloved1\"/> The film depicts Fitzgerald (played by [[Gregory Peck]]) during his final years as a Hollywood [[scenarist]] and his relationship with Ms. Graham (played by [[Deborah Kerr]]), with whom he had a years-long affair, while his wife, Zelda, was institutionalized. Another film, ''[[Last Call (2002 film)|Last Call]]'' (2002) ([[Jeremy Irons]] plays Fitzgerald) describes the relationship of Fitzgerald and [[Frances Kroll Ring]] ([[Neve Campbell]]) during his last two years of life. [[Amazon Prime]]'s 2015 television series ''[[Z: The Beginning of Everything]]'' recounts Fitzgerald's relationship with Zelda, as well as his writing career. It stars [[David Hoflin]] as Fitzgerald and [[Christina Ricci]] as Zelda. Others include the TV movies ''[[Zelda (film)|Zelda]]'' (1993, with [[Timothy Hutton]]), ''F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood'' (1976, with [[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]]), and ''[[F. Scott Fitzgerald and 'The Last of the Belles']]'' (1974, with [[Richard Chamberlain]]).\n\n===Impact===\nIn 2015, an editor of ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' discovered and published for the first time an 8,000-word manuscript, dated July 1939, of a Fitzgerald short story titled \"Temperature\".<ref name=StrandSummer2015>''The Strand Magazine'', \"Unpublished Story by F.

Although he achieved popular success and fortune during his lifetime, Fitzgerald did not receive much critical acclaim until after his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/22/big-ritz|title=As Big as the Ritz: The Mythology of the Fitzgeralds|website=The New Yorker|access-date=October 1, 2018}}</ref> He published four novels, four collections of short stories, as well as 164 short stories in magazines during his lifetime. Fitzgerald is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.\n\nFitzgerald was born into an upper-middle-class family in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], but was primarily raised in [[New York state|New York]]. He attended [[Princeton University]], but due to a failed relationship and a preoccupation with writing, he left Princeton in 1917 to join the [[United States Army|army]]. While stationed in [[Alabama]], he fell in love with rich socialite [[Zelda Sayre]]. Although she initially rejected him due to his financial situation, Zelda married Fitzgerald after he had published ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'' (1920). \n\nIn the 1920s, Fitzgerald  frequented Europe, where his writing was influenced by the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the \"[[Lost Generation]]\" expatriate community. His second novel, ''[[The Beautiful and Damned]]'' (1922), propelled him into the [[New York City]] elite. To maintain his lifestyle during this time, he also wrote several stories for magazines. His third novel, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925), was inspired by his rise to fame and relationship with Zelda. Although it received mixed reviews, ''The Great Gatsby'' is now widely praised, with some even labeling it the \"[[Great American Novel]]\". While Zelda was placed at a mental institute for her [[schizophrenia]], Fitzgerald completed his final novel, ''[[Tender Is the Night]]'' (1934).\n\nFaced with financial difficulties due to the declining popularity of his works, Fitzgerald began working in [[Hollywood]], writing and revising screenplays. After a long struggle with alcoholism, he died in 1940, at the age of 44. A fifth, unfinished novel, ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' (1941), was completed by [[Edmund Wilson]] and published after Fitzgerald's death. \n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\n[[File:F Scott Fitzgerald and his mother St Paul Minnesota.jpg|thumb|Fitzgerald as a child in Minnesota]]\nBorn in 1896 in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], to an upper-middle-class family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, three times removed on his father's side, [[Francis Scott Key]],<ref>Matthew Joseph Bruccoli and Scottie Fitzgerald Smith, ''Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F.

During this period Fitzgerald became friends with many members of the American expatriate community in Paris, including a relatively unknown [[Ernest Hemingway]], whom Fitzgerald greatly admired.<ref name=\"life_of_fitzgerald\"/> Fitzgerald's friendship with Hemingway was quite effusive, as many of Fitzgerald's relationships would prove to be.

This \"whoring\", as Fitzgerald and, subsequently, Hemingway called these sales,<ref name=MoveableFeast1/> was a sore point in the two authors' friendship.

The book went through many versions, the first of which was to be a story of [[matricide]].  Some critics have seen the book as a thinly veiled [[autobiographical novel]] recounting Fitzgerald's problems with his wife, the corrosive effects of wealth and a decadent lifestyle, his own egoism and self-confidence, and his continuing [[alcoholism]]. Indeed, Fitzgerald was extremely protective of his \"material\" (i.e., their life together).  When Zelda wrote and sent to Scribner's her own fictional version of their lives in Europe, ''[[Save Me the Waltz]]'', Fitzgerald was angry and was able to make some changes prior to the novel's publication, and convince her doctors to keep her from writing any more about what he called his \"material\", which included their relationship. His book was finally published in 1934 as ''[[Tender Is the Night]]''. Critics who had waited nine years for the followup to ''The Great Gatsby'' had mixed opinions about the novel. Most were thrown off by its three-part structure and many felt that Fitzgerald had not lived up to their expectations.<ref>Donaldson, Scott, ed. Critical Essays on F.

Considine Jr., to temporarily relocate to Hollywood in order to write a flapper comedy for [[United Artists]]. Scott and Zelda moved into a studio-owned bungalow in January of the following year and Fitzgerald soon met and began an affair with [[Lois Moran]]. The starlet became a temporary muse for the author and he rewrote Rosemary Hoyt, one of the central characters in ''Tender is the Night''\u2014who had been a male in earlier drafts\u2014to closely mirror her.

[[Sheilah Graham]] was born to Jewish parents from Ukraine. According to Graham, he also enjoyed [[jewish deli|Jewish delicatessens]], where he would order [[knish|knishes]].  During the last two years of his life, he had a Jewish assistant and secretary, [[Frances Kroll Ring]].<ref name=\"jew\"/> \n\nIn 1947, [[Milton Hindus]], an assistant humanities professor at the [[University of Chicago]], published an article on ''The Great Gatsby'' which claimed: \"The novel reads very much like an anti-Semitic document.\"<ref>https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/milton-hindus/f-scott-fitzgerald-and-literary-anti-semitisma-footnote-on-the-mind-of-the-20s/</ref> However, [[James West]], a professor at [[Pennsylvania State University]], explained \"These slurs are not spoken in Fitzgerald's authorial voice. It's the characters who are antisemitic, not Fitzgerald.\"<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/01/f-scott-fitzgerald-stories-uncensored-sexual-innuendo-drug</ref>\n\n==Influence and legacy==\n[[File:Montgomery December 2018 86 (F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum).jpg|300px|thumb|The F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum in Montgomery, Alabama]]\nFitzgerald's work has inspired writers ever since he was first published.<ref>''The Golden Moment: The Novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald''. [[Milton R. Stern|MR Stern]]. 1970. [[University of Illinois]] Press.</ref> The publication of ''The Great Gatsby'' prompted [[T. S. Eliot]] to write, in a letter to Fitzgerald, \"It seems to me to be the first step that American fiction has taken since [[Henry James]]&nbsp;...\"<ref>Fitzgerald, F. Scott. \"The Crack-Up\". A New Directions Book, edited by Edmund Wilson. New York, 1993, p. 310.</ref> Don Birnam, the protagonist of [[Charles R.

''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''. April 19, 1981.</ref> It was written in an editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' after his death that Fitzgerald \"was better than he knew, for in fact and in the literary sense he invented a generation&nbsp;... He might have interpreted them and even guided them, as in their middle years they saw a different and nobler freedom threatened with destruction.\"\n\n===Adaptations and portrayals in film and theatre===\nFitzgerald's works have been adapted into films many times. One of the earliest Fitzgerald short stories was adapted into a 1921 silent film ''[[The Off-Shore Pirate]]''. His short story, ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (short story)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'', was the basis for a [[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|2008 film]]. ''Tender Is the Night'' was the subject of the [[Tender Is the Night (film)|eponymous 1962 film]], and made into a television miniseries in 1985. ''The Beautiful and Damned'' was filmed in [[The Beautiful and Damned (film)|1922]] and 2010. ''The Great Gatsby'' has been the basis for numerous films of the same name, spanning nearly 90 years: [[The Great Gatsby (1926 film)|1926]], [[The Great Gatsby (1949 film)|1949]], [[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|1974]], [[The Great Gatsby (2000 film)|2000]], and [[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|2013]] adaptations. In 1976, ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' was filmed by [[Elia Kazan]], with [[Robert de Niro]], [[Tony Curtis]], [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Jeanne Moreau]] and others.\n\nFitzgerald is often portrayed in works covering the \"[[Lost Generation]]\" community in France. Actors portraying Fitzgerald, [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]] appear in the play ''Villa America'' by British playwright [[Crispin Whittell]], which premiered at [[Williamstown Theatre Festival]] (2007). Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald appear alongside Ernest Hemingway, [[Hadley Hemingway]], [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Ezra Pound]] in the novel ''The Paris Wife'' by Paula McLain.<ref name=\"Paris Wife\">[http://www.randomhouse.com/rhpg/features/paula_mclain/ ''The Paris Wife'' by Paula McLain]</ref> The novel was adapted by Sheila Yeger for a 2011 BBC Radio 4 ''[[Woman's Hour Drama]]''.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zdbj5 This radio adaptation of ''The Paris Wife''] featured the actor [http://www.gerardcooke.com/ Gerard Cooke] as F. Scott Fitzgerald.</ref> [[Tom Hiddleston]] and [[Alison Pill]] appear briefly as Fitzgerald and Zelda in [[Woody Allen]]'s 2011 feature film ''[[Midnight in Paris]]''. [[Guy Pearce]] and [[Vanessa Kirby]] portray the couple in 2016's ''[[Genius (2016 film)|Genius]]''.\n\nHis relationships with Zelda and other women have also proved an enduring source for literature and film. A musical about the lives of Fitzgerald and wife [[Zelda Fitzgerald]] was composed by [[Frank Wildhorn]] titled ''[[Waiting For The Moon (musical)|Waiting for the Moon]]'', followed by ''Scott & Zelda: The Other Side Of Paradise''.  The musical follows their lives from when they first met, through Fitzgerald's career, their lives together (the good and bad), to both of their deaths.The Japanese [[Takarazuka Revue]] has also created a musical adaptation of Fitzgerald's life. The last years of Fitzgerald and his affair with [[Sheilah Graham]], the Hollywood gossip columnist, was the theme of the movie ''[[Beloved Infidel]]'' (1959) based on Graham's 1958 [[memoir]] by the same name.<ref name=\"Beloved1\"/> The film depicts Fitzgerald (played by [[Gregory Peck]]) during his final years as a Hollywood [[scenarist]] and his relationship with Ms. Graham (played by [[Deborah Kerr]]), with whom he had a years-long affair, while his wife, Zelda, was institutionalized. Another film, ''[[Last Call (2002 film)|Last Call]]'' (2002) ([[Jeremy Irons]] plays Fitzgerald) describes the relationship of Fitzgerald and [[Frances Kroll Ring]] ([[Neve Campbell]]) during his last two years of life. [[Amazon Prime]]'s 2015 television series ''[[Z: The Beginning of Everything]]'' recounts Fitzgerald's relationship with Zelda, as well as his writing career. It stars [[David Hoflin]] as Fitzgerald and [[Christina Ricci]] as Zelda. Others include the TV movies ''[[Zelda (film)|Zelda]]'' (1993, with [[Timothy Hutton]]), ''F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood'' (1976, with [[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]]), and ''[[F. Scott Fitzgerald and 'The Last of the Belles']]'' (1974, with [[Richard Chamberlain]]).\n\n===Impact===\nIn 2015, an editor of ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' discovered and published for the first time an 8,000-word manuscript, dated July 1939, of a Fitzgerald short story titled \"Temperature\".<ref name=StrandSummer2015>''The Strand Magazine'', \"Unpublished Story by F.

Harkin noted that many chlorine attacks launched by Syrian forces in the past had resulted in no casualties, hypothesizing that\u2014in contrast to the much more lethal sarin gas\u2014Syrian forces likely employed chlorine at Douma to induce panic among the population rather than to kill many people. One of the canisters never released its payload and caused no deaths, but the other canister struck the weak roof of an apartment complex at an unexpected angle, releasing a very high concentration of chlorine that killed the people beneath it in a matter of minutes. According to Harkin, the frightened residents seen flocking to a nearby hospital and being doused with water in viral footage were not survivors of the chemical attack, but victims of conventional weapons and smoke inhalation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harkin|first=James|url=https://theintercept.com/2019/02/09/douma-chemical-attack-evidence-syria/|title=What Happened in Douma?

Harkin noted that many chlorine attacks launched by Syrian forces in the past had resulted in no casualties, hypothesizing that\u2014in contrast to the much more lethal sarin gas\u2014Syrian forces likely employed chlorine at Douma to induce panic among the population rather than to kill many people. One of the canisters never released its payload and caused no deaths, but the other canister struck the weak roof of an apartment complex at an unexpected angle, releasing a very high concentration of chlorine that killed the people beneath it in a matter of minutes. According to Harkin, the frightened residents seen flocking to a nearby hospital and being doused with water in viral footage were not survivors of the chemical attack, but victims of conventional weapons and smoke inhalation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harkin|first=James|url=https://theintercept.com/2019/02/09/douma-chemical-attack-evidence-syria/|title=What Happened in Douma?

The release provided two notable feature improvements; firstly NT 3.51 was the first of a short-lived outing of [[Microsoft Windows]] on the [[PowerPC]] [[Instruction set architecture|architecture]]. The second most significant enhancement offered through the release was that it provides [[client/server]] support for inter-operating with [[Windows 95]], which was released three months after NT 3.51.

But after Checkers' head coach [[Fred Creighton]] did not return any calls and the season soon approaching, Hanson was starting to question his options.

In the meantime, team owner Mike McClure (who Hanson knew from his time with the WHA Birmingham Bulls) contacted Hanson and inquired if he would be interested in coaching his new ACHL franchise. Hanson said that \"he was looking to get into coaching\" and former Bulls' coach [[Glen Sonmor]] said that Carlson \"had a good character for it.\" <ref name=\"Bulls\" /> On September 12, 1983, Hanson was announced as the Bulls' head coach.<ref name=\"Hanson\">{{cite book |last= Hanson|first= Dave |author-link= |date= April 8, 2020 |title= Slap Shot Original: The Man, the Foil, and the Legend |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9SNQAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA163&lpg=PA163&dq=Birmingham+Bulls+ACHL+1983&source=bl&ots=dx_znTZ-ij&sig=ACfU3U3hAJfBW82ghVZbd7Yad_JRUoh6-w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjEgrKtm9roAhXbknIEHcgSAts4ChDoATAJegQICxAo#v=onepage&q=Birmingham%20Bulls%20ACHL%201983&f=false|location= |publisher= Triumph Books |page=163-165 |isbn=978-1-60078-875-8}}</ref>\n\n==Eviction and folding==\nOn [[October 14]], while the team was playing their first preseason game in Nashville, they were evicted from the Birmingham Jefferson Convention Complex as a result of being unable to pay the $50,000 rental fee they owed.

It elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election and one Assembly Member by the [[first past the post]] system of election.\n\n== History ==\nThe constituency is located in the preserved county of [[West Glamorgan]], [[Wales]].  It consists of the electoral wards of: [[Aberdulais]], [[Alltwen|Allt-wen]], [[Blaengwrach]], [[Bryncoch North|Bryn-c\u00f4ch North]], [[Bryncoch South|Bryn-c\u00f4ch South]], [[Cadoxton (electoral ward)|Cadoxton]], [[Cimla]], [[Crynant]], [[Cwmllynfell]], [[Dyffryn Clydach|Dyffryn]], [[Glynneath (electoral ward)|Glynneath]], [[Godre'r Graig]], [[Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen (electoral ward)|Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen]], [[Lower Brynamman]], [[Neath East]], [[Neath North]], [[Neath South]], [[Onllwyn]], [[Pelenna]], [[Pontardawe]], [[Resolven]], [[Rhos, Neath Port Talbot|Rhos]], [[Seven Sisters (electoral ward)|Seven Sisters]], [[Tonna, Neath|Tonna]], [[Trebanos (electoral ward)|Trebanos]], [[Ystalyfera]].\n\nThe Neath constituency is a mixture of both industrial and rural communities, running in a north-south strip along the dips, ridges and folded landscape of [[South Wales]]. It includes most of the Neath and Dulais valleys, and some of the Upper Swansea Valley as well. The town of [[Neath]] is at its southern end and is a medium-sized town which started life as a Roman Nidum.\n\nThe constituency boasts historical places of both industrial and natural forms. Neath and the surrounding areas were industrialised very early in Britain's history. Copper smelting was already happening here in the late sixteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nWhen [[Neath Abbey]] (now a magnificent ruin) was founded in 1129, it was the richest of all Welsh monasteries, and in writings of the sixteenth century was described as the 'fairest Abbey of all Wales'. At its height it owned extensive lands and property, from Glamorgan to Somerset; had almost 5,000 sheep, as well as horses and cattle; it owned a ship and a landing-place, and worked mills, fisheries and coal-mines. But it suffered greatly during the many skirmishes between the Welsh and English (or Normans), and by the 1530s had only eight monks left. The ruins date mostly from the late thirteenth century. It has been in turn, a prosperous Abbey, a Jacobean Mansion (painted by Turner), an iron foundry (which explains the Abbey's position in the middle of an industrial area) and now an historical monument.\n\nThe constituency was heavily mined and the small communities that grew up around these mines were devastated by the collapse of the mining industry in the 1980s. On the edges of many of these communities there are now \"Industrial Villages\" springing up, helping to replace the jobs lost by the demise of the mining industry, and so helping to keep young people in these communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npt.gov.uk/|title=Neath Port Talbot Council|website=www.npt.gov.uk}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2011}}\n\nA legacy to Neath's political history is the memorial stone in Victoria Gardens to the 5 Neath citizens killed during the Spanish Civil War of 1936\u201338.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe constituency remains a [[Welsh language|Welsh-speaking]] area, with approximately 26% of the population reported as Welsh speakers. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref name=\"rayment\">{{Rayment-hc|n|1|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n!Party\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Coalition Liberal/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n| [[John Hugh Edwards]]\n| [[Coalition Liberal]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]\n| [[William Jenkins (Labour politician)|Sir William Jenkins]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1945 Neath by-election|1945 by-election]]\n| [[D.

It elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election and one Assembly Member by the [[first past the post]] system of election.\n\n== History ==\nThe constituency is located in the preserved county of [[West Glamorgan]], [[Wales]].  It consists of the electoral wards of: [[Aberdulais]], [[Alltwen|Allt-wen]], [[Blaengwrach]], [[Bryncoch North|Bryn-c\u00f4ch North]], [[Bryncoch South|Bryn-c\u00f4ch South]], [[Cadoxton (electoral ward)|Cadoxton]], [[Cimla]], [[Crynant]], [[Cwmllynfell]], [[Dyffryn Clydach|Dyffryn]], [[Glynneath (electoral ward)|Glynneath]], [[Godre'r Graig]], [[Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen (electoral ward)|Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen]], [[Lower Brynamman]], [[Neath East]], [[Neath North]], [[Neath South]], [[Onllwyn]], [[Pelenna]], [[Pontardawe]], [[Resolven]], [[Rhos, Neath Port Talbot|Rhos]], [[Seven Sisters (electoral ward)|Seven Sisters]], [[Tonna, Neath|Tonna]], [[Trebanos (electoral ward)|Trebanos]], [[Ystalyfera]].\n\nThe Neath constituency is a mixture of both industrial and rural communities, running in a north-south strip along the dips, ridges and folded landscape of [[South Wales]]. It includes most of the Neath and Dulais valleys, and some of the Upper Swansea Valley as well. The town of [[Neath]] is at its southern end and is a medium-sized town which started life as a Roman Nidum.\n\nThe constituency boasts historical places of both industrial and natural forms. Neath and the surrounding areas were industrialised very early in Britain's history. Copper smelting was already happening here in the late sixteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nWhen [[Neath Abbey]] (now a magnificent ruin) was founded in 1129, it was the richest of all Welsh monasteries, and in writings of the sixteenth century was described as the 'fairest Abbey of all Wales'. At its height it owned extensive lands and property, from Glamorgan to Somerset; had almost 5,000 sheep, as well as horses and cattle; it owned a ship and a landing-place, and worked mills, fisheries and coal-mines. But it suffered greatly during the many skirmishes between the Welsh and English (or Normans), and by the 1530s had only eight monks left. The ruins date mostly from the late thirteenth century. It has been in turn, a prosperous Abbey, a Jacobean Mansion (painted by Turner), an iron foundry (which explains the Abbey's position in the middle of an industrial area) and now an historical monument.\n\nThe constituency was heavily mined and the small communities that grew up around these mines were devastated by the collapse of the mining industry in the 1980s. On the edges of many of these communities there are now \"Industrial Villages\" springing up, helping to replace the jobs lost by the demise of the mining industry, and so helping to keep young people in these communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npt.gov.uk/|title=Neath Port Talbot Council|website=www.npt.gov.uk}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2011}}\n\nA legacy to Neath's political history is the memorial stone in Victoria Gardens to the 5 Neath citizens killed during the Spanish Civil War of 1936\u201338.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe constituency remains a [[Welsh language|Welsh-speaking]] area, with approximately 26% of the population reported as Welsh speakers. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref name=\"rayment\">{{Rayment-hc|n|1|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n!Party\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Coalition Liberal/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n| [[John Hugh Edwards]]\n| [[Coalition Liberal]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]\n| [[William Jenkins (Labour politician)|Sir William Jenkins]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1945 Neath by-election|1945 by-election]]\n| [[D.

For example, in 1898, [[Richard Strauss]] dedicated his tone poem ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' to Mengelberg and the Concertgebouw Orchestra, telling journalists that he \"had at last found an orchestra capable of playing all passages, so that he no longer needed to feel embarrassed when writing difficulties.\" Among other notable premieres were those on 29 March 1939, when Mengelberg conducted the premiere of the Violin Concerto no. 2 by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] with violinist [[Zolt\u00e1n Sz\u00e9kely]], and on 23 November 1939, he premiered the ''Peacock Variations'' of [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]].\n\nMengelberg founded the long-standing Mahler tradition of the Concertgebouw. He met and befriended [[Gustav Mahler]] in 1902, and invited Mahler to conduct his [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]] in Amsterdam in 1903, and on 23 October 1904 Mahler led the orchestra in his [[Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)|Fourth Symphony]] twice in one concert, with no other work on the program. Mahler wrote to his wife [[Alma Mahler]] that this programming idea (presumably Mengelberg's) was a \"stroke of genius.\"  Mahler regularly visited The Netherlands to introduce his work to Dutch audiences, including also his [[Symphony No. 1 (Mahler)|First]], [[Symphony No. 5 (Mahler)|Fifth]], and [[Symphony No. 7 (Mahler)|Seventh]] Symphonies, as well as [[Das Klagende Lied]] and [[Kindertotenlieder]]. Mahler edited some of his symphonies while rehearsing them with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, making them sound better for the [[acoustics]] of the Concertgebouw. This is perhaps one reason that this concert hall and its orchestra are renowned for their Mahler tradition. In 1920, Mengelberg instituted a Mahler Festival in which all the composer's music was performed in nine concerts.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last= Crichton | first=Ronald | title= Willem Mengelberg | work=New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians | year= 1980}}</ref>\n\nMengelberg also founded, in 1899, the annual Concertgebouw tradition of performing the [[St. Matthew Passion]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] on [[Palm Sunday]].\n\nOne criticism of Mengelberg's influence over Dutch musical life, most clearly articulated by the composer [[Willem Pijper]], was that Mengelberg did not particularly champion Dutch composers during his Concertgebouw tenure, especially after 1920.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hoogerwerf|first=Frank W.|date=July 1976|title=Willem Pijper as Dutch Nationalist|journal=The Musical Quarterly|volume= 62|issue= 3|pages=358\u2013373|url=|accessdate=|doi=10.1093/mq/LXII.3.358}}</ref>\n[[Image:W. Mengelberg.jpg|thumb|left|Mengelberg with ''The New York Times'']]\nMengelberg was music director of the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] from 1922 to 1928. Beginning in January 1926, he shared the podium with [[Arturo Toscanini]]; Toscanini biographer [[Harvey Sachs]] has documented that Mengelberg and Toscanini clashed over interpretations of music and even rehearsal techniques, creating division among the musicians that eventually resulted in Mengelberg leaving the orchestra. Mengelberg made a series of recordings with the Philharmonic for both the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and [[Brunswick Records]], including a 1928 electrical recording of Richard Strauss' ''Ein Heldenleben'' that was later reissued on LP and CD. One of his first electrical recordings, for Victor, was a two-disc set devoted to ''A Victory Ball'' by [[Ernest Schelling]].\n\nIn 1933, Mengelberg generated negative publicity in what was known as the \"Mengelberg Crisis\". Mengelberg had changed his residence to Switzerland to evade high tax rates in the country.<ref>{{cite book |title=Two Worlds of Music |last=Geissmar |first=Berta |publisher=Creative Age Press, Inc. |location=New York |date=1946}}</ref>{{rp|59}}\n\nMengelberg was described by [[Fred Goldbeck]] as \"the perfect dictator/conductor, a Napoleon of the orchestra\";<ref>notes to WILLEM MENGELBERG  Archives in\u00e9dites III, TAHRA TAH 420-421</ref> Alan Sanders writes, \"his treatment of the orchestra was autocratic.

His biographer Fritz Zwart writes (for Radio Nederland) of an \"interview Mengelberg had given with the ''V\u00f6lkische Beobachter'', the German Nazi newspaper...the gist of it was that, on hearing of the Dutch surrender to the German invaders on May 10, 1940, he had brought a toast with a glass of champagne [and] had also spoken about the close bond existing between the Netherlands and Germany.\" Zwart also notes that Mengelberg conducted in Germany and in German-occupied countries throughout the war, and was photographed in the company of Nazis such as [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]].<ref>Frits Zwart, \"Willem Mengelberg Live,\" notes to Q Disc box 97016</ref> \n[[File:MengelbergSeyssInquartJager1942.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Mengelberg (left) with [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart|Reichskommissar Seyss-Inquart]] (1942)]]\nExplanations have ranged from political naivet\u00e9 in general, to a general \"blind spot\" for criticism of anything German, given his own ancestry. After the war, in 1945, the Netherlands' Honour Council for Music banned him from conducting in the Netherlands for life; in 1947, after an appeal by his lawyers, the Council reduced his ban to six years, though also in 1947, Queen Wilhelmina withdrew his Gold Medal of Honor.<ref>Frits Zwart, \"Willem Mengelberg Live,\" notes to Q Disc box 97016</ref> This notwithstanding, he continued to draw a pension from the orchestra until 1949 when cut off by the city council of Amsterdam.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,799854,00.html|title=I Bow Humbly|work=Time|author=|date=28 February 1949|accessdate=1 June 2007}}</ref> Mengelberg retreated in exile to [[Zuort]], [[Sent]], Switzerland, where he remained until his death in 1951, just two months before the expiration of his exile order.\n\nWillem Mengelberg was the uncle of the musicologist and composer [[Rudolf Mengelberg]] and of the conductor, composer and critic [[Karel Mengelberg]], who was himself the father of the improvising pianist and composer [[Misha Mengelberg]].\n\n== Performance style ==\n[[File:MengelbergMerkelbach1919.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Mengelberg (1919)]]\nThe [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]] (1980) entry on Mengelberg describes him as a \"martinet addicted to meticulous and voluble rehearsals\";<ref>[[Yehudi Menuhin]] also commented on Mengelberg's verbosity in rehearsal (Yehudi Menuhin, ''Unfinished Journey'', 1977, p. 150)</ref> it also notes that he did not hesitate to make what he called ''changements'' to a composer's scores when he felt it would aid clarity.\n\nMengelberg's recordings with the Concertgebouw Orchestra are marked by frequent use of an unusually prominent [[portamento]], the sliding of the string players' left fingers from one note to another. The scholar Robert Philip has shown that Mengelberg's recordings with other orchestras do not show this portamento, and that \"the unusual approach to portamento... was a stylistic feature which he developed with [the Concertgebouw] over a long period of rehearsal, and that it was not a style which could be transferred to other orchestras when Mengelberg visited them\" <ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Philip |title=Early Recordings and Musical Style: Changing Tastes in Instrumental Performance, 1900-1950 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521235286 |year=1992 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/earlyrecordingsm00phil_0/page/197 197] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/earlyrecordingsm00phil_0/page/197 }}</ref> Philip also notes that this portamento required the strings to use uniform fingering prescribed by Mengelberg, and that this was also unusual for the time, when much orchestral fingering was typically \"free,\" with different players fingering a passage differently. Freely bowed portamento sounded lighter than that we hear in Mengelberg's recordings, as not all players would slide on the same notes. Philip mentions recordings by the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] under [[Bruno Walter]] as examples of this style.\n\nIn addition, Mengelberg employed fluctuations of tempo that were extreme even in an era in which tempo fluctuation was more common than in modern practice. While admirers of Mengelberg value his tempo inflections, detractors have criticized them. For example, the musicologist and music theorist Walter Frisch has argued that \"in the Brahms performances recorded by Willem Mengelberg, tempo fluctuation too often tends to obscure the broader shape of a passage or movement.\" Frisch argues that this obscuring of structure does not result from the tempo fluctuations of two conductors he admires who also used much tempo inflection, [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]] and [[Hermann Abendroth]]  <ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Michael|editor-last=Musgrave |editor2-first=Bernard | editor2-last=Sherman | title= In search of Brahms's First Symphony: Steinbach, the Meiningen tradition, and the recordings of Hermann Abendroth in |booktitle=Performing Brahms: Early Evidence of Performance Style |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521652731 |year=2003 |pages=245 }}</ref>\n\n== Recorded legacy ==\n\nMengelberg made commercial recordings in the United States with the New York Philharmonic for [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] (1922\u201330) and [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] (1926-27). In Amsterdam with the Concertgebouw Orchestra he made a series of records issued in various countries on the [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and [[Odeon Records|Odeon]] labels (1926\u201332) as well as two works recorded for the Dutch branch of [[Decca Records|Decca]] in 1935. Mengelberg recorded with the Concertgebouw Orchestra and the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] for [[Teldec|Telefunken]] (1937\u201342). After his death, [[Philips Records|Philips]] issued recordings of live performances recorded by Dutch radio services, and these have been reissued by Decca.\n\nIn addition to his recordings of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' and ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'', Mengelberg left discs of symphonies by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Peter Tchaikovski|Tchaikovski]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'', Gustav Mahler's [[Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 4]] and the Adagietto from [[Symphony No. 5 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 5]].\n\nHis most characteristic performances are marked by a tremendous expressiveness and freedom of tempo, perhaps most remarkable in his recording of Mahler's Fourth Symphony but certainly present in the aforementioned ''St Matthew Passion'' and other performances as well. These qualities, shared (perhaps to a lesser extent) by only a handful of other conductors of the era of sound recording, such as [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]] and [[Leonard Bernstein]], make much of his work unusually controversial among classical music listeners; recordings that more mainstream listeners consider unlistenable will be hailed by others as among the greatest recordings ever made.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nMany of his recorded performances, including some live concerts in Amsterdam during World War II, have been reissued on LP and CD. While he was known for his recordings of the German repertoire, [[Capitol Records]] issued a powerful, nearly high fidelity recording of [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s [[Symphony in D minor (Franck)|Symphony in D minor]], recorded in the 1940s by [[Telefunken]] with the Concertgebouw Orchestra.\n\nDue to the Dutch government's six-year ban on Mengelberg's conducting activities, he made no more recordings after 1945. Some of his performances in Amsterdam were recorded on the innovative German tape recorder, the [[Magnetophon]], resulting in unusually high fidelity for the time.\n\nSound films of Mengelberg conducting the Concertgebouw Orchestra, during live concerts in Amsterdam, have survived; among these are a 1931 performance of [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]'s ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]'' overture. His 1939 recording of Bach's ''St Matthew Passion,'' while not captured on film, was created on a Philips optical system which used film as the (audio-only) recording medium.<ref>[http://www.soundfountain.com/amb/phmil.html Willem MENGELBERG, Bach's St. MATTHEW/Matth\u00e4us Passion and The Philips Miller Optical Recording System<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Zwart, Frits, ''Conductor Willem Mengelberg, 1871-1951: Acclaimed and Accused'', Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2019.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Willem Mengelberg}}\n* [http://www.nederlandsmuziekinstituut.nl/en/archives/list-of-music-archives?task=listdetail&id=2_757 Willem Mengelberg Archives] at the Netherlands Music Institute\n* [http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Mengelberg-Willem.htm Willem Mengelberg] at the [[Bach Cantatas Website]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060317212855/http://classicalrecordings.org/mengelberg.html Listen to Mengelberg conduct and read his biography]\n* [http://web.kyoto-inet.or.jp/people/thase29/Willem2/Willem2.html Discography]\n* [http://www.soundfountain.com/amb/phmil.html Mengelberg's legendary recording of Bach's St. Matthew Passion]\n* [http://www.willem-mengelberg.com]\n\n{{Concertgebouworkest conductors}}\n{{NYPhil music directors}}\n{{LSO principal conductors}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mengelberg, Willem}}\n[[Category:1871 births]]\n[[Category:1951 deaths]]\n[[Category:Dutch conductors (music)]]\n[[Category:Male conductors (music)]]\n[[Category:Bach conductors]]\n[[Category:Dutch people of German descent]]\n[[Category:Honorary Members of the Royal Philharmonic Society]]\n[[Category:London Symphony Orchestra principal conductors]]\n[[Category:People from Utrecht (city)]]\n[[Category:Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra chief conductors]]\n[[Category:Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Tanz K\u00f6ln alumni]]\n[[Category:Music directors of the New York Philharmonic]]\n[[Category:Mengelberg family|Willem]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox person\n|name = Willem Mengelberg\n|image = WillemMengelberg1905.jpg\n|birth_name = {{nowrap|Joseph Willem Mengelberg}}\n|birth_date = 28 March 1871\n|birth_place =[[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], Netherlands\n|death_date = 21 March 1951 (aged 79)\n|death_place =[[Sent|Zuort, Sent]], Switzerland\n|occupation = [[conducting|Conductor]]\n|years_active = 1891\u20131945<!--1891 is explained: 2nd paragraph of the \"Biography\" section-->\n|module = {{Infobox musical artist|embed=yes\n  |background = non_performing_personnel\n  |genre = [[Classical music|Classical]]\n  |associated_acts = [[National Radio Orchestra of Romania]]<br />[[Concertgebouw]]<br />[[London Symphony Orchestra|London Symphony]]<br />[[New York Philharmonic]]\n  }}\n}}\n'''Joseph Willem Mengelberg''' (28 March 1871 \u2013 21 March 1951) was a Dutch [[conducting|conductor]], famous for his performances of [[Beethoven]], [[Brahms]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] and [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]] with the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra|Concertgebouw Orchestra]].\n\n== Biography ==\nMengelberg was the fourth of fifteen children of German-born parents in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], Netherlands.

These qualities, shared (perhaps to a lesser extent) by only a handful of other conductors of the era of sound recording, such as [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]] and [[Leonard Bernstein]], make much of his work unusually controversial among classical music listeners; recordings that more mainstream listeners consider unlistenable will be hailed by others as among the greatest recordings ever made.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nMany of his recorded performances, including some live concerts in Amsterdam during World War II, have been reissued on LP and CD. While he was known for his recordings of the German repertoire, [[Capitol Records]] issued a powerful, nearly high fidelity recording of [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s [[Symphony in D minor (Franck)|Symphony in D minor]], recorded in the 1940s by [[Telefunken]] with the Concertgebouw Orchestra.\n\nDue to the Dutch government's six-year ban on Mengelberg's conducting activities, he made no more recordings after 1945. Some of his performances in Amsterdam were recorded on the innovative German tape recorder, the [[Magnetophon]], resulting in unusually high fidelity for the time.\n\nSound films of Mengelberg conducting the Concertgebouw Orchestra, during live concerts in Amsterdam, have survived; among these are a 1931 performance of [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]'s ''[[Oberon (Weber)|Oberon]]'' overture. His 1939 recording of Bach's ''St Matthew Passion,'' while not captured on film, was created on a Philips optical system which used film as the (audio-only) recording medium.<ref>[http://www.soundfountain.com/amb/phmil.html Willem MENGELBERG, Bach's St. MATTHEW/Matth\u00e4us Passion and The Philips Miller Optical Recording System<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Zwart, Frits, ''Conductor Willem Mengelberg, 1871-1951: Acclaimed and Accused'', Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2019.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Willem Mengelberg}}\n* [http://www.nederlandsmuziekinstituut.nl/en/archives/list-of-music-archives?task=listdetail&id=2_757 Willem Mengelberg Archives] at the Netherlands Music Institute\n* [http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Bio/Mengelberg-Willem.htm Willem Mengelberg] at the [[Bach Cantatas Website]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060317212855/http://classicalrecordings.org/mengelberg.html Listen to Mengelberg conduct and read his biography]\n* [http://web.kyoto-inet.or.jp/people/thase29/Willem2/Willem2.html Discography]\n* [http://www.soundfountain.com/amb/phmil.html Mengelberg's legendary recording of Bach's St. Matthew Passion]\n* [http://www.willem-mengelberg.com]\n\n{{Concertgebouworkest conductors}}\n{{NYPhil music directors}}\n{{LSO principal conductors}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mengelberg, Willem}}\n[[Category:1871 births]]\n[[Category:1951 deaths]]\n[[Category:Dutch conductors (music)]]\n[[Category:Male conductors (music)]]\n[[Category:Bach conductors]]\n[[Category:Dutch people of German descent]]\n[[Category:Honorary Members of the Royal Philharmonic Society]]\n[[Category:London Symphony Orchestra principal conductors]]\n[[Category:People from Utrecht (city)]]\n[[Category:Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra chief conductors]]\n[[Category:Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Tanz K\u00f6ln alumni]]\n[[Category:Music directors of the New York Philharmonic]]\n[[Category:Mengelberg family|Willem]]\n", "name_user": "GiantSnowman", "label": "safe", "comment": "date formats perMOS:DATEFORMATbyscript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_Mengelberg"}

The airport is publicly owned.<ref name=FAA />\n\n==History==\nSimilar to other airfields established in Florida during [[World War II]], the approximate 1,025-acre airport was built by the [[United States Navy]] in 1943 (known then as Roseland Satellite Field or Outlying Field Roseland) in support of naval flight training operations at nearby [[Vero Beach Municipal Airport|Naval Air Station Vero Beach]] and [[Melbourne International Airport|Naval Air Station Melbourne]].  The military paid approximately $1,300 for the property in 1943.  Inactivated as a naval facility following the end of World War II, the aviation facility was transferred by the War Assets Administration, as part of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, on January 29, 1959, to the City of Sebastian.  Upon taking responsibility, a provision was written in reference to the Federal Surplus Property Act, that the airport would be used without unfair discrimination solely for aviation purposes.  This provision provided that the property be given back to the United States in the event of noncompliance with any terms and conditions of the deed.\n\nSince its acquisition in 1959, Sebastian Municipal Airport (now 620 acres) has been maintained and operated by the City of Sebastian.  Since the transfer of ownership from the U.S. Government, Sebastian Municipal Airport has undergone numerous facility changes and improvements.  The noted championship Sebastian Municipal Golf Course was built in 1981 on a 155-acre plot of land occupying a large portion of the airport property and local area flight training greatly increased operations at the airport in the mid to late 1980s.

The airport is publicly owned.<ref name=FAA />\n\n==History==\nSimilar to other airfields established in Florida during [[World War II]], the approximate 1,025-acre airport was built by the [[United States Navy]] in 1943 (known then as Roseland Satellite Field or Outlying Field Roseland) in support of naval flight training operations at nearby [[Vero Beach Municipal Airport|Naval Air Station Vero Beach]] and [[Melbourne International Airport|Naval Air Station Melbourne]].  The military paid approximately $1,300 for the property in 1943.  Inactivated as a naval facility following the end of World War II, the aviation facility was transferred by the War Assets Administration, as part of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, on January 29, 1959, to the City of Sebastian.  Upon taking responsibility, a provision was written in reference to the Federal Surplus Property Act, that the airport would be used without unfair discrimination solely for aviation purposes.  This provision provided that the property be given back to the United States in the event of noncompliance with any terms and conditions of the deed.\n\nSince its acquisition in 1959, Sebastian Municipal Airport (now 620 acres) has been maintained and operated by the City of Sebastian.  Since the transfer of ownership from the U.S. Government, Sebastian Municipal Airport has undergone numerous facility changes and improvements.  The noted championship Sebastian Municipal Golf Course was built in 1981 on a 155-acre plot of land occupying a large portion of the airport property and local area flight training greatly increased operations at the airport in the mid to late 1980s.  Currently, a Fixed Based Operator (FBO) occupys the west side of the airfield, and frequent skydiving activity accounts for a large portion of operations at the airport.  The addition of a number of commercial and private general aviation hangars and related aprons were developed along the west quadrant of the field.
