The use of an edge swiping gesture as a \"Back\" command was noted as potentially causing conflicts with apps that utilize [[Sidebar (computing)|sidebar menus]] and other functions accessible by swiping. An API can be used by apps to opt out of handling a back gesture within specific areas of the screen, a sensitivity control was added for adjusting the size of the target area to activate the gesture, and Google later stated that the drawer widget would support being \"peeked\" by long-pressing near the edge of the screen, and then swiped open.

OEMs are free to add their own gestures alongside them. However, they must not be enabled by default, they must be listed in a separate area one level deeper than other navigation settings, and they cannot be promoted using notifications.

Google ended the practice of giving major releases titles based on [[dessert]]s, arguing that this was not \"inclusive\" to international users (due either to the aforementioned foods not being internationally known, or being difficult to pronounce in some languages). Android VP of engineering Dave Burke did reveal during a podcast that, in addition, most desserts beginning with \"Q\" were \"exotic\", and that he personally would have chosen \"[[queen cake]]\".

The use of an edge swiping gesture as a \"Back\" command was noted as potentially causing conflicts with apps that utilize [[Sidebar (computing)|sidebar menus]] and other functions accessible by swiping. An API can be used by apps to opt out of handling a back gesture within specific areas of the screen, a sensitivity control was added for adjusting the size of the target area to activate the gesture, and Google later stated that the drawer widget would support being \"peeked\" by long-pressing near the edge of the screen, and then swiped open. The traditional three-key navigation system used since [[Android Honeycomb|Android \"Honeycomb\"]] remains supported as an option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20791457/google-android-q-back-gesture-controversy-app-drawer-navigation|title=Android Q's back gesture controversy, explained|last=Bohn|first=Dieter|date=August 8, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xda-developers.com/android-q-navigation-gestures-mandatory/|title=[Update: OEM Gestures Allowed] Google's new navigation gestures in Android Q will be mandatory for all devices|date=May 9, 2019|website=xda-developers|access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPer Google certification requirements, OEMs are required to support Android 10's default gestures and three-key navigation. OEMs are free to add their own gestures alongside them. However, they must not be enabled by default, they must be listed in a separate area one level deeper than other navigation settings, and they cannot be promoted using notifications. The two-key gesture navigation system used on [[Android Pie]] is deprecated, and may not be included on devices that ship with Android 10. However, it can still be included as an option for continuity purposes on devices upgraded from Pie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5google.com/2019/10/07/android-gesture-navigation-systems-google/|title=Google is hiding other forms of Android Gesture Navigation|last=Schoon|first=Ben|date=October 7, 2019|website=9to5Google|access-date=October 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== User experience ===\nA feature known as \"bubbles\" can be used to present content from supported apps in pop-up overlays (similarly to the overlay-based \"chat heads\" feature of [[Facebook Messenger]]). Apps can spawn bubbles via notifications.

Google stated that this cipher was five times faster than AES-256-XTS on an [[ARM Cortex-A7]] CPU. Therefore, device encryption is now mandatory on all Android 10 devices, regardless of specifications, using Adiantum if their CPU is not capable of hardware-accelerated AES.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.securityweek.com/google-improves-android-encryption-adiantum|title=Google Improves Android Encryption with Adiantum |website=SecurityWeek|access-date=September 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18220019/google-adiantum-storage-encryption-android-low-power-cheap-cost|title=Google wants to bring encryption to all with Adiantum|last=Porter|first=Jon|date=February 11, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=September 5, 2019}}</ref> In addition, implementation of \"file-based encryption\" (first introduced in [[Android Nougat]]) is also mandatory for all devices.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/android-10-privacy-security-features/|title=The Android 10 Privacy and Security Upgrades You Should Know About|work=Wired|access-date=September 5, 2019|issn=1059-1028}}</ref>\n\nOn devices shipping with Android 10, security patches for selected system components (such as [[ANGLE (software)|ANGLE]], Conscrypt, media frameworks, networking components, and others) may be serviced via [[Google Play Store]], without requiring a complete system update (\"Project Mainline\"). In order to license [[Google mobile services]], manufacturers must support these updates for specific modules, while the remainder are marked as \"recommended\" but optional.

The Atlantic slave trade was engaged in by European companies until it was outlawed in 1807.  After that illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast by native slavers. Britain's [[West Africa Squadron]] sought to intercept the smugglers at sea. The rescued slaves were taken to [[Freetown]], a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba [[Akitoye]], and signing the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] on 1 January 1852.

The following year, it chartered the [[Royal Niger Company]] under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British [[protectorate]], and part of the [[British Empire]], the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered [[Benin Empire|Benin]] in 1897, and, in the [[Anglo-Aro War]] (1901\u20131902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.  In 1914, the British formally united the Niger area as the ''Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria''. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Protectorates and [[Lagos Colony]].

With the fall of oil prices during the [[1980s oil glut]] Nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigerian authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its [[Paris Club]] creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15&nbsp;billion annually for poverty reduction programmes.

The spacecraft was operated by [[NigComSat]] and the Nigerian Space Agency, [[NASRDA]]. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after running out of power because of an anomaly in its solar array. It was based on the Chinese [[DFH-4]] [[satellite bus]], and carries a variety of [[transponder]]s: 4 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]]; 14 [[Ku-band]]; 8 [[Ka-band]]; and 2 [[L-band]]. It was designed to provide coverage to many parts of Africa, and the Ka-band transponders would also cover Italy.\n\nOn 10 November 2008 (0900 GMT), the satellite was reportedly switched off for analysis and to avoid a possible collision with other satellites.

The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country, owing to the influence of [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonisation]] that ended in 1960.\n\nMany French speakers from surrounding countries have influenced the English spoken in the border regions of Nigeria and some Nigerian citizens have become fluent enough in French to work in the surrounding countries. The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is mostly spoken like the French spoken in Benin. French may also be mixed with English as it is in Cameroon.\n\nThe major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[languages of Africa]]: the majority are [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Ijaw language|Ijaw]], [[Fulfulde]], [[Ogoni language|Ogoni]], and [[Edo language|Edo]]. [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily in [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]], is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] family, and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language.\n\nEven though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria itself.\n\nWith the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. [[Nigerian Pidgin English]], often known simply as \"[[Pidgin]]\" or \"Broken\" (Broken English), is also a popular [[lingua franca]], though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang. The pidgin English or Nigerian English is widely spoken within the [[Niger Delta]] Regions, predominantly in [[Warri]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Agenebode]], [[Ewu]], and [[Benin City]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Multilingualism: A Nigerian Case Study |first=Efurosibina E. |last=Adegbija |publisher=Africa World Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-59221-173-9 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=auI_WuBrWncC&pg=PA55 |location=Last paragraph |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Nigeria}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Nigeria (2013)<ref name=\"Cia 19\">CIA Factbook : Nigeria [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html] (Retrieved 1 May 2019)</ref>\n\n|label1 = [[Islam]]\n|value1 = 51.6\n|color1 = Green\n|label2 = [[Christianity]]\n|value2 = 47\n|color2 = DodgerBlue\n|label3 = [[Traditional African religions]]\n|value3 = 1.4\n|color3 = White\n}}\n\nNigeria is a religiously diverse society, with [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] being the most widely professed religions.

The Atlantic slave trade was engaged in by European companies until it was outlawed in 1807.  After that illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast by native slavers. Britain's [[West Africa Squadron]] sought to intercept the smugglers at sea. The rescued slaves were taken to [[Freetown]], a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba [[Akitoye]], and signing the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] on 1 January 1852.

The following year, it chartered the [[Royal Niger Company]] under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British [[protectorate]], and part of the [[British Empire]], the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered [[Benin Empire|Benin]] in 1897, and, in the [[Anglo-Aro War]] (1901\u20131902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.  In 1914, the British formally united the Niger area as the ''Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria''. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Protectorates and [[Lagos Colony]].

With the fall of oil prices during the [[1980s oil glut]] Nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigerian authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its [[Paris Club]] creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15&nbsp;billion annually for poverty reduction programmes.

The spacecraft was operated by [[NigComSat]] and the Nigerian Space Agency, [[NASRDA]]. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after running out of power because of an anomaly in its solar array. It was based on the Chinese [[DFH-4]] [[satellite bus]], and carries a variety of [[transponder]]s: 4 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]]; 14 [[Ku-band]]; 8 [[Ka-band]]; and 2 [[L-band]]. It was designed to provide coverage to many parts of Africa, and the Ka-band transponders would also cover Italy.\n\nOn 10 November 2008 (0900 GMT), the satellite was reportedly switched off for analysis and to avoid a possible collision with other satellites.

The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country, owing to the influence of [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonisation]] that ended in 1960.\n\nMany French speakers from surrounding countries have influenced the English spoken in the border regions of Nigeria and some Nigerian citizens have become fluent enough in French to work in the surrounding countries. The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is mostly spoken like the French spoken in Benin. French may also be mixed with English as it is in Cameroon.\n\nThe major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[languages of Africa]]: the majority are [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Ijaw language|Ijaw]], [[Fulfulde]], [[Ogoni language|Ogoni]], and [[Edo language|Edo]]. [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily in [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]], is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] family, and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language.\n\nEven though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria itself.\n\nWith the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. [[Nigerian Pidgin English]], often known simply as \"[[Pidgin]]\" or \"Broken\" (Broken English), is also a popular [[lingua franca]], though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang. The pidgin English or Nigerian English is widely spoken within the [[Niger Delta]] Regions, predominantly in [[Warri]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Agenebode]], [[Ewu]], and [[Benin City]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Multilingualism: A Nigerian Case Study |first=Efurosibina E. |last=Adegbija |publisher=Africa World Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-59221-173-9 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=auI_WuBrWncC&pg=PA55 |location=Last paragraph |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Nigeria}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Nigeria (2013)<ref name=\"Cia 19\">CIA Factbook : Nigeria [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html] (Retrieved 1 May 2019)</ref>\n\n|label1 = [[Islam]]\n|value1 = 51.6\n|color1 = Green\n|label2 = [[Christianity]]\n|value2 = 47\n|color2 = DodgerBlue\n|label3 = [[Traditional African religions]]\n|value3 = 1.4\n|color3 = White\n}}\n\nNigeria is a religiously diverse society, with [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] being the most widely professed religions.

The [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs throughout the year and no month is particularly dry. The hottest month is July (mean minimum temperature 16&nbsp;\u00b0C, mean maximum temperature 32&nbsp;\u00b0C) and the coldest are December\u2013January (mean minimum temperature \u221215&nbsp;\u00b0C, mean maximum temperature 0&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nCompared with other plain parts of India, Kashmir valley enjoys a more moderate climate but weather conditions are unpredictable. The recorded high temperature is 33&nbsp;\u00b0C and the recorded low is \u221218&nbsp;\u00b0C. On 5 and 6 January 2012, after years of relatively little snow, a wave of heavy snow and low temperatures ([[winter storm]]) shocked the valley covering it in a thick layer of snow and ice.\n\nKashmir Valley has seen an increase in relative humidity and annual precipitation in the last few years.

There are two styles of making tea in the region: [[Noon Chai]] or salt tea that is pink in colour (known as chinen posh rang or peach flower colour) and popular with locals, and [[kahwah]], a tea for festive occasions, made with [[saffron]] and spices (cardamom, cinnamon, sugar, noon chai leaves) and black tea.\n\n==Transport==\nKashmir valley is connected to Jammu and Ladakh regions by road and air. It has access to [[Jammu]] region and the rest of India through the [[Banihal]] road tunnel near [[Qazigund]] on national highway [[National Highway 1A (India)|NH 1A]] and through [[National Highway 1B (India, old numbering)|NH 1B]] that passes through [[Sinthan top|Sinthan pass]] and [[Kishtwar]].\n\n[[Srinagar]] is the main airport in Kashmir valley and has scheduled flights from Jammu, Leh, Mumbai, Chandigarh and New Delhi. Kashmir valley has a {{convert|119|km|abbr=on|0}} long modern [[Jammu\u2013Baramulla line|railway]] line that started in October 2009 and connects Baramulla in the western part of the valley to Srinagar and [[Qazigund]]. It further links the Kashmir Valley to Banihal across the Pir Panjal mountains through the new 11.215&nbsp;km (7 mile) long [[Pir Panjal Railway Tunnel]] or Banihal rail tunnel from 26 June 2013. Banihal railway station will be linked to the rest of India in another few years as the construction of the railway line from Jammu to Banihal progresses steadily. Transport within the valley is predominantly by road.Other airports are in [[Udhampur]], [[Leh]] and [[Jammu]]. Another airport is proposed in Anantnag.\n\n==Cities and towns==\n* [[Downtown Srinagar]]\n* [[Lal Bazar]]\n* [[Lal Chowk]]\n* [[Srinagar]]\n* [[Kulgam]]\n* [[Sopore]]\n* [[Kupwara]]\n* [[Pulwama]]\n* [[Baramulla]]\n* [[Anantnag]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n\n* [http://kashmirdivision.nic.in/ Kashmir Division Administration]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/divisionalcommissioner.kashmir Kashmir Divisional Commissioner]\n* {{Wikivoyage-inline}}\n* [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312921/Vale-of-Kashmir Vale of Kashmir]\n\n{{Kashmir Valley}}\n\n{{Jammu and Kashmir topics}}\n\n{{coord|34.0333|N|74.6667|E|source:wikidata-and-enwiki-cat-tree_region:IN|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Valleys of Jammu and Kashmir]]\n[[Category:River valleys of India]]\n[[Category:Jammu and Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Kashmir]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Kashmir (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2012}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                            = Kashmir Division\n| official_name                   = \n| native_name                     = \n| native_name_lang                = \n| other_name                      = \n| nickname                        = Peer Waer (Garden of saints)\nParadise on Earth,\nResh Waer <ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.india.com/travel/articles/9-photos-proves-jammu-kashmir-paradise-earth/| title=8 photos that prove Jammu & Kashmir is paradise on Earth| date=2015-02-14| access-date=1 February 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230002106/http://www.india.com/travel/articles/9-photos-proves-jammu-kashmir-paradise-earth/| archive-date=30 December 2016| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| settlement_type                 = [[Divisions of India|Administrative Division]] \n| translit_lang1_type             = \n| image_skyline                   = Kashmir-sat-nasa.jpg\n| image_alt                       = \n| image_caption                   = Kashmir valley seen from a satellite.

One weekend, Ji-soo has a study project to do with Bae Gyu-ri, a girl he has a crush on, and thus tells Mr. Lee to take the day off. Knowing that she won't be protected, Min-hee still accepts the offer of a client unaware that he had previously assaulted one of the sex workers and that she is walking into a trap.

Its antecedents go back to the Dogra Corps raised by intrepid Raja [[Gulab Singh]] of [[Jammu Division|Jammu]] in 1821, under the suzerainty of [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] of [[Sikh Empire]]. General [[Zorawar Singh Kahluria|Zorawar Singh]] led daredevil campaigns in northern areas like [[Ladakh]], [[Baltistan]], [[Gilgit]], [[State of Hunza|Hunza]] and [[Yagistan]], consolidating smaller principalities and making the northern areas a part of the expanding dominions of Gulab Singh. He also mounted a breath-taking invasion of [[Tibet]] in 1841.\n\nAfter the establishment of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as independent princely state under the [[British Paramountcy]] in [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|1846]], these troops became the '''Jammu and Kashmir State Forces'''.\n\nThe Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir maintained a larger number of State Forces than any other ruler of an Indian State under the British Raj. These forces were organized into the Jammu and Kashmir Brigades. They comprised a bodyguard cavalry regiment, two mountain batteries, seven infantry battalions, one training battalions and a transport unit consisting of both pack and mechanized transport. Several of these units served with distinction on the North-West Frontier of India and overseas during the Great War.<ref name=globalsecurity/> The state forces fought as [[Imperial Service Troops]] in both the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War|Second]] World Wars (under their own native officers).

It was their heroic stand that gained time for the entry of the Indian Army and thus saved the [[Kashmir Valley]]. It may not be out of place to mention that the Indian people largely owe the State of Jammu and Kashmir to the heroic defensive stand made by the outnumbered and ill-equipped, but highly motivated, J&K State Force. They paid a steep price in blood and sacrificed over 76 officers, 31 JCOs and 1085 Other Ranks.
