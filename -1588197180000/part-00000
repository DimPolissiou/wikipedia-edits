{"title_page": "High Sheriff of Sligo", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\nThe '''High Sheriff of Sligo''' was the British Crown's judicial representative in [[County Sligo]], Ireland from the 16th century until 1922, when the office was abolished in the new Free State and replaced by the office of Sligo County Sheriff. The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year. The dates given hereunder are the dates of appointment. All addresses are in County Sligo unless stated otherwise.\n\nSligo was constituted a county in 1568 by Sir [[Henry Sidney]], Lord Deputy of Ireland, but a sheriff does not appear to have been appointed until the year 1576 at the request of the [[O'Connor Sligo]].\n\n==High Sheriffs of County Sligo==\n* ''Source: History of Sligo'' <ref name = HoS>{{cite web| url =

The sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord-Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year. The dates given hereunder are the dates of appointment. All addresses are in County Sligo unless stated otherwise.\n\nSligo was constituted a county in 1568 by Sir [[Henry Sidney]], Lord Deputy of Ireland, but a sheriff does not appear to have been

It was backed and promoted by [[Michael Moore]],<ref>{{cite web | title=New Michael Moore-backed doc tackles alternative energy | website=[[AP news]] | date=2019-08-08 | url=https://apnews.com/933b49681b0d47d3a005d356f35251ab |  access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref> who was the executive producer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/22/planet-of-the-humans-review-environment-michael-moore-jeff-gibbs|title=Planet of the Humans review \u2013 contrarian eco-doc from the Michael Moore stable|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|date=April 22, 2020|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>  Moore released it on YouTube for free watching.\n\nThe film makers would have us believe that the central thesis of the film is that reductions in [[Overconsumption|consumption]] and [[world population|population]] might be needed because humans can't rely on green energy to achieve sustainability; however, most of the film is filled with distortions, half-truths, and one-sided attacks on green energy and environmentalists. One reason is that sustainability encompasses areas beyond fossil fuel concerns, (like species\u2018 extinctions due to habitat loss through agriculture). Another that human energy needs are too great. And finally that the green energy movement is corrupt and misleading.

It was first composed by Debussy around 1890, at the age of 28, it was significantly revised just before its publication in 1905.<ref name=\"Roberts\">{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Roberts|title=Images: The Piano Music of Claude Debussy|location=Portland, Oregon|year=1996}}</ref>\n\nThe composer loathed publishing these relatively early piano compositions because they were not in his mature style. However, in 1905 he accepted the offer of a publisher who thought they would be successful given the fame Debussy had won in the intervening fifteen years of his career.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/> While it is not known how much of the ''Suite'' was written in 1890 and how much was written in 1905, it is clear that Debussy changed the names of at least two of the pieces. Passepied was first composed under the name \"Pavane\", while \"Clair de lune\" was originally titled \"Promenade sentimentale\". These names also come from [[Paul Verlaine]]'s poems.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/> The final title of ''Suite Bergamasque'' comes from Verlaine's poem \"[[Clair de Lune (poem)|Clair de lune]]\", which refers to [[bergamask]]s in its opening stanza: \n\n<poem lang=\"fr\" style=\"float:left;\">\nVotre \u00e2me est un paysage choisi\nQue vont charmant masques et bergamasques\nJouant du luth et dansant et quasi\nTristes sous leurs d\u00e9guisements fantasques.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/853446.html|title=Excerpt, ''One Hundred and One Poems by Paul Verlaine'', a bilingual edition, translated by Norman R.

Pr\u00e9lude===\nThe first piece in the suite is entitled \"Pr\u00e9lude\", in the key of F major and marked [[rubato|''tempo rubato'']]. It is full of dynamic contrasts with a vigorous beginning and ending. It is a festive piece, which holds much of the [[Baroque music|Baroque style]] that is commonly found in preludes.\n\n===2. Menuet===\nThe second part of the ''Suite Bergamasque'' is the Menuet, in A minor. Its playful main theme contrasts with an alternatively mysterious and dramatic middle section. This piece is particularly original, as it does not conform to the particular style that most [[minuet]]s share. Rather than being very airy and dainty, it shows much more raw comedy. Again, Debussy sets a very novel piece in the guise of an old dance style.\n\n===3. Clair de Lune (Moonlight){{anchor|3._Clair_de_lune}}===\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Clair de lune (Claude Debussy) Suite bergamasque.ogg|title=\"Clair de lune\"|description=Performed by Laurens Goedhart in 2011 (5:04)}}\nThe third and most famous movement of ''Suite bergamasque'' is \"Clair de lune\", in D{{music|flat}} major. Its name comes from [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]'s poem \"[[Clair de Lune (poem)|Clair de lune]]\", which means \"moonlight\" in French. It is written in {{music|time|9|8}} [[meter (music)|meter]], marked ''andante tr\u00e8s expressif'', and to be played mostly ''pianissimo''. It is not to be confused with the two settings of the poem made by Debussy for voice and piano accompaniment.\n\n===4. Passepied===\nThe final movement is Passepied in F{{music|sharp}} minor, ''allegretto ma non troppo''. A [[passepied]] is a type of dance that originated in [[Brittany]].

It was first composed by Debussy around 1890, at the age of 28, but was significantly revised just before its publication in 1905.<ref name=\"Roberts\">{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Roberts|title=Images: The Piano Music of Claude Debussy|location=Portland, Oregon|year=1996}}</ref>\n\nThe composer was loath to publish these relatively early piano compositions because they were not in his mature style, but in 1905 accepted the offer of a publisher who thought they would be successful given the fame Debussy had won in the intervening fifteen years.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/> While it is not known how much of the ''Suite'' was written in 1890 and how much was written in 1905, it is clear that Debussy changed the names of at least two of the pieces. Passepied had first been composed under the name \"Pavane\", while \"Clair de lune\" was originally titled \"Promenade sentimentale\". These names also come from [[Paul Verlaine]]'s poems.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/> The final title of ''Suite bergamasque'' comes from Verlaine's poem \"[[Clair de Lune (poem)|Clair de lune]]\", which refers to [[bergamask]]s in its opening stanza: \n\n<poem lang=\"fr\" style=\"float:left;\">\nVotre \u00e2me est un paysage choisi\nQue vont charmant masques et bergamasques\nJouant du luth et dansant et quasi\nTristes sous leurs d\u00e9guisements fantasques.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/853446.html|title=Excerpt, ''One Hundred and One Poems by Paul Verlaine'', a bilingual edition, translated by Norman R.

Pr\u00e9lude===\nThe first piece in the suite is entitled \"Pr\u00e9lude\", in the key of F major and marked [[rubato|''tempo rubato'']]. It is full of dynamic contrasts with a vigorous beginning and ending. It is a festive piece, which holds much of the [[Baroque music|Baroque style]] that is commonly found in preludes.\n\n===2. Menuet===\nThe second part of the ''Suite bergamasque'' is the Menuet, in A minor. Its playful main theme contrasts with an alternatively mysterious and dramatic middle section. This piece is particularly original, as it does not conform to the particular style that most [[minuet]]s share. Rather than being very airy and dainty, it shows much more raw comedy. Again, Debussy sets a very novel piece in the guise of an old dance style.\n\n===3. Clair de lune (Moonlight){{anchor|3._Clair_de_lune}}===\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Clair de lune (Claude Debussy) Suite bergamasque.ogg|title=\"Clair de lune\"|description=Performed by Laurens Goedhart in 2011 (5:04)}}\nThe third and most famous movement of ''Suite bergamasque'' is \"Clair de lune\", in D{{music|flat}} major. Its name comes from [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]'s poem \"[[Clair de Lune (poem)|Clair de lune]]\", which means \"moonlight\" in French. It is written in {{music|time|9|8}} [[meter (music)|meter]], marked ''andante tr\u00e8s expressif'', and to be played mostly ''pianissimo''. It is not to be confused with the two settings of the poem made by Debussy for voice and piano accompaniment.\n\n===4. Passepied===\nThe final movement is Passepied in F{{music|sharp}} minor, ''allegretto ma non troppo''. A [[passepied]] is a type of dance which originated in [[Brittany]]. Debussy's \"Passepied\" is a happy, strangely medieval piece, which is surprisingly faster than its Baroque counterparts. Throughout most of its duration, the piece is played with staccato arpeggios in the left hand.\n\n==Arrangements==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2019}}\nThe ''Suite bergamasque'' has been [[Orchestration|orchestrated]] by many conductors, including [[Andr\u00e9 Caplet]], [[Leopold Stokowski]], and [[Lucien Cailliet]].\n\n\"Clair de lune\" in particular has been arranged for a wide variety of instrumental combinations. One such is [[Dimitri Tiomkin]]'s arrangement for organ in the score for the 1956 film ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]''.\n\n\"Clair de lune\" was originally to be included as a fully orchestrated piece in the 1940 [[Walt Disney]] animated film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', but was not included in the final cut of the film due to running time issues, with the footage for its intended segment (featuring [[Great blue heron|herons]] in the Florida [[Everglades]] at night) being recycled for the \"Blue Bayou\" segment of the later film ''[[Make Mine Music]]''.
