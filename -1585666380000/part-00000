(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2020. This was the second season with [[Rik van de Westelaken]] as host. The location of the season was the [[Henan]] province in [[China|The People's Republic of China]], the second time the series had filmed in China, following [[Hong Kong]] in season 14. The season premiered on January 11, 2020. While the originally planned Live Finale aired with no audience on March 14, 2020. During the Reunion, Buddy Vedder was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac13,400.-. Vedder, alongside his runner-ups Miljuschka Witzenhausen and Nathan Rutjes, had successfully unmasked Rob Dekay as the Mole.\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Mexico]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are 3 remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith the exception of the Black Exemption, that has been included throughout the series since its introduction in Season 14, there were no major twists added to the season. However, after 13 years since Season 7, this season was the second to end with four candidates competing in the Finale to unmask the Mole.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|{{ill|Rob Dekay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Buddy Vedder|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Miljuschka Witzenhausen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|[[Nathan Rutjes]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|19\n|{{nowrap|Second Runner-Up}}\n|-\n|{{ill|Leonie ter Braak|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|16\n|4th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Claes Iversen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|12\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Johan Goossens|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|10\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Jaike Belfor|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|6\n|7th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Tina de Bruin|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|8th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Anita Witzier|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|3\n|9th place\n|}\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

He gives everyone the option to either choose wisdom or luck by going through the left or right gate. Once the contestant has gone through the gate, they got a key and a note with a pattern of Chinese characters. When they went further ahead, they encountered a giant wall with more Chinese characters on it. The contestant then had to match the pattern on their note with the corresponding pattern on the wall. When they found their pattern, they got to open the box underneath, and if it was correct, there was a reward inside for them to keep.\n\nIf the contestant chose for luck, they got an 'exemption', which would automatically grant them a spot in the next round when used at the test.

Throughout the time limit of 20 minutes, electric cars of various colours drive past the contestants, with various words of colours placed on the backs of each car (which are also in various colours). After the time limit, Rik asks the contestant who wrote down the group's observations three questions about the number of red cars, number of cars with the word 'red' on their back, and how many words were written in red. Each correct answer earned \u20ac500.- for the pot.\n\nThe contestants failed the assignment and earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'Mol Laser' (Mole Laser) - Max. \u20ac1,600.-\nThe annual laser-game assignment occurred in the early evening in a barrack in the Luoyang. Throughout the barracks are light installations in which the contestants would have to shoot at with a laser gun. For each red light the contestants hit and turn green, they earn \u20ac100.- for the pot. However, they will be playing one on one against the Mole, who has to shoot green lights red to remove \u20ac100.- from the pot. Each round ends when either the contestant or the Mole is hit by their opponent's laser gun.\n\nThe outcome of the assignment will be revealed during the live reunion at the end of the season.\n\n;'Scherp Stellen' (Sharp Couples) - Max. \u20ac1,500.-\nTaken to a tourist theme park in Luoyang, Rik read out a list of 15 photographs the contestants had to take with the locals in the theme park. Some involved a combination of group photos with locals including certain contestants, some with only locals wearing specific outfits, or in specific locations. The contestants had 20 minutes to complete the assignment. Each correct photograph supplied to Rik earned \u20ac100.- for the pot.\n\n\u20ac400.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Executie' (Execution)\nBefore the Execution ceremony began, Rik informed the group that they had an opportunity to avoid viewing their results during this execution. Each contestant had to select between a Red or Green card hidden by Rik. If the contestant chose a Green card, they got to choose someone else who didn't have to see their results screen. If the contestant chose a Red card, they would choose who will see their result screen. The execution game ends if someone sees a Red screen, or if all contestants chosen to see their results screen only see Green; thus everyone proceeding to the next episode.\n===Episode 8 - Doorgeven===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 8 - Doorgeven\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 29 February 2020<br>Locations: [[Luoyang, Henan]]\n|-\n!

The two remaining contestants stay by the map at the starting point and must direct the three cyclists over the phone to the coloured bicycles throughout the city. Starting on blue bicycles, each of the cycles must proceed to swap bicycles in the order of Blue, Orange, White, and lastly Green before returning to the start. The more swaps each cyclist makes, the more money is earned for the pot if the cyclist returns within the 30 minute time limit.\n\n\u20ac250.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Je Draai Vinden' (Find Your Way)\nAfter lunch, the contestants were escorted to a prominent dining venue in Luoyang that [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] [[Xi Jinping]] had dined in while visiting the city. Once seated at the table, Rik informed the group that they would be answering 10 questions about their journey so far, with the goal of acquiring the most points. After each question (starting with the contestant that drew first, then clockwise around the table) each contestant is given the choice to keep their answer, or rotate the table until they get the answer they want from another contestant. The contestant with the most points after 10 questions receives an Exemption that they can use for the next Execution. In the event of a tie, the first contestant to break the tie wins the Exemption.\n\nMiljuschka broke the tiebreaker against Nathan and won the Exemption.\n\n;'Doorzichtig' (Transparant) - Max. \u20ac2,000.-\nTaking the morning to drive to the Three Gorges Scenic Area, the contestants were instructed to position themselves along a glass suspension bridge high above the Yellow River.; a common feature in parks around China. Across the bridge stood 6 boxes with tubes in 5 of them. At the beginning of the assignment, the contestants could look once inside the tubes at their corresponding boxes to see the amount of money they held. Once they have looked at their tubes, the group must swap them among themselves to fill five box with three vials to match the \u20ac amount on the lid of the box. The boxes increase in amounts from \u20ac80.-, to a sixth box valued at \u20ac1,200.- that can hold 9 tubes. The group has 20 minutes to complete the assignment, and only boxes with the correct tubes in them would become money for the pot.\n\n\u20ac80.- was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 9 - Sturen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode  - Sturen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 7 March 2020<br>Locations: [[Luoyang, Henan]]\n|-\n!

After the first viewing, Rik revealed that in duos, the group must decipher the number sequence the children in the Martial Arts demonstration are performing, with the help of a number chart. After three more viewings of the demonstration, Rik approached the treasurer, Nathan, and asked if the other duo knew the answer. If the treasurer's judgment is correct, the group would earn \u20ac1,750.-. \n\nThe contestants failed the assignment and earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'Onder de Pannen?' (Under the Pans?) - Max. N/A\n\nThat evening in the Shi Jie Night Market in Luoyang, the contestants were tasked for form duos again between two food carts. They had two hours to prepare, cook, and sell Dutch food to the local marketgoers. For every transaction made, the group earned money for the pot. After the assignment was complete, the group found out that they had 49 successful transactions at \u20ac25 per transaction, however, as the game has no \u20ac5.- note, the group's winnings were rounded down to the nearest zero.\n\n\u20ac1,220.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Richtingsgevoel?' (Sense of Direction) - Max. \u20ac6,000.-\n\nThe final assignment took place at the Lijing Gate, where one at a time, the contestants met with Rik for one final offer. Along the top floor of the gate stood 6 doors in which the contestants could check to earn money. However, each contestant had to choose either to risk \u20ac500, \u20ac1,000, or \u20ac1,500 from the pot for the assignment. The Mole's voice is put through software to disguise themselves from the contestants. Once they have made their choice known to Rik, the Mole separates the money between 1 to 3 of the six doors and calls the contestant over the phone to tell them where they hid the money. The contestant must decide after every two doors to believe or distrust the Mole's instructions to check for money. The game continues until either all the money they risked is collected, or if the contestant has checked up to 3 doors of the six doors. Whatever money they managed to retrieve would be doubled and put back into the final pot.\n\nThe outcome of the assignment will be revealed during the live reunion at the end of the season.\n\nAfter the assignment, Rik informed the four contestants that they were indeed the finalists (to their surprise) and to prepare for their final test of the season.\n\n===Episode 10 - Finale===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 10 - Finale\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 14 March 2020<br>Locations: [[Amsterdam|Amsterdam, Netherlands]]\n|-\n!

The finalists, Buddy, Miljuschka, Nathan, and Rob were gathered the morning of the Live Finale for the reveal of the Mole and the outcome of the final test back in Luoyang, Henan. With the final test being multiple choice out of 40 questions, in Third place was Nathan with a score of 34. Second place, Miljuschka, totaling up to 37 out of 40. At the announcement that Rob was the Mole, Buddy won the season with a final test score of an outstanding 39 out of 40.\n\nAfter the reveal of the Mole's identity, it was revealed that Rob managed to remove \u20ac300.- from the pot in the Mol Laser assignment. Despite his best efforts, the Finalists managed to earn \u20ac2,500.- for the pot during the final assignment, Richtingsgevoel. Leaving a grand total of \u20ac13,400 in the winner's pot for Buddy.\n\n==Mole Sabotage==\nRob's strategy as the Mole was to play up his superfan status of Wie is de Mol on and off camera to the annoyance of the production to throw off his fellow Candidates. His strategy worked as only on the final test did the other Candidates finally chose him as their Moles.\n\n'''Beltegoed:''' While the group were scattered throughout the market gathering local Chinese people to use their phones for the assignment, Rob would sabotage the tablets to display lower amounts of money for the group to photograph.\n\n'''Parkeertarief:''' Rob was informed that the truck he was locked in with Leonie would cause the group to earn a maximum of \u20ac200,- if they did not get out. So he delayed solving their puzzle until the time ran out. Luckily a second truck did not complete their assignment, thus the group only managed to earn \u20ac20,- for the assignment.\n\n'''Beeldig:''' Rob placed himself in the group that had to search for envelopes in this assignment. His goal was to make sure neither group collected the correct envelopes. Directing his group to incorrect statues as quickly as he could to make sure Minus money would be collected. In one instance he took out money from one of the correct envelopes (and hid it in his hat) to further reduce the group's earnings from the assignment.\n\n'''Verkeer(d):''' With Nathan as Treasurer selecting the group's roles in the assignment, Rob lucked out into the Traffic Guide position where he could give false directions over the radio phones to the drivers when he felt like it. In such a powerful position, he managed to make sure to keep the pot low by making sure only 7 out of the 10 cars were correctly driven and parked for a mere \u20ac320,-. His poor \"Etherdiscipline\" aided in delaying and confusing the Candidates further throughout the assignment.\n\n'''Lettergreep:''' Aware of which letters had to be found for the second stage of the assignment, Rob ran the first stage as a fanatical candidate and found 4 letters and the Question Mark. As the W was not found, that reduced the potential earning, and during the second stage, he let Leonie take charge in searching for the remaining money without helping behind the scenes.\n\n'''Voice Mol:''' While Buddy took charge of the measuring for this assignment, Rob would be on the other end of the measuring tape, pulling the tape further than necessary to fudge the certain distances. Once all the phones were found, he made sure that a certain distance was one meter off to make sure the group never called Rik.\n\n'''Alles Kenners:''' Rob volunteered to enter the village first, so that he could switch the correct envelopes with wrong envelopes. Further sabotage was that he searched for the sand vials for the timer and dig holes in the ground to hide them from the group, meaning less time for Nathan to search for the correct envelopes he had already sabotaged.\n\n'''Mol Laser:''' Rob managed to hide throughout the laser tag field against most of the candidates, however, when it came down to Nathan's battle against him, Nathan's antics scared Rob until he chose to be taken out instead of being caught and unmasked. In the end of the assignment, Rob managed to take out \u20ac300.- from the group's pot.\n\n'''Scherp Stellen:''' Having memorized the 15 photographs required for the assignment beforehand, Rob made sure that the others didn't remember the correct instructions; causing only 4 out of the 15 photographs to be correct at the end of the assignment.\n\n'''Cijferkunst:''' Knowing that Nathan as the treasurer would have an influential role at the end of the assignment, Rob avoided pairing up with him. Paired up with Buddy, who wanted to bait Rob into sabotaging, he let Buddy bait him into giving Rik the wrong answer and causing the assignment to fail. It was the moment that Buddy finally locked onto Rob as the Mole, as the group's main suspect Leonie had just been executed from the game.\n\n'''Richtingsgevoel:''' Using a voice muffler over a phone, Rob tried to use reverse psychology against Nathan, to no avail. Leading to Nathan reclaiming the money he risked. With Miljuschka, he chose to build trust to bluff her later, however she too didn't fall for his tricks. Eventually, when he got to Buddy he managed to fool him out of \u20ac500.-, the eventual total in the assignment led up to \u20ac2,500.-, out of a potential \u20ac4,500.-.\n\n==Hidden Clues==\n'''Episode 1 - Afgeschermd:''' In ''Beltegoed'', Rob made sure to point out the \u20ac20.- to indicate that he was the 20th Mole.\n\n'''Episode 5 - Aangeraakt:''' The Candidates and audience could have spotted the Mole in ''Lezen en Schrijven''. One of the fans in the park said \"The Mole is here\" when Rob was on the screen searching.\n\n'''Episode Titles:''' The titles throughout the season pointed out to Rob's sabotages, Episode 2 ''Tegendraads'', which translates to contrary, is shown when the wires in ''Kleur Werk'' near Rob and Claes were in the contrary direction than where they should have been. ''Misleid'' (Mislead) pointed to Rob's role as the Traffic Guide misleading the drivers. ''Aangeraakt'' (Touched) had Rob literally touch the letters M, O, L, in that order during the ''Lettergreep'' assignment.\n\n'''Verkeer(d):''' During the beginning of the assignment, taking the first, second, third, and fourth letters of the first four road signs shown on screen, the letters M, O, L, R would spell out Mol R. A subtle suggestion that Rob was the Mole.\n\n'''Mol Laser:''' Rob's confessionals during this assignment were presented as the Mol talking to his opponents. And during his turn in the assignment he called out each of his opponents during the battle.\n\n'''Episode 6 - Voor Geen Meter:''' Rik's introduction monologue in this episode made a direct reference to one of Rob's tattoos. \"De Mol is tevreden.\" (The Mole is satisfied.) The words \"Tevreden\" is tattooed on Rob's shoulder, which is shown throughout the season.\n==Viewing Figures==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"| Viewing Figures\n|-\n! #\n!

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2020. This was the second season with [[Rik van de Westelaken]] as host. The location of the season was the [[Henan]] province in [[China|The People's Republic of China]], the second time the series had filmed in China, following [[Hong Kong]] in season 14. The season premiered on January 11, 2020. While the originally planned Live Finale aired with no audience on March 14, 2020. During the Reunion, Buddy Vedder was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac13,400.-. Vedder, alongside his runner-ups Miljuschka Witzenhausen and Nathan Rutjes, had successfully unmasked Rob Dekay as the Mole.\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Mexico]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are 3 remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith the exception of the Black Exemption, that has been included throughout the series since its introduction in Season 14, there were no major twists added to the season.

When they went further ahead, they encountered a giant wall with more Chinese characters on it. The contestant then had to match the pattern on their note with the corresponding pattern on the wall. When they found their pattern, they got to open the box underneath, and if it was correct, there was a reward inside for them to keep.\n\nIf the contestant chose for luck, they got an 'exemption', which would automatically grant them a spot in the next round when used at the test.

The group were provided a tape measure to record the distances, and 20 minutes to call Rik's phone.\n\nThe contestants failed the assignment and earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'Vak Werk' (Box Work) - Max. \u20ac2,500.-\nThe contestants were assigned to 6 large demarcated boxes in a public plaza in Luoyang. Accompanying each contestant were a group of local people from the city. If the contestants and their corresponding group of locals were in the correct composition, they could earn \u20ac2,500.-. During the 15 minutes of the assignment, Rik will show the contestants how much their combination is worth. At the end of the assignment, one of the contestants must vacate their box and approach Rik to cash out and find out the final total earned in the assignment. The assignment is a complicated version of [[Mastermind (board game)|Mastermind]].\n\n\u20ac1,030.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Alles Kenners' (All the Experts) - Max. \u20ac1,500.-\n\nIn the village of Weijiapo, an ancient village in the shape of a dragon, the contestants are instructed to enter the village one by one. Inside the village are envelopes with names on it. (These names were the usernames of Wie is de Mol fans in the official fan forums.) For 5 minutes each, the first 5 contestants must report back to the group on the layout of the village and the locations of the envelopes. The group can only map out the village and envelopes using a chalkboard at the entrance. Hidden throughout the village are tubes of sand which is needed for the last contestant's entry into the village. If any of the contestants are not back at the village entrance within 5 minutes, any tubes of sand in their possession is removed from the assignment. Once the last contestant is ready to enter the village, Rik indicates which five envelopes they must collect to earn money, the twist is that all the names have been removed from the envelopes before the last contestant enters the village. The tubes are used for a sand timer as the final time limit. Correct envelopes collected adds money to the pot, while incorrect envelopes removes money from the pot.\n\n\u20ac200.- was removed from the pot.\n\n===Episode 7 - Tegenstander===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 7 - Tegenstander\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 22 February 2020<br>Locations: [[Luoyang, Henan]]\n|-\n!

Therefore, no one was executed.\n|-\n!colspan=3|Execution\n|-\n|colspan=3| No one executed\n|}\n\n;'Kleur Rijk' (Colourful) - Max. \u20ac1,500.-\nIn the midst of the local Dayang factory in Luoyang, the group select one contestant to record the group's observations, with special emphasis to the colours they see. Throughout the time limit of 20 minutes, electric cars of various colours drive past the contestants, with various words of colours placed on the backs of each car (which are also in various colours). After the time limit, Rik asks the contestant who wrote down the group's observations three questions about the number of red cars, number of cars with the word 'red' on their back, and how many words were written in red. Each correct answer earned \u20ac500.- for the pot.\n\nThe contestants failed the assignment and earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'Mol Laser' (Mole Laser) - Max. \u20ac1,600.-\nThe annual laser-game assignment occurred in the early evening in a barrack in the Luoyang. Throughout the barracks are light installations in which the contestants would have to shoot at with a laser gun. For each red light the contestants hit and turn green, they earn \u20ac100.- for the pot. However, they will be playing one on one against the Mole, who has to shoot green lights red to remove \u20ac100.- from the pot. Each round ends when either the contestant or the Mole is hit by their opponent's laser gun.\n\nThe outcome of the assignment will be revealed during the live reunion at the end of the season.\n\n;'Scherp Stellen' (Sharp Couples) - Max. \u20ac1,500.-\nTaken to a tourist theme park in Luoyang, Rik read out a list of 15 photographs the contestants had to take with the locals in the theme park. Some involved a combination of group photos with locals including certain contestants, some with only locals wearing specific outfits, or in specific locations. The contestants had 20 minutes to complete the assignment. Each correct photograph supplied to Rik earned \u20ac100.- for the pot.\n\n\u20ac400.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Executie' (Execution)\nBefore the Execution ceremony began, Rik informed the group that they had an opportunity to avoid viewing their results during this execution. Each contestant had to select between a Red or Green card hidden by Rik. If the contestant chose a Green card, they got to choose someone else who didn't have to see their results screen. If the contestant chose a Red card, they would choose who will see their result screen. The execution game ends if someone sees a Red screen, or if all contestants chosen to see their results screen only see Green; thus everyone proceeding to the next episode.\n===Episode 8 - Doorgeven===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 8 - Doorgeven\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 29 February 2020<br>Locations: [[Luoyang, Henan]]\n|-\n!

The two remaining contestants stay by the map at the starting point and must direct the three cyclists over the phone to the coloured bicycles throughout the city. Starting on blue bicycles, each of the cycles must proceed to swap bicycles in the order of Blue, Orange, White, and lastly Green before returning to the start. The more swaps each cyclist makes, the more money is earned for the pot if the cyclist returns within the 30 minute time limit.\n\n\u20ac250.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Je Draai Vinden' (Find Your Way)\nAfter lunch, the contestants were escorted to a prominent dining venue in Luoyang that [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] [[Xi Jinping]] had dined in while visiting the city. Once seated at the table, Rik informed the group that they would be answering 10 questions about their journey so far, with the goal of acquiring the most points. After each question (starting with the contestant that drew first, then clockwise around the table) each contestant is given the choice to keep their answer, or rotate the table until they get the answer they want from another contestant. The contestant with the most points after 10 questions receives an Exemption that they can use for the next Execution. In the event of a tie, the first contestant to break the tie wins the Exemption.\n\nMiljuschka broke the tiebreaker against Nathan and won the Exemption.\n\n;'Doorzichtig' (Transparant) - Max. \u20ac2,000.-\nTaking the morning to drive to the Three Gorges Scenic Area, the contestants were instructed to position themselves along a glass suspension bridge high above the Yellow River.; a common feature in parks around China. Across the bridge stood 6 boxes with tubes in 5 of them. At the beginning of the assignment, the contestants could look once inside the tubes at their corresponding boxes to see the amount of money they held. Once they have looked at their tubes, the group must swap them among themselves to fill five box with three vials to match the \u20ac amount on the lid of the box. The boxes increase in amounts from \u20ac80.-, to a sixth box valued at \u20ac1,200.- that can hold 9 tubes. The group has 20 minutes to complete the assignment, and only boxes with the correct tubes in them would become money for the pot.\n\n\u20ac80.- was earned for the pot.\n\n===Episode 9 - Sturen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode  - Sturen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 7 March 2020<br>Locations: [[Luoyang, Henan]]\n|-\n!

After the first viewing, Rik revealed that in duos, the group must decipher the number sequence the children in the Martial Arts demonstration are performing, with the help of a number chart. After three more viewings of the demonstration, Rik approached the treasurer, Nathan, and asked if the other duo knew the answer. If the treasurer's judgment is correct, the group would earn \u20ac1,750.-. \n\nThe contestants failed the assignment and earned nothing for the pot.\n\n;'Onder de Pannen?' (Under the Pans?) - Max. N/A\n\nThat evening in the Shi Jie Night Market in Luoyang, the contestants were tasked for form duos again between two food carts. They had two hours to prepare, cook, and sell Dutch food to the local marketgoers. For every transaction made, the group earned money for the pot. After the assignment was complete, the group found out that they had 49 successful transactions at \u20ac25 per transaction, however, as the game has no \u20ac5.- note, the group's winnings were rounded down to the nearest zero.\n\n\u20ac1,220.- was earned for the pot.\n\n;'Richtingsgevoel?' (Sense of Direction) - Max. \u20ac6,000.-\n\nThe final assignment took place at the Lijing Gate, where one at a time, the contestants met with Rik for one final offer. Along the top floor of the gate stood 6 doors in which the contestants could check to earn money. However, each contestant had to choose either to risk \u20ac500, \u20ac1,000, or \u20ac1,500 from the pot for the assignment. The Mole's voice is put through software to disguise themselves from the contestants. Once they have made their choice known to Rik, the Mole separates the money between 1 to 3 of the six doors and calls the contestant over the phone to tell them where they hid the money. The contestant must decide after every two doors to believe or distrust the Mole's instructions to check for money. The game continues until either all the money they risked is collected, or if the contestant has checked up to 3 doors of the six doors. Whatever money they managed to retrieve would be doubled and put back into the final pot.\n\nThe outcome of the assignment will be revealed during the live reunion at the end of the season.\n\nAfter the assignment, Rik informed the four contestants that they were indeed the finalists (to their surprise) and to prepare for their final test of the season.\n\n===Episode 10 - Finale===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 10 - Finale\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 14 March 2020<br>Locations: [[Amsterdam|Amsterdam, Netherlands]]\n|-\n!

The finalists, Buddy, Miljuschka, Nathan, and Rob were gathered the morning of the Live Finale for the reveal of the Mole and the outcome of the final test back in Luoyang, Henan. With the final test being multiple choice out of 40 questions, in Third place was Nathan with a score of 34. Second place, Miljuschka, totaling up to 37 out of 40. At the announcement that Rob was the Mole, Buddy won the season with a final test score of an outstanding 39 out of 40.\n\nAfter the reveal of the Mole's identity, it was revealed that Rob managed to remove \u20ac300.- from the pot in the Mol Laser assignment. Despite his best efforts, the Finalists managed to earn \u20ac2,500.- for the pot during the final assignment, Richtingsgevoel. Leaving a grand total of \u20ac13,400 in the winner's pot for Buddy.\n\n==Mole Sabotage==\nRob's strategy as the Mole was to play up his superfan status of Wie is de Mol on and off camera to the annoyance of the production to throw off his fellow Candidates. His strategy worked as only on the final test did the other Candidates finally chose him as their Moles.\n\n'''Beltegoed:''' While the group were scattered throughout the market gathering local Chinese people to use their phones for the assignment, Rob would sabotage the tablets to display lower amounts of money for the group to photograph.\n\n'''Parkeertarief:''' Rob was informed that the truck he was locked in with Leonie would cause the group to earn a maximum of \u20ac200,- if they did not get out. So he delayed solving their puzzle until the time ran out. Luckily a second truck did not complete their assignment, thus the group only managed to earn \u20ac20,- for the assignment.\n\n'''Beeldig:''' Rob placed himself in the group that had to search for envelopes in this assignment. His goal was to make sure neither group collected the correct envelopes. Directing his group to incorrect statues as quickly as he could to make sure Minus money would be collected. In one instance he took out money from one of the correct envelopes (and hid it in his hat) to further reduce the group's earnings from the assignment.\n\n'''Verkeer(d):''' With Nathan as Treasurer selecting the group's roles in the assignment, Rob lucked out into the Traffic Guide position where he could give false directions over the radio phones to the drivers when he felt like it. In such a powerful position, he managed to make sure to keep the pot low by making sure only 7 out of the 10 cars were correctly driven and parked for a mere \u20ac320,-. His poor \"Etherdiscipline\" aided in delaying and confusing the Candidates further throughout the assignment.\n\n'''Lettergreep:''' Aware of which letters had to be found for the second stage of the assignment, Rob ran the first stage as a fanatical candidate and found 4 letters and the Question Mark. As the W was not found, that reduced the potential earning, and during the second stage, he let Leonie take charge in searching for the remaining money without helping behind the scenes.\n\n'''Voice Mol:''' While Buddy took charge of the measuring for this assignment, Rob would be on the other end of the measuring tape, pulling the tape further than necessary to fudge the certain distances. Once all the phones were found, he made sure that a certain distance was one meter off to make sure the group never called Rik.\n\n'''Alles Kenners:''' Rob volunteered to enter the village first, so that he could switch the correct envelopes with wrong envelopes. Further sabotage was that he searched for the sand vials for the timer and dig holes in the ground to hide them from the group, meaning less time for Nathan to search for the correct envelopes he had already sabotaged.\n\n'''Mol Laser:''' Rob managed to hide throughout the laser tag field against most of the candidates, however, when it came down to Nathan's battle against him, Nathan's antics scared Rob until he chose to be taken out instead of being caught and unmasked. In the end of the assignment, Rob managed to take out \u20ac300.- from the group's pot.\n\n'''Scherp Stellen:''' Having memorized the 15 photographs required for the assignment beforehand, Rob made sure that the others didn't remember the correct instructions; causing only 4 out of the 15 photographs to be correct at the end of the assignment.\n\n'''Cijferkunst:''' Knowing that Nathan as the treasurer would have an influential role at the end of the assignment, Rob avoided pairing up with him. Paired up with Buddy, who wanted to bait Rob into sabotaging, he let Buddy bait him into giving Rik the wrong answer and causing the assignment to fail. It was the moment that Buddy finally locked onto Rob as the Mole, as the group's main suspect Leonie had just been executed from the game.\n\n'''Richtingsgevoel:''' Using a voice muffler over a phone, Rob tried to use reverse psychology against Nathan, to no avail. Leading to Nathan reclaiming the money he risked. With Miljuschka, he chose to build trust to bluff her later, however she too didn't fall for his tricks. Eventually, when he got to Buddy he managed to fool him out of \u20ac500.-, the eventual total in the assignment led up to \u20ac2,500.-, out of a potential \u20ac4,500.-.\n\n==Hidden Clues==\n'''Episode 1 - Afgeschermd:''' In ''Beltegoed'', Rob made sure to point out the \u20ac20.- to indicate that he was the 20th Mole.\n\n'''Episode 5 - Aangeraakt:''' The Candidates and audience could have spotted the Mole in ''Lezen en Schrijven''. One of the fans in the park said \"The Mole is here\" when Rob was on the screen searching.\n\n'''Episode Titles:''' The titles throughout the season pointed out to Rob's sabotages, Episode 2 ''Tegendraads'', which translates to contrary, is shown when the wires in ''Kleur Werk'' near Rob and Claes were in the contrary direction than where they should have been. ''Misleid'' (Mislead) pointed to Rob's role as the Traffic Guide misleading the drivers. ''Aangeraakt'' (Touched) had Rob literally touch the letters M, O, L, in that order during the ''Lettergreep'' assignment.\n\n'''Verkeer(d):''' During the beginning of the assignment, taking the first, second, third, and fourth letters of the first four road signs shown on screen, the letters M, O, L, R would spell out Mol R. A subtle suggestion that Rob was the Mole.\n\n'''Mol Laser:''' Rob's confessionals during this assignment were presented as the Mol talking to his opponents. And during his turn in the assignment he called out each of his opponents during the battle.\n\n'''Episode 6 - Voor Geen Meter:''' Rik's introduction monologue in this episode made a direct reference to one of Rob's tattoos. \"De Mol is tevreden.\" (The Mole is satisfied.) The words \"Tevreden\" is tattooed on Rob's shoulder, which is shown throughout the season.\n==Viewing Figures==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\"| Viewing Figures\n|-\n! #\n!

Recorded at Morgan studio in London 1974 Merrill played bass guitar on drummer [[Cozy Powell]]'s chart hit single \"The Man In Black\" and the B-side \"After Dark\" produced by Mickie Most on RAK records. The recording hit a peak position of No. 18 on the British charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alanmerrill.tumblr.com/post/58633001272/cozy-powell-the-man-in-black-sessions-1974-in|title=Cozy Powell, The Man In Black sessions|date=1974|website=Alanmerrill.tumblr.com|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith the Arrows Merrill sang three chart hit records as the band's lead singer, all produced by Mickie Most, \"Touch Too Much\" (No. 8 UK charts) \"Toughen Up\" (No. 51 UK charts) and \"My Last Night With You\" (No. 25 UK charts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicvf.com/Arrows.art|title=Arrows Songs \u2022 Top Songs/Chart Singles Discography \u2022 Music VF, US & UK hits charts|website=Musicvf.com|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> They made one more single that would be an important one. \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\" (1975), a song that started out as a B-side to the 45 rpm Arrows single \"[[Broken Down Heart]]\".

The show's producer [[Muriel Young]] was so impressed with the Arrows that she made a pitch to Granada [[ITV Network|ITV]] for them to have their own television series. The Arrows then got their own weekly TV series ''[[Arrows (TV series)|Arrows]]'' in 1976, taking over from the [[Bay City Rollers]] Granada TV series ''[[Shang-a-Lang (TV series)|Shang-a-Lang]]''. The Arrows signed with MAM Management. Their producer [[Mickie Most]] was so angry at the band for signing the management deal, that he vowed to never release another Arrows record. So it came to pass that Arrows had their own weekly television series and no records released during that time. Their ratings were so good that they got a second weekly series, but they released no new recordings. The Arrows disbanded shortly after the end of the second series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alanmerrill.tumblr.com/post/39427829851/the-arrows-enduring-legacy-from-bill-harrys|title=The Arrows Enduring Legacy \u2013 From Bill Harry's \"Rock N Pop Shop\"|website=Alanmerrill.com|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Merrill married fashion model [[Cathee Dahmen]], and formed a new group, the [[album-oriented rock]] act [[Runner (band)|Runner]], with [[Steve Gould (musician)|Steve Gould]] ([[Rare Bird]]), Mick Feat ([[Van Morrison]] band), and Dave Dowle ([[Whitesnake]]).

Recorded at Morgan studio in London 1974 Merrill played bass guitar on drummer [[Cozy Powell]]'s chart hit single \"The Man In Black\" and the B-side \"After Dark\" produced by Mickie Most on RAK records.

The show's producer [[Muriel Young]] was so impressed with the Arrows that she made a pitch to Granada [[ITV Network|ITV]] for them to have their own television series. The Arrows then got their own weekly TV series ''[[Arrows (TV series)|Arrows]]'' in 1976, taking over from the [[Bay City Rollers]] Granada TV series ''[[Shang-a-Lang (TV series)|Shang-a-Lang]]''. The Arrows signed with MAM Management. Their producer [[Mickie Most]] was so angry at the band for signing the management deal, that he vowed to never release another Arrows record. So it came to pass that Arrows had their own weekly television series and no records released during that time. Their ratings were so good that they got a second weekly series, but they released no new recordings.

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A March 30 paper by Imperial estimates that the lockdown will reduced the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\n==Response by sector==\n=== Government ===\n[[File:British Government NHS coronavirus public info poster.pdf|thumb|upright|English NHS coronavirus poster, February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2020/02/03/coronavirus-public-information-campaign-launched-across-the-uk/ |title=Coronavirus public information campaign launched across the UK |work=NHS England |date=3 February 2020 |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>]]\nGuidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.<ref name=\"Bosley26Feb2020\"/> In February, [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Adviser]] to the UK Government, [[Chris Whitty]] explained \"we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain;

Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A March 30 paper by Imperial estimates that the lockdown will reduced the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\n==Response by sector==\n=== Government ===\n[[File:British Government NHS coronavirus public info poster.pdf|thumb|upright|English NHS coronavirus poster, February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2020/02/03/coronavirus-public-information-campaign-launched-across-the-uk/ |title=Coronavirus public information campaign launched across the UK |work=NHS England |date=3 February 2020 |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>]]\nGuidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.<ref name=\"Bosley26Feb2020\"/> In February, [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Adviser]] to the UK Government, [[Chris Whitty]] explained \"we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain;
