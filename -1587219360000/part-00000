Larger asteroids have also been called '''planetoids'''. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the [[Sun]] that did not resolve into a disc in a telescope and was not observed to have characteristics of an active [[comet]] such as a tail. As [[Distant minor planet|minor planets in the outer Solar System]] were discovered that were found to have [[Volatiles|volatile]]-rich surfaces similar to comets, these came to be distinguished from the objects found in the main [[asteroid belt]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?asteroids |title=Asteroids |website=NASA{{Snd}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory |accessdate=13 September 2010}}</ref> In this article, the term \"asteroid\" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System, including those co-orbital with [[Jupiter]].\nOn 29 [[April]] A astroid named  [https://www.truthplaza.xyz/2020/04/will-everyone-die-on-29-april-2020-what.html?m=1 asteroid 52768] fall on earth.

However, other orbital families exist with significant populations, including the [[near-Earth object]]s. Individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic [[Emission spectrum|spectra]], with the majority falling into three main groups: [[C-type asteroid|C-type]], [[M-type asteroid|M-type]], and [[S-type asteroid|S-type]]. These were named after and are generally identified with [[Carbon|carbon-rich]], [[metal]]lic, and [[silicate]] (stony) compositions, respectively. The sizes of asteroids varies greatly; the largest, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], is almost {{cvt|1000|sigfig=1|km}} across and massive enough to qualify as a [[dwarf planet]].\n\nAsteroids are somewhat arbitrarily differentiated from [[comet]]s and [[meteoroid]]s. In the case of comets, the difference is one of composition: while asteroids are mainly composed of mineral and rock, comets are primarily composed of dust and ice. Furthermore, asteroids formed closer to the sun, preventing the development of cometary ice.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the difference between an asteroid and a comet?|url=http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/181-What-is-the-difference-between-an-asteroid-and-a-comet- |website=Cool Cosmos |publisher=Infrared Processing and Analysis Center |accessdate=13 August 2016}}</ref> The difference between asteroids and meteoroids is mainly one of size: meteoroids have a diameter of one meter or less, whereas asteroids have a diameter of greater than one meter.<ref name=Rubin2010>{{cite journal |last1=Rubin |first1=Alan E. |last2=Grossman |first2=Jeffrey N. |title=Meteorite and meteoroid: new comprehensive definitions |journal=Meteoritics and Planetary Science |date=January 2010 |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=114\u2013122 |bibcode=2010M&PS...45..114R |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.2009.01009.x |doi-access=free}}</ref> Finally, meteoroids can be composed of either cometary or asteroidal materials.<ref name=\"Universe Today\">{{cite web |title=What is the difference between asteroids and meteorites? |url=http://www.universetoday.com/36398/what-is-the-difference-between-asteroids-and-meteorites/ |website=Universe Today |last=Atkinson |first=Nancy |date=2 June 2015 |accessdate=13 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nOnly one asteroid, [[4 Vesta]], which has a relatively [[Albedo|reflective surface]], is normally visible to the naked eye, and this only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned.

After eight more years of fruitless searches, most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searches.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nHowever, [[Karl Ludwig Hencke]] persisted, and began searching for more asteroids in 1830. Fifteen years later, he found [[5 Astraea]], the first new asteroid in 38 years. He also found [[6 Hebe]] less than two years later. After this, other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that (except the wartime years 1944 and 1945).

This dramatically increased the rate of detection compared with earlier visual methods: Wolf alone discovered 248 asteroids, beginning with [[323 Brucia]], whereas only slightly more than 300 had been discovered up to that point.

The location would be measured relative to known star locations.<ref>{{cite web | last=Chapman | first=Mary G. | date=17 May 1992 | url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/About/People/CarolynShoemaker | title=Carolyn Shoemaker, Planetary Astronomer and Most Successful 'Comet Hunter' To Date | publisher=USGS | accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nThese first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery: the observer has only found an apparition, which gets a [[provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]], made up of the year of discovery, a letter representing the half-month of discovery, and finally a letter and a number indicating the discovery's sequential number (example: {{mp|1998 FJ|74}}).\n\nThe last step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to the [[Minor Planet Center]], where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit.

The U.S. military also declassified the information that its [[military satellite]]s, built to [[detect nuclear explosions]], had detected hundreds of upper-atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to ten meters across.\n\nAll these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient surveys that consist of charge-coupled device ([[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes. {{As of|2011}}, it was estimated that 89% to 96% of near-Earth asteroids one kilometer or larger in diameter had been discovered.<ref name=nasa_neo/> A list of teams using such systems includes:<ref>{{cite web\n | last=Yeomans | first=Don\n | url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/programs/\n | title=Near Earth Object Search Programs\n | publisher=NASA | accessdate=15 April 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080424093951/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/programs/| archivedate= 24 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n | url=https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/site_all.html\n | title=Discovery Statistics{{Snd}} by Survey (all)\n | publisher=NASA\n | access-date=27 December 2018\n | date=27 December 2018\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228041653/https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/site_all.html\n | archive-date=28 December 2018\n | url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] (LINEAR)\n* [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking]] (NEAT)\n* [[Spacewatch]]\n* [[LONEOS|Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search]] (LONEOS)\n* [[Catalina Sky Survey]] (CSS)\n* [[Pan-STARRS]]\n* [[NEOWISE]]\n* [[Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System]] (ATLAS)\n* [[Campo Imperatore Near-Earth Object Survey]] (CINEOS)\n* [[Japanese Spaceguard Association]]\n* [[Asiago-DLR Asteroid Survey]] (ADAS)\n\n{{as of|2018|10|29}}, the LINEAR system alone has discovered 147,132 asteroids.<ref>{{cite web |title=Minor Planet Discover Sites |website= International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center |accessdate=27 December 2018 |url=https://minorplanetcenter.net//iau/lists/MPDiscSites.html}}</ref> Among all the surveys, 19,266 near-Earth asteroids have been discovered<ref>{{cite web|url=https://minorplanetcenter.net//iau/lists/Unusual.html|title=Unusual Minor Planets|website=International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center|accessdate=27 December 2018}}<!--- using the \"close approach\" quote ---></ref> including almost 900 more than {{cvt|1|km|1}} in diameter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/totals.html|title=Discovery Statistics{{Snd}} Cumulative Totals|date=20 December 2018|access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Terminology{{anchor|Terminology}} == <!-- Linked from \"Comet\" -->\n[[File:Euler diagram of solar system bodies.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Euler diagram]] showing the types of bodies in the Solar System.

The main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to [[Outgassing|sublimation]] of near surface ices by solar radiation. A few objects have ended up being dual-listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity. Conversely, some (perhaps all) comets are eventually depleted of their surface [[volatiles|volatile ices]] and become asteroid-like.

Then, when the first [[trans-Neptunian object]] (other than [[Pluto]]), [[15760 Albion|Albion]], was discovered in 1992, and especially when large numbers of similar objects started turning up, new terms were invented to sidestep the issue: [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper-belt object]], [[trans-Neptunian object]], [[scattered-disc object]], and so on. These inhabit the cold outer reaches of the Solar System where ices remain solid and comet-like bodies are not expected to exhibit much cometary activity; if centaurs or trans-Neptunian objects were to venture close to the Sun, their volatile ices would sublimate, and traditional approaches would classify them as comets and not asteroids.\n\nThe innermost of these are the [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper-belt objects]], called \"objects\" partly to avoid the need to classify them as asteroids or comets.<ref name=KBOasteroids>{{cite news |url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=601 |title=Are Kuiper Belt Objects asteroids? |work=Ask an astronomer |publisher=Cornell University |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103110110/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=601 |archivedate=3 January 2009 }}</ref> They are thought to be predominantly comet-like in composition, though some may be more akin to asteroids.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect19/Sect19_22.html |author=Nicholas M.

The last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have. So far, every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile, a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume. The investigated asteroids are as large as 280&nbsp;km in diameter, and include [[121 Hermione]] (268\u00d7186\u00d7183&nbsp;km), and [[87 Sylvia]] (384\u00d7262\u00d7232&nbsp;km). Only half a dozen asteroids are [[List of notable asteroids#Largest by diameter|larger than 87 Sylvia]], though none of them have moons; however, some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive, suggesting they may not have been disrupted, and indeed [[511 Davida]], the same size as Sylvia to within measurement error, is estimated to be two and a half times as massive, though this is highly uncertain. The fact that such large asteroids as Sylvia can be rubble piles, presumably due to disruptive impacts, has important consequences for the formation of the Solar System: Computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging, but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge. This means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Icarus |volume=211 |issue=2 |date=February 2011 |pages=1022\u20131033 |title=Triplicity and physical characteristics of Asteroid (216) Kleopatra |display-authors=3 |first1=P. |last1=Descamps |first2=F. |last2=Marchis |first3=J. |last3=Berthier |first4=J.P. |last4=Emery |first5=G. |last5=Duch\u00eane |first6=I. |last6=de Pater |first7=M.H. |last7=Wong |first8=L. |last8=Lim |first9=H.B. |last9=Hammel |first10=F. |last10=Vachier |first11=P. |last11=Wiggins |first12=J.-P. |last12=Teng-Chuen-Yu |first13=A. |last13=Peyrot |first14=J. |last14=Pollock |first15=M. |last15=Assafin |first16=R. |last16=Vieira-Martinsa |first17=J.I.B. |last17=Camargoi |first18=F. |last18=Braga-Ribas |first19=B. |last19=Macomberk |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.11.016|arxiv=1011.5263 |bibcode=2011Icar..211.1022D }}</ref>\n\nOn 7 October 2009, the presence of [[ice|water ice]] was confirmed on the surface of [[24 Themis]] using [[NASA]]'s [[Infrared Telescope Facility]].

Apart from the broadest divisions, it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered. Groups are relatively loose dynamical associations, whereas families are tighter and result from the catastrophic break-up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past.<ref>{{cite journal\n |display-authors=3 | last=Zappal\u00e0 | first=V. |first2=Ph. |last2=Bendjoya |first3=A. |last3=Cellino |first4=P. |last4=Farinella |first5=C. |last5=Froeschl\u00e9\n | title=Asteroid families: Search of a 12,487-asteroid sample using two different clustering techniques\n | journal=Icarus | date=1995 | volume=116\n | issue=2 | pages=291\u2013314\n | bibcode=1995Icar..116..291Z\n | doi=10.1006/icar.1995.1127 }}</ref> Families are more common and easier to identify within the main asteroid belt, but several small families have been reported among the [[Jupiter trojan]]s.<ref name=\"Jewitt2004\">{{cite book |last=Jewitt |first=David C. |last2=Sheppard |first2=Scott |last3=Porco |first3=Carolyn |chapter=Jupiter's Outer Satellites and Trojans |title=Jupiter: The Planet, Satellites and Magnetosphere |date=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |editor=Bagenal, F. |editor2=Dowling, T.E. |editor3=McKinnon, W.B. |chapter-url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/users/sheppard/pub/Sheppard04JupChapter.pdf }}</ref> Main belt families were first recognized by [[Kiyotsugu Hirayama]] in 1918 and are often called [[Hirayama families]] in his honor.\n\nAbout 30\u201335% of the bodies in the asteroid belt belong to dynamical families each thought to have a common origin in a past collision between asteroids. A family has also been associated with the plutoid [[dwarf planet]] {{dp|Haumea}}.\n\n==== Quasi-satellites and horseshoe objects ====\nSome asteroids have unusual [[horseshoe orbit]]s that are co-orbital with [[Earth]] or some other planet. Examples are [[3753 Cruithne]] and {{mpl|2002 AA|29}}. The first instance of this type of orbital arrangement was discovered between [[Saturn]]'s moons [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]] and [[Janus (moon)|Janus]].\n\nSometimes these horseshoe objects temporarily become [[quasi-satellite]]s for a few decades or a few hundred years, before returning to their earlier status. Both Earth and [[Venus]] are known to have quasi-satellites.\n\nSuch objects, if associated with Earth or Venus or even hypothetically [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], are a special class of [[Aten asteroid]]s. However, such objects could be associated with outer planets as well.\n\n=== Spectral classification ===\n{{Main|Asteroid spectral types}}\n[[File:433eros.jpg|thumb|This picture of [[433 Eros]] shows the view looking from one end of the asteroid across the gouge on its underside and toward the opposite end. Features as small as {{cvt|35|m|0}} across can be seen.]]\nIn 1975, an asteroid [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] system based on [[color]], [[albedo]], and [[spectral line|spectral shape]] was developed by [[Clark R. Chapman]], [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]], and [[Ben Zellner]].<ref>{{cite journal | first=C.R. | last=Chapman | title=Surface properties of asteroids: A synthesis of polarimetry, radiometry, and spectrophotometry | journal=Icarus | volume=25 | issue=1 | pages=104\u2013130 | bibcode=1975Icar...25..104C | date=1975 | doi=10.1016/0019-1035(75)90191-8 | last2=Morrison | first2=David | last3=Zellner | first3=Ben}}</ref> These properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroid's surface material. The original classification system had three categories: [[C-type asteroid|C-types]] for dark carbonaceous objects (75% of known asteroids), [[S-type asteroid|S-types]] for stony (silicaceous) objects (17% of known asteroids) and U for those that did not fit into either C or S. This classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types. The number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied.\n\nThe two most widely used taxonomies now used are the [[Tholen classification]] and [[SMASS classification]]. The former was proposed in 1984 by [[David J. Tholen]], and was based on data collected from an eight-color asteroid survey performed in the 1980s. This resulted in 14 asteroid categories.<ref>{{cite conference | last=Tholen | first=D.J. | title=Asteroid taxonomic classifications | booktitle=Asteroids II; Proceedings of the Conference | pages=1139\u20131150 | publisher=University of Arizona Press | date=1989 | bibcode=1989aste.conf.1139T}}</ref> In 2002, the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey resulted in a modified version of the Tholen taxonomy with 24 different types. Both systems have three broad categories of C, S, and X asteroids, where X consists of mostly metallic asteroids, such as the [[M-type asteroid|M-type]]. There are also several smaller classes.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bus | first=S.J. | title=Phase II of the Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectroscopy Survey: A feature-based taxonomy | journal=Icarus | date=2002 | volume=158 | issue=1 | page=146 | doi=10.1006/icar.2002.6856 | bibcode=2002Icar..158..146B| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7332ce5163551b5ad96203e710f02ede89a832d9 }}</ref>\n\nThe proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type; some types are easier to detect than others, biasing the totals.\n\n==== Problems ====\nOriginally, spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid's composition.<ref>{{cite book | first=Harry Y. | last=McSween Jr. | date=1999 | title=Meteorites and their Parent Planets | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-521-58751-8 }}</ref> However, the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good, and a variety of classifications are in use. This has led to significant confusion. Although asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials, there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials.\n\n== Naming ==\n{{Main|Minor planet#Naming}}\n[[File:Asteroid20130318-full.jpg|thumb|right|[[2013 EC]], shown here in radar images, has a provisional designation]]\nA newly discovered asteroid is given a [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] (such as {{mpl|2002 AT|4}}) consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code indicating the [[half-month]] of discovery and the sequence within that half-month. Once an asteroid's orbit has been confirmed, it is given a number, and later may also be given a name (e.g. [[433 Eros]]). The formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number (e.g. (433) Eros), but dropping the parentheses is quite common. Informally, it is common to drop the number altogether, or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Naming of Asteroids|url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/science/physics-and-astronomy/astronomy/the-naming-asteroids|website=Open Learn|publisher=The Open University|accessdate=14 August 2016}}</ref> In addition, names can be proposed by the asteroid's discoverer, within guidelines established by the International Astronomical Union.<ref>{{cite web|title=Asteroid Naming Guidelines|url=http://www.planetary.org/get-involved/contests/osirisrex/guidelines.html|website=The Planetary Society|publisher=The Planetary Society|accessdate=14 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Symbols ===\n{{main|Astronomical symbols}}\nThe first asteroids to be discovered were assigned iconic symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate the planets.

He introduced a disk (circle), a traditional symbol for a star, as the generic symbol for an asteroid. The circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid (although he assigned \u2460 to the fifth, [[5 Astraea|Astraea]], while continuing to designate the first four only with their existing iconic symbols). The numbered-circle convention was quickly adopted by astronomers, and the next asteroid to be discovered ([[16 Psyche]], in 1852) was the first to be designated in that way at the time of its discovery. However, Psyche was given an iconic symbol as well, as were a few other asteroids discovered over the next few years (see chart above). [[20 Massalia]] was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol, and no iconic symbols were created after the 1855 discovery of [[37 Fides]].<ref group=note>Except for Pluto and, in the astrological community, for a few outer bodies such as [[2060 Chiron]]</ref> That year Astraea's number was increased to \u2464, but the first four asteroids, Ceres to Vesta, were not listed by their numbers until the 1867 edition. The circle was soon abbreviated to a pair of parentheses, which were easier to typeset and sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades, leading to the modern convention.<ref name=\"hilton\"/>\n\n== Exploration ==\n{{see also|Sample return mission|Asteroid mining|Colonization of the asteroids}}\n[[File:Eros rotation Dec. 3-4 2000.gif|thumb|Eros as seen by visiting spacecraft]]\nUntil the age of [[Spaceflight|space travel]], objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery. The best modern ground-based telescopes and the Earth-orbiting [[Hubble Space Telescope]] can resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids, but even these mostly remain little more than fuzzy blobs. Limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their [[light curve]]s (their variation in brightness as they rotate) and their spectral properties, and asteroid sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occulations (when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star). [[Radar]] imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters, especially for near-Earth asteroids. In terms of [[delta-v]] and propellant requirements, NEOs are more easily accessible than the Moon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/project/neo/pdf/NEO_feasibility.pdf |title=A Piloted Orion Flight to a Near-Earth Object: A Feasibility Study |display-authors=3 |author1=Rob R.

These images revealed the irregular, potato-like shapes of most asteroids, as did later images from the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes of the small moons of the [[gas giant]]s.\n\nThe first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was [[951 Gaspra]] in 1991, followed in 1993 by [[243 Ida]] and its moon [[Dactyl (asteroid)|Dactyl]], all of which were imaged by the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' probe]] en route to [[Jupiter]].\n\nThe first dedicated asteroid probe was ''[[NEAR Shoemaker]]'', which photographed [[253 Mathilde]] in 1997, before entering into orbit around [[433 Eros]], finally landing on its surface in 2001.\n\nOther asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include [[9969 Braille]] (by ''[[Deep Space 1]]'' in 1999), and [[5535 Annefrank]] (by ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' in 2002).\n\nFrom September to November 2005, the Japanese ''[[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|Hayabusa]]'' probe studied [[25143 Itokawa]] in detail and was plagued with difficulties, but [[Sample return mission|returned samples]] of its surface to Earth on 13 June 2010.\n\nThe European [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''Rosetta'' probe]] (launched

Larger asteroids have also been called '''planetoids'''. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the [[Sun]] that did not resolve into a disc in a telescope and was not observed to have characteristics of an active [[comet]] such as a tail. As [[Distant minor planet|minor planets in the outer Solar System]] were discovered that were found to have [[Volatiles|volatile]]-rich surfaces similar to comets, these came to be distinguished from the objects found in the main [[asteroid belt]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?asteroids |title=Asteroids |website=NASA{{Snd}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory |accessdate=13 September 2010}}</ref> In this article, the term \"asteroid\" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System, including those co-orbital with [[Jupiter]].\n\nThere exist millions of asteroids, many the shattered remnants of [[planetesimal]]s, bodies within the young Sun's [[solar nebula]] that never grew large enough to become [[planet]]s.<ref>{{cite web |website=CNEOS |title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs){{Snd}} What Are Asteroids And Comets? |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/#ast |accessdate=13 September 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100909210213/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/ |archivedate= 9 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The vast majority of known asteroids orbit within the main asteroid belt located between the orbits of [[Mars]] and Jupiter, or are co-orbital with Jupiter (the [[Jupiter trojan]]s). However, other orbital families exist with significant populations, including the [[near-Earth object]]s. Individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic [[Emission spectrum|spectra]], with the majority falling into three main groups: [[C-type asteroid|C-type]], [[M-type asteroid|M-type]], and [[S-type asteroid|S-type]]. These were named after and are generally identified with [[Carbon|carbon-rich]], [[metal]]lic, and [[silicate]] (stony) compositions, respectively. The sizes of asteroids varies greatly; the largest, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], is almost {{cvt|1000|sigfig=1|km}} across and massive enough to qualify as a [[dwarf planet]].\n\nAsteroids are somewhat arbitrarily differentiated from [[comet]]s and [[meteoroid]]s. In the case of comets, the difference is one of composition: while asteroids are mainly composed of mineral and rock, comets are primarily composed of dust and ice. Furthermore, asteroids formed closer to the sun, preventing the development of cometary ice.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the difference between an asteroid and a comet?|url=http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/181-What-is-the-difference-between-an-asteroid-and-a-comet- |website=Cool Cosmos |publisher=Infrared Processing and Analysis Center |accessdate=13 August 2016}}</ref> The difference between asteroids and meteoroids is mainly one of size: meteoroids have a diameter of one meter or less, whereas asteroids have a diameter of greater than one meter.<ref name=Rubin2010>{{cite journal |last1=Rubin |first1=Alan E. |last2=Grossman |first2=Jeffrey N. |title=Meteorite and meteoroid: new comprehensive definitions |journal=Meteoritics and Planetary Science |date=January 2010 |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=114\u2013122 |bibcode=2010M&PS...45..114R |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.2009.01009.x |doi-access=free}}</ref> Finally, meteoroids can be composed of either cometary or asteroidal materials.<ref name=\"Universe Today\">{{cite web |title=What is the difference between asteroids and meteorites? |url=http://www.universetoday.com/36398/what-is-the-difference-between-asteroids-and-meteorites/ |website=Universe Today |last=Atkinson |first=Nancy |date=2 June 2015 |accessdate=13 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nOnly one asteroid, [[4 Vesta]], which has a relatively [[Albedo|reflective surface]], is normally visible to the naked eye, and this only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned.

After eight more years of fruitless searches, most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searches.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nHowever, [[Karl Ludwig Hencke]] persisted, and began searching for more asteroids in 1830. Fifteen years later, he found [[5 Astraea]], the first new asteroid in 38 years. He also found [[6 Hebe]] less than two years later. After this, other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that (except the wartime years 1944 and 1945).

First, a region of the sky was [[Astrophotography|photographed]] by a wide-field [[telescope]], or [[astrograph]]. Pairs of photographs were taken, typically one hour apart. Multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days. Second, the two films or [[photographic plate|plates]] of the same region were viewed under a [[stereoscope]]. Any body in orbit around the Sun would move slightly between the pair of films. Under the stereoscope, the image of the body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars. Third, once a moving body was identified, its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope. The location would be measured relative to known star locations.<ref>{{cite web | last=Chapman | first=Mary G. | date=17 May 1992 | url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/About/People/CarolynShoemaker | title=Carolyn Shoemaker, Planetary Astronomer and Most Successful 'Comet Hunter' To Date | publisher=USGS | accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nThese first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery: the observer has only found an apparition, which gets a [[provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]], made up of the year of discovery, a letter representing the half-month of discovery, and finally a letter and a number indicating the discovery's sequential number (example: {{mp|1998 FJ|74}}).\n\nThe last step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to the [[Minor Planet Center]], where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit. If so, the object receives a catalogue number and the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer, and granted the honor of naming the object subject to the approval of the [[International Astronomical Union]].\n\n=== Computerized methods ===\n[[File:Asteroid 2004 FH.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|[[2004 FH]] is the center dot being followed by the sequence; the object that flashes by during the clip is an [[satellite|artificial satellite]].]]\n[[File:Known NEAs.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Cumulative discoveries of just the near-Earth asteroids known by size, 1980\u20132017]]\nThere is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross [[Earth]]'s, and that could, given enough time, collide with Earth ''(see [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|Earth-crosser asteroids]])''.

In order of discovery, these were: [[1221 Amor]], [[1862 Apollo]], [[2101 Adonis]], and finally [[69230 Hermes]], which approached within 0.005&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] of [[Earth]] in 1937. Astronomers began to realize the possibilities of Earth impact.\n\nTwo events in later decades increased the alarm: the increasing acceptance of the [[Alvarez hypothesis]] that an [[impact event]] resulted in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction]], and the 1994 observation of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] crashing into [[Jupiter]]. The U.S. military also declassified the information that its [[military satellite]]s, built to [[detect nuclear explosions]], had detected hundreds of upper-atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to ten meters across.\n\nAll these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient surveys that consist of charge-coupled device ([[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes. {{As of|2011}}, it was estimated that 89% to 96% of near-Earth asteroids one kilometer or larger in diameter had been discovered.<ref name=nasa_neo/> A list of teams using such systems includes:<ref>{{cite web\n | last=Yeomans | first=Don\n | url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/programs/\n | title=Near Earth Object Search Programs\n | publisher=NASA | accessdate=15 April 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080424093951/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/programs/| archivedate= 24 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n | url=https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/site_all.html\n | title=Discovery Statistics{{Snd}} by Survey (all)\n | publisher=NASA\n | access-date=27 December 2018\n | date=27 December 2018\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228041653/https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/site_all.html\n | archive-date=28 December 2018\n | url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] (LINEAR)\n* [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking]] (NEAT)\n* [[Spacewatch]]\n* [[LONEOS|Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search]] (LONEOS)\n* [[Catalina Sky Survey]] (CSS)\n* [[Pan-STARRS]]\n* [[NEOWISE]]\n* [[Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System]] (ATLAS)\n* [[Campo Imperatore Near-Earth Object Survey]] (CINEOS)\n* [[Japanese Spaceguard Association]]\n* [[Asiago-DLR Asteroid Survey]] (ADAS)\n\n{{as of|2018|10|29}}, the LINEAR system alone has discovered 147,132 asteroids.<ref>{{cite web |title=Minor Planet Discover Sites |website= International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center |accessdate=27 December 2018 |url=https://minorplanetcenter.net//iau/lists/MPDiscSites.html}}</ref> Among all the surveys, 19,266 near-Earth asteroids have been discovered<ref>{{cite web|url=https://minorplanetcenter.net//iau/lists/Unusual.html|title=Unusual Minor Planets|website=International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center|accessdate=27 December 2018}}<!--- using the \"close approach\" quote ---></ref> including almost 900 more than {{cvt|1|km|1}} in diameter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/totals.html|title=Discovery Statistics{{Snd}} Cumulative Totals|date=20 December 2018|access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Terminology{{anchor|Terminology}} == <!-- Linked from \"Comet\" -->\n[[File:Euler diagram of solar system bodies.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Euler diagram]] showing the types of bodies in the Solar System.

The main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to [[Outgassing|sublimation]] of near surface ices by solar radiation. A few objects have ended up being dual-listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity. Conversely, some (perhaps all) comets are eventually depleted of their surface [[volatiles|volatile ices]] and become asteroid-like. A further distinction is that comets typically have more eccentric orbits than most asteroids; most \"asteroids\" with notably eccentric orbits are probably dormant or extinct comets.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Weissman, Paul R.|author2= Bottke, William F.

Although fewer Jupiter trojans have been discovered ({{as of|2010}}), it is thought that they are as numerous as the asteroids in the asteroid belt.

The vast majority, however, are much smaller and are irregularly shaped; they are thought to be either battered [[planetesimal]]s or fragments of larger bodies.\n\nThe [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] is by far the largest asteroid, with a diameter of {{cvt|940|km|-1}}. The next largest are [[4 Vesta]] and [[2 Pallas]], both with diameters of just over {{cvt|500|km|-2}}. Vesta is the only main-belt asteroid that can, on occasion, be visible to the naked eye. On some rare occasions, a near-Earth asteroid may briefly become visible without technical aid; see [[99942 Apophis]].\n\nThe mass of all the objects of the [[asteroid belt]], lying between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], is estimated to be in the range of {{val|2.8|-|3.2|e=21|u=kg}}, about 4% of the mass of the Moon. Of this, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] comprises {{val|.938|e=21|u=kg}}, about a third of the total. Adding in the next three most massive objects, [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (9%), [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] (7%), and [[10 Hygiea|Hygiea]] (3%), brings this figure up to half, whereas the three most-massive asteroids after that, [[511 Davida]] (1.2%), [[704 Interamnia]] (1.0%), and [[52 Europa]] (0.9%), constitute only another 3%. The number of asteroids increases rapidly as their individual masses decrease.\n\nThe number of asteroids decreases markedly with size. Although this generally follows a [[power law]], there are 'bumps' at {{val|5|u=km}} and {{val|100|u=km}}, where more asteroids than expected from a [[logarithmic distribution]] are found.<ref>Davis (2002) ''Asteroids III'', cited by {{cite web |url=http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/ivezic/Astr598/lecture4.pdf |title=Lecture 4: Moving Objects Detected by SDSS |first=\u017deljko |last=Ivezi\u0107 |date=2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720111753/http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/ivezic/Astr598/lecture4.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n! colspan=\"15\" style=\"background:#ddd; text-align:center;\"| Approximate number of asteroids (N) larger than a certain diameter (D)\n|-\n!D\n| 0.1&nbsp;km || 0.3&nbsp;km || 0.5&nbsp;km || 1&nbsp;km || 3&nbsp;km || 5&nbsp;km || 10&nbsp;km || 30&nbsp;km || 50&nbsp;km || 100&nbsp;km || 200&nbsp;km || 300&nbsp;km || 500&nbsp;km || 900&nbsp;km\n|-\n!N\n| {{val|25000000}} || {{val|4000000}} || {{val|2000000}} || {{val|750000}} || {{val|200000}} || {{val|90000}} || {{val|10000}} || {{val|1100}} || 600 || 200 || 30 || 5 || 3 || 1\n|}\n\n====Largest asteroids====\n[[File:The Four Largest Asteroids.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The four largest asteroids: 1 Ceres, 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas and 10 Hygiea]]\n{{See also|Largest asteroids}}\nAlthough their location in the asteroid belt excludes them from planet status, the three largest objects, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], and [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], are intact [[protoplanet]]s that share many characteristics common to planets, and are atypical compared to the majority of irregularly-shaped asteroids.

The last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have. So far, every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile, a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume. The investigated asteroids are as large as 280&nbsp;km in diameter, and include [[121 Hermione]] (268\u00d7186\u00d7183&nbsp;km), and [[87 Sylvia]] (384\u00d7262\u00d7232&nbsp;km). Only half a dozen asteroids are [[List of notable asteroids#Largest by diameter|larger than 87 Sylvia]], though none of them have moons; however, some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive, suggesting they may not have been disrupted, and indeed [[511 Davida]], the same size as Sylvia to within measurement error, is estimated to be two and a half times as massive, though this is highly uncertain. The fact that such large asteroids as Sylvia can be rubble piles, presumably due to disruptive impacts, has important consequences for the formation of the Solar System: Computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging, but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge. This means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Icarus |volume=211 |issue=2 |date=February 2011 |pages=1022\u20131033 |title=Triplicity and physical characteristics of Asteroid (216) Kleopatra |display-authors=3 |first1=P. |last1=Descamps |first2=F. |last2=Marchis |first3=J. |last3=Berthier |first4=J.P. |last4=Emery |first5=G. |last5=Duch\u00eane |first6=I. |last6=de Pater |first7=M.H. |last7=Wong |first8=L. |last8=Lim |first9=H.B. |last9=Hammel |first10=F. |last10=Vachier |first11=P. |last11=Wiggins |first12=J.-P. |last12=Teng-Chuen-Yu |first13=A. |last13=Peyrot |first14=J. |last14=Pollock |first15=M. |last15=Assafin |first16=R. |last16=Vieira-Martinsa |first17=J.I.B. |last17=Camargoi |first18=F. |last18=Braga-Ribas |first19=B. |last19=Macomberk |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.11.016|arxiv=1011.5263 |bibcode=2011Icar..211.1022D }}</ref>\n\nOn 7 October 2009, the presence of [[ice|water ice]] was confirmed on the surface of [[24 Themis]] using [[NASA]]'s [[Infrared Telescope Facility]].

This classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types. The number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied.\n\nThe two most widely used taxonomies now used are the [[Tholen classification]] and [[SMASS classification]]. The former was proposed in 1984 by [[David J. Tholen]], and was based on data collected from an eight-color asteroid survey performed in the 1980s. This resulted in 14 asteroid categories.<ref>{{cite conference | last=Tholen | first=D.J. | title=Asteroid taxonomic classifications | booktitle=Asteroids II; Proceedings of the Conference | pages=1139\u20131150 | publisher=University of Arizona Press | date=1989 | bibcode=1989aste.conf.1139T}}</ref> In 2002, the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey resulted in a modified version of the Tholen taxonomy with 24 different types. Both systems have three broad categories of C, S, and X asteroids, where X consists of mostly metallic asteroids, such as the [[M-type asteroid|M-type]]. There are also several smaller classes.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bus | first=S.J. | title=Phase II of the Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectroscopy Survey: A feature-based taxonomy | journal=Icarus | date=2002 | volume=158 | issue=1 | page=146 | doi=10.1006/icar.2002.6856 | bibcode=2002Icar..158..146B| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7332ce5163551b5ad96203e710f02ede89a832d9 }}</ref>\n\nThe proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type; some types are easier to detect than others, biasing the totals.\n\n==== Problems ====\nOriginally, spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid's composition.<ref>{{cite book | first=Harry Y. | last=McSween Jr. | date=1999 | title=Meteorites and their Parent Planets | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-521-58751-8 }}</ref> However, the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good, and a variety of classifications are in use. This has led to significant confusion. Although asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials, there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials.\n\n== Naming ==\n{{Main|Minor planet#Naming}}\n[[File:Asteroid20130318-full.jpg|thumb|right|[[2013 EC]], shown here in radar images, has a provisional designation]]\nA newly discovered asteroid is given a [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] (such as {{mpl|2002 AT|4}}) consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code indicating the [[half-month]] of discovery and the sequence within that half-month. Once an asteroid's orbit has been confirmed, it is given a number, and later may also be given a name (e.g. [[433 Eros]]). The formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number (e.g. (433) Eros), but dropping the parentheses is quite common. Informally, it is common to drop the number altogether, or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Naming of Asteroids|url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/science/physics-and-astronomy/astronomy/the-naming-asteroids|website=Open Learn|publisher=The Open University|accessdate=14 August 2016}}</ref> In addition, names can be proposed by the asteroid's discoverer, within guidelines established by the International Astronomical Union.<ref>{{cite web|title=Asteroid Naming Guidelines|url=http://www.planetary.org/get-involved/contests/osirisrex/guidelines.html|website=The Planetary Society|publisher=The Planetary Society|accessdate=14 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Symbols ===\n{{main|Astronomical symbols}}\nThe first asteroids to be discovered were assigned iconic symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate the planets.

He introduced a disk (circle), a traditional symbol for a star, as the generic symbol for an asteroid. The circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid (although he assigned \u2460 to the fifth, [[5 Astraea|Astraea]], while continuing to designate the first four only with their existing iconic symbols). The numbered-circle convention was quickly adopted by astronomers, and the next asteroid to be discovered ([[16 Psyche]], in 1852) was the first to be designated in that way at the time of its discovery. However, Psyche was given an iconic symbol as well, as were a few other asteroids discovered over the next few years (see chart above). [[20 Massalia]] was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol, and no iconic symbols were created after the 1855 discovery of [[37 Fides]].<ref group=note>Except for Pluto and, in the astrological community, for a few outer bodies such as [[2060 Chiron]]</ref> That year Astraea's number was increased to \u2464, but the first four asteroids, Ceres to Vesta, were not listed by their numbers until the 1867 edition. The circle was soon abbreviated to a pair of parentheses, which were easier to typeset and sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades, leading to the modern convention.<ref name=\"hilton\"/>\n\n== Exploration ==\n{{see also|Sample return mission|Asteroid mining|Colonization of the asteroids}}\n[[File:Eros rotation Dec. 3-4 2000.gif|thumb|Eros as seen by visiting spacecraft]]\nUntil the age of [[Spaceflight|space travel]], objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery. The best modern ground-based telescopes and the Earth-orbiting [[Hubble Space Telescope]] can resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids, but even these mostly remain little more than fuzzy blobs. Limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their [[light curve]]s (their variation in brightness as they rotate) and their spectral properties, and asteroid sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occulations (when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star). [[Radar]] imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters, especially for near-Earth asteroids. In terms of [[delta-v]] and propellant requirements, NEOs are more easily accessible than the Moon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/project/neo/pdf/NEO_feasibility.pdf |title=A Piloted Orion Flight to a Near-Earth Object: A Feasibility Study |display-authors=3 |author1=Rob R.

These images revealed the irregular, potato-like shapes of most asteroids, as did later images from the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes of the small moons of the [[gas giant]]s.\n\nThe first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was [[951 Gaspra]] in 1991, followed in 1993 by [[243 Ida]] and its moon [[Dactyl (asteroid)|Dactyl]], all of which were imaged by the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' probe]] en route to [[Jupiter]].\n\nThe first dedicated asteroid probe was ''[[NEAR Shoemaker]]'', which photographed [[253 Mathilde]] in 1997, before entering into orbit around [[433 Eros]], finally landing on its surface in 2001.\n\nOther asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include [[9969 Braille]] (by ''[[Deep Space 1]]'' in 1999), and [[5535 Annefrank]] (by ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' in 2002).\n\nFrom September to November 2005, the Japanese ''[[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|Hayabusa]]'' probe studied [[25143 Itokawa]] in

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state.

Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]].

Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

In the 19th century, oystering boomed in New Haven, Bridgeport, and Norwalk and achieved modest success in neighboring towns.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state.

Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

In the 19th century, oystering boomed in New Haven, Bridgeport, and Norwalk and achieved modest success in neighboring towns.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.
