Commissioner''''' is an opinion from the [[United States Tax Court]] that holds that a taxpayer cannot avoid paying taxes on the sale of property by first conveying that property to someone else. This opinion was later affirmed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]. This case outlines some limitations on the \"fruit-and-tree\" metaphor established in ''[[Lucas v. Earl]]'', 281 U.S. 111 (1930) and further developed in ''[[Helvering v. Horst]]'', 311 U.S. 112 (1940). Decided in 1970, the case arose when a taxpayer tried to avoid paying [[Capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains tax]] from sale of property by giving a share in that property to her children. She then paid a [[gift tax]], which is significantly less than the tax on the gain would have been if she had not given a share to her children.\n\n== Background ==\nPrior to his death on October 7, 1948, Susie Salvatore's husband owned and operated a [[gas station]] in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. Upon his death, his entire estate was bequeathed to his wife. For the next several years, Susie Salvatore, her three sons, and one of her two daughters operated the gas station.\n\nAs time passed, several of the Salvatore children moved on while the land on which the gas station was located became increasingly valuable, to the point where several oil companies made offers to purchase the property. The family rejected several proposals, until in the summer of 1963, [[Texaco, Inc.]] made a proposal to purchase the land for $295,000.<ref name=\"ustc_ruling\">''Salvatore v. Commissioner'', [https://www.leagle.com/decision/197011829adtcm89189 T.C. Memo 1970-30]; 29 [[CCH (company)|T.C.M. (CCH)]] 89; RIA T.C. Memo \u00b6 70030 (1970).</ref>\n\nTo ensure Susie Salvatore's accustomed weekly stipend (received from the operation of the gas station), she was to receive $100,000 of the proceeds. The remainder was to be divided amongst her children. To effectuate this, petitioner conveyed a one-half interest in the property to the children and the deeds would be executed by the children and petitioner when conveying the property to Texaco.\n\nOn July 24, 1963, the Salvatore family formally accepted the offer from Texaco. Not until August 28, 1963, however, was a [[warranty deed]] conveying an undivided one-half interest in the property to her five children executed. On that same date, warranty deeds were executed conveying the property to Texaco, at which point Texaco paid the balance of the purchase price (less the $50,000 mortgage).\n\nIn 1963, Susie Salvatore then filed a Federal [[gift tax]] return reporting gifts of 1/10 interest in the property to each of the five children. In her [[income tax]] return for that year, she only reported her share of the gain from the sale of the gas station as a long-term [[capital gain]] plus a small [[ordinary income|ordinary gain]]. The children reported their respective shares on their income tax forms as well.\n\nThe [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue]] contested that the entire gain on the sale of the property was taxable as a long-term capital gain, a tax much higher than the gift tax paid by Susie Salvatore.\n\n==Holding==\nThe [[United States Tax Court]] ruled that the petitioner, Susie Salvatore, was taxable on all of the gain realized on the sale of the gas station.\n\nThe Tax Court ruled that this decision was subject to the [[legal precedent|precedent]] set in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Commissioner v. Court Holding Co.]]'', in which the Supreme Court stated:\n\n<blockquote>The incidence of taxation depends upon the substance of a transaction. The tax consequences which arise from gains from a sale of property are not finally to be determined solely by the means employed to transfer legal title. Rather, the transaction must be viewed as a whole, and each step, from the commencement of negotiations to the consummation of the sale is relevant. A sale by one person cannot be transformed for tax purposes into a sale by another by using the latter as a conduit through which to pass title. To permit the true nature of a transaction to be disguised by mere formalisms, which exist solely to alter tax liabilities, would seriously impair the effective administration of the tax policies of Congress.<ref>{{ussc|name=Commissioner v. Court Holding Co.|link=|volume=324|page=331|pin=|year=1945}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Tax Court viewed the petitioner's children as \"conduit's through which to pass title\" and stated that, \"the form of a transaction cannot be permitted to prevail over its substance. In substance, petitioner made an anticipatory assignment to her children of one-half of the income from the sale of the property.\" On a similar note, \"[H]er tax liabilities cannot be altered by a rearrangement of the legal title after she had already contracted to sell the property to Texaco.\"<ref name=\"ustc_ruling\" />\n\nSusie Salvatore later appealed this decision.\n\nOn appeal, the ruling made by the United States Tax Court was affirmed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] on the grounds that the tax court was not clearly erroneous.

Based on his time at [[Indian Springs School]]<nowiki/>, Green wrote the novel as a result of his desire to create meaningful [[young adult fiction]].<ref name=\":7\" /> The characters and events of the plot are grounded in Green's life, while the story itself is fictional.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n''Looking for Alaska'' follows the novel's main character and narrator Miles Halter, or \"Pudge,\" to boarding school where he goes to seek the \"Great Perhaps,\" the famous last words of [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]]. Throughout the first half of the novel, Miles and his friends Chip \"The Colonel\" Martin, Alaska Young, and Takumi Hikohito grow very close and the section culminates in Alaska's death. In the second half of the novel, Miles and his friends work to discover the missing details of the night Alaska died. While struggling to reconcile Alaska's death, Miles grapples with  Sim\u00f3n Bolivar's last words and the meaning of life, leaving the conclusion to these topics unresolved.\n\n''Looking for Alaska'' is a coming-of-age novel that touches on themes of meaning, grief, hope, and youth-adult relationships. The novel won the 2006 [[Michael L. Printz Award]] from the [[American Library Association]], and led the association's list of most-challenged books in 2015 due to profanity and a sexually explicit scene.<ref name=\":8\" /> Schools in Kentucky, Tennessee, and several other states have attempted to place bans on the book.

His parents agreed, and he spent the remainder of his time in high school at Indian Springs School forming valuable relationships with teachers, relationships that Green says still exist today.<ref name=\":0\" /> Green's experience at boarding school inspired him to write ''Looking for Alaska.'' Many of the characters and events that take place in the novel are based on what Green experienced at Indian Springs,<ref name=\":0\" /> including the death of a central character in the novel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&id=GALE%7CA131082448&v=2.1&it=r&sid=LitRC&asid=be97446d |title=Last Words From a First Novelist |last=Cooper |first=Ilene |access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>\n\nDuring a [[book talk]] at [[Rivermont Collegiate]] on October 19, 2006, Green shared that the idea of Takumi's \"fox hat\" in ''Looking for Alaska'' originated from a Filipino friend who wore a similar hat while playing pranks at the school. He also noted that his inspiration for the possessed swan in Culver Creek derived from a similar swan he remembers at Indian Springs. The two pranks that occur in the book are similar to pranks that Green pulled at school, but Green emphasizes that while the setting is based on his life, the novel is entirely fictional.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JLuF8GmtH4|title=John Green's Legendary High School Prank|date=8 December 2007|work=YouTube|accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs a child, Green became infatuated with famous last words, specifically those of [[John Adams]].

Alaska sets Pudge up with a Romanian classmate, Lara. Unfortunately, Pudge and Lara have a disastrous date, ending with a concussed Pudge throwing up on Lara. Alaska and Pudge grow closer and he begins to fall in love with her, although she insists on keeping their relationship [[Platonic love|platonic]] because she has a boyfriend at [[Vanderbilt University]] whom she insists she loves.\n\nOn his first night at Culver Creek, Pudge is kidnapped and thrown into a lake by the \"Weekday Warriors,\" a group of rich schoolmates who blame the Colonel and his friends for the expulsion of their friend, Paul. Paul's expulsion created tension between Pudge's friends and the Weekday Warriors. Takumi claims that they are innocent because their friend Marya was also [[expulsion (education)#United States and Canada|expelled]] during the incident.  However, Alaska later admits that she told on both Marya and Paul to the dean, Mr. Starnes, to save herself from being expelled.\n\nThe gang celebrates a successful series of pranks by drinking and partying, and an inebriated Alaska confides about her mother's death from an [[aneurysm]] when she was eight years old. Although she didn't understand at the time, she feels guilty for not calling 911. Pudge figures that her mother's death made Alaska impulsive and rash. He concludes that the labyrinth was a person's suffering and that humans must try to find their way out. Afterwards, Pudge grows closer to Lara, and they start dating. A week later, after another 'celebration', an intoxicated Alaska and Pudge spend the night with each other, when suddenly Alaska receives a phone call which causes her to go into hysterics. Insisting that she has to leave, Alaska drives away while drunk with Pudge and the Colonel distracting Mr. Starnes. They later learn that Alaska was [[driving under the influence|DUI]] and died.\n\nThe Colonel and Pudge are devastated and blame themselves, wondering about her reasons for undertaking the urgent drive and even contemplating that she might have deliberately killed herself. The Colonel insists on questioning Jake, her boyfriend, but Pudge refuses, fearing that he might learn that Alaska never loved him. They argue and the Colonel accuses Pudge of only loving an idealized Alaska that Pudge made up in his head. Pudge realizes the truth of this and reconciles with the Colonel.\n\nAs a way of celebrating Alaska's life, Pudge, the Colonel, Takumi, and Lara team up with the Weekday Warriors to hire a male stripper to speak at Culver's Speaker Day. The whole school finds it hilarious; Mr. Starnes even acknowledges how clever it was. Pudge finds Alaska's copy of ''[[The General in His Labyrinth]]'' with the labyrinth quote underlined and notices the words \"straight and fast\" written in the margins. He remembers Alaska died on the morning after the anniversary of her mother's death and concludes that Alaska felt guilty for not visiting her mother's grave and, in her rush, might have been trying to reach the cemetery. On the last day of school, Takumi confesses in a note that he was the last person to see Alaska, and he let her go as well. Pudge realizes that letting her go doesn't matter as much anymore. He forgives Alaska for dying, as he knows Alaska forgives him for letting her go.\n\n== Style ==\n''Looking for Alaska'' is divided into two halves and narrated by main character Miles Halter. Rather than the typical numerical system, each chapter is denoted through the number of days before Alaska's death or the number of days after. The genesis of this structure resulted from John Green's influence of public reactions to the events on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001.]] <ref name=\":33\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292717/looking-for-alaska-by-john-green/9780593109069|title=Looking for Alaska by John Green - Reading Guide: 9780593109069 - PenguinRandomHouse.com: Books|website=PenguinRandomhouse.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-authors/article/65089-john-green-celebrates-10-years-of-looking-for-alaska.html|title=John Green Celebrates 10 Years of 'Looking for Alaska'|last=Maughan|first=Shannon|date=2014|website=Publisher's Weekly|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In an interview with [[Random House|Random House Publishing]], Green recalled that newscasters stated that people would now view the world through the lens of either before or after 9/11.<ref name=\":33\"/> Green says in the same interview, \u201cWe look back to the most important moment in our history, and that becomes the dividing line between what we were and what we are now.

While looking for answers, the boys are subconsciously dealing with their grief, and their obsession with finding answers transforms into a search for meaning. Pudge and Colonel want to find out the answers to certain questions surrounding Alaska's death, but in reality, they are enduring their own labyrinths of suffering, a concept central to the novel. When their theology teacher Mr. Hyde poses a question to his class about the meaning of life, Pudge takes this opportunity to write about it as a labyrinth of suffering. He accepts that it exists and admits that even though the tragic loss of Alaska created his own labyrinth of suffering, he continues to have faith in the \"Great Perhaps,'\" meaning that Pudge must search for meaning in his life through inevitable grief and suffering. Literary scholar from the University of Northern British Columbia Barb Dean analyzes Pudge and the Colonel's quest for answers as they venture into finding deeper meaning in life.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because this investigation turns into something that is used to deal with the harsh reality of losing Alaska, it leads to Pudge finding his way through his own personal labyrinth of suffering and finding deeper meaning to his life.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's ''Looking for Alaska''|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|page=31}}</ref>\n\n===Grief===\nWhen Alaska dies unexpectedly, the repercussions in the lives of her friends are significant, especially for Pudge and the Colonel. Barb Dean concludes that it is normal to seek answers about what happened and why.<ref name=\":15\" /> She also points out that in writing ''Looking for Alaska'', John Green wished to dive deeper into the grieving process by asking the question \"how does one rationalize the harshness and messiness of life when one has, through stupid, thoughtless, and very human actions, contributed to that very harshness?\" <ref name=\":15\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's Looking for Alaska|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|page=29}}</ref> Pudge and the Colonel blame themselves for Alaska's death because they do not stop her from driving while intoxicated. Because of this, their grieving process consists of seeking answers surrounding her death since they feel that they are responsible. Ultimately, Miles is able to come to the conclusion that Alaska would forgive him for any fault of his in her death and thus his grief is resolved in a healthy way.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Looking for Alaska|last=Green|first=John|publisher=Dutton Juvenile|year=2005|isbn=978-0-525-47506-4|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00gree/page/221 221]|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00gree/page/221}}</ref>\n\n=== Coming of age ===\nThroughout the book, the events that Miles and other characters experience are typical coming-of-age situations. Book reviews often note this theme, bringing up the instances in the book such as grief that cause the characters to look at life from a new and more mature perspective.<ref>Barkdoll, Jayme K., and Lisa Scherff. \"\"Literature is Not a Cold, Dead Place\": An Interview with John Green.\" ''English Journal'' 97.3 (2008): 67-71. ''ProQuest Central, Research Library.'' Web.</ref> Reviews also mention that the characters themselves resemble coming-of-age figures as they are relatable to readers going through similar experiences.<ref name=\"Heryani 136\"/>  Barb Dean also concludes that the characters grow up faster than expected while investigating Alaska's death because exploring the concept of the labyrinth of suffering is Miles' \"rite of passage\" into adulthood, and he learns more about himself through grieving for Alaska.<ref name=\":2\" /> Reviews also note activities such as drinking and smoking, which, though controversial, are often viewed as rites of passage by the teenagers in this novel.<ref name=\":3\">Ritchie, John. \"Looking for Alaska.\" ''ALAN Review'' 32.3 (2005): 36. ''ProQuest Central.'' Web.</ref>\n\n===Hope===\nThe theme of hope plays a major role in ''Looking for Alaska''. Even though some of the novel's prominent themes are about death, grief and loss, Green ties hope into the end of the novel to solve Pudge's internal conflict that is incited by Alaska's death. In Barb Dean's chapter about the novel, she takes a closer look into Mr. Hyde's theology class where he discusses the similarity of the idea of hope between the founding figures of Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism.<ref name=\":2\" /> Mr. Hyde also asks the class what their call for hope is, and Pudge decides his is his escape of his personal labyrinth of suffering. For Pudge, his call for hope is understanding the reality of suffering while also acknowledging that things like friendship and forgiveness can help diminish this suffering. Dean notes that Green has said that he writes fiction in order to \"'keep that fragile strand of radical hope [alive], to build a fire in the darkness.'\" <ref name=\"Dean Article\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's ''Looking for Alaska''|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|pages=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\n=== Youth-adult relationships ===\n''Looking for Alaska'' is a novel that exposes readers to the interpersonal relationships between the youth and adult characters in the novel. Green presents specific adult characters, like The Eagle who is the dean of students, whose main focus is to eliminate the rebellious tendencies of various students.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite document|title=Reaching Reluctant Readers (Aka Books for Boys)|last=Jeffery|first=Dwayne|id = {{ProQuest|212246506}}}}</ref> On the contrary, certain characters, like Dr. Hyde, the school's religious studies teacher, express positive beliefs in his students, while still maintaining an authoritative role within the classroom environment. The relationship that exists between Dr. Hyde and his students' illustrates how mutual respect can lead to positive interpersonal relationships between the youth and adults.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n''Looking for Alaska'' has received both positive reviews and attempts at censorship in multiple school districts.

In May 2012, Sumner County in Tennessee also banned the teaching of ''Looking for Alaska''. The school's spokesman argued that two pages of the novel included enough explicit content to ban the novel.\n\n==== Depew High School, Buffalo, New York ====\nTwo teachers at [[Depew Union Free School District|Depew High School]] near [[Buffalo, New York]], used the book for eleventh grade instruction in 2008. ''Looking for Alaska'' was challenged by parents for its sexual content and moral disagreements with the novel. Despite the teachers providing an alternate book, parents still argued for it to be removed from curriculum due to its inappropriate content such as offensive language, sexually explicit content, including a scene described as \"pornographic\", and references to homosexuality, drugs, alcohol, and smoking. The book was ultimately kept in the curriculum by the school board after a unanimous school board vote with the stipulation that the teachers of the 11th grade class give the parents a decision to have their children read an alternate book. ''Looking for Alaska'' was defended by the school district because they felt it dealt with themes relevant to students of this age, such as death, drinking and driving, and peer pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/11EC3D5A88D1F710?p=AWNB|title=Committee will review controversial teenage book - Board will then decide if novel can be textbook|last1=Winchester|first1=Laura E.|website=The Buffalo news|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Controversy due to cover design ====\nFurther controversy came from the cover art. In August 2012, Green acknowledged that the extinguished candle on the cover leads to \"an improbable amount of smoke\", and explained that the initial cover design did not feature the candle. Green said that certain book chains were uncomfortable with displaying or selling a book with a cover that featured cigarette smoke, so the candle was added beneath the smoke.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coAa_HtrmNk|title=In Which the Candle Dies|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=14 May 2015|work=YouTube}}</ref> In Green's box set, released on October 25, 2012, the candle has been removed from the cover. Further paperback releases of the book also have the candle removed.\n\n==== West Ada School District, Idaho ====\nIn 2016, the [[West Ada School District]] in [[Meridian, Idaho]] removed ''Looking for Alaska'' from all of its middle school libraries.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=David R.|date=2018-07-06|title=Censorship Dateline|journal=Journal of Intellectual Freedom & Privacy|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24|doi=10.5860/jifp.v3i1.6740|issn=2474-7459}}</ref> The school district found the content of the book to be too inappropriate for middle school students. The school district originally received a complaint from a parent on the grounds of the presence of foul language and mentions of actions like smoking and suicide. The district librarian looked into parental complaints along with reviews of the novel suggesting that it was best suited for high schoolers and made the decision to pull the book from the middle school library.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Marion County, Kentucky ====\nIn 2016 in [[Marion County, Kentucky]], parents urged schools to drop it from the curriculum, referring to it as influencing students \"to experiment with pornography, sex, drugs, alcohol and profanity.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/28/battle-keep-looking-for-alaska-kentucky-school-curriculum-john-green-ya|title=US battle over banning Looking for Alaska continues in Kentucky|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2016-04-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-26|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Although the teacher offered an opt-out book for the class, one parent still felt as though the book should be banned entirely and filed a formal complaint. After the challenge, students were given an alternate book for any parents who were not comfortable with their children reading the book.

The video, entitled \"I Am Not A Pornographer\", describes the Depew High School challenge of ''Looking for Alaska'' and his frustration at the description of his novel as pornography. Green explains the inclusion of the oral sex scene in ''Looking for Alaska'' stating, \"The whole reason that scene in question exists in ''Looking for Alaska'' is because I wanted to draw a contrast between that scene, when there is a lot of physical intimacy, but it is ultimately very emotionally empty, and the scene that immediately follows it, when there is not a serious physical interaction, but there's this intense emotional connection.\" Green argues that the misunderstanding of his book is the reason for its controversy, and urges people to understand the actual literary content before judging specific scenes. He also disagrees with the way that groups of parents underestimate the intelligence of teenagers and their ability to analyze literature. He ends with encouraging his viewers to attend the Depew School Board hearing to support the choice of parents, students, and teachers to have ''Looking for Alaska'' included in public schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHMPtYvZ8tM|title=I Am Not A Pornographer|last1=Green|first1=John|website=YouTube|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptation==\n{{main|Looking for Alaska (TV series)}}\nThe film rights to the novel were acquired by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 2005.

Throughout the first half of the novel, Miles and his friends Chip \"The Colonel\" Martin, Alaska Young, and Takumi Hikohito grow very close and the section culminates in Alaska's death. In the second half of the novel, Miles and his friends work to discover the missing details of the night Alaska died. While struggling to reconcile Alaska's death, Miles grapples with  Sim\u00f3n Bolivar's last words and the meaning of life, leaving the conclusion to these topics unresolved.\n\n''Looking for Alaska'' is a coming-of-age novel that touches on themes of meaning, grief, hope, and youth-adult relationships. The novel won the 2006 [[Michael L.

His parents agreed, and he spent the remainder of his time in high school at Indian Springs School forming valuable relationships with teachers, relationships that Green says still exist today.<ref name=\":0\" /> Green's experience at boarding school inspired him to write ''Looking for Alaska.''

He also noted that his inspiration for the possessed swan in Culver Creek derived from a similar swan he remembers at Indian Springs. The two pranks that occur in the book are similar to pranks that Green pulled at school, but Green emphasizes that while the setting is based on his life, the novel is entirely fictional.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JLuF8GmtH4|title=John Green's Legendary High School Prank|date=8 December 2007|work=YouTube|accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs a child, Green became infatuated with famous last words, specifically those of [[John Adams]].

Learning of Pudge's obsession with famous last words, Alaska informs him of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's]]: \"Damn it.

Alaska sets Pudge up with a Romanian classmate, Lara. Unfortunately, Pudge and Lara have a disastrous date, ending with a concussed Pudge throwing up on Lara. Alaska and Pudge grow closer and he begins to fall in love with her, although she insists on keeping their relationship [[Platonic love|platonic]] because she has a boyfriend at [[Vanderbilt University]] whom she insists she loves.\n\nOn his first night at Culver Creek, Pudge is kidnapped and thrown into a lake by the \"Weekday Warriors,\" a group of rich schoolmates who blame the Colonel and his friends for the expulsion of their friend, Paul. Paul's expulsion created tension between Pudge's friends and the Weekday Warriors. Takumi claims that they are innocent because their friend Marya was also [[expulsion (education)#United States and Canada|expelled]] during the incident.  However, Alaska later admits that she told on both Marya and Paul to the dean, Mr. Starnes, to save herself from being expelled.\n\nThe gang celebrates a successful series of pranks by drinking and partying, and an inebriated Alaska confides about her mother's death from an [[aneurysm]] when she was eight years old. Although she didn't understand at the time, she feels guilty for not calling 911. Pudge figures that her mother's death made Alaska impulsive and rash. He concludes that the labyrinth was a person's suffering and that humans must try to find their way out. Afterwards, Pudge grows closer to Lara, and they start dating. A week later, after another 'celebration', an intoxicated Alaska and Pudge spend the night with each other, when suddenly Alaska receives a phone call which causes her to go into hysterics. Insisting that she has to leave, Alaska drives away while drunk with Pudge and the Colonel distracting Mr. Starnes. They later learn that Alaska was [[driving under the influence|DUI]] and died.\n\nThe Colonel and Pudge are devastated and blame themselves, wondering about her reasons for undertaking the urgent drive and even contemplating that she might have deliberately killed herself. The Colonel insists on questioning Jake, her boyfriend, but Pudge refuses, fearing that he might learn that Alaska never loved him. They argue and the Colonel accuses Pudge of only loving an idealized Alaska that Pudge made up in his head. Pudge realizes the truth of this and reconciles with the Colonel.\n\nAs a way of celebrating Alaska's life, Pudge, the Colonel, Takumi, and Lara team up with the Weekday Warriors to hire a male stripper to speak at Culver's Speaker Day. The whole school finds it hilarious; Mr. Starnes even acknowledges how clever it was. Pudge finds Alaska's copy of ''[[The General in His Labyrinth]]'' with the labyrinth quote underlined and notices the words \"straight and fast\" written in the margins. He remembers Alaska died on the morning after the anniversary of her mother's death and concludes that Alaska felt guilty for not visiting her mother's grave and, in her rush, might have been trying to reach the cemetery. On the last day of school, Takumi confesses in a note that he was the last person to see Alaska, and he let her go as well. Pudge realizes that letting her go doesn't matter as much anymore. He forgives Alaska for dying, as he knows Alaska forgives him for letting her go.\n\n== Style ==\n''Looking for Alaska'' is divided into two halves and narrated by main character Miles Halter. Rather than the typical numerical system, each chapter is denoted through the number of days before Alaska's death or the number of days after. The genesis of this structure resulted from John Green's influence of public reactions to the events on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001.]] <ref name=\":33\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292717/looking-for-alaska-by-john-green/9780593109069|title=Looking for Alaska by John Green - Reading Guide: 9780593109069 - PenguinRandomHouse.com: Books|website=PenguinRandomhouse.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-authors/article/65089-john-green-celebrates-10-years-of-looking-for-alaska.html|title=John Green Celebrates 10 Years of 'Looking for Alaska'|last=Maughan|first=Shannon|date=2014|website=Publisher's Weekly|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In an interview with [[Random House|Random House Publishing]], Green recalled that newscasters stated that people would now view the world through the lens of either before or after 9/11.<ref name=\":33\"/> Green says in the same interview, \u201cWe look back to the most important moment in our history, and that becomes the dividing line between what we were and what we are now.

While looking for answers, the boys are subconsciously dealing with their grief, and their obsession with finding answers transforms into a search for meaning. Pudge and Colonel want to find out the answers to certain questions surrounding Alaska's death, but in reality, they are enduring their own labyrinths of suffering, a concept central to the novel. When their theology teacher Mr. Hyde poses a question to his class about the meaning of life, Pudge takes this opportunity to write about it as a labyrinth of suffering. He accepts that it exists and admits that even though the tragic loss of Alaska created his own labyrinth of suffering, he continues to have faith in the \"Great Perhaps,'\" meaning that Pudge must search for meaning in his life through inevitable grief and suffering. Literary scholar from the University of Northern British Columbia Barb Dean analyzes Pudge and the Colonel's quest for answers as they venture into finding deeper meaning in life.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because this investigation turns into something that is used to deal with the harsh reality of losing Alaska, it leads to Pudge finding his way through his own personal labyrinth of suffering and finding deeper meaning to his life.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's ''Looking for Alaska''|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|page=31}}</ref>\n\n===Grief===\nWhen Alaska dies unexpectedly, the repercussions in the lives of her friends are significant, especially for Pudge and the Colonel. Barb Dean concludes that it is normal to seek answers about what happened and why.<ref name=\":15\" /> She also points out that in writing ''Looking for Alaska'', John Green wished to dive deeper into the grieving process by asking the question \"how does one rationalize the harshness and messiness of life when one has, through stupid, thoughtless, and very human actions, contributed to that very harshness?\" <ref name=\":15\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's Looking for Alaska|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|page=29}}</ref> Pudge and the Colonel blame themselves for Alaska's death because they do not stop her from driving while intoxicated. Because of this, their grieving process consists of seeking answers surrounding her death since they feel that they are responsible. Ultimately, Miles is able to come to the conclusion that Alaska would forgive him for any fault of his in her death and thus his grief is resolved in a healthy way.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Looking for Alaska|last=Green|first=John|publisher=Dutton Juvenile|year=2005|isbn=978-0-525-47506-4|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00gree/page/221 221]|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00gree/page/221}}</ref>\n\n=== Coming of age ===\nThroughout the book, the events that Miles and other characters experience are typical coming-of-age situations. Book reviews often note this theme, bringing up the instances in the book such as grief that cause the characters to look at life from a new and more mature perspective.<ref>Barkdoll, Jayme K., and Lisa Scherff. \"\"Literature is Not a Cold, Dead Place\": An Interview with John Green.\" ''English Journal'' 97.3 (2008): 67-71.

Web.</ref> Reviews also mention that the characters themselves resemble coming-of-age figures as they are relatable to readers going through similar experiences.<ref name=\"Heryani 136\"/>  Barb Dean also concludes that the characters grow up faster than expected while investigating Alaska's death because exploring the concept of the labyrinth of suffering is Miles' \"rite of passage\" into adulthood, and he learns more about himself through grieving for Alaska.<ref name=\":2\" /> Reviews also note activities such as drinking and smoking, which, though controversial, are often viewed as rites of passage by the teenagers in this novel.<ref name=\":3\">Ritchie, John. \"Looking for Alaska.\" ''ALAN Review'' 32.3 (2005): 36. ''ProQuest Central.'' Web.</ref>\n\n===Hope===\nThe theme of hope plays a major role in ''Looking for Alaska''. Even though some of the novel's prominent themes are about death, grief and loss, Green ties hope into the end of the novel to solve Pudge's internal conflict that is incited by Alaska's death. In Barb Dean's chapter about the novel, she takes a closer look into Mr. Hyde's theology class where he discusses the similarity of the idea of hope between the founding figures of Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism.<ref name=\":2\" /> Mr. Hyde also asks the class what their call for hope is, and Pudge decides his is his escape of his personal labyrinth of suffering. For Pudge, his call for hope is understanding the reality of suffering while also acknowledging that things like friendship and forgiveness can help diminish this suffering. Dean notes that Green has said that he writes fiction in order to \"'keep that fragile strand of radical hope [alive], to build a fire in the darkness.'\" <ref name=\"Dean Article\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's ''Looking for Alaska''|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|pages=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\n=== Youth-adult relationships ===\n''Looking for Alaska'' is a novel that exposes readers to the interpersonal relationships between the youth and adult characters in the novel. Green presents specific adult characters, like The Eagle who is the dean of students, whose main focus is to eliminate the rebellious tendencies of various students.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite document|title=Reaching Reluctant Readers (Aka Books for Boys)|last=Jeffery|first=Dwayne|id = {{ProQuest|212246506}}}}</ref> On the contrary, certain characters, like Dr. Hyde, the school's religious studies teacher, express positive beliefs in his students, while still maintaining an authoritative role within the classroom environment. The relationship that exists between Dr. Hyde and his students' illustrates how mutual respect can lead to positive interpersonal relationships between the youth and adults.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Reception ==\nLooking for Alaska has received both positive reviews and attempts at censorship in multiple school districts.

In May 2012, Sumner County in Tennessee also banned the teaching of ''Looking for Alaska''. The school's spokesman argued that two pages of the novel included enough explicit content to ban the novel.\n\n==== Depew High School, Buffalo, New York ====\nTwo teachers at [[Depew Union Free School District|Depew High School]] near [[Buffalo, New York]], used the book for eleventh grade instruction in 2008. ''Looking for Alaska'' was challenged by parents for its sexual content and moral disagreements with the novel. Despite the teachers providing an alternate book, parents still argued for it to be removed from curriculum due to its inappropriate content such as offensive language, sexually explicit content, including a scene described as \"pornographic\", and references to homosexuality, drugs, alcohol, and smoking. The book was ultimately kept in the curriculum by the school board after a unanimous school board vote with the stipulation that the teachers of the 11th grade class give the parents a decision to have their children read an alternate book. ''Looking for Alaska'' was defended by the school district because they felt it dealt with themes relevant to students of this age, such as death, drinking and driving, and peer pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/11EC3D5A88D1F710?p=AWNB|title=Committee will review controversial teenage book - Board will then decide if novel can be textbook|last1=Winchester|first1=Laura E.|website=The Buffalo news|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Controversy due to cover design ====\nFurther controversy came from the cover art. In August 2012, Green acknowledged that the extinguished candle on the cover leads to \"an improbable amount of smoke\", and explained that the initial cover design did not feature the candle. Green said that certain book chains were uncomfortable with displaying or selling a book with a cover that featured cigarette smoke, so the candle was added beneath the smoke.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coAa_HtrmNk|title=In Which the Candle Dies|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=14 May 2015|work=YouTube}}</ref> In Green's box set, released on October 25, 2012, the candle has been removed from the cover. Further paperback releases of the book also have the candle removed.\n\n==== West Ada School District, Idaho ====\nIn 2016, the [[West Ada School District]] in [[Meridian, Idaho]] removed ''Looking for Alaska'' from all of its middle school libraries.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=David R.|date=2018-07-06|title=Censorship Dateline|journal=Journal of Intellectual Freedom & Privacy|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24|doi=10.5860/jifp.v3i1.6740|issn=2474-7459}}</ref> The school district found the content of the book to be too inappropriate for middle school students. The school district originally received a complaint from a parent on the grounds of the presence of foul language and mentions of actions like smoking and suicide. The district librarian looked into parental complaints along with reviews of the novel suggesting that it was best suited for high schoolers and made the decision to pull the book from the middle school library.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Marion County, Kentucky ====\nIn 2016 in [[Marion County, Kentucky]], parents urged schools to drop it from the curriculum, referring to it as influencing students \"to experiment with pornography, sex, drugs, alcohol and profanity.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/28/battle-keep-looking-for-alaska-kentucky-school-curriculum-john-green-ya|title=US battle over banning Looking for Alaska continues in Kentucky|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2016-04-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-26|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Although the teacher offered an opt-out book for the class, one parent still felt as though the book should be banned entirely and filed a formal complaint. After the challenge, students were given an alternate book for any parents who were not comfortable with their children reading the book.

The video, entitled \"I Am Not A Pornographer\", describes the Depew High School challenge of ''Looking for Alaska'' and his frustration at the description of his novel as pornography. Green explains the inclusion of the oral sex scene in ''Looking for Alaska'' stating, \"The whole reason that scene in question exists in ''Looking for Alaska'' is because I wanted to draw a contrast between that scene, when there is a lot of physical intimacy, but it is ultimately very emotionally empty, and the scene that immediately follows it, when there is not a serious physical interaction, but there's this intense emotional connection.\" Green argues that the misunderstanding of his book is the reason for its controversy, and urges people to understand the actual literary content before judging specific scenes. He also disagrees with the way that groups of parents underestimate the intelligence of teenagers and their ability to analyze literature. He ends with encouraging his viewers to attend the Depew School Board hearing to support the choice of parents, students, and teachers to have ''Looking for Alaska'' included in public schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHMPtYvZ8tM|title=I Am Not A Pornographer|last1=Green|first1=John|website=YouTube|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptation==\n{{main|Looking for Alaska (TV series)}}\nThe film rights to the novel were acquired by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 2005.

The bulk of the material was written by Johansen and guitarist [[Johnny Thunders]]. The Dolls were well received critically, but did not succeed commercially.\n\nIn 1975, Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan left the band. Johansen and [[Sylvain Sylvain]], along with Peter Jordan, Chris Robison, and Tony Machine, continued playing as the New York Dolls until 1976, after which Johansen embarked on a solo career.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> His first two albums, ''David Johansen'' and ''In Style'', featured several enduring originals.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Sylvain Sylvain frequently performed with him, and his band covered many Dolls songs in concert; his live albums ''Live It Up'' and ''The David Johansen Group Live'' document Johansen's reputation as an exceptional concert performer. The studio releases ''Here Comes the Night'' (which includes a signature number, \"Heart of Gold\") and ''Sweet Revenge'' again showcased his strengths as a writer of new material and featured a guest appearance by jazz saxophone player [[Big Jay McNeely]]. A number of the songs on ''Here Comes the Night'' were co-written with South African musician [[Blondie Chaplin]]. In 1982 Johansen was the opening act for [[The Who]] at several U.S. East Coast concerts, Shea Stadium Queensborough and [[Capital Centre (Landover, Maryland)|Capital Centre]].\n\n===Buster Poindexter===\nIn the late 1980s, Johansen achieved moderate commercial success under the pseudonym Buster Poindexter,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> accompanied by The Uptown Horns, performing a mixture of [[jazz]], [[lounge music|lounge]], [[Calypso music|calypso]], and novelty songs, and appearing as part of the [[house band]] on the television program ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. As Poindexter, he scored his first [[Record chart#Chart hit|hit]] song, \"[[Hot Hot Hot (Arrow song)#Buster Poindexter version|Hot Hot Hot]],\" which, in an interview on [[NPR|National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Fresh Air]]'', he called \"the bane of my existence,\" due to its pervasive popularity. \"Hot Hot Hot\" was initially written and recorded by [[Montserrat]]ian [[Soca music|Soca]] artist [[Arrow (musician)|Arrow]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> As Poindexter, Johansen often appeared with his band, The Banshees of Blue. Early Poindexter releases combined an eclectic selection of covers with Johansen's own compositions. Johansen went on to issue ''Buster Poindexter's Happy Hour'', an album of songs thematically linked by their subject matter: alcohol. It is his most jazz-influenced release to date. It was followed by ''Buster Poindexter's Spanish Rocket Ship'', a synthesis of [[rhythm and blues]], calypso and Latin jazz.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n==Acting==\nJohansen's legs appeared in [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]'s 1971 film ''[[Up Your Legs Forever]]''.<ref name=\"Cott2013\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Cott|title=Days That I'll Remember: Spending Time With John Lennon & Yoko Ono|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ei8DAwAAQBAJ|date=16 July 2013|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-78323-048-8|page=74}}</ref>\n\nJohansen acted in several films during the 1980s and 1990s, and in 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0423774/|title=David Johansen|website=IMDb}}</ref> had a brief role on the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''. He appeared in the television series ''[[The Adventures of Pete & Pete]]'' in the episode \"On Golden Pete\", in which he played a park ranger. He appeared in the Muppet Television segment of an episode of ''[[The Jim Henson Hour]]''. Among his more prominent roles are that of the wisecracking Ghost of Christmas Past in ''[[Scrooged]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> as well as the part of \"Looney\" in the movie ''[[Let It Ride (film)|Let It Ride]]'', playing opposite [[Richard Dreyfuss]]. He starred opposite [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Sherman Hemsley]] in ''[[Mr. Nanny]]'', and co-starred with [[John C. McGinley]] in the movie ''[[Car 54, Where Are You? (film)|Car 54, Where Are You?]]'', based on the television series. He can be seen in the [[Jim White (musician)|Jim White]] documentary film ''Searching for the Wrong Eyed Jesus'' in which he sings a version of [[Geeshie Wiley]]'s \"Last Kind Words\" while in a motel room. He also had a supporting role with Mick Jagger and Emilio Estevez in the movie ''[[Freejack]]''. He also played Halston (a hired [[Contract killing|hitman]]) in the anthology film ''[[Tales from the Darkside: The Movie]]'' (1990), in the segment \"[[The Cat from Hell]]\". He was also the guest music artist on the ''[[Miami Vice]]'' episode \"The Dutch Oven\" (1985) where he sang \"King of Babylon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0647121/|title=The Dutch Oven|date=October 25, 1985|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> Johansen most recently portrayed the bartender in the Netflix special ''[[A Very Murray Christmas]]''. Johansen lent his voice to the villain [[Ding Dong Daddy]] in the original ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series in the season 5 episode 9 episode \"Revved Up\".\n\n===Later solo career===\n[[File:David Johansen 2008.JPG|thumb|Johansen performing in Toronto concert, Feb 18, 2008]]\nJohansen then turned to country blues with his group, The Harry Smiths. The group was named as a tribute to [[Harry Everett Smith]], who compiled the ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'', several songs of which were covered by the band. Johansen's second album with the Harry Smiths is titled ''Shaker''.\n\nIn 2004, Johansen reunited with Sylvain Sylvain and [[Arthur Kane]] of the New York Dolls. Owing to the success of the tour, in 2006 the New York Dolls released ''One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This'', their first album in nearly thirty years. It was critic [[Robert Christgau]]'s choice for album of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/deans06.php |title=2006: Dean's List |publisher=Robert Christgau |date=February 14, 2007 |access-date=2013-06-15}}</ref> In 2009 the band released ''[[Cause I Sez So]]'' and in 2011 ''[[Dancing Backward in High Heels]]''.\n\nJohansen hosts a weekly show, ''David Johansen's Mansion of Fun'', on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] while continuing to write and perform. Featuring music \"from the jungles of Africa to the Bayou of Louisiana, and from [[Duke Ellington]] to [[Phil Spector]] to [[Billy Joe Shaver]], the show is all over the musical map,\" truly free-form and eclectic. {{as of|2019|1}}, the show airs on channel 30, [[The Loft (Sirius XM)|The Loft]].\n\nIn October 2007, Johansen participated in \"The Staten Island Composers Project,\" featuring work by three musicians who call the island home: Johansen; [[Vernon Reid]], founder of the '80s rock-metal pioneers [[Living Colour]]; and [[Galt MacDermot]], best known as the composer of the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]].'' The Council on the Arts and Humanities for Staten Island commissioned the program and asked each artist to write 20 minutes of music conveying something of his connection to the island often referred to as New York City's forgotten borough. Johansen's opus, a cinematic and unabashedly romantic [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Adagio]] scored mostly for strings, is called \"Mara Dreams the Moon Gate of Uncommon Beauty\". Inspired by The Moon Gate of Uncommon Beauty, a round portal between two rockscapes in the Chinese Scholar's Garden at the [[Sailors' Snug Harbor#Staten Island Botanical Garden|Staten Island Botanical Garden]]. In September 2009, he appeared on ''[[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations]]'', the [[Travel Channel]] television program, in which he toured [[Staten Island]] with the program's host.\n\nIn addition to his own albums, Johansen contributed songs to the soundtracks of the films ''[[Times Square (1980 film)|Times Square]]'' and ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (\"Flowers of the City\" and \"Ain't Cha Glad\" respectively) and guests on ''About Them Shoes'', a [[Compact disc|CD]] by veteran blues man [[Hubert Sumlin]]. Another non-album track of his, \"Johnsonius\", appears on the 1984 compilation ''[[A Diamond Hidden in the Mouth of a Corpse]]'' and \"The Rope (The Let Go Song)\", a track originally recorded during the sessions for his eponymous first album, and published on the B-side of the single, \"Funky But Chic\", a song that was performed by the original New York Dolls before breaking up.\n\nAn artist noted for his musical unpredictability and versatility, Johansen has been a consistent blues enthusiast since the earliest days of the Dolls, with covers of songs by [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]] among their earliest numbers. The 2006 Dolls CD ''Private World : The Complete Early Studio Demos 1972/3'' featured the Dolls performing songs by [[Otis Redding]], [[Gary U.S. Bonds]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[The Shangri-Las]], and [[Muddy Waters]], in addition to versions of songs from their two Mercury albums.

The bulk of the material was written by Johansen and guitarist [[Johnny Thunders]]. The Dolls were well received critically, but did not succeed commercially.\n\nIn 1975, Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan left the band. Johansen and [[Sylvain Sylvain]], along with Peter Jordan, Chris Robison, and Tony Machine, continued playing as the New York Dolls until 1976, after which Johansen embarked on a solo career.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> His first two albums, ''David Johansen'' and ''In Style'', featured several enduring originals.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Sylvain Sylvain frequently performed with him, and his band covered many Dolls songs in concert; his live albums ''Live It Up'' and ''The David Johansen Group Live'' document Johansen's reputation as an exceptional concert performer. The studio releases ''Here Comes the Night'' (which includes a signature number, \"Heart of Gold\") and ''Sweet Revenge'' again showcased his strengths as a writer of new material and featured a guest appearance by jazz saxophone player [[Big Jay McNeely]]. A number of the songs on ''Here Comes the Night'' were co-written with South African musician [[Blondie Chaplin]]. In 1982 Johansen was the opening act for [[The Who]] at several U.S. East Coast concerts, Shea Stadium Queensborough and [[Capital Centre (Landover, Maryland)|Capital Centre]].\n\n===Buster Poindexter===\nIn the late 1980s, Johansen achieved moderate commercial success under the pseudonym Buster Poindexter,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> accompanied by The Uptown Horns, performing a mixture of [[jazz]], [[lounge music|lounge]], [[Calypso music|calypso]], and novelty songs, and appearing as part of the [[house band]] on the television program ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. As Poindexter, he scored his first [[Record chart#Chart hit|hit]] song, \"[[Hot Hot Hot (Arrow song)#Buster Poindexter version|Hot Hot Hot]],\" which, in an interview on [[NPR|National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Fresh Air]]'', he called \"the bane of my existence,\" due to its pervasive popularity. \"Hot Hot Hot\" was initially written and recorded by [[Montserrat]]ian [[Soca music|Soca]] artist [[Arrow (musician)|Arrow]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> As Poindexter, Johansen often appeared with his band, The Banshees of Blue. Early Poindexter releases combined an eclectic selection of covers with Johansen's own compositions. Johansen went on to issue ''Buster Poindexter's Happy Hour'', an album of songs thematically linked by their subject matter: alcohol. It is his most jazz-influenced release to date. It was followed by ''Buster Poindexter's Spanish Rocket Ship'', a synthesis of [[rhythm and blues]], calypso and Latin jazz.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n==Acting==\nJohansen's legs appeared in [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]'s 1971 film ''[[Up Your Legs Forever]]''.<ref name=\"Cott2013\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Cott|title=Days That I'll Remember: Spending Time With John Lennon & Yoko Ono|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ei8DAwAAQBAJ|date=16 July 2013|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-78323-048-8|page=74}}</ref>\n\nJohansen acted in several films during the 1980s and 1990s, and in 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0423774/|title=David Johansen|website=IMDb}}</ref> had a brief role on the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''. He appeared in the television series ''[[The Adventures of Pete & Pete]]'' in the episode \"On Golden Pete\", in which he played a park ranger. He appeared in the Muppet Television segment of an episode of ''[[The Jim Henson Hour]]''. Among his more prominent roles are that of the wisecracking Ghost of Christmas Past in ''[[Scrooged]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> as well as the part of \"Looney\" in the movie ''[[Let It Ride (film)|Let It Ride]]'', playing opposite [[Richard Dreyfuss]]. He starred opposite [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Sherman Hemsley]] in ''[[Mr. Nanny]]'', and co-starred with [[John C. McGinley]] in the movie ''[[Car 54, Where Are You? (film)|Car 54, Where Are You?]]'', based on the television series. He can be seen in the [[Jim White (musician)|Jim White]] documentary film ''Searching for the Wrong Eyed Jesus'' in which he sings a version of [[Geeshie Wiley]]'s \"Last Kind Words\" while in a motel room. He also had a supporting role with Mick Jagger and Emilio Estevez in the movie ''[[Freejack]]''. He also played Halston (a hired [[Contract killing|hitman]]) in the anthology film ''[[Tales from the Darkside: The Movie]]'' (1990), in the segment \"[[The Cat from Hell]]\". He was also the guest music artist on the ''[[Miami Vice]]'' episode \"The Dutch Oven\" (1985) where he sang \"King of Babylon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0647121/|title=The Dutch Oven|date=October 25, 1985|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> Johansen most recently portrayed the bartender in the Netflix special ''[[A Very Murray Christmas]]''. Johansen lent his voice to the villain [[Ding Dong Daddy]] in the original ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series in the season 5 episode 9 episode \"Revved Up\".\n\n===Later solo career===\n[[File:David Johansen 2008.JPG|thumb|Johansen performing in Toronto concert, Feb 18, 2008]]\nJohansen then turned to country blues with his group, The Harry Smiths. The group was named as a tribute to [[Harry Everett Smith]], who compiled the ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'', several songs of which were covered by the band. Johansen's second album with the Harry Smiths is titled ''Shaker''.\n\nIn 2004, Johansen reunited with Sylvain Sylvain and [[Arthur Kane]] of the New York Dolls. Owing to the success of the tour, in 2006 the New York Dolls released ''One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This'', their first album in nearly thirty years. It was critic [[Robert Christgau]]'s choice for album of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/deans06.php |title=2006: Dean's List |publisher=Robert Christgau |date=February 14, 2007 |access-date=2013-06-15}}</ref> In 2009 the band released ''[[Cause I Sez So]]'' and in 2011 ''[[Dancing Backward in High Heels]]''.\n\nJohansen hosts a weekly show, ''David Johansen's Mansion of Fun'', on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] while continuing to write and perform. Featuring music \"from the jungles of Africa to the Bayou of Louisiana, and from [[Duke Ellington]] to [[Phil Spector]] to [[Billy Joe Shaver]], the show is all over the musical map,\" truly free-form and eclectic. {{as of|2019|1}}, the show airs on channel 30, [[The Loft (Sirius XM)|The Loft]].\n\nIn October 2007, Johansen participated in \"The Staten Island Composers Project,\" featuring work by three musicians who call the island home: Johansen; [[Vernon Reid]], founder of the '80s rock-metal pioneers [[Living Colour]]; and [[Galt MacDermot]], best known as the composer of the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]].'' The Council on the Arts and Humanities for Staten Island commissioned the program and asked each artist to write 20 minutes of music conveying something of his connection to the island often referred to as New York City's forgotten borough. Johansen's opus, a cinematic and unabashedly romantic [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|Adagio]] scored mostly for strings, is called \"Mara Dreams the Moon Gate of Uncommon Beauty\". Inspired by The Moon Gate of Uncommon Beauty, a round portal between two rockscapes in the Chinese Scholar's Garden at the [[Sailors' Snug Harbor#Staten Island Botanical Garden|Staten Island Botanical Garden]]. In September 2009, he appeared on ''[[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations]]'', the [[Travel Channel]] television program, in which he toured [[Staten Island]] with the program's host.\n\nIn addition to his own albums, Johansen contributed songs to the soundtracks of the films ''[[Times Square (1980 film)|Times Square]]'' and ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (\"Flowers of the City\" and \"Ain't Cha Glad\" respectively) and guests on ''About Them Shoes'', a [[Compact disc|CD]] by veteran blues man [[Hubert Sumlin]]. Another non-album track of his, \"Johnsonius\", appears on the 1984 compilation ''[[A Diamond Hidden in the Mouth of a Corpse]]'' and \"The Rope (The Let Go Song)\", a track originally recorded during the sessions for his eponymous first album, and published on the B-side of the single, \"Funky But Chic\", a song that was performed by the original New York Dolls before breaking up.\n\nAn artist noted for his musical unpredictability and versatility, Johansen has been a consistent blues enthusiast since the earliest days of the Dolls, with covers of songs by [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]] among their earliest numbers. The 2006 Dolls CD ''Private World : The Complete Early Studio Demos 1972/3'' featured the Dolls performing songs by [[Otis Redding]], [[Gary U.S. Bonds]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[The Shangri-Las]], and [[Muddy Waters]], in addition to versions of songs from their two Mercury albums.

Cohan]], known as \"The Man Who Owned Broadway\".<ref>{{IBDB name|5829|George M. Cohan}}</ref> It stars [[James Cagney]], [[Joan Leslie]], [[Walter Huston]], and [[Richard Whorf]], and features [[Irene Manning]], [[George Tobias]], [[Rosemary DeCamp]], [[Jeanne Cagney]], and Vera Lewis. Joan Leslie's singing voice was partially dubbed by [[Sally Sweetland]].\n\nThe film was written by [[Robert Buckner]] and Edmund Joseph, and directed by [[Michael Curtiz]].  According to the special edition DVD, significant and uncredited improvements were made to the script by the twin brothers [[Julius J. Epstein]] and [[Philip G. Epstein]].\n\nIn 1993, ''Yankee Doodle Dandy''  was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early days of [[World War II]], Cohan comes out of retirement to star as President Roosevelt in the [[Rodgers and Hart]] musical ''[[I'd Rather Be Right]].'' On the first night, he is summoned to meet the president at the [[White House]], who presents him with a [[Congressional Gold Medal]] (though the Cohan character on screen incorrectly identifies the award as the [[Congressional Medal of Honor]]). Cohan is overcome and chats with Roosevelt, recalling his early days on the stage. The film flashes back to his supposed birth on July 4, whilst his father is performing on the [[vaudeville]] stage.\n\nCohan and his sister join the family act as soon as they can learn to dance, and soon The Four Cohans are performing successfully. But George gets too cocky as he grows up and is blacklisted by theatrical producers for being troublesome. He leaves the act and hawks his songs unsuccessfully around to producers. In partnership with [[Sam H. Harris|Sam Harris]], another struggling writer, he finally interests a producer and they are on the road to success. He also marries Mary, a young singer/dancer.\n\nAs his star ascends, he persuades his now struggling parents to join his act, eventually vesting some of his valuable theatrical properties in their name.\n\nCohan retires, but returns to the stage several times, culminating in the role of the U.S. president. As he leaves the White House, after receiving the Congressional Gold Medal from the president, he descends a set of stairs while performing a tap dance (which Cagney thought up before the scene was filmed and undertook without rehearsal). Outside, he joins a military parade, where the soldiers are singing \"[[Over There]]\", and, at first, he isn't singing. Not knowing that Cohan is the song's composer, one of them asks if he knows the words. Cohan's response is a smile before joining in to sing too.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[James Cagney]] as [[George M.

Cohan, who admired [[Fred Astaire]]'s work, let it be known that he preferred Astaire, who also bore a passing resemblance to him, to star in his life story. Warners first offered him the role but Astaire turned it down because Cohan's eccentric, stiff-legged dancing was far removed from Astaire's own, more fluid, style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfilmboy.com/2013/04/james-cagney-blogathon-yankee-doodle.html|title=Loading...|website=Classicfilmboy.com|accessdate=23 September 2017}}</ref>\n*James Cagney reprised the role of George M.

His unique and seemingly odd presentation style, of half-singing and half-reciting the songs, reflected the style that Cohan himself used.  His natural dance style and physique were also a good match for Cohan. Newspapers at the time reported that Cagney intended to consciously imitate Cohan's song-and-dance style, but to play the normal part of the acting in his own style. Although director Curtiz was known as a taskmaster, he also gave his actors some latitude. Cagney and other players came up with a number of \"bits of business\", as Cagney called them, meaning improvised lines or action in theater parlance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cengage.com/resource_uploads/static_resources/0495898074/24712/learning_lingo.html|title=Learning the Lingo|website=Cengage.com|accessdate=23 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nA number of the biographical particulars of the movie are [[Hollywood]]-ized fiction, such as omitting the fact that Cohan divorced and remarried, and combining Cohan's two wives Ethel and Agnes into a single character named Mary, and taking some liberties with the chronology of Cohan's life and the order of his parents' deaths. In one scene, after Cohan suffers a flop with an atypical non-musical drama, \"Popularity,\" he composes a telegram apologizing to the public. He then walks out of the [[Western Union]] office to find newspaper sellers announcing the [[Sinking_of_the_RMS_Lusitania|torpedoing of the Lusitania]]. In reality, the failed play was staged in 1906, and the Lusitania's sinking occurred in 1915.<ref>https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/george-m-cohan-5829</ref>\n\nNevertheless, care was taken to make the sets, costumes, and dance steps match the original stage presentations. Twice, Cagney sprained an ankle while mastering Cohan's stiff-legged dance style. This effort was aided significantly by a former associate of Cohan's, Jack Boyle, who knew the original productions well. Boyle also appeared in the film in some of the dancing groups.\n\nCagney, as Cohan, is shown performing as a singing and dancing version of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Although it was well known, the reality of Roosevelt's use of a wheelchair after [[polio]] was not emphasized at the time. In the film, Roosevelt never leaves his chair when meeting Cohan.\n\nCohan himself served as a consultant during the production of the film. Due to his failing health, his actual involvement in the film was rather limited.  However, Cohan did see the film before he died (from cancer) and approved of Cagney's portrayal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/24022%7C0/Yankee-Doodle-Dandy.html|title=Yankee Doodle Dandy|website=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=23 September 2017}}</ref>  Because of fears over Cohan's failing health, Warner Brothers moved up the scheduled gala premiere from July 4 to May 29; the original date had been chosen because of the film's patriotic theme and because Cohan really had been born on the Fourth of July as he wrote in the lyrics of his \"Yankee Doodle Dandy.\" In the end, Cohan lived for several more months after the film's release.\n\nThe [[movie poster]] for this film was the first ever produced by noted poster designer [[Bill Gold]].\n\n==Musical numbers==\n# '''\"Overture\"''' \u2013 Played by Orchestra behind titles.\n# '''\"Keep Your Eyes Upon Me (The Dancing Master)\"''' \u2013 Sung and Danced by Walter Huston, then Sung and Danced by Henry Blair.\n# '''\"[[While Strolling Through the Park One Day]]\"''' \u2013 Sung and Danced by Jo Ann Marlowe.\n# '''\"At a Georgia Camp Meeting\"''' \u2013 Danced by James Cagney, Walter Huston, Rosemary DeCamp and Jeanne Cagney.\n# '''\"I Was Born in Virginia\"''' \u2013 Sung and Danced by James Cagney, Jeanne Cagney, Walter Huston and Rosemary DeCamp.\n# '''\"The Warmest Baby in the Bunch\"''' \u2013 Sung and Danced by Joan Leslie (dubbed by Sally Sweetland).\n# '''\"[[Harrigan (song)|Harrigan]]\"''' \u2013 Sung and Danced by James Cagney and Joan Leslie.\n# '''\"[[The Yankee Doodle Boy]]\"''' \u2013 Sung and Danced by James Cagney, Joan Leslie (dubbed by Sally Sweetland) and Chorus.\n# '''\"[[Give My Regards To Broadway]]\"''' \u2013 Sung and Danced by James Cagney and Chorus.\n# '''\"Oh You Wonderful Girl / Blue Skies, Gray Skies / The Belle of the Barbers' Ball\"''' \u2013 Sung by James Cagney, Jeanne Cagney, Walter Huston and Rosemary DeCamp.\n# '''\"[[Mary's a Grand Old Name]]\"''' \u2013 Sung by Joan Leslie (dubbed by Sally Sweetland).\n# '''\"[[Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway]]\"''' \u2013 Sung by James Cagney.\n# '''\"[[Mary's a Grand Old Name]]\"''' (reprise 1) \u2013 Sung by Joan Leslie (dubbed by Sally Sweetland).\n# '''\"[[Mary's a Grand Old Name]]\"''' (reprise 2) \u2013 Sung by Irene Manning.\n# '''\"[[Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway]]\"''' (reprise) \u2013 Sung by Chorus.\n# '''\"So Long, Mary\"''' \u2013 Sung by Irene Manning and Chorus.\n# '''\"[[You're a Grand Old Flag]]\"''' \u2013 Performed by James Cagney and Chorus.\n# '''\"Like the Wandering Minstrel\"''' \u2013 Sung by James Cagney and Chorus.\n# '''\"[[Over There]]\"''' \u2013 Sung by Frances Langford, James Cagney and Chorus.\n# '''\"A George M.

Cohan's life, having disliked Cohan since the Actors' Equity Strike in 1919, in which he sided with the producers. In 1940, Cagney was named, along with 15 other Hollywood figures, in the grand jury testimony of John R. Leech, the self-described 'chief functionary' of the Los Angeles Communist Party who had been subpoenaed by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' printed the allegation that Cagney was a communist on its front page. Cagney refuted the accusation and [[Martin Dies, Jr.]] made a statement to the press clearing Cagney. [[William Cagney]], one of the film's producers, is reported to have said to his brother that \"we're going to have to make the goddamndest patriotic picture that's ever been made.

Joan Leslie's singing voice was partially dubbed by [[Sally Sweetland]].\n\nThe film was written by [[Robert Buckner]] and Edmund Joseph, and directed by [[Michael Curtiz]].  According to the special edition DVD, significant and uncredited improvements were made to the script by the twin brothers [[Julius J. Epstein]] and [[Philip G. Epstein]].\n\nIn 1993, ''Yankee Doodle Dandy''  was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early days of [[World War II]], Cohan comes out of retirement to star as President Roosevelt in the [[Rodgers and Hart]] musical ''[[I'd Rather Be Right]].'' On the first night, he is summoned to meet the president at the [[White House]], who presents him with a [[Congressional Gold Medal]] (though the Cohan character on screen incorrectly identifies the award as the [[Congressional Medal of Honor]]). Cohan is overcome and chats with Roosevelt, recalling his early days on the stage. The film flashes back to his supposed birth on July 4, whilst his father is performing on the [[vaudeville]] stage.\n\nCohan and his sister join the family act as soon as they can learn to dance, and soon The Four Cohans are performing successfully. But George gets too cocky as he grows up and is blacklisted by theatrical producers for being troublesome. He leaves the act and hawks his songs unsuccessfully around to producers. In partnership with [[Sam H. Harris|Sam Harris]], another struggling writer, he finally interests a producer and they are on the road to success. He also marries Mary, a young singer/dancer.\n\nAs his star ascends, he persuades his now struggling parents to join his act, eventually vesting some of his valuable theatrical properties in their name.\n\nCohan retires, but returns to the stage several times, culminating in the role of the U.S. president. As he leaves the White House, after receiving the Congressional Gold Medal from the president, he descends a set of stairs while performing a tap dance (which Cagney thought up before the scene was filmed and undertook without rehearsal). Outside, he joins a military parade, where the soldiers are singing \"[[Over There]]\", and, at first, he isn't singing. Not knowing that Cohan is the song's composer, one of them asks if he knows the words. Cohan's response is a smile before joining in to sing too.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[James Cagney]] as [[George M.

In one scene, after Cohan suffers a flop with an atypical non-musical drama, \"Popularity,\" he composes a telegram apologizing to the public. He then walks out of the [[Western Union]] office to find newspaper sellers announcing the [[Sinking_of_the_RMS_Lusitania|torpedoing of the Lusitania]]. In reality, the failed play was staged in 1906, and the Lusitania's sinking occurred in 1915.<ref>https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/george-m-cohan-5829</ref>\n\nNevertheless, care was taken to make the sets, costumes, and dance steps match the original stage presentations. Twice, Cagney sprained an ankle while mastering Cohan's stiff-legged dance style. This effort was aided significantly by a former associate of Cohan's, Jack Boyle, who knew the original productions well. Boyle also appeared in the film in some of the dancing groups.\n\nCagney, as Cohan, is shown performing as a singing and dancing version of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Although it was well known, the reality of Roosevelt's use of a wheelchair after [[polio]] was not emphasized at the time. In the film, Roosevelt never leaves his chair when meeting Cohan.\n\nCohan himself served as a consultant during the production of the film. Due to his failing health, his actual involvement in the film was rather limited.  However, Cohan did see the film before he died (from cancer) and approved of Cagney's portrayal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/24022%7C0/Yankee-Doodle-Dandy.html|title=Yankee Doodle Dandy|website=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=23 September 2017}}</ref>  Because of fears over Cohan's failing health, Warner Brothers moved up the scheduled gala premiere from July 4 to May 29; the original date had been chosen because of the film's patriotic theme and because Cohan really had been born on the Fourth of July as he wrote in the lyrics of his \"Yankee Doodle Dandy.\" In the end, Cohan lived for several more months after the film's release.\n\nThe [[movie poster]] for this film was the first ever produced by noted poster designer [[Bill Gold]].\n\n==Musical numbers==\n# '''\"Overture\"''' \u2013 Played by Orchestra behind titles.\n# '''\"Keep Your Eyes Upon Me (The Dancing Master)\"''' \u2013 Sung and Danced by Walter Huston, then Sung and Danced by Henry Blair.\n# '''\"[[While Strolling Through the Park One Day]]\"''' \u2013 Sung and Danced by Jo Ann Marlowe.\n# '''\"At a Georgia Camp Meeting\"''' \u2013 Danced by James Cagney, Walter Huston, Rosemary DeCamp and Jeanne Cagney.\n# '''\"I Was Born in Virginia\"''' \u2013 Sung and Danced by James Cagney, Jeanne Cagney, Walter Huston and Rosemary DeCamp.\n# '''\"The Warmest Baby in the Bunch\"''' \u2013 Sung and Danced by Joan Leslie (dubbed by Sally Sweetland).\n# '''\"[[Harrigan (song)|Harrigan]]\"''' \u2013 Sung and Danced by James Cagney and Joan Leslie.\n# '''\"[[The Yankee Doodle Boy]]\"''' \u2013 Sung and Danced by James Cagney, Joan Leslie (dubbed by Sally Sweetland) and Chorus.\n# '''\"[[Give My Regards To Broadway]]\"''' \u2013 Sung and Danced by James Cagney and Chorus.\n# '''\"Oh You Wonderful Girl / Blue Skies, Gray Skies / The Belle of the Barbers' Ball\"''' \u2013 Sung by James Cagney, Jeanne Cagney, Walter Huston and Rosemary DeCamp.\n# '''\"[[Mary's a Grand Old Name]]\"''' \u2013 Sung by Joan Leslie (dubbed by Sally Sweetland).\n# '''\"[[Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway]]\"''' \u2013 Sung by James Cagney.\n# '''\"[[Mary's a Grand Old Name]]\"''' (reprise 1) \u2013 Sung by Joan Leslie (dubbed by Sally Sweetland).\n# '''\"[[Mary's a Grand Old Name]]\"''' (reprise 2) \u2013 Sung by Irene Manning.\n# '''\"[[Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway]]\"''' (reprise) \u2013 Sung by Chorus.\n# '''\"So Long, Mary\"''' \u2013 Sung by Irene Manning and Chorus.\n# '''\"[[You're a Grand Old Flag]]\"''' \u2013 Performed by James Cagney and Chorus.\n# '''\"Like the Wandering Minstrel\"''' \u2013 Sung by James Cagney and Chorus.\n# '''\"[[Over There]]\"''' \u2013 Sung by Frances Langford, James Cagney and Chorus.\n# '''\"A George M.

Cohan's life, having disliked Cohan since the Actors' Equity Strike in 1919, in which he sided with the producers. In 1940, Cagney was named, along with 15 other Hollywood figures, in the grand jury testimony of John R. Leech, the self-described 'chief functionary' of the Los Angeles Communist Party who had been subpoenaed by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' printed the allegation that Cagney was a communist on its front page. Cagney refuted the accusation and [[Martin Dies, Jr.]] made a statement to the press clearing Cagney. [[William Cagney]], one of the film's producers, is reported to have said to his brother that \"we're going to have to make the goddamndest patriotic picture that's ever been made. I think it's the Cohan story\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=McGilligan|first1=Patrick|title=Cagney: The Actor as Auteur|date=1982|publisher=A.S.
