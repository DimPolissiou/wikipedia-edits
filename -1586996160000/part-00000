She is primarily known for her work with [[Leonor Michaelis]] on enzyme kinetics and co-authored [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics|Michaelis\u2013Menten equation]] in 1913. \n\nMaud Menten was born in [[Port Lambton, Ontario]] and studied medicine at the [[University of Toronto]] (B.A. 1904, M.B. 1907, M.D. 1911, Ph.D., 1916). She was among the first women in Canada to earn a medical doctorate.<ref name=\"Can Med Hall Fame\" /> She completed her thesis work at [[University of Chicago]]. At that time women were not allowed to do research in Canada, so she decided to do research in other countries such as the United States and Germany.\n\nIn 1912 she moved to [[Berlin]] where she worked with [[Leonor Michaelis]] and co-authored their paper in ''Biochemische Zeitschrift''<ref name=\"Michaelis-Menten equation paper\" /> which showed that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the amount of the enzyme-substrate complex. This relationship between reaction rate and enzyme\u2013substrate concentration is known as the [[Michaelis\u2013Menten equation]]. \n\nAfter studying with Michaelis in Germany she entered graduate school at the [[University of Chicago]] where she obtained her PhD in 1916.<ref name=\"Profile\">{{cite web |title=Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/leonor-michaelis-and-maud-leonora-menten |website=[[Science History Institute]]|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref> Her dissertation was titled \"The Alkalinity of the Blood in Malignancy and Other Pathological Conditions; Together with Observations on the Relation of the Alkalinity of the Blood to Barometric Pressure\".

After completing secondary school, Menten attended the University of Toronto where she earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1904 and a master's degree in physiology in 1907. While earning her graduate degree, she worked as a demonstrator in the university's physiology lab.\n\nAs Menten wanted to further her medical research, she found that opportunities in Canada were scarce for women at the time. As a result she accepted a fellowship at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research and left for in New York City in 1907; there she studied the effect of radium bromide on cancerous tumors in rats.<ref name=\"Miss Menten\" /> Menten and two other scientists published the results of their experiment, producing the Rockefeller Institute's first monograph.<ref name=\"Miss Menten\" /><ref name=Monograph>{{cite book|last1=Jobling|first1=J W|last2=Flexner|first2=Simon|last3=Menten|first3=Maud L|title=Tumors of animals|date=1910|publisher=[[Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]]}}</ref>  Menten worked as an intern at the New York Infirmary for Women and Children. After a year at the Institute, Menten returned to Canada and began her studies at the University of Toronto where in 1911 she became one of the first Canadian women to qualify as a medical doctor.<ref name=\"Miss Menten\" />\n\n== The Michaelis-Menten Equation ==\nIn 1912, Menten came back to medical research, working with renowned surgeon [[George Washington Crile|George Crile]] on the control of acid-base balance during anaesthesia. Around this time she became acquainted with Leonor Michaelis, he was known then as one of the world-leading experts in pH and buffers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/diversity/175-faces/all-faces/professor-maud-l-menten/|title=Maud Menten was a biochemical and medical researcher who co-devised one of the fundamental models in enzyme kinetics.|last=Winship|first=Douglas|date=May 2015|website=Royal Society of Chemistry}}</ref> Menten became attracted to Michaelis' early work in [[enzyme kinetics]], despite his modest laboratory establishment in Berlin, and made the difficult decision to cross the sea to work with Michaelis. Menten's early years in Germany was met with financial and social hardships, she took a paid position at a Berlin hospital to cover her living and travel expense as well as beginning to learn German when she first came to Berlin.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom 1905 to 1921, Michaelis and Menten succeeded in expressing mathematically the relationship they were investigating, which demonstrated that each enzyme not only has its own substrate but also that at sufficient concentrations of substrate it has its own rate of causing that substrate to change chemically. One of the constants used in expressing this rate is now called the Michaelis-Menten constant.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/leonor-michaelis-and-maud-leonora-menten|title=Leonor Michaelis and Maud Leonora Menten|date=December 12, 2017}}</ref>The [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics|Michaelis\u2013Menten]] equations, is considered her most famous work  with Michaelis,<ref name=\"Michaelis-Menten equation paper\" /> based on earlier findings of Victor Henri.\n\n== Other work ==\nAfter her research in Berlin, Menten enrolled in University of Chicago, where in 1916 she obtained a PhD in biochemistry. In 1923, Menten still could not find an academic position for women in Canada; she took a position as part of the faculty of the medical school at the University of Pittsburgh while serving as a clinical pathologist at Children\u2019s Hospital in Pittsburgh. Despite the demands both jobs had, Menten found time to maintained an active research program, authoring or coauthoring more than 70 publications. Although her promotion from assistant to associate professor was timely, she was not made a full professor until she was 70 years old, within one year of retirement.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMenten also invented the azo-dye coupling reaction for [[alkaline phosphatase]], which is still used in histochemistry. She characterised bacterial toxins from ''B. paratyphosus'', ''Streptococcus scarlatina'' and ''[[Salmonella]] ssp.'' that were used in a successful immunisation program against scarlet fever in Pittsburgh in the 1930s - 1940s.<ref name=\"PittsburghPressNoScareletFever\">{{cite news|title=Scarlet fever deaths avoided in city|date=May 19, 1942|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press}}</ref>  She also conducted the first [[electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] separation of blood haemoglobin proteins in 1944.

She is primarily known for her work with [[Leonor Michaelis]] on enzyme kinetics and co-authored [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics|Michaelis\u2013Menten equation]] in 1913. \n\nMaud Menten was born in [[Port Lambton, Ontario]] and studied medicine at the [[University of Toronto]] (B.A. 1904, M.B. 1907, M.D. 1911, Ph.D., 1916). She was among the first women in Canada to earn a medical doctorate.<ref name=\"Can Med Hall Fame\" /> She completed her thesis work at [[University of Chicago]]. At that time women were not allowed to do research in Canada, so she decided to do research in other countries such as the United States and Germany.\n\nIn 1912 she moved to [[Berlin]] where she worked with [[Leonor Michaelis]] and co-authored their paper in ''Biochemische Zeitschrift''<ref name=\"Michaelis-Menten equation paper\" /> which showed that the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is proportional to the amount of the enzyme-substrate complex. This relationship between reaction rate and enzyme\u2013substrate concentration is known as the [[Michaelis\u2013Menten equation]]. \n\nAfter studying with Michaelis in Germany she entered graduate school at the [[University of Chicago]] where she obtained her PhD in 1916.<ref name=\"Profile\">{{cite web |title=Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/leonor-michaelis-and-maud-leonora-menten |website=[[Science History Institute]]|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref> Her dissertation was titled \"The Alkalinity of the Blood in Malignancy and Other Pathological Conditions; Together with Observations on the Relation of the Alkalinity of the Blood to Barometric Pressure\".

After completing secondary school, Menten attended the University of Toronto where she earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1904 and a master's degree in physiology in 1907. While earning her graduate degree, she worked as a demonstrator in the university's physiology lab.\n\nAs Menten wanted to further her medical research, she found that opportunities in Canada were scarce for women at the time. As a result she accepted a fellowship at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research and left for in New York City in 1907; there she studied the effect of radium bromide on cancerous tumors in rats.<ref name=\"Miss Menten\" /> Menten and two other scientists published the results of their experiment, producing the Rockefeller Institute's first monograph.<ref name=\"Miss Menten\" /><ref name=Monograph>{{cite book|last1=Jobling|first1=J W|last2=Flexner|first2=Simon|last3=Menten|first3=Maud L|title=Tumors of animals|date=1910|publisher=[[Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]]}}</ref>  Menten worked as an intern at the New York Infirmary for Women and Children. After a year at the Institute, Menten returned to Canada and began her studies at the University of Toronto where in 1911 she became one of the first Canadian women to qualify as a medical doctor.<ref name=\"Miss Menten\" />\n\n== The Michaelis-Menten Equation ==\nIn 1912, Menten came back to medical research, working with renowned surgeon [[George Washington Crile|George Crile]] on the control of acid-base balance during anaesthesia. Around this time she became acquainted with Leonor Michaelis, he was known then as one of the world-leading experts in pH and buffers<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/diversity/175-faces/all-faces/professor-maud-l-menten/|title=Maud Menten was a biochemical and medical researcher who co-devised one of the fundamental models in enzyme kinetics.|last=Winship|first=Douglas|date=May 2015|website=Royal Society of Chemistry}}</ref>. Menten became attracted to Michaelis' early work in [[enzyme kinetics]], despite his modest laboratory establishment in Berlin, and made the difficult decision to cross the sea to work with Michaelis. Menten's early years in Germany was met with financial and social hardships, she took a paid position at a Berlin hospital to cover her living and travel expense as well as beginning to learn German when she first came to Berlin.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom 1905 to 1921, Michaelis and Menten succeeded in expressing mathematically the relationship they were investigating, which demonstrated that each enzyme not only has its own substrate but also that at sufficient concentrations of substrate it has its own rate of causing that substrate to change chemically. One of the constants used in expressing this rate is now called the Michaelis-Menten constant.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/leonor-michaelis-and-maud-leonora-menten|title=Leonor Michaelis and Maud Leonora Menten|date=December 12, 2017}}</ref>The [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics|Michaelis\u2013Menten]] equations, is considered her most famous work  with Michaelis,<ref name=\"Michaelis-Menten equation paper\" /> based on earlier findings of Victor Henri.\n\n== Other work ==\nAfter her research in Berlin, Menten enrolled in University of Chicago, where in 1916 she obtained a PhD in biochemistry. In 1923, Menten still could not find an academic position for women in Canada; she took a position as part of the faculty of the medical school at the University of Pittsburgh while serving as a clinical pathologist at Children\u2019s Hospital in Pittsburgh. Despite the demands both jobs had, Menten found time to maintained an active research program, authoring or coauthoring more than 70 publications. Although her promotion from assistant to associate professor was timely, she was not made a full professor until she was 70 years old, within one year of retirement.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMenten also invented the azo-dye coupling reaction for [[alkaline phosphatase]], which is still used in histochemistry. She characterised bacterial toxins from ''B. paratyphosus'', ''Streptococcus scarlatina'' and ''[[Salmonella]] ssp.'' that were used in a successful immunisation program against scarlet fever in Pittsburgh in the 1930s - 1940s.<ref name=\"PittsburghPressNoScareletFever\">{{cite news|title=Scarlet fever deaths avoided in city|date=May 19, 1942|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press}}</ref>  She also conducted the first [[electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] separation of blood haemoglobin proteins in 1944. She worked on the properties of [[hemoglobin]], regulation of [[blood sugar]] level, and kidney function.<ref name=\"Nature obit\" /> \n\nAfter her retirement from the University of Pittsburgh in 1950, she returned to Canada where she continued to do cancer research at the British Columbia Medical Research Institute (1951&ndash;1953). \n\nPoor health forced Menten's retirement in 1955, and she died July 17, 1960, at the age of 81, in [[Leamington, Ontario]].<ref name=\"Miss Menten\" /><ref name=\"Can Med Hall Fame\" />\n\n==Personal life==\n\n[[Rebecca Skloot]] portrays Menten as a petite dynamo of a woman who wore \"Paris hats, blue dresses with stained-glass hues, and Buster Brown shoes.\"<ref name=\"Miss Menten\" /> She drove a Model T Ford through the University of Pittsburgh area for some 32 years and enjoyed many adventurous and artistic hobbies. She played the clarinet, painted paintings worthy of art exhibitions,<ref name=\"Can Med Hall Fame\" /> climbed mountains, went on an Arctic expedition, and enjoyed astronomy.

He served in the Senate from 1869 to 1875 and again from 1879 to 1881.<ref>{{cite book |last=Heg |first=J. E. |date=1881 |title=Wisconsin Blue Book |url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&entity=WI.WIBlueBk1881.p0543&id=WI.WIBlueBk1881&isize=M |location=Madison, WI |publisher=W. J. Park, State Printer |page=487}}</ref> Recognized as an authority on [[constitutional law]], he made some of the most important legal arguments of 19th-century America. Carpenter presented cases before the [[U. S. Supreme Court]] involving such matters as [[states' rights]] and regulation of [[corporations]].\n \nOriginally a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he evolved into a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] during the [[Civil War (United States)|Civil War]], and helped perpetuate the party's political machinery in Wisconsin. His sustained support for President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s administration despite allegations of corruption lost him the backing of reformers, and his legal arguments in favor of Democratic candidate [[Samuel J. Tilden]] in the disputed [[presidential election of 1876]] outraged many Republicans. A gifted orator, he was dubbed \"the [[Daniel Webster|Webster]] of the West.\"\n\n==Background and education==\nCarpenter was born in [[Moretown, Vermont]] in the [[Mad River (Vermont)|Mad River]] Valley of the [[Green Mountains|Green Mountain]] range. His pioneering forebears were English, and came to America soon after the [[Pilgrims]]. His grandfather Cephas Carpenter (1770\u20131860)<ref name=\"yb\">{{cite book |date=1896 |title=Year Book of the Wisconsin Society of the Sons of the American Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bv4QAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA49 |location=Milwaukee, Wis. |publisher=Swain & Tate Company |page=49}}</ref> helped establish Moretown, owned a store, served as a colonel in the militia and took part in the [[War of 1812]].  Cephas Carpenter served in local office including justice of the peace, and though not a member of the bar, possessed wisdom and eloquence that led to a career as an advocate in the local courts.\n\nHis son Ira Carpenter (1798\u20131862)<ref name=\"yb\"/> was chiefly a farmer, but he also gained prominence through positions such as justice of the peace, postmaster and state legislator.\n\nGrandson Merritt displayed intelligence and oratorical talents at an early age, impressing people with his abilities to recite [[Cicero]] and \"exhort\" at religious revivals. He also displayed an aversion to physical work.<ref>Thompson, p.3\u201310</ref> \n\nAfter an explosive argument with a schoolmaster, the 13-year-old Carpenter was expelled from school. He was dissatisfied with the limits of Moretown, and left home to live and study law under the tutelage of family friend (and future Vermont governor) [[Paul Dillingham]] in nearby [[Waterbury (village), Vermont|Waterbury]]. For four years Carpenter attended the local grade school while absorbing Dillingham's law library. Having received an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] through Vermont Congressman [[John Mattocks]], Carpenter continued his studies, but he disliked military life and resigned in August 1845, citing poor health.<ref>Thompson, pp. 11-15.</ref>\n\nHe returned to live in Dillingham's home and managed his law office while Dillingham was then a congressman in Washington, D.C. Upon Carpenter's admission to the Vermont bar in November 1847 Dillingham offered to make him his law partner, but Carpenter declined so he could further his law studies under [[Rufus Choate]] of [[Boston]]. Choate was also impressed with Carpenter, and after a few months he too offered him a partnership, but Carpenter sought to make a name and career for himself in the West.<ref>Thompson, pp. 15-21.</ref>\n\n==Wisconsin attorney==\nAfter reading that the territory of Wisconsin had passed its constitution and was soon to become a state, Carpenter chose to migrate west and begin his career as a lawyer in [[Beloit, Wisconsin|Beloit]] on the endorsement of that spot by the New England Emigrating Society's Dr. Horace C. White. Arriving in June 1848, Carpenter quickly established a reputation as a successful and affordable attorney, attracting much acclaim from the local community.\n\nHis practice was interrupted by a painful inflammation of his eyes which rendered him blind. After traveling to New York to seek treatment, his sight gradually recovered after a year as he convalesced in the Waterbury home of his mentor Dillingham. Before returning to Wisconsin he became engaged to Dillingham's daughter Catherine, and they married five years later.<ref>Thompson, pp. 21-29.</ref>\n\nIn 1850 Carpenter returned to resume his law practice in Beloit using a new name, Matthew (Matt) Hale Carpenter, after [[Sir Matthew Hale]], the noted English jurist of the 17th century.<ref>Thompson, pp. 33-34.</ref> Despite an earlier warning from Choate to steer clear of politics, Carpenter successfully ran for [[Rock County, Wisconsin|Rock County]] district attorney, serving from 1850 to 1852 and 1854 to 1856. He was a Democrat in the tradition of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Andrew Jackson]], but he disdained the party's pro-slavery platform while also rejecting [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] notions of opposing slavery based on \"higher law\"\u2014the idea that individual belief of right and wrong permitted an individual to violate objectionable statutes and ordinances.<ref>Thompson, pp. 31-33.</ref> After appearing to lose a close election for another term as Rock County district attorney in 1854, Carpenter successfully argued that courts could look beyond election board certifications and re-examine voter returns, resulting in the election being overturned.<ref>Thompson, p. 35.</ref>\n\n==''Gardner v. Tisdale''==\nIn 1855 Carpenter discovered that many Beloit residents did not hold legal title to their land because it was sold to them by someone who had [[Pre-emption right|pre-empted]] the land but had not received official title from the government ([[Congress of the United States|Congress]] had previously outlawed the pre-emption of non-agricultural land). Carpenter put forth the theory that the original pre-emptor was still technically the owner of the property.  After several complicated transactions, some of which included Paul Dillingham selling new titles to the landowners, and appeals as far as the [[United States Supreme Court]], which included participation by Dillingham, Rufus Choate, [[Abraham Lincoln]] and other prominent attorneys, Carpenter's legal theory was rejected in a similar case, so the Wisconsin case was withdrawn.<ref>Thompson, pp. 37-39.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Brown |first=William Fiske |date=1908 |title=Rock County, Wisconsin: A New History |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LUEVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=%22Gardner+vs.+Tisdale%22+titles#v=onepage&q=%22Gardner%20vs.%20Tisdale%22%20titles&f=false |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=C. F. Cooper & Co. |pages=157\u2013158}}</ref>\n\n==Barstow-Bashford election dispute==\nWisconsin's gubernatorial election of 1855 was thrown into doubt when incumbent Democratic governor [[William A. Barstow]] was ruled the 157-vote victor over Republican [[Coles Bashford]] by a board of canvassers friendly to Barstow. Discrepancies were discovered in the election returns and political tensions rose as both parties claimed the office and swore in their candidates. Hired by Barstow, Carpenter stalled by repeatedly postponing the case before the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court|state supreme court]]. He claimed that they held no [[jurisdiction]] because elections were matters of the [[Executive branch of the United States|executive branch]], which had ruled Barstow the winner. Nevertheless, the court did claim jurisdiction and the ability to examine election tallies (as Carpenter had previously argued for his own election for district attorney). Barstow then resigned, elevating Lieutenant Governor [[Arthur MacArthur, Sr.|Arthur MacArthur]] to the governorship. After the court ruled that Bashford was the rightful governor, MacArthur gave up the office. Barstow subsequently refused to pay Carpenter his fee.<ref>Thompson, pp. 40-45.</ref>\n\nDespite his defeat Carpenter had demonstrated his legal prowess to the state. A high volume of his cases required his presence in federal court in [[Milwaukee]], leading to him locating his practice there in 1858. He was also coaxed there by Democratic party boss Josiah Noonan, who arranged a law partnership between Carpenter and [[Edward George Ryan|Edward G. Ryan]], another highly regarded attorney and a force in the state Democratic Party. Despite their excellent credentials, they proved to be temperamentally incompatible, and ended their partnership the next year.<ref>Thompson, pp. 46-52.</ref>\n\nBy the time Carpenter moved to Milwaukee he had become adept in the area of railroad litigation and sued many railroads on behalf of investors left holding bonds made worthless by fraudulent manipulation. His debut before the U.S. Supreme Court resulted in his winning a judgment against the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company.<ref>Thompson, pp. 54-61.</ref> He was also successful as part of a team of lawyers defending abolitionist [[Sherman Booth]] from a charge of rape.<ref>Thompson, pp. 61-62.</ref>\n\n==Loyal Democrat during the Civil War==\nCarpenter supported Democrat Stephen Douglas in the 1860 presidential election, viewing Republican Abraham Lincoln as an honest but incompetent sectional candidate. Yet, he warned those in his party that he saw secession as treason, and he would be \"the first man to raise a musket\" in defense of the Constitution.<ref>Thompson, pp. 62-63.</ref> Following the Confederates' attack on Fort Sumter in 1861, Carpenter did not enlist but became a rousing speaker in support of the Union cause.<ref>Thompson, p. 65.</ref>\n\nWhile he saw that many federal actions would be unconstitutional in peacetime, he reasoned that arbitrary arrests and suspensions of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' were acts of self-preservation during wartime and thereby permitted.<ref>Thompson, pp. 64-65.</ref> He also became an early advocate for emancipation, but only as a war measure rather than an act of humanity.<ref>Thompson, p. 66.</ref> Excluded from meetings of the Democratic leadership, Carpenter joined other like-minded party members of the \"Loyal Democracy\" in considering a third party in Wisconsin, but nothing came of it.<ref>Thompson, pp. 72-78.</ref>\n\nPersonal letters he had written saying Lincoln was \"idiotic\" found their way into newspapers, but Carpenter supported him for re-election in 1864 by making numerous pro-Union and pro-Lincoln speeches.<ref>Thompson, pp. 79-82.</ref>\n\n==Defining the Reconstruction Acts==\nCarpenter was the key attorney in a series of landmark cases before the U.S. Supreme Court which helped define states' rights by determining the legality of the [[Reconstruction Acts|Reconstruction acts]] passed by Congress.\n\n''[[Ex parte Garland]]'' dealt with the disbarment from federal courts of Southern lawyers who refused to take an oath swearing they had not taken up arms or assisted the Confederacy. Carpenter argued that the act passed on January 24, 1865 was [[ex post facto]] (the war had since ended) and a [[bill of attainder]] (it punished without a trial). In December 1865 the court upheld his argument with the majority opinion employing phrases from Carpenter's brief.<ref>Thompson, pp. 89-90.</ref>\n\n''[[Ex parte McCardle]]'' concerned the legal authority of the occupying Union Army. Confederate Colonel William L. McCardle, the editor of the ''Vicksburg Times'', was charged with defying military authority by inciting rebellion, libeling federal officials, and intimidating voters. After the circuit court denied him a writ of [[habeas corpus]], McCardle appealed to the Supreme Court. Carpenter argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over a president's official acts, as in a similar case of his, ''Georgia vs. Grant''. Rather than claiming the Union's \"[[right of conquest]],\" Carpenter said the Southern states had surrendered their constitutional protections when they had seceded, essentially reverting to territories.<ref>Thompson, pp. 91-98.</ref>\n\nAfter he concluded his eloquent arguments, Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]] hugged him, declaring \"Carpenter, you have saved us!\" Even McCardle's attorney [[Jeremiah S. Black]] lauded him as \"the first Constitutional lawyer in the country.\" However, [[Radical Republicans]] in Congress feared that the reconstruction acts would be ruled unconstitutional, so they quickly pushed through a law repealing the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867, barring jurisdiction in pending cases and preventing a clear decision from being rendered by the court.<ref>Thompson, pp. 98-99.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Slaughterhouse cases]] Carpenter represented the Crescent City Livestock Landing and Slaughterhouse Company, which had been granted a monopoly on all slaughterhouse business in [[New Orleans]] by the [[carpetbagger|carpetbag]] state legislature of [[Louisiana]] in 1869. Butchers and cattle dealers thrown out of work by the law obtained an injunction from a district court, claiming they had been denied [[equal protection]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and deprived of property under the due process clause. Making a plea for states' rights, Carpenter contended that the amendment had been intended solely to elevate African Americans and had no bearing on economic statutes passed by a state. He also warned of too many powers being centralized in the federal government. The court concurred in Carpenter's narrowing of the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment.<ref>Thompson, pp. 100-102.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Bradwell vs. Illinois]]'', Carpenter sought to broaden the amendment's protections in the case of the editor of the [[Chicago]] ''Legal News'', [[Myra Bradwell]], who had been denied admission to the bar of the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] because she was a woman. Representing Bradwell, Carpenter argued that no class of people could be excluded from practicing the legal profession. The federal court disagreed, questioning the propriety of ruling on a state's qualifications for admission to the bar.<ref>Thompson, pp. 102-103.</ref>\n\nThese cases brought Carpenter handsome fees, national acclaim, and much derision from the losing factions. He'd also won the support of Stanton and President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who both urged him to run as a Republican for the U.S. Senate.<ref>Thompson, p. 99.</ref>\n\n==Republican senator==\nFollowing the Civil War Carpenter's transformation from a [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian Democrat]] into a Republican was complete. Despite reports that he backed [[President Andrew Johnson]]'s policies, he made speeches supporting the Radical congress. He called for the enfranchisement of African-American men and invited members of the Loyal Democracy to join the Republicans, as he himself did in the summer of 1867 with his support for Governor [[Lucius Fairchild]]'s re-election.\n\nWith high-profile backing Carpenter ran successfully for the senate seat occupied by [[James R. Doolittle]], a \"Johnsonized\" Republican who had fallen out of favor with his party.<ref>Thompson, pp. 105-117.</ref> With his victory he solidified his status with the \"Madison Regency,\" a Republican group that included former governor and Johnson's Postmaster General [[Alexander Randall]], Madison postmaster [[Elisha W. Keyes]] and ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'' editor and Republican state central committee chairman [[Horace Rublee]].<ref>Thompson, p. 112.</ref> After Rublee was appointed minister to [[Switzerland]] by President Grant, Keyes became party chairman and closely coordinated with Carpenter to distribute federal patronage jobs to political allies.\n\nOnce in the Senate, Carpenter moderated his views to the degree that he became one of the spokesmen of the emerging Stalwart Republicans. He opposed any \"fundamental conditions\" placed on states wishing to be readmitted to the Union, and favored blanket amnesty for former Confederates.<ref>Thompson, pp. 133-138.</ref> Carpenter was known as one of the staunchest supporters of the corrupt Grant administration.<ref>Thompson, pp. 148-149.</ref> In the Senate he presented an unabashed defense of political patronage, mocking the idea of civil service reform.<ref>Thompson, pp. 156-160.</ref> He also feuded with [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]] senators [[Charles Sumner]] and [[Carl Schurz]] over many issues. He delivered a sarcastic denunciation of Sumner's wide-reaching civil rights amendment to the Confederate amnesty bill.<ref>Thompson, pp. 160-164.</ref> As the chair of an investigating committee he also debunked Sumner and Schurz's claim that the War Department had broken its neutrality when it sold outmoded rifles to [[France]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]].<ref>Thompson, pp. 166-171.</ref> Despite such skirmishes Carpenter was a respected figure in the senate, being elected president pro tempore by his colleagues in 1871. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills ([[42nd United States Congress|42nd Congress]]) and the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expense (42nd and [[43rd United States Congress|43rd Congresses]]).\n\nAs part of another committee inquiry, Carpenter went to [[Louisiana]] to investigate election claims in order to determine the rightful governor of the contested state. His report was highly critical of both factions, but he urged the recognition of Republican governor [[William P. Kellogg]].<ref>Thompson, pp. 178-191.</ref> Years later Carpenter's impartiality was called into question when personal letters revealed a close relationship between the two, including a \"desperately short\" Carpenter asking Kellogg for a $1,000 loan.<ref>Thompson, pp. 222-223.</ref>\n\n==Drawing fire from press and party==\nAs Carpenter's influence grew within the Grant administration, so did the condemnations from the press. One of his Senate investigations resulted in two journalists being jailed for not divulging the source of a leaked treaty.<ref>Thompson, pp. 149-154.</ref> Opposition newspapers like the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' responded by not only criticizing Carpenter's methods, but by also condemning his moral character by bringing his private life into question.<ref>Thompson, pp. 200-202.</ref> Later in his term editors accused Carpenter of trying to effectively \"gag\" newspapers by advancing a bill that would allow judicial process to be served upon the agents (i.e. interviewers) of persons involved in civil suits.<ref>Thompson, pp. 215-216.</ref>\n\nIn 1873 Carpenter angered many in his own party by taking positions that ran counter to the stalwart doctrine. In a spirit of reform he boldly owned up to administration excesses such as the [[Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier of America scandal|Credit Mobilier]] and the \"Salary Grab,\" defending them in a speech in [[Janesville, Wisconsin|Janesville]].<ref>Thompson, pp. 193-198.</ref> In a speech at [[Ripon, Wisconsin|Ripon]] he denounced the railroads, insisting they were public highways paid for with government land grants. He also stated his belief that the government has a right as well as a duty to regulate corporations.<ref>Thompson, pp. 221-222.</ref>\n\nWishing to make the ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' into a more reliable organ for the state Republican party, Carpenter and other backers bought the paper and forced out editor [[Alexander M. Thomson]], who had been instrumental in getting Carpenter elected senator. Thomson was now deemed too critical of the party machine. His ousting made him a lifelong enemy of Carpenter. The ''Sentinel'' soon was seen as Carpenter's personal mouthpiece.<ref>Thompson, pp. 205-207</ref>\n\nDespite the incessant criticism, Carpenter was seen as being easily re-elected in 1875. Nevertheless, a surprise bolt by disgruntled Republicans combined with votes by calculating Democrats resulted in the election of [[Angus Cameron (American politician)|Angus Cameron]], a [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]] Republican.<ref>Thompson, pp. 218-230</ref>\n\n==Out of office and under scrutiny==\nIn 1875 Carpenter was implicated in the [[Whiskey Ring]] scandal that funneled federal liquor tax revenues to some states' Republican parties. Although he was close to key participants in the Milwaukee ring, no evidence emerged to prove his involvement.<ref>Thompson, pp. 233-242</ref>\n\nDuring this time he was also defending Grant's Secretary of War [[William W. Belknap]] against [[Trader post scandal|charges]] that he had accepted money in exchange for the appointment of a post trader. Despite Belknap's immediate resignation outraged House Democrats proceeded with his impeachment. Carpenter portrayed Belknap as the hapless victim of a social-climbing wife, but his legal victory relied on his assertion that jurisdiction over Belknap ended with his resignation.<ref>Thompson, pp. 243-246</ref>\n\nAlso in 1875 Carpenter was defense counsel for officials of the [[Miners\u2019 National Association]] (MNA) in an important labor case that sought to apply the legal concept of conspiracy to union picketing and organization efforts. The case grew out of a coal miners' strike in [[Clearfield County, Pennsylvania]] which was supported by the MNA, then numerically one of the largest American trade unions. First over fifty of the striking workers were tried upon a charge of criminal conspiracy and thirty-six of them were convicted with some sentenced to jail, although they appeared to have been guilty of no more than peaceful picketing. Then [[John Siney]], the president of the MNA, and Xingo Parks, one of the union\u2019s best organizers, were tried on the same charge. Siney was acquitted, but Parks convicted, although pardoned shortly thereafter.<ref>Witte, Edwin E., Early American Labor Cases, 35 Yale Law Journal 7, 1926, pp. 830-31</ref>\n\nFollowing the disputed presidential election of 1876, Carpenter was hired by supporters of the Democratic candidate [[Samuel J. Tilden]] to examine Louisiana's vote counts and argue for victory over Republican [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]. Carpenter's first-hand accounts of the corrupt Republican state administration gave the Democrats some reason for hope, but ultimately the partisan make-up of the special electoral commission (7 Republicans, 6 Democrats) and its refusal to look behind the certified counts made many of their rulings a forgone conclusive win for Hayes.<ref>Thompson, pp. 247-253</ref>\n\n==Return to the senate==\nDespite ongoing press criticism and declining health, in 1878 Carpenter launched a bid for the senate seat occupied by Republican [[Timothy Howe]]. With the help of a strong lobby, he won over enough votes in the legislature to prevail over state party boss (and former friend) Elisha W. Keyes.<ref>Thompson, pp. 254-264</ref>\n\nCarpenter's second term as senator lacked the political drama of his Reconstruction years. He spoke in favor of President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]'s maintenance of federal troops at southern polling places. He also vigorously opposed the Democrats' proposed pardoning of General [[Fitz-John Porter]] for ignoring General [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]'s orders at [[Manassas]] in 1863, arguing that the power of pardon resides solely with the president.<ref>Thompson, pp. 264-266</ref> Carpenter remained a loyal supporter of President Grant in his quest for a third term, igniting bitter debates between Carpenter and White House aspirant Senator [[James G. Blaine]] of Maine.<ref>Thompson, pp. 268-270.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nWhile Carpenter's evident declining health was attributed to his indulgent lifestyle, he also suffered from the lung congestion of [[Bright's disease]]. After a cycle of relapses and recoveries he died on February 24, 1881 at his Washington, D.C. home surrounded by friends and family. He was buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.<ref>Thompson, pp. 275-280.</ref>\n\n==Family==\nIn 1855 Carpenter married Caroline Dillingham, the daughter of Paul Dillingham.<ref>{{cite book |last=Huse |first=Hiram A. |title=A Memorial Sketch of Paul Dillingham: Officers and Members: Report of Proceedings of the Annual Meeting |volume=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99o8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA77 |location=Montpelier, VT |publisher=Argus and Patriot Book and Job Printing |page=77|year=1892 }}</ref> They were the parents of four children.

He served in the Senate from 1869 to 1875 and again from 1879 to 1881.<ref>{{cite book |last=Heg |first=J. E. |date=1881 |title=Wisconsin Blue Book |url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=turn&entity=WI.WIBlueBk1881.p0543&id=WI.WIBlueBk1881&isize=M |location=Madison, WI |publisher=W. J. Park, State Printer |page=487}}</ref> Recognized as an authority on [[constitutional law]], he made some of the most important legal arguments of 19th-century America. Carpenter presented cases before the [[U. S. Supreme Court]] involving such matters as [[states' rights]] and regulation of [[corporations]].\n \nOriginally a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he evolved into a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] during the [[Civil War (United States)|Civil War]], and helped perpetuate the party's political machinery in Wisconsin. His sustained support for President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s administration despite allegations of corruption lost him the backing of reformers, and his legal arguments in favor of Democratic candidate [[Samuel J. Tilden]] in the disputed [[presidential election of 1876]] outraged many Republicans. A gifted orator, he was dubbed \"the [[Daniel Webster|Webster]] of the West.\"\n\n==Background and education==\nCarpenter was born in [[Moretown, Vermont]] in the [[Mad River (Vermont)|Mad River]] Valley of the [[Green Mountains|Green Mountain]] range. His pioneering forebears were English, and came to America soon after the [[Pilgrims]]. His grandfather Cephas Carpenter (1770\u20131860)<ref name=\"yb\">{{cite book |date=1896 |title=Year Book of the Wisconsin Society of the Sons of the American Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bv4QAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA49 |location=Milwaukee, Wis. |publisher=Swain & Tate Company |page=49}}</ref> helped establish Moretown, owned a store, served as a colonel in the militia and took part in the [[War of 1812]].  Cephas Carpenter served in local office including justice of the peace, and though not a member of the bar, possessed wisdom and eloquence that led to a career as an advocate in the local courts.\n\nHis son Ira Carpenter (1798\u20131862)<ref name=\"yb\"/> was chiefly a farmer, but he also gained prominence through positions such as justice of the peace, postmaster and state legislator.\n\nGrandson Merritt displayed intelligence and oratorical talents at an early age, impressing people with his abilities to recite [[Cicero]] and \"exhort\" at religious revivals. He also displayed an aversion to physical work.<ref>Thompson, p.3\u201310</ref> \n\nAfter an explosive argument with a schoolmaster, the 13-year-old Carpenter was expelled from school. He was dissatisfied with the limits of Moretown, and left home to live and study law under the tutelage of family friend (and future Vermont governor) [[Paul Dillingham]] in nearby [[Waterbury (village), Vermont|Waterbury]]. For four years Carpenter attended the local grade school while absorbing Dillingham's law library. Having received an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] through Vermont Congressman [[John Mattocks]], Carpenter continued his studies, but he disliked military life and resigned in August 1845, citing poor health.<ref>Thompson, pp. 11-15.</ref>\n\nHe returned to live in Dillingham's home and managed his law office while Dillingham was then a congressman in Washington, D.C. Upon Carpenter's admission to the Vermont bar in November 1847 Dillingham offered to make him his law partner, but Carpenter declined so he could further his law studies under [[Rufus Choate]] of [[Boston]]. Choate was also impressed with Carpenter, and after a few months he too offered him a partnership, but Carpenter sought to make a name and career for himself in the West.<ref>Thompson, pp. 15-21.</ref>\n\n==Wisconsin attorney==\nAfter reading that the territory of Wisconsin had passed its constitution and was soon to become a state, Carpenter chose to migrate west and begin his career as a lawyer in [[Beloit, Wisconsin|Beloit]] on the endorsement of that spot by the New England Emigrating Society's Dr. Horace C. White. Arriving in June 1848, Carpenter quickly established a reputation as a successful and affordable attorney, attracting much acclaim from the local community.\n\nHis practice was interrupted by a painful inflammation of his eyes which rendered him blind. After traveling to New York to seek treatment, his sight gradually recovered after a year as he convalesced in the Waterbury home of his mentor Dillingham. Before returning to Wisconsin he became engaged to Dillingham's daughter Catherine, and they married five years later.<ref>Thompson, pp. 21-29.</ref>\n\nIn 1850 Carpenter returned to resume his law practice in Beloit using a new name, Matthew (Matt) Hale Carpenter, after [[Sir Matthew Hale]], the noted English jurist of the 17th century.<ref>Thompson, pp. 33-34.</ref> Despite an earlier warning from Choate to steer clear of politics, Carpenter successfully ran for [[Rock County, Wisconsin|Rock County]] district attorney, serving from 1850 to 1852 and 1854 to 1856. He was a Democrat in the tradition of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Andrew Jackson]], but he disdained the party's pro-slavery platform while also rejecting [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] notions of opposing slavery based on \"higher law\"\u2014the idea that individual belief of right and wrong permitted an individual to violate objectionable statutes and ordinances.<ref>Thompson, pp. 31-33.</ref> After appearing to lose a close election for another term as Rock County district attorney in 1854, Carpenter successfully argued that courts could look beyond election board certifications and re-examine voter returns, resulting in the election being overturned.<ref>Thompson, p. 35.</ref>\n\n==''Gardner v. Tisdale''==\nIn 1855 Carpenter discovered that many Beloit residents did not hold legal title to their land because it was sold to them by someone who had [[Pre-emption right|pre-empted]] the land but had not received official title from the government ([[Congress of the United States|Congress]] had previously outlawed the pre-emption of non-agricultural land). Carpenter put forth the theory that the original pre-emptor was still technically the owner of the property.  After several complicated transactions, some of which included Paul Dillingham selling new titles to the landowners, and appeals as far as the [[United States Supreme Court]], which included participation by Dillingham, Rufus Choate, [[Abraham Lincoln]] and other prominent attorneys, Carpenter's legal theory was rejected in a similar case, so the Wisconsin case was withdrawn.<ref>Thompson, pp. 37-39.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Brown |first=William Fiske |date=1908 |title=Rock County, Wisconsin: A New History |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LUEVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=%22Gardner+vs.+Tisdale%22+titles#v=onepage&q=%22Gardner%20vs.%20Tisdale%22%20titles&f=false |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=C. F. Cooper & Co. |pages=157\u2013158}}</ref>\n\n==Barstow-Bashford election dispute==\nWisconsin's gubernatorial election of 1855 was thrown into doubt when incumbent Democratic governor [[William A. Barstow]] was ruled the 157-vote victor over Republican [[Coles Bashford]] by a board of canvassers friendly to Barstow. Discrepancies were discovered in the election returns and political tensions rose as both parties claimed the office and swore in their candidates. Hired by Barstow, Carpenter stalled by repeatedly postponing the case before the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court|state supreme court]]. He claimed that they held no [[jurisdiction]] because elections were matters of the [[Executive branch of the United States|executive branch]], which had ruled Barstow the winner. Nevertheless, the court did claim jurisdiction and the ability to examine election tallies (as Carpenter had previously argued for his own election for district attorney). Barstow then resigned, elevating Lieutenant Governor [[Arthur MacArthur, Sr.|Arthur MacArthur]] to the governorship. After the court ruled that Bashford was the rightful governor, MacArthur gave up the office. Barstow subsequently refused to pay Carpenter his fee.<ref>Thompson, pp. 40-45.</ref>\n\nDespite his defeat Carpenter had demonstrated his legal prowess to the state. A high volume of his cases required his presence in federal court in [[Milwaukee]], leading to him locating his practice there in 1858. He was also coaxed there by Democratic party boss Josiah Noonan, who arranged a law partnership between Carpenter and [[Edward George Ryan|Edward G. Ryan]], another highly regarded attorney and a force in the state Democratic Party. Despite their excellent credentials, they proved to be temperamentally incompatible, and ended their partnership the next year.<ref>Thompson, pp. 46-52.</ref>\n\nBy the time Carpenter moved to Milwaukee he had become adept in the area of railroad litigation and sued many railroads on behalf of investors left holding bonds made worthless by fraudulent manipulation. His debut before the U.S. Supreme Court resulted in his winning a judgment against the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company.<ref>Thompson, pp. 54-61.</ref> He was also successful as part of a team of lawyers defending abolitionist [[Sherman Booth]] from a charge of rape.<ref>Thompson, pp. 61-62.</ref>\n\n==Loyal Democrat during the Civil War==\nCarpenter supported Democrat Stephen Douglas in the 1860 presidential election, viewing Republican Abraham Lincoln as an honest but incompetent sectional candidate. Yet, he warned those in his party that he saw secession as treason, and he would be \"the first man to raise a musket\" in defense of the Constitution.<ref>Thompson, pp. 62-63.</ref> Following the Confederates' attack on Fort Sumter in 1861, Carpenter did not enlist but became a rousing speaker in support of the Union cause.<ref>Thompson, p. 65.</ref>\n\nWhile he saw that many federal actions would be unconstitutional in peacetime, he reasoned that arbitrary arrests and suspensions of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' were acts of self-preservation during wartime and thereby permitted.<ref>Thompson, pp. 64-65.</ref> He also became an early advocate for emancipation, but only as a war measure rather than an act of humanity.<ref>Thompson, p. 66.</ref> Excluded from meetings of the Democratic leadership, Carpenter joined other like-minded party members of the \"Loyal Democracy\" in considering a third party in Wisconsin, but nothing came of it.<ref>Thompson, pp. 72-78.</ref>\n\nPersonal letters he had written saying Lincoln was \"idiotic\" found their way into newspapers, but Carpenter supported him for re-election in 1864 by making numerous pro-Union and pro-Lincoln speeches.<ref>Thompson, pp. 79-82.</ref>\n\n==Defining the Reconstruction Acts==\nCarpenter was the key attorney in a series of landmark cases before the U.S. Supreme Court which helped define states' rights by determining the legality of the [[Reconstruction Acts|Reconstruction acts]] passed by Congress.\n\n''[[Ex parte Garland]]'' dealt with the disbarment from federal courts of Southern lawyers who refused to take an oath swearing they had not taken up arms or assisted the Confederacy. Carpenter argued that the act passed on January 24, 1865 was [[ex post facto]] (the war had since ended) and a [[bill of attainder]] (it punished without a trial). In December 1865 the court upheld his argument with the majority opinion employing phrases from Carpenter's brief.<ref>Thompson, pp. 89-90.</ref>\n\n''[[Ex parte McCardle]]'' concerned the legal authority of the occupying Union Army. Confederate Colonel William L. McCardle, the editor of the ''Vicksburg Times'', was charged with defying military authority by inciting rebellion, libeling federal officials, and intimidating voters. After the circuit court denied him a writ of [[habeas corpus]], McCardle appealed to the Supreme Court. Carpenter argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over a president's official acts, as in a similar case of his, ''Georgia vs. Grant''. Rather than claiming the Union's \"[[right of conquest]],\" Carpenter said the Southern states had surrendered their constitutional protections when they had seceded, essentially reverting to territories.<ref>Thompson, pp. 91-98.</ref>\n\nAfter he concluded his eloquent arguments, Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]] hugged him, declaring \"Carpenter, you have saved us!\" Even McCardle's attorney [[Jeremiah S. Black]] lauded him as \"the first Constitutional lawyer in the country.\" However, [[Radical Republicans]] in Congress feared that the reconstruction acts would be ruled unconstitutional, so they quickly pushed through a law repealing the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867, barring jurisdiction in pending cases and preventing a clear decision from being rendered by the court.<ref>Thompson, pp. 98-99.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Slaughterhouse cases]] Carpenter represented the Crescent City Livestock Landing and Slaughterhouse Company, which had been granted a monopoly on all slaughterhouse business in [[New Orleans]] by the [[carpetbagger|carpetbag]] state legislature of [[Louisiana]] in 1869. Butchers and cattle dealers thrown out of work by the law obtained an injunction from a district court, claiming they had been denied [[equal protection]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and deprived of property under the due process clause. Making a plea for states' rights, Carpenter contended that the amendment had been intended solely to elevate African Americans and had no bearing on economic statutes passed by a state. He also warned of too many powers being centralized in the federal government. The court concurred in Carpenter's narrowing of the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment.<ref>Thompson, pp. 100-102.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Bradwell vs. Illinois]]'', Carpenter sought to broaden the amendment's protections in the case of the editor of the [[Chicago]] ''Legal News'', [[Myra Bradwell]], who had been denied admission to the bar of the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] because she was a woman. Representing Bradwell, Carpenter argued that no class of people could be excluded from practicing the legal profession. The federal court disagreed, questioning the propriety of ruling on a state's qualifications for admission to the bar.<ref>Thompson, pp. 102-103.</ref>\n\nThese cases brought Carpenter handsome fees, national acclaim, and much derision from the losing factions. He'd also won the support of Stanton and President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who both urged him to run as a Republican for the U.S. Senate.<ref>Thompson, p. 99.</ref>\n\n==Republican senator==\nFollowing the Civil War Carpenter's transformation from a [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian Democrat]] into a Republican was complete. Despite reports that he backed [[President Andrew Johnson]]'s policies, he made speeches supporting the Radical congress. He called for the enfranchisement of African-American men and invited members of the Loyal Democracy to join the Republicans, as he himself did in the summer of 1867 with his support for Governor [[Lucius Fairchild]]'s re-election.\n\nWith high-profile backing Carpenter ran successfully for the senate seat occupied by [[James R. Doolittle]], a \"Johnsonized\" Republican who had fallen out of favor with his party.<ref>Thompson, pp. 105-117.</ref> With his victory he solidified his status with the \"Madison Regency,\" a Republican group that included former governor and Johnson's Postmaster General [[Alexander Randall]], Madison postmaster [[Elisha W. Keyes]] and ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'' editor and Republican state central committee chairman [[Horace Rublee]].<ref>Thompson, p. 112.</ref> After Rublee was appointed minister to [[Switzerland]] by President Grant, Keyes became party chairman and closely coordinated with Carpenter to distribute federal patronage jobs to political allies.\n\nOnce in the Senate, Carpenter moderated his views to the degree that he became one of the spokesmen of the emerging Stalwart Republicans. He opposed any \"fundamental conditions\" placed on states wishing to be readmitted to the Union, and favored blanket amnesty for former Confederates.<ref>Thompson, pp. 133-138.</ref> Carpenter was known as one of the staunchest supporters of the corrupt Grant administration.<ref>Thompson, pp. 148-149.</ref> In the Senate he presented an unabashed defense of political patronage, mocking the idea of civil service reform.<ref>Thompson, pp. 156-160.</ref> He also feuded with [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]] senators [[Charles Sumner]] and [[Carl Schurz]] over many issues. He delivered a sarcastic denunciation of Sumner's wide-reaching civil rights amendment to the Confederate amnesty bill.<ref>Thompson, pp. 160-164.</ref> As the chair of an investigating committee he also debunked Sumner and Schurz's claim that the War Department had broken its neutrality when it sold outmoded rifles to [[France]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]].<ref>Thompson, pp. 166-171.</ref> Despite such skirmishes Carpenter was a respected figure in the senate, being elected president pro tempore by his colleagues in 1871. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills ([[42nd United States Congress|42nd Congress]]) and the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expense (42nd and [[43rd United States Congress|43rd Congresses]]).\n\nAs part of another committee inquiry, Carpenter went to [[Louisiana]] to investigate election claims in order to determine the rightful governor of the contested state. His report was highly critical of both factions, but he urged the recognition of Republican governor [[William P. Kellogg]].<ref>Thompson, pp. 178-191.</ref> Years later Carpenter's impartiality was called into question when personal letters revealed a close relationship between the two, including a \"desperately short\" Carpenter asking Kellogg for a $1,000 loan.<ref>Thompson, pp. 222-223.</ref>\n\n==Drawing fire from press and party==\nAs Carpenter's influence grew within the Grant administration, so did the condemnations from the press. One of his Senate investigations resulted in two journalists being jailed for not divulging the source of a leaked treaty.<ref>Thompson, pp. 149-154.</ref> Opposition newspapers like the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' responded by not only criticizing Carpenter's methods, but by also condemning his moral character by bringing his private life into question.<ref>Thompson, pp. 200-202.</ref> Later in his term editors accused Carpenter of trying to effectively \"gag\" newspapers by advancing a bill that would allow judicial process to be served upon the agents (i.e. interviewers) of persons involved in civil suits.<ref>Thompson, pp. 215-216.</ref>\n\nIn 1873 Carpenter angered many in his own party by taking positions that ran counter to the stalwart doctrine. In a spirit of reform he boldly owned up to administration excesses such as the [[Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier of America scandal|Credit Mobilier]] and the \"Salary Grab,\" defending them in a speech in [[Janesville, Wisconsin|Janesville]].<ref>Thompson, pp. 193-198.</ref> In a speech at [[Ripon, Wisconsin|Ripon]] he denounced the railroads, insisting they were public highways paid for with government land grants. He also stated his belief that the government has a right as well as a duty to regulate corporations.<ref>Thompson, pp. 221-222.</ref>\n\nWishing to make the ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' into a more reliable organ for the state Republican party, Carpenter and other backers bought the paper and forced out editor [[Alexander M. Thomson]], who had been instrumental in getting Carpenter elected senator. Thomson was now deemed too critical of the party machine. His ousting made him a lifelong enemy of Carpenter. The ''Sentinel'' soon was seen as Carpenter's personal mouthpiece.<ref>Thompson, pp. 205-207</ref>\n\nDespite the incessant criticism, Carpenter was seen as being easily re-elected in 1875. Nevertheless, a surprise bolt by disgruntled Republicans combined with votes by calculating Democrats resulted in the election of [[Angus Cameron (American politician)|Angus Cameron]], a [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]] Republican.<ref>Thompson, pp. 218-230</ref>\n\n==Out of office and under scrutiny==\nIn 1875 Carpenter was implicated in the [[Whiskey Ring]] scandal that funneled federal liquor tax revenues to some states' Republican parties. Although he was close to key participants in the Milwaukee ring, no evidence emerged to prove his involvement.<ref>Thompson, pp. 233-242</ref>\n\nDuring this time he was also defending Grant's Secretary of War [[William W. Belknap]] against [[Trader post scandal|charges]] that he had accepted money in exchange for the appointment of a post trader. Despite Belknap's immediate resignation outraged House Democrats proceeded with his impeachment. Carpenter portrayed Belknap as the hapless victim of a social-climbing wife, but his legal victory relied on his assertion that jurisdiction over Belknap ended with his resignation.<ref>Thompson, pp. 243-246</ref>\n\nAlso in 1875 Carpenter was defense counsel for officials of the [[Miners\u2019 National Association]] (MNA) in an important labor case that sought to apply the legal concept of conspiracy to union picketing and organization efforts. The case grew out of a coal miners' strike in [[Clearfield County, Pennsylvania]] which was supported by the MNA, then numerically one of the largest American trade unions. First over fifty of the striking workers were tried upon a charge of criminal conspiracy and thirty-six of them were convicted with some sentenced to jail, although they appeared to have been guilty of no more than peaceful picketing. Then [[John Siney]], the president of the MNA, and Xingo Parks, one of the union\u2019s best organizers, were tried on the same charge. Siney was acquitted, but Parks convicted, although pardoned shortly thereafter<ref>Witte, Edwin E., Early American Labor Cases, 35 Yale Law Journal 7, 1926, pp. 830-31</ref>.\n\nFollowing the disputed presidential election of 1876, Carpenter was hired by supporters of the Democratic candidate [[Samuel J. Tilden]] to examine Louisiana's vote counts and argue for victory over Republican [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]. Carpenter's first-hand accounts of the corrupt Republican state administration gave the Democrats some reason for hope, but ultimately the partisan make-up of the special electoral commission (7 Republicans, 6 Democrats) and its refusal to look behind the certified counts made many of their rulings a forgone conclusive win for Hayes.<ref>Thompson, pp. 247-253</ref>\n\n==Return to the senate==\nDespite ongoing press criticism and declining health, in 1878 Carpenter launched a bid for the senate seat occupied by Republican [[Timothy Howe]]. With the help of a strong lobby, he won over enough votes in the legislature to prevail over state party boss (and former friend) Elisha W. Keyes.<ref>Thompson, pp. 254-264</ref>\n\nCarpenter's second term as senator lacked the political drama of his Reconstruction years. He spoke in favor of President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]]'s maintenance of federal troops at southern polling places. He also vigorously opposed the Democrats' proposed pardoning of General [[Fitz-John Porter]] for ignoring General [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]'s orders at [[Manassas]] in 1863, arguing that the power of pardon resides solely with the president.<ref>Thompson, pp. 264-266</ref> Carpenter remained a loyal supporter of President Grant in his quest for a third term, igniting bitter debates between Carpenter and White House aspirant Senator [[James G. Blaine]] of Maine.<ref>Thompson, pp. 268-270.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nWhile Carpenter's evident declining health was attributed to his indulgent lifestyle, he also suffered from the lung congestion of [[Bright's disease]]. After a cycle of relapses and recoveries he died on February 24, 1881 at his Washington, D.C. home surrounded by friends and family. He was buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.<ref>Thompson, pp. 275-280.</ref>\n\n==Family==\nIn 1855 Carpenter married Caroline Dillingham, the daughter of Paul Dillingham.<ref>{{cite book |last=Huse |first=Hiram A. |title=A Memorial Sketch of Paul Dillingham: Officers and Members: Report of Proceedings of the Annual Meeting |volume=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99o8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA77 |location=Montpelier, VT |publisher=Argus and Patriot Book and Job Printing |page=77|year=1892 }}</ref> They were the parents of four children.

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood|Phantom]] Blood how do i edit on wiki :(''\n*\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters.

Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

[[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] and his \"California Battalion\" used the mission as a base of operations during their war with [[Mexico]] in 1846 (see [[Bear Flag Revolt]]). The mission fell to ruins during the period of [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularization]] and the priests who were left would rent out rooms to help support the mission. The Mission San Lu\u00eds Obispo de Tolosa became the first [[courthouse]] and [[County jail|jail]] in [[San Luis Obispo County, California]]. In 1850, when California became a part of the United States, the first California bishop, Joseph Alemany, petitioned the Government to return some of the mission lands back to the Church.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://missionsanluisobispo.org/visit/#history|title=Visit|work=Mission San Luis Obispo de Toulosa|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}</ref> Since then, it has undergone major civic, political and structural changes, but real restoration did not begin until 1933.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://missionsanluisobispo.org/visit/#history|title=Visit|work=Mission San Luis Obispo de Toulosa|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}</ref> The mission is still the center of the busy downtown area, and functions as a [[Roman Catholic]] [[parish]] church for the City of San Luis Obispo in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey in California|Diocese of Monterey]]. In 1970 the Mission was recognized as the center of the City of [[San Luis Obispo]], with the dedication of Mission Plaza.<ref name=history/>\n\n==Spanish Origin==\nIn 1602, the Spanish began to show interest in California and sent [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno]], a pearl fisher, to explore the area. Vizcaino traveled the coast naming many of the cities that are important to the California coast today such as [[San Diego]], Santa Barbara and Monterey. Spain finally chose to create Vizcaino's suggested chain of missions when it was proven that California was indeed part of the continent. The goal of creating the chain was given to the [[Franciscan Order]]. While Spain had economic motives for establishing a stronghold in California, the [[Franciscan]] order of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Church also had religious motives.<ref name=TheTropics>{{cite web| url=http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/6788/missions.html| title= Mision San Carlos, Carmel| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027111530/http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/6788/missions.html | archive-date=27 October 2009| url-status=dead}}</ref>  With these factors in mind the missions were created in order to control the coast so that the ships from Spain would remain safe as well as bring the [[Natives]] to the Catholic faith. Re-education became the method for reaching Spain's religious and economic goals as they strived to convert the Native Americans to Catholicism as well as make them loyal Spanish subjects.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spanish missions in California]]\n* [[USNS Mission San Luis Obispo|''Mission San Luis Obispo'']] \u2013 a [[USNS Mission Buenaventura|''Mission Buenaventura'']] Class [[Oiler (ship)|fleet oiler]] built during World War II.\n* [[City of San Luis Obispo Historic Resources]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|author=Forbes, Alexander|year=1839|title=California: A History of Upper and Lower California|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_NH4FAAAAQAAJ|publisher=Smith, Elder and Co., Cornhill, London}}\n* {{cite book|author=Jones, Terry L. and Kathryn A.

The renovation was finally finished after completion of the [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] in 1819, and celebrated a year later by the arrival of two mission bells from [[Lima, Peru]].<ref name=\"SanLuis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.californiamissions.com/cahistory/sanluis.html|title=Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121034159/http://www.californiamissions.com/cahistory/sanluis.html|archive-date=21 January 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The arrival of the bells marked the end of improvements made to Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa for many years.<ref name=\"history\" /> In 1830 Father Luis Gil y Taboada took over the mission, but he died three years later. Then in 1842, the death of Father Ramon Abella marked the last [[Franciscan]] at the mission.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nIn 1845, Governor [[P\u00edo Pico]] declared the mission buildings for sale and he sold everything except the church for a total of $510. [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] and his \"California Battalion\" used the mission as a base of operations during their war with [[Mexico]] in 1846 (see [[Bear Flag Revolt]]). The mission fell to ruins during the period of [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularization]] and the priests who were left would rent out rooms to help support the mission. The Mission San Lu\u00eds Obispo de Tolosa became the first [[courthouse]] and [[County jail|jail]] in [[San Luis Obispo County, California]]. In 1850, when California became a part of the United States, the first California bishop, Joseph Alemany, petitioned the Government to return some of the mission lands back to the Church<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://missionsanluisobispo.org/visit/#history|title=Visit|work=Mission San Luis Obispo de Toulosa|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}</ref>. Since then, it has undergone major civic, political and structural changes, but real restoration did not begin until 1933<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://missionsanluisobispo.org/visit/#history|title=Visit|work=Mission San Luis Obispo de Toulosa|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}</ref>. The mission is still the center of the busy downtown area, and functions as a [[Roman Catholic]] [[parish]] church for the City of San Luis Obispo in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey in California|Diocese of Monterey]]. In 1970 the Mission was recognized as the center of the City of [[San Luis Obispo]], with the dedication of Mission Plaza.<ref name=history/>\n\n==Spanish Origin==\nIn 1602, the Spanish began to show interest in California and sent [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno]], a pearl fisher, to explore the area. Vizcaino traveled the coast naming many of the cities that are important to the California coast today such as [[San Diego]], Santa Barbara and Monterey. Spain finally chose to create Vizcaino's suggested chain of missions when it was proven that California was indeed part of the continent. The goal of creating the chain was given to the [[Franciscan Order]]. While Spain had economic motives for establishing a stronghold in California, the [[Franciscan]] order of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Church also had religious motives.<ref name=TheTropics>{{cite web| url=http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/6788/missions.html| title= Mision San Carlos, Carmel| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027111530/http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/6788/missions.html | archive-date=27 October 2009| url-status=dead}}</ref>  With these factors in mind the missions were created in order to control the coast so that the ships from Spain would remain safe as well as bring the [[Natives]] to the Catholic faith. Re-education became the method for reaching Spain's religious and economic goals as they strived to convert the Native Americans to Catholicism as well as make them loyal Spanish subjects.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spanish missions in California]]\n* [[USNS Mission San Luis Obispo|''Mission San Luis Obispo'']] \u2013 a [[USNS Mission Buenaventura|''Mission Buenaventura'']] Class [[Oiler (ship)|fleet oiler]] built during World War II.\n* [[City of San Luis Obispo Historic Resources]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|author=Forbes, Alexander|year=1839|title=California: A History of Upper and Lower California|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_NH4FAAAAQAAJ|publisher=Smith, Elder and Co., Cornhill, London}}\n* {{cite book|author=Jones, Terry L. and Kathryn A.
