Her professional career ran from 1850 to 1888 under the last name '''Isma\u00ebl''', which was her husband [[Jean-Vital Jammes]]' stage name, and she would keep the stage name even after their divorce in 1860.

Due to their professional careers, Alceste was born in [[Amsterdam]], The Netherlands.\n\nAround 1850, Paul-Joseph joined the [[Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon]], where his daughter also became a boarder. There, she met the [[baritone]] Isma\u00ebl, who joined Lyon in the summer of 1851, and on 24 January 1852, she married him in the Guilloti\u00e8re neighborhood of Lyon.

However, from 1854 on, their marriage was troubled, and C\u0153uriot asked for and obtained a separation in 1860 at the expense of Isma\u00ebl.

The divorce was enforced by default in [[Marseille]] on 30 March 1885. During the 1885-1886 season, C\u0153uriot performed at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole]] in [[Toulouse]], where she found she would be working alongside Isma\u00ebl's second wife, [[Marie Isma\u00ebl-Garcin]].

Though poorly documented, it seems that Vendramins words regarding the letters entrusted to Bruti suggest that the Emperor did not give Bruti a chance to reach an agreement.
