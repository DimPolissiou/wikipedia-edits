[[Sire Records]] released it as the album's third single on September 7, 1983. \"Holiday\" later appeared remixed on the remix compilation ''[[You Can Dance]]'' (1987) and the greatest hits compilation ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]'' (1990), and in its original form on the greatest hits album ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]'' (2009).\n\nWritten by Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens of [[Pure Energy (band)|Pure Energy]], the track was offered to Madonna by her producer [[John \"Jellybean\" Benitez]] when she was looking for a potential hit track to include on her debut album. After accepting the song, she and Benitez worked on it and altered its composition by the addition of a piano solo performed by their friend, [[Fred Zarr]].\n\n\"Holiday\" features instrumentation from guitars, electronic handclaps, a cowbell, and a synthesized string arrangement, while its lyrics speak about the universal sentiment of taking a holiday. Universally acclaimed by [[Music journalism|critics]], the song became Madonna's first mainstream [[hit single]] in the United States, peaking at number 16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It also became her first top-ten single in several countries, including Australia, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Madonna has performed \"Holiday\" on most of her tours and it is generally included as a part of the encore. Different performances of the song are included in the recorded releases of her tours. \"Holiday\" has been covered by several artists and appeared in multiple television shows. In 2003, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]'' ranked \"Holiday\" at number 88 in their list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzieklijstjes.nl/Q1001bestsongsever.htm|title=Q - 1001 best songs ever (2003)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Background and writing==\nIn 1983, 25-year-old Madonna was recording her eponymous debut album with [[Warner Bros. Records]] producer [[Reggie Lucas]], after [[Sire Records]] green-lit it when her first single \"[[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]]\" became a club hit.<ref>{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=9}}</ref> However, she did not have enough material for the album.<ref name=\"rikky1\">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=10}}</ref> Lucas brought two new songs to the project and [[John \"Jellybean\" Benitez]], a DJ at Funhouse disco was called to remix the available tracks. In the meantime due to a conflict of interest, Madonna's collaborator on \"Everybody\", [[Stephen Bray]] had sold a song \"Ain't No Big Deal\" to an act called Barracuda on another label, rendering it unavailable for Madonna's album.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> It was Benitez who discovered a new song written by Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens of the pop group [[Pure Energy (band)|Pure Energy]].<ref name=\"cross1\">{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=26}}</ref> The song, titled \"Holiday\", had been turned down by singers [[Phyllis Hyman]] and [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], formerly of [[The Supremes]].<ref name=\"morton1\">{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=158}}</ref> Hudson and Stevens were asked by Benitez if they had any song for then-unknown Madonna and since their record label [[Prism Records|Prism]] did not want to release \"Holiday\", they gave it to Benitez. Pure Energy recalled in an interview with [[Blogcritics]]:\n<blockquote>\nWe knew that the song had that magic to it. Since we weren't going to be able to record [\"Holiday\"] ourselves, we were really hoping it would fall into the hands of someone who was going to do it justice. Jellybean was shopping it, and I think he pitched it to Phyllis Hyman and a couple of other artists. We didn't pitch the songs that much. I was still hoping we could come around to Pure Energy recording it.<ref name=\"blog\"/>\n</blockquote>\nStevens remembered that she had started playing the beginning chords of \"Holiday\" on a keyboard but could not progress further. Hudson, who felt that the music could lead to something constructive, urged Stevens to experiment with it for a week and ultimately came up with the hook \"Holiday, Celebrate!\", while going back-and-forth between them. Inspired by the opening chords and hearing depressing news on the radio, Hudson started penning down the song and within 30 minutes was able to complete it, with the whole composition and arrangement in his mind. Most of the song was written by him with Stevens suggesting few alterations like the line \"It would be so nice\".<ref name=\"blog\">{{cite web|url=https://blogcritics.org/interview-curtis-hudson-lisa-stevens-songwriters/|title=Interview: Curtis Hudson & Lisa Stevens, Songwriters of Madonna's 'Holiday'|last=Kantor|first=Justin|date=February 1, 2012|accessdate=May 19, 2018|publisher=[[Blogcritics]]}}</ref>\n\n==Recording and composition==\nBenitez and Madonna sent the [[demo (music)|demo]] to their friend, [[Fred Zarr]] so he could change the arrangement and program it differently. After the vocals were added by Madonna, Benitez spent four days and tried to enhance the commercial appeal of the track before the April 1983 deadline set by Madonna's record label.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/><ref name=\"morton1\"/> Benitez had not [[record producer|produced]] any song at that time but was aware of how to reconstruct the different musical pieces in a studio. He composed the sound, assembled the musicians and hummed the tune to them for recording. He also asked Madonna to sing in a \"soulful\" manner on the track.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|p=109}}</ref> Just before it was completed, Madonna and Benitez met Zarr at [[Sigma Sound Studios]] in Manhattan where the track was recorded. The singer suggested Zarr to add a piano solo towards the end of the track, as well as asked Hudson to change a part of the funk in the guitar rhythm.<ref name=\"cross1\"/>\n\n{{listen\n | filename     = Madonna-holiday.ogg\n | title        = \"Holiday\"\n | pos          = left\n | description  = A sample of \"Holiday\" featuring its repetitive [[refrain|chorus]] and the four bar sequence in its musical composition\n}}\nPure Energy, who were also present at the recording studio during February 1983,<ref name=\"liner\"/> recalled that the rhythm track was finished in a single day because they did not want to venture further from the demo track. Minor changes were included, like substituting Hudson's [[LinnDrum]] with Zarr's [[Oberheim DMX]]. Other changes were in the vocal delivery from the soul, gospel like singing on the demo to Madonna's \"poppier\" belting; she still remained true to the original melody of the track. The group was not given a production credit on \"Holiday\" since Benitez had presented the track to Sire Records, and he had an existing relationship with Madonna. Although Hudson pressed for a credit, they ultimately let it go since they felt that the song would be their chance to get recognized as efficient songwriters.<ref name=\"blog\"/>\n\nMusically, \"Holiday\" is a [[dance-pop]] and [[post-disco]] song devoid of any particular structure.<ref name=\"Sullivan2013\">{{cite book|first=Steve|last=Sullivan|title=Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings|year=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8296-6|pages=336}}</ref> It begins with a chord sequence reminiscent of [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" (1984).<ref name=\"rikky2\"/> Set in the [[time signature]] of common time with a medium [[tempo]] of 116 [[beats per minute]], the song is composed in the key of [[D major]] and is six minutes seven seconds in length. Madonna's vocal range spans from B<sub>3</sub> to C{{music|sharp}}<sub>5</sub>. The track follows in the [[chord progression]] of G\u2013A\u2013Bm in the first line, when Madonna sings \"Holiday!\" and changes to G\u2013A\u2013F{{music|sharp}}m\u2013G in the second line, when Madonna sings \"Celebrate!\".<ref name=\"sheet\">{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0037594|title=Madonna 'Holiday' Sheet Music|publisher=Musicnotes.com.

Towards the end of the song, a change in the arrangement happens, where a piano [[Break (music)|break]] is heard.

[[Sire Records]] released it as the album's third single on September 7, 1983. \"Holiday\" later appeared remixed on the remix compilation ''[[You Can Dance]]'' (1987) and the greatest hits compilation ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]'' (1990), and in its original form on the greatest hits album ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]'' (2009).\n\nWritten by Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens of [[Pure Energy (band)|Pure Energy]], the track was offered to Madonna by her producer [[John \"Jellybean\" Benitez]] when she was looking for a potential hit track to include on her debut album. After accepting the song, she and Benitez worked on it and altered its composition by the addition of a piano solo performed by their friend, [[Fred Zarr]].\n\n\"Holiday\" features instrumentation from guitars, electronic handclaps, a cowbell, and a synthesized string arrangement, while its lyrics speak about the universal sentiment of taking a holiday. Universally acclaimed by [[Music journalism|critics]], the song became Madonna's first mainstream [[hit single]] in the United States, peaking at number 16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It also became her first top-ten single in several countries, including Australia, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Madonna has performed \"Holiday\" on most of her tours and it is generally included as a part of the encore. Different performances of the song are included in the recorded releases of her tours. \"Holiday\" has been covered by several artists and appeared in multiple television shows. In 2003, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]'' ranked \"Holiday\" at number 88 in their list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzieklijstjes.nl/Q1001bestsongsever.htm|title=Q - 1001 best songs ever (2003)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Background and writing==\nIn 1983, 25-year-old Madonna was recording her eponymous debut album with [[Warner Bros. Records]] producer [[Reggie Lucas]], after [[Sire Records]] green-lit it when her first single \"[[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]]\" became a club hit.<ref>{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=9}}</ref> However, she did not have enough material for the album.<ref name=\"rikky1\">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=10}}</ref> Lucas brought two new songs to the project and [[John \"Jellybean\" Benitez]], a DJ at Funhouse disco was called to remix the available tracks. In the meantime due to a conflict of interest, Madonna's collaborator on \"Everybody\", [[Stephen Bray]] had sold a song \"Ain't No Big Deal\" to an act called Barracuda on another label, rendering it unavailable for Madonna's album.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> It was Benitez who discovered a new song written by Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens of the pop group [[Pure Energy (band)|Pure Energy]].<ref name=\"cross1\">{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=26}}</ref> The song, titled \"Holiday\", had been turned down by singers [[Phyllis Hyman]] and [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], formerly of [[The Supremes]].<ref name=\"morton1\">{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=158}}</ref> Hudson and Stevens were asked by Benitez if they had any song for then-unknown Madonna and since their record label [[Prism Records|Prism]] did not want to release \"Holiday\", they gave it to Benitez. Pure Energy recalled in an interview with [[Blogcritics]]:\n<blockquote>\nWe knew that the song had that magic to it. Since we weren't going to be able to record [\"Holiday\"] ourselves, we were really hoping it would fall into the hands of someone who was going to do it justice. Jellybean was shopping it, and I think he pitched it to Phyllis Hyman and a couple of other artists. We didn't pitch the songs that much. I was still hoping we could come around to Pure Energy recording it.<ref name=\"blog\"/>\n</blockquote>\nStevens remembered that she had started playing the beginning chords of \"Holiday\" on a keyboard but could not progress further. Hudson, who felt that the music could lead to something constructive, urged Stevens to experiment with it for a week and ultimately came up with the hook \"Holiday, Celebrate!\", while going back-and-forth between them. Inspired by the opening chords and hearing depressing news on the radio, Hudson started penning down the song and within 30 minutes was able to complete it, with the whole composition and arrangement in his mind. Most of the song was written by him with Stevens suggesting few alterations like the line \"It would be so nice\".<ref name=\"blog\">{{cite web|url=https://blogcritics.org/interview-curtis-hudson-lisa-stevens-songwriters/|title=Interview: Curtis Hudson & Lisa Stevens, Songwriters of Madonna's 'Holiday'|last=Kantor|first=Justin|date=February 1, 2012|accessdate=May 19, 2018|publisher=[[Blogcritics]]}}</ref>\n\n==Recording and composition==\nBenitez and Madonna sent the [[demo (music)|demo]] to their friend, [[Fred Zarr]] so he could change the arrangement and program it differently. After the vocals were added by Madonna, Benitez spent four days and tried to enhance the commercial appeal of the track before the April 1983 deadline set by Madonna's record label.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/><ref name=\"morton1\"/> Benitez had not [[record producer|produced]] any song at that time but was aware of how to reconstruct the different musical pieces in a studio. He composed the sound, assembled the musicians and hummed the tune to them for recording. He also asked Madonna to sing in a \"soulful\" manner on the track.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|p=109}}</ref> Just before it was completed, Madonna and Benitez met Zarr at [[Sigma Sound Studios]] in Manhattan where the track was recorded. The singer suggested Zarr to add a piano solo towards the end of the track, as well as asked Hudson to change a part of the funk in the guitar rhythm.<ref name=\"cross1\"/>\n\n{{listen\n | filename     = Madonna-holiday.ogg\n | title        = \"Holiday\"\n | pos          = left\n | description  = A sample of \"Holiday\" featuring its repetitive [[refrain|chorus]] and the four bar sequence in its musical composition\n}}\nPure Energy, who were also present at the recording studio during February 1983,<ref name=\"liner\"/> recalled that the rhythm track was finished in a single day because they did not want to venture further from the demo track. Minor changes were included, like substituting Hudson's [[LinnDrum]] with Zarr's [[Oberheim DMX]]. Other changes were in the vocal delivery from the soul, gospel like singing on the demo to Madonna's \"poppier\" belting; she still remained true to the original melody of the track. The group was not given a production credit on \"Holiday\" since Benitez had presented the track to Sire Records, and he had an existing relationship with Madonna. Although Hudson pressed for a credit, they ultimately let it go since they felt that the song would be their chance to get recognized as efficient songwriters.<ref name=\"blog\"/>\n\nMusically, \"Holiday\" is a [[dance-pop]] and [[post-disco]] song devoid of any particular structure.<ref name=\"Sullivan2013\">{{cite book|first=Steve|last=Sullivan|title=Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings|year=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8296-6|pages=336}}</ref> It begins with a chord sequence reminiscent of [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" (1984).<ref name=\"rikky2\"/> Set in the [[time signature]] of common time with a medium [[tempo]] of 116 [[beats per minute]], the song is composed in the key of [[D major]] and is six minutes seven seconds in length. Madonna's vocal range spans from B<sub>3</sub> to C{{music|sharp}}<sub>5</sub>. The track follows in the [[chord progression]] of G\u2013A\u2013Bm in the first line, when Madonna sings \"Holiday!\" and changes to G\u2013A\u2013F{{music|sharp}}m\u2013G in the second line, when Madonna sings \"Celebrate!\".<ref name=\"sheet\">{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0037594|title=Madonna 'Holiday' Sheet Music|publisher=Musicnotes.com.

Towards the end of the song, a change in the arrangement happens, where a piano [[Break (music)|break]] is heard. Lyrically the song expresses the universal sentiment that everybody needs a holiday from their daily lives.<ref name=\"rikky2\"/> Along with Benitez's production and Zarr's instrumentation, other personnel working on \"Holiday\" included Raymond Hudson on [[bass (sound)|bass]], Bashiri Johnson on [[percussion instrument|percussion]] and Tina B. and Norma Jean Wright who provided background vocals.<ref name=\"liner\">{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Madonna (Madonna album)|Madonna]]|others=[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]|year=1983|type=LP, Vinyl, CD|publisher=[[Sire Records]]|id=9 23867-1}}</ref>\n\n==Release details==\nInitially it was decided that \"[[Lucky Star (Madonna song)|Lucky Star]]\" would be released as a single; instead \"Holiday\" was released in the United States when the latter was picked up by radios for airplay and became a dance hit.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> Warner Bros.

Typical areas of study include:<ref name=McKinney>{{cite book \n|title= The Diagnosis and Correction of Vocal Faults\n|last= McKinney\n|first= James\n|year= 1994\n|publisher= Genovex Music Group\n|isbn= 978-1-56593-940-0}}</ref>\n:\n* [[Human anatomy]] and [[Human physiology|physiology]] as it relates to the physical process of singing.\n* Breathing and air support for singing\n* [[Human position|Posture]] for singing\n* [[Phonation]]\n* [[Vocal resonation]] or [[voice projection]]\n* Diction, vowels and articulation\n* [[Vocal registration]]\n* [[Sostenuto]] and [[legato]] for singing\n* Other singing elements, such as range extension, tone quality, [[vibrato]], [[coloratura]]\n* Vocal health and [[voice disorders]] related to singing\n* Vocal styles, such as learning to sing [[opera]], [[belt (music)|belt]], or [[Art song]]\n* [[Phonetics]]\n* [[Voice classification]]\n\nAll of these different concepts are a part of developing proper '''vocal technique'''. Not all [[voice teacher]]s have the same opinions within every topic of study which causes variations in pedagogical approaches and vocal technique.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sanzio 01 Pythagoras.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pythagoras]], the man in the center with the book, teaching music, in [[The School of Athens]] by [[Raphael]]]]\nWithin Western culture, the study of vocal pedagogy began in [[Ancient Greece]]. Scholars such as [[Alypius (music writer)|Alypius]] and [[Pythagoras]] studied and made observations on the art of singing. It is unclear, however, whether the Greeks ever developed a systematic approach to teaching singing as little writing on the subject survives today.<ref name=\"groveONE\">''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians]]''. Edited by [[Stanley Sadie]], ''Volume 6. Edmund to Fryklund''. {{ISBN|1-56159-174-2}}, Copyright Macmillan 1980.</ref>\n\nThe first surviving record of a systematized approach to teaching singing was developed in the [[medieval]] [[monasteries]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] sometime near the beginning of the 13th century. As with other fields of study, the monasteries were the center of musical intellectual life during the medieval period and many men within the monasteries devoted their time to the study of music and the art of singing. Highly influential in the development of a vocal pedagogical system were monks [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] and [[Jerome of Moravia]] who were the first to develop a concept of [[vocal registers]]. These men identified three registers: [[chest voice]], [[throat voice]], and [[head voice]] (pectoris, guttoris, and capitis). Their concept of head voice, however, is much more similar to the modern pedagogists understanding of the [[falsetto register]]. Other concepts discussed in the monastic system included [[vocal resonance]], [[voice classification]], breath support, diction, and tone quality to name a few. The ideas developed within the monastic system highly influenced the development of vocal pedagogy over the next several centuries including the [[Bel canto|Bel Canto]] style of singing.<ref name=\"groveONE\"/>\n\nWith the onset of the [[Renaissance]] in the 15th century, the study of singing began to move outside of the church. The courts of rich patrons, such as the Dukes of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] who supported the [[Burgundian School]] and the [[Franco-Flemish School]], became secular centers of study for singing and all other areas of musical study. The vocal pedagogical methods taught in these schools, however, were based on the concepts developed within the monastic system. Many of the teachers within these schools had their initial musical training from singing in church choirs as children. The church also remained at the forefront of musical composition at this time and remained highly influential in shaping musical tastes and practices both in and outside the church. It was the Catholic Church that first popularized the use of [[castrato]] singers in the 16th century, which ultimately led to the popularity of castrato voices in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] [[operas]].<ref name=\"Stark\"/>\n\nIt was not until the development of opera in the 17th century that vocal pedagogy began to break away from some of the established thinking of the monastic writers and develop deeper understandings of the physical process of singing and its relation to key concepts like [[vocal registration]] and [[vocal resonation]]. It was also during this time, that noted [[voice teacher]]s began to emerge. [[Giulio Caccini]] is an example of an important early Italian voice teacher.<ref name=\"groveONE\"/> In the late 17th century, the [[bel canto]] method of singing began to develop in Italy. This style of singing had a huge impact on the development of opera and the development of vocal pedagogy during the [[Classical music era|Classical]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] periods. It was during this time, that teachers and composers first began to identify singers by and write roles for more specific [[voice types]]. However, it wasn't until the 19th century that more clearly defined voice classification systems like the German [[Fach]] system emerged. Within these systems, more descriptive terms were used in classifying voices such as [[coloratura soprano]] and [[lyric soprano]].<ref name=Stark/>\n\n[[File:Garcia-Laryngoskop.gif|thumb|left|175px|Examining the vocal mechanism with a [[laryngoscope]], late 19th century]]\nVoice teachers in the 19th century continued to train singers for careers in opera.  [[Manuel Patricio Rodr\u00edguez Garc\u00eda]] is often considered one of the most important voice teachers of the 19th century, and is credited with the development of the [[laryngoscope]] and the beginning of modern voice pedagogy.\n[[File:Matilde Marchesi.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Mathilde Marchesi]] was both an important singer and teacher of singing at the turn of the 20th century.]]\nThe field of voice pedagogy became more fully developed in the middle of the 20th century.  A few American voice teachers began to study the science, anatomy, and physiology of singing, especially [[Ralph Appelman]] at [[Indiana University]], [[Oren Brown]] at the [[Washington University School of Medicine]] and later the [[Juilliard School]], and [[William Vennard]] at the [[University of Southern California]].  This shift in approach to the study of singing led to the rejection of many of the assertions of the [[bel canto]] singing method, most particularly in the areas of [[vocal registration]] and [[vocal resonation]].<ref name=Gurnee>{{cite book \n|title= In Memoriam: William D. Vennard\n|last= Gurnee\n|first=  Robert T. \n|year= 1986\n|publisher= [[The NATS Bulletin]]\n}}</ref> As a result, there are currently two predominating schools of thought among voice teachers today, those who maintain the historical positions of the [[bel canto]] method and those who choose to embrace more contemporary understandings based in current knowledge of human anatomy and physiology. There are also those teachers who borrow ideas from both perspectives, creating a hybrid of the two.<ref name=\"Vennard\">\n{{cite book \n |title= Singing: the mechanism and the technic\n |last= Vennard\n |first= William\n |year= 1967\n |publisher=[[Carl Fischer Music]]\n |isbn=978-0-8258-0055-9\n}}</ref><ref name=Appelman/>\n\nAppelman and Vennard were also part of a group of voice instructors who developed courses of study for beginning voice teachers, adding these scientific ideas to the standard exercises and empirical ways to improve vocal technique, and by 1980 the subject of voice pedagogy was beginning to be included in many college music degree programs for singers and vocal music educators.<ref name=Gurnee/>\n\nMore recent works by authors such as [[Richard Miller (singer)|Richard Miller]] and Johan Sundberg have increased the general knowledge of voice teachers, and scientific and practical aspects of voice pedagogy continue to be studied and discussed by professionals.  In addition, the creation of organisations such as the [[National Association of Teachers of Singing]] (now an international organization of Vocal Instructors) has enabled voice teachers to establish more of a consensus about their work, and has expanded the understanding of what singing teachers do.<ref name=McKinney/><ref name = \"Miller\">{{cite book\n  | last = Miller\n  | first = Richard\n  | authorlink = Richard Miller (singer)\n  | title = The Structure of Singing\n  | publisher = [[Schirmer Books]]\n  | year = 1986\n  | isbn = 0-02-872660-X\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/structureofsingi0000mill\n  }}</ref>\n\n==Topics of study==\n\n===Pedagogical philosophy===\nThere are basically three major approaches to vocal pedagogy, all related to how the  mechanistic and psychological controls are employed within the act of singing. Some voice instructors advocate an extreme mechanistic approach that believes that singing is largely a matter of getting the right physical parts in the right places at the right time, and that correcting vocal faults is accomplished by calling direct attention to the parts which are not working well. On the other extreme, is the school of thought that believes that attention should never be directed to any part of the vocal mechanism\u2014that singing is a matter of producing the right mental images of the desired tone, and that correcting vocal faults is achieved by learning to think the right thoughts and by releasing the emotions through interpretation of the music. Most voice teachers, however, believe that the truth lies somewhere in between the two extremes and adopt a composite of those two approaches.<ref name=\"Greene\">\n{{cite book \n |title= The voice and its disorders \n |author= Greene Margaret, Mathieson Lesley \n |year= 2001\n |publisher= John Wiley & Sons \n |edition=6th\n |isbn=1-86156-196-2\n}}</ref>\n\n===The nature of vocal sounds===\n\n====Physiology of vocal sound production====\n[[File:Illu bronchi lungs.jpg|350px|right]]\nThere are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: [[Breathing|respiration]], [[phonation]], [[vocal resonation|resonation]], and [[Place of articulation|articulation]]. These processes occur in the following sequence: \n#Breath is taken\n#Sound is initiated in the [[larynx]]\n#The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it\n#The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units\nAlthough these four processes are to be considered separately, in actual practice they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.<ref name=\"Appelman\"/>\n\n=====Respiration=====\n[[File:Gray1204.png|right|300px|thumb|A labeled anatomical diagram of the [[vocal folds]] or cords.]]\nIn its most basic sense, respiration is the process of moving air in and out of the body\u2014inhalation and exhalation. Sound is produced in the Larynx. But producing the sound would not be possible without a power source: the flow of air from the lungs. This flow sets the vocal folds into motion to produce sound.<ref>'Anatomy of the Voice' by Theodore Dimon, Illustration by G. David Brown. {{ISBN|978-1-62317-197-1}} </ref>  Breathing for singing and speaking is a more controlled process than is the ordinary breathing used for sustaining life. The controls applied to exhalation are particularly important in good vocal technique.<ref name=\"Appelman\"/>\n\n=====Phonation=====\n[[Phonation]] is the process of producing vocal sound by the vibration of the [[vocal folds]] that is in turn modified by the resonance of the [[vocal tract]].<ref>Titze, I. R. (2008). The human instrument. Sci.Am. 298 (1):94\u2013101. PM 18225701</ref><ref>Titze, I.R. (1994). Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall (currently published by NCVS.org), {{ISBN|978-0-13-717893-3}}.</ref> It takes place in the [[larynx]] when the [[vocal folds]] are brought together and breath pressure is applied to them in such a way that vibration ensues causing an audible source of acoustic energy, i.e., sound, which can then be modified by the articulatory actions of the rest of the [[vocal apparatus]]. The vocal folds are brought together primarily by the action of the interarytenoid muscles, which pull the [[arytenoid cartilages]] together.<ref name=McKinney/>\n\n=====Resonation=====\n{{main|Vocal resonation}}\n[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.<ref name=\"McKinney\" />\n\nThere are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the [[human chest|chest]], the [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal tree]], the [[larynx]] itself, the [[human pharynx|pharynx]], the [[human oral cavity|oral cavity]], the [[nasal cavity]], and the [[sinuses]].<ref name=\"Greene\"/>\n\nResearch has shown that the larynx, the pharynx and the oral cavity are the main resonators of vocal sound, with the nasal cavity only coming into play in nasal consonants, or nasal vowels, such as those found in French. This main resonating space, from above the vocal folds to the lips is known as the [[vocal tract]]. Many voice users experience sensations in the sinuses that may be misconstrued as resonance. However, these sensations are caused by sympathetic vibrations, and are a result, rather than a cause, of efficient vocal resonance.<ref name = \"Miller\"/>\n\n=====Articulation=====\n{{main|Place of articulation}}\n[[File:Places of articulation.svg|thumb|200px|Places of articulation (passive & active):<br />1. Exo-labial, 2. Endo-labial, 3. Dental, 4. Alveolar, 5. Post-alveolar, 6. Pre-palatal, 7. Palatal, 8. Velar, 9. Uvular, 10. Pharyngeal, 11. Glottal, 12. Epiglottal, 13. Radical, 14. Postero-dorsal, 15. Antero-dorsal, 16. Laminal, 17. Apical, 18. Sub-apical]]\nArticulation is the process by which the joint product of the vibrator and the resonators is shaped into recognizable speech sounds through the muscular adjustments and movements of the speech organs. These adjustments and movements of the articulators result in verbal communication and thus form the essential difference between the human voice and other musical instruments. Singing without understandable words limits the voice to nonverbal communication.<ref name=\"Greene\"/> In relation to the physical process of singing, vocal instructors tend to focus more on active articulation as opposed to passive articulation. There are five basic active articulators: the lip (\"[[labial consonant]]s\"), the flexible front of the tongue (\"[[coronal consonant]]s\"), the middle/back of the tongue (\"[[dorsal consonant]]s\"), the root of the tongue together with the [[epiglottis]] (\"[[pharyngeal consonant]]s\"), and the [[glottis]] (\"[[glottal consonant]]s\"). These articulators can act independently of each other, and two or more may work together in what is called ''coarticulation''.\n\nUnlike active articulation, passive articulation is a continuum without many clear-cut boundaries. The places linguolabial and interdental, interdental and dental, dental and alveolar, alveolar and palatal, palatal and velar, velar and uvular merge into one another, and a consonant may be pronounced somewhere between the named places.\n\nIn addition, when the front of the tongue is used, it may be the upper surface or ''blade'' of the tongue that makes contact (\"[[laminal consonant]]s\"), the tip of the tongue (\"[[apical consonant]]s\"), or the under surface (\"[[sub-apical consonant]]s\"). These articulations also merge into one another without clear boundaries.\n\n=====Interpretation=====\nInterpretation is sometimes listed by voice teachers as a fifth physical process even though strictly speaking it is not a physical process. The reason for this is that interpretation does influence the kind of sound a singer makes which is ultimately achieved through a physical action the singer is doing. Although teachers may acquaint their students with musical styles and performance practices and suggest certain interpretive effects, most voice teachers agree that interpretation can not be taught. Students who lack a natural creative imagination and aesthetic sensibility can not learn it from someone else. Failure to interpret well is not a vocal fault, even though it may affect vocal sound significantly.<ref name=\"McKinney\"/>\n\n====Classification of vocal sounds====\nVocal sounds are divided into two basic categories-[[vowels]] and [[consonants]]-with a wide variety of sub-classifications. Voice Teachers and serious voice students spend a great deal of time studying how the voice forms vowels and consonants, and studying the problems that certain consonants or vowels may cause while singing. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is used frequently by voice teachers and their students.<ref name=\"Greene\"/>\n\n====Problems in describing vocal sounds====\nDescribing vocal sound is an inexact science largely because the [[human voice]] is a self-contained instrument. Since the vocal instrument is internal, the singer's ability to monitor the sound produced is complicated by the vibrations carried to the ear through the Eustachean (auditory) tube and the bony structures of the head and neck. In other words, most singers hear something different in their ears/head than what a person listening to them hears. As a result, voice teachers often focus less on how it \"sounds\" and more on how it \"feels\". Vibratory sensations resulting from the closely related processes of phonation and resonation, and kinesthetic ones arising from muscle tension, movement, body position, and weight serve as a guide to the singer on correct vocal production.\n\nAnother problem in describing vocal sound lies in the vocal vocabulary itself. There are many schools of thought within vocal pedagogy and different schools have adopted different terms, sometimes from other artistic disciplines. This has led to the use of a plethora of descriptive terms applied to the voice which are not always understood to mean the same thing. Some terms sometimes used to describe a quality of a voice's sound are: warm, white, dark, light, round, reedy, spread, focused, covered, swallowed, forward, ringing, hooty, bleaty, plummy, mellow, pear-shaped, and so forth.<ref name=\"Appelman\"/>\n\n===Body alignment===\nThe singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body exist. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the body alignment of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the [[diaphragmatic breathing|diaphragm]]. Good body alignment allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good body alignment also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Voice Instructors have also noted that when singers assume good body alignment it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good body alignment. Habitual good body alignment also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.<ref name=\"Vennard\"/>\n\n===Breathing and breath support===\nIn the words of Robert C. White, who paraphrased a \"Credo\" for singing:\n<blockquote>\nIn the Beginning there was Breath, and Singing was with Breath, and Singing was Breath, and Singing ''was'' Breath. And all singing was made by the Breath, and without Breath was not any Singing made that was made. (White 1988, p. 26)\n</blockquote>\n\nAll singing begins with [[breath]]. All vocal sounds are created by [[vibrations]] in the [[larynx]] caused by air from the [[lungs]].  [[Breathing]] in everyday life is a [[subconscious]] bodily function which occurs naturally, however the [[singer]] must have control of the intake and exhalation of breath to achieve maximum results from their voice.\n\nNatural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing-out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing there are four stages of breathing:\n# breathing-in period (inhalation)\n# setting up controls period (suspension)\n# controlled exhalation period (phonation)\n# recovery period\nThese stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.<ref name=Sundberg>{{cite journal \n|last=Sundberg\n|first= Johan\n|date=January\u2013February 1993\n|title= Breathing Behavior During Singing\n|journal= The NATS Journal\n|volume= 49\n|pages= 2\u20139, 49\u201351}}</ref>\n\n===Voice classification===\n{{main|Voice type|Voice classification in non-classical music}}\n{{Voice type}}\nIn [[European classical music]] and [[opera]], voices are treated like [[musical instrument]]s. [[Composers]] who write vocal music must have an understanding of  the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. '''Voice classification''' is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into [[voice types]]. These qualities include but are not limited to: [[vocal range]], [[vocal weight]], [[vocal tessitura]], vocal [[timbre]], and [[vocal transition points]] such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and [[vocal registration]].<ref name=\"Shewan\">\n{{cite journal \n |last=Shewan\n |first= Robert\n |date=January\u2013February 1979\n |title= Voice classification: An examination of methodology\n |journal= The NATS Bulletin\n |volume= 35\n |pages= 17\u201327\n}}</ref> The science behind voice classification developed within European [[classical music]] and has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within [[opera]] to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including: the German ''[[Fach]]'' system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.<ref name=\"Stark\">\n{{cite book \n |title= Bel Canto: A history of vocal pedagogy\n |last= Stark \n |first= James\n |year= 2003\n |publisher= University of Toronto Press\n |isbn=978-0-8020-8614-3\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], and [[contralto]]. Men are usually divided into four groups: [[countertenor]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. When considering children's voices, an eighth term, [[boy soprano|treble]], can be applied. Within each of these major categories there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like [[coloratura]] facility and [[vocal weight]] to differentiate between voices.<ref name=\"McKinney\" />\n\nWithin [[choral music]], singers voices are divided solely on the basis of [[vocal range]]. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB). As a result, the typical choral situation affords many opportunities for misclassification to occur.<ref name=\"McKinney\" /> Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.<ref name=\"Smith\">\n{{cite book \n |title= Choral pedagogy\n |last= Smith \n |first= Brenda\n |year= 2005\n |publisher= Plural Publishing\n |isbn=1-59756-043-X\n}}</ref>\n\nWithin contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as [[Contemporary Commercial Music]]), singers are classified by the [[music style|style of music]] they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=Peckham Anne\n |year=2005\n |title=Vocal workouts for the contemporary singer\n |publisher=Berklee Press\n |pages=[https://archive.org/details/vocalworkoutsfor0000peck/page/117 117]\n |isbn=0-87639-047-5\n |url=https://archive.org/details/vocalworkoutsfor0000peck/page/117\n }}</ref> Attempts have been made to adopt classical [[voice type]] terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy. The development of voice categorizations were made with the understanding that the singer would be using classical vocal technique within a specified range using unamplified (no microphones) vocal production. Since contemporary musicians use different vocal techniques, microphones, and are not forced to fit into a specific vocal role, applying such terms as soprano, tenor, baritone, etc. can be misleading or even inaccurate.<ref name=\"Appelman\">\n{{cite book \n |title= The science of vocal pedagogy: theory and application \n |last= Appelman \n |first= Dudley Ralph \n |year= 1986\n |publisher= Indiana University Press \n |pages=434\n |isbn= 0-253-35110-3\n}}</ref>\n\n====Dangers of quick identification====\nMany voice teachers warn of the dangers of quick identification. Premature concern with classification can result in misclassification, with all its attendant dangers. Vennard says:\n\n\"I never feel any urgency about classifying a beginning student. So many premature diagnoses have been proved wrong, and it can be harmful to the student and embarrassing to the teacher to keep striving for an ill-chosen goal. It is best to begin in the middle part of the voice and work upward and downward until the voice classifies itself.\"<ref name=\"Vennard\"/>\n\nMost voice teachers believe that it is essential to establish good vocal habits within a limited and comfortable range before attempting to classify the voice. When techniques of posture, breathing, [[phonation]], resonation, and articulation have become established in this comfortable area, the true quality of the voice will emerge and the upper and lower limits of the range can be explored safely. Only then can a tentative classification be arrived at, and it may be adjusted as the voice continues to develop.<ref name=Greene /> Many acclaimed voice instructors suggest that teachers begin by assuming that a voice is of a medium classification until it proves otherwise. The reason for this is that the majority of individuals possess medium voices and therefore this approach is less likely to misclassify or damage the voice.<ref name=McKinney />\n\n===Vocal registration===\n{{main|Vocal registration}}\n{{Vocal registration}}\n'''Vocal registration''' refers to the system of vocal registers within the human voice. A register in the human voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the [[vocal fold]]s, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in [[larynx|laryngeal]] function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns. Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular [[Vocal range|range]] of [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] and produces certain characteristic sounds.<ref name=\"Large\">\n{{cite journal \n |last=Large\n |first= John\n |date=February\u2013March 1972\n |title= Towards an integrated physiologic-acoustic theory of vocal registers\n |journal= The NATS Bulletin\n |volume= 28\n |pages= 30\u201335\n}}</ref> The term register can be somewhat confusing as it encompasses several aspects of the human voice. The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:<ref name=\"McKinney\"/>\n\n* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.\n* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]].\n* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process\n* A certain vocal [[timbre]]\n* A region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.\n* A subset of a [[language]] used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting.\n\nIn [[linguistics]], a '''register language''' is a language which combines [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and vowel [[phonation]] into a single [[phonology|phonological]] system.\n\nWithin [[speech pathology]] the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many teachers of singing.<ref name=\"McKinney\" />\n\nSome voice teachers, however, organize registers differently. There are over a dozen different constructs of vocal registers in use within the field. The confusion which exists concerning what a register is, and how many registers there are, is due in part to what takes place in the modal register when a person sings from the lowest [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] of that register to the highest pitches. The frequency of vibration of the vocal folds is determined by their length, tension, and mass. As pitch rises, the [[vocal fold]]s are lengthened, tension increases, and their thickness decreases. In other words, all three of these factors are in a state of flux in the transition from the lowest to the highest tones.<ref name=Large />\n\nIf a singer holds any of these factors constant and interferes with their progressive state of change, his [[larynx|laryngeal]] function tends to become static and eventually breaks occur with obvious changes of tone quality. These breaks are often identified as register boundaries or as transition areas between registers. The distinct change or break between registers is called a [[passaggio]] or a [[ponticello]].<ref name=\"oxfordDictOperaOne\">John Warrack, Ewan West. \u2018\u2019The Oxford Dictionary of Opera\u2019\u2019, {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}</ref> Vocal instructors teach that with study a singer can move effortlessly from one register to the other with ease and consistent tone. Registers can even overlap while singing. Teachers who like to use this theory of \"blending registers\" usually help students through the \"passage\" from one register to another by hiding their \"lift\" (where the voice changes).\n\nHowever, many voice instructors disagree with this distinction of boundaries blaming such breaks on vocal problems which have been created by a static laryngeal adjustment that does not permit the necessary changes to take place. This difference of opinion has effected the different views on vocal registration.<ref name=McKinney />\n\n===Coordination===\nSinging is an integrated and coordinated act and it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in, intensively, on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.\n\nOnce the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are:<ref name=\"McKinney\" />\n# Extending the [[vocal range]] to its maximum potential\n# Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality\n# Developing flexibility and agility\n# Achieving a balanced [[vibrato]]\n\n====Developing the singing voice====\nSome consider that singing is not a natural process but is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes, but others consider that some ways of singing can be considered as natural.<ref>{{cite web|title=About|url=https://naturalvoice.net/about|website=Natural Voice Practitioners' Network|accessdate=16 April 2016}} ''For thousands of years all over the world people have sung\u2014to express joy, celebration and grief, to aid healing, to accompany work, devotion and the rituals of life\u2014without worrying about having a \u2018good\u2019 voice or \u2018getting it right\u2019''.</ref> Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Voice teachers instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.<ref name=\"Appelman\"/>\n\n=====Exercising the singing voice=====\nThere are several purposes for vocal exercises, including:<ref name=\"McKinney\" />\n# Warming up the voice\n# Extending the vocal range\n# \"Lining up\" the voice horizontally and vertically\n# Acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to comfortably sing wide intervals, and correcting vocal faults.\n\n=====Extending the vocal range=====\nAn important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Voice instructors teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most voice teachers believe that the first step in coordinating these processes is by establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice first before slowly expanding the range beyond that.<ref name=Vennard/>\n\nThere are three factors which significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:\n#The Energy Factor&nbsp; \u2013 In this usage the word energy has several connotations. It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound. It refers to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism. It also refers to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance that pressure, and it refers to the dynamic level of the sound.\n#The Space Factor&nbsp;\u2013 Space refers to the amount of space created by the moving of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher they sing. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by the relaxing of the throat. Voice teachers often describe this as feeling like the \"beginning of a yawn\".\n#The Depth Factor&nbsp;\u2013 In this usage the word depth has two connotations. It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism and it refers to mental concepts of depth as related to tone quality.\n\nMcKinney says, \"These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less.\"<ref name=\"McKinney\" />\n\n===General music studies===\nSome voice teachers will spend time working with their students on general music knowledge and skills, particularly [[music theory]], [[music history]], and musical styles and practices as it relates to the vocal literature being studied. If required they may also spend time helping their students become better sight readers, often adopting [[solf\u00e8ge]], which assigns certain syllables to the notes of the scale.\n\n===Performance skills and practices===\nSince singing is a performing art, voice teachers spend some of their time preparing their students for performance. This includes teaching their students etiquette of behavior on stage such as bowing, learning to manage stage fright, addressing problems like nervous tics, and the use of equipment such as microphones. Some students may also be preparing for careers in the fields of [[opera]] or [[musical theater]] where acting skills are required. Many voice instructors will spend time on acting techniques and audience communication with students in these fields of interest.

Typical areas of study include:<ref name=McKinney>{{cite book \n|title= The Diagnosis and Correction of Vocal Faults\n|last= McKinney\n|first= James\n|year= 1994\n|publisher= Genovex Music Group\n|isbn= 978-1-56593-940-0}}</ref>\n:\n* [[Human anatomy]] and [[Human physiology|physiology]] as it relates to the physical process of singing.\n* Breathing and air support for singing\n* [[Human position|Posture]] for singing\n* [[Phonation]]\n* [[Vocal resonation]] or [[voice projection]]\n* Diction, vowels and articulation\n* [[Vocal registration]]\n* [[Sostenuto]] and [[legato]] for singing\n* Other singing elements, such as range extension, tone quality, [[vibrato]], [[coloratura]]\n* Vocal health and [[voice disorders]] related to singing\n* Vocal styles, such as learning to sing [[opera]], [[belt (music)|belt]], or [[Art song]]\n* [[Phonetics]]\n* [[Voice classification]]\n\nAll of these different concepts are a part of developing proper '''vocal technique'''. Not all vocal teachers have the same opinions within every topic of study which causes variations in pedagogical approaches and vocal technique.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sanzio 01 Pythagoras.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pythagoras]], the man in the center with the book, teaching music, in [[The School of Athens]] by [[Raphael]]]]\nWithin Western culture, the study of vocal pedagogy began in [[Ancient Greece]]. Scholars such as [[Alypius (music writer)|Alypius]] and [[Pythagoras]] studied and made observations on the art of singing. It is unclear, however, whether the Greeks ever developed a systematic approach to teaching singing as little writing on the subject survives today.<ref name=\"groveONE\">''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians]]''. Edited by [[Stanley Sadie]], ''Volume 6. Edmund to Fryklund''. {{ISBN|1-56159-174-2}}, Copyright Macmillan 1980.</ref>\n\nThe first surviving record of a systematized approach to teaching singing was developed in the [[medieval]] [[monasteries]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] sometime near the beginning of the 13th century. As with other fields of study, the monasteries were the center of musical intellectual life during the medieval period and many men within the monasteries devoted their time to the study of music and the art of singing. Highly influential in the development of a vocal pedagogical system were monks [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] and [[Jerome of Moravia]] who were the first to develop a concept of [[vocal registers]]. These men identified three registers: [[chest voice]], [[throat voice]], and [[head voice]] (pectoris, guttoris, and capitis). Their concept of head voice, however, is much more similar to the modern pedagogists understanding of the [[falsetto register]]. Other concepts discussed in the monastic system included [[vocal resonance]], [[voice classification]], breath support, diction, and tone quality to name a few. The ideas developed within the monastic system highly influenced the development of vocal pedagogy over the next several centuries including the [[Bel canto|Bel Canto]] style of singing.<ref name=\"groveONE\"/>\n\nWith the onset of the [[Renaissance]] in the 15th century, the study of singing began to move outside of the church. The courts of rich patrons, such as the Dukes of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] who supported the [[Burgundian School]] and the [[Franco-Flemish School]], became secular centers of study for singing and all other areas of musical study. The vocal pedagogical methods taught in these schools, however, were based on the concepts developed within the monastic system. Many of the teachers within these schools had their initial musical training from singing in church choirs as children. The church also remained at the forefront of musical composition at this time and remained highly influential in shaping musical tastes and practices both in and outside the church. It was the Catholic Church that first popularized the use of [[castrato]] singers in the 16th century, which ultimately led to the popularity of castrato voices in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] [[operas]].<ref name=\"Stark\"/>\n\nIt was not until the development of opera in the 17th century that vocal pedagogy began to break away from some of the established thinking of the monastic writers and develop deeper understandings of the physical process of singing and its relation to key concepts like [[vocal registration]] and [[vocal resonation]]. It was also during this time, that noted [[voice teacher]]s began to emerge. [[Giulio Caccini]] is an example of an important early Italian voice teacher.<ref name=\"groveONE\"/> In the late 17th century, the [[bel canto]] method of singing began to develop in Italy. This style of singing had a huge impact on the development of opera and the development of vocal pedagogy during the [[Classical music era|Classical]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] periods. It was during this time, that teachers and composers first began to identify singers by and write roles for more specific [[voice types]]. However, it wasn't until the 19th century that more clearly defined voice classification systems like the German [[Fach]] system emerged. Within these systems, more descriptive terms were used in classifying voices such as [[coloratura soprano]] and [[lyric soprano]].<ref name=Stark/>\n\n[[File:Garcia-Laryngoskop.gif|thumb|left|175px|Examining the vocal mechanism with a [[laryngoscope]], late 19th century]]\nVoice teachers in the 19th century continued to train singers for careers in opera.  [[Manuel Patricio Rodr\u00edguez Garc\u00eda]] is often considered one of the most important voice teachers of the 19th century, and is credited with the development of the [[laryngoscope]] and the beginning of modern voice pedagogy.\n[[File:Matilde Marchesi.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Mathilde Marchesi]] was both an important singer and teacher of singing at the turn of the 20th century.]]\nThe field of voice pedagogy became more fully developed in the middle of the 20th century.  A few American voice teachers began to study the science, anatomy, and physiology of singing, especially [[Ralph Appelman]] at [[Indiana University]], [[Oren Brown]] at the [[Washington University School of Medicine]] and later the [[Juilliard School]], and [[William Vennard]] at the [[University of Southern California]].  This shift in approach to the study of singing led to the rejection of many of the assertions of the [[bel canto]] singing method, most particularly in the areas of [[vocal registration]] and [[vocal resonation]].<ref name=Gurnee>{{cite book \n|title= In Memoriam: William D. Vennard\n|last= Gurnee\n|first=  Robert T. \n|year= 1986\n|publisher= [[The NATS Bulletin]]\n}}</ref> As a result, there are currently two predominating schools of thought among voice teachers today, those who maintain the historical positions of the [[bel canto]] method and those who choose to embrace more contemporary understandings based in current knowledge of human anatomy and physiology. There are also those teachers who borrow ideas from both perspectives, creating a hybrid of the two.<ref name=\"Vennard\">\n{{cite book \n |title= Singing: the mechanism and the technic\n |last= Vennard\n |first= William\n |year= 1967\n |publisher=[[Carl Fischer Music]]\n |isbn=978-0-8258-0055-9\n}}</ref><ref name=Appelman/>\n\nAppelman and Vennard were also part of a group of voice instructors who developed courses of study for beginning voice teachers, adding these scientific ideas to the standard exercises and empirical ways to improve vocal technique, and by 1980 the subject of voice pedagogy was beginning to be included in many college music degree programs for singers and vocal music educators.<ref name=Gurnee/>\n\nMore recent works by authors such as [[Richard Miller (singer)|Richard Miller]] and Johan Sundberg have increased the general knowledge of voice teachers, and scientific and practical aspects of voice pedagogy continue to be studied and discussed by professionals.  In addition, the creation of organisations such as the [[National Association of Teachers of Singing]] (now an international organization of Vocal Instructors) has enabled voice teachers to establish more of a consensus about their work, and has expanded the understanding of what singing teachers do.<ref name=McKinney/><ref name = \"Miller\">{{cite book\n  | last = Miller\n  | first = Richard\n  | authorlink = Richard Miller (singer)\n  | title = The Structure of Singing\n  | publisher = [[Schirmer Books]]\n  | year = 1986\n  | isbn = 0-02-872660-X\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/structureofsingi0000mill\n  }}</ref>\n\n==Topics of study==\n\n===Pedagogical philosophy===\nThere are basically three major approaches to vocal pedagogy, all related to how the  mechanistic and psychological controls are employed within the act of singing. Some voice instructors advocate an extreme mechanistic approach that believes that singing is largely a matter of getting the right physical parts in the right places at the right time, and that correcting vocal faults is accomplished by calling direct attention to the parts which are not working well. On the other extreme, is the school of thought that believes that attention should never be directed to any part of the vocal mechanism\u2014that singing is a matter of producing the right mental images of the desired tone, and that correcting vocal faults is achieved by learning to think the right thoughts and by releasing the emotions through interpretation of the music. Most voice teachers, however, believe that the truth lies somewhere in between the two extremes and adopt a composite of those two approaches.<ref name=\"Greene\">\n{{cite book \n |title= The voice and its disorders \n |author= Greene Margaret, Mathieson Lesley \n |year= 2001\n |publisher= John Wiley & Sons \n |edition=6th\n |isbn=1-86156-196-2\n}}</ref>\n\n===The nature of vocal sounds===\n\n====Physiology of vocal sound production====\n[[File:Illu bronchi lungs.jpg|350px|right]]\nThere are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: [[Breathing|respiration]], [[phonation]], [[vocal resonation|resonation]], and [[Place of articulation|articulation]]. These processes occur in the following sequence: \n#Breath is taken\n#Sound is initiated in the [[larynx]]\n#The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it\n#The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units\nAlthough these four processes are to be considered separately, in actual practice they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.<ref name=\"Appelman\"/>\n\n=====Respiration=====\n[[File:Gray1204.png|right|300px|thumb|A labeled anatomical diagram of the [[vocal folds]] or cords.]]\nIn its most basic sense, respiration is the process of moving air in and out of the body\u2014inhalation and exhalation. Sound is produced in the Larynx. But producing the sound would not be possible without a power source: the flow of air from the lungs. This flow sets the vocal folds into motion to produce sound.<ref>'Anatomy of the Voice' by Theodore Dimon, Illustration by G. David Brown. {{ISBN|978-1-62317-197-1}} </ref>  Breathing for singing and speaking is a more controlled process than is the ordinary breathing used for sustaining life. The controls applied to exhalation are particularly important in good vocal technique.<ref name=\"Appelman\"/>\n\n=====Phonation=====\n[[Phonation]] is the process of producing vocal sound by the vibration of the [[vocal folds]] that is in turn modified by the resonance of the [[vocal tract]].<ref>Titze, I. R. (2008). The human instrument. Sci.Am. 298 (1):94\u2013101. PM 18225701</ref><ref>Titze, I.R. (1994). Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall (currently published by NCVS.org), {{ISBN|978-0-13-717893-3}}.</ref> It takes place in the [[larynx]] when the [[vocal folds]] are brought together and breath pressure is applied to them in such a way that vibration ensues causing an audible source of acoustic energy, i.e., sound, which can then be modified by the articulatory actions of the rest of the [[vocal apparatus]]. The vocal folds are brought together primarily by the action of the interarytenoid muscles, which pull the [[arytenoid cartilages]] together.<ref name=McKinney/>\n\n=====Resonation=====\n{{main|Vocal resonation}}\n[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.<ref name=\"McKinney\" />\n\nThere are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the [[human chest|chest]], the [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal tree]], the [[larynx]] itself, the [[human pharynx|pharynx]], the [[human oral cavity|oral cavity]], the [[nasal cavity]], and the [[sinuses]].<ref name=\"Greene\"/>\n\nResearch has shown that the larynx, the pharynx and the oral cavity are the main resonators of vocal sound, with the nasal cavity only coming into play in nasal consonants, or nasal vowels, such as those found in French. This main resonating space, from above the vocal folds to the lips is known as the [[vocal tract]]. Many voice users experience sensations in the sinuses that may be misconstrued as resonance. However, these sensations are caused by sympathetic vibrations, and are a result, rather than a cause, of efficient vocal resonance.<ref name = \"Miller\"/>\n\n=====Articulation=====\n{{main|Place of articulation}}\n[[File:Places of articulation.svg|thumb|200px|Places of articulation (passive & active):<br />1. Exo-labial, 2. Endo-labial, 3. Dental, 4. Alveolar, 5. Post-alveolar, 6. Pre-palatal, 7. Palatal, 8. Velar, 9. Uvular, 10. Pharyngeal, 11. Glottal, 12. Epiglottal, 13. Radical, 14. Postero-dorsal, 15. Antero-dorsal, 16. Laminal, 17. Apical, 18. Sub-apical]]\nArticulation is the process by which the joint product of the vibrator and the resonators is shaped into recognizable speech sounds through the muscular adjustments and movements of the speech organs. These adjustments and movements of the articulators result in verbal communication and thus form the essential difference between the human voice and other musical instruments. Singing without understandable words limits the voice to nonverbal communication.<ref name=\"Greene\"/> In relation to the physical process of singing, vocal instructors tend to focus more on active articulation as opposed to passive articulation. There are five basic active articulators: the lip (\"[[labial consonant]]s\"), the flexible front of the tongue (\"[[coronal consonant]]s\"), the middle/back of the tongue (\"[[dorsal consonant]]s\"), the root of the tongue together with the [[epiglottis]] (\"[[pharyngeal consonant]]s\"), and the [[glottis]] (\"[[glottal consonant]]s\"). These articulators can act independently of each other, and two or more may work together in what is called ''coarticulation''.\n\nUnlike active articulation, passive articulation is a continuum without many clear-cut boundaries. The places linguolabial and interdental, interdental and dental, dental and alveolar, alveolar and palatal, palatal and velar, velar and uvular merge into one another, and a consonant may be pronounced somewhere between the named places.\n\nIn addition, when the front of the tongue is used, it may be the upper surface or ''blade'' of the tongue that makes contact (\"[[laminal consonant]]s\"), the tip of the tongue (\"[[apical consonant]]s\"), or the under surface (\"[[sub-apical consonant]]s\"). These articulations also merge into one another without clear boundaries.\n\n=====Interpretation=====\nInterpretation is sometimes listed by voice teachers as a fifth physical process even though strictly speaking it is not a physical process. The reason for this is that interpretation does influence the kind of sound a singer makes which is ultimately achieved through a physical action the singer is doing. Although teachers may acquaint their students with musical styles and performance practices and suggest certain interpretive effects, most voice teachers agree that interpretation can not be taught. Students who lack a natural creative imagination and aesthetic sensibility can not learn it from someone else. Failure to interpret well is not a vocal fault, even though it may affect vocal sound significantly.<ref name=\"McKinney\"/>\n\n====Classification of vocal sounds====\nVocal sounds are divided into two basic categories-[[vowels]] and [[consonants]]-with a wide variety of sub-classifications. Voice Teachers and serious voice students spend a great deal of time studying how the voice forms vowels and consonants, and studying the problems that certain consonants or vowels may cause while singing. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is used frequently by voice teachers and their students.<ref name=\"Greene\"/>\n\n====Problems in describing vocal sounds====\nDescribing vocal sound is an inexact science largely because the [[human voice]] is a self-contained instrument. Since the vocal instrument is internal, the singer's ability to monitor the sound produced is complicated by the vibrations carried to the ear through the Eustachean (auditory) tube and the bony structures of the head and neck. In other words, most singers hear something different in their ears/head than what a person listening to them hears. As a result, voice teachers often focus less on how it \"sounds\" and more on how it \"feels\". Vibratory sensations resulting from the closely related processes of phonation and resonation, and kinesthetic ones arising from muscle tension, movement, body position, and weight serve as a guide to the singer on correct vocal production.\n\nAnother problem in describing vocal sound lies in the vocal vocabulary itself. There are many schools of thought within vocal pedagogy and different schools have adopted different terms, sometimes from other artistic disciplines. This has led to the use of a plethora of descriptive terms applied to the voice which are not always understood to mean the same thing. Some terms sometimes used to describe a quality of a voice's sound are: warm, white, dark, light, round, reedy, spread, focused, covered, swallowed, forward, ringing, hooty, bleaty, plummy, mellow, pear-shaped, and so forth.<ref name=\"Appelman\"/>\n\n===Body alignment===\nThe singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body exist. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the body alignment of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the [[diaphragmatic breathing|diaphragm]]. Good body alignment allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good body alignment also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Voice Instructors have also noted that when singers assume good body alignment it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good body alignment. Habitual good body alignment also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.<ref name=\"Vennard\"/>\n\n===Breathing and breath support===\nIn the words of Robert C. White, who paraphrased a \"Credo\" for singing:\n<blockquote>\nIn the Beginning there was Breath, and Singing was with Breath, and Singing was Breath, and Singing ''was'' Breath. And all singing was made by the Breath, and without Breath was not any Singing made that was made. (White 1988, p. 26)\n</blockquote>\n\nAll singing begins with [[breath]]. All vocal sounds are created by [[vibrations]] in the [[larynx]] caused by air from the [[lungs]].  [[Breathing]] in everyday life is a [[subconscious]] bodily function which occurs naturally, however the [[singer]] must have control of the intake and exhalation of breath to achieve maximum results from their voice.\n\nNatural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing-out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing there are four stages of breathing:\n# breathing-in period (inhalation)\n# setting up controls period (suspension)\n# controlled exhalation period (phonation)\n# recovery period\nThese stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.<ref name=Sundberg>{{cite journal \n|last=Sundberg\n|first= Johan\n|date=January\u2013February 1993\n|title= Breathing Behavior During Singing\n|journal= The NATS Journal\n|volume= 49\n|pages= 2\u20139, 49\u201351}}</ref>\n\n===Voice classification===\n{{main|Voice type|Voice classification in non-classical music}}\n{{Voice type}}\nIn [[European classical music]] and [[opera]], voices are treated like [[musical instrument]]s. [[Composers]] who write vocal music must have an understanding of  the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. '''Voice classification''' is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into [[voice types]]. These qualities include but are not limited to: [[vocal range]], [[vocal weight]], [[vocal tessitura]], vocal [[timbre]], and [[vocal transition points]] such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and [[vocal registration]].<ref name=\"Shewan\">\n{{cite journal \n |last=Shewan\n |first= Robert\n |date=January\u2013February 1979\n |title= Voice classification: An examination of methodology\n |journal= The NATS Bulletin\n |volume= 35\n |pages= 17\u201327\n}}</ref> The science behind voice classification developed within European [[classical music]] and has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within [[opera]] to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including: the German ''[[Fach]]'' system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.<ref name=\"Stark\">\n{{cite book \n |title= Bel Canto: A history of vocal pedagogy\n |last= Stark \n |first= James\n |year= 2003\n |publisher= University of Toronto Press\n |isbn=978-0-8020-8614-3\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], and [[contralto]]. Men are usually divided into four groups: [[countertenor]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. When considering children's voices, an eighth term, [[boy soprano|treble]], can be applied. Within each of these major categories there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like [[coloratura]] facility and [[vocal weight]] to differentiate between voices.<ref name=\"McKinney\" />\n\nWithin [[choral music]], singers voices are divided solely on the basis of [[vocal range]]. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB). As a result, the typical choral situation affords many opportunities for misclassification to occur.<ref name=\"McKinney\" /> Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.<ref name=\"Smith\">\n{{cite book \n |title= Choral pedagogy\n |last= Smith \n |first= Brenda\n |year= 2005\n |publisher= Plural Publishing\n |isbn=1-59756-043-X\n}}</ref>\n\nWithin contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as [[Contemporary Commercial Music]]), singers are classified by the [[music style|style of music]] they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=Peckham Anne\n |year=2005\n |title=Vocal workouts for the contemporary singer\n |publisher=Berklee Press\n |pages=[https://archive.org/details/vocalworkoutsfor0000peck/page/117 117]\n |isbn=0-87639-047-5\n |url=https://archive.org/details/vocalworkoutsfor0000peck/page/117\n }}</ref> Attempts have been made to adopt classical [[voice type]] terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy. The development of voice categorizations were made with the understanding that the singer would be using classical vocal technique within a specified range using unamplified (no microphones) vocal production. Since contemporary musicians use different vocal techniques, microphones, and are not forced to fit into a specific vocal role, applying such terms as soprano, tenor, baritone, etc. can be misleading or even inaccurate.<ref name=\"Appelman\">\n{{cite book \n |title= The science of vocal pedagogy: theory and application \n |last= Appelman \n |first= Dudley Ralph \n |year= 1986\n |publisher= Indiana University Press \n |pages=434\n |isbn= 0-253-35110-3\n}}</ref>\n\n====Dangers of quick identification====\nMany voice teachers warn of the dangers of quick identification. Premature concern with classification can result in misclassification, with all its attendant dangers. Vennard says:\n\n\"I never feel any urgency about classifying a beginning student. So many premature diagnoses have been proved wrong, and it can be harmful to the student and embarrassing to the teacher to keep striving for an ill-chosen goal. It is best to begin in the middle part of the voice and work upward and downward until the voice classifies itself.\"<ref name=\"Vennard\"/>\n\nMost voice teachers believe that it is essential to establish good vocal habits within a limited and comfortable range before attempting to classify the voice. When techniques of posture, breathing, [[phonation]], resonation, and articulation have become established in this comfortable area, the true quality of the voice will emerge and the upper and lower limits of the range can be explored safely. Only then can a tentative classification be arrived at, and it may be adjusted as the voice continues to develop.<ref name=Greene /> Many acclaimed voice instructors suggest that teachers begin by assuming that a voice is of a medium classification until it proves otherwise. The reason for this is that the majority of individuals possess medium voices and therefore this approach is less likely to misclassify or damage the voice.<ref name=McKinney />\n\n===Vocal registration===\n{{main|Vocal registration}}\n{{Vocal registration}}\n'''Vocal registration''' refers to the system of vocal registers within the human voice. A register in the human voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the [[vocal fold]]s, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in [[larynx|laryngeal]] function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns. Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular [[Vocal range|range]] of [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] and produces certain characteristic sounds.<ref name=\"Large\">\n{{cite journal \n |last=Large\n |first= John\n |date=February\u2013March 1972\n |title= Towards an integrated physiologic-acoustic theory of vocal registers\n |journal= The NATS Bulletin\n |volume= 28\n |pages= 30\u201335\n}}</ref> The term register can be somewhat confusing as it encompasses several aspects of the human voice. The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:<ref name=\"McKinney\"/>\n\n* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.\n* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]].\n* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process\n* A certain vocal [[timbre]]\n* A region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.\n* A subset of a [[language]] used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting.\n\nIn [[linguistics]], a '''register language''' is a language which combines [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and vowel [[phonation]] into a single [[phonology|phonological]] system.\n\nWithin [[speech pathology]] the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many teachers of singing.<ref name=\"McKinney\" />\n\nSome voice teachers, however, organize registers differently. There are over a dozen different constructs of vocal registers in use within the field. The confusion which exists concerning what a register is, and how many registers there are, is due in part to what takes place in the modal register when a person sings from the lowest [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] of that register to the highest pitches. The frequency of vibration of the vocal folds is determined by their length, tension, and mass. As pitch rises, the [[vocal fold]]s are lengthened, tension increases, and their thickness decreases. In other words, all three of these factors are in a state of flux in the transition from the lowest to the highest tones.<ref name=Large />\n\nIf a singer holds any of these factors constant and interferes with their progressive state of change, his [[larynx|laryngeal]] function tends to become static and eventually breaks occur with obvious changes of tone quality. These breaks are often identified as register boundaries or as transition areas between registers. The distinct change or break between registers is called a [[passaggio]] or a [[ponticello]].<ref name=\"oxfordDictOperaOne\">John Warrack, Ewan West. \u2018\u2019The Oxford Dictionary of Opera\u2019\u2019, {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}</ref> Vocal instructors teach that with study a singer can move effortlessly from one register to the other with ease and consistent tone. Registers can even overlap while singing. Teachers who like to use this theory of \"blending registers\" usually help students through the \"passage\" from one register to another by hiding their \"lift\" (where the voice changes).\n\nHowever, many voice instructors disagree with this distinction of boundaries blaming such breaks on vocal problems which have been created by a static laryngeal adjustment that does not permit the necessary changes to take place. This difference of opinion has effected the different views on vocal registration.<ref name=McKinney />\n\n===Coordination===\nSinging is an integrated and coordinated act and it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in, intensively, on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.\n\nOnce the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are:<ref name=\"McKinney\" />\n# Extending the [[vocal range]] to its maximum potential\n# Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality\n# Developing flexibility and agility\n# Achieving a balanced [[vibrato]]\n\n====Developing the singing voice====\nSome consider that singing is not a natural process but is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes, but others consider that some ways of singing can be considered as natural.<ref>{{cite web|title=About|url=https://naturalvoice.net/about|website=Natural Voice Practitioners' Network|accessdate=16 April 2016}} ''For thousands of years all over the world people have sung\u2014to express joy, celebration and grief, to aid healing, to accompany work, devotion and the rituals of life\u2014without worrying about having a \u2018good\u2019 voice or \u2018getting it right\u2019''.</ref> Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Voice teachers instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.<ref name=\"Appelman\"/>\n\n=====Exercising the singing voice=====\nThere are several purposes for vocal exercises, including:<ref name=\"McKinney\" />\n# Warming up the voice\n# Extending the vocal range\n# \"Lining up\" the voice horizontally and vertically\n# Acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to comfortably sing wide intervals, and correcting vocal faults.\n\n=====Extending the vocal range=====\nAn important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Voice instructors teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most voice teachers believe that the first step in coordinating these processes is by establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice first before slowly expanding the range beyond that.<ref name=Vennard/>\n\nThere are three factors which significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:\n#The Energy Factor&nbsp; \u2013 In this usage the word energy has several connotations. It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound. It refers to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism. It also refers to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance that pressure, and it refers to the dynamic level of the sound.\n#The Space Factor&nbsp;\u2013 Space refers to the amount of space created by the moving of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher they sing. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by the relaxing of the throat. Voice teachers often describe this as feeling like the \"beginning of a yawn\".\n#The Depth Factor&nbsp;\u2013 In this usage the word depth has two connotations. It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism and it refers to mental concepts of depth as related to tone quality.\n\nMcKinney says, \"These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less.\"<ref name=\"McKinney\" />\n\n===General music studies===\nSome voice teachers will spend time working with their students on general music knowledge and skills, particularly [[music theory]], [[music history]], and musical styles and practices as it relates to the vocal literature being studied. If required they may also spend time helping their students become better sight readers, often adopting [[solf\u00e8ge]], which assigns certain syllables to the notes of the scale.\n\n===Performance skills and practices===\nSince singing is a performing art, voice teachers spend some of their time preparing their students for performance. This includes teaching their students etiquette of behavior on stage such as bowing, learning to manage stage fright, addressing problems like nervous tics, and the use of equipment such as microphones. Some students may also be preparing for careers in the fields of [[opera]] or [[musical theater]] where acting skills are required. Many voice instructors will spend time on acting techniques and audience communication with students in these fields of interest. Students of opera also spend a great deal of time with their voice teachers learning foreign language pronunciations.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Human voice]]\n* [[Voice teacher]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book\n | last1=Thurman\n | first1=Leon\n | last2=Welch, ed.\n | first2=Graham\n | title=Bodymind & voice: Foundations of voice education\n | publisher=The VoiceCare Network et al.\n | place=Collegeville, Minnesota\n | edition=revised\n | year=2012\n | isbn = 0-87414-123-0 }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://carbon.cudenver.edu/~jcoe/vocalped_timeline.htm Historical vocal pedagogy]\n*[http://www.nats.org National Association of Teachers of Singing]\n*[http://www.singinglessons1.com Articles & Guidance for Singing Better]\n*[http://www.vocapedia.info/ Vocapedia, NATS-sponsored comprehensive database on singing and vocal pedagogy]\n\n{{Vocal music}}\n\n[[Category:Human voice]]\n[[Category:Singing]]\n[[Category:Opera terminology]]\n[[Category:Vocal coaches|*]]\n[[Category:Vocal skills]]\n", "name_user": "Espoo", "label": "safe", "comment": "voice, not vocal teacher", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_pedagogy"}

Since 1974 the team and association have been headquartered in [[Park City, Utah]].<ref>http://www.ussa.org/magnoliaPublic/ussa/en/about/history.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201142750/http://ussa.org/magnoliaPublic/ussa/en/about/history.html |date=2010-12-01 }} USSA history information</ref>\n\nThese athletes represent the best athletes in the country for their respective sports and compete as a team at the national, world and Olympic level.\n\n== History ==\n''*The first U.S. Ski Team was officially named in 1965 for the 1966 season, however the United States participated in skiing at all Olympic Winter Games and sent various athletes to World Championships prior to the '66 season.''\n\n'''1882 - First U.S. Ski Club Founded'''\n\nThe first ski club in the United States was founded in 1882. The [[Nansen Ski Club]] of [[Berlin, New Hampshire]], was founded by [[Norway|Norwegian]] immigrants and named in honor of Norway's legendary Arctic explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen]]. It continues to operate.\n\n'''1905 - National Ski Association Founded'''\n\nThe National Ski Association, the forerunner of the present-day [[United States Ski and Snowboard Association]], was founded on Feb. 21, 1905 in [[Ishpeming, Michigan]]. A meeting was held by the Ishpeming Ski Club in conjunction with a 1904 ski jumping meet in Ishpeming - but the association was not formed at that gathering. Club President [[Carl Tellefsen]] proposed holding a meeting after the 1905 jumping meet \u2013 a national meet - to found a ski association which, among other duties, would oversee jumping tournaments. In 1905, the association was formally organized during a meeting attended by officers from the Ishpeming, Minneapolis, Red Wing, Stillwater and Eau Claire ski clubs. On Feb. 21, 1905, Carl Tellefsen announced the National Ski Association - and said he was its first president.\n\n'''1910 - International Ski Commission Formed'''\n\nSkiing grew throughout the last two decades of the 19th Century in Europe, including [[Russia]]; the first ski club in [[Switzerland]] was formed in 1863 and national associations were created in Russia (1896), [[Czechoslovakia]] (1903), the [[United States]], [[Austria]] and [[Germany]] (all in 1905) and Norway, [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] (1908).\n\nIn 1910, the International Ski Commission was formed to monitor development of skiing globally. On Feb. 2, 1924 in Chamonix, [[France]], while what would come to be recognized as the first [[Winter Olympic Games]] were being held, the commission gave way to the International Ski Federation; 14 member nations were present at the founding; 108 are FIS members today.\n\n'''1924 - Jan. 25-Feb. 4 - Inaugural Olympic Winter Games - Chamonix, France'''\n\nThe first Winter Olympic Games actually were under the banner of International Sports Week, but were renamed the Winter Olympic Games in 1925 after organizers saw how successful they were (and after Norway, which had opposed \"Winter Olympic\" events because of concern Norwegians wouldn't dominate, saw it would be a winter power) supported the concept. Ski events were only Nordic, including cross country, ski jumping (then the premier ski event everywhere) and Nordic combined. Sixteen nations competed.\n\n[[Anders Haugen]], a Norwegian [[immigrant]] to the United States, was listed as fourth in ski jumping because of a calculation error. In 1974, as Norwegians prepared to celebrate the 50th anniversary of those first Winter Games, a recalculation in [[Oslo]] found Haugen was the real bronze medalist and not Thorleif Haug (1894\u20131934). A medal presentation was arranged in Oslo, where a frail Haugen received the bronze medal from the daughter of Thorleif Haug, who had been dead since the Thirties. Haugen's medal remains the only jumping medal won by an American in the Olympics or World Championships. Originally, the IOC did not recognize the medal exchange and kept Haug listed as its 1924 bronze medalist for years before recognizing Haugen as the legitimate medal-winner.<ref>[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Thorleif_Haug/utdypning ''Thorleif Haug'' (Store norske leksikon)]</ref>\n\n'''1925 - First World Nordic Championships held in Johannisbad, Czechoslovakia'''\n\n'''1931 - First World Alpine Championships held in Murren, Switzerland'''\n\nSkiing was still primarily a European sport in the Twenties. Although the United States participated in the Winter Olympics of 1924, '28 and '32 - where there were only Nordic events, there was no US Ski Team. Athletes were selected for the various championships.\n\n'''1932 - Feb. 4-15 - Olympic Winter Games - Lake Placid, New York'''\n\nThe 1932 Summer Games were headed to [[Los Angeles]], but Godfrey Dewey \u2013 whose father had founded the [[Lake Placid Club]] \u2013 out-foxed a half-dozen other candidates (including [[Denver]]; [[Minneapolis]] and [[Duluth, Minnesota]]; [[Yosemite]] and [[Lake Tahoe]], California; and [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]], New York). Then-Gov. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] pledged to build a [[bobsled]] run and Dewey, who had finagled a posting as manager of the 1928 Olympic Ski Team, parlayed those contacts to land the \u201932 Winter Olympics for the small [[Adirondacks]] village. Some 300 athletes from 17 nations competed. Skiing was still a Nordic show; top US skier was another jumper, [[Casper Oimoen]], who finished fifth.\n\n''*** This was the first major international ski event in the United States''\n\n'''1935 - US sends first alpine team to FIS World Championships'''\n\nThe championships returned to Murren, Switzerland, site of the first official alpine championships in 1931. Six men, seven women were on that first official US squad at Worlds.\n\n'''1936 - Feb. 6-16 - Alpine added to Olympic Winter Games - Garmisch-Partenkirchen, [[Germany]]'''\n\nAlpine skiing was introduced with to the Olympics with a single event, the combined (one downhill run and two slalom runs). While Nordic remained an all-male province, alpine was opened to men and women. Germans took gold and silver in both the men's and women's alpine combined events; Franz Pfnuer and Christl Cranz were the new champions; Dick Durrance, who grew up in [[Florida]] but spent several years in Germany learning to ski before [[Hitler]] took power, was the runaway best US skier, finishing 10th.\n\nFor the only time, the FIS authorized a World Championships in addition to the Olympics with alpine championship races held in [[Innsbruck]], Austria.\n\n'''1948 - Jan. 30-Feb. 8 - Olympics return with first US alpine medals - St. Moritz, Switzerland'''\n\nThe Olympics (with Germany and [[Japan]] barred from competing) returned after a 12-year hiatus, with American Gretchen Fraser (then of Vancouver, WA, later of Sun Valley, ID) winning the first two US Olympic ski medals \u2013 and they came on the same day, Feb. 5; the combined downhill had been run the previous day and when she won the slalom, it gave her second place in the combined calculation. In addition to the combined, which debuted in 1936, alpine added both elements of combined as individual events, meaning alpine was now equal with Nordic, having three events (slalom, downhill and the combined; however, there were no women's Nordic events until 1952).\n \nFraser led US skiers, collecting the first medals by a US skier - gold in slalom and silver in combined. The US women included a talented young teen \u2013 Andrea Mead, 15, whose parents owned Pico Peak, near Rutland, VT.\n\nAlso of note, Gordy Wren (Steamboat Springs, CO) qualified for all four individual ski teams. He eventually competed only in jumping. \"I was going ragged, bumping into myself, trying to train, ski alpine, cross country and the rest, so I decided to focus on jumping,\" he explained. He finished fifth.\n\n'''1950 - World Championships in USA, Lake Placid, NY (Nordic) and Aspen, CO (alpine)'''\n\nPoor snow in the Adirondacks almost forced cancellation of the Nordic events, but, alerted by 1948 Olympic cross country racer \"Chummy\" Broomhall that there was more than a foot of snow in his hometown of [[Rumford, Maine]], officials agreed to stage opening ceremonies and the jumping events in Lake Placid, then everyone drove to Rumford for the cross country competitions. At one point, Broomhall helped set the race tracks \u2013 no machine-setting equipment in those days, so skiers would ski-in the tracks \u2013 and then went home to change into his racing outfit; traffic at the site meant Broomhall missed his scheduled start time, but officials let him run at the end of the pack.\n\nThe alpine Worlds, organized by racing great Dick Durrance, then general manager at the fledgling [[Aspen Mountain (ski area)|Aspen Ski Area]], included slalom, downhill, and the first appearance of giant slalom. American [[Katy Rodolph]] of Colorado led the US, finishing fifth in the women's downhill. [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] was established as an alpine destination as a result of the successful World Championships.\n\n'''1960 - Feb. 18-28 - Olympics return to USA - Squaw Valley, CA'''\n\nThe young [[Squaw Valley Ski Resort|Squaw Valley]] resort near [[Lake Tahoe]] in California ushered in a new Olympic era under the direction of Alex Cushing. No bobsled run was built but the skiing was memorable. In cross country, Squaw Valley introduced the initial machine-set tracks; everything had been walked or skied in before Squaw Valley but \u2013 with Al Merrill and Chummy Broomhall setting the tone as chief of competition and chief of course, respectively \u2013 snow machines were used to help groom Nordic courses for the first time.\n\n'''1962 - NSA renamed US Ski Association'''\n\nThe 57-year-old National Ski Association got a new name as the U.S. Ski Association. The renamed organization moved from Denver to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], CO.\n\nAlso, the US Ski Education Foundation, designed to \"Establish, administer and promote educational programs devoted to the development and training of skiers\" and promote ski museums, was founded Oct. 8, 1862 (and chartered June 13, 1964). By enabling donors to receive tax deductions for contributions, it would become the fundraising arm of the US Ski Team, the forerunner of the US Ski and Snowboard Team Foundation.\n\n'''1964 - Jan. 29-Feb. 9 - U.S. alpine men earn first Olympic medals - Innsbruck, Austria'''\n\nThe Olympics came to Austria for the first time in 1964. US men earned their first medals Feb. 8 as [[Billy Kidd]] (Stowe, VT) won silver in slalom and [[Jimmie Heuga]] (Tahoe City, CA) took slalom bronze. Jean Saubert (Hillsborough, OR) was a double medalist, tying for silver in giant slalom and collecting bronze in slalom.\n\n'''1965 - Bob Beattie named U.S. Ski Team alpine head coach'''\n\nOn June 21, 1965, the USSA took the first steps in the formation of a formal US Ski Team by naming its first head alpine coach. At the annual USSA convention on June 21 in Spokane, WA, [[Bob Beattie (skiing)|Bob Beattie]] was named the first full-time US alpine skiing head coach. \"When you think you're going too fast--accelerate!\" he would goad team members. [[Chuck Ferries]], a 1964 Olympian, was named assistant coach, with primary responsibilities as head coach of the women's alpine team. Ferries took leave from his job with Head Ski Co. to coach, and was named full-time women's coach in 1966. No full-time Nordic jumping or skiing coaches were yet designated.\n\n'''1973 - National Training Centers created'''\n\nNational Training Centers were created for both national alpine and Nordic teams. It was opened Oct. 28 in three old, mid-mountain, mining buildings at Park City Ski Area (now Park City Mountain Resort). Former Alpine Director [[Willy Schaeffler]] was the center's director.\n\n'''1974 - U.S. Ski Team moves to Park City, UT'''\n\nIn the summer of 1974 the alpine portion of the US Ski Team relocated from USSA's Denver office to [[Park City, Utah]]. The athletes and coaches began utilizing the Alpine Training Center, a building designed by Willy Schaeffler, that opened in old mining buildings at Park City Ski Area. Administrative offices were set up in the old Mountain Air Grocery on lower Main Street. Eventually, the Ski Team move up the hill to the old Treasure Mountain Inn.\n\n'''1976 - USSA and U.S. Ski Team split'''\n\nIn 1976 the USSA and the US Ski Team agreed to part ways. The USSA continued to control the rules and governance of the sport, as well as organizing travel programs for recreational skiers, while the US Ski Team focused solely on the elite national team.\n\n'''1988 - USSA and U.S. Ski Team rejoin'''\n\nAfter years of operating separately, the USSA and U.S. Ski Team were merged once again in the Summer of 1998 under the direction of [[Thomas Weisel]]. Weisel proposed the creation of a \u2018super-board\u2019 consisting of 15 people representing the leadership of both organizations. USSA CEO Howard Peterson was selected to lead the new  organization and the USSA moved its national offices from Colorado Springs to join the U.S. Ski Team in [[Park City, UT]], establishing its headquarters at its present location on 1500 Kearns Blvd.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Richard L.|title=Capital Instincts: Life as an Entrepreneur, Financier, and Athlete|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0471214175|pages=149-151|edition=1|url=https://www.amazon.com/Capital-Instincts-Entrepreneur-Financier-Athlete/dp/0471214175|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''2007 - Center of Excellence Groundbreaking'''\n\nThe USSA broke ground on the [http://www.usskiteam.com/public/news.php?&dId=6&aId=3014 Center of Excellence] on July 18, 2007. Upon opening in 2009, the Center of Excellence housed world-class high-performance athletic facilities including strength-training areas, a gymnasium, a climbing wall, ski and snowboard ramps, trampolines, a nutrition center and rehabilitation facilities. Additionally, educational areas for athletes, coaches and clubs such as a computer lab, multimedia rooms for performance analysis and equipment workshops are available. All of the educational resources are shared with the USSA's 400 clubs around the country.\n\n== Making the U.S. Ski Team ==\nInterested young athletes generally begin competing through one of 425 local U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association clubs located in communities around the country, generally at ski and snowboard resorts. Clubs provide introductory education and training, as well as competition programs.\n\nEach U.S. Ski Team sport is also organized at a regional and divisional level, with slight variances by sport. Alpine skiing, for example, is organized in three regions: Eastern, Rocky/Central and Western. Within those regions are divisions including Northern, Eastern, Southern, Central, Rocky Mountain, Intermountain, Far West and Alaska. In some areas, such as New England, there are also state-based organizations.\n\nCompetition programs are held within each region or division leading up to national and international events. From these competitions, athletes earn points and are ranked nationally with the highest ranking athletes earning nominations to join the US national teams, which compete at the [http://www.fis-ski.com/ World Cup] level.\n\nThe USSA is one of the only Olympic sports in America to support a full-time standing national team in every sport. Teams are nominated each spring or summer based on results. Teams for FIS World Championships (held every odd year) and Olympic Winter Games (held every four years) are selected by specific criteria and named for those individual events.\n\n== U.S. Alpine Highlights ==\n\n===Olympic Winter Games===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Since 1974 the team and association have been headquartered in [[Park City, Utah]].<ref>http://www.ussa.org/magnoliaPublic/ussa/en/about/history.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201142750/http://ussa.org/magnoliaPublic/ussa/en/about/history.html |date=2010-12-01 }} USSA history information</ref>\n\nThese athletes represent the best athletes in the country for their respective sports and compete as a team at the national, world and Olympic level.\n\n== History ==\n''*The first U.S. Ski Team was officially named in 1965 for the 1966 season, however the United States participated in skiing at all Olympic Winter Games and sent various athletes to World Championships prior to the '66 season.''\n\n'''1882 - First U.S. Ski Club Founded'''\n\nThe first ski club in the United States was founded in 1882. The [[Nansen Ski Club]] of [[Berlin, New Hampshire]], was founded by [[Norway|Norwegian]] immigrants and named in honor of Norway's legendary Arctic explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen]]. It continues to operate.\n\n'''1905 - National Ski Association Founded'''\n\nThe National Ski Association, the forerunner of the present-day [[United States Ski and Snowboard Association]], was founded on Feb. 21, 1905 in [[Ishpeming, Michigan]]. A meeting was held by the Ishpeming Ski Club in conjunction with a 1904 ski jumping meet in Ishpeming - but the association was not formed at that gathering. Club President [[Carl Tellefsen]] proposed holding a meeting after the 1905 jumping meet \u2013 a national meet - to found a ski association which, among other duties, would oversee jumping tournaments. In 1905, the association was formally organized during a meeting attended by officers from the Ishpeming, Minneapolis, Red Wing, Stillwater and Eau Claire ski clubs. On Feb. 21, 1905, Carl Tellefsen announced the National Ski Association - and said he was its first president.\n\n'''1910 - International Ski Commission Formed'''\n\nSkiing grew throughout the last two decades of the 19th Century in Europe, including [[Russia]]; the first ski club in [[Switzerland]] was formed in 1863 and national associations were created in Russia (1896), [[Czechoslovakia]] (1903), the [[United States]], [[Austria]] and [[Germany]] (all in 1905) and Norway, [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] (1908).\n\nIn 1910, the International Ski Commission was formed to monitor development of skiing globally. On Feb. 2, 1924 in Chamonix, [[France]], while what would come to be recognized as the first [[Winter Olympic Games]] were being held, the commission gave way to the International Ski Federation; 14 member nations were present at the founding; 108 are FIS members today.\n\n'''1924 - Jan. 25-Feb. 4 - Inaugural Olympic Winter Games - Chamonix, France'''\n\nThe first Winter Olympic Games actually were under the banner of International Sports Week, but were renamed the Winter Olympic Games in 1925 after organizers saw how successful they were (and after Norway, which had opposed \"Winter Olympic\" events because of concern Norwegians wouldn't dominate, saw it would be a winter power) supported the concept. Ski events were only Nordic, including cross country, ski jumping (then the premier ski event everywhere) and Nordic combined. Sixteen nations competed.\n\n[[Anders Haugen]], a Norwegian [[immigrant]] to the United States, was listed as fourth in ski jumping because of a calculation error. In 1974, as Norwegians prepared to celebrate the 50th anniversary of those first Winter Games, a recalculation in [[Oslo]] found Haugen was the real bronze medalist and not Thorleif Haug (1894\u20131934). A medal presentation was arranged in Oslo, where a frail Haugen received the bronze medal from the daughter of Thorleif Haug, who had been dead since the Thirties. Haugen's medal remains the only jumping medal won by an American in the Olympics or World Championships. Originally, the IOC did not recognize the medal exchange and kept Haug listed as its 1924 bronze medalist for years before recognizing Haugen as the legitimate medal-winner.<ref>[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Thorleif_Haug/utdypning ''Thorleif Haug'' (Store norske leksikon)]</ref>\n\n'''1925 - First World Nordic Championships held in Johannisbad, Czechoslovakia'''\n\n'''1931 - First World Alpine Championships held in Murren, Switzerland'''\n\nSkiing was still primarily a European sport in the Twenties. Although the United States participated in the Winter Olympics of 1924, '28 and '32 - where there were only Nordic events, there was no US Ski Team. Athletes were selected for the various championships.\n\n'''1932 - Feb. 4-15 - Olympic Winter Games - Lake Placid, New York'''\n\nThe 1932 Summer Games were headed to [[Los Angeles]], but Godfrey Dewey \u2013 whose father had founded the [[Lake Placid Club]] \u2013 out-foxed a half-dozen other candidates (including [[Denver]]; [[Minneapolis]] and [[Duluth, Minnesota]]; [[Yosemite]] and [[Lake Tahoe]], California; and [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]], New York). Then-Gov. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] pledged to build a [[bobsled]] run and Dewey, who had finagled a posting as manager of the 1928 Olympic Ski Team, parlayed those contacts to land the \u201932 Winter Olympics for the small [[Adirondacks]] village. Some 300 athletes from 17 nations competed. Skiing was still a Nordic show; top US skier was another jumper, [[Casper Oimoen]], who finished fifth.\n\n''*** This was the first major international ski event in the United States''\n\n'''1935 - US sends first alpine team to FIS World Championships'''\n\nThe championships returned to Murren, Switzerland, site of the first official alpine championships in 1931. Six men, seven women were on that first official US squad at Worlds.\n\n'''1936 - Feb. 6-16 - Alpine added to Olympic Winter Games - Garmisch-Partenkirchen, [[Germany]]'''\n\nAlpine skiing was introduced with to the Olympics with a single event, the combined (one downhill run and two slalom runs). While Nordic remained an all-male province, alpine was opened to men and women. Germans took gold and silver in both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s alpine combined events; Franz Pfnuer and Christl Cranz were the new champions; Dick Durrance, who grew up in [[Florida]] but spent several years in Germany learning to ski before [[Hitler]] took power, was the runaway best US skier, finishing 10th.\n\nFor the only time, the FIS authorized a World Championships in addition to the Olympics with alpine championship races held in [[Innsbruck]], Austria.\n\n'''1948 - Jan. 30-Feb. 8 - Olympics return with first US alpine medals - St. Moritz, Switzerland'''\n\nThe Olympics (with Germany and [[Japan]] barred from competing) returned after a 12-year hiatus, with American Gretchen Fraser (then of Vancouver, WA, later of Sun Valley, ID) winning the first two US Olympic ski medals \u2013 and they came on the same day, Feb. 5; the combined downhill had been run the previous day and when she won the slalom, it gave her second place in the combined calculation. In addition to the combined, which debuted in 1936, alpine added both elements of combined as individual events, meaning alpine was now equal with Nordic, having three events (slalom, downhill and the combined; however, there were no women's Nordic events until 1952).\n \nFraser led US skiers, collecting the first medals by a US skier - gold in slalom and silver in combined. The US women included a talented young teen \u2013 Andrea Mead, 15, whose parents owned Pico Peak, near Rutland, VT.\n\nAlso of note, Gordy Wren (Steamboat Springs, CO) qualified for all four individual ski teams. He eventually competed only in jumping. \"I was going ragged, bumping into myself, trying to train, ski alpine, cross country and the rest, so I decided to focus on jumping,\" he explained. He finished fifth.\n\n'''1950 - World Championships in USA, Lake Placid, NY (Nordic) and Aspen, CO (alpine)'''\n\nPoor snow in the Adirondacks almost forced cancellation of the Nordic events, but, alerted by 1948 Olympic cross country racer \"Chummy\" Broomhall that there was more than a foot of snow in his hometown of [[Rumford, Maine]], officials agreed to stage opening ceremonies and the jumping events in Lake Placid, then everyone drove to Rumford for the cross country competitions. At one point, Broomhall helped set the race tracks \u2013 no machine-setting equipment in those days, so skiers would ski-in the tracks \u2013 and then went home to change into his racing outfit; traffic at the site meant Broomhall missed his scheduled start time, but officials let him run at the end of the pack.\n\nThe alpine Worlds, organized by racing great Dick Durrance, then general manager at the fledgling [[Aspen Mountain (ski area)|Aspen Ski Area]], included slalom, downhill, and the first appearance of giant slalom. American [[Katy Rodolph]] of Colorado led the USA, finishing fifth in the women's downhill. [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] was established as an alpine destination as a result of the successful World Championships.\n\n'''1960 - Feb. 18-28 - Olympics return to USA - Squaw Valley, CA'''\n\nThe young [[Squaw Valley Ski Resort|Squaw Valley]] resort near [[Lake Tahoe]] in California ushered in a new Olympic era under the direction of Alex Cushing. No bobsled run was built but the skiing was memorable. In cross country, Squaw Valley introduced the initial machine-set tracks; everything had been walked or skied in before Squaw Valley but \u2013 with Al Merrill and Chummy Broomhall setting the tone as chief of competition and chief of course, respectively \u2013 snow machines were used to help groom Nordic courses for the first time.\n\n'''1962 - NSA renamed US Ski Association'''\n\nThe 57-year-old National Ski Association got a new name as the U.S. Ski Association. The renamed organization moved from Denver to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], CO.\n\nAlso, the US Ski Education Foundation, designed to \"Establish, administer and promote educational programs devoted to the development and training of skiers\" and promote ski museums, was founded Oct. 8, 1862 (and chartered June 13, 1964). By enabling donors to receive tax deductions for contributions, it would become the fundraising arm of the US Ski Team, the forerunner of the US Ski and Snowboard Team Foundation.\n\n'''1964 - Jan. 29-Feb. 9 - U.S. alpine men earn first Olympic medals - Innsbruck, Austria'''\n\nThe Olympics came to Austria for the first time in 1964. US men earned their first medals Feb. 8 as [[Billy Kidd]] (Stowe, VT) won silver in slalom and [[Jimmie Heuga]] (Tahoe City, CA) took slalom bronze. Jean Saubert (Hillsborough, OR) was a double medalist, tying for silver in giant slalom and collecting bronze in slalom.\n\n'''1965 - Bob Beattie named U.S. Ski Team alpine head coach'''\n\nOn June 21, 1965, the USSA took the first steps in the formation of a formal US Ski Team by naming its first head alpine coach. At the annual USSA convention on June 21 in Spokane, WA, [[Bob Beattie (skiing)|Bob Beattie]] was named the first full-time US alpine skiing head coach. \"When you think you're going too fast--accelerate!\" he would goad team members. [[Chuck Ferries]], a 1964 Olympian, was named assistant coach, with primary responsibilities as head coach of the women's alpine team. Ferries took leave from his job with Head Ski Co. to coach, and was named full-time women's coach in 1966. No full-time Nordic jumping or skiing coaches were yet designated.\n\n'''1973 - National Training Centers created'''\n\nNational Training Centers were created for both national alpine and Nordic teams. It was opened Oct. 28 in three old, mid-mountain, mining buildings at Park City Ski Area (now Park City Mountain Resort). Former Alpine Director [[Willy Schaeffler]] was the center's director.\n\n'''1974 - U.S. Ski Team moves to Park City, UT'''\n\nIn the summer of 1974 the alpine portion of the US Ski Team relocated from USSA's Denver office to [[Park City, Utah]]. The athletes and coaches began utilizing the Alpine Training Center, a building designed by Willy Schaeffler, that opened in old mining buildings at Park City Ski Area. Administrative offices were set up in the old Mountain Air Grocery on lower Main Street. Eventually, the Ski Team move up the hill to the old Treasure Mountain Inn.\n\n'''1976 - USSA and U.S. Ski Team split'''\n\nIn 1976 the USSA and the US Ski Team agreed to part ways. The USSA continued to control the rules and governance of the sport, as well as organizing travel programs for recreational skiers, while the US Ski Team focused solely on the elite national team.\n\n'''1988 - USSA and U.S. Ski Team rejoin'''\n\nAfter years of operating separately, the USSA and U.S. Ski Team were merged once again in the Summer of 1998 under the direction of [[Thomas Weisel]]. Weisel proposed the creation of a \u2018super-board\u2019 consisting of 15 people representing the leadership of both organizations. USSA CEO Howard Peterson was selected to lead the new  organization and the USSA moved its national offices from Colorado Springs to join the U.S. Ski Team in [[Park City, UT]], establishing its headquarters at its present location on 1500 Kearns Blvd.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Richard L.|title=Capital Instincts: Life as an Entrepreneur, Financier, and Athlete|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0471214175|pages=149-151|edition=1|url=https://www.amazon.com/Capital-Instincts-Entrepreneur-Financier-Athlete/dp/0471214175|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''2007 - Center of Excellence Groundbreaking'''\n\nThe USSA broke ground on the [http://www.usskiteam.com/public/news.php?&dId=6&aId=3014 Center of Excellence] on July 18, 2007. Upon opening in 2009, the Center of Excellence housed world-class high-performance athletic facilities including strength-training areas, a gymnasium, a climbing wall, ski and snowboard ramps, trampolines, a nutrition center and rehabilitation facilities. Additionally, educational areas for athletes, coaches and clubs such as a computer lab, multimedia rooms for performance analysis and equipment workshops are available. All of the educational resources are shared with the USSA's 400 clubs around the country.\n\n== Making the U.S. Ski Team ==\nInterested young athletes generally begin competing through one of 425 local U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association clubs located in communities around the country, generally at ski and snowboard resorts. Clubs provide introductory education and training, as well as competition programs.\n\nEach U.S. Ski Team sport is also organized at a regional and divisional level, with slight variances by sport. Alpine skiing, for example, is organized in three regions: Eastern, Rocky/Central and Western. Within those regions are divisions including Northern, Eastern, Southern, Central, Rocky Mountain, Intermountain, Far West and Alaska. In some areas, such as New England, there are also state-based organizations.\n\nCompetition programs are held within each region or division leading up to national and international events. From these competitions, athletes earn points and are ranked nationally with the highest ranking athletes earning nominations to join the US national teams, which compete at the [http://www.fis-ski.com/ World Cup] level.\n\nThe USSA is one of the only Olympic sports in America to support a full-time standing national team in every sport. Teams are nominated each spring or summer based on results.

As part of the Eastern Algonquian family of tribes, they are related to the abutting [[Lenape]], who occupied territory to the south as far as the Atlantic coast. The Mohicans occupied the upper tidal [[Hudson River Valley]], including the confluence of the Mohawk River (where present-day [[Albany, New York]], developed) and into western New England centered on the upper Housatonic watershed. After 1680, due to conflicts with the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] during the [[Beaver Wars]], many were driven southeastward across the present-day Massachusetts western border and the [[Taconic Mountains]] to [[Berkshire County]] around [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]].\n \nSince the forcible relocation of American Indian populations to reservations in the [[American Frontier|American West]] during the 1830s, most descendants of the Mohicans are located in [[Shawano County, Wisconsin]].  Decades later they eventually formed the federally recognized [[Stockbridge-Munsee Community]] with registered members of the [[Munsee]] people and have a {{convert|22000|acre|km2|adj=on|0}} reservation.\n\nFollowing the disruption of the [[American Revolutionary War]], most of the Mohican descendants first migrated westward to join the [[Iroquois]] [[Oneida people|Oneida]] on their reservation in central New York. The Oneida gave them about 22,000 acres for their use. After more than two decades, in the 1820s and 1830s, the Oneida and the Stockbridge moved again, pressured to relocate to northeastern [[Wisconsin]] under the federal [[Indian Removal]] program.<ref name=EBmohs>[http://p2.www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370993 EB-Mohicans \"Mohican\" (history)], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 2007 {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070624083706/http://p2.www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370993 |date=24 June 2007 }}</ref> A group of Mohicans also migrated to Canada to live with Iroquois Six Nations.\n\nThe tribe identified by the place where they lived: {{lang|mjy|Muh-he-ka-neew}} (or \"people of the continually flowing waters\").<ref>''Stockbridge, Past and Present''; Electa Jones</ref> The word {{lang|mjy|Muh-he-kan}} refers to a great sea or body of water, and the Hudson River reminded them of their place of origin, so they named the Hudson River {{lang|mjy|Mahicanituck}}, or the river where there are people from the continually flowing waters.<ref>\"Mohican Oral Tribal History as recorded by Hendrick Aupaumut\" and printed in ''Stockbridge, Past and Present'' by Electa Jones.</ref> Therefore, they, along with other tribes living along the Hudson River (such as the ''[[Munsee]]'', known by the dialect of Lenape that they spoke, and ''[[Wappinger]]''), were called \"the River Indians\" by the Dutch and English. The Dutch heard and wrote the term for the people of the area variously as: ''Mahigan'', ''Mahikander'', ''Mahinganak'', ''Maikan'' and ''Mawhickon'', among other variants, which the English simplified later to ''Mohican'' or ''Mahican'', in a transliteration to their spelling system. The French, adopting names used by their Indian allies in Canada, knew the Mohicans as the {{lang|fr|Loups}} (or wolves); similarly, they referred to the [[Iroquois]] as the \"Snake People\" (or \"Five Nations\").  Like the Munsee and Wappinger peoples, the Mohicans were related to the [[Lenape people]], who occupied coastal areas from western Long Island to the [[Delaware River]] valley to the south.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, the Mohicans joined other former New York tribes and the Oneida in filing land claims against New York state for what were considered unconstitutional purchases after the Revolutionary War. In 2010, outgoing governor [[David Paterson]] announced a land exchange with the Stockbridge-Munsee that would enable them to build a large casino on {{convert|330|acre}} in [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan County]] in the [[Catskills]], in exchange for dropping their larger claim in [[Madison County, New York|Madison County]]. The deal had many opponents.\n\n==Territory==\nThe Mohicans were living in and around the [[Hudson River]] (or {{lang|mjy|Mahicannituck}}) at the time of their first contact with [[Europe]]ans traders along the river in the 1590s. After 1609 at the time of the Dutch settlement of [[New Netherland]], they also ranged along the eastern [[Mohawk River]] and the [[Hoosic River]]. Most of their communities lay along the upper tidal reaches of the Hudson River and along the watersheds of Kinderhook-Claverack-Taghkanic Creek, the Roeliff Jansen Kill, Catskil Creek, and adjacent areas of the Housatonic Watershed. Mohican territory reached along Hudson River watersheds northeastward to Wood Creek just south of [[Lake Champlain]]. In [[Mohican language|their own language]], the Mohicans identified collectively as the {{lang|mjy|Muhhekunneuw}}, \"people of the great tidal river\".<ref name=sultzman>[http://www.dickshovel.com/Mahican.html Sultzman, Lee. \"Mahican History\"]</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nMohican villages were fairly large. Usually consisting of 20 to 30 mid-sized [[longhouse]]s, they were located on hills and heavily fortified. Their large cornfields were located nearby. Agriculture and gathering of nuts, fruits and roots provided most of their diet, but was supplemented by the men hunting game, and fishing. Mohican villages were governed by hereditary [[sachem]]s advised by a council of clan elders. A general council of sachems met regularly at [[Schodack, New York|Shodac]] (east of present-day Albany) to decide important matters affecting the entire confederacy.<ref name=sultzman/> In his history of the Indians of the Hudson River, [[Edward Manning Ruttenber]] described the clans of the Mohicans as the Bear, the Turkey, the Turtle, and the Wolf, with the Wolf serving as a defensive shield in the north against the Mohawk.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nLike their Munsee-speaking relatives to the south, Mohican villages followed a dispersed settlement pattern, with each community likely dominated by a single lineage or clan. Usually consisting of a small cluster of small and mid-sized [[longhouse]]s, they were located along floodplains. During times of war, they built fortifications in defensive locations (such as along ridges) as places of retreat. Their cornfields were located near to their communities; varieties of squash, beans, sunflowers, and other crops from the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]]. Horticulture and gathering of nuts (hickory, butternuts, black walnuts and acorns), fruits (blueberries, raspberries, juneberries among many others) and roots (groundnuts, wood lilies, arrowroot among others) provided much of their diet. This was supplemented by the men hunting game (turkeys, deer, elk, bears, and moose in the Taconics) and fishing (sturgeon, alewives, shad, eels, lamprey and striped bass). Mohican communities were governed by hereditary [[sachem]]s advised by a council of clan elders. A general council of sachems met regularly at [[Schodack, New York|Schodac]] (east of present-day Albany) to decide important matters affecting the entire group.<ref name=sultzman/> Moravian missionary [[John Heckewelder]] and early anthropologist [[Lewis H. Morgan]] both learned, from Mohican informants, that their matrilineal society was divided into three phratries (Turkey, Turtle and Wolf) and these divided into clans or subclans, including a potentially prominent Bear Clan. This is supported by Mohican signatures on treaties and land deeds (see the works of [[Shirley Dunn]]).\n\n==History==\n===Mohican Confederacy===\nThe Mohicans were a confederacy of five tribes and as many as forty villages.<ref name=sultzman/>\n* ''Mohican proper'', lived in the vicinity of today's [[Albany, New York|Albany]] ({{lang|mjy|Pempotowwuthut-Muhhcanneuw}}, \"the fireplace of the Mahican Nation\") west towards the Mohawk River and to the northwest to Lake Champlain and Lake George\n* {{lang|mjy|Mechkentowoon}}, lived along the west shore of the Hudson River above the Catskill Creek)\n* {{lang|mjy|Wawyachtonoc}} (or {{lang|mjy|Wawayachtonoc}},  \"eddy people\" or \"people of the curving channel\"), lived in [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]] and [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]] eastward to the Housatonic River in [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield County]], Connecticut, main village was ''Weantinock'', additional villages: ''Shecomeco'', ''Wechquadnach'', ''Pamperaug'', ''Bantam'', ''Weataug'', ''Scaticook'')\n* ''Westenhuck'' (from {{lang|mjy|hous atenuc}}, \"on the other side of the mountains\"), the name of a village near [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts|Great Barrington]], Massachusetts.

Iroquois oral tradition, as recorded in the ''[[Jesuit Relations]]'', speaks of a war between the Mohawks and an alliance of the Susquehannock and [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] (sometime between 1580 and 1600). This was perhaps in response to the formation of the League of the Iroquois.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/americanheritage00bran Brandon, William. ''American Heritage Book of Indians'', (Alvin M. Josephy, ed.), American Heritage Pub. Co. 1961, p. 187]</ref>\n\nIn September 1609 Henry Hudson encountered Mohican villages just below present day Albany, with whom he traded goods for furs. Hudson returned to Holland with a cargo of valuable furs which immediately attracted Dutch merchants to the area. The first Dutch fur traders arrived on the Hudson River the following year to trade with the Mohicans. Besides exposing them to European epidemics, the fur trade destabilized the region.<ref name=sultzman/>\n\nIn 1614, the Dutch decided to establish a permanent trading post on [[Castle Island (New York)|Castle Island]], on the site of a previous French post that had been long abandoned; but first they had to arrange a truce to end fighting which had broken out between the Mohicans and Mohawks. Fighting broke out again between the Mohicans and Mohawks in 1617, and with [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] badly damaged by a freshet, the Dutch abandoned the fort. In 1618, having once again negotiated a truce, the Dutch rebuilt Fort Nassau on higher ground.<ref>[http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsAmericas/NorthMohicans.htm \"Mahican Confederacy\", The History Files]</ref> Late that year, Fort Nassau was destroyed by flooding and abandoned for good. In 1624, Captain [[Cornelius Jacobsen May]] sailed the {{lang|nl|Nieuw Nederlandt}} upriver and landed eighteen families of [[Walloons]] on a plain opposite Castle Island. They commenced to construct [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]].\n\nThe Mohicans invited the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] and [[Innu|Montagnais]] to bring their furs to Fort Orange as an alternate to French traders in Quebec. Seeing the Mohicans extended their control over the fur trade, the Mohawk attacked, with initial success. In 1625 or 1626 the Mohicans destroyed the easternmost Iroquois \"castle\". The Mohawks then re-located south of the [[Mohawk River]], closer to Fort Orange. In July 1626 many of the settlers moved to [[New Amsterdam]] because of the conflict. The Mohicans requested help from the Dutch and Commander Daniel Van Krieckebeek set out from the fort with six soldiers. Van Krieckebeek, three soldiers, and twenty-four Mohicans were killed when their party was ambushed by the Mohawk about mile from the fort. The Mohawks withdrew with some body parts of those slain for later consumption as a demonstration of supremacy.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qJ-KAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA115 Parmenter, Jon W., \"Separate Vessels\", ''The Worlds of the Seventeenth-Century Hudson Valley''], (Jaap Jacobs, L.

The Mohawks gained a near-monopoly in the fur trade with the Dutch by prohibiting the nearby Algonquian-speaking tribes to the north or east to trade.\n\n===Stockbridge===\nMany Mohicans settled in the town of [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], where they gradually became known as the \"Stockbridge Indians\". {{lang|mjy|Etow Oh Koam}}, one of their chiefs, accompanied three Mohawk chiefs on a state visit to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and her government in England in 1710.

In the 18th century, many converted to [[Christianity]], while keeping certain traditions of their own.  They fought on the side of the British colonists in the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years' War]]).  During the [[American Revolution]], they sided with the colonists.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Calloway| first1=Colin| title=The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities| date=1995| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-47149-7| pages=[https://archive.org/details/americanrevoluti00call/page/88 88\u2013107]| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/americanrevoluti00call/page/88}}</ref>\n\nIn the eighteenth century, some of the Mohicans developed strong ties with missionaries of the [[Moravian Church]] from [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], who founded a mission at their village of {{lang|mjy|[[Shekomeko]]}} in [[Dutchess County, New York]]. Henry Rauch reached out to two Mohican leaders, {{lang|mjy|Maumauntissekun}}, also known as {{lang|mjy|Shabash}}; and {{lang|mjy|Wassamapah}}, who took him back to Shekomeko. They named him the new religious teacher. Over time, Rauch won listeners, as the Mohicans had suffered much from disease and warfare, which had disrupted their society. Early in 1742, Shabash and two other Mohicans accompanied Rauch to Bethlehem, where he was to be ordained as a deacon. The three Mohicans were baptized on 11 February 1742 in John de Turk's barn nearby at [[Oley, Pennsylvania]]. Shabash was the first Mohican of Shekomeko to adopt the Christian religion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dunn|title=The Mohican World 1680\u20131750|year=2000|pages=228\u2013230}}</ref> The Moravians built a chapel for the Mohican people in 1743. They defended the Mohican against European settlers' exploitation, trying to protect them against land encroachment and abuses of liquor.\n\nOn a 1738 visit to New York, the Mohicans spoke to Governor [[Lewis Morris (governor)|Lewis Morris]] concerning the sale of their land near Shekomeko. The Governor promised they would be paid as soon as the lands were surveyed.  He suggested that for their own security, they should mark off their square mile of land they wished to keep, which the Mohicans never did. In September 1743, still under the Acting-Governor [[George Clarke (governor)|George Clarke]] the land was finally surveyed by New York Assembly agents and divided into lots, a row of which ran through the Indians' reserved land. With some help from the missionaries, on 17 October 1743 and already under the new Royal Governor [[George Clinton (Royal Navy officer)|George Clinton]], Shabash put together a petition of names of people who could attest that the land in which one of the lots was running through was theirs. Despite Shabash's appeals, his persistence, and the missionaries' help, the Mohicans lost the case.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dunn|title=The Mohican World 1680\u20131750|year=2000|pages=232\u2013235}}</ref> The lots were eventually bought up by European-American settlers and the Mohicans were forced out of Shekomeko. Some who opposed the missionaries' work accused them of being secret [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] (who had been outlawed from the colony in 1700) and of working with the Mohicans on the side of the French. The missionaries were summoned more than once before colonial government, but also had supporters. In the late 1740s the colonial government at [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]] expelled the missionaries from New York, in part because of their advocacy of Mohican rights. Settlers soon took over the Mohican land.<ref>[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/town/pineplains/history.html Philip H.

After much debate, they decided that such a war was a private affair between the British and the colonists (known as Rebels, Revolutionaries, Congress-Men, American Whigs, or [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]]), and that they should stay out of it. Mohawk Chief [[Joseph Brant]] feared that the Indians would lose their lands if the Colonists achieved independence. Sir [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|William Johnson]], his son [[Sir John Johnson, 2nd Baronet|John Johnson]] and son-in-law [[Guy Johnson]] and Brant used all their influence to engage the Iroquois to fight for the British cause. The [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], and [[Seneca people|Seneca]] ultimately became allies and provided warriors for the battles in the New York area. The [[Oneida people|Oneida]] and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] sided with the Colonists. The Mohicans, who as Algonquians were not part of the Iroquois Confederacy, sided with the Patriots, serving at the Siege of Boston, and the battles of Saratoga and Monmouth.\n\nIn 1778 they lost fifteen warriors in a British ambush at the Bronx, New York, and later received a commendation from George Washington.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Aupaumut|first1=Hendrick|title=From George Washington to Captain Hendrick Aupaumut, 4 July 1779|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-21-02-0283|publisher=Archives.gov}}</ref>\n\nLater, the citizens of the new United States forced many Native Americans off their land and westward. In the 1780s, groups of Stockbridge Indians moved from Massachusetts to a new location among the [[Oneida people]] in western New York, who were granted a {{convert|300000|acre|adj=on}} reservation for their service to the Patriots, out of their former territory of {{convert|6000000|acre}}. They called their settlement New Stockbridge. Some individuals and families, mostly people who were old or those with special ties to the area, remained behind at Stockbridge.\n\nThe central figures of Mohican society, including the chief sachem, Joseph Quanaukaunt, and his counselors and relatives, were part of the move to New Stockbridge. At the new town, the Stockbridge emigrants controlled their own affairs and combined traditional ways with the new as they chose. After learning from the Christian missionaries, the Stockbridge Indians were experienced in English ways. At [[Stockbridge, New York|New Stockbridge]] they replicated their former town. While continuing as Christians, they retained their language and Mohican cultural traditions. In general, their evolving Mohican identity was still rooted in traditions of the past.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dunn|first=Shirley|title=The Mohican World 1680\u20131750|year=2000|publisher=Purple Mountain Press, Ltd.|location=Fleischmanns, New York|pages=213}}</ref>\n\n==Removal to Wisconsin==\nIn the 1820s and 1830s, most of the Stockbridge Indians moved to [[Shawano County, Wisconsin]], where they were promised land by the US government under the policy of [[Indian removal]]. In Wisconsin, they settled on [[Indian reservation|reservation]]s with the [[Lenape]] (called Munsee after one of their major dialects), who were also speakers of one of the Algonquian languages.  Together, the two formed a band and are federally recognized as the [[Stockbridge-Munsee Community]].\n\nThe now extinct [[Mohican language]] belonged to the [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Eastern Algonquian]] branch of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] family. It was an Algonquian N-dialect, as were [[Massachusett]] and [[Wampanoag language|Wampanoag]]. In many ways, it was similar to one of the L-dialects, like that of the [[Lenape]], and could be considered one.\n\nTheir 22,000-acre reservation is known as that of the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians and is located near the town of [[Bowler, Wisconsin|Bowler]]. Since the late twentieth century, they have developed the North Star Mohican Resort and Casino on their reservation, which has successfully generated funds for tribal welfare and economic development.<ref name=\"Toensing\"/>\n\n==Land claims==\nIn the late twentieth century, the Stockbridge-Munsee were among tribes filing land claims against New York, which had been ruled to have unconstitutionally acquired land from Indians without Senate ratification. The Stockbridge-Munsee filed a land claim against New York state for {{convert|23000|acre}} in Madison County, the location of its former property. In 2011, outgoing governor [[David Paterson]] announced having reached a deal with the tribe. They would be given nearly {{convert|2|acre}} in Madison County and give up their larger claim in exchange for the state's giving them 330 acres of land in [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan County]] in the [[Catskill Mountains]], where the government was trying to encourage economic development. The federal government had agreed to take the land in trust, making it eligible for development as a gaming casino, and the state would allow gaming, an increasingly important source of revenue for American Indians. Race track and casinos, private interests and other tribes opposed the deal.<ref name=\"Toensing\">[https://archive.is/20130126040651/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2011/01/26/seneca-nation-cries-foul-over-n-y-agreement-to-give-casino-to-wisc-tribe-12651 Gale Courey Toensing, \"Seneca Upset Over N.Y.

His description includes some cultural aspects of the [[Mohegan]], a different Algonquian tribe that lived in eastern [[Connecticut]]. Cooper set his novel in the Hudson Valley, Mohican land, but used some Mohegan names for his characters, such as [[Uncas]].\n\nThe novel has been adapted for the cinema more than a dozen times, the first time in 1920.

As part of the Eastern Algonquian family of tribes, they are related to the abutting [[Lenape]], who occupied territory to the south as far as the Atlantic coast. The Mohicans occupied the upper tidal [[Hudson River Valley]], including the confluence of the Mohawk River (where present-day [[Albany, New York]], developed) and into western New England centered on the upper Housatonic watershed. After 1680, due to conflicts with the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] during the [[Beaver Wars]], many were driven southeastward across the present-day Massachusetts western border and the [[Taconic Mountains]] to [[Berkshire County]] around [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]].\n \nSince the forcible relocation of American Indian populations to reservations in the [[American Frontier|American West]] during the 1830s, most descendants of the Mohicans are located in [[Shawano County, Wisconsin]].  Decades later they eventually formed the federally recognized [[Stockbridge-Munsee Community]] with registered members of the [[Munsee]] people and have a {{convert|22000|acre|km2|adj=on|0}} reservation.\n\nFollowing the disruption of the [[American Revolutionary War]], most of the Mohican descendants first migrated westward to join the [[Iroquois]] [[Oneida people|Oneida]] on their reservation in central New York. The Oneida gave them about 22,000 acres for their use. After more than two decades, in the 1820s and 1830s, the Oneida and the Stockbridge moved again, pressured to relocate to northeastern [[Wisconsin]] under the federal [[Indian Removal]] program.<ref name=EBmohs>[http://p2.www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370993 EB-Mohicans \"Mohican\" (history)], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 2007 {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070624083706/http://p2.www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370993 |date=24 June 2007 }}</ref> A group of Mohicans also migrated to Canada to live with Iroquois Six Nations.\n\nThe tribe identified by the place where they lived: {{lang|mjy|Muh-he-ka-neew}} (or \"people of the continually flowing waters\").<ref>''Stockbridge, Past and Present''; Electa Jones</ref> The word {{lang|mjy|Muh-he-kan}} refers to a great sea or body of water, and the Hudson River reminded them of their place of origin, so they named the Hudson River {{lang|mjy|Mahicanituck}}, or the river where there are people from the continually flowing waters.<ref>\"Mohican Oral Tribal History as recorded by Hendrick Aupaumut\" and printed in ''Stockbridge, Past and Present'' by Electa Jones.</ref> Therefore, they, along with other tribes living along the Hudson River (such as the ''[[Munsee]]'', known by the dialect of Lenape that they spoke, and ''[[Wappinger]]''), were called \"the River Indians\" by the Dutch and English. The Dutch heard and wrote the term for the people of the area variously as: ''Mahigan'', ''Mahikander'', ''Mahinganak'', ''Maikan'' and ''Mawhickon'', among other variants, which the English simplified later to ''Mohican'' or ''Mahican'', in a transliteration to their spelling system. The French, adopting names used by their Indian allies in Canada, knew the Mohicans as the {{lang|fr|Loups}} (or wolves); similarly, they referred to the [[Iroquois]] as the \"Snake People\" (or \"Five Nations\").  Like the Munsee and Wappinger peoples, the Mohicans were related to the [[Lenape people]], who occupied coastal areas from western Long Island to the [[Delaware River]] valley to the south.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, the Mohicans joined other former New York tribes and the Oneida in filing land claims against New York state for what were considered unconstitutional purchases after the Revolutionary War. In 2010, outgoing governor [[David Paterson]] announced a land exchange with the Stockbridge-Munsee that would enable them to build a large casino on {{convert|330|acre}} in [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan County]] in the [[Catskills]], in exchange for dropping their larger claim in [[Madison County, New York|Madison County]]. The deal had many opponents.\n\n==Territory==\nThe Mohicans were living in and around the [[Hudson River]] (or {{lang|mjy|Mahicannituck}}) at the time of their first contact with [[Europe]]ans traders along the river in the 1590s. After 1609 at the time of the Dutch settlement of [[New Netherland]], they also ranged along the eastern [[Mohawk River]] and the [[Hoosic River]]. Most of their communities lay along the upper tidal reaches of the Hudson River and along the watersheds of Kinderhook-Claverack-Taghkanic Creek, the Roeliff Jansen Kill, Catskil Creek, and adjacent areas of the Housatonic Watershed. Mohican territory reached along Hudson River watersheds northeastward to Wood Creek just south of [[Lake Champlain]]. In [[Mohican language|their own language]], the Mohicans identified collectively as the {{lang|mjy|Muhhekunneuw}}, \"people of the great tidal river\".<ref name=sultzman>[http://www.dickshovel.com/Mahican.html Sultzman, Lee. \"Mahican History\"]</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nMohican villages were fairly large. Usually consisting of 20 to 30 mid-sized [[longhouse]]s, they were located on hills and heavily fortified. Their large cornfields were located nearby. Agriculture and gathering of nuts, fruits and roots provided most of their diet, but was supplemented by the men hunting game, and fishing. Mohican villages were governed by hereditary [[sachem]]s advised by a council of clan elders. A general council of sachems met regularly at [[Schodack, New York|Shodac]] (east of present-day Albany) to decide important matters affecting the entire confederacy.<ref name=sultzman/> In his history of the Indians of the Hudson River, [[Edward Manning Ruttenber]] described the clans of the Mohicans as the Bear, the Turkey, the Turtle, and the Wolf, with the Wolf serving as a defensive shield in the north against the Mohawk.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nLike their Munsee-speaking relatives to the south, Mohican villages followed a dispersed settlement pattern, with each community likely dominated by a single lineage or clan. Usually consisting of a small cluster of small and mid-sized [[longhouse]]s, they were located along floodplains. During times of war, they built fortifications in defensive locations (such as along ridges) as places of retreat. Their cornfields were located near to their communities; varieties of squash, beans, sunflowers, and other crops from the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]]. Horticulture and gathering of nuts (hickory, butternuts, black walnuts and acorns), fruits (blueberries, raspberries, juneberries among many others) and roots (groundnuts, wood lilies, arrowroot among others) provided much of their diet. This was supplemented by the men hunting game (turkeys, deer, elk, bears, and moose in the Taconics) and fishing (sturgeon, alewives, shad, eels, lamprey and striped bass). Mohican communities were governed by hereditary [[sachem]]s advised by a council of clan elders.

Iroquois oral tradition, as recorded in the ''[[Jesuit Relations]]'', speaks of a war between the Mohawks and an alliance of the Susquehannock and [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] (sometime between 1580 and 1600). This was perhaps in response to the formation of the League of the Iroquois.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/americanheritage00bran Brandon, William. ''American Heritage Book of Indians'', (Alvin M.

Hudson returned to Holland with a cargo of valuable furs which immediately attracted Dutch merchants to the area. The first Dutch fur traders arrived on the Hudson River the following year to trade with the Mohicans. Besides exposing them to European epidemics, the fur trade destabilized the region.<ref name=sultzman/>\n\nIn 1614, the Dutch decided to establish a permanent trading post on [[Castle Island (New York)|Castle Island]], on the site of a previous French post that had been long abandoned; but first they had to arrange a truce to end fighting which had broken out between the Mohicans and Mohawks. Fighting broke out again between the Mohicans and Mohawks in 1617, and with [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] badly damaged by a freshet, the Dutch abandoned the fort. In 1618, having once again negotiated a truce, the Dutch rebuilt Fort Nassau on higher ground.<ref>[http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsAmericas/NorthMohicans.htm \"Mahican Confederacy\", The History Files]</ref> Late that year, Fort Nassau was destroyed by flooding and abandoned for good. In 1624, Captain [[Cornelius Jacobsen May]] sailed the {{lang|nl|Nieuw Nederlandt}} upriver and landed eighteen families of [[Walloons]] on a plain opposite Castle Island. They commenced to construct [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]].\n\nThe Mohicans invited the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] and [[Innu|Montagnais]] to bring their furs to Fort Orange as an alternate to French traders in Quebec. Seeing the Mohicans extended their control over the fur trade, the Mohawk attacked, with initial success. In 1625 or 1626 the Mohicans destroyed the easternmost Iroquois \"castle\". The Mohawks then re-located south of the [[Mohawk River]], closer to Fort Orange. In July 1626 many of the settlers moved to [[New Amsterdam]] because of the conflict. The Mohicans requested help from the Dutch and Commander Daniel Van Krieckebeek set out from the fort with six soldiers. Van Krieckebeek, three soldiers, and twenty-four Mohicans were killed when their party was ambushed by the Mohawk about mile from the fort.

In the 18th century, many converted to [[Christianity]], while keeping certain traditions of their own.  They fought on the side of the British colonists in the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years' War]]).  During the [[American Revolution]], they sided with the colonists.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Calloway| first1=Colin| title=The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities| date=1995| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-47149-7| pages=[https://archive.org/details/americanrevoluti00call/page/88 88\u2013107]| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/americanrevoluti00call/page/88}}</ref>\n\nIn the eighteenth century, some of the Mohicans developed strong ties with missionaries of the [[Moravian Church]] from [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], who founded a mission at their village of {{lang|mjy|[[Shekomeko]]}} in [[Dutchess County, New York]]. Henry Rauch reached out to two Mohican leaders, {{lang|mjy|Maumauntissekun}}, also known as {{lang|mjy|Shabash}}; and {{lang|mjy|Wassamapah}}, who took him back to Shekomeko. They named him the new religious teacher. Over time, Rauch won listeners, as the Mohicans had suffered much from disease and warfare, which had disrupted their society. Early in 1742, Shabash and two other Mohicans accompanied Rauch to Bethlehem, where he was to be ordained as a deacon. The three Mohicans were baptized on 11 February 1742 in John de Turk's barn nearby at [[Oley, Pennsylvania]]. Shabash was the first Mohican of Shekomeko to adopt the Christian religion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dunn|title=The Mohican World 1680\u20131750|year=2000|pages=228\u2013230}}</ref> The Moravians built a chapel for the Mohican people in 1743. They defended the Mohican against European settlers' exploitation, trying to protect them against land encroachment and abuses of liquor.\n\nOn a 1738 visit to New York, the Mohicans spoke to Governor [[Lewis Morris (governor)|Lewis Morris]] concerning the sale of their land near Shekomeko. The Governor promised they would be paid as soon as the lands were surveyed.  He suggested that for their own security, they should mark off their square mile of land they wished to keep, which the Mohicans never did. In September 1743, still under the Acting-Governor [[George Clarke (governor)|George Clarke]] the land was finally surveyed by New York Assembly agents and divided into lots, a row of which ran through the Indians' reserved land. With some help from the missionaries, on 17 October 1743 and already under the new Royal Governor [[George Clinton (Royal Navy officer)|George Clinton]], Shabash put together a petition of names of people who could attest that the land in which one of the lots was running through was theirs. Despite Shabash's appeals, his persistence, and the missionaries' help, the Mohicans lost the case.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dunn|title=The Mohican World 1680\u20131750|year=2000|pages=232\u2013235}}</ref> The lots were eventually bought up by European-American settlers and the Mohicans were forced out of Shekomeko. Some who opposed the missionaries' work accused them of being secret [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] (who had been outlawed from the colony in 1700) and of working with the Mohicans on the side of the French. The missionaries were summoned more than once before colonial government, but also had supporters. In the late 1740s the colonial government at [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]] expelled the missionaries from New York, in part because of their advocacy of Mohican rights. Settlers soon took over the Mohican land.<ref>[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/town/pineplains/history.html Philip H.

After much debate, they decided that such a war was a private affair between the British and the colonists (known as Rebels, Revolutionaries, Congress-Men, American Whigs, or [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]]), and that they should stay out of it. Mohawk Chief [[Joseph Brant]] feared that the Indians would lose their lands if the Colonists achieved independence. Sir [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|William Johnson]], his son [[Sir John Johnson, 2nd Baronet|John Johnson]] and son-in-law [[Guy Johnson]] and Brant used all their influence to engage the Iroquois to fight for the British cause. The [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], and [[Seneca people|Seneca]] ultimately became allies and provided warriors for the battles in the New York area. The [[Oneida people|Oneida]] and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] sided with the Colonists. The Mohicans, who as Algonquians were not part of the Iroquois Confederacy, sided with the Patriots, serving at the Siege of Boston, and the battles of Saratoga and Monmouth.\n\nIn 1778 they lost fifteen warriors in a British ambush at the Bronx, New York, and later received a commendation from George Washington.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Aupaumut|first1=Hendrick|title=From George Washington to Captain Hendrick Aupaumut, 4 July 1779|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-21-02-0283|publisher=Archives.gov}}</ref>\n\nLater, the citizens of the new United States forced many Native Americans off their land and westward. In the 1780s, groups of Stockbridge Indians moved from Massachusetts to a new location among the [[Oneida people]] in western New York, who were granted a {{convert|300000|acre|adj=on}} reservation for their service to the Patriots, out of their former territory of {{convert|6000000|acre}}. They called their settlement New Stockbridge. Some individuals and families, mostly people who were old or those with special ties to the area, remained behind at Stockbridge.\n\nThe central figures of Mohican society, including the chief sachem, Joseph Quanaukaunt, and his counselors and relatives, were part of the move to New Stockbridge. At the new town, the Stockbridge emigrants controlled their own affairs and combined traditional ways with the new as they chose. After learning from the Christian missionaries, the Stockbridge Indians were experienced in English ways. At [[Stockbridge, New York|New Stockbridge]] they replicated their former town. While continuing as Christians, they retained their language and Mohican cultural traditions. In general, their evolving Mohican identity was still rooted in traditions of the past.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dunn|first=Shirley|title=The Mohican World 1680\u20131750|year=2000|publisher=Purple Mountain Press, Ltd.|location=Fleischmanns, New York|pages=213}}</ref>\n\n==Removal to Wisconsin==\nIn the 1820s and 1830s, most of the Stockbridge Indians moved to [[Shawano County, Wisconsin]], where they were promised land by the US government under the policy of [[Indian removal]]. In Wisconsin, they settled on [[Indian reservation|reservation]]s with the [[Lenape]] (called Munsee after one of their major dialects), who were also speakers of one of the Algonquian languages.  Together, the two formed a band and are federally recognized as the [[Stockbridge-Munsee Community]].\n\nThe now extinct [[Mohican language]] belonged to the [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Eastern Algonquian]] branch of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] family. It was an Algonquian N-dialect, as were [[Massachusett]] and [[Wampanoag language|Wampanoag]]. In many ways, it was similar to one of the L-dialects, like that of the [[Lenape]], and could be considered one.\n\nTheir 22,000-acre reservation is known as that of the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians and is located near the town of [[Bowler, Wisconsin|Bowler]]. Since the late twentieth century, they have developed the North Star Mohican Resort and Casino on their reservation, which has successfully generated funds for tribal welfare and economic development.<ref name=\"Toensing\"/>\n\n==Land claims==\nIn the late twentieth century, the Stockbridge-Munsee were among tribes filing land claims against New York, which had been ruled to have unconstitutionally acquired land from Indians without Senate ratification. The Stockbridge-Munsee filed a land claim against New York state for {{convert|23000|acre}} in Madison County, the location of its former property. In 2011, outgoing governor [[David Paterson]] announced having reached a deal with the tribe. They would be given nearly {{convert|2|acre}} in Madison County and give up their larger claim in exchange for the state's giving them 330 acres of land in [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan County]] in the [[Catskill Mountains]], where the government was trying to encourage economic development. The federal government had agreed to take the land in trust, making it eligible for development as a gaming casino, and the state would allow gaming, an increasingly important source of revenue for American Indians. Race track and casinos, private interests and other tribes opposed the deal.<ref name=\"Toensing\">[https://archive.is/20130126040651/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2011/01/26/seneca-nation-cries-foul-over-n-y-agreement-to-give-casino-to-wisc-tribe-12651 Gale Courey Toensing, \"Seneca Upset Over N.Y.

His description includes some cultural aspects of the [[Mohegan]], a different Algonquian tribe that lived in eastern [[Connecticut]]. Cooper set his novel in the Hudson Valley, Mohican land, but used some Mohegan names for his characters, such as [[Uncas]].\n\nThe novel has been adapted for the cinema more than a dozen times, the first time in 1920.

The exact opposite of this option is the WATNA (worst alternative to a negotiated agreement). The BATNA could include diverse situations, such as suspension of negotiations, transition to another negotiating partner, appeal to the court's ruling, the execution of strikes, and the formation of other forms of alliances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dic.mk.co.kr/cp/pop/desc.php?from=B&to=C&page=0&so=all|title=::\uc99d\uad8c\uc6a9\uc5b4\uc0ac\uc804::|website=dic.mk.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-05-09}}</ref> BATNA is the key focus and the driving force behind a successful negotiator.  A party should generally not accept a worse resolution than its BATNA.  Care should be taken, however, to ensure that deals are accurately valued, taking into account all considerations, such as relationship value, [[time value of money]] and the likelihood that the other party will live up to their side of the bargain. These other considerations are often difficult to value, since they are frequently based on uncertain or qualitative considerations, rather than easily measurable and quantifiable factors.\n\nOftentimes, it is even more difficult to determine the BATNA of the other party. However, the information is crucial as the BATNA determines the other side\u2019s negotiation power. Sometimes, conclusions can be drawn by determining his/her main interests and the negotiation itself can be used to verify or falsify the assumptions. If, for example, it is assumed that a very early delivery date is of key importance to the negotiating partner, deliberately setting a later delivery date can be proposed. If this late delivery date is decidedly rejected, the desired delivery date is likely to be of great importance.<ref>''Jung/Krebs'', p. 42.</ref>\n\n== BATNA based tactics ==\nBecause of the importance of the BATNA for the negotiation success, several tactics focus on weakening the opponent\u2019s BATNA. This may be achieved e.g. by striving for exclusive negotiations, delaying or accelerating the ongoing negotiations or limiting the negotiation partner to technical systems. If a negotiator is faced with such tactics it is his/her task to examine the possible consequences for the own BATNA and to prevent or counteract any deterioration of the own party\u2019s BATNA.<ref>''Jung/Krebs'', p. 143.</ref>\n\n== BATNA and the order of negotiations ==\nThe BATNA can also influence the order in which negotiations are taken up with potential contracting partners. Favourable is a sequential approach. Here one starts negotiations with the less favoured partners and proceed negotiations with the preferred option afterwards. In this way there is the BATNA of a contract with the less favoured partner.<ref>''Jung/Krebs'', p. 44.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe BATNA is often seen by negotiators not as a safety net, but rather as a point of leverage in negotiations. Although a negotiator's alternative options should, in theory, be straightforward to evaluate, the effort to understand which alternative represents a party's BATNA is often not invested. Options need to be actual and actionable to be of value,<ref>[https://www.negotiations.com/articles/best-alternative/ Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{Third-party-inline|date=July 2013}} however, without the investment of time, options will frequently be included that fail on one of these criteria.<ref>[https://www.yarooms.com/blog/batnaman-wins Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement | YArooms]</ref> {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Most managers overestimate their BATNA whilst simultaneously investing too little time into researching their real options.{{Third-party-inline|date=February 2015}} This can result in poor or faulty decision making and negotiating.

If a negotiator is faced with such tactics it is his/her task to examine the possible consequences for the own BATNA and to prevent or counteract any deterioration of the own partys\u2019 BATNA.<ref>''Jung/Krebs'', p. 143.</ref>\n\n== BATNA and the order of negotiations ==\nThe BATNA can also influence the order in which negotiations are taken up with potential contracting partners. Favourable is a sequential approach. Here one starts negotiations with the less favoured partners and proceed negotiations with the preferred option afterwards. In this way there is the BATNA of a contract with the less favoured partner.<ref>''Jung/Krebs'', p. 44.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe BATNA is often seen by negotiators not as a safety net, but rather as a point of leverage in negotiations. Although a negotiator's alternative options should, in theory, be straightforward to evaluate, the effort to understand which alternative represents a party's BATNA is often not invested. Options need to be actual and actionable to be of value,<ref>[https://www.negotiations.com/articles/best-alternative/ Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{Third-party-inline|date=July 2013}} however, without the investment of time, options will frequently be included that fail on one of these criteria.<ref>[https://www.yarooms.com/blog/batnaman-wins Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement | YArooms]</ref> {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Most managers overestimate their BATNA whilst simultaneously investing too little time into researching their real options.{{Third-party-inline|date=February 2015}} This can result in poor or faulty decision making and negotiating.

Dylan recorded the song in September 1974, but as with some other songs from ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'', re-recorded it in December 1974. Between the recordings, he often reworked the lyrics. A live version of the song was released on Dylan's 1976 album ''[[Hard Rain (Bob Dylan album)|Hard Rain]]'', and all of the studio outtakes from the September sessions were released on the deluxe edition of ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks]]'' in 2018.\n\n== Background and recording ==\nThe song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year and a separation from Sara Lowndes, who he had married in 1965.

He also founded the [[Yuan dynasty]] in China as a [[conquest dynasty]] in 1271, and ruled as the first Yuan emperor until his death in 1294.\n\nKublai was the fourth son of [[Tolui]] (his second son with [[Sorghaghtani Beki]]) and a grandson of [[Genghis Khan]]. He succeeded his older brother [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]] as Khagan in 1260, but had to defeat his younger brother [[Ariq B\u00f6ke]] in the [[Toluid Civil War]] lasting until 1264.

By 1279, the [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty]] was completed and Kublai became the first non-Han emperor to conquer all of China.\n\nThe imperial portrait of Kublai was part of an album of the portraits of Yuan emperors and empresses, now in the collection of the [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei. White, the color of the royal costume of Kublai, was the imperial color of the Yuan dynasty.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Yuan Julian|title=&quot;Legitimation Discourse and the Theory of the Five Elements in Imperial China.&quot; Journal of Song-Yuan Studies 44 (2014): 325\u2013364.|journal=Journal of Song-Yuan Studies|url=https://www.academia.edu/23276848|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nKublai Khan was the fourth son of [[Tolui]], and his second son with [[Sorghaghtani Beki]]. As his grandfather [[Genghis Khan]] advised, Sorghaghtani chose a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Tangut people|Tangut]] woman as her son's nurse, whom Kublai later honored highly. On his way home after the [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia]], Genghis Khan performed a ceremony on his grandsons M\u00f6ngke and Kublai after their first hunt in 1224 near the [[Ili River]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Weatherford |title=The Secret History of the Mongol Queens |page=135}}</ref> Kublai was nine years old and with his eldest brother killed a rabbit and an antelope. After his grandfather smeared fat from killed animals onto Kublai's middle finger in accordance with a Mongol tradition, he said \"The words of this boy [[Kublai]] are full of wisdom, heed them well \u2013 heed them all of you.\" The elderly Khagan (Mongol emperor) Genghis Khan would die three years after this event in 1227, when Kublai was 12. Kublai's father Tolui would serve as regent for two years until Genghis' successor, Kublai's third uncle [[Ogedei Khan|Ogedei]], was enthroned as Khagan in 1229.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAfter the [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty]], in 1236, Ogedei gave [[Hebei]] (attached with 80,000 households) to the family of Tolui, who died in 1232. Kublai received an estate of his own, which included 10,000 households. Because he was inexperienced, Kublai allowed local officials free rein. Corruption amongst his officials and aggressive taxation caused large numbers of Chinese peasants to flee, which led to a decline in tax revenues. Kublai quickly came to his [[appanage]] in Hebei and ordered reforms. Sorghaghtani sent new officials to help him and tax laws were revised. Thanks to those efforts, many of the people who fled returned.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe most prominent, and arguably most influential, component of Kublai Khan's early life was his study and strong attraction to contemporary [[Chinese culture]]. Kublai invited Haiyun, the leading Buddhist monk in North China, to his [[Orda (organization)|ordo]] in Mongolia. When he met Haiyun in Karakorum in 1242, Kublai asked him about the philosophy of Buddhism. Haiyun named Kublai's son, who was born in 1243, [[Zhenjin]] (Chinese: ''True Gold'').<ref name=\"Man2007p37\">{{harvnb|Man|2007|p=37}}</ref> Haiyun also introduced Kublai to the formerly [[Taoism|Daoist]], and at the time Buddhist monk, Liu Bingzhong. Liu was a painter, calligrapher, poet, and mathematician, and he became Kublai's advisor when Haiyun returned to his temple in modern [[Beijing]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen G. |last=Haw |title=Marco Polo's China |page=33}}</ref> Kublai soon added the [[Shanxi]] scholar Zhao Bi to his entourage. Kublai employed people of other nationalities as well, for he was keen to balance local and imperial interests, Mongol and [[Turkic peoples|Turk]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=\u1e0e\u1e24WTY|title=Kublai Khan: Mongol Warrior, Horseman, Hunter and Powerful Emperor|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/kublai-khan-mongol-warrior-horseman-hunter-and-powerful-emperor-006033|website=Ancient Origins|accessdate=12 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Victory in North China==\n[[File:Qubilai Setsen Khaan.JPG|thumb|Portrait of young Kublai by [[Araniko|Anige]], a Nepali artist in Kublai's court]]\nIn 1251, Kublai's eldest brother [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]] became Khan of the Mongol Empire, and Khwarizmian [[Mahmud Yalavach]] and Kublai were sent to China. Kublai received the [[viceroy]]alty over North China and moved his ordo to central [[Inner Mongolia]]. During his years as viceroy, Kublai managed his territory well, boosted the agricultural output of [[Henan]], and increased social welfare spendings after receiving [[Xi'an]]. These acts received great acclaim from the Chinese warlords and were essential to the building of the Yuan Dynasty. In 1252, Kublai criticized Mahmud Yalavach, who was never highly valued by his Chinese associates, over his cavalier execution of suspects during a judicial review, and Zhao Bi attacked him for his presumptuous attitude toward the throne. M\u00f6ngke dismissed Mahmud Yalavach, which met with resistance from Chinese Confucian-trained officials.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Franke |editor1-first=Herbert |editor2-last=Twitchett |editor2-first=Denis C. |title=The Cambridge History of China: Volume 6, Alien Regimes and Border States, 907\u20131368 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iN9Tdfdap5MC |year=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-24331-5 |page=381}}</ref>\n\nIn 1253, Kublai was ordered to attack [[Yunnan]] and he asked the [[Dali Kingdom]] to submit. The ruling Gao family resisted and killed Mongol [[diplomacy|envoys]]. The Mongols divided their forces into three. One wing rode eastward into the [[Sichuan]] basin. The second column under Subutai's son Uryankhadai took a difficult route into the mountains of western Sichuan.<ref name=\"Man2007p79\">{{harvnb|Man|2007|p=79}}</ref> Kublai went south over the grasslands and met up with the first column. While Uryankhadai travelled along the lakeside from the north, Kublai took the capital city of [[Dali City|Dali]] and spared the residents despite the slaying of his ambassadors. The Dali King Duan Xingzhi ([[w:zh:\u6bb5\u8208\u667a|\u6bb5\u8208\u667a]]) himself defected to the Mongols, who used his troops to conquer the rest of Yunnan. Duan Xingzhi, the last king of Dali, was appointed by [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] as the first ''[[tusi]]'' or local ruler; Duan accepted the stationing of a pacification commissioner there.<ref name=\"Atwood613\">{{harvnb|Atwood|2004|p=613}}</ref> After Kublai's departure, unrest broke out among certain factions.

However, his domestic policy included some aspects of the old Mongol living traditions, and as his reign continued, these traditions would clash increasingly frequently with traditional Chinese economic and social culture. Kublai decreed that partner merchants of the Mongols should be subject to taxes in 1263 and set up the Office of Market Taxes to supervise them in 1268. After the Mongol conquest of the Song, the merchants expanded their operations to the [[South China Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. In 1286, maritime trade was put under the Office of Market Taxes.

To guard against devaluation, the currency was convertible with silver and gold, and the government accepted tax payments in paper currency. In 1273, Kublai issued a new series of state sponsored bills to finance his conquest of the Song, although eventually a lack of fiscal discipline and inflation turned this move into an economic disaster. It was required to pay only in the form of paper money. To ensure its use, Kublai's government confiscated gold and silver from private citizens and foreign merchants, but traders received government-issued notes in exchange. Kublai Khan is considered to be the first [[fiat money]] maker.

The fleet was hastily assembled and ill-equipped to cope with maritime conditions. In November, they sailed into the treacherous waters that separate Korea and Japan by 110 miles.

The Mongols fought as a united force, not as individuals, and bombarded the samurai with exploding missiles and showered them with arrows. Eventually, the remaining Japanese withdrew from the coastal zone inland to a fortress. The Mongol forces did not chase the fleeing Japanese into an area about which they lacked reliable intelligence.  In a number of individual skirmishes, known collectively as the K\u014dan Campaign (\u5f18\u5b89\u306e\u5f79) or the \"Second Battle of Hakata Bay\", the Mongol forces were driven back to their ships by the Samurai. The Japanese army was heavily outnumbered, but had fortified the coastal line with two-meter high walls, and was easily able to repulse the Mongolian forces that were launched against it.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[File:Takezaki suenaga ekotoba3.jpg|thumb|350px|Japanese [[samurai]] boarding Yuan ships in 1281.]]\n\n[[Maritime archaeology|Maritime archaeologist]] Kenzo Hayashida led the investigation that discovered the wreckage of the second invasion fleet off the western coast of [[Takashima District, Shiga]]. His team's findings strongly indicate that Kublai rushed to invade Japan and attempted to construct his enormous fleet in one year, a task that should have taken up to five years. This forced the Chinese to use any available ships, including river boats. Most importantly, the Chinese, under Kublai's control, built many ships quickly in order to contribute to the fleets in both of the invasions. Hayashida theorizes that, had Kublai used standard, well-constructed ocean-going ships with curved keels to prevent capsizing, his navy might have survived the journey to and from Japan and might have conquered it as intended. In October 2011, a wreck, possibly one of Kublai's invasion craft, was found off the coast of [[Nagasaki]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-10-25/asia/world_asia_japan-archaeology-shipwreck_1_fleet-ship-invasion?_s=PM:ASIA |title=Shipwreck may be part of Kublai Khan's lost fleet |date=October 25, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027212311/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-10-25/asia/world_asia_japan-archaeology-shipwreck_1_fleet-ship-invasion?_s=PM:ASIA |archivedate=October 27, 2011 }}</ref> David Nicolle wrote in ''The Mongol Warlords'', \"Huge losses had also been suffered in terms of casualties and sheer expense, while the myth of Mongol invincibility had been shattered throughout eastern Asia.\" He also wrote that Kublai was determined to mount a third invasion, despite the horrendous cost to the economy and to his and Mongol prestige of the first two defeats, and only his death and the unanimous agreement of his advisers not to invade prevented a third attempt.<ref>Nicolle, David ''The Mongol Warlords''</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:MokoShuraiE-Kotoba I.jpg|Mongol soldiers, second version\nFile:MokoShuraiE-Kotoba III.jpg|Mongol ships, second version\nFile:YuanJunk(14thcentury).jpg|Painting of a 14th-century prized Yuan dynasty [[Junk (ship)|junk]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Invasions of Vietnam===\n{{main|Mongol invasions of Vietnam}}\nKublai Khan invaded [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] (now Vietnam) three times, each repelled by the ruling [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]].

Kublai sent another envoy to the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to demand that the Tr\u1ea7n king surrender his land and his kingship.  The Tr\u1ea7n king assembled all his citizens, allowing all to vote on whether to surrender to the Yuan or to stand and fight for their homeland. The vote was a unanimous decision to stand and fight the invaders.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe second Mongol invasion of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t began late in 1284, when the Mongol Yuan forces under the command of [[Toghan (son of Kublai)|Toghan]], the prince of Kublai Khan, crossed the border and quickly occupied Th\u0103ng Long (now [[Hanoi]]) in January 1285, after the victorious battle of Omar in V\u1ea1n Ki\u1ebfp (north east of Hanoi). At the same time [[Sogetu]], second in command of the Yuan army, moved from Champa northward and rapidly marched to Nghe An in the north central region of Vietnam, where the army of the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty under general Tr\u1ea7n Kien was defeated and surrendered to him. However, the Tr\u1ea7n king and the commander-in-chief Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o changed their tactics from defence to attack and struck against the Mongols. In April, General [[Tr\u1ea7n Quang Kh\u1ea3i]] defeated Sogetu in [[Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng]] and the Tr\u1ea7n king won a battle in T\u00e2y K\u1ebft, where Sogetu died. Soon after, general [[Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u1eadt Du\u1eadt]] also won a battle in H\u00e0m T\u1eed (now [[H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean]]) and Toghan was defeated by General [[Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o]]. Thus Kublai failed in his first attempt to invade \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t. Toghan hid himself inside a bronze pipe to avoid being killed by the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t archers; this act brought humiliation upon the Mongol Empire and Toghan himself.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAfter his first failure, Kublai wanted to install Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng's brother Tr\u1ea7n \u00cdch T\u1eafc \u2013 who had defected to the Mongols \u2013 as king of Annam, but hardship in the Yuan's supply base in [[Hunan]] and Kaidu's invasion forced Kublai to abandon his plans. In 1285 the [[Tibet under Yuan rule#Revolt|Drikung Kagyu sect revolted]], attacking Sakya [[gompa|monasteries]].

It was better organized than the previous effort; a large fleet and plentiful stocks of food were used. The Mongol Yuan forces, under the command of Toghan, moved to V\u1ea1n Ki\u1ebfp from the north west and met the infantry and cavalry of Kublai's Kipchak commander Omar (coming by another way along the Red River) and quickly won the battle. The naval fleet rapidly attained victory in V\u00e2n \u0110\u1ed3n near [[H\u1ea1 Long Bay]]. However, the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t General [[Tr\u1ea7n Kh\u00e1nh D\u01b0]] managed to intercept and captured the heavy, fully stocked cargo ships, filled with food and supplies for Toghan's army. As a result, the Mongolian army in Th\u0103ng Long suffered an acute shortage of food. With no news about the supply fleet, Toghan ordered his army to retreat to V\u1ea1n Ki\u1ebfp. The \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t army began their general offensive and recaptured a number of locations occupied by the Mongols. Groups of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t infantry were ordered to attack the Mongols in V\u1ea1n Ki\u1ebfp. Toghan had to split his army into two and retreated in 1288.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn early April 1288 the naval fleet, led by Omar and escorted by infantry, fled home along the [[Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (1288)|B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng river]]. As bridges and roads were destroyed and attacks were launched by \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t troops, the Mongols reached B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng without an infantry escort. \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's small flotilla engaged in battle and pretended to retreat. The Mongols eagerly pursued the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t troops only to fall into their pre-arranged battlefield. Thousands of small \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t boats quickly appeared from both banks, launched a fierce attack that broke the Mongols' combat formation. The Mongols, meeting such a sudden and strong attack, in panic tried to withdraw to the sea. The Mongols' boats were halted, and many were damaged and sank. At that time, a number of fire rafts quickly rushed toward the Mongols, who were frightened and jumped down to reach the banks where they were dealt a heavy blow by an army led by the Tr\u1ea7n king and [[Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe Mongol naval fleet was totally destroyed and Omar was captured. At the same time, \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's army continuously attacked and smashed to pieces Toghan's army on its withdrawal through L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n. Toghan risked his life to take a shortcut through thick forest in order to flee home. The crown prince was banished to [[Yangzhou]] for life by his father, Kublai Khan. Nevertheless, the Tr\u1ea7n king accepted Kublai Khan's supremacy as the Great Khan in order to avoid more conflicts.

A friend of Zhang's, [[Guo Shoujing]], accompanied him on this mission. Guo was interested in engineering, was an expert astronomer and skilled instrument maker, and he understood that good astronomical observations depended on expertly made instruments. Guo began to construct astronomical instruments, including water clocks for accurate timing and [[armillary sphere|armillary spheres]] that represented the celestial globe. [[Turkestan]]i architect Ikhtiyar al-Din, also known as \"Igder\", designed the buildings of the city of the Khagan, Khanbaliq (Chinese ''Dadu'').<ref>{{cite book |last=Schinz |first=Alfred |title=The Magic Square |page=291}}</ref> Kublai also employed foreign artists to build his new capital; one of them, a [[Newar people|Newar]] named [[Araniko]], built the White [[Stupa]] that was the largest structure in Khanbaliq/Dadu.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lall |first=Kesar |title=A Nepalese Miscellany |page=32}}</ref>\n\nZhang advised Kublai that Guo was a leading expert in hydraulic engineering. Kublai knew the importance of water management for irrigation, transport of grain, and flood control, and he asked Guo to look at these aspects in the area between Dadu (now Beijing) and the Yellow River. To provide Dadu with a new supply of water, Guo found the Baifu spring in Mount Shen and had a {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} channel built to move water to Dadu. He proposed connecting the water supply across different river basins, built new canals with sluices to control the water level, and achieved great success with the improvements he made. This pleased Kublai and Guo was asked to undertake similar projects in other parts of the country. In 1264 he was asked to go to [[Gansu]] to repair the damage that had been caused to the irrigation systems by the years of war during the Mongol advance through the region. Guo travelled extensively along with his friend Zhang taking notes of the work needed to be done to unblock damaged parts of the system and to make improvements to its efficiency.

Kublai's force pursued Nayan, who was eventually captured and executed without bloodshed, by being smothered under felt carpets, a traditional way of executing princes.<ref name=\"Amitai-PreissMorgan33\"/> Meanwhile, the rebel prince Shikqtur invaded the Chinese district of [[Liaoning]] but was defeated within a month. Kaidu withdrew westward to avoid a battle. However, Kaidu defeated a major Yuan army in the [[Khangai Mountains]] and briefly occupied Karakorum in 1289. Kaidu had ridden away before Kublai could mobilize a larger army.<ref name=\"Grousset294\"/>\n\nWidespread but uncoordinated uprisings of Nayan's supporters continued until 1289; these were ruthlessly repressed.

Bayan was in control of Karakorum and was re-establishing control over surrounding areas in 1293, so Kublai's rival Kaidu did not attempt any large-scale military action for the next three years. From 1293 on, Kublai's army cleared Kaidu's forces from the [[Central Siberian Plateau]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nAfter his wife Chabi died in 1281, Kublai began to withdraw from direct contact with his advisers, and he issued instructions through one of his other queens, Nambui. Only two of Kublai's daughters are known by name; he may have had others. Unlike the formidable women of his grandfather's day, Kublai's wives and daughters were an almost invisible presence. Kublai's original choice of successor was his son [[Zhenjin]], who became the head of the [[Zhongshu Sheng]] and actively administered the dynasty according to [[Confucian]] fashion. Nomukhan, after returning from captivity in the [[Golden Horde]], expressed resentment that Zhenjin had been made heir apparent, but he was banished to the north. An official proposed that Kublai should abdicate in favor of Zhenjin in 1285, a suggestion that angered Kublai, who refused to see Zhenjin. Zhenjin died soon afterwards in 1286, eight years before his father. Kublai regretted this and remained very close to his wife, Bairam (also known as Kokejin).{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nKublai became increasingly despondent after the deaths of his favorite wife and his chosen heir Zhenjin. The failure of the military campaigns in Vietnam and Japan also haunted him. Kublai turned to food and drink for comfort, became grossly overweight, and suffered gout and diabetes. The emperor overindulged in alcohol and the traditional meat-rich Mongol diet, which may have contributed to his gout. Kublai sank into depression due to the loss of his family, his poor health and advancing age. Kublai tried every medical treatment available, from Korean shamans to Vietnamese doctors, and remedies and medicines, but to no avail. At the end of 1293, the emperor refused to participate in the traditional New Years' ceremony. Before his death, Kublai passed the seal of Crown Prince to Zhenjin's son [[Tem\u00fcr Khan|Tem\u00fcr]], who would become the next Khagan of the Mongol Empire and the second ruler of the Yuan dynasty. Seeking an old companion to comfort him in his final illness, the palace staff could choose only Bayan, more than 30 years his junior. Kublai weakened steadily, and on February 18, 1294, he died at the age of 78. Two days later, the funeral cort\u00e8ge took his body to the burial place of the khans in Mongolia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Poetry==\n[[File:Summer Palace, Beijing, China.jpg|270px|thumb|[[Summer Palace#Longevity Hill|Longevity Hill]] in [[Beijing]], where Kublai Khan wrote his poem.]]\n\nKublai was a prolific writer of Chinese poetry, though most of his works have not survived. Only one Chinese poem written by him is included in the ''Selection of Yuan Poetry'' (\u5143\u8a69\u9078), titled 'Inspiration recorded while enjoying the ascent to Spring Mountain'. It was translated into Mongolian by the Inner Mongolian scholar B.Buyan in the same style as classical Mongolian poetry and transcribed into Cyrillic by Ya.Ganbaatar.

As his grandfather [[Genghis Khan]] advised, Sorghaghtani chose a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Tangut people|Tangut]] woman as her son's nurse, whom Kublai later honored highly. On his way home after the [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia]], Genghis Khan performed a ceremony on his grandsons M\u00f6ngke and Kublai after their first hunt in 1224 near the [[Ili River]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Weatherford |title=The Secret History of the Mongol Queens |page=135}}</ref> Kublai was nine years old and with his eldest brother killed a rabbit and an antelope. After his grandfather smeared fat from killed animals onto Kublai's middle finger in accordance with a Mongol tradition, he said \"The words of this boy [[Kublai]] are full of wisdom, heed them well \u2013 heed them all of you.\" The elderly Khagan (Mongol emperor) Genghis Khan would die three years after this event in 1227, when Kublai was 12. Kublai's father Tolui would serve as regent for two years until Genghis' successor, Kublai's third uncle [[Ogedei Khan|Ogedei]], was enthroned as Khagan in 1229.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAfter the [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty]], in 1236, Ogedei gave [[Hebei]] (attached with 80,000 households) to the family of Tolui, who died in 1232. Kublai received an estate of his own, which included 10,000 households. Because he was inexperienced, Kublai allowed local officials free rein. Corruption amongst his officials and aggressive taxation caused large numbers of Chinese peasants to flee, which led to a decline in tax revenues. Kublai quickly came to his [[appanage]] in Hebei and ordered reforms. Sorghaghtani sent new officials to help him and tax laws were revised. Thanks to those efforts, many of the people who fled returned.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe most prominent, and arguably most influential, component of Kublai Khan's early life was his study and strong attraction to contemporary [[Chinese culture]]. Kublai invited Haiyun, the leading Buddhist monk in North China, to his [[Orda (organization)|ordo]] in Mongolia. When he met Haiyun in Karakorum in 1242, Kublai asked him about the philosophy of Buddhism. Haiyun named Kublai's son, who was born in 1243, [[Zhenjin]] (Chinese: ''True Gold'').<ref name=\"Man2007p37\">{{harvnb|Man|2007|p=37}}</ref> Haiyun also introduced Kublai to the formerly [[Taoism|Daoist]], and at the time Buddhist monk, Liu Bingzhong.

Kublai received the [[viceroy]]alty over North China and moved his ordo to central [[Inner Mongolia]]. During his years as viceroy, Kublai managed his territory well, boosted the agricultural output of [[Henan]], and increased social welfare spendings after receiving [[Xi'an]]. These acts received great acclaim from the Chinese warlords and were essential to the building of the Yuan Dynasty. In 1252, Kublai criticized Mahmud Yalavach, who was never highly valued by his Chinese associates, over his cavalier execution of suspects during a judicial review, and Zhao Bi attacked him for his presumptuous attitude toward the throne.

It is believed that both attempts were partly thwarted by bad weather or a flaw in the design of ships that were based on river boats without keels, and his fleets were destroyed. The first attempt took place in 1274, with a fleet of 900 ships.<ref>\u0416.\u0413\u0430\u043d\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0434, \u0422.\u041c\u04e9\u043d\u0445\u0446\u044d\u0446\u044d\u0433, \u0414.\u041d\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d, \u0410.\u041f\u0443\u043d\u0441\u0430\u0433-\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d \u042e\u0430\u043d\u044c \u0443\u043b\u0441, \u0445\u0443\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0441 122</ref>\n\nThe second invasion occurred in 1281 when Mongols sent two separate forces: 900 ships containing 40,000 Korean, Chinese, and Mongol troops were sent from Masan, while a force of 100,000 sailed from southern China in 3,500 ships, each close to {{convert|240|ft|m}} long. The fleet was hastily assembled and ill-equipped to cope with maritime conditions. In November, they sailed into the treacherous waters that separate Korea and Japan by 110 miles. The Mongols easily took over [[Tsushima Island]] about halfway across the strait and then [[Iki Island]] closer to [[Kyushu]]. The Korean fleet reached [[Hakata Bay]] on June 23, 1281 and landed its troops and animals, but the ships from China were nowhere to be seen. Mongolian landing forces were subsequently defeated at the Battle of Akasaka and the Battle of Torikai-Gata.  [[Takezaki Suenaga]]'s samurai attacked the Mongolian army and fought them, as reinforcements led by Shiraishi Michiyasu  arrived and defeated the Mongolians, who suffered around 3500 dead.<ref>\u300e\u9ad8\u9e97\u53f2\u300f \u5dfb\u516b\u5341\u4e03\u3000\u8868\u5dfb\u7b2c\u4e8c\u300c\u5341\u6708\u3001\u91d1\u65b9\u6176\u8207\u5143\u5143\u5e25\u5ffd\u6566\u6d2a\u8336\u4e18\u7b49\u5f81\u65e5\u672c\u3001\u81f3\u58f9\u5c90\u6230\u6557\u3001\u8ecd\u4e0d\u9084\u8005\u842c\u4e09\u5343\u4e94\u767e\u9918\u4eba\u300d</ref>\n\nThe [[samurai]] warriors, following their custom, rode out against the Mongol forces for individual combat but the Mongols held their formation. The Mongols fought as a united force, not as individuals, and bombarded the samurai with exploding missiles and showered them with arrows. Eventually, the remaining Japanese withdrew from the coastal zone inland to a fortress. The Mongol forces did not chase the fleeing Japanese into an area about which they lacked reliable intelligence.  In a number of individual skirmishes, known collectively as the K\u014dan Campaign (\u5f18\u5b89\u306e\u5f79) or the \"Second Battle of Hakata Bay\", the Mongol forces were driven back to their ships by the Samurai. The Japanese army was heavily outnumbered, but had fortified the coastal line with two-meter high walls, and was easily able to repulse the Mongolian forces that were launched against it.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[File:Takezaki suenaga ekotoba3.jpg|thumb|350px|Japanese [[samurai]] boarding Yuan ships in 1281.]]\n\n[[Maritime archaeology|Maritime archaeologist]] Kenzo Hayashida led the investigation that discovered the wreckage of the second invasion fleet off the western coast of [[Takashima District, Shiga]]. His team's findings strongly indicate that Kublai rushed to invade Japan and attempted to construct his enormous fleet in one year, a task that should have taken up to five years. This forced the Chinese to use any available ships, including river boats. Most importantly, the Chinese, under Kublai's control, built many ships quickly in order to contribute to the fleets in both of the invasions. Hayashida theorizes that, had Kublai used standard, well-constructed ocean-going ships with curved keels to prevent capsizing, his navy might have survived the journey to and from Japan and might have conquered it as intended. In October 2011, a wreck, possibly one of Kublai's invasion craft, was found off the coast of [[Nagasaki]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-10-25/asia/world_asia_japan-archaeology-shipwreck_1_fleet-ship-invasion?_s=PM:ASIA |title=Shipwreck may be part of Kublai Khan's lost fleet |date=October 25, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027212311/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-10-25/asia/world_asia_japan-archaeology-shipwreck_1_fleet-ship-invasion?_s=PM:ASIA |archivedate=October 27, 2011 }}</ref> David Nicolle wrote in ''The Mongol Warlords'', \"Huge losses had also been suffered in terms of casualties and sheer expense, while the myth of Mongol invincibility had been shattered throughout eastern Asia.\" He also wrote that Kublai was determined to mount a third invasion, despite the horrendous cost to the economy and to his and Mongol prestige of the first two defeats, and only his death and the unanimous agreement of his advisers not to invade prevented a third attempt.<ref>Nicolle, David ''The Mongol Warlords''</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:MokoShuraiE-Kotoba I.jpg|Mongol soldiers, second version\nFile:MokoShuraiE-Kotoba III.jpg|Mongol ships, second version\nFile:YuanJunk(14thcentury).jpg|Painting of a 14th-century prized Yuan dynasty [[Junk (ship)|junk]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Invasions of Vietnam===\n{{main|Mongol invasions of Vietnam}}\nKublai Khan invaded [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] (now Vietnam) three times, each repelled by the ruling [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]].

Kublai sent another envoy to the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to demand that the Tr\u1ea7n king surrender his land and his kingship.  The Tr\u1ea7n king assembled all his citizens, allowing all to vote on whether to surrender to the Yuan or to stand and fight for their homeland. The vote was a unanimous decision to stand and fight the invaders.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe second Mongol invasion of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t began late in 1284, when the Mongol Yuan forces under the command of [[Toghan (son of Kublai)|Toghan]], the prince of Kublai Khan, crossed the border and quickly occupied Th\u0103ng Long (now [[Hanoi]]) in January 1285, after the victorious battle of Omar in V\u1ea1n Ki\u1ebfp (north east of Hanoi). At the same time [[Sogetu]], second in command of the Yuan army, moved from Champa northward and rapidly marched to Nghe An in the north central region of Vietnam, where the army of the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty under general Tr\u1ea7n Kien was defeated and surrendered to him. However, the Tr\u1ea7n king and the commander-in-chief Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o changed their tactics from defence to attack and struck against the Mongols. In April, General [[Tr\u1ea7n Quang Kh\u1ea3i]] defeated Sogetu in [[Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng]] and the Tr\u1ea7n king won a battle in T\u00e2y K\u1ebft, where Sogetu died. Soon after, general [[Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u1eadt Du\u1eadt]] also won a battle in H\u00e0m T\u1eed (now [[H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean]]) and Toghan was defeated by General [[Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o]]. Thus Kublai failed in his first attempt to invade \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t. Toghan hid himself inside a bronze pipe to avoid being killed by the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t archers; this act brought humiliation upon the Mongol Empire and Toghan himself.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAfter his first failure, Kublai wanted to install Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng's brother Tr\u1ea7n \u00cdch T\u1eafc \u2013 who had defected to the Mongols \u2013 as king of Annam, but hardship in the Yuan's supply base in [[Hunan]] and Kaidu's invasion forced Kublai to abandon his plans. In 1285 the [[Tibet under Yuan rule#Revolt|Drikung Kagyu sect revolted]], attacking Sakya [[gompa|monasteries]].

After Kublai's grandson [[Buqa-Tem\u00fcr]] crushed the resistance of the [[Drikung Kagyu]], killing 10,000 Tibetans in 1291, Tibet was fully pacified.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe third Mongol invasion began in 1287. It was better organized than the previous effort; a large fleet and plentiful stocks of food were used. The Mongol Yuan forces, under the command of Toghan, moved to V\u1ea1n Ki\u1ebfp from the north west and met the infantry and cavalry of Kublai's Kipchak commander Omar (coming by another way along the Red River) and quickly won the battle. The naval fleet rapidly attained victory in V\u00e2n \u0110\u1ed3n near [[H\u1ea1 Long Bay]]. However, the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t General [[Tr\u1ea7n Kh\u00e1nh D\u01b0]] managed to intercept and captured the heavy, fully stocked cargo ships, filled with food and supplies for Toghan's army. As a result, the Mongolian army in Th\u0103ng Long suffered an acute shortage of food. With no news about the supply fleet, Toghan ordered his army to retreat to V\u1ea1n Ki\u1ebfp. The \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t army began their general offensive and recaptured a number of locations occupied by the Mongols. Groups of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t infantry were ordered to attack the Mongols in V\u1ea1n Ki\u1ebfp. Toghan had to split his army into two and retreated in 1288.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn early April 1288 the naval fleet, led by Omar and escorted by infantry, fled home along the [[Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (1288)|B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng river]]. As bridges and roads were destroyed and attacks were launched by \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t troops, the Mongols reached B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng without an infantry escort. \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's small flotilla engaged in battle and pretended to retreat. The Mongols eagerly pursued the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t troops only to fall into their pre-arranged battlefield. Thousands of small \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t boats quickly appeared from both banks, launched a fierce attack that broke the Mongols' combat formation. The Mongols, meeting such a sudden and strong attack, in panic tried to withdraw to the sea. The Mongols' boats were halted, and many were damaged and sank. At that time, a number of fire rafts quickly rushed toward the Mongols, who were frightened and jumped down to reach the banks where they were dealt a heavy blow by an army led by the Tr\u1ea7n king and [[Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe Mongol naval fleet was totally destroyed and Omar was captured.

Toghan risked his life to take a shortcut through thick forest in order to flee home. The crown prince was banished to [[Yangzhou]] for life by his father, Kublai Khan. Nevertheless, the Tr\u1ea7n king accepted Kublai Khan's supremacy as the Great Khan in order to avoid more conflicts.

The presence of Mongol power allowed large numbers of Chinese, intent on warfare or trade, to travel to other parts of the Mongol Empire, all the way to Rus, Persia, and [[Mesopotamia]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[File:VoyagesOfRabbanBarSauma.jpg|thumb|270px|right|[[Rabban Bar Sauma]], ambassador of Great Khan [[Kublai]] and Ilkhan [[Arghun]], travelled from Dadu to Rome, Tuscany, Genoa, Paris, and [[Bordeaux]] to meet with European rulers in 1287\u201388.]]\n\n==Capital City==\n[[File:Miaoyingsi baita.jpg|thumb|right|The White Stupa of Dadu (or Khanbaliq; now [[Beijing]])]]\n\n===Xanadu===\nAfter Kublai Khan was proclaimed Khagan at his residence in [[Xanadu, China|Xanadu]] on May 5, 1260, he began to organize the country. Zhang Wenqian, a central government official, was sent by Kublai in 1260 to Daming where unrest had been reported in the local population. A friend of Zhang's, [[Guo Shoujing]], accompanied him on this mission. Guo was interested in engineering, was an expert astronomer and skilled instrument maker, and he understood that good astronomical observations depended on expertly made instruments. Guo began to construct astronomical instruments, including water clocks for accurate timing and [[armillary sphere|armillary spheres]] that represented the celestial globe. [[Turkestan]]i architect Ikhtiyar al-Din, also known as \"Igder\", designed the buildings of the city of the Khagan, Khanbaliq (Chinese ''Dadu'').<ref>{{cite book |last=Schinz |first=Alfred |title=The Magic Square |page=291}}</ref> Kublai also employed foreign artists to build his new capital; one of them, a [[Newar people|Newar]] named [[Araniko]], built the White [[Stupa]] that was the largest structure in Khanbaliq/Dadu.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lall |first=Kesar |title=A Nepalese Miscellany |page=32}}</ref>\n\nZhang advised Kublai that Guo was a leading expert in hydraulic engineering. Kublai knew the importance of water management for irrigation, transport of grain, and flood control, and he asked Guo to look at these aspects in the area between Dadu (now Beijing) and the Yellow River. To provide Dadu with a new supply of water, Guo found the Baifu spring in Mount Shen and had a {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} channel built to move water to Dadu. He proposed connecting the water supply across different river basins, built new canals with sluices to control the water level, and achieved great success with the improvements he made. This pleased Kublai and Guo was asked to undertake similar projects in other parts of the country. In 1264 he was asked to go to [[Gansu]] to repair the damage that had been caused to the irrigation systems by the years of war during the Mongol advance through the region. Guo travelled extensively along with his friend Zhang taking notes of the work needed to be done to unblock damaged parts of the system and to make improvements to its efficiency. He sent his report directly to Kublai Khan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Nayan's rebellion==\nDuring the conquest of the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]], Genghis Khan's younger brothers received large [[appanage]]s in [[Manchuria]].<ref>Paul Pelliot, ''Notes on Marco Polo'', p. 85</ref> Their descendants strongly supported Kublai's coronation in 1260, but the younger generation desired more independence. Kublai enforced \u00d6gedei Khan's regulations that the Mongol noblemen could appoint overseers and the Great Khan's special officials, in their appanages, but otherwise respected appanage rights. Kublai's son Manggala established direct control over [[Chang'an]] and [[Shanxi]] in 1272.

Kublai sent Bayan to keep Nayan and Kaidu apart by occupying Karakorum, while Kublai led another army against the rebels in Manchuria. Kublai's commander Oz Tem\u00fcr's Mongol force attacked Nayan's 60,000 inexperienced soldiers on June 14, while Chinese and Alan guards under Li Ting protected Kublai. The army of [[Chungnyeol of Goryeo]] assisted Kublai in battle. After a hard fight, Nayan's troops withdrew behind their carts, and Li Ting began bombardment and attacked Nayan's camp that night. Kublai's force pursued Nayan, who was eventually captured and executed without bloodshed, by being smothered under felt carpets, a traditional way of executing princes.<ref name=\"Amitai-PreissMorgan33\"/> Meanwhile, the rebel prince Shikqtur invaded the Chinese district of [[Liaoning]] but was defeated within a month. Kaidu withdrew westward to avoid a battle. However, Kaidu defeated a major Yuan army in the [[Khangai Mountains]] and briefly occupied Karakorum in 1289. Kaidu had ridden away before Kublai could mobilize a larger army.<ref name=\"Grousset294\"/>\n\nWidespread but uncoordinated uprisings of Nayan's supporters continued until 1289; these were ruthlessly repressed.

Bayan was in control of Karakorum and was re-establishing control over surrounding areas in 1293, so Kublai's rival Kaidu did not attempt any large-scale military action for the next three years. From 1293 on, Kublai's army cleared Kaidu's forces from the [[Central Siberian Plateau]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nAfter his wife Chabi died in 1281, Kublai began to withdraw from direct contact with his advisers, and he issued instructions through one of his other queens, Nambui. Only two of Kublai's daughters are known by name; he may have had others. Unlike the formidable women of his grandfather's day, Kublai's wives and daughters were an almost invisible presence. Kublai's original choice of successor was his son [[Zhenjin]], who became the head of the [[Zhongshu Sheng]] and actively administered the dynasty according to [[Confucian]] fashion. Nomukhan, after returning from captivity in the [[Golden Horde]], expressed resentment that Zhenjin had been made heir apparent, but he was banished to the north. An official proposed that Kublai should abdicate in favor of Zhenjin in 1285, a suggestion that angered Kublai, who refused to see Zhenjin. Zhenjin died soon afterwards in 1286, eight years before his father. Kublai regretted this and remained very close to his wife, Bairam (also known as Kokejin).{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nKublai became increasingly despondent after the deaths of his favorite wife and his chosen heir Zhenjin. The failure of the military campaigns in Vietnam and Japan also haunted him. Kublai turned to food and drink for comfort, became grossly overweight, and suffered gout and diabetes. The emperor overindulged in alcohol and the traditional meat-rich Mongol diet, which may have contributed to his gout. Kublai sank into depression due to the loss of his family, his poor health and advancing age. Kublai tried every medical treatment available, from Korean shamans to Vietnamese doctors, and remedies and medicines, but to no avail. At the end of 1293, the emperor refused to participate in the traditional New Years' ceremony. Before his death, Kublai passed the seal of Crown Prince to Zhenjin's son [[Tem\u00fcr Khan|Tem\u00fcr]], who would become the next Khagan of the Mongol Empire and the second ruler of the Yuan dynasty. Seeking an old companion to comfort him in his final illness, the palace staff could choose only Bayan, more than 30 years his junior. Kublai weakened steadily, and on February 18, 1294, he died at the age of 78. Two days later, the funeral cort\u00e8ge took his body to the burial place of the khans in Mongolia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Poetry==\n[[File:Summer Palace, Beijing, China.jpg|270px|thumb|[[Summer Palace#Longevity Hill|Longevity Hill]] in [[Beijing]], where Kublai Khan wrote his poem.]]\n\nKublai was a prolific writer of Chinese poetry, though most of his works have not survived.

It was translated into Mongolian by the Inner Mongolian scholar B.Buyan in the same style as classical Mongolian poetry and transcribed into Cyrillic by Ya.Ganbaatar.
