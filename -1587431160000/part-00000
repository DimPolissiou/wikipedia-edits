All buses and streetcars have a Presto reader at each door. Presto customers may board by any door on a streetcar.  On most buses, customers can only board by the front door, unless that bus is replacing a streetcar or inside the fare paid zone of a subway station. Customers using [[Wheel-Trans]] vehicles can pay their fare using a Presto card with stored value or a TTC monthly pass loaded on it, as well as with a 1-ride, 2-ride or day pass Presto ticket.<ref name=\"TTC-Presto-FAQ\" />\n\nWhen paying a single fare, Presto automatically records a timed transfer on the Presto card or ticket. From the time of initial tap-on, a transfer with Presto is valid for two hours, during which passengers can enter and exit TTC vehicles or subway stations and change direction of travel repeatedly without having to pay any additional fare.<ref name=\"2hourtransfer\" /><ref name=\"TTC-Presto-FAQ\" /><ref name=\"TTC-2020-01-13\" /> Presto readers on the TTC give no indication as to how must time is left within a two-hour transfer.

Optionally, a monthly and 12-month Downtown Express pass is also available on the Presto card.<ref name=\"ttc_downtownexpress\" />\n\nPresto card customers can pay GTA zone fares for TTC bus routes serving areas outside of the City of Toronto. A TTC fare is charged to the Presto card within Toronto. A [[MiWay]] fare is charged on TTC buses travelling west of Toronto Pearson International Airport in [[Mississauga]]. (This does not apply to TTC buses terminating at the airport.) A [[York Region Transit|YRT]] fare is charged on TTC buses travelling north of Steeles Avenue into [[York Region]]. Riders crossing the zone boundary must tap their Presto card twice, once when boarding the bus and again when leaving.<ref name=\"TTC_GTA_Zone_Fares\" />\n\nCustomers require proof-of-payment when riding streetcars.

It allowed group travel on Sundays and holidays, similar to the later day pass. However, because the TTC was always heavily used on the last day of the [[Canadian National Exhibition]], the pass was not offered on [[Labour Day#Canada|Labour Day]].\n\nIn 1990, the Sunday or holiday pass was replaced by the day pass. It remained valid on Sundays and holidays for groups, but was extended to weekdays and Saturdays as a single-person pass. On weekdays, however, it was not valid until the end of the morning rush hour at 9:30&nbsp;a.m.\n\nAround 1994, the TTC began announcing specific periods around Christmas, and sometimes other holidays, when the day pass would be accepted as a group pass on any day. Starting around 2002, they also offered transferable weekly passes during certain weeks.\n\nIn 2005, with a political climate including the prospect of subsidies tied to ridership, the TTC became more willing to promote pass usage even at the loss of other fares. In March, the TTC extended the day pass to be usable by groups on Saturdays. Later in September, the TTC made the Metropass transferable and introduced the transferable weekly pass.\n\n====Metropass (1980\u20132018)====\n[[File:TTC-November-SMetropass.JPG|thumb|right|A TTC senior/student monthly Metropass]]\nThe TTC has always been cautious about the loss of revenue from selling passes to riders who would otherwise make the same trips and pay more. Passes have been introduced gradually and always been relatively expensive compared to some other transit systems: for example, in the fares adopted in 2014, an adult Metropass must be used for 50 trips in a month or else concessionary tickets or tokens would be cheaper. (However, since July 2006, a federal income tax credit has been available on monthly transit passes. For those able to buy a pass and wait for their federal transit tax credit, which is 15 percent, the threshold is reduced to 43 trips per month.)<ref>http://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Prices/</ref><ref>http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/ncm-tx/rtrn/cmpltng/ddctns/lns360-390/364/</ref>\n\nThe TTC introduced the Metropass in 1980. At that time, there was only one price, based on the adult fare. The pass was not transferable and had to be used with TTC-issued [[identity document|photo ID]] cards (in about 2000 the TTC also began accepting Ontario [[driver's license|driver's licence]]s as ID). A lower-price Metropass for seniors was added in 1984, and for students in 1991 (originally at a slightly higher rate than seniors). The magnetic strip was added to the pass in 1990, allowing it to operate automatic turnstiles, even though this meant that the user's ID would then not normally be checked.\n\nTo combat fraud and sharing the pass amongst riders, a printable box was placed on the right-hand side of the card. To make the pass valid for the month, the commuter hand-printed the digits of either the commuter's Metropass photo ID card, if the commuter had one, or the commuter's initials and abbreviated gender if the commuter used other ID. The holder of the pass was also required to show the commuter's Metropass photo ID card or another piece of [[Government of Ontario]]-issued identification at the same time that the holder presented their pass.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2009, free parking for Metropass users was provided at certain subway-station parking lots. Some lots were restricted to Metropass users.\n\nIn February 1993, the Metropass became the same size as a credit card and could be swiped at subway stations. The new design was a simple mono-coloured and two-shaded design, with the abbreviation of the month in a large font, and the year placed beneath it in the same font and colour. The background of the card's front had a shaded design so as to enable the holder to distinguish the text on the card.\n\nAt about the same time, the TTC introduced an annual Metropass, good for a whole year. As a higher-cost option, the pass was available in transferable form: the first transferable pass on the TTC. Both versions were soon withdrawn and replaced by the 12-month discount plan for the regular monthly pass.\n\nFrom July 1996 to March 2004, the pass carried a faux gold-stamped version of the Toronto Transit Commission's seal.\n\nIn 2000, the design was altered to include the \"Toronto Millennium\" logo, celebrating the changeover to a new millennium.\n\nFares on the provincially operated [[GO Transit]] are separate from TTC fares for travel within and outside of Toronto. A \"Twin Pass\", which combined a Metropass with a monthly GO Transit ticket for a specific journey at a discount compared to their individual prices, was available from 1988 until 2002.\n\nIn April 2004, the Metropass changed its design to a multi-colour vertical gradient, along with a different type of faux gold-imprinted \"Metropass\" logo (it uses the unique TTC font used in several subway stations). The colours and pattern of the gradient vary from month to month. In addition, the year was now printed in a bold font at the upper right, with the month imprinted in the same faux gold as the Metropass logo.\n\nIn September 2005, the Metropass became transferable (with ID required only to prove eligibility for the senior or student fare). The printable anti-fraud box was removed and replaced by wording suggesting the transfer of the pass to others when one was not using it.\n\nThough the reverse side of the pass has always had the conditions of use printed on the reverse, it did not see much updating until the passes were made transferable in 2005, at which point a \"No Pass Back\" rule was added: in essence, a rider who enters the system using a pass must not hand it to someone outside the fare-paid area, which would allow both to use it at once.\n\nIn February 2006, to reduce lineups at subway station fare collector booths, the TTC introduced automated Metropass vending machines (accepting payment only by credit or debit cards) at some subway stations which dispensed weekly and monthly Metropasses. These have since been removed and replaced by new Presto vending machines as of 2018, which allow customers to purchase a new Presto card or load money or a digital monthly TTC pass onto the electronic fare cards as part of the [[Presto card]] rollout.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} In April 2006, the TTC day pass became valid all day on weekdays.\n\nThe TTC redesigned its Metropasses to include custom holograms and a yellow \"activation\" sticker, beginning with the July 2009 Metropasses, due to widespread counterfeiting of the Metropasses between January and May 2009.<ref>[http://www3.ttc.ca/News/2009/June/New_look_TTC_passes_designed_to_thwart_counterfeiters.jsp New-look TTC passes designed to thwart counterfeiters]</ref> In addition, removing the \"activation\" sticker reveals a thin film, which is used to prevent the reapplication of the sticker, and removing the film would leave a sticky residue, in which dirt and other particles can obscure the hologram.<ref>[http://www3.ttc.ca/News/2009/June/Additional_information_regarding_TTC_Metropass_activation_st.jsp Additional information regarding TTC Metropass activation stickers]</ref> The thin film reads, \"Do not remove,\" to prevent curious Metropass users from removing it.\n\nThe TTC offered the Metropass Hot {{sic|Dealz}}, in which a current Metropass user and three guests received an admission discount at various venues and events, such as [[Casa Loma]], the [[CN Tower]], the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], [[Ontario Place]], the [[Ontario Science Centre]], and the [[Toronto Zoo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Passes/Metropass/Metropass_Hot_Dealz/index.jsp |title=Metropass Hot Dealz |publisher=Toronto Transit Commission |accessdate=11 July 2009}}</ref> These competed directly with [[CityPASS]] as the Toronto version of CityPASS applies to some of the same attractions, except that CityPASS is marketed to tourists outside of Toronto, while the Metropass Hot {{sic|Dealz|hide=y}} is marketed to Torontonians.

These have included the [[Pope John Paul II|Papal Visits]] of 1984 and 2002.\n\n===Transfers and POP===\n====Introduction and development of POP====\nPOP was introduced on the Queen streetcar lines in 1990 to make better use of the [[Articulated Light Rail Vehicle]]s on the line.<ref name=\"ttc_pop2006report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ttc.ca/postings/gso-comrpt/documents/report/f2854/_conv.htm|title=PROOF-OF-PAYMENT FARE COLLECTION AT THE TTC|date=19 July 2006|publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]]|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> Prior to August 2014, the POP system was limited to the Queen routes because these routes do not enter a fare-paid terminal of [[List of Toronto subway stations|subway stations]], due to concerns of further [[fare evasion]]. POP is incompatible with the paperless transfer system used by the rail system. The POP system was extended to the 510 Spadina route on 31 August 2014 coinciding with the introduction on that day of new Flexity streetcars; this is because operators on these vehicles are in a closed cab and are not responsible for fare collection and do not normally issue paper POP transfers. The 504 King followed on 1 January 2015, and the 509 Harbourfront route also became POP on 29 March 2015 when the Flexity streetcars were added on that line.<ref name=\"ttc_pop\" /> Since the summer of 2015, route [[511 Bathurst]] has operated occasionally on a POP system during special events, such as the [[2015 Pan American Games]] and the annual [[Canadian National Exhibition]], when the Flexity streetcars are used on that line.<ref name=\"ttc_pop\" />\n\nSince 14 December 2015, all TTC streetcar lines, including streetcar replacement shuttle buses, have operated on a [[proof-of-payment]] (POP) system at all times, in which case fare payments are treated on an [[honour system]] and passengers must carry proof that they have paid the correct fares to show during random spot checks (which can take place on board a vehicle or at subway stations served by streetcar routes). Passengers with proof of payment can board at any door of the vehicle. Forms of POP include an unexpired paper transfer or pass, or Presto fare media with an active transfer.<ref name=\"ttc_pop\" />\n\nUpon request, passengers must present POP. TTC staff such as fare inspectors or special constables who conduct random fare inspections also carry handheld Presto verification machines to verify Presto payments and check transaction history. A [[summons]] such as a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] can be issued if passengers fail to produce POP upon request.<ref name=\"ttc_pop\">{{cite web |url=http://www3.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Fare_information/Proof_of_payment.jsp |title=Proof of Payment (POP) |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |accessdate=4 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525122756/http://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Fare_information/Proof-of-Payment.jsp | archivedate=25 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====St. Clair time-based transfers (2005\u20132017)====\nIn 2005, the TTC introduced \"time-based\" transfers allowing additional free rides within a two-hour time limit from the start of the vehicle's journey, even if the passenger made a stopover or reversed direction. The experiment was linked to the [[Rail replacement bus service|temporary substitution]] of parts of the [[512 St. Clair]] streetcar route by buses due to track reconstruction. Time-based transfers were only available on the St. Clair route; on other routes, they were accepted only at normal transfer points as indicated on the transfer itself. This time-based transfer was not available to load on a [[Presto card]], meaning Presto users who wished to take advantage of this pilot project needed to board at the front door of the vehicle in order to obtain the special time-based transfer, though transfers to other routes could be completed by tapping their Presto card again.<ref>[http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/pdf/time_based_transfer_brochure.pdf (External link, PDF.)]</ref>\n\nThis program came to an end when the new four-door Flexity Outlook streetcars entered service on the 512 St. Clair route on 3 September 2017, as operators on the new streetcars are in a fully enclosed cab, which means the operator is not responsible for fare collection and is not able to provide paper transfers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/st-clair-time-based-transfers-1.4270585|title=Wondering why TTC's ending its 2-hour transfers on St. Clair route? Blame the new streetcars|work=CBC News |access-date=6 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Presto time-based transfers====\nIn November 2017, a Toronto transit advocacy group, [[TTCriders]], along with Toronto mayor [[John Tory]] and two Toronto city councillors including TTC chair Josh Colle, made a request to the TTC to introduce system-wide two-hour time-based transfers across the entire TTC network (a system that is already in place on other local Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area transit agencies). The new system officially debuted on 26 August 2018, following the TTC's board of directors approval on 28 November 2017. The TTC estimates that the program will add five million trips to the system, at a cost of $20.9{{nbsp}}million annually, as this incentive will allow for unlimited travel \u2013 including the ability to enter and exit any TTC vehicles and stations, along with changing their direction of travel \u2013 within two hours from initial tap-on without having to pay another fare.\n\nThe two-hour time-based transfer is only available to Presto users. Paper transfers are only valid for a continuous one-way trip with no stopovers or backtracking permitted.<ref>http://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/PRESTO/Two-Hour_Transfer.jsp</ref><ref name=\"TTC-Presto-FAQ\" />\n\n===Zone fares===\nFrom 1921 until 1953, one TTC fare was good for any distance within the City of Toronto. Where routes extended outside the city, extra fares were charged.\n\nIn 1954, [[Metropolitan Toronto]] (\"Metro\") was created, covering most of [[Amalgamation of Toronto|the city's post-1998 city limits]]. The TTC took on responsibility for transit within the entire area. A flat fare was not considered to be feasible for so large an area; so the TTC created the Central Zone, which roughly incorporated the City of Toronto, and set up a series of concentric semicircular rings around it as Suburban Zones 2\u20135, with an additional fare required for each one. Routes extending beyond the [[City limits|Metro limits]] continued to be separate radial routes, so the zones still had the effect of fare stages, but within Metro, it became possible to change buses within a suburban zone.\n\nIn 1956, Suburban Zones 2 and 3 were combined as Zone 2 and the Central Zone became the new Zone 1.\n\nDuring this early period, the outer zones within Metro were relatively undeveloped and bus routes in them were sparse; but as development increased, there was pressure for lower suburban fares, and in 1962 the outer boundary of Zone 2 was extended to all the way to the Metro limit. Higher fares, still on a zonal basis along each radial route, now applied only on the few routes running beyond Metro; in effect, the zone boundaries outside Zone 2 had changed from semicircles to rough rectangles. Eventually, the beyond\u2013Metro Zones 4 and 5 were combined into a new Zone 2 and the fares coordinated with those of adjacent transit agencies, which is the system used today.\n\nIn 1968, the [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth|Bloor\u2013Danforth Subway]] was extended east and west through the boundary between Zones 1 and 2, but the subway remained part of Zone 1, due to the impracticality of a payment-on-exit system. On 21 January 1973, with construction already well advanced on a similar extension of the [[Line 1 Yonge\u2013University|Yonge\u2013University Subway]], the TTC acceded to pressure to abolish the zone boundary, and all of Metro (now the [[merger (politics)#Canada|unified City of Toronto]]) gained service at a single flat fare. (The new subway stations on both lines in what had been Zone 2 had not been designed for the change: their bus terminals were outside of the subway's fare-paid area. The layout of some stations allowed this to be easily corrected by relocating the fare barrier, but at other stations, this was unfeasible and they were not reconfigured until a later renovation, if at all.)\n\nA situation similar to the former Zone 2 policy exists today on the Line 1 University\u2013Spadina subway, [[Line 1 Yonge\u2013University#Toronto\u2013York Spadina Subway Extension|which was extended]] to neighbouring [[Vaughan]] in [[Regional Municipality of York|York Region]] on 17 December 2017. The stations in Vaughan are treated as part of the TTC fare zone, with a separate fare required when transferring to non-TTC ([[York Region Transit]]/[[Viva Rapid Transit|Viva]], and [[Z\u00fcm]]) bus routes at these stations. The present Zone 2 applies to TTC-contracted bus routes continuing north of [[Steeles Avenue]] or west of [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] (where the zone boundary was moved slightly west to from the city limits at [[Ontario Highway 427|Highway 427]] in 1999),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://transit.toronto.on.ca/bus/routes/58-malton-1955-.shtml |first=James |last=Bow |work=Transit Toronto |title= 58 Malton (1955=2014: July 19, 1999}}</ref> which are the equivalents of the former suburban zonal routes, where a YRT, [[MiWay]] or [[Brampton Transit]] fare is required.\n\n===Presto fare media===\nIn 2007, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) committed to implement the Presto system at 14 of its major subway stations.

The Presto ticket is intended for infrequent TTC customers.<ref name=\"TTC-Presto-FAQ\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/PRESTO/FAQ.jsp |title=Presto Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |accessdate=4 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are three types of Presto ticket: 1-ride, 2-ride and day pass. Unlike Presto cards, Presto tickets do not support concessionary fares. Like Presto cards, there is a two-hour transfer window available for 1- and 2-ride Presto tickets.

For example, an adult can pay with two tokens, or one token plus $3.25, or $6.50 in cash. Those transferring from regular routes pay only the supplement. Effective 26 August 2019, riders can pay both fares using the Presto card.

All buses and streetcars have a Presto reader at each door. Presto customers may board by any door on a streetcar.  On most buses, customers can only board by the front door, unless that bus is replacing a streetcar or inside the fare paid zone of a subway station. Customers using [[Wheel-Trans]] vehicles can pay their fare using a Presto card with stored value or a TTC monthly pass loaded on it, as well as with a 1-ride, 2-ride or day pass Presto ticket.<ref name=\"TTC-Presto-FAQ\" />\n\nWhen paying a single fare, Presto automatically records a timed transfer on the Presto card or ticket. From the time of initial tap-on, a transfer with Presto is valid for two hours, during which passengers can enter and exit TTC vehicles or subway stations and change direction of travel repeatedly without having to pay any additional fare.<ref name=\"2hourtransfer\" /><ref name=\"TTC-Presto-FAQ\" /><ref name=\"TTC-2020-01-13\" /> Presto readers on the TTC give no indication as to how must time is left within a two-hour transfer.

Optionally, a monthly and 12-month Downtown Express pass is also available on the Presto card.<ref name=\"ttc_downtownexpress\" />\n\nPresto card customers can pay GTA zone fares for TTC bus routes serving areas outside of the City of Toronto. A TTC fare is charged to the Presto card within Toronto. A [[MiWay]] fare is charged on TTC buses travelling west of Toronto Pearson International Airport in [[Mississauga]]. (This does not apply to TTC buses terminating at the airport.) A [[York Region Transit|YRT]] fare is charged on TTC buses travelling north of Steeles Avenue into [[York Region]]. Riders crossing the zone boundary must tap their Presto card twice, once when boarding the bus and again when leaving.<ref name=\"TTC_GTA_Zone_Fares\" />\n\nCustomers require proof-of-payment when riding streetcars.

It allowed group travel on Sundays and holidays, similar to the later day pass. However, because the TTC was always heavily used on the last day of the [[Canadian National Exhibition]], the pass was not offered on [[Labour Day#Canada|Labour Day]].\n\nIn 1990, the Sunday or holiday pass was replaced by the day pass. It remained valid on Sundays and holidays for groups, but was extended to weekdays and Saturdays as a single-person pass. On weekdays, however, it was not valid until the end of the morning rush hour at 9:30&nbsp;a.m.\n\nAround 1994, the TTC began announcing specific periods around Christmas, and sometimes other holidays, when the day pass would be accepted as a group pass on any day. Starting around 2002, they also offered transferable weekly passes during certain weeks.\n\nIn 2005, with a political climate including the prospect of subsidies tied to ridership, the TTC became more willing to promote pass usage even at the loss of other fares. In March, the TTC extended the day pass to be usable by groups on Saturdays. Later in September, the TTC made the Metropass transferable and introduced the transferable weekly pass.\n\n====Metropass (1980\u20132018)====\n[[File:TTC-November-SMetropass.JPG|thumb|right|A TTC senior/student monthly Metropass]]\nThe TTC has always been cautious about the loss of revenue from selling passes to riders who would otherwise make the same trips and pay more. Passes have been introduced gradually and always been relatively expensive compared to some other transit systems: for example, in the fares adopted in 2014, an adult Metropass must be used for 50 trips in a month or else concessionary tickets or tokens would be cheaper. (However, since July 2006, a federal income tax credit has been available on monthly transit passes. For those able to buy a pass and wait for their federal transit tax credit, which is 15 percent, the threshold is reduced to 43 trips per month.)<ref>http://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Prices/</ref><ref>http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/ncm-tx/rtrn/cmpltng/ddctns/lns360-390/364/</ref>\n\nThe TTC introduced the Metropass in 1980. At that time, there was only one price, based on the adult fare. The pass was not transferable and had to be used with TTC-issued [[identity document|photo ID]] cards (in about 2000 the TTC also began accepting Ontario [[driver's license|driver's licence]]s as ID). A lower-price Metropass for seniors was added in 1984, and for students in 1991 (originally at a slightly higher rate than seniors). The magnetic strip was added to the pass in 1990, allowing it to operate automatic turnstiles, even though this meant that the user's ID would then not normally be checked.\n\nTo combat fraud and sharing the pass amongst riders, a printable box was placed on the right-hand side of the card. To make the pass valid for the month, the commuter hand-printed the digits of either the commuter's Metropass photo ID card, if the commuter had one, or the commuter's initials and abbreviated gender if the commuter used other ID. The holder of the pass was also required to show the commuter's Metropass photo ID card or another piece of [[Government of Ontario]]-issued identification at the same time that the holder presented their pass.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2009, free parking for Metropass users was provided at certain subway-station parking lots. Some lots were restricted to Metropass users.\n\nIn February 1993, the Metropass became the same size as a credit card and could be swiped at subway stations. The new design was a simple mono-coloured and two-shaded design, with the abbreviation of the month in a large font, and the year placed beneath it in the same font and colour. The background of the card's front had a shaded design so as to enable the holder to distinguish the text on the card.\n\nAt about the same time, the TTC introduced an annual Metropass, good for a whole year. As a higher-cost option, the pass was available in transferable form: the first transferable pass on the TTC. Both versions were soon withdrawn and replaced by the 12-month discount plan for the regular monthly pass.\n\nFrom July 1996 to March 2004, the pass carried a faux gold-stamped version of the Toronto Transit Commission's seal.\n\nIn 2000, the design was altered to include the \"Toronto Millennium\" logo, celebrating the changeover to a new millennium.\n\nFares on the provincially operated [[GO Transit]] are separate from TTC fares for travel within and outside of Toronto. A \"Twin Pass\", which combined a Metropass with a monthly GO Transit ticket for a specific journey at a discount compared to their individual prices, was available from 1988 until 2002.\n\nIn April 2004, the Metropass changed its design to a multi-colour vertical gradient, along with a different type of faux gold-imprinted \"Metropass\" logo (it uses the unique TTC font used in several subway stations). The colours and pattern of the gradient vary from month to month. In addition, the year was now printed in a bold font at the upper right, with the month imprinted in the same faux gold as the Metropass logo.\n\nIn September 2005, the Metropass became transferable (with ID required only to prove eligibility for the senior or student fare). The printable anti-fraud box was removed and replaced by wording suggesting the transfer of the pass to others when one was not using it.\n\nThough the reverse side of the pass has always had the conditions of use printed on the reverse, it did not see much updating until the passes were made transferable in 2005, at which point a \"No Pass Back\" rule was added: in essence, a rider who enters the system using a pass must not hand it to someone outside the fare-paid area, which would allow both to use it at once.\n\nIn February 2006, to reduce lineups at subway station fare collector booths, the TTC introduced automated Metropass vending machines (accepting payment only by credit or debit cards) at some subway stations which dispensed weekly and monthly Metropasses. These have since been removed and replaced by new Presto vending machines as of 2018, which allow customers to purchase a new Presto card or load money or a digital monthly TTC pass onto the electronic fare cards as part of the [[Presto card]] rollout.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} In April 2006, the TTC day pass became valid all day on weekdays.\n\nThe TTC redesigned its Metropasses to include custom holograms and a yellow \"activation\" sticker, beginning with the July 2009 Metropasses, due to widespread counterfeiting of the Metropasses between January and May 2009.<ref>[http://www3.ttc.ca/News/2009/June/New_look_TTC_passes_designed_to_thwart_counterfeiters.jsp New-look TTC passes designed to thwart counterfeiters]</ref> In addition, removing the \"activation\" sticker reveals a thin film, which is used to prevent the reapplication of the sticker, and removing the film would leave a sticky residue, in which dirt and other particles can obscure the hologram.<ref>[http://www3.ttc.ca/News/2009/June/Additional_information_regarding_TTC_Metropass_activation_st.jsp Additional information regarding TTC Metropass activation stickers]</ref> The thin film reads, \"Do not remove,\" to prevent curious Metropass users from removing it.\n\nThe TTC offered the Metropass Hot {{sic|Dealz}}, in which a current Metropass user and three guests received an admission discount at various venues and events, such as [[Casa Loma]], the [[CN Tower]], the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], [[Ontario Place]], the [[Ontario Science Centre]], and the [[Toronto Zoo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Passes/Metropass/Metropass_Hot_Dealz/index.jsp |title=Metropass Hot Dealz |publisher=Toronto Transit Commission |accessdate=11 July 2009}}</ref> These competed directly with [[CityPASS]] as the Toronto version of CityPASS applies to some of the same attractions, except that CityPASS is marketed to tourists outside of Toronto, while the Metropass Hot {{sic|Dealz|hide=y}} is marketed to Torontonians.

POP is incompatible with the paperless transfer system used by the rail system. The POP system was extended to the 510 Spadina route on 31 August 2014 coinciding with the introduction on that day of new Flexity streetcars; this is because operators on these vehicles are in a closed cab and are not responsible for fare collection and do not normally issue paper POP transfers. The 504 King followed on 1 January 2015, and the 509 Harbourfront route also became POP on 29 March 2015 when the Flexity streetcars were added on that line.<ref name=\"ttc_pop\" /> Since the summer of 2015, route [[511 Bathurst]] has operated occasionally on a POP system during special events, such as the [[2015 Pan American Games]] and the annual [[Canadian National Exhibition]], when the Flexity streetcars are used on that line.<ref name=\"ttc_pop\" />\n\nSince 14 December 2015, all TTC streetcar lines, including streetcar replacement shuttle buses, have operated on a [[proof-of-payment]] (POP) system at all times, in which case fare payments are treated on an [[honour system]] and passengers must carry proof that they have paid the correct fares to show during random spot checks (which can take place on board a vehicle or at subway stations served by streetcar routes). Passengers with proof of payment can board at any door of the vehicle. Forms of POP include an unexpired paper transfer or pass, or Presto fare media with an active transfer.<ref name=\"ttc_pop\" />\n\nUpon request, passengers must present POP. TTC staff such as fare inspectors or special constables who conduct random fare inspections also carry handheld Presto verification machines to verify Presto payments and check transaction history. A [[summons]] such as a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] can be issued if passengers fail to produce POP upon request.<ref name=\"ttc_pop\">{{cite web |url=http://www3.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Fare_information/Proof_of_payment.jsp |title=Proof of Payment (POP) |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |accessdate=4 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525122756/http://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Fare_information/Proof-of-Payment.jsp | archivedate=25 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====St. Clair time-based transfers (2005\u20132017)====\nIn 2005, the TTC introduced \"time-based\" transfers allowing additional free rides within a two-hour time limit from the start of the vehicle's journey, even if the passenger made a stopover or reversed direction. The experiment was linked to the [[Rail replacement bus service|temporary substitution]] of parts of the [[512 St. Clair]] streetcar route by buses due to track reconstruction. Time-based transfers were only available on the St. Clair route; on other routes, they were accepted only at normal transfer points as indicated on the transfer itself. This time-based transfer was not available to load on a [[Presto card]], meaning Presto users who wished to take advantage of this pilot project needed to board at the front door of the vehicle in order to obtain the special time-based transfer, though transfers to other routes could be completed by tapping their Presto card again.<ref>[http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/pdf/time_based_transfer_brochure.pdf (External link, PDF.)]</ref>\n\nThis program came to an end when the new four-door Flexity Outlook streetcars entered service on the 512 St. Clair route on 3 September 2017, as operators on the new streetcars are in a fully enclosed cab, which means the operator is not responsible for fare collection and is not able to provide paper transfers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/st-clair-time-based-transfers-1.4270585|title=Wondering why TTC's ending its 2-hour transfers on St. Clair route?

The new system officially debuted on 26 August 2018, following the TTC's board of directors approval on 28 November 2017. The TTC estimates that the program will add five million trips to the system, at a cost of $20.9{{nbsp}}million annually, as this incentive will allow for unlimited travel \u2013 including the ability to enter and exit any TTC vehicles and stations, along with changing their direction of travel \u2013 within two hours from initial tap-on without having to pay another fare.\n\nThe two-hour time-based transfer is only available to Presto users. Paper transfers are only valid for a continuous one-way trip with no stopovers or backtracking permitted.<ref>http://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/PRESTO/Two-Hour_Transfer.jsp</ref><ref name=\"TTC-Presto-FAQ\" />\n\n===Zone fares===\nFrom 1921 until 1953, one TTC fare was good for any distance within the City of Toronto. Where routes extended outside the city, extra fares were charged.\n\nIn 1954, [[Metropolitan Toronto]] (\"Metro\") was created, covering most of [[Amalgamation of Toronto|the city's post-1998 city limits]]. The TTC took on responsibility for transit within the entire area. A flat fare was not considered to be feasible for so large an area; so the TTC created the Central Zone, which roughly incorporated the City of Toronto, and set up a series of concentric semicircular rings around it as Suburban Zones 2\u20135, with an additional fare required for each one. Routes extending beyond the [[City limits|Metro limits]] continued to be separate radial routes, so the zones still had the effect of fare stages, but within Metro, it became possible to change buses within a suburban zone.\n\nIn 1956, Suburban Zones 2 and 3 were combined as Zone 2 and the Central Zone became the new Zone 1.\n\nDuring this early period, the outer zones within Metro were relatively undeveloped and bus routes in them were sparse; but as development increased, there was pressure for lower suburban fares, and in 1962 the outer boundary of Zone 2 was extended to all the way to the Metro limit. Higher fares, still on a zonal basis along each radial route, now applied only on the few routes running beyond Metro; in effect, the zone boundaries outside Zone 2 had changed from semicircles to rough rectangles. Eventually, the beyond\u2013Metro Zones 4 and 5 were combined into a new Zone 2 and the fares coordinated with those of adjacent transit agencies, which is the system used today.\n\nIn 1968, the [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth|Bloor\u2013Danforth Subway]] was extended east and west through the boundary between Zones 1 and 2, but the subway remained part of Zone 1, due to the impracticality of a payment-on-exit system. On 21 January 1973, with construction already well advanced on a similar extension of the [[Line 1 Yonge\u2013University|Yonge\u2013University Subway]], the TTC acceded to pressure to abolish the zone boundary, and all of Metro (now the [[merger (politics)#Canada|unified City of Toronto]]) gained service at a single flat fare. (The new subway stations on both lines in what had been Zone 2 had not been designed for the change: their bus terminals were outside of the subway's fare-paid area. The layout of some stations allowed this to be easily corrected by relocating the fare barrier, but at other stations, this was unfeasible and they were not reconfigured until a later renovation, if at all.)\n\nA situation similar to the former Zone 2 policy exists today on the Line 1 University\u2013Spadina subway, [[Line 1 Yonge\u2013University#Toronto\u2013York Spadina Subway Extension|which was extended]] to neighbouring [[Vaughan]] in [[Regional Municipality of York|York Region]] on 17 December 2017.

Though some of the pagan philosophers attained to a relatively high conception of God as the supreme ruler of the world, they seem never to have drawn the next logical inference of His being the absolute cause of all finite existence. [...] The descendants of Sem and Abraham, of Isaac and Jacob, preserved the idea of creation clear and pure; and from the opening verse of Genesis to the closing book of the Old Testament the doctrine of creation runs unmistakably outlined and absolutely undefiled by any extraneous element. \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\" In this, the first, sentence of the Bible we see the fountain-head of the stream which is carried over to the new order by the declaration of the mother of the Machabees: \"Son, look upon heaven and earth, and all that is in them: and consider that God made them out of nothing\" (2 Maccabees 7:28). One has only to compare the Mosaic account of the creative work with that recently discovered on the clay tablets unearthed from the ruins of Babylon to discern the immense difference between the unadulterated revealed tradition and the puerile story of the cosmogony corrupted by polytheistic myths. Between the Hebrew and the Chaldean account there is just sufficient similarity to warrant the supposition that both are versions of some antecedent record or tradition; but no one can avoid the conviction that the Biblical account represents the pure, even if incomplete, truth, while the Babylonian story is both legendary and fragmentary (Smith, \"Chaldean Account of Genesis\", New York, 1875).\n}}\n</ref> which became important to Judaism.\n\nAccording to [[Islam]], God, known in Arabic as [[Allah]], is the all-powerful and all-knowing Creator, Sustainer, Ordainer, and Judge of the universe. Creation is seen as an act of divine choice and mercy, one with a grand purpose: \"And We ([[Royal we]]) did not create the heaven and earth and that between them in play.\"<ref>[[Qur'an 21]]:16, [[Sahih International Translation]]</ref> Rather, the purpose of humanity is to be tested: \"Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving;\"<ref>Qur'an [67:2], Muhsin Khan Translation</ref> Those who pass the test are rewarded with Paradise: \"Verily for the Righteous there will be a fulfilment of (the heart's) desires;\"<ref>Qur'an [78:31], Yusuf Ali Translation</ref>\n\nAccording to the Islamic teachings, God exists above the heavens and the creation itself. The [[Quran]] mentions, \"He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He Istawa (rose over) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything.\"<ref>[[Qur'an 2]]:29, Muhsin Khan Translation</ref> At the same time, God is unlike anything in creation: \"There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.\"<ref>[[Qur'an 42]]:11, [[Sahih International Translation]]</ref> and nobody can perceive God in totality: \"Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted.\"<ref>[[Qur'an 6]]:103, Sahih International Translation</ref> God in Islam is not only majestic and sovereign, but also a personal God: \"And indeed We have created man, and We know what his ownself whispers to him. And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein (by Our Knowledge).\"<ref>Qur'an [50:16], Muhsin Khan Translation</ref> Allah commands the believers to constantly remember Him (\"O you who have believed, remember Allah with much remembrance\"<ref>[[Qur'an 33]]:41, Sahih International Translation</ref>) and to invoke Him alone (\"And whoever invokes besides Allah another deity for which he has no proof - then his account is only with his Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed.\"<ref>[[Qur'an 23]]:117, Sahih International Translation</ref>).\n\nIslam teaches that God as referenced in the Quran is the only god and the same God worshipped by members of other [[Abrahamic religion]]s such as Christianity and Judaism.\n\n===Sikhism===\n{{Main|Sikh beliefs}}\nOne of the biggest responsibilities in the faith of [[Sikhism]] is to worship God as \"The Creator\", termed ''[[Waheguru]]'', who is shapeless, timeless, and sightless, i.e., [[Nirankar]], [[Akal (Sikh term)|Akal]], and [[Alakh Niranjan]].

Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. pg. 36-8</ref>\n\n===Jainism===\n{{Main|Jainism and non-creationism}}\n[[Jainism]] does not support belief in a creator deity. According to Jain doctrine, the [[universe]] and its constituents - soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion have always existed (a [[static universe]] similar to that of [[Epicureanism]] and [[Steady State theory|steady state cosmological model]]). All the constituents and actions are governed by [[Universal Law|universal]] [[natural laws]]. It is not possible to create matter out of nothing and hence the sum total of matter in the universe remains the same (similar to law of [[conservation of mass]]). Similarly, the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] of each living being is unique and uncreated and has existed since beginningless time.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}<ref>Nayanar (2005b), p.190, G\u0101th\u0101 10.310</ref>\n\nThe Jain theory of [[Causality|causation]] holds that a cause and its effect are always identical in nature and therefore a conscious and immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Furthermore, according to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its karmas and desires achieves liberation. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.\n\nThrough the ages, [[Jain Philosophy#Jain philosophers|Jain philosophers]] have adamantly rejected and opposed the concept of creator and omnipotent God and this has resulted in Jainism being labeled as ''[[\u0100stika and n\u0101stika|n\u0101stika darsana]]'' or [[Atheism|atheist philosophy]] by the rival [[Indian philosophy|religious philosophies]]. The theme of non-creationism and absence of omnipotent God and divine grace runs strongly in all the philosophical dimensions of Jainism, including its [[Jain cosmology|cosmology]], [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]] and its moral code of conduct. Jainism asserts a religious and virtuous life is possible without the idea of a creator god.<ref>*{{Cite journal | last =Soni | first =Jayandra | editor =E.

In the beginning there was nothing in the [[universe]] except a formless [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]. However this chaos began to coalesce into a [[world egg|cosmic egg]] for eighteen thousand years. Within it, the perfectly opposed principles of [[yin and yang]] became balanced and Pangu emerged (or woke up) from the egg. Pangu is usually depicted as a primitive, hairy [[giant (mythology)|giant]] with horns on his head (like the Greek [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]) and clad in furs. Pangu set about the task of creating the world: he separated Yin from Yang with a swing of his giant axe, creating the [[Earth]] (murky ''Yin'') and the [[Sky]] (clear ''Yang''). To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the Sky. This task took eighteen thousand years, with each day the sky grew ten feet higher, the Earth ten feet wider, and Pangu ten feet taller. In some versions of the story, Pangu is aided in this task by the four most prominent beasts, namely the [[Turtle]], the [[Qilin]], the [[Chinese phoenix|Phoenix]], and the [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]].\n\nAfter eighteen thousand years<ref>(Note: In ancient China, 18,000 does not exactly mean eighteen thousand, it is meant to be \"many\", or \"a number that could not be counted\").</ref> had elapsed, Pangu was laid to rest. His breath became the [[wind]]; his voice the [[thunder]]; left eye the [[sun]] and right eye the [[moon]]; his body became the [[mountain]]s and extremes of the world; his blood formed rivers; his muscles the fertile lands; his facial hair the stars and milky way; his fur the bushes and forests; his bones the valuable minerals; his bone marrows sacred diamonds; his sweat fell as rain; and the fleas on his fur carried by the wind became [[human being]]s all over the world.\n\nThe first writer to record the myth of Pangu was [[Xu Zheng (Eastern Wu)|Xu Zheng]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.\n\n[[Shangdi]] is another creator deity, possibly prior to Pangu; sharing concepts similar to Abrahamic faiths.\n\n===Kazakh===\nAccording to [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] folk tales, Jasagnan is the creator of the world.<ref>[http://www.chinesefolklore.org.cn/blog/?uid-2072-action-viewspace-itemid-10038 \u4eba\u7c7b\u8d77\u6e90\u795e\u8bdd\uff1a\u897f\u5317\u5730\u533a\u6c11\u65cf\uff0804\uff09\uff1a\u54c8\u8428\u514b\u65cf2-1]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biblical cosmology]]\n* [[Cosmological argument]]\n* [[Creationism]]\n* [[Dating creation]]\n* [[Deism]]\n* [[Existence]]\n* [[Intelligent designer]]\n* [[Tzimtzum]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=web}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Citation | last =Flood | first =Gavin D. | authorlink = Gavin Flood | year =1996 | title =An Introduction to Hinduism | publisher =Cambridge University Press |ref=harv}}\n* {{Citation | last =Kramer | first=Kenneth | year=1986 | title=World scriptures: an introduction to comparative religions | isbn=978-0-8091-2781-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzUAu-43W5oC&pg=PA34 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Citation | last =Michaels | first =Axel | authorlink = Axel Michaels | year =2004 | title =Hinduism.

His father used to worship [[Aten]] alongside other gods of their polytheistic religion. Aten, for a long time before his father's time, was revered as a god among the many gods and goddesses in Egypt. Atenism faded away after the death of the pharaoh.

In each of the first three days there is an act of division: day one divides the darkness from light, day two the \"waters above\" from the \"waters below\", and day three the sea from the land. In each of the next three days these divisions are populated: day four populates the darkness and light with sun, moon, and stars; day five populates seas and skies with fish and fowl; and finally, land-based creatures and mankind populate the land.{{sfn|Ruiten|2000|pp=9-10}}\n\nThe first (the [[Priestly source|Priestly story]]) was concerned with the cosmic plan of creation, while the second (the [[Jahwist|Yahwist story]]) focuses on man as cultivator of his environment and as a moral agent.{{sfn|Alter|1981|p=141}} The second account, in contrast to the regimented seven-day scheme of Genesis 1, uses a simple flowing narrative style that proceeds from God's forming the first man through the [[Garden of Eden]] to the creation of the first woman and the institution of marriage. In contrast to the [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] God of Genesis 1 creating a god-like humanity, the God of Genesis 2 can fail as well as succeed. The humanity he creates is not god-like, but is punished for acts which would lead to their becoming god-like (Genesis 3:1-24) and the order and method of creation itself differs.{{sfn|Carr|1996|p=62-64}} \"Together, this combination of parallel character and contrasting profile point to the different origin of materials in Genesis 1:1 and Gen 2:4, however elegantly they have now been combined.\"{{sfn|Carr|1996|p=64}}\n\nAn early conflation of Greek philosophy with the [[Genesis creation narrative|narratives]] in the Hebrew Bible came from [[Philo of Alexandria]] (d.

Though some of the pagan philosophers attained to a relatively high conception of God as the supreme ruler of the world, they seem never to have drawn the next logical inference of His being the absolute cause of all finite existence. [...] The descendants of Sem and Abraham, of Isaac and Jacob, preserved the idea of creation clear and pure; and from the opening verse of Genesis to the closing book of the Old Testament the doctrine of creation runs unmistakably outlined and absolutely undefiled by any extraneous element. \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\" In this, the first, sentence of the Bible we see the fountain-head of the stream which is carried over to the new order by the declaration of the mother of the Machabees: \"Son, look upon heaven and earth, and all that is in them: and consider that God made them out of nothing\" (2 Maccabees 7:28). One has only to compare the Mosaic account of the creative work with that recently discovered on the clay tablets unearthed from the ruins of Babylon to discern the immense difference between the unadulterated revealed tradition and the puerile story of the cosmogony corrupted by polytheistic myths. Between the Hebrew and the Chaldean account there is just sufficient similarity to warrant the supposition that both are versions of some antecedent record or tradition; but no one can avoid the conviction that the Biblical account represents the pure, even if incomplete, truth, while the Babylonian story is both legendary and fragmentary (Smith, \"Chaldean Account of Genesis\", New York, 1875).\n}}\n</ref> which became important to Judaism.\n\nAccording to [[Islam]], God, known in Arabic as [[Allah]], is the all-powerful and all-knowing Creator, Sustainer, Ordainer, and Judge of the universe.

There are two types of monism, namely spiritual monism which holds that all spiritual reality is one, and material monism which holds that everything including all material reality is one and the same thing.<ref name=\"Anderson2015monism\">{{cite book|author=Owen Anderson|title=The Declaration of Independence and God: Self-Evident Truths in American Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CW2gCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT234| year=2015| publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-40464-5|page=234}}</ref>\n\n==Non-creationism==\n\n===Buddhism===\n{{See also|Creator in Buddhism}}\nBuddhism denies a creator deity and posits that mundane deities such as [[Buddhist cosmology of the Theravada school#Brahm.C4.81 Planes|Mahabrahma]] are misperceived to be a creator.<ref>Harvey, Peter (2013). An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices (2nd ed.). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. pg. 36-8</ref>\n\n===Jainism===\n{{Main|Jainism and non-creationism}}\n[[Jainism]] does not support belief in a creator deity. According to Jain doctrine, the [[universe]] and its constituents - soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion have always existed (a [[static universe]] similar to that of [[Epicureanism]] and [[Steady State theory|steady state cosmological model]]). All the constituents and actions are governed by [[Universal Law|universal]] [[natural laws]]. It is not possible to create matter out of nothing and hence the sum total of matter in the universe remains the same (similar to law of [[conservation of mass]]). Similarly, the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] of each living being is unique and uncreated and has existed since beginningless time.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}<ref>Nayanar (2005b), p.190, G\u0101th\u0101 10.310</ref>\n\nThe Jain theory of [[Causality|causation]] holds that a cause and its effect are always identical in nature and therefore a conscious and immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Furthermore, according to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its karmas and desires achieves liberation. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.\n\nThrough the ages, [[Jain Philosophy#Jain philosophers|Jain philosophers]] have adamantly rejected and opposed the concept of creator and omnipotent God and this has resulted in Jainism being labeled as ''[[\u0100stika and n\u0101stika|n\u0101stika darsana]]'' or [[Atheism|atheist philosophy]] by the rival [[Indian philosophy|religious philosophies]]. The theme of non-creationism and absence of omnipotent God and divine grace runs strongly in all the philosophical dimensions of Jainism, including its [[Jain cosmology|cosmology]], [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]] and its moral code of conduct. Jainism asserts a religious and virtuous life is possible without the idea of a creator god.<ref>*{{Cite journal | last =Soni | first =Jayandra | editor =E.

In the beginning there was nothing in the [[universe]] except a formless [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]. However this chaos began to coalesce into a [[world egg|cosmic egg]] for eighteen thousand years. Within it, the perfectly opposed principles of [[yin and yang]] became balanced and Pangu emerged (or woke up) from the egg. Pangu is usually depicted as a primitive, hairy [[giant (mythology)|giant]] with horns on his head (like the Greek [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]) and clad in furs. Pangu set about the task of creating the world: he separated Yin from Yang with a swing of his giant axe, creating the [[Earth]] (murky ''Yin'') and the [[Sky]] (clear ''Yang''). To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the Sky. This task took eighteen thousand years, with each day the sky grew ten feet higher, the Earth ten feet wider, and Pangu ten feet taller. In some versions of the story, Pangu is aided in this task by the four most prominent beasts, namely the [[Turtle]], the [[Qilin]], the [[Chinese phoenix|Phoenix]], and the [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]].\n\nAfter eighteen thousand years<ref>(Note: In ancient China, 18,000 does not exactly mean eighteen thousand, it is meant to be \"many\", or \"a number that could not be counted\").</ref> had elapsed, Pangu was laid to rest. His breath became the [[wind]]; his voice the [[thunder]]; left eye the [[sun]] and right eye the [[moon]]; his body became the [[mountain]]s and extremes of the world; his blood formed rivers; his muscles the fertile lands; his facial hair the stars and milky way; his fur the bushes and forests; his bones the valuable minerals; his bone marrows sacred diamonds; his sweat fell as rain; and the fleas on his fur carried by the wind became [[human being]]s all over the world.\n\nThe first writer to record the myth of Pangu was [[Xu Zheng (Eastern Wu)|Xu Zheng]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.\n\n[[Shangdi]] is another creator deity, possibly prior to Pangu; sharing concepts similar to Abrahamic faiths.\n\n===Kazakh===\nAccording to [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] folk tales, Jasagnan is the creator of the world.<ref>[http://www.chinesefolklore.org.cn/blog/?uid-2072-action-viewspace-itemid-10038 \u4eba\u7c7b\u8d77\u6e90\u795e\u8bdd\uff1a\u897f\u5317\u5730\u533a\u6c11\u65cf\uff0804\uff09\uff1a\u54c8\u8428\u514b\u65cf2-1]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biblical cosmology]]\n* [[Cosmological argument]]\n* [[Creationism]]\n* [[Dating creation]]\n* [[Deism]]\n* [[Existence]]\n* [[Intelligent designer]]\n* [[Tzimtzum]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=web}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Citation | last =Flood | first =Gavin D. | authorlink = Gavin Flood | year =1996 | title =An Introduction to Hinduism | publisher =Cambridge University Press |ref=harv}}\n* {{Citation | last =Kramer | first=Kenneth | year=1986 | title=World scriptures: an introduction to comparative religions | isbn=978-0-8091-2781-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzUAu-43W5oC&pg=PA34 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Citation | last =Michaels | first =Axel | authorlink = Axel Michaels | year =2004 | title =Hinduism.

In historiography he is known mostly for his role in the 1899 conflict between the [[Archbishop|archbishops]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and [[Seville]]. Catapulted to nationwide notoriety, in the early 1900s he was a point of reference for heated debates on religion and politics; today he is considered a representative of intransigent religious fundamentalism. Roca served as lecturing [[Canon (priest)|canon]] by the cathedrals of [[Las Palmas]] (1876-1892) and Seville (1892-1917), animated some [[Diocese|diocesan]] periodicals, and published numerous booklets. He was one of very few nationally recognizable personalities of the Spanish Church who openly and systematically supported the [[Carlism|Carlist]] cause, though he remained sympathetic also towards the [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrist]] breed of [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]].\n\n==Family and youth==\n[[File:Pla\u00e7a de Vic en un dia de mercat (cropped).jpeg|left|thumb|[[Vic]]h, 19th c.]]\nThe ancient [[Catalan People|Catalan]] family of Roca became very branched throughout the centuries, with its representatives scattered across all of the region. It is not clear what particular line the ancestors of Roca y Ponsa followed; none of the sources consulted provides any information on his distant forefathers. It is established that his father, Cayetano Roca Subirachs (1828-1918),<ref> in some sources his segundo apellido is spelled as \"Subirat\", see e.g. ''La Gaceta de Tenerife'' 09.04.18, available [https://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.do?path=5046667&posicion=1&presentacion=pagina here]. However, the official death certificate of Jos\u00e9 Roca y Ponsa adheres to the \"Subirachs\" spelling, ''Partida de defunci\u00f3n de Jos\u00e9 Roca y Ponsa'', [in:] ''Registro Civil de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria'' 97-1 (95): 49</ref> was a native of [[Vic|Vich]]; he formed part of the local [[bourgeoisie]] and in the mid-19th century either owned or otherwise operated a [[corset]] factory, manufacture or workshop.<ref> ''Coses del Vic vell (13 setembre 1863)'', [in:] ''Diari de Vic'' 05.05.1933, available [https://xacpremsa.cultura.gencat.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000323545&page=1&search= here]</ref> At an unspecified time he married Engracia Ponsa; nothing is known either about her or about her family. The couple settled at Calle de la Riera. It is not clear how many children they had; among Jos\u00e9\u2019s siblings there was at least one brother Cayetano<ref> Cayetano died in 1912, ''La Prensa'' 17.06.12, available [https://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.do?path=1000006296&posicion=1&presentacion=pagina here]</ref> and two sisters, Dolores and Margarita.<ref>Dolores married married Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Mart\u00edn, descendant to a bourgeoisie Las Palmas family. She died shortly afterwards and the widower married her sister, Margarita. The two commenced a prestigious Canarian branch of Gonz\u00e1lez Roca, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Alzola, ''Don Jos\u00e9 Roca y Ponsa'', [in:] Jos\u00e9 Miguel Alzola, ''La Real Cofradia del Sant\u00edsimo Cristo del Buen Fin y la Ermita del Esp\u00edritu Santo'', Las Palmas de Gran Canaria 1992, {{ISBN|8460421279}}, p. 38.

A few sources claim that he \u201ccommenced ecclesiastic education\u201d upon entering the local diocesan Vich [[seminary]] in 1861;<ref> B. de Artagan [Reinaldo Brea], ''Pol\u00edticos del Carlismo'', Barcelona 1903, p. 278, Juan Mar\u00eda Roma (ed.), ''Album hist\u00f3rico del Carlismo'', Barcelona 1933, p. 223</ref> it is not clear whether at the age of 9 he was indeed admitted to the seminary or was rather attending a school run by local Church structures.

Later Sancha and Sp\u00ednola got to know each other better, and in 1904, during coronation of V\u00edrgen de los Reyes, a great Seville feast engineered by Sp\u00ednola, it was Sancha who performed the act. This conciliatory gesture might be interpreted as some sort of apology on part of Sp\u00ednola, ''ABC'' 04.12.2004, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/2004/12/04/018.html here]</ref> it caused a scandal and widespread debate.<ref>during the conflict, lasting for few months between 1899 and 1900, Roca\u2019s \u201cname reverberated across all Spain\u201d, ''ABC'' 04.05.43, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1943/05/04/006.html here]</ref> As a well-known personality he was then active in Catholic congresses staged in the early 1900s.

They were underpinned by confidence that a community without an officially accepted and enforced orthodoxy, a community where various concepts of public life constantly compete for domination, can not form an orderly, peaceful, operational society. In his view the only appropriate orthodoxy was Catholicism, which for centuries shaped the Spanish self and contributed to greatness of the nation; Catholic principles should serve as guidelines organizing both state and society. Their antithesis was [[liberalism]], not only useless as a political doctrine, but also unacceptable as a moral concept; it remained responsible for decline of Spain and would lead to further calamities in the future.<ref> Compare excerpts from ''Observaciones'': \u201cLos males que pesan sobre la Iglesia espa\u00f1ola proceden de nuestras Constituciones liberales.

In historiography he is known mostly for his role in the 1899 conflict between the [[Archbishop|archbishops]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and [[Seville]]. Catapulted to nationwide notoriety, in the early 1900s he was a point of reference for heated debates on religion and politics; today he is considered a representative of intransigent religious fundamentalism. Roca served as lecturing [[Canon (priest)|canon]] by the cathedrals of [[Las Palmas]] (1876-1892) and Seville (1892-1917), animated some [[Diocese|diocesan]] periodicals, and published numerous booklets. He was one of very few nationally recognizable personalities of the Spanish Church who openly and systematically supported the [[Carlism|Carlist]] cause, though he remained sympathetic also towards the [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrist]] breed of [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]].\n\n==Family and youth==\n[[File:Pla\u00e7a de Vic en un dia de mercat (cropped).jpeg|left|thumb|[[Vic]]h, 19th c.]]\nThe ancient [[Catalan People|Catalan]] family of Roca became very branched throughout the centuries, with its representatives scattered across all of the region.

Arroyo. On his first case, Malcolm discovers similarities between the killer and his father, Martin Whitly, an incarcerated serial killer known as \"The Surgeon\". This causes him to suffer night terrors and panic attacks as he finds himself reliving the events leading up to his father's arrest. Against the advice of Gil and his long-suffering mother Jessica, Malcolm visits his father for the first time in ten years for help identifying the killer, who he determines was one of his patients. Faced with the threat of his son abandoning him for good, Dr. Whitly names the killer as wealthy developer Carter Berkhead. Berkhead takes his wife and a cop, Det. Dani Powell, hostage, and an overwhelmed Malcolm offers to trade his life for theirs, distracting Berkhead long enough for Gil to shoot him. Afterwards, Gil tells his officers the truth of Malcolm's identity and asks them to have faith in him.\n| LineColor       = 283633\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Annihilator\n |DirectedBy      = [[Adam Kane]]\n |WrittenBy       = Chris Fedak & Sam Sklaver\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|30}}\n |ProdCode        = T88.10102\n |Viewers         = 3.90<ref name=\"1.02\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-september-30-2019/|title='The Voice,' 'Dancing with the Stars,' and 'The Good Doctor' adjust down: Monday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 1, 2019|accessdate=October 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001210324/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-september-30-2019/|archive-date=October 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Gil invites Malcolm to consult on a new case involving the poisoning of several family members; snakes found in the body of the dead patriarch points to an estranged son who tries to kill Malcolm with snake venom, which triggers a new memory of Dr. Whitly using [[chloroform]] on his son when he discovers an unconscious woman in a locked box. Ainsley discovers that her brother has been visiting their father. Malcolm goes to see Dr. Whitly, and warns him that he will uncover the truth behind his missing memories. When the suspect is reported dead from suicide, Gil gives his team a few hours to prove Malcolm's theory that he was framed. Malcolm and Dani visit the family lawyer, who admits that he was an illegitimate child rejected by the patriarch and so took revenge by killing his family. He then poisons himself and his wife and daughters, but the cops are able to reverse the poisonings. Dani takes an inebriated Malcolm home that night and helps him into bed.

Based on letters recovered from the victim's body, as well as evidence the man's brain was removed after his death, Malcolm suspects that the killer may be a disgruntled former test subject of Brown's. JT discovers that Brown was illegally dosing her students with [[LSD]], resulting in a suicide that she covered up. Jessica becomes concerned that her son's visits with Dr. Whitly are further damaging his fragile mind; she asks Gil to intervene, but he refuses as he feels Malcolm should make his own choices. Brown identifies the suspect, just as Malcolm realizes that the murders are aimed at wiping out everyone involved with her research. While on stakeout, the killer breaks into Brown's house and drugs her before she shoots him dead; Malcolm convinces her to surrender to the police. Jessica pays a visit to her husband to tell him to stop seeing their son, and he takes the opportunity to try and manipulate her.

A social media [[influencer]] is murdered in a manner that Malcolm identifies as likely being the work of a stalker. Accompanied by JT, he picks up Roger, a photographer who has been following the victim for some time, but refuses to reveal evidence that the police believe he possesses out of fear. After the real killer tries to run him over, Malcolm tricks Roger into thinking he's about to die, causing him to hand over the evidence. This points the team towards Axel X, a designer and the victim's former boyfriend who Malcolm realizes is the actual target. Without a warrant to justify taking action, Malcolm seeks out Axel on his own and gets him to give up the killer: his bodyguard Joey. Joey prepares to kill him, but the police spring a trap at the last second, using a wire Malcolm was wearing to take down both Axel and Joey. Gil provides Malcolm with a recording of his mother's interview following his father's arrest; he seemingly forgives her afterwards for lying to him about her knowledge of his crimes.

Gil locates a potential suspect, a dealer who Dani insists is not the killer. Defying orders, she goes to see him with Malcolm in tow. A shootout occurs, and Malcolm is exposed to hallucinogenic drugs; Dani takes him home and puts him to sleep. Jessica meets Eve Blanchard, an attorney who suggests that she invest her family's money in her work fighting human trafficking. Malcolm has a dream involving his own mind, represented as himself in his father's clothes, and tries to find an old box of photos from his childhood to get answers. Dani then reveals that the dealer saved her life three years ago while she was working undercover. They locate the dealer, save him from the killer (a woman seeking revenge for her daughter's death), and fake his murder so he can start over.

His profile suggests that the killer is a sadist, and he correctly infers that the boy's mother is a \"[[Jocasta]]\", a woman with an unhealthy dependence on her son's companionship. Both Jessica and Malcolm are against Ainsley's plan to interview Dr. Whitly, and Jessica forbids her to do so. Dani and JT catch the mother trying to dig up evidence from the crime scene and take her into custody, whereupon she instantly confesses to the murder. Distraught that his profile might have been wrong, Malcolm visits his therapist Gabrielle, who prompts him to realize that he has blinded himself to the possibility that Isaac is the real killer. His suspicions are confirmed by the mother, and the police race to catch Isaac, who has attacked another man. Malcolm talks him into voluntarily submitting to psychiatric treatment.

Believing that his father may know the killer, Malcolm goes to speak to him at the same time that Ainsley is conducting her interview. At the same time, another patient, Tevin, escapes and stabs his therapist, forcing a lockdown. He manages to break into the secure wing and stab Ainsley's cameraman/boyfriend Jin in the chest before a guard is able to lock him out. With Jin bleeding to death and medics too far away to help, Malcolm attempts emergency surgery but his PTSD gets in the way. With no other options, the guard uncuffs Dr. Whitly so he can perform the procedure instead. Malcolm takes Ainsley's camera and distracts Tevin before subduing him with a taser. The procedure is successful, and Ainsley thanks her father. However, Tevin then confesses that he was manipulated by the doctor to attack Jin, leading to the latter being placed in indefinite solitary confinement.

Enraged, the killer contacts him again demanding to know how he figured it out. Malcolm is able to maintain his composure until the killer mentions the girl in the box, which clouds his judgment and winds up leading him into a trap. The killer gives him a phone and tells him to meet at a certain location if he wants to save a kidnapped priest. Gil is able to save the priest, but Malcolm realizes it was a diversion: the killer goes to the hospital and murders Ryan in his bed. Ainsley spots him and manages to hide before cops arrive. She decides to file a report on the Junkyard Killer; Jin, who has just woken up from surgery, breaks up with her out of disgust for putting her career before him.

Hoping to get a lead, Malcolm poses as a new client and meets Jasper's partner Simone. When questioned, she implies Beth's husband knows something. Malcolm speaks to him and learns that Beth and the victim may have been in love, a direct violation of the club's rules. While out on their date, Eve asks Malcolm to profile her; his answers visually upset her and she leaves. The team subsequently finds Jasper dead in his apartment, and Simone abducted. Putting the pieces together, Malcolm takes them back to Beth's apartment, explaining that she committed the murders out of anger for the victim rejecting her love for him and her fear of being caught.

Swanson has a low opinion of Malcolm and tries to convince Dani to spy on him for her.

As the interview unfolds, Malcolm explains how he defied Gil's instructions by inserting himself into the case of Tristan Johnston, a man with ties to a private specialist running a cult-like institute that claims to cure trauma through electroshock treatments. Malcolm enters the institute seeking help with his condition and meets Andi, a fellow patient who was recruited to the institute by Tristan. Before they can go to the police, however, Andi is abducted. The specialist claims that she was kidnapped by a [[Deprogramming|deprogrammer]], but when a suspect is identified, Malcolm believes that he is not the real culprit. Gil kicks him out of the precinct after an argument, which then triggers the incident.

The MO points towards a killer obsessed with ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' who is inflicting various types of [[poetic justice]] on a series of men linked to the wealthy Taylor family. The team discovers that their only son, Cal Taylor, was involved in the apparent death of a woman named Isabella, which his father had covered up. Gil and Malcolm go to the Taylor estate and catch Ernesto, Isabella's father, but Malcolm is convinced that he wasn't responsible. Shut out of the investigation, he pays a secret visit to his father, who advises him to focus on Cal as a suspect. With Dani posing as a guest, Malcolm crashes the wedding and distracts the guests with a long speech about fathers, in which he exposes the senior Taylor's crimes. Isabella, who survived her \"death\", tries to shoot him but misses, and Dani takes her into custody. Malcolm assures the father he'll answer for his involvement as well. Dr. Whitly eagerly watches Ainsley's coverage of the story, believing that he has finally made a connection with his son.\n |LineColor       = 283633\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 14\n |Title           = Eye of the Needle\n |DirectedBy      = Lisa Robinson\n |WrittenBy       = Wyatt Cain\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|10}}\n |ProdCode        = T88.10114\n |Viewers         = 3.09<ref name=\"1.14\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-10-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 2.10.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=February 11, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate= February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Jessica is contacted by a man who claims to know about the girl in the box, but when she goes to meet him, a body turns up. The killer, keeping his identity secret, calls Ainsley during her first day as a studio anchorwoman and publicly demands that Jessica pay him $1 million not to kill a second victim. Dr. Whitly takes the opportunity to also call in to Ainsley's program and offer his insight that the killer is motivated by a personal grudge against him. Jessica prepares the ransom against Gil's advice and the killer humiliates her by making her dump it on the street while killing the second victim anyway. Malcolm suspects that the killer despises the entire Whitly family and decides that he needs to speak to his father. Jessica shows up as well, and reveals the killer wants her to murder her husband to save another hostage. Malcolm performs the murder instead, specifically aiming not to fatally pierce Dr. Whitly's heart. He and the team intercept the killer, the husband of a patient who died on Dr. Whitly's table, and save the hostage.

Malcolm is then sent to help investigate a mysterious case involving a perfectly embalmed corpse, which he determines was the work of a [[necrophilia|necrophiliac]]. With help from the victim's ex-business partner, Tilda Carp ([[Ana Gasteyer]]), they are able to identify a suspect: Leanne Triutt, a disgraced former morgue worker. Jessica is contacted by Dr. Whitly's sleazy former lawyer, Sterling, who offers to get the charges against her dismissed; on the advice of Ainsley, she instead chooses to reach out to Eve, who agrees to defend her. Malcolm finds himself unwilling to visit his father and argues with Dani and his sister about it. Leanne breaks into the precinct and holds Edrissa at gunpoint, demanding the victim's body. Malcolm distracts her while Edrissa knocks her down with a metal tray just before backup arrives. Inspired by Leanne's words, Malcolm decides to go see Dr. Whitly, who is haunted by a nightmare of the girl in the box.

Based on this information, Malcolm determines that one of the thieves is a thrill killer who derives satisfaction and pleasure from murder. Dr. Whitly blackmails Jessica, demanding that Malcolm visit him weekly or he'll lie and say she tried to kill him. To take her mind off things, Jessica gets her son to call Eve for dinner. Malcolm confesses to her that he is continually haunted by the girl in the box. Vijay makes a secret deal with the gang to buy back the stolen goods, but Malcolm follows him and convinces the gang that he's an appraiser. He uses the opportunity to study them, until his cover is blown and Vijay is sent away while the gang decides what to do with Malcolm. Using his profiling skills, he convinces the gang members to shoot each other out of paranoia and fear, while Vijay shows up and runs down the killer with his car.

Ainsley visits Jessica with a revelation: Eve is biologically related to the girl in the box. Malcolm speaks to Dr. Whitly, who tells him that Nina's mother is diabetic and therefore incapable of having a child without serious complications.

Gil displays signs of jealousy when he discovers Endicott has been romancing Jessica. The team investigates the dancer's ballet company, and learn that the victim fled from Cuba after his mentor was arrested for poisoning several other dancers. Dr. Whitly spends several hours gathering his thoughts and contacts Eve for another visit. Malcolm forms a theory that the mentor, presumed dead while trying to escape Cuba, is still alive; he turns out to be posing as a stagehand and killed his pupil out of fear that he would talk. Malcolm returns to his father with Eve in tow, and learns the truth: Dr. Whitly spared her sister's life after she gave him the name of a powerful man who wanted her dead. Eve departs to find her sister and tells Malcolm to stay out of it.

Arroyo. On his first case, Malcolm discovers similarities between the killer and his father, Martin Whitly, an incarcerated serial killer known as \"The Surgeon\". This causes him to suffer night terrors and panic attacks as he finds himself reliving the events leading up to his father's arrest. Against the advice of Gil and his long-suffering mother Jessica, Malcolm visits his father for the first time in ten years for help identifying the killer, who he determines was one of his patients. Faced with the threat of his son abandoning him for good, Dr. Whitly names the killer as wealthy developer Carter Berkhead. Berkhead takes his wife and a cop, Det. Dani Powell, hostage, and an overwhelmed Malcolm offers to trade his life for theirs, distracting Berkhead long enough for Gil to shoot him. Afterwards, Gil tells his officers the truth of Malcolm's identity and asks them to have faith in him.\n| LineColor       = 283633\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Annihilator\n |DirectedBy      = [[Adam Kane]]\n |WrittenBy       = Chris Fedak & Sam Sklaver\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|30}}\n |ProdCode        = T88.10102\n |Viewers         = 3.90<ref name=\"1.02\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-september-30-2019/|title='The Voice,' 'Dancing with the Stars,' and 'The Good Doctor' adjust down: Monday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 1, 2019|accessdate=October 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001210324/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-september-30-2019/|archive-date=October 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Gil invites Malcolm to consult on a new case involving the poisoning of several family members; snakes found in the body of the dead patriarch points to an estranged son who tries to kill Malcolm with snake venom, which triggers a new memory of Dr. Whitly using [[chloroform]] on his son when he discovers an unconscious woman in a locked box. Ainsley discovers that her brother has been visiting their father. Malcolm goes to see Dr. Whitly, and warns him that he will uncover the truth behind his missing memories. When the suspect is reported dead from suicide, Gil gives his team a few hours to prove Malcolm's theory that he was framed. Malcolm and Dani visit the family lawyer, who admits that he was an illegitimate child rejected by the patriarch and so took revenge by killing his family. He then poisons himself and his wife and daughters, but the cops are able to reverse the poisonings. Dani takes an inebriated Malcolm home that night and helps him into bed.

Based on letters recovered from the victim's body, as well as evidence the man's brain was removed after his death, Malcolm suspects that the killer may be a disgruntled former test subject of Brown's. JT discovers that Brown was illegally dosing her students with [[LSD]], resulting in a suicide that she covered up. Jessica becomes concerned that her son's visits with Dr. Whitly are further damaging his fragile mind; she asks Gil to intervene, but he refuses as he feels Malcolm should make his own choices. Brown identifies the suspect, just as Malcolm realizes that the murders are aimed at wiping out everyone involved with her research. While on stakeout, the killer breaks into Brown's house and drugs her before she shoots him dead; Malcolm convinces her to surrender to the police. Jessica pays a visit to her husband to tell him to stop seeing their son, and he takes the opportunity to try and manipulate her.

A social media [[influencer]] is murdered in a manner that Malcolm identifies as likely being the work of a stalker. Accompanied by JT, he picks up Roger, a photographer who has been following the victim for some time, but refuses to reveal evidence that the police believe he possesses out of fear. After the real killer tries to run him over, Malcolm tricks Roger into thinking he's about to die, causing him to hand over the evidence. This points the team towards Axel X, a designer and the victim's former boyfriend who Malcolm realizes is the actual target. Without a warrant to justify taking action, Malcolm seeks out Axel on his own and gets him to give up the killer: his bodyguard Joey. Joey prepares to kill him, but the police spring a trap at the last second, using a wire Malcolm was wearing to take down both Axel and Joey. Gil provides Malcolm with a recording of his mother's interview following his father's arrest; he seemingly forgives her afterwards for lying to him about her knowledge of his crimes.

Gil locates a potential suspect, a dealer who Dani insists is not the killer. Defying orders, she goes to see him with Malcolm in tow. A shootout occurs, and Malcolm is exposed to hallucinogenic drugs; Dani takes him home and puts him to sleep. Jessica meets Eve Blanchard, an attorney who suggests that she invest her family's money in her work fighting human trafficking. Malcolm has a dream involving his own mind, represented as himself in his father's clothes, and tries to find an old box of photos from his childhood to get answers. Dani then reveals that the dealer saved her life three years ago while she was working undercover. They locate the dealer, save him from the killer (a woman seeking revenge for her daughter's death), and fake his murder so he can start over.

His profile suggests that the killer is a sadist, and he correctly infers that the boy's mother is a \"[[Jocasta]]\", a woman with an unhealthy dependence on her son's companionship. Both Jessica and Malcolm are against Ainsley's plan to interview Dr. Whitly, and Jessica forbids her to do so. Dani and JT catch the mother trying to dig up evidence from the crime scene and take her into custody, whereupon she instantly confesses to the murder. Distraught that his profile might have been wrong, Malcolm visits his therapist Gabrielle, who prompts him to realize that he has blinded himself to the possibility that Isaac is the real killer. His suspicions are confirmed by the mother, and the police race to catch Isaac, who has attacked another man. Malcolm talks him into voluntarily submitting to psychiatric treatment. Ainsley tells her mother that she'll find a way to conduct the interview.

Believing that his father may know the killer, Malcolm goes to speak to him at the same time that Ainsley is conducting her interview. At the same time, another patient, Tevin, escapes and stabs his therapist, forcing a lockdown. He manages to break into the secure wing and stab Ainsley's cameraman/boyfriend Jin in the chest before a guard is able to lock him out. With Jin bleeding to death and medics too far away to help, Malcolm attempts emergency surgery but his PTSD gets in the way. With no other options, the guard uncuffs Dr. Whitly so he can perform the procedure instead. Malcolm takes Ainsley's camera and distracts Tevin before subduing him with a taser. The procedure is successful, and Ainsley thanks her father. However, Tevin then confesses that he was manipulated by the doctor to attack Jin, leading to the latter being placed in indefinite solitary confinement.

Interpreting the man's MO as that of a \"righteous\" killer, Malcolm searches the scrapyard and finds another victim, Ryan Davis, buried alive in a makeshift underground cell. Enraged, the killer contacts him again demanding to know how he figured it out. Malcolm is able to maintain his composure until the killer mentions the girl in the box, which clouds his judgment and winds up leading him into a trap. The killer gives him a phone and tells him to meet at a certain location if he wants to save a kidnapped priest. Gil is able to save the priest, but Malcolm realizes it was a diversion: the killer goes to the hospital and murders Ryan in his bed. Ainsley spots him and manages to hide before cops arrive. She decides to file a report on the Junkyard Killer; Jin, who has just woken up from surgery, breaks up with her out of disgust for putting her career before him. Jessica tells her son that, against his advice, she will not leave her house until the Junkyard Killer is caught.

Hoping to get a lead, Malcolm poses as a new client and meets Jasper's partner Simone. When questioned, she implies Beth's husband knows something. Malcolm speaks to him and learns that Beth and the victim may have been in love, a direct violation of the club's rules. While out on their date, Eve asks Malcolm to profile her; his answers visually upset her and she leaves. The team subsequently finds Jasper dead in his apartment, and Simone abducted. Putting the pieces together, Malcolm takes them back to Beth's apartment, explaining that she committed the murders out of anger for the victim rejecting her love for him and her fear of being caught.

Shannon confronts Malcolm, claiming that he was unfairly dismissed from the force for insisting that there was another killer helping his father. Gil and the rest of the team are left to deal with the FBI, headed up by profiler Colette Swanson ([[Meagan Good]]). Swanson has a low opinion of Malcolm and tries to convince Dani to spy on him for her. As she prepares for [[Christmas]] with her family, Jessica becomes increasingly agitated by the attention being heaped on her husband and decides to announce a reward for any new leads on the girl in the box. Shannon and Malcolm find Turner's secret office, where they realize that he also shared Shannon's concerns and wanted to prove he was right.

Malcolm enters the institute seeking help with his condition and meets Andi, a fellow patient who was recruited to the institute by Tristan.

The MO points towards a killer obsessed with ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' who is inflicting various types of [[poetic justice]] on a series of men linked to the wealthy Taylor family. The team discovers that their only son, Cal Taylor, was involved in the apparent death of a woman named Isabella, which his father had covered up. Gil and Malcolm go to the Taylor estate and catch Ernesto, Isabella's father, but Malcolm is convinced that he wasn't responsible. Shut out of the investigation, he pays a secret visit to his father, who advises him to focus on Cal as a suspect. With Dani posing as a guest, Malcolm crashes the wedding and distracts the guests with a long speech about fathers, in which he exposes the senior Taylor's crimes. Isabella, who survived her \"death\", tries to shoot him but misses, and Dani takes her into custody. Malcolm assures the father he'll answer for his involvement as well.

The killer, keeping his identity secret, calls Ainsley during her first day as a studio anchorwoman and publicly demands that Jessica pay him $1 million not to kill a second victim. Dr. Whitly takes the opportunity to also call in to Ainsley's program and offer his insight that the killer is motivated by a personal grudge against him. Jessica prepares the ransom against Gil's advice and the killer humiliates her by making her dump it on the street while killing the second victim anyway. Malcolm suspects that the killer despises the entire Whitly family and decides that he needs to speak to his father. Jessica shows up as well, and reveals the killer wants her to murder her husband to save another hostage. Malcolm performs the murder instead, specifically aiming not to fatally pierce Dr. Whitly's heart. He and the team intercept the killer, the husband of a patient who died on Dr. Whitly's table, and save the hostage.

Malcolm is then sent to help investigate a mysterious case involving a perfectly embalmed corpse, which he determines was the work of a [[necrophilia|necrophiliac]]. With help from the victim's ex-business partner, Tilda Carp ([[Ana Gasteyer]]), they are able to identify a suspect: Leanne Triutt, a disgraced former morgue worker. Jessica is contacted by Dr. Whitly's sleazy former lawyer, Sterling, who offers to get the charges against her dismissed; on the advice of Ainsley, she instead chooses to reach out to Eve, who agrees to defend her. Malcolm finds himself unwilling to visit his father and argues with Dani and his sister about it. Leanne breaks into the precinct and holds Edrissa at gunpoint, demanding the victim's body. Malcolm distracts her while Edrissa knocks her down with a metal tray just before backup arrives. Inspired by Leanne's words, Malcolm decides to go see Dr. Whitly, who is haunted by a nightmare of the girl in the box.

Based on this information, Malcolm determines that one of the thieves is a thrill killer who derives satisfaction and pleasure from murder. Dr. Whitly blackmails Jessica, demanding that Malcolm visit him weekly or he'll lie and say she tried to kill him. To take her mind off things, Jessica gets her son to call Eve for dinner. Malcolm confesses to her that he is continually haunted by the girl in the box. Vijay makes a secret deal with the gang to buy back the stolen goods, but Malcolm follows him and convinces the gang that he's an appraiser. He uses the opportunity to study them, until his cover is blown and Vijay is sent away while the gang decides what to do with Malcolm. Using his profiling skills, he convinces the gang members to shoot each other out of paranoia and fear, while Vijay shows up and runs down the killer with his car.

Ainsley visits Jessica with a revelation: Eve is biologically related to the girl in the box. Malcolm speaks to Dr. Whitly, who tells him that Nina's mother is diabetic and therefore incapable of having a child without serious complications. It turns out the pregnancy was faked, and that Nina's real mother is the family nanny, Christine. Jessica and Ainsley visit Malcolm at the same time Eve comes by to explain herself; struggling with his emotions, Malcolm puts his full focus on the case. He learns from Christine that her abusive ex-husband is Nina's father and determined to take her back, so he sets a trap and takes him into custody.

A ballet dancer who defected from [[Cuba]] is poisoned while performing at a party hosted by wealthy socialite Nicholas Endicott. Gil displays signs of jealousy when he discovers Endicott has been romancing Jessica. The team investigates the dancer's ballet company, and learn that the victim fled from Cuba after his mentor was arrested for poisoning several other dancers. Dr. Whitly spends several hours gathering his thoughts and contacts Eve for another visit. Malcolm forms a theory that the mentor, presumed dead while trying to escape Cuba, is still alive; he turns out to be posing as a stagehand and killed his pupil out of fear that he would talk. Malcolm returns to his father with Eve in tow, and learns the truth: Dr. Whitly spared her sister's life after she gave him the name of a powerful man who wanted her dead. Eve departs to find her sister and tells Malcolm to stay out of it.
