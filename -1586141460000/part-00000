The character first appeared in ''San Diego Comic-Con Comics'' #2 (August [[1993 in comics|1993]]), and has since appeared in various [[eponym]]ous [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]], [[one-shot (comics)|one-shots]] and [[intercompany crossover]]s. The character has been adapted into three live-action feature films. Two starring [[Ron Perlman]] in [[Hellboy (2004 film)|2004]] and [[Hellboy II: The Golden Army|2008]] in the title role, and one in [[Hellboy (2019 film)|2019]] which starred [[David Harbour]], as well as two [[Hellboy Animated|straight-to-DVD animated films]], and three video games \u2013 ''[[Hellboy: Asylum Seeker|Asylum Seeker]]'', ''[[Hellboy: The Science of Evil|The Science of Evil]]'', and as a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]''.\n\nA well-meaning half-[[Demon]] (or [[Cambion]]) whose true name is '''Anung Un Rama''' (\"and upon his brow is set a crown of flame\"), Hellboy was summoned from [[Hell]] to [[Earth]] as a baby by [[Occultism in Nazism|Nazi occultists]] (spawning his hatred for the [[Third Reich]]). He was discovered on a fictional [[Outer Hebrides]] Island by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]]; amongst them, Professor Trevor Bruttenholm, who formed the United States [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense]] (B.P.R.D.). In time, Hellboy grew to be a large, red-skinned adult with a tail, horns (which he files off, leaving behind circular stumps on his forehead), cloven hooves for feet, and an oversized right hand made of stone (the \"Right Hand of Doom\"). He has been described as smelling of dry-roasted [[peanut]]s. Although a bit gruff, he shows none of the malevolence thought to be intrinsic to classical demons and has an ironic sense of humor. This is said to be because of his upbringing under Professor Bruttenholm, who raised him as a normal boy.\n\nHellboy works for the [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense|B.P.R.D.]], an international non-governmental agency, and for himself against dark forces including [[Nazism|Nazis]] and [[witches]], in a series of tales that have their roots in [[folklore]], [[pulp magazine]]s, vintage adventure, [[Lovecraftian horror]] and [[horror fiction]]. In earlier stories, he is identified as the \"World's Greatest Paranormal Investigator\".\n\nIn 2011, Hellboy was ranked 25th of the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes by [[IGN]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/25|title=Hellboy \u2013 #25 Top Comic Book Heroes|website=IGN|language=en|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{long plot|date=July 2017}}\nHellboy, or \"Anung Un Rama\" as he was called, was conceived on October 5,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thecomicbug.com/2011/08/20/mike-mignola-exclusive-hellboy-fury-print-at-the-comic-bug | title=Mike Mignola Exclusive Hellboy Fury Print at The Comic Bug! | accessdate=2011-10-06 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425051033/http://thecomicbug.com/2011/08/20/mike-mignola-exclusive-hellboy-fury-print-at-the-comic-bug/ | archivedate=2012-04-25 }}</ref> 1617, the day his birth-mother, Sarah Hughes, a [[human]] woman, was on her deathbed. In life, Sarah was a witch who gained her powers from being a consort of the [[archdemon]], Azzael<!-- Hellboy's father is called in comic Azzael, not Azazel. -->, an [[Archduke]] of Hell, and Hellboy's \"biological\" father. Taking Sarah's body to hell when she attempted to repent on her deathbed within a church in [[East Bromwich]], [[England]], Azzael burned her away so their child would be born, and chopped off the newborn's right hand to replace it with the \"Right Hand of Doom\", a relic tied to the [[Ogdru Jahad]]. When the other princes of Hell learned of his actions, Azzael sent his half-demon child away while he was stripped of his powers and imprisoned in ice (like [[Lucifer]] in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'').\n\nThe child is eventually summoned to Earth in the final months of [[World War II]] by the \"Mad Monk\" [[Grigori Rasputin (Hellboy)|Grigori Rasputin]] on Tarmagant Island, off the coast of [[Scotland]], having been commissioned by the [[Nazism and occultism|Nazis]] to change the tide of a losing war (\"[[Project Ragna Rok]]\"). As a direct result of this ritual, the child appears on Earth in a fireball at what remains of the ruined Bromwich Church on December 23, 1944. Proving not to be a [[devil]], in the traditional sense, but a devil-like creature, the child was dubbed \"Hellboy\" by Professor Trevor \"Broom\" Bruttenholm.<ref>''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]''. (2004)</ref>\n\nTaken by the [[United States Armed Forces]] to an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] base in [[New Mexico]], Hellboy is raised by Professor Trevor Bruttenholm in as normal a home environment as possible (and as a [[Catholic]]), and the [[United States Army]] where the [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense]] (BPRD) a private organization dedicated to combating [[occult]] threats, begins. Due to the success of his first mission in 1952, Hellboy is granted \"honorary human\" status by the [[United Nations]] and becomes a member of the BPRD as the \"world's greatest paranormal investigator\".<ref>''Hellboy and the B.P.R.D.: 1952 #5''. (2015)</ref> As such, Hellboy interacts regularly with humans, primarily law enforcement officials, the military, and various \"scholars of the weird\", most of whom are not presented as overtly reacting to his strange appearance.\n\nAs an adult, having matured physically within years yet aging slowly with a teenaged mind, Hellboy becomes the primary agent for the BPRD, alongside other human and quasi-human agents that include [[Kate Corrigan]], a professor of [[folklore]] at [[New York University]]; [[Abe Sapien]], an [[amphibian]] [[humanoid]] (''Ichthyo sapiens''); and [[Liz Sherman]], a young [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]]. Things change dramatically for Hellboy during the events of ''[[Hellboy: Seed of Destruction|Seed of Destruction]]'' when he searches for Professor Bruttenholm after he disappears during an expedition in the Arctic. He finds his adopted father only to witness his death at the hands of a Lovecraftian frog monster. The search takes Hellboy, Abe, and Liz to the Cavendish Hall mansion, which is a trap established by Rasputin to lure Hellboy into an embrace of his own \"destiny\", with the assistance of Sadu-Hem; one of the spawn of the Ogdru Jahad. Controlled by the spirit of one of the ancestral Cavendish men, Abe impales Rasputin. Liz's firestorm then incinerates Rasputin's body alongside Sadu-Hem's and destroys Cavendish Hall. Soon after, during a visit to Bromwich Church, Hellboy gets a glimpse of his conception 300+ years ago and learns he has two human half-siblings; a nun and a priest whose spirits haunt the church after their deaths, attempting to stop Azzael from claiming Sarah.\n\nDuring the events of ''[[Hellboy: Wake the Devil]]'', Hellboy's journey of self-discovery leads him to Romania to investigate the theft of an ancient box containing the corpse of Vladimir Giurescu, a Napoleonic officer who was, in fact, a vampire before he was \"killed\" on the order of a fearful Adolf Hitler. The culprit of the theft is revealed to be Ilsa Haupstein, one of the surviving members of Project Ragna Rok, who was revived from suspended animation and then aided in Giurescu's resurrection. Finding Castle Giurescu after splitting up with the other search groups, Hellboy learns that the source of Giurescu's rebirth is the ancient goddess [[Hecate]]. Though Hellboy destroys Hecate's original body, he faces her again after Rasputin unintentionally provides her with Ilsa's iron-maiden encased body. Hecate swallows Hellboy, but he returns to his own reality after he denounces the dark purpose he was born to perform.\n\nHellboy later learns that Liz is dying after losing her powers when she accidentally revived a homunculus while searching another location for Giurescu, finding [[Roger (Hellboy)|Roger]] in the events of ''[[Hellboy: Almost Colossus]]'' as he convinces the homunculus to save Liz's life. Following the events of ''[[Hellboy: The Right Hand of Doom#The Right Hand of Doom|Hellboy: The Right Hand of Doom]]'', gaining insight about his stone hand and being referenced as a harbinger of the Apocalypse, Hellboy is accompanied by Abe to hunt down the warlock Igor Bromhead in ''Box Full of Evil''. But it turned out to be a trap conducted by Bromhead and the demon Ualac to capture Hellboy so that the latter can claim Hellboy's normally invisible Crown of the Apocalypse to increase their power. But this act, however, proves to be counter-productive, as it allows Hellboy to no-longer be controlled by his true name, '''Anung Un Rama''' (as one of the translations of this name is, lit. \"and upon his brow is set a crown of flame\"; with the theft of his crown, the name is no longer accurate), and he kills Ualac's mortal body before the demon and the crown is taken to Hell by the archdemon, Astaroth, who is later revealed to be Hellboy's paternal uncle.\n\nIn the aftermath of ''[[Hellboy: Conqueror Worm]]'', assisted by the ghost of [[Lobster Johnson]], Roger, and Abe, a disillusioned Hellboy resigns from the Bureau before it later gains new agents in [[Johann Kraus]], the spirit of a German medium kept in a containment suit; and Captain [[Ben Daimio]], a [[special operations]] soldier that became an [[Olmec were-jaguar]]. From there, Hellboy decides to find out the truth of his existence once and for all. But, as revealed in ''[[Hellboy: Strange Places]]'', Hellboy ends up being stranded on an island where he inadvertently resurrected an ancient mystic who gained knowledge of the secret history of the creation of Ogdru Jahad and the Right Hand of Doom.\n\n6 years later, as ''[[Hellboy: Darkness Calls]]'' opens, Hellboy's search takes him to England where he finds himself in the middle of a power vacuum caused by Bromhead incapacitating Hecate in Italy. Refusing to serve the witches as their king, Hellboy ends up in the dimension of [[Baba Yaga (Hellboy)|Baba Yaga]], a witch whom he encountered in the past and happens to be an ally of Rasputin's. Managing to defeat Baba Yaga's champion Koshchei, Hellboy returns to his reality and is led to Bromhead after he became monstrous and in agony from his attempt to take Hecate's powers for his own. Hellboy gives Bromhead a merciful death before returning to England during the events of ''[[Hellboy: The Wild Hunt]]'' where he encounters Alice Monaghan, a young woman he saved as a baby from a fairy named Gruagach who has revived the lunatic sorceress Nimue to fill the void left by Hecate.\n\nDuring that time, Hellboy encounters the spirit of [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana le Fay]] who reveals to Hellboy both the names of his parents and that Sarah Hughes was her descendant, which names Hellboy as the last living heir to [[Arthur Pendragon]] and the rightful king of England.<ref>''Hellboy: The Wild Hunt'' #6</ref> But as he also learns from Astaroth that he is destined to kill [[Satan]] and become the new King of Hell, Hellboy is reluctant to wield [[Excalibur]] (which in his hands becomes a [[Flaming sword (mythology)|flaming sword]]) and the army of undead British nobility amassed to face Nimue's army. Therefore, enlisting Baba Yaga's assistance with his eye as payment for the injury he did to her in their first meeting, Hellboy decides to face Nimue one-on-one in the events of ''[[Hellboy: The Storm and the Fury]]''. But in the aftermath of his battle with Nimue, who was possessed by Ogdru Jahad at the time, Hellboy is killed by the witch in her final moments. As revealed in ''[[#Issues: Hellboy in Hell|Hellboy in Hell]]'', Hellboy ends up trapped in Hell, where he encounters what's left of his demonic kin and the souls of the damned, and ultimately comes to terms with the destiny he has been shrugging off his whole life. Hellboy later returns in the mini-series ''BPRD: The Devil You Know,'' revived and joining Liz and Abe in the final arc of the series. After defeating Rasputin again, he and Hecate see the fall of the Ogdru Jahad and get back the Right Hand of Doom from the Osiris Club, killing them. Despite their efforts, however, Ragnarok is fulfilled and most of humanity is destroyed.  In the end, Hellboy and Hecate fuse together to create a new world on Earth.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAfforded by his demonic heritage as well as extensive physical training and bodybuilding, Hellboy possesses superhuman strength that exceeds the 1-ton base limit, endurance, a degree of resistance to injury, and a [[healing factor]] that allows him to heal quickly from virtually all bodily injuries as well as renders him immune to all diseases. He also has the innate ability to comprehend ancient and magical languages. The extent of his strength is unclear, but he has torn down a large tree and hurled it at an opponent and has lifted massive stones. He has also picked up and thrown opponents weighing at least four to five hundred pounds. Hellboy has a high degree of resilience to injury. He can withstand powerful blows that would severely injure or kill a human. He survived being shot many times in the chest with an [[MG 42]] machine gun before destroying it.<ref>''The Lost Army''</ref> He has survived being impaled through the chest with a sword, severe werewolf mauling, being beaten unconscious with heavy iron tongs, falling from extreme heights, being crushed by boulders, and more. In the film version, it is stated that Hellboy is immune to all forms of fire and burns, including Liz Sherman's flames, and electrocution. Despite his ability to quickly recover from seemingly mortal wounds, he is far from invulnerable and can be injured or bloodied by conventional weapons. It is revealed to [[Baba Yaga]] by the dead Russian nobility that Hellboy may not be slain even through supernatural means and that he appears to be as deathless as her warrior, [[Koschei]] the Deathless.<ref>''Hellboy: Darkness Calls''</ref> In the films, Hellboy has shown skill in [[necromancy]], animating a man's dead body so that it could give him directions.\n\nHellboy ages very differently from humans. In the story ''Pancakes'' he is two years old but appears to be somewhere between 6 and 10 human years old. In ''Nature of the Beast'', set in 1954, the ten-year-old Hellboy appears fully grown. His rapid physical maturation is in contrast to his actual rate of aging, however, which seems to be much slower than humans. Throughout the sixty-year span of time depicted in the comics, he does not age beyond the plateau of physical maturity. This mystical aging process is similar to the other demons and supernatural beings that populate Hellboy's world. The lifespan of a demon or half-demon as Hellboy's mother was human, are left undefined within the comics and seem to range from decades to many thousands of years. In the movies, Hellboy's aging process is described by BRPD as \"reverse [[List of unusual units of measurement#Dog year|dog years]]\".\n\nIn addition to his natural physical abilities, Hellboy carries a variety of items in his utility belt and jacket that can be used against various supernatural forces. He has been known to carry [[holy relic]]s, horseshoes, various herbs, and [[hand grenade]]s. Though he commonly carries an oversized revolver, which in the Guillermo del Toro films was named the \"[[Good Samaritan]]\", and which was forged from the recycled iron from a [[church bell]]; Hellboy freely admits, however, to being a lousy shot with it, and often favors fighting [[Hand-to-hand combat|hand-to-hand]], preferring to use short-ranged physical weapons like swords, spears, and his massive stone fist over firearms. Hellboy's lack of formal combat training and education is compensated for by his decades of experience as a paranormal investigator, though encounters with unfamiliar threats have often forced him to resort to improvisation and using his wits.\n\n===Right Hand of Doom===\nAs revealed in ''Strange Places'', Hellboy's right hand was originally the right hand of Anum, one of the \"greater spirits\" that watched over the burgeoning Earth and created the [[Ogdru Jahad]]. After sealing the Ogdru Jahad away, Anum was destroyed by his fellow spirits. Only his right hand remained intact as it was kept and preserved by many races throughout history, including the first race of man. The Right Hand of Doom eventually ended up in the possession of Azzael before he grafted it onto the newborn Hellboy.\n\nAs the hand which created and bound the Ogdru Jahad, it is also the key that will \"loose and command\" them; in other words, it is a catalyst that will bring about [[Ragnarok]]. The comic books themselves never mention how the Right Hand of Doom would actually perform these tasks; they only explain this is the case and someone or something intends to do it, with or without Hellboy's consent. The film shows it working as a key: being turned twice in a special obelisk secured by Rasputin would release the Ogdru Jahad. It is made clear it is not necessary for the arm to be attached to Hellboy to perform its duties. It has been suggested if Hellboy dies while the Hand is attached to him, it would become useless. He has, therefore, concluded the only way to prevent its falling into the wrong hands is to keep and protect it.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nHellboy originated with a drawing [[Mike Mignola]] did at a [[comic book convention]] of a demon with the name \"Hellboy\" written on his belt. Mignola had initially no intention of doing anything serious with the concept, but eventually decided he liked the name.<ref name=\"Back21\">{{cite journal|last= Irving|first= Christopher|date= April 2007|title= The Genesis of Hellboy|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 21|pages= 3\u20135}}</ref>\n\nLater, Mignola became interested in doing a creator-owned comic, as he felt it made more sense to create his own characters for the stories he wanted to tell, rather than trying to shoehorn existing characters into these stories. Mignola elaborated, \"The kinds of stories I wanted to do I had in mind before I created Hellboy. It\u2019s not like I created Hellboy and said, 'Hey, now what does this guy do?' I knew the kinds of stories I wanted to do, but just needed a main guy.\" He initially created Hellboy as part of a team of five, but scrapped this idea when he realized he could not think of any team names that he liked.<ref name=\"Back21\"/>\n\nMuch like other American comic book superheroes such as [[Batman]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Iron Man]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]], Hellboy is constantly tormented by the knowledge of his past. One example being in ''Wake the Devil'' where he describes his mindset since the aftermath of ''Seed of Destruction'' by saying, \"I ''like'' not knowing. I've gotten by for fifty-two years without knowing. I sleep good ''not knowing''.\"\n\n==Publication history==\n{{See also|List of Hellboy comics}}\nBefore ''Hellboy'' was published independently at Dark Horse Comics, the concept was initially pitched to a board of directors for [[DC Comics]], who loved it, but did not like the idea of it involving \"Hell\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bamkapow.com/hellboy2-tokens.php |title=Hellboy II: The Golden Army |work=Bam!

The increasing commitments from the ''Hellboy'' franchise meant that the 2008 [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''In the Chapel of Moloch'' was the first ''Hellboy'' comic Mignola had provided the script and art for since ''The Island'' in 2005.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18580 | title=Going to the Chapel: Mignola Returns to Drawing ''Hellboy'' | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=October 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Issues===\n''Hellboy'' has an internal numbering on the inside cover of its issues.

Dark Horse Books. {{ISBN|1-59582-567-3}}.\n\n===Other appearances===\nBeyond the ''Hellboy'' comic and its associated spin-offs, Hellboy has made appearances in other publications:\n\n====Great Salt Lake Comic-Con pamphlet====\nThe character name \"Hell Boy\" was included in a drawing by Mike Mignola of a demon character in a black and white illustration, with the later recognized name appearing on the demon's belt buckle. This image, accompanied by a short biography of Mike Mignola and his latest creation, appeared in the pamphlet in 1991. It is the first published mention of the later recognized name. This image was reprinted in'' The Art of Hellboy''. This image was also used to create the \u201cFirst Hellboy\u201d statue by Mondo Tees, in both black and white and full color.\n\n====''Dime Press''====\nA prototype incarnation of Hellboy appeared on the cover of ''Dime Press'' #4 (Glamour International Production, 1993), an obscure Italian fanzine, with \"Hellboy\u00a9Mignola 93\" written at the bottom of the cover. The cover, illustrated by Mignola and by the Italian artist [[Nicola Mari]], show Hellboy in the act of attacking a \"diabolic\" version of the Italian SF comic book character [[Nathan Never]] (with bat wings and pointed tail). Mari at the time was one of the artists that worked on Nathan Never, and the first two years of the life of this comic were the main topic of the fanzine. With the exception of the cover, there is no other mention of Hellboy within the fanzine.

The character first appeared in ''San Diego Comic-Con Comics'' #2 (August [[1993 in comics|1993]]), and has since appeared in various [[eponym]]ous [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]], [[one-shot (comics)|one-shots]] and [[intercompany crossover]]s. The character has been adapted into three live-action feature films. Two starring [[Ron Perlman]] in [[Hellboy (2004 film)|2004]] and [[Hellboy II: The Golden Army|2008]] in the title role, and one in [[Hellboy (2019 film)|2019]] which starred [[David Harbour]], as well as two [[Hellboy Animated|straight-to-DVD animated films]], and three video games \u2013 ''[[Hellboy: Asylum Seeker|Asylum Seeker]]'', ''[[Hellboy: The Science of Evil|The Science of Evil]]'', and as a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]''.\n\nA well-meaning half-[[Demon]] (or [[Cambion]]) whose true name is '''Anung Un Rama''' (\"and upon his brow is set a crown of flame\"), Hellboy was summoned from [[Hell]] to [[Earth]] as a baby by [[Occultism in Nazism|Nazi occultists]] (spawning his hatred for the [[Third Reich]]). He was discovered on a fictional [[Outer Hebrides]] Island by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]]; amongst them, Professor Trevor Bruttenholm, who formed the United States [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense]] (B.P.R.D.). In time, Hellboy grew to be a large, red-skinned adult with a tail, horns (which he files off, leaving behind circular stumps on his forehead), cloven hooves for feet, and an oversized right hand made of stone (the \"Right Hand of Doom\"). He has been described as smelling of dry-roasted [[peanut]]s. Although a bit gruff, he shows none of the malevolence thought to be intrinsic to classical demons and has an ironic sense of humor. This is said to be because of his upbringing under Professor Bruttenholm, who raised him as a normal boy.\n\nHellboy works for the [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense|B.P.R.D.]], an international non-governmental agency, and for himself against dark forces including [[Nazism|Nazis]] and [[witches]], in a series of tales that have their roots in [[folklore]], [[pulp magazine]]s, vintage adventure, [[Lovecraftian horror]] and [[horror fiction]]. In earlier stories, he is identified as the \"World's Greatest Paranormal Investigator\".\n\nIn 2011, Hellboy was ranked 25th of the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes by [[IGN]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/25|title=Hellboy - #25 Top Comic Book Heroes|website=IGN|language=en|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{long plot|date=July 2017}}\nHellboy, or \"Anung Un Rama\" as he was called, was conceived on October 5,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thecomicbug.com/2011/08/20/mike-mignola-exclusive-hellboy-fury-print-at-the-comic-bug | title=Mike Mignola Exclusive Hellboy Fury Print at The Comic Bug! | accessdate=2011-10-06 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425051033/http://thecomicbug.com/2011/08/20/mike-mignola-exclusive-hellboy-fury-print-at-the-comic-bug/ | archivedate=2012-04-25 }}</ref> 1617, the day his birth-mother, Sarah Hughes, a [[human]] woman, was on her deathbed. In life, Sarah was a witch who gained her powers from being a consort of the [[archdemon]], Azzael<!-- Hellboy's father is called in comic Azzael, not Azazel. -->, an [[Archduke]] of Hell, and Hellboy's \"biological\" father. Taking Sarah's body to hell when she attempted to repent on her deathbed within a church in [[East Bromwich]], [[England]], Azzael burned her away so their child would be born, and chopped off the newborn's right hand to replace it with the \"Right Hand of Doom\", a relic tied to the [[Ogdru Jahad]]. When the other princes of Hell learned of his actions, Azzael sent his half-demon child away while he was stripped of his powers and imprisoned in ice (like [[Lucifer]] in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'').\n\nThe child is eventually summoned to Earth in the final months of [[World War II]] by the \"Mad Monk\" [[Grigori Rasputin (Hellboy)|Grigori Rasputin]] on Tarmagant Island, off the coast of [[Scotland]], having been commissioned by the [[Nazism and occultism|Nazis]] to change the tide of a losing war (\"[[Project Ragna Rok]]\"). As a direct result of this ritual, the child appears on Earth in a fireball at what remains of the ruined Bromwich Church on December 23, 1944. Proving not to be a [[devil]], in the traditional sense, but a devil-like creature, the child was dubbed \"Hellboy\" by Professor Trevor \"Broom\" Bruttenholm.<ref>''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]''. (2004)</ref>\n\nTaken by the [[United States Armed Forces]] to an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] base in [[New Mexico]], Hellboy is raised by Professor Trevor Bruttenholm in as normal a home environment as possible (and as a [[Catholic]]), and the [[United States Army]] where the [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense]] (BPRD) a private organization dedicated to combating [[occult]] threats, begins. Due to the success of his first mission in 1952, Hellboy is granted \"honorary human\" status by the [[United Nations]] and becomes a member of the BPRD as the \"world's greatest paranormal investigator\".<ref>''Hellboy and the B.P.R.D.: 1952 #5''. (2015)</ref> As such, Hellboy interacts regularly with humans, primarily law enforcement officials, the military, and various \"scholars of the weird\", most of whom are not presented as overtly reacting to his strange appearance.\n\nAs an adult, having matured physically within years yet aging slowly with a teenaged mind, Hellboy becomes the primary agent for the BPRD, alongside other human and quasi-human agents that include [[Kate Corrigan]], a professor of [[folklore]] at [[New York University]]; [[Abe Sapien]], an [[amphibian]] [[humanoid]] (''Ichthyo sapiens''); and [[Liz Sherman]], a young [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]]. Things change dramatically for Hellboy during the events of ''[[Hellboy: Seed of Destruction|Seed of Destruction]]'' when he searches for Professor Bruttenholm after he disappears during an expedition in the Arctic. He finds his adopted father only to witness his death at the hands of a Lovecraftian frog monster. The search takes Hellboy, Abe, and Liz to the Cavendish Hall mansion, which is a trap established by Rasputin to lure Hellboy into an embrace of his own \"destiny\", with the assistance of Sadu-Hem; one of the spawn of the Ogdru Jahad. Controlled by the spirit of one of the ancestral Cavendish men, Abe impales Rasputin. Liz's firestorm then incinerates Rasputin's body alongside Sadu-Hem's and destroys Cavendish Hall. Soon after, during a visit to Bromwich Church, Hellboy gets a glimpse of his conception 300+ years ago and learns he has two human half-siblings; a nun and a priest whose spirits haunt the church after their deaths, attempting to stop Azzael from claiming Sarah.\n\nDuring the events of ''[[Hellboy: Wake the Devil]]'', Hellboy's journey of self-discovery leads him to Romania to investigate the theft of an ancient box containing the corpse of Vladimir Giurescu, a Napoleonic officer who was, in fact, a vampire before he was \"killed\" on the order of a fearful Adolf Hitler. The culprit of the theft is revealed to be Ilsa Haupstein, one of the surviving members of Project Ragna Rok, who was revived from suspended animation and then aided in Giurescu's resurrection. Finding Castle Giurescu after splitting up with the other search groups, Hellboy learns that the source of Giurescu's rebirth is the ancient goddess [[Hecate]]. Though Hellboy destroys Hecate's original body, he faces her again after Rasputin unintentionally provides her with Ilsa's iron-maiden encased body. Hecate swallows Hellboy, but he returns to his own reality after he denounces the dark purpose he was born to perform.\n\nHellboy later learns that Liz is dying after losing her powers when she accidentally revived a homunculus while searching another location for Giurescu, finding [[Roger (Hellboy)|Roger]] in the events of ''[[Hellboy: Almost Colossus]]'' as he convinces the homunculus to save Liz's life. Following the events of ''[[Hellboy: The Right Hand of Doom#The Right Hand of Doom|Hellboy: The Right Hand of Doom]]'', gaining insight about his stone hand and being referenced as a harbinger of the Apocalypse, Hellboy is accompanied by Abe to hunt down the warlock Igor Bromhead in ''Box Full of Evil''. But it turned out to be a trap conducted by Bromhead and the demon Ualac to capture Hellboy so that the latter can claim Hellboy's normally invisible Crown of the Apocalypse to increase their power. But this act, however, proves to be counter-productive, as it allows Hellboy to no-longer be controlled by his true name, '''Anung Un Rama''' (as one of the translations of this name is, lit. \"and upon his brow is set a crown of flame\"; with the theft of his crown, the name is no longer accurate), and he kills Ualac's mortal body before the demon and the crown is taken to Hell by the archdemon, Astaroth, who is later revealed to be Hellboy's paternal uncle.\n\nIn the aftermath of ''[[Hellboy: Conqueror Worm]]'', assisted by the ghost of [[Lobster Johnson]], Roger, and Abe, a disillusioned Hellboy resigns from the Bureau before it later gains new agents in [[Johann Kraus]], the spirit of a German medium kept in a containment suit; and Captain [[Ben Daimio]], a [[special operations]] soldier that became an [[Olmec were-jaguar]]. From there, Hellboy decides to find out the truth of his existence once and for all. But, as revealed in ''[[Hellboy: Strange Places]]'', Hellboy ends up being stranded on an island where he inadvertently resurrected an ancient mystic who gained knowledge of the secret history of the creation of Ogdru Jahad and the Right Hand of Doom.\n\n6 years later, as ''[[Hellboy: Darkness Calls]]'' opens, Hellboy's search takes him to England where he finds himself in the middle of a power vacuum caused by Bromhead incapacitating Hecate in Italy. Refusing to serve the witches as their king, Hellboy ends up in the dimension of [[Baba Yaga (Hellboy)|Baba Yaga]], a witch whom he encountered in the past and happens to be an ally of Rasputin's. Managing to defeat Baba Yaga's champion Koshchei, Hellboy returns to his reality and is led to Bromhead after he became monstrous and in agony from his attempt to take Hecate's powers for his own. Hellboy gives Bromhead a merciful death before returning to England during the events of ''[[Hellboy: The Wild Hunt]]'' where he encounters Alice Monaghan, a young woman he saved as a baby from a fairy named Gruagach who has revived the lunatic sorceress Nimue to fill the void left by Hecate.\n\nDuring that time, Hellboy encounters the spirit of [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana le Fay]] who reveals to Hellboy both the names of his parents and that Sarah Hughes was her descendant, which names Hellboy as the last living heir to [[Arthur Pendragon]] and the rightful king of England.<ref>''Hellboy: The Wild Hunt'' #6</ref> But as he also learns from Astaroth that he is destined to kill [[Satan]] and become the new King of Hell, Hellboy is reluctant to wield [[Excalibur]] (which in his hands becomes a [[Flaming sword (mythology)|flaming sword]]) and the army of undead British nobility amassed to face Nimue's army. Therefore, enlisting Baba Yaga's assistance with his eye as payment for the injury he did to her in their first meeting, Hellboy decides to face Nimue one-on-one in the events of ''[[Hellboy: The Storm and the Fury]]''. But in the aftermath of his battle with Nimue, who was possessed by Ogdru Jahad at the time, Hellboy is killed by the witch in her final moments. As revealed in ''[[#Issues: Hellboy in Hell|Hellboy in Hell]]'', Hellboy ends up trapped in Hell, where he encounters what's left of his demonic kin and the souls of the damned, and ultimately comes to terms with the destiny he has been shrugging off his whole life. Hellboy later returns in the mini-series ''BPRD: The Devil You Know,'' revived and joining Liz and Abe in the final arc of the series. After defeating Rasputin again, he and Hecate see the fall of the Ogdru Jahad and get back the Right Hand of Doom from the Osiris Club, killing them. Despite their efforts, however, Ragnarok is fulfilled and most of humanity is destroyed.  In the end, Hellboy and Hecate fuse together to create a new world on Earth.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAfforded by his demonic heritage as well as extensive physical training and bodybuilding, Hellboy possesses superhuman strength that exceeds the 1-ton base limit, endurance, a degree of resistance to injury, and a [[healing factor]] that allows him to heal quickly from virtually all bodily injuries as well as renders him immune to all diseases. He also has the innate ability to comprehend ancient and magical languages. The extent of his strength is unclear, but he has torn down a large tree and hurled it at an opponent and has lifted massive stones. He has also picked up and thrown opponents weighing at least four to five hundred pounds. Hellboy has a high degree of resilience to injury. He can withstand powerful blows that would severely injure or kill a human. He survived being shot many times in the chest with an [[MG 42]] machine gun before destroying it.<ref>''The Lost Army''</ref> He has survived being impaled through the chest with a sword, severe werewolf mauling, being beaten unconscious with heavy iron tongs, falling from extreme heights, being crushed by boulders, and more. In the film version, it is stated that Hellboy is immune to all forms of fire and burns, including Liz Sherman's flames, and electrocution. Despite his ability to quickly recover from seemingly mortal wounds, he is far from invulnerable and can be injured or bloodied by conventional weapons. It is revealed to [[Baba Yaga]] by the dead Russian nobility that Hellboy may not be slain even through supernatural means and that he appears to be as deathless as her warrior, [[Koschei]] the Deathless.<ref>''Hellboy: Darkness Calls''</ref> In the films, Hellboy has shown skill in [[necromancy]], animating a man's dead body so that it could give him directions.\n\nHellboy ages very differently from humans. In the story ''Pancakes'' he is two years old but appears to be somewhere between 6 and 10 human years old. In ''Nature of the Beast'', set in 1954, the ten-year-old Hellboy appears fully grown. His rapid physical maturation is in contrast to his actual rate of aging, however, which seems to be much slower than humans. Throughout the sixty-year span of time depicted in the comics, he does not age beyond the plateau of physical maturity. This mystical aging process is similar to the other demons and supernatural beings that populate Hellboy's world. The lifespan of a demon or half-demon as Hellboy's mother was human, are left undefined within the comics and seem to range from decades to many thousands of years. In the movies, Hellboy's aging process is described by BRPD as \"reverse [[List of unusual units of measurement#Dog year|dog years]]\".\n\nIn addition to his natural physical abilities, Hellboy carries a variety of items in his utility belt and jacket that can be used against various supernatural forces. He has been known to carry [[holy relic]]s, horseshoes, various herbs, and [[hand grenade]]s. Though he commonly carries an oversized revolver, which in the Guillermo del Toro films was named the \"[[Good Samaritan]]\", and which was forged from the recycled iron from a [[church bell]]; Hellboy freely admits, however, to being a lousy shot with it, and often favors fighting [[Hand-to-hand combat|hand-to-hand]], preferring to use short-ranged physical weapons like swords, spears, and his massive stone fist over firearms. Hellboy's lack of formal combat training and education is compensated for by his decades of experience as a paranormal investigator, though encounters with unfamiliar threats have often forced him to resort to improvisation and using his wits.\n\n===Right Hand of Doom===\nAs revealed in ''Strange Places'', Hellboy's right hand was originally the right hand of Anum, one of the \"greater spirits\" that watched over the burgeoning Earth and created the [[Ogdru Jahad]]. After sealing the Ogdru Jahad away, Anum was destroyed by his fellow spirits. Only his right hand remained intact as it was kept and preserved by many races throughout history, including the first race of man. The Right Hand of Doom eventually ended up in the possession of Azzael before he grafted it onto the newborn Hellboy.\n\nAs the hand which created and bound the Ogdru Jahad, it is also the key that will \"loose and command\" them; in other words, it is a catalyst that will bring about [[Ragnarok]]. The comic books themselves never mention how the Right Hand of Doom would actually perform these tasks; they only explain this is the case and someone or something intends to do it, with or without Hellboy's consent. The film shows it working as a key: being turned twice in a special obelisk secured by Rasputin would release the Ogdru Jahad. It is made clear it is not necessary for the arm to be attached to Hellboy to perform its duties. It has been suggested if Hellboy dies while the Hand is attached to him, it would become useless. He has, therefore, concluded the only way to prevent its falling into the wrong hands is to keep and protect it.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nHellboy originated with a drawing [[Mike Mignola]] did at a [[comic book convention]] of a demon with the name \"Hellboy\" written on his belt. Mignola had initially no intention of doing anything serious with the concept, but eventually decided he liked the name.<ref name=\"Back21\">{{cite journal|last= Irving|first= Christopher|date= April 2007|title= The Genesis of Hellboy|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 21|pages= 3\u20135}}</ref>\n\nLater, Mignola became interested in doing a creator-owned comic, as he felt it made more sense to create his own characters for the stories he wanted to tell, rather than trying to shoehorn existing characters into these stories. Mignola elaborated, \"The kinds of stories I wanted to do I had in mind before I created Hellboy. It\u2019s not like I created Hellboy and said, 'Hey, now what does this guy do?' I knew the kinds of stories I wanted to do, but just needed a main guy.\" He initially created Hellboy as part of a team of five, but scrapped this idea when he realized he could not think of any team names that he liked.<ref name=\"Back21\"/>\n\nMuch like other American comic book superheroes such as [[Batman]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Iron Man]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]], Hellboy is constantly tormented by the knowledge of his past. One example being in ''Wake the Devil'' where he describes his mindset since the aftermath of ''Seed of Destruction'' by saying, \"I ''like'' not knowing. I've gotten by for fifty-two years without knowing. I sleep good ''not knowing''.\"\n\n==Publication history==\n{{See also|List of Hellboy comics}}\nBefore ''Hellboy'' was published independently at Dark Horse Comics, the concept was initially pitched to a board of directors for [[DC Comics]], who loved it, but did not like the idea of it involving \"Hell\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bamkapow.com/hellboy2-tokens.php |title=Hellboy II: The Golden Army |work=Bam!

The increasing commitments from the ''Hellboy'' franchise meant that the 2008 [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''In the Chapel of Moloch'' was the first ''Hellboy'' comic Mignola had provided the script and art for since ''The Island'' in 2005.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18580 | title=Going to the Chapel: Mignola Returns to Drawing ''Hellboy'' | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=October 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Issues===\n''Hellboy'' has an internal numbering on the inside cover of its issues.

Dark Horse Books. {{ISBN|1-59582-567-3}}.\n\n===Other appearances===\nBeyond the ''Hellboy'' comic and its associated spin-offs, Hellboy has made appearances in other publications:\n\n====Great Salt Lake Comic-Con pamphlet====\nThe character name \"Hell Boy\" was included in a drawing by Mike Mignola of a demon character in a black and white illustration, with the later recognized name appearing on the demon's belt buckle. This image, accompanied by a short biography of Mike Mignola and his latest creation, appeared in the pamphlet in 1991. It is the first published mention of the later recognized name. This image was reprinted in'' The Art of Hellboy''. This image was also used to create the \u201cFirst Hellboy\u201d statue by Mondo Tees, in both black and white and full color.\n\n====''Dime Press''====\nA prototype incarnation of Hellboy appeared on the cover of ''Dime Press'' #4 (Glamour International Production, 1993), an obscure Italian fanzine, with \"Hellboy\u00a9Mignola 93\" written at the bottom of the cover. The cover, illustrated by Mignola and by the Italian artist [[Nicola Mari]], show Hellboy in the act of attacking a \"diabolic\" version of the Italian SF comic book character [[Nathan Never]] (with bat wings and pointed tail). Mari at the time was one of the artists that worked on Nathan Never, and the first two years of the life of this comic were the main topic of the fanzine. With the exception of the cover, there is no other mention of Hellboy within the fanzine. The character shown was still in a draft stage, and although close to the final design of Hellboy, it had gray skin and an outfit not common to the character.\n\n====''San Diego Comic-Con Comics''====\n''Mike Mignola's Hellboy'' by Mike Mignola and John Byrne featured the character's first full appearance, and was a four-page black-and-white story that had an approximately 1,500 book print run. It was published by [[Dark Horse Comics]] in ''San Diego Comic-Con Comics'' #2 (August 1993) for distribution at the [[Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]] [[comic book convention|convention]] held in [[San Diego]], [[California]].

{"title_page": "Structural history of the Roman military", "text_new": "{{featured article}}\n{{RomanMilitary}}\n\nThe '''structural history of the Roman military''' concerns the major transformations in the organization and constitution of [[ancient Rome]]'s [[Military of ancient Rome|armed forces]], \"the most effective and long-lived military institution known to history.\"<ref name=\"EB1911\">''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', Eleventh Edition (1911), ''The Roman Army''</ref> From its origins around 800&nbsp;BC to its final dissolution in AD&nbsp;476 with the demise of the [[Western Roman Empire]], Rome's military organization underwent substantial structural change. At the highest level of structure, the forces were split into the [[Roman army]] and the [[Roman navy]], although these two branches were less distinct than in many modern national defense forces. Within the top levels of both army and navy, structural changes occurred as a result of both positive military reform and organic structural evolution. These changes can be divided into four distinct phases.\n\n;Phase I: The army was derived from obligatory annual military service levied on the citizenry, as part of their [[social contract|duty to the state]]. During this period, the Roman army would wage seasonal campaigns against largely local adversaries.\n\n;Phase II: As the extent of the territories falling under Roman control expanded and the size of the forces increased, the soldiery gradually became salaried professionals. As a consequence, military service at the lower (non-salaried) levels became progressively longer-term. Roman military units of the period were largely homogeneous and highly regulated. The army consisted of units of citizen infantry known as [[Roman legion|legions]] (Latin: ''legiones'') as well as non-legionary allied troops known as ''[[auxilia]]''. The latter were most commonly called upon to provide light infantry, logistical, or cavalry support.\n\n;Phase III: At the height of the Roman Empire's power, forces were tasked with manning and securing the borders of the vast provinces which had been brought under Roman control. Serious strategic threats were less common in this period and emphasis was placed on preserving gained territory. The army underwent changes in response to these new needs and became more dependent on fixed garrisons than on march-camps and continuous field operations.\n\n;Phase IV: As Rome began to struggle to keep control over its sprawling territories, military service continued to be salaried and professional for Rome's regular troops. However, the trend of employing allied or mercenary elements was expanded to such an extent that these troops came to represent a substantial proportion of the armed forces. At the same time, the uniformity of structure found in Rome's earlier military disappeared. Soldiery of the era ranged from lightly armed mounted archers to heavy infantry, in regiments of varying size and quality. This was accompanied by a trend in the late empire of an increasing predominance of cavalry rather than infantry troops, as well as a requirement for more mobile operations. In this period there was more focus (on all frontiers but the east) on smaller units of independently-operating troops, engaging less in set-piece battles and more in low-intensity, guerilla actions.\n\n==Tribal forces (c. 752 BC \u2013 c. 578 BC)==\n{{Main|Early Roman army}}\nAccording to the historians [[Livy]] and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], writing at a far later date, the earliest Roman army existed in the 8th century&nbsp;BC. During this period Rome itself was probably little more than a fortified hilltop settlement and its army a relatively small force, whose activities were limited \"mainly [to] raiding and cattle rustling with the occasional skirmish-like battle\".<ref name=\"goldsworthyP18\">Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 18</ref> Historian [[Theodor Mommsen]] referred to it as Rome's ''curiate'' army, named for its presumed subdivision along the boundaries of Rome's three founding tribes (Latin: ''[[curia]]e''), the [[Ramnians]], [[Tities (roman tribe)|Tities]] and [[Luceres]].<ref>Mommsen, ''The History of Rome'', Volume 1, p. 40</ref>  This army's exact structure is not known, but it is probable that it loosely resembled a warrior band or group of bodyguards led by a chieftain or king.<ref>Keppie, ''The Making of the Roman Army'', p. 14</ref> Mommsen believes that Roman military organization of this period was regimented by the \"Laws of [the apocryphal] King [V]Italus\"<ref name=mommsen22>Mommsen, ''The History of Rome'', Volume 1, p. 22</ref> but these laws, though referred to by [[Aristotle]], have been lost.\n\nThe army (Latin: ''legio'') consisted, according to Livy, of exactly 3,000 infantry and 300 horsemen, one third from each of Rome's three founding tribes.'''{{r|group=Note|A}}'''<ref name=\"grantP22\">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 22<br>* Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565&nbsp;AD'', p. 69</ref>  Warriors served under six \"leaders of division\" (Latin: ''tribuni'') who in turn served under a general, usually in the person of the reigning King. Mommsen uses [[philological]] arguments and references from Livy and others to suggest that the greater mass of foot-soldiers probably consisted of ''[[pilumni]]'' (javelin-throwers), with a smaller number possibly serving as ''[[arquites]]'' (archers).<ref name=mommsen20>Mommsen, ''The History of Rome'', Volume 1, p. 20</ref> The cavalry was far smaller in number and probably consisted solely of the town's richest citizens.<ref name=Boak69>Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565&nbsp;AD'', p. 69</ref> The army may also have contained the earliest form of chariots,<ref>Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565&nbsp;AD'', p. 86</ref> hinted at by references to the ''flexuntes'' (\"the wheelers\").<ref>Mommsen, ''The History of Rome'', Volume 1, p. 65</ref>\n\nBy the beginning of the 7th century&nbsp;BC, the [[Iron-Age]] [[Etruscans|Etruscan civilization]] (Latin: ''Etrusci'') was dominant in the region.<ref>Livy, ''The Rise of Rome'', Book 5, chapter 33<br>* Pallottino, ''The Etruscans'', p. 68</ref> Like most of the other peoples in the region, the Romans warred against the Etruscans. By the close of the century, the Romans had lost their struggle for independence, and the Etruscans had conquered Rome, establishing a military dictatorship, or kingdom, in the city.\n\n==Etruscan-model hoplites (578&nbsp;BC \u2013 c. 315&nbsp;BC)==\n{{Main|Early Roman army}}\n[[Image:Helmed Hoplite Sparta.JPG|thumb|205px|right|Ancient Greek sculpture of a [[hoplite]] (c.&nbsp;5th century&nbsp;BC, Arch\u00e6ological Museum of [[Sparti (municipality)|Sparti]]), on which Rome's first class of infantry was based.]]\nAlthough several Roman sources including [[Livy]] and [[Polybius]] talk extensively about the Roman army of the [[Roman Kingdom]] period that followed the Etruscan capture of the city, no contemporary accounts survive. Polybius, for example, was writing some 300 years after the events in question, and Livy some 500 years later. Additionally, what records were kept by the Romans at this time were later destroyed when the city was sacked. The sources for this period cannot therefore be seen as reliable, as they can be for later military history, e.g. from the [[First Punic War]] onwards.\n\nAccording to our surviving narratives, the three kings of Rome during the Etruscan occupation were [[Tarquinius Priscus]], [[Servius Tullius]], and [[Tarquinius Superbus]]. During this period the army underwent a reformation into a ''centurial'' army based on socio-economic class.<ref name=\"Livy42\">Livy, ''The Rise of Rome'', Book 1, chapter 42</ref> [[Servian constitution|This reformation]] is traditionally attributed to Servius Tullius, the second of the [[Roman Kingdom|Etruscan kings]]. Tullius had earlier carried out the first Roman census of all citizens.<ref name=\"Livy43\">Livy, ''The Rise of Rome'', Book 1, chapter 43</ref> Livy tells us that Tullius reformed the army by transplanting onto it the structure derived originally for civil life as a result of this census.<ref name=\"Livy42\"/> At all levels, military service was, at this time, considered to be a civic responsibility and a way of advancing one's status within society.<ref name=\"smithP10\">Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 10</ref>\n\nHowever, Rome's social classes were qualified rather than created by the census. It is perhaps more accurate to say therefore that the army's structure was slightly refined during this period rather than radically reformed. Prior to these reforms, the infantry was divided into the ''classis'' of rich citizens and the ''infra classem'' of poorer citizens. The latter were excluded from the regular line of battle on the basis that their equipment was of poor quality.<ref name=Boak69/> During the reforms, this crude division of poorer and richer citizens was further stratified. The army thereafter consisted of a number of troop types based upon the social class of propertied citizens, collectively known as ''[[adsidui]]''. From the poorest in the \"fifth class\" to the richest in the \"first class\" and the [[Roman equestrian order|equestrians]] above them, military service was compulsory for all.<ref name=\"gabbaP2\">Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army And the Allies'', p.  2</ref> However, Roman citizens at this time generally viewed military service as a proper undertaking of duty to the state, in contrast to later views of military service as an unwelcome and unpleasant burden.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 334<br>* Boak, ''A History of Rome'', p. 454</ref> Whereas there are accounts of Romans in the late empire mutilating their own bodies in order to exempt themselves from military service,<ref>Campbell, ''The Crisis of Empire'', p. 126<br>* Boak, ''A History of Rome'', p. 454</ref> there seems to have been no such reluctance to serve in the military of early Rome. This may in part be due to the generally lower intensity of conflict in this era; to the fact that men were fighting close to and often in protection of their own homes, or due to\u2014as posited by later Roman writers\u2014a greater martial spirit in antiquity.'''{{r|group=Note|B}}'''<ref name=\"vogtP158\">Vogt, ''The Decline of Rome'', p. 158</ref>\n\nThe equestrians, the highest social class of all, served in mounted units known as ''[[equites]]''. The [[Servius Tullius#Classes|first class]] of the richest citizens served as heavy infantry with swords and long spears (resembling [[hoplite]]s), and provided the first line of the battle formation. The [[Servius Tullius#Classes|second class]] were armed similarly to the first class, but without a [[breastplate]] for protection, and with an oblong rather than a round shield. The second class stood immediately behind the first class when the army was drawn up in battle formation. The [[Servius Tullius#Classes|third and fourth classes]] were more lightly armed and carried a thrusting-spear and javelins. The third class stood behind the second class in battle formation, normally providing javelin support. The poorest of the propertied men of the city comprised the [[Servius Tullius#Classes|fifth class]]. They were generally too poor to afford much equipment at all and were armed as skirmishers with [[Sling (weapon)|slings]] and stones. They were deployed in a screen in front of the main army, covering its approach and masking its manoeuvres.\n\nMen without property, who were thereby excluded from the qualifying social classes of the ''[[adsidui]]'', were exempted from military service on the grounds that they were too poor to provide themselves with any arms whatsoever.<ref name=\"Livy42\"/> However, in the most pressing circumstances, even these ''[[proletarii]]'' were pressed into service,<ref name=\"Gabba, Republican Rome, p. 5\">Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army And the Allies'', p. 5</ref> though their military worth was probably questionable. Troops in all of these classes would fight together on the battlefield, with the exception of the most senior troops, who were expected to guard the city.<ref name=\"Livy43\"/>\n\nThe army is said to have increased from 3,000 to 4,000 men in the 5th century BC, and then again from 4,000 to 6,000 men sometime before 400 BC.<ref name=Boak69 /> This later army of 6,000 men were then divided into 60 ''centuries'' of 100 men each.<ref name=\"grantP24\">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 24</ref>\n\n==Manipular legion (315\u2013107&nbsp;BC)==\n{{Main|Roman army of the mid-Republic}}\n[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3bis.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus]], c. 122 BC; the altar shows two Roman infantrymen equipped with long ''[[Scutum (shield)|scuta]]'' and a cavalryman with his horse. All are shown wearing [[chain mail]] armour.]]\nThe army of the early Republic continued to evolve, and although there was a tendency among Romans to attribute such changes to great reformers, it is more likely that changes were the product of slow evolution rather than singular and deliberate policy of reform.<ref name=\"grantP54\">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', Faber and Faber, 1979 p. 54</ref> The manipular formation was probably copied from Rome's [[Samnium|Samnite]] enemies to the south, perhaps as a result of Roman defeats in the [[Second Samnite War]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://history-world.org/samnite_wars.htm |title=Rome, The Samnite Wars<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2009-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014004107/http://history-world.org/samnite_wars.htm |archive-date=2011-10-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Sekunda, ''Early Roman Armies'', p. 40</ref>\n\nDuring this period, a military formation of around 5,000 men was known as a legion (Latin: ''legio''). However, in contrast to later legionary formations of exclusively heavy infantry, the legions of the early and middle Republic consisted of both light and heavy infantry. The term ''manipular legion'', a legion based on units called [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]], is therefore used to contrast the later ''cohortal'' legion of the Empire that was based around a system of ''cohort'' units. The manipular legion was based partially upon social class and partially upon age and military experience.<ref>Boak, '' A History of Rome to 565 A.D.'', p. 87</ref> It therefore represents a theoretical compromise between the earlier class-based army and the class-free armies of later years. In practice, even slaves were at one time pressed into the army of the Republic out of necessity.<ref name=\"santosuossoP10\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 10</ref> Normally a single legion was raised each year, but in 366&nbsp;BC two legions were raised in a single year for the first time.<ref name=Boak69/>\n\n''Maniples'' were units of 120 men each drawn from a single infantry class. The maniples were small enough to permit tactical movement of individual infantry units on the battlefield within the framework of the greater army. The maniples were typically deployed into three discrete lines (Latin: ''triplex acies'') based on the three heavy infantry types of ''[[hastati]]'', ''[[principes]]'' and ''[[triarii]]''.<ref name=\"santosuossoP18\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 18</ref> The first type, the ''hastati'', typically formed the first rank in battle formation.  They typically wore a brass chest plate (though some could afford mail), a helmet called a galea, and occasionally, greaves (shin guards). They carried an iron bossed wooden shield, 120&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;ft) tall and rectangular in shape with a curved front to partially protect the sides. Traditionally they were armed with a sword known as a ''[[gladius]]'' and two [[throwing spear]]s known as ''[[pilum|pila]]'': one the heavy ''pilum'' of popular imagination and one a slender javelin.<ref name=\"polybiusB6\">Polybius, ''History'', Book 6</ref> However the exact introduction of the Gladius and the replacement of the spear with the sword as the primary weapon of the Roman Legions is uncertain, and it's possible that the early manipular legions still fought with the Hastati and Principes wielding the Hasta or Spear.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" | \"the Romans&nbsp;... habitually enroll four legions each year, each consisting of about four thousand foot and two hundred horse; and when any unusual necessity arises, they raise the number of foot to five thousand and of the horse to three hundred.

They were heavy infantry soldiers armed and armoured as per the hastati.  The ''triarii'', who typically formed the third rank when the army was arrayed for battle, were the last remnant of hoplite-style troops in the Roman army. They were armed and armoured as per the ''principes'', with the exception that they carried a [[pike (weapon)|pike]] rather than two ''pila''.<ref name=\"polybiusB6\"/> A 600-man triarii maniple was divided into two formations each six men across by 10 men deep.<ref name=\"manip\">[http://www.strategypage.com/articles/default.asp?target=marius/manipletocohort From Maniple to Cohort], Strategy Page</ref> A manipular legion typically contained between 1,200-2400 ''hastati'', 1,200-2400 ''principes'' and 600-1200 ''triarii''.<ref name=\"LuttwakP40\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 40</ref> The three classes of unit may have retained some slight parallel to social divisions within Roman society, but at least officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven men would serve as ''hastati'', older men with some military experience as ''principes'', and veteran troops of advanced age and experience as ''triarii''.\n\nThe heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry (Latin: ''[[velites]]'') and cavalry (Latin: ''[[equites]]'') troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion.<ref name=\"santosuossoP18\"/> The cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest class of equestrians, but additional cavalry and light infantry were drawn at times from the [[socii]] and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latini]] of the Italian mainland. The ''equites'' were still drawn from the [[Equestrian (Roman)|wealthier]] classes in Roman society. There was an additional class of troops (Latin: ''[[accensi]]'', also ''adscripticii'' and later ''supernumerarii'') who followed the army without specific martial roles and were deployed to the rear of the ''triarii''. Their role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in the maniples, but they also seem to have acted occasionally as orderlies to the officers.\n\nThe light infantry of 1,200 ''velites''<ref name=\"santosuossoP18\"/> consisted of unarmoured skirmishing troops drawn from the youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and [[shield]] (90&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;ft) diameter), as well as several light javelins, each with a 90&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;ft) wooden shaft the diameter of a finger, with a c.&nbsp;25&nbsp;cm (10&nbsp;in) narrow metal point.<ref name=\"polybiusB6\"/> Their numbers were swollen by the addition of allied light infantry and irregular ''[[rorarii]]''.\n\nThe Roman levy of 403&nbsp;BC was the first to be requested to campaign for longer than a single season,<ref>Livy, ''The Rise of Rome'', Book 5, ch. 1</ref> and from this point on such a practice became gradually more common, if still not typical.\n\nA small navy had operated at a fairly low level after the [[Second Samnite War]], but it was massively upgraded during this period, expanding from a few primarily river- and coastal-based patrol craft to a full maritime unit. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size. This was partially because a pacified Roman Mediterranean called for little naval policing, and partially because the Romans chose to rely during this period on ships provided by Greek cities, whose peoples had greater maritime experience.<ref name=\"websterP156\">Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 156</ref>\n\n===Proletarianisation of the infantry (217\u2013107&nbsp;BC)===\nThe extraordinary demands of the [[Punic Wars]], in addition to a shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, at least in the short term.<ref>Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 2</ref> In 217&nbsp;BC, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners when slaves were pressed into naval service;<ref name=\"santosuossoP10\"/> around 213&nbsp;BC, the property requirement was reduced from 11,000 to 4,000 [[As (coin)|asses]].<ref name=\"santosuossoP10\"/> Since the Romans are unlikely to have preferred to employ slaves over poor citizens in their armies,<ref name=\"Gabba, Republican Rome, p. 5\"/> it must be assumed that, at this point, the ''proletarii'' of the poorest citizens must also have been pressed into service despite their lack of legal qualification. By 123&nbsp;BC, the financial requirement for military service was slashed again from 4,000 asses to just 1,500 asses.<ref name=\"gabbaP7\">Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 7</ref> By this time, therefore, it is clear that many of the property-less former ''proletarii'' had been nominally admitted into the ''[[adsidui]]''.<ref name=\"gabbaP7\"/>\n\nDuring the 2nd century&nbsp;BC, Roman territory saw an overall decline in population,<ref name=\"gabbaP9\">Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 9</ref> partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes into lower classes of the census and the ''proletarii''.<ref name=\"gabbaP9\"/> As a result, both the Roman society and its military became increasingly proletarianised. The Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state, since many of the soldiers who made up its lower classes were now impoverished ''proletarii'' in all but name, and were too poor to afford their own equipment.<ref name=\"gabbaP9\"/>\n\nThe distinction between the heavy infantry types of ''hastati'', ''principes'' and ''triarii'' began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment to all but the first class of troops, who alone were able to afford their own equipment.<ref name=\"gabbaP9\"/> By the time of Polybius, the ''triarii'' or their successors still represented a distinct heavy infantry type armed with a unique style of cuirass, but the ''hastati'' and ''principes'' had become indistinguishable.<ref name=\"gabbaP9\"/>\n\nIn addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon its allies (''socii'') for the provision of allied troops.<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 11</ref> Where accepted allies could not provide the required force types, the Romans were not averse during this period to hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.<ref>Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 143</ref>\n\n==Marian legion (107\u201327&nbsp;BC)==\n[[Image:Marius Glyptothek Munich 319.jpg|thumb|205px|right|Bust of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]], instigator of the [[Marian reforms]]]]\n{{Main|Roman army of the late Republic}}\nIn a process known as the [[Marian reforms]], [[Roman consul]] [[Gaius Marius]] carried out a programme of reform of the Roman military.<ref name=\"santosuossoP10\"/> In 107&nbsp;BC, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army.<ref>Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565 A.D.'', p. 189<br>* Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 10</ref> This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service.<ref>Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army And the Allies'', p. 1</ref> The distinction between ''hastati'', ''principes'' and ''triarii'', which had already become blurred, was officially removed,<ref name=\"santosuossoP18\"/><ref>Cary & Scullard, ''A History of Rome'', p. 219</ref> and the [[Roman legion|legionary infantry]] of popular imagination was created. Legionary infantry formed a homogeneous force of [[heavy infantry]]. These legionaries were drawn from citizen stock; by this time, Roman or Latin citizenship had been regionally expanded over much of ancient Italy and [[Cisalpine Gaul]].<ref name=\"luttwakP27\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 27</ref> Lighter citizen infantry, such as the ''velites'' and ''equites'', were replaced by non-citizen ''[[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxilia]]'' that could consist of foreign [[mercenaries]].<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 16</ref> Due to the concentration of the citizen legions into a force of heavy infantry<ref name=\"LuttwakP40\"/> Rome's armies depended on auxiliary cavalry attachments for support. As a tactical necessity, legions were almost always accompanied by an equal or greater number of lighter auxiliary troops,<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'', IV, 5</ref> which were drawn from the non-citizens of the Empire's territories. One known exception of legions being formed from non-citizen provinces during this period was the legion that was raised in the province of [[Galatia]].<ref name=\"luttwakP27\"/>\n\nAfter Marius, the legions were drawn largely from volunteer citizens rather than citizens conscripted for duty.<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 16</ref> Volunteers came forward and were accepted not from citizens of the city of Rome itself but from the surrounding countryside and smaller towns falling under Roman control.<ref name=\"SantosuossoP29\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 29</ref> Whereas some long-term military professionals were classed as [[veteran]]s, they were outnumbered by civilians with limited military experience who were in active service perhaps only for a few campaigns.<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 51</ref> The legions of the late Republic remained, unlike the legions of the later Empire, predominantly Roman in origin, although some small number of ex-auxiliary troops were probably incorporated.<ref>Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 56</ref> The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.<ref name=\"SantosuossoP29\"/>\n\nUnlike earlier in the Republic, legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land.'''{{r|group=Note|C}}''' Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a fixed-term basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest sections of society, to whom a guaranteed salary was attractive.<ref name=\"gabbaP25\">Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 25</ref> The army therefore consisted of a far higher proportion of the poor\u2014particularly the rural poor\u2014than it had previously.<ref>Boak, ''A History of Rome'', p. 189</ref> A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat \"acquired a stronger and more elevated position\"<ref name=\"gabbaP25\"/> within the state. This professionalisation of the military was necessary to provide permanent garrisons for newly acquired and distant territories such as [[Hispania]], something not possible under an army of seasonal citizen militia.\n\nHistorian R. E. Smith notes that there was a need to raise additional legions in an emergency to repel specific strategic threats. He argues that this may have resulted in two types of legion.<ref name=\"smithP29\">Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 29</ref> Long-standing legions deployed overseas were probably professional troops forming a standing army. Quickly-formed new legions, in contrast, consisted of younger men, perhaps with little or no military experience, who hoped for adventure and plunder.<ref name=\"smithP29\"/> However, no distinction in basic pay, discipline or armour is known of between the two types of legion. The practice of veteran troops signing up again voluntarily into newly raised legions must have meant that no one army conformed exactly to one or other of these theoretical archetypes.\n\nThe legions of the late Republic were, structurally, almost entirely heavy infantry. The legion's main sub-unit was called a ''[[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]'' and consisted of approximately 480 infantrymen.<ref name=\"luttwakP14\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 14</ref> The cohort was therefore a much larger unit than the earlier ''maniple'' sub-unit, and was divided into six [[Centuria#Military|centuriae]] of 80 men each.<ref name=\"luttwakP14\"/> Each centuria was separated further into 10 \"tent groups\" (Latin: ''[[contubernia]]'') of 8 men each. Legions additionally consisted of a small body, typically 120 men, of Roman legionary cavalry (Latin: ''[[equites legionis]]''). The ''equites'' were used as scouts and dispatch riders rather than battlefield cavalry.<ref>Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 116</ref> Legions also contained a dedicated artillery crew of perhaps 60 men, who would operate devices such as ''[[ballistae]]''.<ref name=\"luttwakP14\"/>\n\nEach legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied (non-Roman) ''auxiliae'' troops.<ref name=\"luttwakP15\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 15</ref> The addition of allied troops to the Roman army was a formalisation of the earlier arrangement of using light troops from the [[Socii]] and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latini]], who had received Roman citizenship after the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]].<ref>Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 27</ref> Auxiliary troops could be formed from either auxiliary light cavalry known as ''[[Ala (Roman military)|alae]]'', auxiliary light infantry known as ''cohors auxiliae'', or a flexible mixture of the two known as ''cohors equitata''.<ref name=\"luttwakP15\"/> Cavalry types included mounted archers (Latin: ''[[Horse archer|sagittarii]]'') and heavy shock cavalry (Latin: ''[[cataphracti]]'' or ''[[clibanarii]]''). Infantry could be armed with bows, slings, throwing spears, long swords, or thrusting spears. Auxiliary units were originally led by their own chiefs, and, in this period, their internal organisation was left to their commanders.<ref name=\"WebsterP146\">Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 146</ref>\n\nHowever, \"the most obvious deficiency\" of the Roman army remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry;<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 43</ref> even auxiliary troops were predominantly infantry. Luttwak argues that auxiliary forces largely consisted of [[Crete|Cretan]] archers, [[Balearics|Balearic]] slingers and [[Numidia]]n infantry, all of whom fought on foot.<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 44</ref> As Rome's borders expanded and its adversaries changed from largely infantry-based to largely cavalry-based troops, the infantry-based Roman army began to find itself at a tactical disadvantage, particularly in the East.\n\nAfter having declined in size following the subjugation of the Mediterranean, the Roman navy underwent short-term upgrading and revitalisation in the late Republic to meet several new demands. Under [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], an invasion fleet was assembled in the [[English Channel]] to allow the invasion of [[Roman Britain|Britain]]; under [[Pompey]], a large fleet was raised in the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea of [[Cilicia]]n pirates.<ref name=\"websterP156\"/> During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities.<ref name=\"websterP156\"/>\n\n===Non-citizen recruitment (49\u201327&nbsp;BC)===\nBy the time of [[Julius Caesar]] in 54&nbsp;BC, regular legionary units were supplemented by ''[[exploratores]]'', a body of scouts, and ''[[speculatores]]'', spies who infiltrated enemy camps.<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 67</ref> Due to the demands of the civil war, the extraordinary measure of recruiting legions from non-citizens was taken by Caesar in [[Transalpine Gaul]] (Latin: ''Gallia Transalpina''), by [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], and by [[Pompey]] in [[Pharsalus]].<ref>Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 57</ref> This irregular and extraordinary recruitment was not, however, typical of recruitment during this period, and Roman law still officially required that legions were recruited from Roman citizens only.\n\n==Imperial legions and reformation of the auxilia (27&nbsp;BC \u2013 117&nbsp;AD)==\n{{Main|Imperial Roman army}}\n\nBy the turn of the millennium, Emperor [[Augustus]]' primary military concern was to prevent Roman generals from further usurping the imperial throne.<ref name=\"smithP71\">Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 71</ref> The experience of Caesar and, earlier, Marius and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], had demonstrated the willingness of \"emergency\" (re-activated previously decommissioned) legions containing troops keen for plunder to follow their generals against the state. Augustus therefore removed the need for such emergency armies by increasing the size of the standing armies to a size sufficient to provide territorial defence on their own.<ref>Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565 A.D.'', p. 270<br>* Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 71</ref> Perhaps due to similar concerns, the legions and auxiliaries of the army were supplemented under the Emperor Augustus by an elite formation of guards dedicated to the protection of the Emperor. The first such unit was based in Rome and were known as the [[Praetorian Guard]], and a second similar formation were known as the [[Cohortes urbanae]].<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 17<br>* Grant, ''A History of Rome'', p. 209</ref>\n\nThe legions, which had been a mix of life professionals and civilian campaigners, was altered into a standing army of professionals only.<ref name=\"santosuossoP91\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 91</ref> The actual structure of the cohort army remained much the same as in the late Republic, although around the 1st century&nbsp;AD the first cohort of each legion was increased in size to a total of 800 soldiers.<ref>Hassall, ''The Army'', p. 325<br>* Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 91</ref> However, while the structure of the legions remained much the same, their make-up gradually changed. Whereas early Republican legions had been raised by a draft from eligible Roman citizens, imperial legions were recruited solely on a voluntary basis and from a much wider base of manpower. Likewise, whereas Republican legions had been recruited almost exclusively in Italy, early Imperial legions drew most of their recruits from Roman colonies in the provinces from 68&nbsp;AD onwards. One estimate places the proportion of Italian troops at 65% under Augustus in c.&nbsp;1&nbsp;AD, falling to around 49% by the end of Nero's reign.<ref name=\"santosuossoP98\">Santosuosso, Storming the Heavens, p. 98</ref>\n[[Image:2005-12-28 Berlin Pergamon museum (16).jpg|thumb|left|205px|[[Relief depicting a Roman legionary (Berlin SK 887)|Bas-relief carving of a Roman legionary]] out of battle dress, c.&nbsp;1st century&nbsp;AD ([[Pergamon Museum]], [[Berlin]])]]\nSince the legions were officially open only to Roman citizens, Max Cary and [[Howard Hayes Scullard]] argue that at least in some provinces at this time \"many provincials must have been recruited who lacked any genuine claim to Roman citizenship but received it unofficially on enlistment,\"<ref>Cary & Scullard, ''A History of Rome'', p. 338</ref> a practice that was to increase in the 2nd century.<ref>Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter I, p. 36</ref> This is most likely in those provinces where the pool of Roman citizens was not large enough to fulfill the provincial army's recruitment needs. One possible example is [[Roman Britain|Britain]], where one estimate puts the citizen pool in the 1st century at only 50,000 out of a total provincial population of around two million.<ref>Mattingly, ''An Imperial Possession - Britain in the Roman Empire'', pp. 166\u20138</ref>\n\nAt the same time as the legions underwent these transformations, the ''auxilia'' were reorganized and a number of allied troops were formalised into standing units similar to legions. Rather than being raised re-actively when required, the process of raising auxiliary troops was carried out in advance of conflicts according to annual targets.<ref>Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 144</ref> Whereas the internal organisation of the ''auxilia'' had previously been left up to their commanders, in the early empire they were organised into standardised units known as ''turmae'' (for cavalry ''alae'') and ''centuriae'' (for infantry ''cohortes'').<ref name=\"WebsterP146\"/> Although never becoming as standardised in their equipment as the legions,<ref>Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 152</ref> and often retaining some national flavour, the size of the units at least was standardised to some degree. Cavalry were formed into either an ''ala quingenaria'' of 512 horsemen, or an ''ala millaria'' of 1,000 horsemen.<ref name=\"luttwakP15\"/> Likewise, infantry auxilia could be formed into a ''cohors quingenaria'' of 500 men or a ''cohors millaria'' of 1,000 men.<ref name=\"luttwakP15\"/> Mixed cavalry/infantry auxiliaries were typically formed with a larger proportion of foot than horse troops: the ''cohors equitata quingenaria'' consisted of 380 foot and 120 horsemen, and the ''cohors equitata millaria'' consisted of 760 foot and 240 horsemen.<ref name=\"luttwakP15\"/>\n\nThe vitality of the empire at this point was such that the use of native ''auxilia'' in the Roman army did not apparently barbarise the military as some scholars claim was to happen in the late empire.<ref name=\"WebsterP150\">Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 150</ref> On the contrary, those serving in the ''auxilia''  during this period frequently strove to Romanise themselves. They were granted Roman citizenship on retirement, granting them several social advantages, and their sons became eligible for service in the legions.<ref>Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 147</ref>\n\nAs with the army, many non-Italians were recruited into the Roman Navy, partly because  the Romans had never readily taken to the sea. It appears that the navy was considered to be slightly less prestigious than the ''auxilia'' but, like the ''auxilia'', troops could gain citizenship on discharge upon retirement. In terms of structure, each ship was staffed by a group of men approximately equivalent to a century, with ten ships forming a naval squadron.<ref name=\"websterP165\">Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 165</ref>\n\n===Introduction of vexillationes (76\u2013117&nbsp;AD)===\n[[Image:Roman soldiers with marching packs 02.JPG|thumb|right|205px|Roman soldiers of around 101&nbsp;AD from a cast of Trajan's column, c.&nbsp;113&nbsp;AD ([[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[London]])]]\nThrough the final years of the 1st century&nbsp;AD, the legions remained the backbone of the Roman army, although the ''auxilia'' in fact outnumbered them by up to half as much again.<ref>Hassall, ''The High Empire, AD&nbsp;70\u2013192'', p. 320</ref> Within the legions, the proportion of troops recruited from within Italy fell gradually after 70&nbsp;AD.<ref name =\"hassallP331\">Hassall, ''The High Empire, AD&nbsp;70\u2013192'', p. 331</ref> By the close of the 1st century, this proportion had fallen to as low as 22 percent, with the remainder drawn from conquered provinces.<ref name=\"santosuossoP98\"/> Since technically only citizens were allowed to enlist in the legions, where recruits did not possess citizenship then, at least in some instances, citizenship \"was simply given [to] them on enlistment\".<ref>Hassall, ''The High Empire, AD 70\u2013192'', p. 331<br>* Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter I, p. 36</ref> During this time, the borders of the Empire had remained relatively fixed to the extent originally reached under the Emperor [[Trajan]]. Because of this, the army was increasingly responsible for protecting existing frontiers rather than expanding into foreign territory, the latter of which had characterised the army's earlier existence.<ref name=\"alfoldiP211\">Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 211</ref> As a result, legions became stationed in largely fixed locations. Although entire legions were occasionally transferred into theatres of war, they remained largely rooted in one or more legionary bases in a province, detaching into smaller bodies of troops (Latin: ''[[vexillationes]]'') on demand.<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 124</ref> This policy eventually led to a split of the military's land-based forces into mobile and fixed troops in the later Empire. In general, the best troops were dispatched as ''vexillationes'', and the remainder left to guard border defences were of lower quality, perhaps those with injuries or near retirement.<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', pp. 153\u2013154</ref>\n\n==Barbarisation of the army (117\u2013253&nbsp;AD)==\n[[File:Sarcofago dio portonaccio, 03.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Battle with [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] troops, on the [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]] (190-200)]]\n\nBy the time of the emperor [[Hadrian]] the proportion of Italians in the legions had fallen to just ten percent<ref name=\"santosuossoP98\"/> and provincial citizens now dominated. This low figure is probably a direct result of the changing needs of military staffing: a system of fixed border defences (Latin: ''[[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]'') were established around the Empire's periphery under Hadrian, consolidating Trajan's territorial gains. These called for troops to be stationed permanently in the provinces, a prospect more attractive to locally raised rather than Italian troops.<ref name=\"santosuossoP98\"/> The higher prestige and pay to be found in the Italian dominated [[Praetorian Guard]] must also have played a role. The majority of the troops in the legions at the start of the 3rd century&nbsp;AD were from the more Romanised (though non-Italian) provinces, especially [[Illyria]].<ref name=\"alfoldiP208\">Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 208</ref> As the century progressed, more and more barbarians (Latin: ''[[barbarian|barbari]]'') were permitted to settle inside of, and tasked with aiding in the defence of, Rome's borders.<ref name=\"vogtP58\">Vogt, ''The Decline of Rome'', p. 58.</ref> As a result, greater numbers of barbarous and semi-barbarous peoples were gradually admitted to the army.<ref name=\"alfoldiP208\"/>\n[[Image:Grande Ludovisi Altemps Inv8574.jpg|thumb|right|250px|3rd-century Roman soldiers battling barbarian troops on the [[Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus]] (250-260)]]\n\nHowever, whether this regionalisation of the legions was partnered by a drop in the professionalism of the troops is contested. [[Antonio Santosuosso]] argues that the strict discipline and high motivation of the days of Marius had lapsed,<ref name=\"santosuossoP173\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 173</ref> but Andrew Alfoldi states that the Illyrian troops were both valiant and warlike,<ref name=\"alfoldiP208\"/> and [[Tacitus]] described [[Germanic peoples|German]] recruits as being natural mercenaries (Latin: ''vivi ad arma nati'').<ref>Tacitus, ''History'', 4, 64</ref> It seems that discipline in the legions did slacken, with soldiers granted permission to live with wives outside of military lodgings and permitted to adopt a more lavish and comfortable lifestyle, in contrast to the strict military regimen of earlier years.<ref name=\"santosuossoP173\"/> However, it is by no means certain that this led to any reduction in the effectiveness of the legions, due to the greater ferocity and stature of the ''barbari'' recruits.  The flavour of the Roman military, however, was now dictated by the increasing number of regional recruits, leading to a partial barbarisation of Rome's military forces beginning in this period.<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 174</ref> The barbarisation of the lower ranks was paralleled by a concurrent barbarisation of its command structure, with the Roman senators who had traditionally provided its commanders becoming entirely excluded from the army. By 235&nbsp;AD the [[Maximinus Thrax|Emperor himself]], the figurehead of the entire military, was a man born outside of Italy to non-Italian parents.<ref name=\"santosuossoP175\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 175</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"A young nobleman, strong of hand and quick of mind and far more intelligent than your average barbarian&nbsp;... the ardour of his face and eyes showed the burning spirit within.

They were both less regimented and less Romanised than auxiliary troops, with a \"pronounced national character,\"<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 122</ref> including native dress and native war cries.<ref name=\"WebsterP150\"/> The introduction of the ''numeri'' was a response to the need for cheap troops, who were nevertheless fierce and provided a force balance of light infantry and cavalry.<ref name=\"luttwakP123\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 123</ref> They were therefore largely less well armed and less well trained than ''auxilia'' or legions,<ref name=\"alfoldiP211\"/> although more prestigious elite irregular native troops were also utilised.<ref name=\"alfoldiP216\">Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 216</ref> However, the legions still made up around one half of the Roman army at this point.<ref name=\"alfoldiP208\"/>\n\n==Successive crises (238\u2013359 AD)==\n{{Main|Late Roman army|Sacer comitatus}}\n[[Image:Knight-Iran.JPG|thumb|205px|right|A 6th-century carving of  a [[Sassanid]] armoured knight, the model for the Roman ''catafractarii'']]\nBy the late Empire, enemy forces in both the East and West were \"sufficiently mobile and sufficiently strong to pierce [the Roman] defensive perimeter on any selected axis of penetration\";<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 176</ref> from the 3rd century onwards, both Germanic tribes and Persian armies pierced the frontiers of the Roman Empire.<ref>Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 211<br>* Heather, ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'', pp. 58\u201367</ref> In response, the Roman army underwent a series of changes, more organic and evolutionary than the deliberate military reforms of the Republic and early Empire. A stronger emphasis was placed upon ranged combat ability of all types, such as field artillery, hand-held ''[[ballistae]]'', archery and darts. Roman forces also gradually became more mobile, with one cavalryman for every three infantryman, compared to one in forty in the early Empire.<ref>Elton, ''Warfare in Roman Europe'', p. 94<br>Santosuosso, ''Storming The Heavens'', p. 190</ref> Additionally, the Emperor [[Gallienus]] took the revolutionary step of forming an entirely cavalry field army, which was kept as a mobile reserve at the city of [[Milan]] in northern Italy. It is believed that Gallienus facilitated this concentration of cavalry by stripping the legions of their integral mounted element.<ref>Southern and Dixon, ''The Late Roman Army'', pp.&nbsp;11\u201312</ref> A diverse range of cavalry regiments existed, including ''[[Equites cataphractarii|catafractarii]]'' or ''clibanarii'', ''[[scutarii]]'', and legionary cavalry known as ''[[promoti]]''. Collectively, these regiments were known as ''equites''.<ref name=\"alfoldiP216\"/> Around 275&nbsp;AD, the proportion of ''catafractarii'' was also increased.<ref name=\"alfoldiP216\"/> There is some disagreement over exactly when the relative proportion of cavalry increased, whether Gallienus' reforms occurred contemporaneously with an increased reliance on cavalry, or whether these are two distinct events. Alfoldi appears to believe that Gallienus' reforms were contemporaneous with an increase in cavalry numbers. He argues that, by 258, Gallienus had made cavalry the predominant troop type in the Roman army in place of heavy infantry, which dominated earlier armies.<ref name=\"alfoldiP216\"/> According to [[Warren Treadgold]], however, the proportion of cavalry did not change between the early 3rd and early 4th centuries.<ref>Treadgold, ''Byzantium and its Army, 284\u20131081'', p. 56.</ref>\n\nLarger groups of ''barbari'' began to settle in Rome's territories around this time, and the troops they were contracted to provide to the Roman army were no longer organised as ''numeri'' but rather were the forerunners of the later rented native armies known as federated troops (Latin: ''[[foederati]]'').'''{{r|group=Note|D}}'''<ref name=\"alfoldiP212\">Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 212</ref> Though they served under Roman officers, the troops of these units were far more barbarised than the ''numeri'', lacked Romanisation of either military structure or personal ideology, and were ineligible for Roman citizenship upon discharge.<ref name=\"alfoldiP212\"/>  These native troops were not permitted to fight in native war bands under their own leaders, unlike the later ''foederati''; instead, these troops were split into small groups attached to other Roman units.<ref name=\"alfoldiP219\">Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 219</ref> They existed therefore as a halfway house between ''numeri'', who were encouraged to be Romanised, and the ''foederati'', who raised officers from their own ranks and were almost entirely self-dependent.\n\n==Comitatenses and limitanei (284\u2013395&nbsp;AD)==\n{{Main|Late Roman army|Scholae|Palatini (Roman military)|Comitatenses|Limitanei}}\n[[Image:Constantine arch troops.jpg|thumb|left|205px|Bearded Roman troops as pictured on a [[Arch of Constantine|triumphal arch]], c.&nbsp;312&nbsp;AD, however, the sculptured panels were re-used from earlier monuments of [[Trajanic]] date.]]\n\nA distinction between frontier guard troops and more mobile reserve forces had emerged with the use of certain troops to permanently man frontiers such as Hadrian's Wall in ''Britannia'' in the 2nd century&nbsp;AD. The competing demands of manned frontiers and strategic reserve forces had led to the division of the military into four types of troops by the early 4th century:\n\n* The ''[[limitanei]]'' or ''riparienses'' patrolled the border and defended the border fortifications.

The scholae were his personal guard, and were mainly equipped as cavalry. Vogt suggests that the ''scholae'' formed two small central reserves (Latin: ''scholae'') held to the strategic rear even of the ''comitatenses'', one each in the presence of the emperors of West and East respectively.<ref name=\"VogtP177\">Vogt, ''The Decline of Rome'', p. 177</ref>\n\nThe permanent field armies of the ''palatini'' and ''comitatenses'' ultimately derived from the temporary field armies of the earlier ''sacer comitatus''.\n\nCreated and expanded from the core troops of the Emperor's personal bodyguards,{{clarify|date=September 2013}} the central field armies by 295&nbsp;AD seem to have been too large to be accounted for as simple bodyguard forces, but were still too small to be able to campaign independently of legionary or vexillation support.{{clarify|date=September 2013}}<ref>Campbell, ''The Army'', p. 121</ref>\n\nOf the four troop types, the ''limitanei'' (border guards) were once considered to have been of the lowest quality,<ref>Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565 AD''. p. 452<br>* Grant, ''A History of Rome'', p. 333<br>* Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 188</ref> consisting largely of peasant-soldiers that were both \"grossly inferior\" to the earlier legions and inferior also to their counterparts in the mobile field armies.<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', pp. 154, 173</ref> However, more recent work establishes that the ''limitanei'' were regular soldiers.<ref name=Treadgold161>Treadgold 1995, p. 161.</ref><ref name=Strobel268>Strobel 2011, p. 268.</ref><ref name=\"Southern & Dixon, 1996, p. 57\"/>\n\nWhile the ''limitanei'' were supposed to deal with policing actions and low-intensity incursions, the duty of responding to more serious incidents fell upon the provincial troops.{{contradict-inline|date=September 2013}} The countering of the very largest scale incursions on a strategic scale was the task of the ''comitatenses'' and ''palatini'' or mobile field troops, possibly accompanied by the emperor's ''scholae''.

In the 3rd or 4th century, however, the legions' role as elite heavy infantry was substantially reduced<ref name=\"BV59\">Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565 AD''. p. 453<br>* Vogt, ''The Decline of Rome'', p. 59</ref> and may have evaporated entirely.<ref name=\"luttwakP175\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 175</ref> Instead, those \"legions\" that remained were no longer drawn exclusively (and perhaps hardly at all) from Roman citizens.<ref name=\"CaryP534\"/> Either Diocletian<ref>Brian Campbell, ''The Crisis of Empire'', p. 123</ref> or Constantine reorganised the legions into smaller infantry units<ref name=\"CaryP534\"/> who, according to some sources, were more lightly armoured than their forebears.<ref name=\"BV59\" /> Their lighter armament may have been either because they \"would not consent to wear the same weight of body armour as the legionaries of old\"<ref>Cary & Scullard, ''A History of Rome'', p. 535</ref> or, as in at least one documented instance, because they were prohibited from wearing heavy armour by their general in order to increase their mobility.<ref name=\"alfoldiP209\">Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 209</ref> 4th-century legions were at times only one sixth the size of early imperial legions, and they were armed with some combination of spears, bows, slings, darts and swords, reflecting a greater contemporary emphasis on ranged fighting.<ref>Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 209<br>* Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 175</ref> The ''auxilia'' and ''numeri'' had also largely disappeared.<ref name=\"alfoldiP213\">Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 213</ref> Constantine further increased the proportion of German troops in the regular army;<ref name=\"grantP310\">Grant, ''A History of Rome'', p. 310</ref> their cultural impact was so great that even legionaries began wearing German dress.<ref name=\"VogtP59\"/> At the start of Diocletian's reign, the Roman army numbered about 390,000 men, but by the end of his reign he successfully increased the number to 581,000 men.<ref name=\"army\">Treadgold, ''A History of Byzantine State and Society'', 19</ref>\n\n===Adoption of barbarian allies (358\u2013395&nbsp;AD)===\n\nBy the late 4th century, the Empire had become chronically deficient in raising sufficient troops from amongst its own population.<ref name=\"grantP334\">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 334</ref> As an alternative, taxation raised internally was increasingly used to subsidise growing numbers of barbarian recruits. The Romans had, for some time, recruited individual non-Roman soldiers into regular military units. In 358&nbsp;AD, this practice was accelerated by the wholescale adoption of the entire [[Salian Franks]] people into the Empire, providing a ready pool of such recruits. In return for being allowed to settle as ''[[foederatii]]'' in northern ''[[Gaul|Gallia]]'' on the near side of the [[Rhine]], the Franks were expected to defend the Empire's borders in their territory and provide troops to serve in Roman units.\n\nIn 376, a large band of [[Goths]] asked Emperor [[Valens]] for permission to settle on the southern bank of the [[Danube River]] on terms similar to the Franks. The Goths were also accepted into the empire as ''foederati''; however, they rebelled later that year and defeated the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]]. The heavy losses that the Roman military suffered during this defeat ironically forced the Roman Empire to rely still further on such ''foederati'' troops to supplement its forces.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapters 3\u201316.</ref> In 382, the practice was radically extended when federated troops were signed up ''[[en masse]]'' as allied contingents of ''laeti'' and ''foederatii'' troops separate from existing Roman units.<ref name=\"grantP334\"/> Near-constant civil wars during the period 408 and 433 between various Roman usurpers, emperors and their supposed deputies such as [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine III]], [[Constantius III]], [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] and [[Bonifacius]] resulted in further losses, necessitating the handing over of more taxable land to foederati.\n\nThe size and composition of these allied forces remains in dispute. Santosuosso argues that ''foederati'' regiments consisted mostly of cavalry<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 189</ref> that were raised both as a temporary levy for a specific campaign need and, in some cases, as a permanent addition to the army. Hugh Elton believes that the importance of ''foederati'' has been overstated in traditional accounts by historians such as A.H.M. Jones. Elton argues that the majority of soldiers were probably non-Italian Roman citizens,'''{{r|group=Note|F}}'''<ref>Elton, ''Warfare in Roman Europe'', pp. 145\u2013152.</ref>  while Santosuosso believes that the majority of troops were almost certainly non-citizen ''barbari''.<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 192</ref>\n\n==Collapse in the West and survival in the East (395\u2013476&nbsp;AD)==\n[[Image:Greatpalacemosaic.jpg|thumb|205px|right|Mosaic of what is presumed to be a Gothic war leader.

At the highest level of structure, the forces were split into the [[Roman army]] and the [[Roman navy]], although these two branches were less distinct than in many modern national defense forces. Within the top levels of both army and navy, structural changes occurred as a result of both positive military reform and organic structural evolution. These changes can be divided into four distinct phases.\n\n;Phase I: The army was derived from obligatory annual military service levied on the citizenry, as part of their [[social contract|duty to the state]]. During this period, the Roman army would wage seasonal campaigns against largely local adversaries.\n\n;Phase II: As the extent of the territories falling under Roman control expanded and the size of the forces increased, the soldiery gradually became salaried professionals. As a consequence, military service at the lower (non-salaried) levels became progressively longer-term. Roman military units of the period were largely homogeneous and highly regulated. The army consisted of units of citizen infantry known as [[Roman legion|legions]] (Latin: ''legiones'') as well as non-legionary allied troops known as ''[[auxilia]]''. The latter were most commonly called upon to provide light infantry, logistical, or cavalry support.\n\n;Phase III: At the height of the Roman Empire's power, forces were tasked with manning and securing the borders of the vast provinces which had been brought under Roman control. Serious strategic threats were less common in this period and emphasis was placed on preserving gained territory. The army underwent changes in response to these new needs and became more dependent on fixed garrisons than on march-camps and continuous field operations.\n\n;Phase IV: As Rome began to struggle to keep control over its sprawling territories, military service continued to be salaried and professional for Rome's regular troops. However, the trend of employing allied or mercenary elements was expanded to such an extent that these troops came to represent a substantial proportion of the armed forces. At the same time, the uniformity of structure found in Rome's earlier military disappeared. Soldiery of the era ranged from lightly armed mounted archers to heavy infantry, in regiments of varying size and quality. This was accompanied by a trend in the late empire of an increasing predominance of cavalry rather than infantry troops, as well as a requirement for more mobile operations. In this period there was more focus (on all frontiers but the east) on smaller units of independently-operating troops, engaging less in set-piece battles and more in low-intensity, guerilla actions.\n\n==Tribal forces (c. 752 BC \u2013 c. 578 BC)==\n{{Main|Early Roman army}}\nAccording to the historians [[Livy]] and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], writing at a far later date, the earliest Roman army existed in the 8th century&nbsp;BC. During this period Rome itself was probably little more than a fortified hilltop settlement and its army a relatively small force, whose activities were limited \"mainly [to] raiding and cattle rustling with the occasional skirmish-like battle\".<ref name=\"goldsworthyP18\">Goldsworthy, ''In the Name of Rome'', p. 18</ref> Historian [[Theodor Mommsen]] referred to it as Rome's ''curiate'' army, named for its presumed subdivision along the boundaries of Rome's three founding tribes (Latin: ''[[curia]]e''), the [[Ramnians]], [[Tities (roman tribe)|Tities]] and [[Luceres]].<ref>Mommsen, ''The History of Rome'', Volume 1, p. 40</ref>  This army's exact structure is not known, but it is probable that it loosely resembled a warrior band or group of bodyguards led by a chieftain or king.<ref>Keppie, ''The Making of the Roman Army'', p. 14</ref> Mommsen believes that Roman military organization of this period was regimented by the \"Laws of [the apocryphal] King [V]Italus\"<ref name=mommsen22>Mommsen, ''The History of Rome'', Volume 1, p. 22</ref> but these laws, though referred to by [[Aristotle]], have been lost.\n\nThe army (Latin: ''legio'') consisted, according to Livy, of exactly 3,000 infantry and 300 horsemen, one third from each of Rome's three founding tribes.'''{{r|group=Note|A}}'''<ref name=\"grantP22\">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 22<br>* Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565&nbsp;AD'', p. 69</ref>  Warriors served under six \"leaders of division\" (Latin: ''tribuni'') who in turn served under a general, usually in the person of the reigning King. Mommsen uses [[philological]] arguments and references from Livy and others to suggest that the greater mass of foot-soldiers probably consisted of ''[[pilumni]]'' (javelin-throwers), with a smaller number possibly serving as ''[[arquites]]'' (archers).<ref name=mommsen20>Mommsen, ''The History of Rome'', Volume 1, p. 20</ref> The cavalry was far smaller in number and probably consisted solely of the town's richest citizens.<ref name=Boak69>Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565&nbsp;AD'', p. 69</ref> The army may also have contained the earliest form of chariots,<ref>Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565&nbsp;AD'', p. 86</ref> hinted at by references to the ''flexuntes'' (\"the wheelers\").<ref>Mommsen, ''The History of Rome'', Volume 1, p. 65</ref>\n\nBy the beginning of the 7th century&nbsp;BC, the [[Iron-Age]] [[Etruscans|Etruscan civilization]] (Latin: ''Etrusci'') was dominant in the region.<ref>Livy, ''The Rise of Rome'', Book 5, chapter 33<br>* Pallottino, ''The Etruscans'', p. 68</ref> Like most of the other peoples in the region, the Romans warred against the Etruscans. By the close of the century, the Romans had lost their struggle for independence, and the Etruscans had conquered Rome, establishing a military dictatorship, or kingdom, in the city.\n\n==Etruscan-model hoplites (578&nbsp;BC \u2013 c. 315&nbsp;BC)==\n{{Main|Early Roman army}}\n[[Image:Helmed Hoplite Sparta.JPG|thumb|205px|right|Ancient Greek sculpture of a [[hoplite]] (c.&nbsp;5th century&nbsp;BC, Arch\u00e6ological Museum of [[Sparti (municipality)|Sparti]]), on which Rome's first class of infantry was based.]]\nAlthough several Roman sources including [[Livy]] and [[Polybius]] talk extensively about the Roman army of the [[Roman Kingdom]] period that followed the Etruscan capture of the city, no contemporary accounts survive. Polybius, for example, was writing some 300 years after the events in question, and Livy some 500 years later. Additionally, what records were kept by the Romans at this time were later destroyed when the city was sacked. The sources for this period cannot therefore be seen as reliable, as they can be for later military history, e.g. from the [[First Punic War]] onwards.\n\nAccording to our surviving narratives, the three kings of Rome during the Etruscan occupation were [[Tarquinius Priscus]], [[Servius Tullius]], and [[Tarquinius Superbus]]. During this period the army underwent a reformation into a ''centurial'' army based on socio-economic class.<ref name=\"Livy42\">Livy, ''The Rise of Rome'', Book 1, chapter 42</ref> [[Servian constitution|This reformation]] is traditionally attributed to Servius Tullius, the second of the [[Roman Kingdom|Etruscan kings]]. Tullius had earlier carried out the first Roman census of all citizens.<ref name=\"Livy43\">Livy, ''The Rise of Rome'', Book 1, chapter 43</ref> Livy tells us that Tullius reformed the army by transplanting onto it the structure derived originally for civil life as a result of this census.<ref name=\"Livy42\"/> At all levels, military service was, at this time, considered to be a civic responsibility and a way of advancing one's status within society.<ref name=\"smithP10\">Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 10</ref>\n\nHowever, Rome's social classes were qualified rather than created by the census. It is perhaps more accurate to say therefore that the army's structure was slightly refined during this period rather than radically reformed. Prior to these reforms, the infantry was divided into the ''classis'' of rich citizens and the ''infra classem'' of poorer citizens. The latter were excluded from the regular line of battle on the basis that their equipment was of poor quality.<ref name=Boak69/> During the reforms, this crude division of poorer and richer citizens was further stratified. The army thereafter consisted of a number of troop types based upon the social class of propertied citizens, collectively known as ''[[adsidui]]''. From the poorest in the \"fifth class\" to the richest in the \"first class\" and the [[Roman equestrian order|equestrians]] above them, military service was compulsory for all.<ref name=\"gabbaP2\">Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army And the Allies'', p.  2</ref> However, Roman citizens at this time generally viewed military service as a proper undertaking of duty to the state, in contrast to later views of military service as an unwelcome and unpleasant burden.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 334<br>* Boak, ''A History of Rome'', p. 454</ref> Whereas there are accounts of Romans in the late empire mutilating their own bodies in order to exempt themselves from military service,<ref>Campbell, ''The Crisis of Empire'', p. 126<br>* Boak, ''A History of Rome'', p. 454</ref> there seems to have been no such reluctance to serve in the military of early Rome. This may in part be due to the generally lower intensity of conflict in this era; to the fact that men were fighting close to and often in protection of their own homes, or due to\u2014as posited by later Roman writers\u2014a greater martial spirit in antiquity.'''{{r|group=Note|B}}'''<ref name=\"vogtP158\">Vogt, ''The Decline of Rome'', p. 158</ref>\n\nThe equestrians, the highest social class of all, served in mounted units known as ''[[equites]]''. The [[Servius Tullius#Classes|first class]] of the richest citizens served as heavy infantry with swords and long spears (resembling [[hoplite]]s), and provided the first line of the battle formation. The [[Servius Tullius#Classes|second class]] were armed similarly to the first class, but without a [[breastplate]] for protection, and with an oblong rather than a round shield. The second class stood immediately behind the first class when the army was drawn up in battle formation. The [[Servius Tullius#Classes|third and fourth classes]] were more lightly armed and carried a thrusting-spear and javelins. The third class stood behind the second class in battle formation, normally providing javelin support. The poorest of the propertied men of the city comprised the [[Servius Tullius#Classes|fifth class]]. They were generally too poor to afford much equipment at all and were armed as skirmishers with [[Sling (weapon)|slings]] and stones. They were deployed in a screen in front of the main army, covering its approach and masking its manoeuvres.\n\nMen without property, who were thereby excluded from the qualifying social classes of the ''[[adsidui]]'', were exempted from military service on the grounds that they were too poor to provide themselves with any arms whatsoever.<ref name=\"Livy42\"/> However, in the most pressing circumstances, even these ''[[proletarii]]'' were pressed into service,<ref name=\"Gabba, Republican Rome, p. 5\">Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army And the Allies'', p. 5</ref> though their military worth was probably questionable. Troops in all of these classes would fight together on the battlefield, with the exception of the most senior troops, who were expected to guard the city.<ref name=\"Livy43\"/>\n\nThe army is said to have increased from 3,000 to 4,000 men in the 5th century BC, and then again from 4,000 to 6,000 men sometime before 400 BC.<ref name=Boak69 /> This later army of 6,000 men were then divided into 60 ''centuries'' of 100 men each.<ref name=\"grantP24\">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 24</ref>\n\n==Manipular legion (315\u2013107&nbsp;BC)==\n{{Main|Roman army of the mid-Republic}}\n[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3bis.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus]], c. 122 BC; the altar shows two Roman infantrymen equipped with long ''[[Scutum (shield)|scuta]]'' and a cavalryman with his horse.

However, in contrast to later legionary formations of exclusively heavy infantry, the legions of the early and middle Republic consisted of both light and heavy infantry. The term ''manipular legion'', a legion based on units called [[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]], is therefore used to contrast the later ''cohortal'' legion of the Empire that was based around a system of ''cohort'' units. The manipular legion was based partially upon social class and partially upon age and military experience.<ref>Boak, '' A History of Rome to 565 A.D.'', p. 87</ref> It therefore represents a theoretical compromise between the earlier class-based army and the class-free armies of later years. In practice, even slaves were at one time pressed into the army of the Republic out of necessity.<ref name=\"santosuossoP10\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 10</ref> Normally a single legion was raised each year, but in 366&nbsp;BC two legions were raised in a single year for the first time.<ref name=Boak69/>\n\n''Maniples'' were units of 120 men each drawn from a single infantry class. The maniples were small enough to permit tactical movement of individual infantry units on the battlefield within the framework of the greater army. The maniples were typically deployed into three discrete lines (Latin: ''triplex acies'') based on the three heavy infantry types of ''[[hastati]]'', ''[[principes]]'' and ''[[triarii]]''.<ref name=\"santosuossoP18\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 18</ref> The first type, the ''hastati'', typically formed the first rank in battle formation.  They typically wore a brass chest plate (though some could afford mail), a helmet called a galea, and occasionally, greaves (shin guards). They carried an iron bossed wooden shield, 120&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;ft) tall and rectangular in shape with a curved front to partially protect the sides. Traditionally they were armed with a sword known as a ''[[gladius]]'' and two [[throwing spear]]s known as ''[[pilum|pila]]'': one the heavy ''pilum'' of popular imagination and one a slender javelin.<ref name=\"polybiusB6\">Polybius, ''History'', Book 6</ref> However the exact introduction of the Gladius and the replacement of the spear with the sword as the primary weapon of the Roman Legions is uncertain, and it's possible that the early manipular legions still fought with the Hastati and Principes wielding the Hasta or Spear.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" | \"the Romans&nbsp;... habitually enroll four legions each year, each consisting of about four thousand foot and two hundred horse; and when any unusual necessity arises, they raise the number of foot to five thousand and of the horse to three hundred.

They were heavy infantry soldiers armed and armoured as per the hastati.  The ''triarii'', who typically formed the third rank when the army was arrayed for battle, were the last remnant of hoplite-style troops in the Roman army. They were armed and armoured as per the ''principes'', with the exception that they carried a [[pike (weapon)|pike]] rather than two ''pila''.<ref name=\"polybiusB6\"/> A 600-man triarii maniple was divided into two formations each six men across by 10 men deep.<ref name=\"manip\">[http://www.strategypage.com/articles/default.asp?target=marius/manipletocohort From Maniple to Cohort], Strategy Page</ref> A manipular legion typically contained between 1,200-2400 ''hastati'', 1,200-2400 ''principes'' and 600-1200 ''triarii''.<ref name=\"LuttwakP40\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 40</ref> The three classes of unit may have retained some slight parallel to social divisions within Roman society, but at least officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven men would serve as ''hastati'', older men with some military experience as ''principes'', and veteran troops of advanced age and experience as ''triarii''.\n\nThe heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry (Latin: ''[[velites]]'') and cavalry (Latin: ''[[equites]]'') troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion.<ref name=\"santosuossoP18\"/> The cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest class of equestrians, but additional cavalry and light infantry were drawn at times from the [[socii]] and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latini]] of the Italian mainland. The ''equites'' were still drawn from the [[Equestrian (Roman)|wealthier]] classes in Roman society. There was an additional class of troops (Latin: ''[[accensi]]'', also ''adscripticii'' and later ''supernumerarii'') who followed the army without specific martial roles and were deployed to the rear of the ''triarii''. Their role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in the maniples, but they also seem to have acted occasionally as orderlies to the officers.\n\nThe light infantry of 1,200 ''velites''<ref name=\"santosuossoP18\"/> consisted of unarmoured skirmishing troops drawn from the youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and [[shield]] (90&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;ft) diameter), as well as several light javelins, each with a 90&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;ft) wooden shaft the diameter of a finger, with a c.&nbsp;25&nbsp;cm (10&nbsp;in) narrow metal point.<ref name=\"polybiusB6\"/> Their numbers were swollen by the addition of allied light infantry and irregular ''[[rorarii]]''.\n\nThe Roman levy of 403&nbsp;BC was the first to be requested to campaign for longer than a single season,<ref>Livy, ''The Rise of Rome'', Book 5, ch. 1</ref> and from this point on such a practice became gradually more common, if still not typical.\n\nA small navy had operated at a fairly low level after the [[Second Samnite War]], but it was massively upgraded during this period, expanding from a few primarily river- and coastal-based patrol craft to a full maritime unit. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size. This was partially because a pacified Roman Mediterranean called for little naval policing, and partially because the Romans chose to rely during this period on ships provided by Greek cities, whose peoples had greater maritime experience.<ref name=\"websterP156\">Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 156</ref>\n\n===Proletarianisation of the infantry (217\u2013107&nbsp;BC)===\nThe extraordinary demands of the [[Punic Wars]], in addition to a shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, at least in the short term.<ref>Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 2</ref> In 217&nbsp;BC, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners when slaves were pressed into naval service;<ref name=\"santosuossoP10\"/> around 213&nbsp;BC, the property requirement was reduced from 11,000 to 4,000 [[As (coin)|asses]].<ref name=\"santosuossoP10\"/> Since the Romans are unlikely to have preferred to employ slaves over poor citizens in their armies,<ref name=\"Gabba, Republican Rome, p. 5\"/> it must be assumed that, at this point, the ''proletarii'' of the poorest citizens must also have been pressed into service despite their lack of legal qualification. By 123&nbsp;BC, the financial requirement for military service was slashed again from 4,000 asses to just 1,500 asses.<ref name=\"gabbaP7\">Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 7</ref> By this time, therefore, it is clear that many of the property-less former ''proletarii'' had been nominally admitted into the ''[[adsidui]]''.<ref name=\"gabbaP7\"/>\n\nDuring the 2nd century&nbsp;BC, Roman territory saw an overall decline in population,<ref name=\"gabbaP9\">Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 9</ref> partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes into lower classes of the census and the ''proletarii''.<ref name=\"gabbaP9\"/> As a result, both the Roman society and its military became increasingly proletarianised. The Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state, since many of the soldiers who made up its lower classes were now impoverished ''proletarii'' in all but name, and were too poor to afford their own equipment.<ref name=\"gabbaP9\"/>\n\nThe distinction between the heavy infantry types of ''hastati'', ''principes'' and ''triarii'' began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment to all but the first class of troops, who alone were able to afford their own equipment.<ref name=\"gabbaP9\"/> By the time of Polybius, the ''triarii'' or their successors still represented a distinct heavy infantry type armed with a unique style of cuirass, but the ''hastati'' and ''principes'' had become indistinguishable.<ref name=\"gabbaP9\"/>\n\nIn addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon its allies (''socii'') for the provision of allied troops.<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 11</ref> Where accepted allies could not provide the required force types, the Romans were not averse during this period to hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.<ref>Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 143</ref>\n\n==Marian legion (107\u201327&nbsp;BC)==\n[[Image:Marius Glyptothek Munich 319.jpg|thumb|205px|right|Bust of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]], instigator of the [[Marian reforms]]]]\n{{Main|Roman army of the late Republic}}\nIn a process known as the [[Marian reforms]], [[Roman consul]] [[Gaius Marius]] carried out a programme of reform of the Roman military.<ref name=\"santosuossoP10\"/> In 107&nbsp;BC, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army.<ref>Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565 A.D.'', p. 189<br>* Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 10</ref> This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property requirements for military service.<ref>Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army And the Allies'', p. 1</ref> The distinction between ''hastati'', ''principes'' and ''triarii'', which had already become blurred, was officially removed,<ref name=\"santosuossoP18\"/><ref>Cary & Scullard, ''A History of Rome'', p. 219</ref> and the [[Roman legion|legionary infantry]] of popular imagination was created. Legionary infantry formed a homogeneous force of [[heavy infantry]]. These legionaries were drawn from citizen stock; by this time, Roman or Latin citizenship had been regionally expanded over much of ancient Italy and [[Cisalpine Gaul]].<ref name=\"luttwakP27\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 27</ref> Lighter citizen infantry, such as the ''velites'' and ''equites'', were replaced by non-citizen ''[[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxilia]]'' that could consist of foreign [[mercenaries]].<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 16</ref> Due to the concentration of the citizen legions into a force of heavy infantry<ref name=\"LuttwakP40\"/> Rome's armies depended on auxiliary cavalry attachments for support. As a tactical necessity, legions were almost always accompanied by an equal or greater number of lighter auxiliary troops,<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'', IV, 5</ref> which were drawn from the non-citizens of the Empire's territories. One known exception of legions being formed from non-citizen provinces during this period was the legion that was raised in the province of [[Galatia]].<ref name=\"luttwakP27\"/>\n\nAfter Marius, the legions were drawn largely from volunteer citizens rather than citizens conscripted for duty.<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 16</ref> Volunteers came forward and were accepted not from citizens of the city of Rome itself but from the surrounding countryside and smaller towns falling under Roman control.<ref name=\"SantosuossoP29\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 29</ref> Whereas some long-term military professionals were classed as [[veteran]]s, they were outnumbered by civilians with limited military experience who were in active service perhaps only for a few campaigns.<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 51</ref> The legions of the late Republic remained, unlike the legions of the later Empire, predominantly Roman in origin, although some small number of ex-auxiliary troops were probably incorporated.<ref>Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 56</ref> The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.<ref name=\"SantosuossoP29\"/>\n\nUnlike earlier in the Republic, legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land.'''{{r|group=Note|C}}''' Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a fixed-term basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest sections of society, to whom a guaranteed salary was attractive.<ref name=\"gabbaP25\">Gabba, ''Republican Rome, The Army and The Allies'', p. 25</ref> The army therefore consisted of a far higher proportion of the poor\u2014particularly the rural poor\u2014than it had previously.<ref>Boak, ''A History of Rome'', p. 189</ref> A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat \"acquired a stronger and more elevated position\"<ref name=\"gabbaP25\"/> within the state. This professionalisation of the military was necessary to provide permanent garrisons for newly acquired and distant territories such as [[Hispania]], something not possible under an army of seasonal citizen militia.\n\nHistorian R. E. Smith notes that there was a need to raise additional legions in an emergency to repel specific strategic threats. He argues that this may have resulted in two types of legion.<ref name=\"smithP29\">Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 29</ref> Long-standing legions deployed overseas were probably professional troops forming a standing army. Quickly-formed new legions, in contrast, consisted of younger men, perhaps with little or no military experience, who hoped for adventure and plunder.<ref name=\"smithP29\"/> However, no distinction in basic pay, discipline or armour is known of between the two types of legion. The practice of veteran troops signing up again voluntarily into newly raised legions must have meant that no one army conformed exactly to one or other of these theoretical archetypes.\n\nThe legions of the late Republic were, structurally, almost entirely heavy infantry. The legion's main sub-unit was called a ''[[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]]'' and consisted of approximately 480 infantrymen.<ref name=\"luttwakP14\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 14</ref> The cohort was therefore a much larger unit than the earlier ''maniple'' sub-unit, and was divided into six [[Centuria#Military|centuriae]] of 80 men each.<ref name=\"luttwakP14\"/> Each centuria was separated further into 10 \"tent groups\" (Latin: ''[[contubernia]]'') of 8 men each. Legions additionally consisted of a small body, typically 120 men, of Roman legionary cavalry (Latin: ''[[equites legionis]]''). The ''equites'' were used as scouts and dispatch riders rather than battlefield cavalry.<ref>Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 116</ref> Legions also contained a dedicated artillery crew of perhaps 60 men, who would operate devices such as ''[[ballistae]]''.<ref name=\"luttwakP14\"/>\n\nEach legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied (non-Roman) ''auxiliae'' troops.<ref name=\"luttwakP15\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 15</ref> The addition of allied troops to the Roman army was a formalisation of the earlier arrangement of using light troops from the [[Socii]] and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latini]], who had received Roman citizenship after the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]].<ref>Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 27</ref> Auxiliary troops could be formed from either auxiliary light cavalry known as ''[[Ala (Roman military)|alae]]'', auxiliary light infantry known as ''cohors auxiliae'', or a flexible mixture of the two known as ''cohors equitata''.<ref name=\"luttwakP15\"/> Cavalry types included mounted archers (Latin: ''[[Horse archer|sagittarii]]'') and heavy shock cavalry (Latin: ''[[cataphracti]]'' or ''[[clibanarii]]''). Infantry could be armed with bows, slings, throwing spears, long swords, or thrusting spears. Auxiliary units were originally led by their own chiefs, and, in this period, their internal organisation was left to their commanders.<ref name=\"WebsterP146\">Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 146</ref>\n\nHowever, \"the most obvious deficiency\" of the Roman army remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry;<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 43</ref> even auxiliary troops were predominantly infantry. Luttwak argues that auxiliary forces largely consisted of [[Crete|Cretan]] archers, [[Balearics|Balearic]] slingers and [[Numidia]]n infantry, all of whom fought on foot.<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 44</ref> As Rome's borders expanded and its adversaries changed from largely infantry-based to largely cavalry-based troops, the infantry-based Roman army began to find itself at a tactical disadvantage, particularly in the East.\n\nAfter having declined in size following the subjugation of the Mediterranean, the Roman navy underwent short-term upgrading and revitalisation in the late Republic to meet several new demands. Under [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], an invasion fleet was assembled in the [[English Channel]] to allow the invasion of [[Roman Britain|Britain]]; under [[Pompey]], a large fleet was raised in the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea of [[Cilicia]]n pirates.<ref name=\"websterP156\"/> During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities.<ref name=\"websterP156\"/>\n\n===Non-citizen recruitment (49\u201327&nbsp;BC)===\nBy the time of [[Julius Caesar]] in 54&nbsp;BC, regular legionary units were supplemented by ''[[exploratores]]'', a body of scouts, and ''[[speculatores]]'', spies who infiltrated enemy camps.<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 67</ref> Due to the demands of the civil war, the extraordinary measure of recruiting legions from non-citizens was taken by Caesar in [[Transalpine Gaul]] (Latin: ''Gallia Transalpina''), by [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], and by [[Pompey]] in [[Pharsalus]].<ref>Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 57</ref> This irregular and extraordinary recruitment was not, however, typical of recruitment during this period, and Roman law still officially required that legions were recruited from Roman citizens only.\n\n==Imperial legions and reformation of the auxilia (27&nbsp;BC \u2013 117&nbsp;AD)==\n{{Main|Imperial Roman army}}\n\nBy the turn of the millennium, Emperor [[Augustus]]' primary military concern was to prevent Roman generals from further usurping the imperial throne.<ref name=\"smithP71\">Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 71</ref> The experience of Caesar and, earlier, Marius and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], had demonstrated the willingness of \"emergency\" (re-activated previously decommissioned) legions containing troops keen for plunder to follow their generals against the state. Augustus therefore removed the need for such emergency armies by increasing the size of the standing armies to a size sufficient to provide territorial defence on their own.<ref>Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565 A.D.'', p. 270<br>* Smith, ''Service in the Post-Marian Roman Army'', p. 71</ref> Perhaps due to similar concerns, the legions and auxiliaries of the army were supplemented under the Emperor Augustus by an elite formation of guards dedicated to the protection of the Emperor. The first such unit was based in Rome and were known as the [[Praetorian Guard]], and a second similar formation were known as the [[Cohortes urbanae]].<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 17<br>* Grant, ''A History of Rome'', p. 209</ref>\n\nThe legions, which had been a mix of life professionals and civilian campaigners, was altered into a standing army of professionals only.<ref name=\"santosuossoP91\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 91</ref> The actual structure of the cohort army remained much the same as in the late Republic, although around the 1st century&nbsp;AD the first cohort of each legion was increased in size to a total of 800 soldiers.<ref>Hassall, ''The Army'', p. 325<br>* Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 91</ref> However, while the structure of the legions remained much the same, their make-up gradually changed. Whereas early Republican legions had been raised by a draft from eligible Roman citizens, imperial legions were recruited solely on a voluntary basis and from a much wider base of manpower. Likewise, whereas Republican legions had been recruited almost exclusively in Italy, early Imperial legions drew most of their recruits from Roman colonies in the provinces from 68&nbsp;AD onwards. One estimate places the proportion of Italian troops at 65% under Augustus in c.&nbsp;1&nbsp;AD, falling to around 49% by the end of Nero's reign.<ref name=\"santosuossoP98\">Santosuosso, Storming the Heavens, p. 98</ref>\n[[Image:2005-12-28 Berlin Pergamon museum (16).jpg|thumb|left|205px|[[Relief depicting a Roman legionary (Berlin SK 887)|Bas-relief carving of a Roman legionary]] out of battle dress, c.&nbsp;1st century&nbsp;AD ([[Pergamon Museum]], [[Berlin]])]]\nSince the legions were officially open only to Roman citizens, Max Cary and [[Howard Hayes Scullard]] argue that at least in some provinces at this time \"many provincials must have been recruited who lacked any genuine claim to Roman citizenship but received it unofficially on enlistment,\"<ref>Cary & Scullard, ''A History of Rome'', p. 338</ref> a practice that was to increase in the 2nd century.<ref>Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter I, p. 36</ref> This is most likely in those provinces where the pool of Roman citizens was not large enough to fulfill the provincial army's recruitment needs. One possible example is [[Roman Britain|Britain]], where one estimate puts the citizen pool in the 1st century at only 50,000 out of a total provincial population of around two million.<ref>Mattingly, ''An Imperial Possession - Britain in the Roman Empire'', pp. 166\u20138</ref>\n\nAt the same time as the legions underwent these transformations, the ''auxilia'' were reorganized and a number of allied troops were formalised into standing units similar to legions. Rather than being raised re-actively when required, the process of raising auxiliary troops was carried out in advance of conflicts according to annual targets.<ref>Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 144</ref> Whereas the internal organisation of the ''auxilia'' had previously been left up to their commanders, in the early empire they were organised into standardised units known as ''turmae'' (for cavalry ''alae'') and ''centuriae'' (for infantry ''cohortes'').<ref name=\"WebsterP146\"/> Although never becoming as standardised in their equipment as the legions,<ref>Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 152</ref> and often retaining some national flavour, the size of the units at least was standardised to some degree. Cavalry were formed into either an ''ala quingenaria'' of 512 horsemen, or an ''ala millaria'' of 1,000 horsemen.<ref name=\"luttwakP15\"/> Likewise, infantry auxilia could be formed into a ''cohors quingenaria'' of 500 men or a ''cohors millaria'' of 1,000 men.<ref name=\"luttwakP15\"/> Mixed cavalry/infantry auxiliaries were typically formed with a larger proportion of foot than horse troops: the ''cohors equitata quingenaria'' consisted of 380 foot and 120 horsemen, and the ''cohors equitata millaria'' consisted of 760 foot and 240 horsemen.<ref name=\"luttwakP15\"/>\n\nThe vitality of the empire at this point was such that the use of native ''auxilia'' in the Roman army did not apparently barbarise the military as some scholars claim was to happen in the late empire.<ref name=\"WebsterP150\">Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 150</ref> On the contrary, those serving in the ''auxilia''  during this period frequently strove to Romanise themselves. They were granted Roman citizenship on retirement, granting them several social advantages, and their sons became eligible for service in the legions.<ref>Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 147</ref>\n\nAs with the army, many non-Italians were recruited into the Roman Navy, partly because  the Romans had never readily taken to the sea. It appears that the navy was considered to be slightly less prestigious than the ''auxilia'' but, like the ''auxilia'', troops could gain citizenship on discharge upon retirement. In terms of structure, each ship was staffed by a group of men approximately equivalent to a century, with ten ships forming a naval squadron.<ref name=\"websterP165\">Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army'', p. 165</ref>\n\n===Introduction of vexillationes (76\u2013117&nbsp;AD)===\n[[Image:Roman soldiers with marching packs 02.JPG|thumb|right|205px|Roman soldiers of around 101&nbsp;AD from a cast of Trajan's column, c.&nbsp;113&nbsp;AD ([[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[London]])]]\nThrough the final years of the 1st century&nbsp;AD, the legions remained the backbone of the Roman army, although the ''auxilia'' in fact outnumbered them by up to half as much again.<ref>Hassall, ''The High Empire, AD&nbsp;70\u2013192'', p. 320</ref> Within the legions, the proportion of troops recruited from within Italy fell gradually after 70&nbsp;AD.<ref name =\"hassallP331\">Hassall, ''The High Empire, AD&nbsp;70\u2013192'', p. 331</ref> By the close of the 1st century, this proportion had fallen to as low as 22 percent, with the remainder drawn from conquered provinces.<ref name=\"santosuossoP98\"/> Since technically only citizens were allowed to enlist in the legions, where recruits did not possess citizenship then, at least in some instances, citizenship \"was simply given [to] them on enlistment\".<ref>Hassall, ''The High Empire, AD 70\u2013192'', p. 331<br>* Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter I, p. 36</ref> During this time, the borders of the Empire had remained relatively fixed to the extent originally reached under the Emperor [[Trajan]]. Because of this, the army was increasingly responsible for protecting existing frontiers rather than expanding into foreign territory, the latter of which had characterised the army's earlier existence.<ref name=\"alfoldiP211\">Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 211</ref> As a result, legions became stationed in largely fixed locations. Although entire legions were occasionally transferred into theatres of war, they remained largely rooted in one or more legionary bases in a province, detaching into smaller bodies of troops (Latin: ''[[vexillationes]]'') on demand.<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 124</ref> This policy eventually led to a split of the military's land-based forces into mobile and fixed troops in the later Empire. In general, the best troops were dispatched as ''vexillationes'', and the remainder left to guard border defences were of lower quality, perhaps those with injuries or near retirement.<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', pp. 153\u2013154</ref>\n\n==Barbarisation of the army (117\u2013253&nbsp;AD)==\n[[File:Sarcofago dio portonaccio, 03.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Battle with [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] troops, on the [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]] (190-200)]]\n\nBy the time of the emperor [[Hadrian]] the proportion of Italians in the legions had fallen to just ten percent<ref name=\"santosuossoP98\"/> and provincial citizens now dominated. This low figure is probably a direct result of the changing needs of military staffing: a system of fixed border defences (Latin: ''[[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]'') were established around the Empire's periphery under Hadrian, consolidating Trajan's territorial gains. These called for troops to be stationed permanently in the provinces, a prospect more attractive to locally raised rather than Italian troops.<ref name=\"santosuossoP98\"/> The higher prestige and pay to be found in the Italian dominated [[Praetorian Guard]] must also have played a role. The majority of the troops in the legions at the start of the 3rd century&nbsp;AD were from the more Romanised (though non-Italian) provinces, especially [[Illyria]].<ref name=\"alfoldiP208\">Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 208</ref> As the century progressed, more and more barbarians (Latin: ''[[barbarian|barbari]]'') were permitted to settle inside of, and tasked with aiding in the defence of, Rome's borders.<ref name=\"vogtP58\">Vogt, ''The Decline of Rome'', p. 58.</ref> As a result, greater numbers of barbarous and semi-barbarous peoples were gradually admitted to the army.<ref name=\"alfoldiP208\"/>\n[[Image:Grande Ludovisi Altemps Inv8574.jpg|thumb|right|250px|3rd-century Roman soldiers battling barbarian troops on the [[Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus]] (250-260)]]\n\nHowever, whether this regionalisation of the legions was partnered by a drop in the professionalism of the troops is contested. [[Antonio Santosuosso]] argues that the strict discipline and high motivation of the days of Marius had lapsed,<ref name=\"santosuossoP173\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 173</ref> but Andrew Alfoldi states that the Illyrian troops were both valiant and warlike,<ref name=\"alfoldiP208\"/> and [[Tacitus]] described [[Germanic peoples|German]] recruits as being natural mercenaries (Latin: ''vivi ad arma nati'').<ref>Tacitus, ''History'', 4, 64</ref> It seems that discipline in the legions did slacken, with soldiers granted permission to live with wives outside of military lodgings and permitted to adopt a more lavish and comfortable lifestyle, in contrast to the strict military regimen of earlier years.<ref name=\"santosuossoP173\"/> However, it is by no means certain that this led to any reduction in the effectiveness of the legions, due to the greater ferocity and stature of the ''barbari'' recruits.  The flavour of the Roman military, however, was now dictated by the increasing number of regional recruits, leading to a partial barbarisation of Rome's military forces beginning in this period.<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 174</ref> The barbarisation of the lower ranks was paralleled by a concurrent barbarisation of its command structure, with the Roman senators who had traditionally provided its commanders becoming entirely excluded from the army. By 235&nbsp;AD the [[Maximinus Thrax|Emperor himself]], the figurehead of the entire military, was a man born outside of Italy to non-Italian parents.<ref name=\"santosuossoP175\">Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 175</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"A young nobleman, strong of hand and quick of mind and far more intelligent than your average barbarian&nbsp;... the ardour of his face and eyes showed the burning spirit within.

A stronger emphasis was placed upon ranged combat ability of all types, such as field artillery, hand-held ''[[ballistae]]'', archery and darts. Roman forces also gradually became more mobile, with one cavalryman for every three infantryman, compared to one in forty in the early Empire.<ref>Elton, ''Warfare in Roman Europe'', p. 94<br>Santosuosso, ''Storming The Heavens'', p. 190</ref> Additionally, the Emperor [[Gallienus]] took the revolutionary step of forming an entirely cavalry field army, which was kept as a mobile reserve at the city of [[Milan]] in northern Italy. It is believed that Gallienus facilitated this concentration of cavalry by stripping the legions of their integral mounted element.<ref>Southern and Dixon, ''The Late Roman Army'', pp.&nbsp;11\u201312</ref> A diverse range of cavalry regiments existed, including ''[[Equites cataphractarii|catafractarii]]'' or ''clibanarii'', ''[[scutarii]]'', and legionary cavalry known as ''[[promoti]]''. Collectively, these regiments were known as ''equites''.<ref name=\"alfoldiP216\"/> Around 275&nbsp;AD, the proportion of ''catafractarii'' was also increased.<ref name=\"alfoldiP216\"/> There is some disagreement over exactly when the relative proportion of cavalry increased, whether Gallienus' reforms occurred contemporaneously with an increased reliance on cavalry, or whether these are two distinct events. Alfoldi appears to believe that Gallienus' reforms were contemporaneous with an increase in cavalry numbers. He argues that, by 258, Gallienus had made cavalry the predominant troop type in the Roman army in place of heavy infantry, which dominated earlier armies.<ref name=\"alfoldiP216\"/> According to [[Warren Treadgold]], however, the proportion of cavalry did not change between the early 3rd and early 4th centuries.<ref>Treadgold, ''Byzantium and its Army, 284\u20131081'', p. 56.</ref>\n\nLarger groups of ''barbari'' began to settle in Rome's territories around this time, and the troops they were contracted to provide to the Roman army were no longer organised as ''numeri'' but rather were the forerunners of the later rented native armies known as federated troops (Latin: ''[[foederati]]'').'''{{r|group=Note|D}}'''<ref name=\"alfoldiP212\">Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 212</ref> Though they served under Roman officers, the troops of these units were far more barbarised than the ''numeri'', lacked Romanisation of either military structure or personal ideology, and were ineligible for Roman citizenship upon discharge.<ref name=\"alfoldiP212\"/>  These native troops were not permitted to fight in native war bands under their own leaders, unlike the later ''foederati''; instead, these troops were split into small groups attached to other Roman units.<ref name=\"alfoldiP219\">Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 219</ref> They existed therefore as a halfway house between ''numeri'', who were encouraged to be Romanised, and the ''foederati'', who raised officers from their own ranks and were almost entirely self-dependent.\n\n==Comitatenses and limitanei (284\u2013395&nbsp;AD)==\n{{Main|Late Roman army|Scholae|Palatini (Roman military)|Comitatenses|Limitanei}}\n[[Image:Constantine arch troops.jpg|thumb|left|205px|Bearded Roman troops as pictured on a [[Arch of Constantine|triumphal arch]], c.&nbsp;312&nbsp;AD, however, the sculptured panels were re-used from earlier monuments of [[Trajanic]] date.]]\n\nA distinction between frontier guard troops and more mobile reserve forces had emerged with the use of certain troops to permanently man frontiers such as Hadrian's Wall in ''Britannia'' in the 2nd century&nbsp;AD. The competing demands of manned frontiers and strategic reserve forces had led to the division of the military into four types of troops by the early 4th century:\n\n* The ''[[limitanei]]'' or ''riparienses'' patrolled the border and defended the border fortifications.

The scholae were his personal guard, and were mainly equipped as cavalry. Vogt suggests that the ''scholae'' formed two small central reserves (Latin: ''scholae'') held to the strategic rear even of the ''comitatenses'', one each in the presence of the emperors of West and East respectively.<ref name=\"VogtP177\">Vogt, ''The Decline of Rome'', p. 177</ref>\n\nThe permanent field armies of the ''palatini'' and ''comitatenses'' ultimately derived from the temporary field armies of the earlier ''sacer comitatus''.\n\nCreated and expanded from the core troops of the Emperor's personal bodyguards,{{clarify|date=September 2013}} the central field armies by 295&nbsp;AD seem to have been too large to be accounted for as simple bodyguard forces, but were still too small to be able to campaign independently of legionary or vexillation support.{{clarify|date=September 2013}}<ref>Campbell, ''The Army'', p. 121</ref>\n\nOf the four troop types, the ''limitanei'' (border guards) were once considered to have been of the lowest quality,<ref>Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565 AD''. p. 452<br>* Grant, ''A History of Rome'', p. 333<br>* Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 188</ref> consisting largely of peasant-soldiers that were both \"grossly inferior\" to the earlier legions and inferior also to their counterparts in the mobile field armies.<ref>Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', pp. 154, 173</ref> However, more recent work establishes that the ''limitanei'' were regular soldiers.<ref name=Treadgold161>Treadgold 1995, p. 161.</ref><ref name=Strobel268>Strobel 2011, p. 268.</ref><ref name=\"Southern & Dixon, 1996, p. 57\"/>\n\nWhile the ''limitanei'' were supposed to deal with policing actions and low-intensity incursions, the duty of responding to more serious incidents fell upon the provincial troops.{{contradict-inline|date=September 2013}} The countering of the very largest scale incursions on a strategic scale was the task of the ''comitatenses'' and ''palatini'' or mobile field troops, possibly accompanied by the emperor's ''scholae''.

Since the term legion continued to be used, it is unclear exactly when the structure and role of the legions changed. In the 3rd or 4th century, however, the legions' role as elite heavy infantry was substantially reduced<ref name=\"BV59\">Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565 AD''. p. 453<br>* Vogt, ''The Decline of Rome'', p. 59</ref> and may have evaporated entirely.<ref name=\"luttwakP175\">Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 175</ref> Instead, those \"legions\" that remained were no longer drawn exclusively (and perhaps hardly at all) from Roman citizens.<ref name=\"CaryP534\"/> Either Diocletian<ref>Brian Campbell, ''The Crisis of Empire'', p. 123</ref> or Constantine reorganised the legions into smaller infantry units<ref name=\"CaryP534\"/> who, according to some sources, were more lightly armoured than their forebears.<ref name=\"BV59\" /> Their lighter armament may have been either because they \"would not consent to wear the same weight of body armour as the legionaries of old\"<ref>Cary & Scullard, ''A History of Rome'', p. 535</ref> or, as in at least one documented instance, because they were prohibited from wearing heavy armour by their general in order to increase their mobility.<ref name=\"alfoldiP209\">Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 209</ref> 4th-century legions were at times only one sixth the size of early imperial legions, and they were armed with some combination of spears, bows, slings, darts and swords, reflecting a greater contemporary emphasis on ranged fighting.<ref>Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 209<br>* Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 175</ref> The ''auxilia'' and ''numeri'' had also largely disappeared.<ref name=\"alfoldiP213\">Alfoldi, ''The Crisis of the Empire'', p. 213</ref> Constantine further increased the proportion of German troops in the regular army;<ref name=\"grantP310\">Grant, ''A History of Rome'', p. 310</ref> their cultural impact was so great that even legionaries began wearing German dress.<ref name=\"VogtP59\"/> At the start of Diocletian's reign, the Roman army numbered about 390,000 men, but by the end of his reign he successfully increased the number to 581,000 men.<ref name=\"army\">Treadgold, ''A History of Byzantine State and Society'', 19</ref>\n\n===Adoption of barbarian allies (358\u2013395&nbsp;AD)===\n\nBy the late 4th century, the Empire had become chronically deficient in raising sufficient troops from amongst its own population.<ref name=\"grantP334\">Grant, ''The History of Rome'', p. 334</ref> As an alternative, taxation raised internally was increasingly used to subsidise growing numbers of barbarian recruits. The Romans had, for some time, recruited individual non-Roman soldiers into regular military units. In 358&nbsp;AD, this practice was accelerated by the wholescale adoption of the entire [[Salian Franks]] people into the Empire, providing a ready pool of such recruits. In return for being allowed to settle as ''[[foederatii]]'' in northern ''[[Gaul|Gallia]]'' on the near side of the [[Rhine]], the Franks were expected to defend the Empire's borders in their territory and provide troops to serve in Roman units.\n\nIn 376, a large band of [[Goths]] asked Emperor [[Valens]] for permission to settle on the southern bank of the [[Danube River]] on terms similar to the Franks. The Goths were also accepted into the empire as ''foederati''; however, they rebelled later that year and defeated the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]]. The heavy losses that the Roman military suffered during this defeat ironically forced the Roman Empire to rely still further on such ''foederati'' troops to supplement its forces.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Historiae'', book 31, chapters 3\u201316.</ref> In 382, the practice was radically extended when federated troops were signed up ''[[en masse]]'' as allied contingents of ''laeti'' and ''foederatii'' troops separate from existing Roman units.<ref name=\"grantP334\"/> Near-constant civil wars during the period 408 and 433 between various Roman usurpers, emperors and their supposed deputies such as [[Constantine III (Western Roman Emperor)|Constantine III]], [[Constantius III]], [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] and [[Bonifacius]] resulted in further losses, necessitating the handing over of more taxable land to foederati.\n\nThe size and composition of these allied forces remains in dispute. Santosuosso argues that ''foederati'' regiments consisted mostly of cavalry<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 189</ref> that were raised both as a temporary levy for a specific campaign need and, in some cases, as a permanent addition to the army. Hugh Elton believes that the importance of ''foederati'' has been overstated in traditional accounts by historians such as A.H.M. Jones. Elton argues that the majority of soldiers were probably non-Italian Roman citizens,'''{{r|group=Note|F}}'''<ref>Elton, ''Warfare in Roman Europe'', pp. 145\u2013152.</ref>  while Santosuosso believes that the majority of troops were almost certainly non-citizen ''barbari''.<ref>Santosuosso, ''Storming the Heavens'', p. 192</ref>\n\n==Collapse in the West and survival in the East (395\u2013476&nbsp;AD)==\n[[Image:Greatpalacemosaic.jpg|thumb|205px|right|Mosaic of what is presumed to be a Gothic war leader.

He served as principal of [[Alexis I. duPont High School]] (1894\u20131903) in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], superintendent of [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] Public Schools (1903\u20131913) in Delaware, superintendent of [[Dorchester County Public Schools]] (1913\u20131917) in Maryland, and [[Delaware Department of Education|Delaware State commissioner of Education]] (1917\u20131921).\n\nIn 1894, Spaid relocated to Delaware, where he was elected principal of Alexis I. duPont High School in Wilmington and served in this position until 1903. Spaid became superintendent of New Castle County Public Schools in 1903 and remained in this position until 1913. Throughout his tenure as superintendent, Spaid argued for compulsory education and the consolidation of New Castle County's rural public schools. In response to a shortage of teachers, Spaid instituted pay raises for some teachers in July 1906 so that they would return for the fall term. In May 1908, the Delaware State Board of Education appointed Spaid and the county superintendents to a committee charged with revising the state public school system's curriculum.\n\nSpaid received a Master of Arts degree in education from [[Columbia University]] in 1917. In November 1918, he issued a bulletin entitled, ''Our Children Must Be Educated'', in which he appealed to parents and school administrators to address rising teacher resignations, withdrawals of school children and other conditions that affected the state's public school system. He stressed that it was necessary to keep Delaware's children in school to avoid illiteracy. Under Spaid's initiative to bring efficiency to the state's public school system, the Delaware State Board of Education adopted a new school code in 1919. In May 1921, Spaid and the State Board of Education urged county superintendents and school principals to observe [[Memorial Day]] at their schools. Spaid left Delaware in 1921 and engaged in [[Chautauqua]]-related work before becoming the head of the Education Department at [[Salem University]] in [[Salem, West Virginia]], from 1926 to 1936.\n\nSpaid was a [[Natural history|naturalist]] by hobby and he photographed \"hundreds of objects in nature\", utilizing these photographs as illustrations in his nature study articles and lecture slides. Throughout his career as a school administrator, Spaid also served as an instructor, lecturer, and speaker for multiple courses, institutes, and organizations. Spaid was also an avid writer, and he published articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'' and ''[[Country Life in America]]''. Spaid had planned to author a book on his nature studies, for which he had written notes and collected specimens; however, his home and notebooks were destroyed in a fire in 1917. Spaid died at the home of his daughter in [[Winchester, Virginia]], in 1936. According to historians [[Hu Maxwell]] and [[Howard Llewellyn Swisher]], Spaid \"placed himself in the front rank of the educational works of Delaware, and received the commendation of the press and the educators for his advanced ideas.\"<ref name=\"Maxwell 1\">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=730.}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and education ==\nArthur Rusmiselle Miller Spaid was born on 27&nbsp;July 1866 in [[Capon Springs, West Virginia|Capon Springs]], West Virginia, to John W.

He served as principal of [[Alexis I. duPont High School]] (1894\u20131903) in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], superintendent of [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] Public Schools (1903\u20131913) in Delaware, superintendent of [[Dorchester County Public Schools]] (1913\u20131917) in Maryland, and [[Delaware Department of Education|Delaware State commissioner of Education]] (1917\u20131921).\n\nIn 1894, Spaid relocated to Delaware, where he was elected principal of Alexis I. duPont High School in Wilmington and served in this position until 1903. Spaid became superintendent of New Castle County Public Schools in 1903 and remained in this position until 1913. Throughout his tenure as superintendent, Spaid argued for compulsory education and the consolidation of New Castle County's rural public schools. In response to a shortage of teachers, Spaid instituted pay raises for some teachers in July 1906 so that they would return for the fall term. In May 1908, the Delaware State Board of Education appointed Spaid and the county superintendents to a committee charged with revising the state public school system's curriculum.\n\nSpaid received a Master of Arts degree in education from [[Columbia University]] in 1917. In November 1918, he issued a bulletin entitled, ''Our Children Must Be Educated'', in which he appealed to parents and school administrators to address rising teacher resignations, withdrawals of school children and other conditions that affected the state's public school system. He stressed that it was necessary to keep Delaware's children in school to avoid illiteracy. Under Spaid's initiative to bring efficiency to the state's public school system, the Delaware State Board of Education adopted a new school code in 1919. In May 1921, Spaid and the State Board of Education urged county superintendents and school principals to observe [[Memorial Day]] at their schools. Spaid left Delaware in 1921 and engaged in [[Chautauqua]]-related work before becoming the head of the Education Department at [[Salem University]] in [[Salem, West Virginia]], from 1926 to 1936.\n\nSpaid was a [[Natural history|naturalist]] by hobby and he photographed \"hundreds of objects in nature\", utilizing these photographs as illustrations in his nature study articles and lecture slides. Throughout his career as a school administrator, Spaid also served as an instructor, lecturer, and speaker for multiple courses, institutes, and organizations. Spaid was also an avid writer, and he published articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'' and ''[[Country Life in America]]''. Spaid had planned to author a book on his nature studies, for which he had written notes and collected specimens; however, his home and notebooks were destroyed in a fire in 1917. Spaid died at the home of his daughter in [[Winchester, Virginia]], in 1936. According to historians [[Hu Maxwell]] and [[Howard Llewellyn Swisher]], Spaid \"placed himself in the front rank of the educational works of Delaware, and received the commendation of the press and the educators for his advanced ideas.\"<ref name=\"Maxwell 1\">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=730.}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and education ==\nArthur Rusmiselle Miller Spaid was born on 27&nbsp;July 1866 in [[Capon Springs, West Virginia|Capon Springs]], West Virginia, to John W.

It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with ''[[Mammuthus subplanifrons]]'' in the early [[Pliocene]]. The woolly mammoth began to diverge from the [[steppe mammoth]] about 800,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the [[Asian elephant]]. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in [[Siberia]] and [[Alaska]], as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric [[cave painting]]s. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of [[legendary creature]]s. The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by [[Georges Cuvier]] in 1796.\n\nThe woolly mammoth was roughly the same size as modern [[African elephant]]s. Males reached shoulder heights between {{convert|2.7|and|3.4|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} and weighed up to {{convert|6|MT|ST}}. Females reached {{convert|2.6|-|2.9|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in shoulder heights and weighed up to {{convert|4|MT|ST}}. A newborn calf weighed about {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]]. It was covered in fur, with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat. The colour of the [[coat (animal)|coat]] varied from dark to light. The ears and tail were short to minimise [[frostbite]] and heat loss. It had long, curved [[tusk]]s and four [[Molar (tooth)|molars]], which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants, and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grasses and [[Cyperaceae|sedges]]. Individuals could probably reach the age of 60.

Female tusks were smaller and thinner, {{convert|1.5|-|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} and weighing {{convert|9|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The sheaths of the tusks were parallel and spaced closely. About a quarter of the length was inside the sockets. The tusks grew spirally in opposite directions from the base and continued in a curve until the tips pointed towards each other, sometimes crossing. In this way, most of the weight would have been close to the skull, and less [[torque]] would occur than with straight tusks. The tusks were usually asymmetrical and showed considerable variation, with some tusks curving down instead of outwards and some being shorter due to breakage. Calves developed small [[milk tusks]] a few centimetres long at six months old, which were replaced by permanent tusks a year later. Tusk growth continued throughout life, but became slower as the animal reached adulthood. The tusks grew by {{convert|2.5|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} each year. Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths with small or no tusks, but whether this reflected reality or was artistic license is unknown.

About {{convert|23|cm|in|abbr=on}} of the crown was within the jaw, and {{convert|2.5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} was above. The crown was continually pushed forwards and up as it wore down, comparable to a [[conveyor belt]]. The teeth had up to 26 separated ridges of [[Tooth enamel|enamel]], which were themselves covered in \"prisms\" that were directed towards the chewing surface. These were quite wear-resistant and kept together by [[cementum]] and [[dentine]]. A mammoth had six sets of molars throughout a lifetime, which were replaced five times, though a few specimens with a seventh set are known. The latter condition could extend the lifespan of the individual, unless the tooth consisted of only a few plates. The first molars were about the size of those of a human, {{convert|1.3|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the third were 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in) {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, and the sixth were about {{convert|30|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} long and weighed {{convert|1.8|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.

Sometimes, the replacement was disrupted, and the molars were pushed into abnormal positions, but some animals are known to have survived this. Teeth from Britain showed that 2% of specimens had [[periodontal disease]], with half of these containing [[caries]]. The teeth also sometimes had [[cancerous]] growths.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;108\u2013109</ref>\n\n==Palaeobiology==\n[[File:Ice age fauna of northern Spain - Mauricio Ant\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|[[Life restoration]] of fauna during the Pleistocene epoch in northern Spain, by [[Mauricio Ant\u00f3n]], 2004]]\nAdult woolly mammoths could effectively defend themselves from predators with their tusks, trunks and size, but juveniles and weakened adults were vulnerable to pack hunters such as [[wolves]], [[cave hyena]]s and large [[felidae|felines]]. The tusks may also have been used in intraspecies fighting, such as fights over [[Territory (animal)|territory]] or mates. Display of the large tusks of males could also have been used to attract females, and to intimidate rivals. Because of their curvature, the tusks were not suitable for stabbing, but may have been used for hitting, as indicated by injuries to some fossil shoulder blades. The very long hairs on the tail probably compensated for the shortness of the tail, enabling its use as a [[flyswatter]], similar to the tail on modern elephants. As in modern elephants, the sensitive and muscular trunk worked as a limb-like organ with many functions. It was used for manipulating objects, and in social interactions.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;95\u2013105</ref> The well-preserved foot of the adult male \"[[Yukagir mammoth]]\" shows that the soles of the feet contained many cracks that would have helped in gripping surfaces during locomotion. Like modern elephants, woolly mammoths walked on their toes and had large, fleshy pads behind the toes.<ref name=\"Lister 2007 82 87\"/>\n\nLike modern elephants, woolly mammoths were likely very social and lived in [[matriarchal]] (female-led) family groups. This is supported by fossil assemblages and cave paintings showing groups. So, most of their other social behaviours probably were similar to those of modern elephants. How many mammoths lived at one location at a time is unknown, as fossil deposits are often accumulations of individuals that died over long periods of time. The numbers likely varied by season and lifecycle events. Modern elephants can form large herds, sometimes consisting of multiple family groups, and these herds can include thousands of animals migrating together. Mammoths may have formed large herds more often, since animals that live in open areas are more likely to do this than those in forested areas.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;62\u201363</ref> Trackways made by a woolly mammoth herd 11,300\u201311,000 years ago have been found in the [[St. Mary Reservoir]] in Canada, showing that in this case almost equal numbers of adults, subadults, and juveniles were found. The adults had a stride of {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the juveniles ran to keep up.<ref name=\"Trackway\"/>\n\n===Adaptations to cold===\n[[File:Woolly Mammoth Overhair (x250).tif|thumb|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] image of a woolly mammoth overhair, 250X magnification]]\nThe woolly mammoth was probably the most specialised member of the family Elephantidae. They had lipopexia (fat storage) in their neck and [[withers]], for times when food availability was insufficient during winter, and their first three molars grew more quickly than in the calves of modern elephants. The expansion identified on the trunk of \"Yuka\" and other specimens was suggested to function as a \"fur mitten\"; the trunk tip was not covered in fur, but was used for foraging during winter, and could have been heated by curling it into the expansion. The expansion could be used to melt snow if a shortage of water to drink existed, as melting it directly inside the mouth could disturb the thermal balance of the animal.<ref name=\"Yuka trunk\"/> As in [[reindeer]] and [[musk oxen]], the [[haemoglobin]] of the woolly mammoth was adapted to the cold, with three mutations to improve oxygen delivery around the body and prevent freezing. This feature may have helped the mammoths to live at high latitudes.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = K. L. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = J. E. E. | last3 = Watson | first3 = L.

About 1.4 million DNA nucleotide differences were found between mammoths and elephants, which affect the sequence of more than 1,600 proteins. Differences were noted in genes for a number of aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival, including development of skin and hair, storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the heat-sensing genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin, which also affects hair growth. When inserted into human cells, the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild-type mice, and have wavier hair. Also, several alterations in circadian clock genes were found, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer.<ref name=\"Lynch2015\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2015.06.027| pmid = 26146078| title = Elephantid genomes reveal the molecular bases of Woolly Mammoth adaptations to the arctic| year = 2015| last1 = Lynch | first1 = V. | last2 = Bedoya-Reina | first2 = O.

The two-fingered tip of the trunk was probably adapted for picking up the short grasses of the last [[ice age]] ([[Quaternary glaciation]], 2.58 million years ago to present) by wrapping around them, whereas modern elephants curl their trunks around the longer grass of their tropical environments. The trunk could also be used for pulling off large grass tufts, delicately picking [[bud]]s and flowers, and tearing off leaves and branches where trees and shrubs were present.

The woolly mammoth chewed its food by using its powerful jaw muscles to move the mandible forwards and close the mouth, then backwards while opening; the sharp enamel ridges thereby cut across each other, grinding the food. The ridges were wear-resistant to enable the animal to chew large quantities of food, which often contained grit. Woolly mammoths may have used their tusks as shovels to clear snow from the ground and reach the vegetation buried below, and to break ice to drink. This is indicated on many preserved tusks by flat, polished sections up to {{convert|30|cm|in}} long on the part of the surface that would have reached the ground. The tusks were also used for obtaining food in other ways, such as digging up plants and stripping off bark.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;92\u201395</ref>\n\n===Life history===\n[[File:Mammoth tusk slice.jpg|thumb|left|Cross sectioned tusk with [[growth rings]], which can be used to determine the age of specimens]]\nThe lifespan of mammals is related to their size, and since modern elephants can reach the age of 60 years, the same is thought to be true for woolly mammoths, which were of a similar size. The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the [[growth rings]] of its tusks when viewed in cross section, but this does not account for its early years, as these are represented by the tips of the tusks, which are usually worn away. In the remaining part of the tusk, each major line represents a year, and weekly and daily ones can be found in between. Dark bands correspond to summers, so determining the season in which a mammoth died is possible. The growth of the tusks slowed when foraging became harder, for example during winter, during disease, or when a male was banished from the herd (male elephants live with their herds until about the age of 10). Mammoth tusks dating to the harshest period of the last glaciation 25\u201320,000 years ago show slower growth rates. Woolly mammoths continued growing past adulthood, like other elephants. Unfused limb bones show that males grew until they reached the age of 40, and females grew until they were 25. The frozen calf \"Dima\" was {{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall when it died at the age of 6\u201312 months. At this age, the second set of molars would be in the process of erupting, and the first set would be worn out at 18 months of age. The third set of molars lasted for 10 years, and this process was repeated until the final, sixth set emerged when the animal was 30 years old. When the last set of molars was worn out, the animal would be unable to chew and feed, and it would die of starvation. A study of North American mammoths found that they often died during winter or spring, the hardest times for northern animals to survive.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;83\u2013107.</ref><ref name=\"Herbert2010\">{{cite web | url = https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/mammoth-find-clues-past-present-and-future | title = A Mammoth Find: Clues to the Past, Present and Future | last = Herbert | first = B. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = D. | date = 5 May 2010 | website = Helix | publisher = [[Northwestern University]] | access-date = 1 August 2016 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160818074348/https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/mammoth-find-clues-past-present-and-future | archivedate = 18 August 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:Yukagir mammoth head.jpg|thumb|Head of the adult male \"Yukagir mammoth\"; the trunk is not preserved]]\nThe best-preserved head of a frozen adult specimen, that of a male nicknamed the \"Yukagir mammoth\", shows that woolly mammoths had temporal glands between the ear and the eye.<ref name=\"Yukagir\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Mol | first1 = D.| last2 = Shoshani| first2 = J. | last3 = Tikhonov | first3 = A. | last4 = van Geel | first4 = B. | last5 = Sano | first5 = S. | last6 = Lasarev | first6 = P.| last7 = Agenbroad| first7 = L. | title = The Yukagir mammoth: brief history, 14c dates, individual age, gender, size, physical and environmental conditions and storage | journal = Scientific Annals, School of Geology Aristotle University of Thessaloniki | volume = 98 | pages = 299\u2013314 | year = 2006}}</ref> This feature indicates that, like bull elephants, male woolly mammoths also entered \"[[musth]]\", a period of heightened aggressiveness.

Woolly mammoths were very important to ice-age humans, and human survival may have depended on the mammoth in some areas. Evidence for such coexistence was not recognised until the 19th century. [[William Buckland]] published his discovery of the [[Red Lady of Paviland]] skeleton in 1823, which was found in a cave alongside woolly mammoth bones, but he mistakenly denied that these were contemporaries. In 1864, [[\u00c9douard Lartet]] found an engraving of a woolly mammoth on a piece of mammoth ivory in the [[Abri de la Madeleine]] cave in [[Dordogne]], France. The engraving was the first widely accepted evidence for the coexistence of humans with prehistoric extinct animals and is the first contemporary depiction of such a creature known to modern science.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;116\u2013117</ref>\n[[File:KM - Altsteinzeit Mammut.jpg|thumb|Replica of a roughly 26,000-year-old ivory carving depicting a mammoth, Krahuletz-Museum]]\nThe woolly mammoth is the third-most depicted animal in ice-age art, after horses and bison, and these images were produced between 35,000 and 11,500 years ago.

How much prehistoric humans relied on woolly mammoth meat is unknown, since many other large herbivores were available. Many mammoth carcasses may have been scavenged by humans rather than hunted. Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths in structures interpreted as pitfall traps. Few specimens show direct, unambiguous evidence of having been hunted by humans.

Black points are records of mammoths, black lines are the northern limit of humans]]\nMost woolly mammoth populations disappeared during the late Pleistocene and early [[Holocene]], alongside most of the [[Pleistocene megafauna]] (including the Columbian mammoth). This extinction formed part of the [[Quaternary extinction event]], which began 40,000 years ago and peaked between 14,000 and 11,500 years ago. Scientists are divided over whether hunting or climate change, which led to the shrinkage of its habitat, was the main factor that contributed to the extinction of the woolly mammoth, or whether it was due to a combination of the two. Whatever the cause, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates. Different woolly mammoth populations did not die out simultaneously across their range, but gradually became extinct over time. Most populations disappeared between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. The last mainland population existed in the [[Chaunsky District|Kyttyk Peninsula]] of Siberia 9,650 years ago.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;146\u2013148</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Stuart | first1 = A.

Such fossils are usually fragmentary and contain no soft tissue. Accumulations of modern elephant remains have been termed \"[[elephants' graveyard]]s\", as these sites were erroneously thought to be where old elephants went to die. Similar accumulations of woolly mammoth bones have been found;  these are thought to be the result of individuals dying near or in the rivers over thousands of years, and their bones eventually being brought together by the streams. Some accumulations are also thought to be the remains of herds that died together at the same time, perhaps due to flooding. Natural traps, such as [[kettle holes]], [[sink holes]], and mud, have also trapped mammoths in separate events over time.<ref name=\"Lister 2007 45 75\"/>\n\nApart from frozen remains, the only soft tissue known is from a specimen that was preserved in a [[petroleum seep]] in [[Starunia]], Poland. Frozen remains of woolly mammoths have been found in the northern parts of [[Siberia]] and Alaska, with far fewer finds in the latter. Such remains are mostly found above the [[Arctic Circle]], in permafrost. Soft tissue apparently was less likely to be preserved between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago, perhaps because the climate was milder during that period. Most specimens have partially degraded before discovery, due to exposure or to being scavenged. This \"[[natural mummification]]\" required the animal to have been buried rapidly in liquid or semisolids such as silt, mud, and icy water, which then froze.<ref name=\"Lister, 2007. pp. 50\u201353\">Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;50\u201353</ref>\n\nThe presence of undigested food in the stomach and seed pods still in the mouth of many of the specimens suggests neither starvation nor exposure is likely.

[[Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Museum of Zoology]], [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]]]\nThe 1901 excavation of the \"Berezovka mammoth\" is the best documented of the early finds. It was discovered at the Siberian [[Berezovka River]] (after a dog had noticed its smell), and the Russian authorities financed its excavation. The entire expedition took 10 months, and the specimen had to be cut to pieces before it could be transported to St. Petersburg. Most of the skin on the head as well as the trunk had been scavenged by predators, and most of the internal organs had rotted away. It was identified as a 35- to 40-year-old male, which had died 35,000 years ago. The animal still had grass between its teeth and on the tongue, showing that it had died suddenly. One of its shoulder blades was broken, which may have happened when it fell into a crevasse. It may have died of [[asphyxiation]], as indicated by its erect penis.

Often, such finds were kept secret due to superstition. Several carcasses have been lost because they were not reported, and one was fed to dogs. In more recent years, scientific expeditions have been devoted to finding carcasses instead of relying solely on chance encounters. The most famous frozen specimen from Alaska is a calf nicknamed \"Effie\", which was found in 1948. It consists of the head, trunk, and a fore leg, and is about 25,000 years old.<ref name=\"Lister 2007 45 75\">Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;45\u201375</ref> \n[[File:Mamut enano-Beringia rusa-NOAA.jpg|thumb|\"Dima\", a frozen calf about seven months old, during excavation]]\nIn 1977, the well-preserved carcass of a seven- to eight-month-old woolly mammoth calf named \"Dima\" was discovered.

A less complete juvenile, nicknamed \"Mascha\", was found on the [[Yamal Peninsula]] in 1988. It was 3\u20134 months old, and a laceration on its right foot may have been the cause of death.

The first Siberian ivory to reach western Europe was brought to London in 1611. When Russia occupied Siberia, the ivory trade grew and it became a widely exported commodity, with huge amounts being excavated. From the 19th century and onwards, woolly mammoth ivory became a highly prized commodity, used as raw material for many products. Today, it is still in great demand as a replacement for the now-banned export of elephant ivory, and has been referred to as \"white gold\". Local dealers estimate that  10 million mammoths are still frozen in Siberia, and conservationists have suggested that this could help save the living species of elephants from extinction. Elephants are hunted by poachers for their ivory, but if this could instead be supplied by the already extinct mammoths, the demand could instead be met by these. Trade in elephant ivory has been forbidden in most places following the 1989 [[Lausanne]] Conference, but dealers have been known to label it as mammoth ivory to get it through customs. Mammoth ivory looks similar to elephant ivory, but the former is browner and the [[Schreger lines]] are coarser in texture.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;137\u2013139</ref> In the 21st century, [[global warming]] has made access to Siberian tusks easier, since the permafrost thaws more quickly, exposing the mammoths embedded within it.<ref name=\"Larmer2015\">{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/mammoth-tusks/larmer-text|title=Mammoth Tusk Hunters|website=nationalgeographic.com|date=April 2013|last=Larmer|first=B.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402004219/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/mammoth-tusks/larmer-text|archivedate=2 April 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:La fuite devant le mammouth.jpg|upright|thumb|''La fuite devant le mammouth'', [[Paul Jamin]], 1885]]\nStories abound about frozen woolly mammoth meat that was consumed once defrosted, especially that of the \"Berezovka mammoth\", but most of these are considered dubious.

It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with ''[[Mammuthus subplanifrons]]'' in the early [[Pliocene]]. The woolly mammoth began to diverge from the [[steppe mammoth]] about 800,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the [[Asian elephant]]. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in [[Siberia]] and [[Alaska]], as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric [[cave painting]]s. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of [[legendary creature]]s. The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by [[Georges Cuvier]] in 1796.\n\nThe woolly mammoth was roughly the same size as modern [[African elephant]]s. Males reached shoulder heights between {{convert|2.7|and|3.4|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} and weighed up to {{convert|6|MT|ST}}. Females reached {{convert|2.6|-|2.9|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in shoulder heights and weighed up to {{convert|4|MT|ST}}. A newborn calf weighed about {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]]. It was covered in fur, with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat. The colour of the [[coat (animal)|coat]] varied from dark to light. The ears and tail were short to minimise [[frostbite]] and heat loss. It had long, curved [[tusk]]s and four [[Molar (tooth)|molars]], which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants, and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grasses and [[Cyperaceae|sedges]]. Individuals could probably reach the age of 60. Its habitat was the [[mammoth steppe]], which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America.\n\nThe woolly mammoth coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings, and the species was also hunted for food. It disappeared from its mainland range at the end of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago.

Female tusks were smaller and thinner, {{convert|1.5|-|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} and weighing {{convert|9|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The sheaths of the tusks were parallel and spaced closely. About a quarter of the length was inside the sockets. The tusks grew spirally in opposite directions from the base and continued in a curve until the tips pointed towards each other, sometimes crossing. In this way, most of the weight would have been close to the skull, and less [[torque]] would occur than with straight tusks. The tusks were usually asymmetrical and showed considerable variation, with some tusks curving down instead of outwards and some being shorter due to breakage. Calves developed small [[milk tusks]] a few centimetres long at six months old, which were replaced by permanent tusks a year later. Tusk growth continued throughout life, but became slower as the animal reached adulthood. The tusks grew by {{convert|2.5|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} each year. Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths with small or no tusks, but whether this reflected reality or was artistic license is unknown.

About {{convert|23|cm|in|abbr=on}} of the crown was within the jaw, and {{convert|2.5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} was above. The crown was continually pushed forwards and up as it wore down, comparable to a [[conveyor belt]]. The teeth had up to 26 separated ridges of [[Tooth enamel|enamel]], which were themselves covered in \"prisms\" that were directed towards the chewing surface. These were quite wear-resistant and kept together by [[cementum]] and [[dentine]]. A mammoth had six sets of molars throughout a lifetime, which were replaced five times, though a few specimens with a seventh set are known. The latter condition could extend the lifespan of the individual, unless the tooth consisted of only a few plates. The first molars were about the size of those of a human, {{convert|1.3|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the third were 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in) {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, and the sixth were about {{convert|30|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} long and weighed {{convert|1.8|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.

Sometimes, the replacement was disrupted, and the molars were pushed into abnormal positions, but some animals are known to have survived this. Teeth from Britain showed that 2% of specimens had [[periodontal disease]], with half of these containing [[caries]]. The teeth also sometimes had [[cancerous]] growths.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;108\u2013109</ref>\n\n==Palaeobiology==\n[[File:Ice age fauna of northern Spain - Mauricio Ant\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|[[Life restoration]] of fauna during the Pleistocene epoch in northern Spain, by [[Mauricio Ant\u00f3n]], 2004]]\nAdult woolly mammoths could effectively defend themselves from predators with their tusks, trunks and size, but juveniles and weakened adults were vulnerable to pack hunters such as [[wolves]], [[cave hyena]]s and large [[felidae|felines]]. The tusks may also have been used in intraspecies fighting, such as fights over [[Territory (animal)|territory]] or mates. Display of the large tusks of males could also have been used to attract females, and to intimidate rivals. Because of their curvature, the tusks were not suitable for stabbing, but may have been used for hitting, as indicated by injuries to some fossil shoulder blades. The very long hairs on the tail probably compensated for the shortness of the tail, enabling its use as a [[flyswatter]], similar to the tail on modern elephants. As in modern elephants, the sensitive and muscular trunk worked as a limb-like organ with many functions. It was used for manipulating objects, and in social interactions.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;95\u2013105</ref> The well-preserved foot of the adult male \"[[Yukagir mammoth]]\" shows that the soles of the feet contained many cracks that would have helped in gripping surfaces during locomotion. Like modern elephants, woolly mammoths walked on their toes and had large, fleshy pads behind the toes.<ref name=\"Lister 2007 82 87\"/>\n\nLike modern elephants, woolly mammoths were likely very social and lived in [[matriarchal]] (female-led) family groups. This is supported by fossil assemblages and cave paintings showing groups. So, most of their other social behaviours probably were similar to those of modern elephants. How many mammoths lived at one location at a time is unknown, as fossil deposits are often accumulations of individuals that died over long periods of time. The numbers likely varied by season and lifecycle events. Modern elephants can form large herds, sometimes consisting of multiple family groups, and these herds can include thousands of animals migrating together. Mammoths may have formed large herds more often, since animals that live in open areas are more likely to do this than those in forested areas.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;62\u201363</ref> Trackways made by a woolly mammoth herd 11,300\u201311,000 years ago have been found in the [[St. Mary Reservoir]] in Canada, showing that in this case almost equal numbers of adults, subadults, and juveniles were found. The adults had a stride of {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the juveniles ran to keep up.<ref name=\"Trackway\"/>\n\n===Adaptations to cold===\n[[File:Woolly Mammoth Overhair (x250).tif|thumb|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] image of a woolly mammoth overhair, 250X magnification]]\nThe woolly mammoth was probably the most specialised member of the family Elephantidae. They had lipopexia (fat storage) in their neck and [[withers]], for times when food availability was insufficient during winter, and their first three molars grew more quickly than in the calves of modern elephants. The expansion identified on the trunk of \"Yuka\" and other specimens was suggested to function as a \"fur mitten\"; the trunk tip was not covered in fur, but was used for foraging during winter, and could have been heated by curling it into the expansion. The expansion could be used to melt snow if a shortage of water to drink existed, as melting it directly inside the mouth could disturb the thermal balance of the animal.<ref name=\"Yuka trunk\"/> As in [[reindeer]] and [[musk oxen]], the [[haemoglobin]] of the woolly mammoth was adapted to the cold, with three mutations to improve oxygen delivery around the body and prevent freezing. This feature may have helped the mammoths to live at high latitudes.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = K. L. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = J. E. E. | last3 = Watson | first3 = L.

About 1.4 million DNA nucleotide differences were found between mammoths and elephants, which affect the sequence of more than 1,600 proteins. Differences were noted in genes for a number of aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival, including development of skin and hair, storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the heat-sensing genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin, which also affects hair growth. When inserted into human cells, the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild-type mice, and have wavier hair. Also, several alterations in circadian clock genes were found, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer.<ref name=\"Lynch2015\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2015.06.027| pmid = 26146078| title = Elephantid genomes reveal the molecular bases of Woolly Mammoth adaptations to the arctic| year = 2015| last1 = Lynch | first1 = V. | last2 = Bedoya-Reina | first2 = O.

The two-fingered tip of the trunk was probably adapted for picking up the short grasses of the last [[ice age]] ([[Quaternary glaciation]], 2.58 million years ago to present) by wrapping around them, whereas modern elephants curl their trunks around the longer grass of their tropical environments. The trunk could also be used for pulling off large grass tufts, delicately picking [[bud]]s and flowers, and tearing off leaves and branches where trees and shrubs were present.

The woolly mammoth chewed its food by using its powerful jaw muscles to move the mandible forwards and close the mouth, then backwards while opening; the sharp enamel ridges thereby cut across each other, grinding the food. The ridges were wear-resistant to enable the animal to chew large quantities of food, which often contained grit. Woolly mammoths may have used their tusks as shovels to clear snow from the ground and reach the vegetation buried below, and to break ice to drink. This is indicated on many preserved tusks by flat, polished sections up to {{convert|30|cm|in}} long on the part of the surface that would have reached the ground. The tusks were also used for obtaining food in other ways, such as digging up plants and stripping off bark.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;92\u201395</ref>\n\n===Life history===\n[[File:Mammoth tusk slice.jpg|thumb|left|Cross sectioned tusk with [[growth rings]], which can be used to determine the age of specimens]]\nThe lifespan of mammals is related to their size, and since modern elephants can reach the age of 60 years, the same is thought to be true for woolly mammoths, which were of a similar size. The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the [[growth rings]] of its tusks when viewed in cross section, but this does not account for its early years, as these are represented by the tips of the tusks, which are usually worn away. In the remaining part of the tusk, each major line represents a year, and weekly and daily ones can be found in between. Dark bands correspond to summers, so determining the season in which a mammoth died is possible. The growth of the tusks slowed when foraging became harder, for example during winter, during disease, or when a male was banished from the herd (male elephants live with their herds until about the age of 10). Mammoth tusks dating to the harshest period of the last glaciation 25\u201320,000 years ago show slower growth rates. Woolly mammoths continued growing past adulthood, like other elephants. Unfused limb bones show that males grew until they reached the age of 40, and females grew until they were 25. The frozen calf \"Dima\" was {{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall when it died at the age of 6\u201312 months. At this age, the second set of molars would be in the process of erupting, and the first set would be worn out at 18 months of age. The third set of molars lasted for 10 years, and this process was repeated until the final, sixth set emerged when the animal was 30 years old. When the last set of molars was worn out, the animal would be unable to chew and feed, and it would die of starvation. A study of North American mammoths found that they often died during winter or spring, the hardest times for northern animals to survive.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;83\u2013107.</ref><ref name=\"Herbert2010\">{{cite web | url = https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/mammoth-find-clues-past-present-and-future | title = A Mammoth Find: Clues to the Past, Present and Future | last = Herbert | first = B. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = D. | date = 5 May 2010 | website = Helix | publisher = [[Northwestern University]] | access-date = 1 August 2016 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160818074348/https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/mammoth-find-clues-past-present-and-future | archivedate = 18 August 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:Yukagir mammoth head.jpg|thumb|Head of the adult male \"Yukagir mammoth\"; the trunk is not preserved]]\nThe best-preserved head of a frozen adult specimen, that of a male nicknamed the \"Yukagir mammoth\", shows that woolly mammoths had temporal glands between the ear and the eye.<ref name=\"Yukagir\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Mol | first1 = D.| last2 = Shoshani| first2 = J. | last3 = Tikhonov | first3 = A. | last4 = van Geel | first4 = B. | last5 = Sano | first5 = S. | last6 = Lasarev | first6 = P.| last7 = Agenbroad| first7 = L. | title = The Yukagir mammoth: brief history, 14c dates, individual age, gender, size, physical and environmental conditions and storage | journal = Scientific Annals, School of Geology Aristotle University of Thessaloniki | volume = 98 | pages = 299\u2013314 | year = 2006}}</ref> This feature indicates that, like bull elephants, male woolly mammoths also entered \"[[musth]]\", a period of heightened aggressiveness.

Woolly mammoths were very important to ice-age humans, and human survival may have depended on the mammoth in some areas. Evidence for such coexistence was not recognised until the 19th century. [[William Buckland]] published his discovery of the [[Red Lady of Paviland]] skeleton in 1823, which was found in a cave alongside woolly mammoth bones, but he mistakenly denied that these were contemporaries. In 1864, [[\u00c9douard Lartet]] found an engraving of a woolly mammoth on a piece of mammoth ivory in the [[Abri de la Madeleine]] cave in [[Dordogne]], France. The engraving was the first widely accepted evidence for the coexistence of humans with prehistoric extinct animals and is the first contemporary depiction of such a creature known to modern science.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;116\u2013117</ref>\n[[File:KM - Altsteinzeit Mammut.jpg|thumb|Replica of a roughly 26,000-year-old ivory carving depicting a mammoth, Krahuletz-Museum]]\nThe woolly mammoth is the third-most depicted animal in ice-age art, after horses and bison, and these images were produced between 35,000 and 11,500 years ago.

How much prehistoric humans relied on woolly mammoth meat is unknown, since many other large herbivores were available. Many mammoth carcasses may have been scavenged by humans rather than hunted. Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths in structures interpreted as pitfall traps. Few specimens show direct, unambiguous evidence of having been hunted by humans.

Black points are records of mammoths, black lines are the northern limit of humans]]\nMost woolly mammoth populations disappeared during the late Pleistocene and early [[Holocene]], alongside most of the [[Pleistocene megafauna]] (including the Columbian mammoth). This extinction formed part of the [[Quaternary extinction event]], which began 40,000 years ago and peaked between 14,000 and 11,500 years ago. Scientists are divided over whether hunting or climate change, which led to the shrinkage of its habitat, was the main factor that contributed to the extinction of the woolly mammoth, or whether it was due to a combination of the two. Whatever the cause, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates. Different woolly mammoth populations did not die out simultaneously across their range, but gradually became extinct over time. Most populations disappeared between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. The last mainland population existed in the [[Chaunsky District|Kyttyk Peninsula]] of Siberia 9,650 years ago.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;146\u2013148</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Stuart | first1 = A.

Such fossils are usually fragmentary and contain no soft tissue. Accumulations of modern elephant remains have been termed \"[[elephants' graveyard]]s\", as these sites were erroneously thought to be where old elephants went to die. Similar accumulations of woolly mammoth bones have been found;  these are thought to be the result of individuals dying near or in the rivers over thousands of years, and their bones eventually being brought together by the streams. Some accumulations are also thought to be the remains of herds that died together at the same time, perhaps due to flooding. Natural traps, such as [[kettle holes]], [[sink holes]], and mud, have also trapped mammoths in separate events over time.<ref name=\"Lister 2007 45 75\"/>\n\nApart from frozen remains, the only soft tissue known is from a specimen that was preserved in a [[petroleum seep]] in [[Starunia]], Poland. Frozen remains of woolly mammoths have been found in the northern parts of [[Siberia]] and Alaska, with far fewer finds in the latter. Such remains are mostly found above the [[Arctic Circle]], in permafrost. Soft tissue apparently was less likely to be preserved between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago, perhaps because the climate was milder during that period. Most specimens have partially degraded before discovery, due to exposure or to being scavenged. This \"[[natural mummification]]\" required the animal to have been buried rapidly in liquid or semisolids such as silt, mud, and icy water, which then froze.<ref name=\"Lister, 2007. pp. 50\u201353\">Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;50\u201353</ref>\n\nThe presence of undigested food in the stomach and seed pods still in the mouth of many of the specimens suggests neither starvation nor exposure is likely.

[[Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Museum of Zoology]], [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]]]\nThe 1901 excavation of the \"Berezovka mammoth\" is the best documented of the early finds. It was discovered at the Siberian [[Berezovka River]] (after a dog had noticed its smell), and the Russian authorities financed its excavation. The entire expedition took 10 months, and the specimen had to be cut to pieces before it could be transported to St. Petersburg. Most of the skin on the head as well as the trunk had been scavenged by predators, and most of the internal organs had rotted away. It was identified as a 35- to 40-year-old male, which had died 35,000 years ago. The animal still had grass between its teeth and on the tongue, showing that it had died suddenly. One of its shoulder blades was broken, which may have happened when it fell into a crevasse. It may have died of [[asphyxiation]], as indicated by its erect penis.

Often, such finds were kept secret due to superstition. Several carcasses have been lost because they were not reported, and one was fed to dogs. In more recent years, scientific expeditions have been devoted to finding carcasses instead of relying solely on chance encounters. The most famous frozen specimen from Alaska is a calf nicknamed \"Effie\", which was found in 1948. It consists of the head, trunk, and a fore leg, and is about 25,000 years old.<ref name=\"Lister 2007 45 75\">Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;45\u201375</ref> \n[[File:Mamut enano-Beringia rusa-NOAA.jpg|thumb|\"Dima\", a frozen calf about seven months old, during excavation]]\nIn 1977, the well-preserved carcass of a seven- to eight-month-old woolly mammoth calf named \"Dima\" was discovered.

A less complete juvenile, nicknamed \"Mascha\", was found on the [[Yamal Peninsula]] in 1988. It was 3\u20134 months old, and a laceration on its right foot may have been the cause of death.

The first Siberian ivory to reach western Europe was brought to London in 1611. When Russia occupied Siberia, the ivory trade grew and it became a widely exported commodity, with huge amounts being excavated. From the 19th century and onwards, woolly mammoth ivory became a highly prized commodity, used as raw material for many products. Today, it is still in great demand as a replacement for the now-banned export of elephant ivory, and has been referred to as \"white gold\". Local dealers estimate that  10 million mammoths are still frozen in Siberia, and conservationists have suggested that this could help save the living species of elephants from extinction. Elephants are hunted by poachers for their ivory, but if this could instead be supplied by the already extinct mammoths, the demand could instead be met by these. Trade in elephant ivory has been forbidden in most places following the 1989 [[Lausanne]] Conference, but dealers have been known to label it as mammoth ivory to get it through customs. Mammoth ivory looks similar to elephant ivory, but the former is browner and the [[Schreger lines]] are coarser in texture.<ref>Lister, 2007. pp.&nbsp;137\u2013139</ref> In the 21st century, [[global warming]] has made access to Siberian tusks easier, since the permafrost thaws more quickly, exposing the mammoths embedded within it.<ref name=\"Larmer2015\">{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/mammoth-tusks/larmer-text|title=Mammoth Tusk Hunters|website=nationalgeographic.com|date=April 2013|last=Larmer|first=B.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402004219/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/mammoth-tusks/larmer-text|archivedate=2 April 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:La fuite devant le mammouth.jpg|upright|thumb|''La fuite devant le mammouth'', [[Paul Jamin]], 1885]]\nStories abound about frozen woolly mammoth meat that was consumed once defrosted, especially that of the \"Berezovka mammoth\", but most of these are considered dubious. The carcasses were in most cases decayed, and the stench so unbearable that only wild scavengers and the dogs accompanying the finders showed any interest in the flesh. Such meat apparently was once recommended against illness in China, and Siberian natives have occasionally cooked the meat of frozen carcasses they discovered.<ref>Lister, 2007. p. 54</ref> According to one of the more famous stories, members of [[The Explorers Club]] dined on meat of a frozen mammoth from Alaska in 1951.

It was rebuilt after the original, dating from the Seleucid Empire, was devastated along with the rest of Apamea in the [[115 Antioch earthquake|115 AD earthquake]]. Reconstruction started immediately and over the course of the second century the city was completely rebuilt, starting with the Great Colonnade.<ref>Balty, 1988, p. 91.</ref> The colonnade was aligned along the north-south axis, making up the city's \"[[cardo maximus]]\". Starting at the city's north gate, the colonnade ran in an uninterrupted straight line to the south gate. The northern third of the colonnade's stretch is marked by a monumental votive column that stood opposite the baths.<ref name=foss207>Foss, 1997, p. 207.</ref> The colonnade passed through the centre of the city and several important buildings were clustered around it, including the baths, the [[agora]], the Temple of [[Tyche]], the [[nymphaeum]], the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]], the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] church and the basilica.<ref name=foss209>Foss, 1997, p. 209.</ref> On either side of the street a {{convert|6.15|m}} wide colonnade ran its full length. The columns were {{convert|9|m}} high and {{convert|0.9|m}} in diameter. They stood on square bases of 1.24 m on a side and 0.47 m high. The columns display two main designs: plain and distinctive [[Fluting (architecture)|spiral-flutes]].

The street was narrowed to 12 m by adding a walkway on either side. Several stretches of the street had their Roman pavement replaced with a new pavement made of squared blocks of limestone. The new pavement also covered a completely overhauled drainage system.

However, the theatre and its \"qanat\" continued to play an important role as a water resource during the Byzantine and Islamic periods.<ref name=\"Finlayson310\">Finlayson, 2012, p. 310.</ref> The theatre was built into a steep hill overlooking the [[Orontes River]] valley.<ref name=\"Finlayson292\">Finlayson, 2012, p. 292.</ref>\n\nThe theatre, along with the one at [[Ephesus]], is one of the largest surviving theatres of the [[Roman Empire]] with an estimated seating capacity in excess of 20,000.

It was rebuilt after the original, dating from the Seleucid Empire, was devastated along with the rest of Apamea in the [[115 Antioch earthquake|115 AD earthquake]]. Reconstruction started immediately and over the course of the second century the city was completely rebuilt, starting with the Great Colonnade.<ref>Balty, 1988, p. 91.</ref> The colonnade was aligned along the north-south axis, making up the city's \"[[cardo maximus]]\". Starting at the city's north gate, the colonnade ran in an uninterrupted straight line to the south gate. The northern third of the colonnade's stretch is marked by a monumental votive column that stood opposite the baths.<ref name=foss207>Foss, 1997, p. 207.</ref> The colonnade passed through the centre of the city and several important buildings were clustered around it, including the baths, the [[agora]], the Temple of [[Tyche]], the [[nymphaeum]], the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]], the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] church and the basilica.<ref name=foss209>Foss, 1997, p. 209.</ref> On either side of the street a {{convert|6.15|m}} wide colonnade ran its full length. The columns were {{convert|9|m}} high and {{convert|0.9|m}} in diameter. They stood on square bases of 1.24 m on a side and 0.47 m high. The columns display two main designs: plain and distinctive [[Fluting (architecture)|spiral-flutes]].

The street was narrowed to 12 m by adding a walkway on either side. Several stretches of the street had their Roman pavement replaced with a new pavement made of squared blocks of limestone. The new pavement also covered a completely overhauled drainage system.

However, the theatre and its \"qanat\" continued to play an important role as a water resource during the Byzantine and Islamic periods.<ref name=\"Finlayson310\">Finlayson, 2012, p. 310.</ref> The theatre was built into a steep hill overlooking the [[Orontes River]] valley.<ref name=\"Finlayson292\">Finlayson, 2012, p. 292.</ref>\n\nThe theatre, along with the one at [[Ephesus]], is one of the largest surviving theatres of the [[Roman Empire]] with an estimated seating capacity in excess of 20,000.
