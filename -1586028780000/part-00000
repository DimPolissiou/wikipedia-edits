In the 5th century BC the first town, or [[oppidum]], was founded at the top of the hill today called Castello (Castle), which is now inside the medieval old town. The ancient [[Ligures|Ligurian]] city was known as Stalia (\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u00ec\u03b1), referred to in this way by [[Artemidorus Ephesius]] and [[Pomponius Mela]]; this toponym is possibly preserved in the name of Staglieno, some {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} from the coast. Ligurian Stalia was overshadowed by the powerful [[Marseille]] and [[Vada Sabatia]], near modern [[Savona]]. Stalia had an alliance with [[Roman Republic|Rome]] through a ''foedus aequum'' (equal pact) in the course of the [[Second Punic War]] (218-201&nbsp;BC). The [[Carthaginians]] accordingly destroyed it in 209&nbsp;BC. The town was rebuilt and, after the [[Carthaginian Wars]] ended in 146&nbsp;BC, it received municipal rights. The original ''castrum'' expanded after that towards the current areas of Santa Maria di Castello and the San Lorenzo promontory. Trades included skins, wood, and honey. Goods were shipped to the mainland, up to major cities like [[Tortona]] and [[Piacenza]]. An amphitheater was also found there among the archeological remains from the Roman period.\n\n[[File:TavolaPolcevera.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Polcevera]] bronze tablet, evidence of Genoa's Roman and pre-Roman past]]\n\nThe city's modern name may derive from the [[Latin]] word meaning \"knee\" (''genu''; plural, ''genua'') but there are other theories. It could derive from the god [[Janus]], because Genoa, like him, has two faces: a face that looks at the sea and another turned to the mountains. Or it could come from the Latin word ''ianua'', also related to the name of the God Janus, and meaning \"door\" or \"passage.\" Besides that, it may refer to its geographical position at the centre of the Ligurian coastal arch, thus akin to the name of [[Geneva]].<ref>Giulia Petracco Sicardi, \"Genova\", in ''Dizionario di toponomastica'', Torino, 1990, p. 355. In [[Genoa Cathedral|Cathedral]] there is an inscription that says ''Janus, primus Rex Italiae de progenie gigantum, qui fundavit Genuam temporae Abrahae'', in English, \"Janus, the first King of Italy, progeny of the giants, who founded Genoa in the days of Abraham.\"\n \nAnother theory traces the name to the Etruscan word ''Kainua'' which means \"New City\". Piera Melli (''Genova Preromana'', 2007), based on an inscription on a pottery sherd reading ''Kainua'', suggests that the Latin name may be a corruption of an older Etruscan one with an original meaning of \"new town\".</ref> The Latin name, ''oppidum Genua'', is recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Nat. Hist.]]'' 3.48) as part of the [[Augustus|Augustean]] ''[[Regio IX Liguria]]''.\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the [[Ostrogoths]] occupied Genoa. After the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] made it the seat of their [[vicar]]. When the [[Lombards]] invaded Italy in 568, Bishop Honoratus of [[Bishopric of Milan|Milan]] fled and held his seat in Genoa.<ref>Paul the Deacon, Historia Langobardorum, II.25</ref> Pope [[Gregory the Great]] was closely connected to these bishops in exile, for example involving himself in the election of Deusdedit.<ref>Gregory I, Registrum Epistolarum, MGH Ep. 2, XI.14, p. 274</ref> The Lombards, under King [[Rothari]], finally captured Genoa and other Ligurian cities in about 643.<ref>Paul the Deacon, Historia Langobardorum, IV.45</ref> In 725 the mortal remains of [[Augustine of Hippo]] arrived in Genoa. In 773 the Lombard Kingdom was annexed by the [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish Empire]]; the first Carolingian count of Genoa was Ademarus, who was given the title ''praefectus civitatis Genuensis''. Ademarus died in [[Corsica]] while fighting against the Saracens. In this period the Roman walls, destroyed by the Lombards, were rebuilt and extended.\n\nFor the following several centuries, Genoa was little more than a small centre, slowly building its merchant fleet, which was to become the leading commercial carrier of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The town was [[Fatimid sack of Genoa|thoroughly sacked and burned]] in 934\u201335 by a [[Fatimid fleet]] under [[Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Tamimi]] and possibly even abandoned for a few years.<ref>Steven A. Epstein, ''Genoa and the Genoese, 958-1528. (The University of North Carolina Press, 1996), p. 14''</ref> In the 10th century the city, now part of the ''[[March of Genoa|Marca Januensis]]'' was under the [[Obertenghi]] family, whose first member was [[Oberto I|Obertus I]]. Genoa became one of the first cities in Italy to have some citizenship rights granted by local feudatories.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Middle ages and Renaissance==\n{{Main article|Republic of Genoa}}\n[[File:Ridolfo Ghirlandaio Columbus.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Christopher Columbus]] by [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio]]]]\n\nBefore 1100, Genoa emerged as an independent [[city-state]], one of a number of [[Italian city-states]] established during this period. Nominally, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] was sovereign and the [[Bishop of Genoa]] was head of state; however, actual power was wielded by a number of [[consul]]s annually elected by popular assembly. Genoa was one of the states known as ''[[Maritime republics|Repubbliche Marinare]]'' along with [[Venice]], [[Pisa]], and [[Amalfi]]. Trade, shipbuilding, and banking helped support one of the largest and most powerful navies in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. There is an old saying that says: ''Genuensis ergo mercator'', or \"A Genoese therefore a merchant\" but the Genoese were skilled sailors and ferocious warriors in addition (see also the [[Genoese crossbowmen]]). \n\nIn 1098, it is said the ashes of [[John the Baptist]], now the patron saint of the city, arrived in Genoa. The [[Adorno (family)|Adorno]], Campofregoso, and other smaller merchant families all fought for power in this republic, as the power of the consuls allowed each family faction to gain wealth and power in the city. The [[Republic of Genoa]] extended over modern [[Liguria]], [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], [[Sardinia]] (see also [[Pisan-Genoese expeditions to Sardinia]]), [[Corsica]], and [[County of Nice|Nice]], and had practically complete control of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. Through Genoese participation in the [[Crusades]], colonies were established in the [[Middle East]], the [[Aegean Sea]], [[Sicily]], and [[Northern Africa]]. The ''cronista'', or chronicler, of the Genoese vicissitudes was [[Caffaro di Rustico da Caschifellone]] and the hero and military leader was [[Guglielmo Embriaco]] called ''Testadimaglio'' meaning \"mallet head\" (see also [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)]]). Genoese Crusaders brought home a green glass goblet from the [[Levant]] (see also [[Holy Chalice]]), which the Genoese have long regarded as the [[Holy Grail]]. In his ''[[Golden Legend]]'', the Archbishop of Genoa, [[Jacobus de Voragine]] relates the history of the Holy Grail. \nNot all of Genoa's merchandise was so innocuous, however, as medieval Genoa became a major player in the slave trade.<ref>Steven A. Epstein, ''Speaking of Slavery: Color, Ethnicity and Human Bondage in Italy (Conjunctions of Religion and Power in the Medieval Past''</ref>\n\nThe Genoese have a claim to the creation of the rough denim cloth then called \"Blue Jean\", from which derives the modern name of [[jeans]], used by sailors for work and to cover and protect their goods on the docks from the weather. During the [[Republic of Genoa]], Genoese merchants and sailors exported this cloth throughout Europe. The production of [[Genoese lace]] was also notable.\n\n[[File:CroppedLanterna.JPG|thumb|left|The iconic ''[[Torre della Lanterna|Lanterna]]'', renaissance lighthouse of Genoa was built in 1543.]]\n\nThe collapse of the [[Crusader States]] was offset by Genoa's alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. As Venice's relations with the Byzantines were temporarily disrupted by the [[Fourth Crusade]] and its aftermath, Genoa was able to improve its position, taking advantage of the opportunity to expand into the [[Black Sea]] and [[Crimea]]. Internal feuds between the powerful families, the [[House of Grimaldi|Grimaldi]] and [[Fieschi]], the [[Doria (family)|Doria]], [[Spinola Family|Spinola]] and others, caused much disruption, but in general the republic was run much as a business affair.\n\nIn 1218\u20131220 Genoa was served by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] ''[[podest\u00e0]]'' [[Rambertino Buvalelli]], who probably introduced [[Occitan literature]], which was soon to boast such [[troubadour]]s as [[Jacme Grils]], [[Lanfranc Cigala]] and [[Bonifaci Calvo]], to the city. During this time, 1218\u20131219, a Genoese fleet under [[Simone Doria (admiral)|Simone Doria]] with the famous Genoese pirate [[Alamanno da Costa]] participated in the [[Siege of Damietta (1218-1219)|Siege of Damietta]]; about this period we must also remember the Genoese [[privateer]] and [[pirate]], [[Henry, Count of Malta]]. The alliance between Byzantines and Genoese suffered after the [[Battle of Settepozzi]], admirably described in the [[Annales ianuenses]]. \n\nGenoa's political zenith came with its victory over the [[Republic of Pisa]] at the naval [[Battle of Meloria (1284)|Battle of Meloria]] in 1284, and with a temporary victory over its rival, Venice, at the naval [[Battle of Curzola]] in 1298 during the [[Venetian-Genoese Wars]]. The Genoese navy was on a par with the Venetian navy and both cities had the power to rule the sea. Notable conflicts between Byzantines and Genoese were the [[Genoese occupation of Rhodes]] and the [[Byzantine-Genoese War (1348-49)|Byzantine-Genoese War]].\n\nHowever, this period of prosperity did not last. The [[Black Death]] is said to have been imported into Europe in 1347 from the Genoese trading post at [[Feodosia|Caffa]] in Crimea on the Black Sea. Following the economic and population collapse that resulted, Genoa adopted the [[Doge|Venetian model of government]] and was presided over by the [[Doge of Genoa]]. The wars with Venice continued, and the [[War of Chioggia]] (1378\u20131381) \u2013 during which Genoa almost managed to decisively subdue Venice \u2013 ended with Venice's recovery of dominance in the Adriatic. In 1390, Genoa initiated the [[Barbary Crusade]], with help from the French, and laid siege to [[Mahdia]], the Fatimid capital of Ifriqiya.\n\nThough not well-studied, Genoa in the 15th century seems to have been tumultuous. The city had a strong tradition of trading goods from the Levant and its financial expertise was recognised all over Europe. After a period of French domination from 1394 to 1409, Genoa came under the rule of the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] of [[Milan]] (see also [[Battle of Ponza (1435)|Battle of Ponza]]). Genoa lost [[Sardinia]] to [[Aragon]], [[Corsica]] to internal revolt, and its [[Middle East]]ern, [[Eastern Europe]]an, and [[Asia Minor]] colonies to the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nIn the 15th century two of the earliest banks in the world were founded in Genoa: the [[Bank of Saint George]], founded in 1407, which was the oldest chartered bank in the world at its closure in 1805 and the [[Banca Carige]], founded in 1483 as a [[mount of piety]], which still exists.\n\nGenoa was able to stabilise its position as it moved into the 16th century, particularly as a result of the efforts of Doge [[Andrea Doria]], who granted a new constitution in 1528 that made Genoa a satellite of the Spanish Empire ([[Siege of Coron]] 1532/34, [[Battle of Preveza]] 1538, [[Battle of Girolata]] 1540, [[Battle of Lepanto]] 1571, [[Relief of Genoa]] 1625). Some Genoese enjoyed remarkable careers in the service of the Spanish crown: notably the maritime explorers [[Juan Bautista Pastene]] and [[Leon Pancaldo]], the general [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases|Ambrogio Spinola]], the naval captain [[Cruz Family|Giovanni della Croce Bernardotte]] and Jorge Burgues. In the period of economic recovery which followed, many aristocratic Genoese families, such as the Balbi, Doria, Grimaldi, Pallavicini and Serra, amassed tremendous fortunes. According to Felipe Fernandez-Armesto and others, the practices Genoa developed in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] (such as chattel slavery) were crucial in the exploration and exploitation of the New World.<ref>''Before Columbus: Exploration and Colonization from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, 1229\u20131492''</ref> \n\nThe Genoese [[Pietro Vesconte]], [[Giovanni da Carignano]] and [[Battista Beccario]] (see [[Genoese map]] before the discovery of the Americas) were pioneers in cartography. [[Christopher Columbus]] himself was a native of Genoa and donated one-tenth of his income from the discovery of the [[Americas]] for [[Spain]] to the [[Bank of Saint George]] in Genoa for the relief of general taxation on food. Columbus was the culmination of a long tradition of Genoese navigators and explorers such as [[Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi]], [[Lancelotto Malocello]], [[Luca Tarigo]], [[Antonio de Noli]], [[Antonio Malfante]] and [[Antoniotto Usodimare]]. (It has been suggested that Antoniotto Usodimare and Antonio di Noli may be different names for the same person.) The famous Genoese navigator [[John Cabot]], a contemporary of Columbus, discovered northern parts of North America when sailing under the commission of [[Henry VII of England]].\n\nDuring its rise and its apogee, Genoa founded [[Genoese colonies|colonies]] in many parts of the world from Crimea to North Africa, from Spain to the Americas, leaving valuable architectural works in many locations, such as the forts of [[Caffa]], [[Balaklava]], [[Sudak]] and [[Tabarka]], the [[Galata Tower]] in [[Istanbul]], the [[Genoese Lighthouse|Lighthouse]] in Constan\u021ba, the [[Genoese towers in Corsica|Towers]] in Corsica and Sardinia. The Genoese established commercial bases and colonies around the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, called [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|Gazaria]]. They established flourishing communities in Constantinople, C\u00e1diz, Lisbon and Gibraltar (see also [[History of the Genoese in Gibraltar]] and [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantines]]); these communities were organised and governed by [[Maona]] (see also [[Maona di Chio e di Focea|Chio's Maona and Focea]]). The story of [[Cigalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha]] or Scipione Cicala, member of the aristocratic Genoese family of Cicala, is fascinating: it is said he was caught by the Ottomans in the [[Battle of Djerba]] and then he became Kapudan Pasha or Grand Admiral of the Ottoman fleet, (this adventure story is sung by [[Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9]] in \"Sin\u00e0n Capud\u00e0n Pasci\u00e0\").\n\n[[File:Braun Genova UBHD.jpg|thumb|300px|View of Genoa in 1572]]\n\nAt the time of Genoa's zenith in the 16th century, the city attracted many artists including [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Van Dyck]]. The famed architect [[Galeazzo Alessi]] (1512\u20131572) designed many of the city's splendid [[palazzo|palazzi]], and [[Bartolomeo Bianco]] (1590\u20131657) designed the centrepieces of the [[University of Genoa]]. A number of [[Genoese Baroque and Rococo artists]] settled elsewhere and a number of local artists became prominent. In the late sixteenth century, [[Luca Cambiaso]], known as the founder of the Genoese School of painting, went on to earn the largest payment then recorded (2,000 ducats) for work for Philip II of Spain in the Escorial palace in Madrid.\n\nIn the 17th century, however, Genoa entered a period of crisis. In May 1625, a French-Savoian army invaded the republic but was [[Relief of Genoa|successfully driven out]] by the combined Spanish and Genoese armies. In 1656\u201357, a new outburst of [[Naples Plague|plague]] killed as many as half of the population.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297474/Italy/27687/Early-modern-Italy-16th-to-18th-centuries Early modern Italy (16th to 18th centuries) \u00bb The 17th century crisis] ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.''</ref> In May 1684, as a punishment for Genoese support for Spain, the city was [[Bombardment of Genoa|subjected to a French naval bombardment]] with some 13,000 cannonballs aimed at the city.<ref>[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/17cen/genoa1684.html ''Genoa 1684''], World History at KMLA.</ref> Genoa was eventually occupied by [[Austria]] in 1746 during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. This episode in the city's history is mainly remembered for the Genoese revolt, precipitated by a legendary boy named Giovan Battista Perasso and nicknamed [[Balilla]] who threw a stone at an Austrian official and became a national hero to later generations of Genoese, and Italians in general (''see also'' [[Siege of Genoa (1746)]], [[Siege of Genoa (1747)]], and [[Siege of Genoa (1800)]]). Unable to retain its rule in [[Corsica]], where the rebel [[Corsican Republic]] was proclaimed in 1755, Genoa was forced by the well-supported rebellion to sell its claim to Corsica to the French, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles (1768)|Treaty of Versailles]] of 1768.\n\n==Modern history==\nWith the shift in world economy and trade routes to the New World and away from the Mediterranean, Genoa's political and economic power began a steady decline. Its military power collapsed during the [[Raid on Genoa]] in 1793 and the [[Battle of Genoa (1795)|Battle of Genoa]] in 1795 where Genoa fought the French fleet and the English. In 1797, under pressure from [[Napoleon]], the [[Republic of Genoa]] became a French protectorate called the [[Ligurian Republic]], which was annexed by France in 1805. This fact is mentioned in the first sentence of [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'':\n{{bquote|Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes.(...) And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at Milan, the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions [to be annexed to France] before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations?\" (spoken by a thoroughly anti-Bonapartist Russian aristocrat, soon after the news reached [[Saint Petersburg]]).}}\n\nAlthough the Genoese revolted against France in 1814 and liberated the city on their own, delegates at the [[Congress of Vienna]] sanctioned its incorporation into the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], thus ending the three century old struggle by the [[House of Savoy]] to acquire the city.\n\n[[File:Partenza da Quarto.jpg|thumb|Garibaldi leading the [[Expedition of the Thousand]]]]\n\nThe city soon gained a reputation as a hotbed of anti-Savoy republican agitation. Genoa was the centre of an important reform movement that put constant pressure on Piedmont to grant the freedom of the press and more liberal laws. The citizens of the republic would not accept being subjects of an absolute monarchy, wanting to be Italian rather than Piedmontese, though relations with Piedmont improved with the war against Austria. However, after the defeat in the [[First Italian War of Independence|First War of Independence]] and the armistice of Salasco, the Genoese, fearing the loss of freedom and independence as a consequence of a peace imposed by Austria, rose up and hunted the Piedmontese garrison. After the [[Revolt of Genoa|uprising of Genoa]], the troops of the general [[Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora]] moved against the city, besieged, bombed and sacked it. With the rise of the [[Risorgimento]], reunification of Italy, movement, the Genoese turned their struggles from [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]'s vision of a local republic into a struggle for a unified Italy under a liberalised Savoy monarchy. In 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] set out from Genoa with over a [[Expedition of the Thousand|thousand]] volunteers to begin the conquest of [[Southern Italy]] among them was [[Nino Bixio]]. Today a monument is set on the rock at the point where the patriot embarked, in [[Quarto dei Mille]].\n\n[[File:Genova-1810ca-acquatinta-Garneray-part-mura.jpg|thumb|left|Genoa in 1810]]\n\nIn the 19th and the early 20th centuries, Genoa consolidated its role as a major seaport and an important steel and shipbuilding centre. In Genoa in 1853, [[:it:Giovanni Ansaldo|Giovanni Ansaldo]] founded [[Gio. Ansaldo & C.]] whose shipyards would build some of the most beautiful ships in the world, such as [[ARA Garibaldi]], [[SS Roma (1926)|SS Roma]], [[MS Augustus]], [[SS Rex]], [[SS Andrea Doria]], [[SS Cristoforo Colombo]], [[MS Gripsholm (1957)|MS Gripsholm]], [[SS Leonardo da Vinci]], [[SS Michelangelo]], and [[SS SeaBreeze]]. In 1854, the ferry company [[Costa Crociere]] was founded in Genoa and then the Lloyd Italiano maritime insurance company. In 1861 the [[Registro Italiano Navale]] Italian register of shipping was created, and in 1879 the [[Yacht Club Italiano]]. The owner [[:it:Raffaele Rubarrino|Raffaele Rubattino]] in 1881 was among the founders of the ferry company [[Navigazione Generale Italiana]] which then become the [[Italian Line]]. \n\nIn 1884 [[:it:Rinaldo Piaggio|Rinaldo Piaggio]] founded [[Piaggio|Piaggio & C.]] that produced locomotives and railway carriages and in 1923 began aircraft production. The company as [[Piaggio Aerospace]] at present is owned by [[Mubadala Development Company]] and is based in [[Villanova d'Albenga]]. (After World War II, [[Enrico Piaggio]] son of Rinaldo Piaggio, with the engineer [[Corradino D'Ascanio]] conceived and realised one of the most common means of transport, the [[Vespa]]). In 1870 was founded Banca di Genova which in 1895 changed its name to [[Credito Italiano]] and in 1998 became [[Unicredit]]. Also in Genoa in 1898 the insurance company called [[Alleanza Assicurazioni]] was founded. In 1874 the city was completely connected by railway lines to France and the rest of Italy: [[Turin-Genoa railway|Genoa-Turin]], [[Genoa-Ventimiglia railway|Genoa-Ventimiglia]], [[Pisa-La Spezia-Genoa railway|Genoa-Pisa]]. \n\nIn Genoa the following shipyards were established: Cantiere Navale di Sestri Ponente, [[Cantiere della Foce]], [[Cantiere navale di Riva Trigoso]], Cantieri navali di Voltri but also the sugar factory Eridania, the food brands Saiwa, Elah and Icat Food. These technological and industrial developments would have worldwide exposure in 1892 when the city hosted the international exhibition \"Esposizione Italo-Americana\" and again in 1914 with the [[International exhibition of marine and maritime hygiene|Esposizione Internazionale di Marina e di igiene marinara]] (see the [[List of world's fairs]]). The strong industrialisation attracted large masses of workers which is why in 1892 the [[Italian Socialist Party]] was founded here by [[Filippo Turati]], [[Andrea Costa]], and [[Anna Kuliscioff]]. In 1886 was founded the newspaper [[Il Secolo XIX]] and in 1903 the socialist newspaper \"Il Lavoro\". [[Palmiro Togliatti]], one of the most influential Italian politicians of the 20th century, was born in Genoa in 1893.\n\nIn this period many Genoese emigrated to the [[Americas]] (see also [[Italian diaspora]]). Among the most interesting experiences of this exodus was the creation of the [[Buenos Aires]] district called [[La Boca]], now famous for its colorful houses in the Ligurian style, in addition on 3 April 1905 a group of Genoese boys founded the [[Boca Juniors]] football club in Buenos Aires. This is why the fans of Boca Juniors are called \"Los Xeneizes\", which means the Genoese. In addition, [[Amadeo Giannini]], the son of Genoese immigrants in North America, founded the [[Bank of America]]. (See also \"[[Italian Peruvians]]\", \"[[Italian Chileans]]\", \"[[Italian Uruguayans]]\").\n\nDuring [[World War I]] the Genoese shipyards were very active, importing vast quantities of materials necessary for the war effort, and between thirty thousand and eighty thousand Genoese left for the battlefront. About this period we have to remember the admiral [[Raffaele Rossetti]], famous for the sinking of the battleship [[SMS Viribus Unitis]]. Important urban and architectural works were constructed under [[Fascism]] including: [[:it:Piazza Dante (Genova)|Piazza Dante]] which includes the [[Terrazza Martini Tower|Piacentini's Tower]], [[:it:Piazza della Vittoria (Genova)|Piazza della Vittoria]] with its[[Arco della Vittoria]], and the Bisagno stream water tunnel. In 1935, the only synagogue built during the fascist period, the [[:it:Sinagoga di Genova|Synagogue of Genoa]], was inaugurated.\n\nGenoa also gave rise to numerous industries like the steelworks \"S.I.A.C.\" in [[Cornigliano]], the metallurgical company \"F.I.T.\", the oil refining company \"IPLOM SpA\", and the energy company [[Edoardo Raffinerie Garrone|ERG]]. In 1921 Carlo Guzzi, together with Angelo and Giorgio Parodi, founded [[Moto Guzzi]] in Genoa. In 1922 the city was the headquarters for the financial and economic conference called the [[Genoa Conference (1922)|Genoa Conference]] that was a consequence of the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|Treaty of Rapallo]].\n\nDuring the fascist period the city of Genoa was united to nineteen municipalities, creating in 1926 what was known as \"[[Greater Genoa]]\", which stretches along the coast for 35&nbsp;km (22 miles).\n\nIn [[World War II]] Genoa [[Bombing of Genoa in World War II|suffered heavy damage from both naval and aerial bombing raids]]. After some ineffectual air raids in 1940, in February 1941 the city suffered heavy damage in a naval bombardment carried out by the British [[Force H]] ([[Operation Grog]]); then, in the autumn of 1942, it became the first city in Italy to experience [[area bombing]], with six such raids between 22 October and 15 November 1942 and a further one on 8 August 1943.<ref>Giorgio Bonacina, ''Comando Bombardieri - Operazione Europ''a, pp. 49-50.</ref> Between late 1943 and the end of the war, both the RAF and the USAAF carried out several more bombing raids aimed at the port facilities, factories and marshalling yards of Genoa. Overall, Genoa suffered over fifty air raids, which caused some 2,000 deaths among the population.<ref>[https://www.unive.it/media/allegato/dep/n13-14-2010/Ricerche/casi/2_Baldoli.pdf I bombardamenti sull\u2019Italia nella\nSeconda Guerra Mondiale]</ref> 11,183 buildings were destroyed or damaged, including 70 churches and 130 historic palaces, and 75 % of the port facilities were destroyed.<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/genova_res-de137645-87e5-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/ Enciclopedia Treccani]</ref>\n\nDuring this period the exploits of admiral [[Luigi Durand de la Penne]], especially the ''[[Raid on Alexandria (1941)|Raid on Alexandria]]'', are retold in several films including: ''[[The Valiant (1962 film)|The Valiant]]'', ''[[The Silent Enemy (1958 film)|The Silent Enemy]]'' or [[Human Torpedoes]].\n\nAfter the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], Genoa and the surrounding mountains became a center of the [[Italian Resistance]]; between 1943 and 1945, 1,836 Genoese partisans were killed, and 2,250 anti-fascists were deported from the city to [[concentration camp]]s in Germany.<ref>[http://www.museidigenova.it/it/content/l%E2%80%99-atto-di-resa-delle-truppe-tedesche L'atto di resa delle truppe tedesche]</ref> The city was liberated by the [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] a few days before the arrival of the Allies; 150 partisans were killed and 350 wounded during the fighting for the liberation of the city, which resulted in the capture of 14,000 German prisoners under General G\u00fcnther Meinhold on 27 April 1945.<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/genova_res-de137645-87e5-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/ Enciclopedia Treccani]</ref><ref>Basil Davidson, ''Special Operations Europe: Scenes from the Anti-Nazi War'' (1980), pp. 340/360</ref> \n\nDuring World War II, many [[Jew|Jewish]] refugees gathered in Genoa because the city was the headquarters of the [[DELASEM|Delegation for the Assistance of Jewish Emigrants]], an organization that coordinated aid and rescue programs. The office in Genoa was headed initially by [[Lelio Vittorio Valobra]], and later Massimo Teglio, who received help from local priests and created a regional rescue network.<ref name=\"bh.org.il\">{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Genoa |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/genoa |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe German search for Jews in Genoa began on November 2, 1943, when two police agents visited the offices of the Jewish community and forced the custodians to turn over their membership lists and summon members to a synagogue meeting the next morning. Many Jews had already left the city by that time, but a majority of those who were seized in Genoa were taken at this meeting. A few members who received the summons were able to escape thanks to a warning from Massimo Teglio. Rabbi [[Riccardo Pacifici]], who until the last moment tried to help other Jews, was captured in the Galleria Mazzini in November of that year. He died at Auschwitz.<ref name=\"bh.org.il\" />\n\nIn the post-war years, Genoa played a pivotal role in the [[Italian economic miracle]], as the third corner of the so-called [[Northern Italy#Economy|Industrial Triangle]], formed with the manufacturing hubs of Milan and Turin. Since 1962, the [[Genoa International Boat Show]] has evolved into one of the largest annual events in Genoa. The city became an important industrial centre, giving rise to manufacturers of diving equipment ([[Cressi-Sub]], [[Mares (scuba gear company)|Mares]], and Techisub SpA), ferries (GNV and [[Home Lines]], and the \"OSN-Orizzonti Sistemi Navali\"), oil production (\"IP-Italiana Petroli\"), textiles ([[SLAM (clothing)|SLAM]]), food services (\"Elah Dufour\" and \"Sogegross\"), construction (\"FISIA-Italimpianti\"), and, for a time, nuclear reactors (NIRA, which closed after the [[Chernobyl disaster]]).\n\nBecause of population growth, partly due to substantial immigration from other parts of Italy, new neighborhoods have been built. There were years of building speculation and of destruction of two historic districts of the city, the first in 1964 called \"Piccapietra-Portoria\" and the second in 1974 called \"Madre di Dio\" location of the house of [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini|Paganini]]; both events left indelible scars on the city and in the memory of citizens. In 1965 the political party [[Lotta Comunista]] was founded by [[Arrigo Cervetto]] and [[Lorenzo Parodi]]. A shipwreck in 1970 off the coast of Genoa the [[SS London Valour]]is the theme of a song by local minstrel [[Fabrizio De Andr\u00e8]] entitled \"Parlando del Naufragio della London Valour\", or \"Talking about the sinking of the London Valour\". In 1970 the Greek student [[Kostas Georgakis]] set himself ablaze in Matteotti Square, Genoa, as a protest against the dictatorial regime of [[Georgios Papadopoulos]]. In this period Genoa was the centre of protest movements that sometimes take the form of armed struggle. In the so-called [[Years of Lead]], the [[Red Brigades]] formed a very active column in Genoa called [[October 22 Group]], which in 1974 kidnapped magistrate Mario Sossi and in 1979 killed worker [[:it:Guido Rossa|Guido Rossa]] and professor [[Fausto Cuocolo]]. In 1980 the Genoese Red Brigades group was eliminated at the hands of a special detachment under the orders of [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]].\n\nIn 1991 the [[MT Haven]] was shipwrecked off the coast of Genoa, but 1992 marks the rebirth of the city with [[Genoa Expo '92]]. Genoa, city home of [[Christopher Columbus]], celebrated the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America. For the occasion, thanks to the intervention of the architect [[Renzo Piano]], the Old Harbour smartened up its face.\n\nThe [[27th G8 summit]] in the city, in July 2001, was overshadowed by violent protests ([[Anti-globalization movement|Anti-globalisation movement]]), with one protester, [[Carlo Giuliani]], killed. In 2007, 15 officials, including police, prison officials and two doctors, were found guilty by an Italian court of mistreating protesters ([[2001 Raid on Armando Diaz]]). Their prison sentences ranged from five months to five years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7506609.stm |title=Italy officials convicted over G8|publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-15 |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref> In 2004, the [[European Union]] designated Genoa as the [[European Capital of Culture]], along with the French city of [[Lille]]. In 2009 the Genoese actor and political activist [[Beppe Grillo]] founded the [[Five Star Movement]]. In 2011, Genoa, like other European cities, suffered disastrous [[2011 European floods|flooding]]. In 2013, 11 deaths resulted from the collapse of the control tower of Genoa's port after being hit by the cargo ship [[:it:Jolly Nero|Jolly Nero]]. In 2014, the sunken wreck from the [[Costa Concordia disaster|Costa Concordia]] was transported to the port of Genoa to be broken up.\n\n14 August 2018 was a black day for Genoa: the [[Ponte Morandi]] bridge collapsed, killing 43 people.<ref name=dead>[https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2018/08/18/news/crollo_genova_trovati_i_corpi_di_tre_dei_dispersi-204360358/?ref=RHPPLF-BH-I0-C8-P1-S1.8-T2 Crollo Genova, trovato l'ultimo disperso sotto le macerie: \u00e8 l'operaio Mirko.

In the 5th century BC the first town, or [[oppidum]], was founded at the top of the hill today called Castello (Castle), which is now inside the medieval old town. The ancient [[Ligures|Ligurian]] city was known as Stalia (\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u00ec\u03b1), referred to in this way by [[Artemidorus Ephesius]] and [[Pomponius Mela]]; this toponym is possibly preserved in the name of Staglieno, some {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} from the coast. Ligurian Stalia was overshadowed by the powerful [[Marseille]] and [[Vada Sabatia]], near modern [[Savona]]. Stalia had an alliance with [[Roman Republic|Rome]] through a ''foedus aequum'' (equal pact) in the course of the [[Second Punic War]] (218-201&nbsp;BC). The [[Carthaginians]] accordingly destroyed it in 209&nbsp;BC. The town was rebuilt and, after the [[Carthaginian Wars]] ended in 146&nbsp;BC, it received municipal rights. The original ''castrum'' expanded after that towards the current areas of Santa Maria di Castello and the San Lorenzo promontory. Trades included skins, wood, and honey. Goods were shipped to the mainland, up to major cities like [[Tortona]] and [[Piacenza]]. An amphitheater was also found there among the archeological remains from the Roman period.\n\n[[File:TavolaPolcevera.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Polcevera]] bronze tablet, evidence of Genoa's Roman and pre-Roman past]]\n\nThe city's modern name may derive from the [[Latin]] word meaning \"knee\" (''genu''; plural, ''genua'') but there are other theories. It could derive from the god [[Janus]], because Genoa, like him, has two faces: a face that looks at the sea and another turned to the mountains. Or it could come from the Latin word ''ianua'', also related to the name of the God Janus, and meaning \"door\" or \"passage.\" Besides that, it may refer to its geographical position at the centre of the Ligurian coastal arch, thus akin to the name of [[Geneva]].<ref>Giulia Petracco Sicardi, \"Genova\", in ''Dizionario di toponomastica'', Torino, 1990, p. 355. In [[Genoa Cathedral|Cathedral]] there is an inscription that says ''Janus, primus Rex Italiae de progenie gigantum, qui fundavit Genuam temporae Abrahae'', in English, \"Janus, the first King of Italy, progeny of the giants, who founded Genoa in the days of Abraham.\"\n \nAnother theory traces the name to the Etruscan word ''Kainua'' which means \"New City\". Piera Melli (''Genova Preromana'', 2007), based on an inscription on a pottery sherd reading ''Kainua'', suggests that the Latin name may be a corruption of an older Etruscan one with an original meaning of \"new town\".</ref> The Latin name, ''oppidum Genua'', is recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Nat. Hist.]]'' 3.48) as part of the [[Augustus|Augustean]] ''[[Regio IX Liguria]]''.\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the [[Ostrogoths]] occupied Genoa. After the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] made it the seat of their [[vicar]]. When the [[Lombards]] invaded Italy in 568, Bishop Honoratus of [[Bishopric of Milan|Milan]] fled and held his seat in Genoa.<ref>Paul the Deacon, Historia Langobardorum, II.25</ref> Pope [[Gregory the Great]] was closely connected to these bishops in exile, for example involving himself in the election of Deusdedit.<ref>Gregory I, Registrum Epistolarum, MGH Ep. 2, XI.14, p. 274</ref> The Lombards, under King [[Rothari]], finally captured Genoa and other Ligurian cities in about 643.<ref>Paul the Deacon, Historia Langobardorum, IV.45</ref> In 725 the mortal remains of [[Augustine of Hippo]] arrived in Genoa. In 773 the Lombard Kingdom was annexed by the [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish Empire]]; the first Carolingian count of Genoa was Ademarus, who was given the title ''praefectus civitatis Genuensis''. Ademarus died in [[Corsica]] while fighting against the Saracens. In this period the Roman walls, destroyed by the Lombards, were rebuilt and extended.\n\nFor the following several centuries, Genoa was little more than a small centre, slowly building its merchant fleet, which was to become the leading commercial carrier of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The town was [[Fatimid sack of Genoa|thoroughly sacked and burned]] in 934\u201335 by a [[Fatimid fleet]] under [[Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Tamimi]] and possibly even abandoned for a few years.<ref>Steven A. Epstein, ''Genoa and the Genoese, 958-1528. (The University of North Carolina Press, 1996), p. 14''</ref> In the 10th century the city, now part of the ''[[March of Genoa|Marca Januensis]]'' was under the [[Obertenghi]] family, whose first member was [[Oberto I|Obertus I]]. Genoa became one of the first cities in Italy to have some citizenship rights granted by local feudatories.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Middle ages and Renaissance==\n{{Main article|Republic of Genoa}}\n[[File:Ridolfo Ghirlandaio Columbus.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Christopher Columbus]] by [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio]]]]\n\nBefore 1100, Genoa emerged as an independent [[city-state]], one of a number of [[Italian city-states]] established during this period. Nominally, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] was sovereign and the [[Bishop of Genoa]] was head of state; however, actual power was wielded by a number of [[consul]]s annually elected by popular assembly. Genoa was one of the states known as ''[[Maritime republics|Repubbliche Marinare]]'' along with [[Venice]], [[Pisa]], and [[Amalfi]]. Trade, shipbuilding, and banking helped support one of the largest and most powerful navies in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. There is an old saying that says: ''Genuensis ergo mercator'', or \"A Genoese therefore a merchant\" but the Genoese were skilled sailors and ferocious warriors in addition (see also the [[Genoese crossbowmen]]). \n\nIn 1098, it is said the ashes of [[John the Baptist]], now the patron saint of the city, arrived in Genoa. The [[Adorno (family)|Adorno]], Campofregoso, and other smaller merchant families all fought for power in this republic, as the power of the consuls allowed each family faction to gain wealth and power in the city. The [[Republic of Genoa]] extended over modern [[Liguria]], [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], [[Sardinia]] (see also [[Pisan-Genoese expeditions to Sardinia]]), [[Corsica]], and [[County of Nice|Nice]], and had practically complete control of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. Through Genoese participation in the [[Crusades]], colonies were established in the [[Middle East]], the [[Aegean Sea]], [[Sicily]], and [[Northern Africa]]. The ''cronista'', or chronicler, of the Genoese vicissitudes was [[Caffaro di Rustico da Caschifellone]] and the hero and military leader was [[Guglielmo Embriaco]] called ''Testadimaglio'' meaning \"mallet head\" (see also [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)]]). Genoese Crusaders brought home a green glass goblet from the [[Levant]] (see also [[Holy Chalice]]), which the Genoese have long regarded as the [[Holy Grail]]. In his ''[[Golden Legend]]'', the Archbishop of Genoa, [[Jacobus de Voragine]] relates the history of the Holy Grail. \nNot all of Genoa's merchandise was so innocuous, however, as medieval Genoa became a major player in the slave trade.<ref>Steven A. Epstein, ''Speaking of Slavery: Color, Ethnicity and Human Bondage in Italy (Conjunctions of Religion and Power in the Medieval Past''</ref>\n\nThe Genoese have a claim to the creation of the rough denim cloth then called \"Blue Jean\", from which derives the modern name of [[jeans]], used by sailors for work and to cover and protect their goods on the docks from the weather. During the [[Republic of Genoa]], Genoese merchants and sailors exported this cloth throughout Europe. The production of [[Genoese lace]] was also notable.\n\n[[File:CroppedLanterna.JPG|thumb|left|The iconic ''[[Torre della Lanterna|Lanterna]]'', renaissance lighthouse of Genoa was built in 1543.]]\n\nThe collapse of the [[Crusader States]] was offset by Genoa's alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. As Venice's relations with the Byzantines were temporarily disrupted by the [[Fourth Crusade]] and its aftermath, Genoa was able to improve its position, taking advantage of the opportunity to expand into the [[Black Sea]] and [[Crimea]]. Internal feuds between the powerful families, the [[House of Grimaldi|Grimaldi]] and [[Fieschi]], the [[Doria (family)|Doria]], [[Spinola Family|Spinola]] and others, caused much disruption, but in general the republic was run much as a business affair.\n\nIn 1218\u20131220 Genoa was served by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] ''[[podest\u00e0]]'' [[Rambertino Buvalelli]], who probably introduced [[Occitan literature]], which was soon to boast such [[troubadour]]s as [[Jacme Grils]], [[Lanfranc Cigala]] and [[Bonifaci Calvo]], to the city. During this time, 1218\u20131219, a Genoese fleet under [[Simone Doria (admiral)|Simone Doria]] with the famous Genoese pirate [[Alamanno da Costa]] participated in the [[Siege of Damietta (1218-1219)|Siege of Damietta]]; about this period we must also remember the Genoese [[privateer]] and [[pirate]], [[Henry, Count of Malta]]. The alliance between Byzantines and Genoese suffered after the [[Battle of Settepozzi]], admirably described in the [[Annales ianuenses]]. \n\nGenoa's political zenith came with its victory over the [[Republic of Pisa]] at the naval [[Battle of Meloria (1284)|Battle of Meloria]] in 1284, and with a temporary victory over its rival, Venice, at the naval [[Battle of Curzola]] in 1298 during the [[Venetian-Genoese Wars]]. The Genoese navy was on a par with the Venetian navy and both cities had the power to rule the sea. Notable conflicts between Byzantines and Genoese were the [[Genoese occupation of Rhodes]] and the [[Byzantine-Genoese War (1348-49)|Byzantine-Genoese War]].\n\nHowever, this period of prosperity did not last. The [[Black Death]] is said to have been imported into Europe in 1347 from the Genoese trading post at [[Feodosia|Caffa]] in Crimea on the Black Sea. Following the economic and population collapse that resulted, Genoa adopted the [[Doge|Venetian model of government]] and was presided over by the [[Doge of Genoa]]. The wars with Venice continued, and the [[War of Chioggia]] (1378\u20131381) \u2013 during which Genoa almost managed to decisively subdue Venice \u2013 ended with Venice's recovery of dominance in the Adriatic. In 1390, Genoa initiated the [[Barbary Crusade]], with help from the French, and laid siege to [[Mahdia]], the Fatimid capital of Ifriqiya.\n\nThough not well-studied, Genoa in the 15th century seems to have been tumultuous. The city had a strong tradition of trading goods from the Levant and its financial expertise was recognised all over Europe. After a period of French domination from 1394 to 1409, Genoa came under the rule of the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] of [[Milan]] (see also [[Battle of Ponza (1435)|Battle of Ponza]]). Genoa lost [[Sardinia]] to [[Aragon]], [[Corsica]] to internal revolt, and its [[Middle East]]ern, [[Eastern Europe]]an, and [[Asia Minor]] colonies to the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nIn the 15th century two of the earliest banks in the world were founded in Genoa: the [[Bank of Saint George]], founded in 1407, which was the oldest chartered bank in the world at its closure in 1805 and the [[Banca Carige]], founded in 1483 as a [[mount of piety]], which still exists.\n\nGenoa was able to stabilise its position as it moved into the 16th century, particularly as a result of the efforts of Doge [[Andrea Doria]], who granted a new constitution in 1528 that made Genoa a satellite of the Spanish Empire ([[Siege of Coron]] 1532/34, [[Battle of Preveza]] 1538, [[Battle of Girolata]] 1540, [[Battle of Lepanto]] 1571, [[Relief of Genoa]] 1625). Some Genoese enjoyed remarkable careers in the service of the Spanish crown: notably the maritime explorers [[Juan Bautista Pastene]] and [[Leon Pancaldo]], the general [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases|Ambrogio Spinola]], the naval captain [[Cruz Family|Giovanni della Croce Bernardotte]] and Jorge Burgues. In the period of economic recovery which followed, many aristocratic Genoese families, such as the Balbi, Doria, Grimaldi, Pallavicini and Serra, amassed tremendous fortunes. According to Felipe Fernandez-Armesto and others, the practices Genoa developed in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] (such as chattel slavery) were crucial in the exploration and exploitation of the New World.<ref>''Before Columbus: Exploration and Colonization from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, 1229\u20131492''</ref> \n\nThe Genoese [[Pietro Vesconte]], [[Giovanni da Carignano]] and [[Battista Beccario]] (see [[Genoese map]] before the discovery of the Americas) were pioneers in cartography. [[Christopher Columbus]] himself was a native of Genoa and donated one-tenth of his income from the discovery of the [[Americas]] for [[Spain]] to the [[Bank of Saint George]] in Genoa for the relief of general taxation on food. Columbus was the culmination of a long tradition of Genoese navigators and explorers such as [[Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi]], [[Lancelotto Malocello]], [[Luca Tarigo]], [[Antonio de Noli]], [[Antonio Malfante]] and [[Antoniotto Usodimare]]. (It has been suggested that Antoniotto Usodimare and Antonio di Noli may be different names for the same person.) The famous Genoese navigator [[John Cabot]], a contemporary of Columbus, discovered northern parts of North America when sailing under the commission of [[Henry VII of England]].\n\nDuring its rise and its apogee, Genoa founded [[Genoese colonies|colonies]] in many parts of the world from Crimea to North Africa, from Spain to the Americas, leaving valuable architectural works in many locations, such as the forts of [[Caffa]], [[Balaklava]], [[Sudak]] and [[Tabarka]], the [[Galata Tower]] in [[Istanbul]], the [[Genoese Lighthouse|Lighthouse]] in Constan\u021ba, the [[Genoese towers in Corsica|Towers]] in Corsica and Sardinia. The Genoese established commercial bases and colonies around the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, called [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|Gazaria]]. They established flourishing communities in Constantinople, C\u00e1diz, Lisbon and Gibraltar (see also [[History of the Genoese in Gibraltar]] and [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantines]]); these communities were organised and governed by [[Maona]] (see also [[Maona di Chio e di Focea|Chio's Maona and Focea]]). The story of [[Cigalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha]] or Scipione Cicala, member of the aristocratic Genoese family of Cicala, is fascinating: it is said he was caught by the Ottomans in the [[Battle of Djerba]] and then he became Kapudan Pasha or Grand Admiral of the Ottoman fleet, (this adventure story is sung by [[Fabrizio De Andr\u00e9]] in \"Sin\u00e0n Capud\u00e0n Pasci\u00e0\").\n\n[[File:Braun Genova UBHD.jpg|thumb|300px|View of Genoa in 1572]]\n\nAt the time of Genoa's zenith in the 16th century, the city attracted many artists including [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Van Dyck]]. The famed architect [[Galeazzo Alessi]] (1512\u20131572) designed many of the city's splendid [[palazzo|palazzi]], and [[Bartolomeo Bianco]] (1590\u20131657) designed the centrepieces of the [[University of Genoa]]. A number of [[Genoese Baroque and Rococo artists]] settled elsewhere and a number of local artists became prominent. In the late sixteenth century, [[Luca Cambiaso]], known as the founder of the Genoese School of painting, went on to earn the largest payment then recorded (2,000 ducats) for work for Philip II of Spain in the Escorial palace in Madrid.\n\nIn the 17th century, however, Genoa entered a period of crisis. In May 1625, a French-Savoian army invaded the republic but was [[Relief of Genoa|successfully driven out]] by the combined Spanish and Genoese armies. In 1656-57, a new outburst of [[Naples Plague|plague]] killed as many as half of the population.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297474/Italy/27687/Early-modern-Italy-16th-to-18th-centuries Early modern Italy (16th to 18th centuries) \u00bb The 17th century crisis] ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.''</ref> In May 1684, as a punishment for Genoese support for Spain, the city was [[Bombardment of Genoa|subjected to a French naval bombardment]] with some 13,000 cannonballs aimed at the city.<ref>[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/17cen/genoa1684.html ''Genoa 1684''], World History at KMLA.</ref> Genoa was eventually occupied by [[Austria]] in 1746 during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. This episode in the city's history is mainly remembered for the Genoese revolt, precipitated by a legendary boy named Giovan Battista Perasso and nicknamed [[Balilla]] who threw a stone at an Austrian official and became a national hero to later generations of Genoese, and Italians in general (''see also'' [[Siege of Genoa (1746)]], [[Siege of Genoa (1747)]], and [[Siege of Genoa (1800)]]). Unable to retain its rule in [[Corsica]], where the rebel [[Corsican Republic]] was proclaimed in 1755, Genoa was forced by the well-supported rebellion to sell its claim to Corsica to the French, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles (1768)|Treaty of Versailles]] of 1768.\n\n==Modern history==\nWith the shift in world economy and trade routes to the New World and away from the Mediterranean, Genoa's political and economic power began a steady decline. Its military power collapsed during the [[Raid on Genoa]] in 1793 and the [[Battle of Genoa (1795)|Battle of Genoa]] in 1795 where Genoa fought the French fleet and the English. In 1797, under pressure from [[Napoleon]], the [[Republic of Genoa]] became a French protectorate called the [[Ligurian Republic]], which was annexed by France in 1805. This fact is mentioned in the first sentence of [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'':\n{{bquote|Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes.(...) And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at Milan, the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions [to be annexed to France] before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations?\" (spoken by a thoroughly anti-Bonapartist Russian aristocrat, soon after the news reached [[Saint Petersburg]]).}}\n\nAlthough the Genoese revolted against France in 1814 and liberated the city on their own, delegates at the [[Congress of Vienna]] sanctioned its incorporation into the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], thus ending the three century old struggle by the [[House of Savoy]] to acquire the city.\n\n[[File:Partenza da Quarto.jpg|thumb|Garibaldi leading the [[Expedition of the Thousand]]]]\n\nThe city soon gained a reputation as a hotbed of anti-Savoy republican agitation. Genoa was the centre of an important reform movement that put constant pressure on Piedmont to grant the freedom of the press and more liberal laws. The citizens of the republic would not accept being subjects of an absolute monarchy, wanting to be Italian rather than Piedmontese, though relations with Piedmont improved with the war against Austria. However, after the defeat in the [[First Italian War of Independence|First War of Independence]] and the armistice of Salasco, the Genoese, fearing the loss of freedom and independence as a consequence of a peace imposed by Austria, rose up and hunted the Piedmontese garrison. After the [[Revolt of Genoa|uprising of Genoa]], the troops of the general [[Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora]] moved against the city, besieged, bombed and sacked it. With the rise of the [[Risorgimento]], reunification of Italy, movement, the Genoese turned their struggles from [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]'s vision of a local republic into a struggle for a unified Italy under a liberalised Savoy monarchy. In 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] set out from Genoa with over a [[Expedition of the Thousand|thousand]] volunteers to begin the conquest of [[Southern Italy]] among them was [[Nino Bixio]]. Today a monument is set on the rock at the point where the patriot embarked, in [[Quarto dei Mille]].\n\n[[File:Genova-1810ca-acquatinta-Garneray-part-mura.jpg|thumb|left|Genoa in 1810]]\n\nIn the 19th and the early 20th centuries, Genoa consolidated its role as a major seaport and an important steel and shipbuilding centre. In Genoa in 1853, [[:it:Giovanni Ansaldo|Giovanni Ansaldo]] founded [[Gio. Ansaldo & C.]] whose shipyards would build some of the most beautiful ships in the world, such as [[ARA Garibaldi]], [[SS Roma (1926)|SS Roma]], [[MS Augustus]], [[SS Rex]], [[SS Andrea Doria]], [[SS Cristoforo Colombo]], [[MS Gripsholm (1957)|MS Gripsholm]], [[SS Leonardo da Vinci]], [[SS Michelangelo]], and [[SS SeaBreeze]]. In 1854, the ferry company [[Costa Crociere]] was founded in Genoa and then the Lloyd Italiano maritime insurance company. In 1861 the [[Registro Italiano Navale]] Italian register of shipping was created, and in 1879 the [[Yacht Club Italiano]]. The owner [[:it:Raffaele Rubarrino|Raffaele Rubattino]] in 1881 was among the founders of the ferry company [[Navigazione Generale Italiana]] which then become the [[Italian Line]]. \n\nIn 1884 [[:it:Rinaldo Piaggio|Rinaldo Piaggio]] founded [[Piaggio|Piaggio & C.]] that produced locomotives and railway carriages and in 1923 began aircraft production. The company as [[Piaggio Aerospace]] at present is owned by [[Mubadala Development Company]] and is based in [[Villanova d'Albenga]]. (After World War II, [[Enrico Piaggio]] son of Rinaldo Piaggio, with the engineer [[Corradino D'Ascanio]] conceived and realised one of the most common means of transport, the [[Vespa]]). In 1870 was founded Banca di Genova which in 1895 changed its name to [[Credito Italiano]] and in 1998 became [[Unicredit]]. Also in Genoa in 1898 the insurance company called [[Alleanza Assicurazioni]] was founded. In 1874 the city was completely connected by railway lines to France and the rest of Italy: [[Turin-Genoa railway|Genoa-Turin]], [[Genoa-Ventimiglia railway|Genoa-Ventimiglia]], [[Pisa-La Spezia-Genoa railway|Genoa-Pisa]]. \n\nIn Genoa the following shipyards were established: Cantiere Navale di Sestri Ponente, [[Cantiere della Foce]], [[Cantiere navale di Riva Trigoso]], Cantieri navali di Voltri but also the sugar factory Eridania, the food brands Saiwa, Elah and Icat Food. These technological and industrial developments would have worldwide exposure in 1892 when the city hosted the international exhibition \"Esposizione Italo-Americana\" and again in 1914 with the [[International exhibition of marine and maritime hygiene|Esposizione Internazionale di Marina e di igiene marinara]] (see the [[List of world's fairs]]). The strong industrialisation attracted large masses of workers which is why in 1892 the [[Italian Socialist Party]] was founded here by [[Filippo Turati]], [[Andrea Costa]], and [[Anna Kuliscioff]]. In 1886 was founded the newspaper [[Il Secolo XIX]] and in 1903 the socialist newspaper \"Il Lavoro\". [[Palmiro Togliatti]], one of the most influential Italian politicians of the 20th century, was born in Genoa in 1893.\n\nIn this period many Genoese emigrated to the [[Americas]] (see also [[Italian diaspora]]). Among the most interesting experiences of this exodus was the creation of the [[Buenos Aires]] district called [[La Boca]], now famous for its colorful houses in the Ligurian style, in addition on 3 April 1905 a group of Genoese boys founded the [[Boca Juniors]] football club in Buenos Aires. This is why the fans of Boca Juniors are called \"Los Xeneizes\", which means the Genoese. In addition, [[Amadeo Giannini]], the son of Genoese immigrants in North America, founded the [[Bank of America]]. (See also \"[[Italian Peruvians]]\", \"[[Italian Chileans]]\", \"[[Italian Uruguayans]]\").\n\nDuring [[World War I]] the Genoese shipyards were very active, importing vast quantities of materials necessary for the war effort, and between thirty thousand and eighty thousand Genoese left for the battlefront. About this period we have to remember the admiral [[Raffaele Rossetti]], famous for the sinking of the battleship [[SMS Viribus Unitis]]. Important urban and architectural works were constructed under [[Fascism]] including: [[:it:Piazza Dante (Genova)|Piazza Dante]] which includes the [[Terrazza Martini Tower|Piacentini's Tower]], [[:it:Piazza della Vittoria (Genova)|Piazza della Vittoria]] with its[[Arco della Vittoria]], and the Bisagno stream water tunnel. In 1935, the only synagogue built during the fascist period, the [[:it:Sinagoga di Genova|Synagogue of Genoa]], was inaugurated.\n\nGenoa also gave rise to numerous industries like the steelworks \"S.I.A.C.\" in [[Cornigliano]], the metallurgical company \"F.I.T.\", the oil refining company \"IPLOM SpA\", and the energy company [[Edoardo Raffinerie Garrone|ERG]]. In 1921 Carlo Guzzi, together with Angelo and Giorgio Parodi, founded [[Moto Guzzi]] in Genoa. In 1922 the city was the headquarters for the financial and economic conference called the [[Genoa Conference (1922)|Genoa Conference]] that was a consequence of the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|Treaty of Rapallo]].\n\nDuring the fascist period the city of Genoa was united to nineteen municipalities, creating in 1926 what was known as \"[[Greater Genoa]]\", which stretches along the coast for 35&nbsp;km (22 miles).\n\nIn [[World War II]] Genoa [[Bombing of Genoa in World War II|suffered heavy damage from both naval and aerial bombing raids]]. After some ineffectual air raids in 1940, in February 1941 the city suffered heavy damage in a naval bombardment carried out by the British [[Force H]] ([[Operation Grog]]); then, in the autumn of 1942, it became the first city in Italy to experience [[area bombing]], with six such raids between 22 October and 15 November 1942 and a further one on 8 August 1943.<ref>Giorgio Bonacina, ''Comando Bombardieri - Operazione Europ''a, pp. 49-50.</ref> Between late 1943 and the end of the war, both the RAF and the USAAF carried out several more bombing raids aimed at the port facilities, factories and marshalling yards of Genoa. Overall, Genoa suffered over fifty air raids, which caused some 2,000 deaths among the population.<ref>[https://www.unive.it/media/allegato/dep/n13-14-2010/Ricerche/casi/2_Baldoli.pdf I bombardamenti sull\u2019Italia nella\nSeconda Guerra Mondiale]</ref> 11,183 buildings were destroyed or damaged, including 70 churches and 130 historic palaces, and 75 % of the port facilities were destroyed.<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/genova_res-de137645-87e5-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/ Enciclopedia Treccani]</ref>\n\nDuring this period the exploits of admiral [[Luigi Durand de la Penne]], especially the ''[[Raid on Alexandria (1941)|Raid on Alexandria]]'', are retold in several films including: ''[[The Valiant (1962 film)|The Valiant]]'', ''[[The Silent Enemy (1958 film)|The Silent Enemy]]'' or [[Human Torpedoes]].\n\nAfter the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], Genoa and the surrounding mountains became a center of the [[Italian Resistance]]; between 1943 and 1945, 1,836 Genoese partisans were killed, and 2,250 anti-fascists were deported from the city to [[concentration camp]]s in Germany.<ref>[http://www.museidigenova.it/it/content/l%E2%80%99-atto-di-resa-delle-truppe-tedesche L'atto di resa delle truppe tedesche]</ref> The city was liberated by the [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] a few days before the arrival of the Allies; 150 partisans were killed and 350 wounded during the fighting for the liberation of the city, which resulted in the capture of 14,000 German prisoners under General G\u00fcnther Meinhold on 27 April 1945.<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/genova_res-de137645-87e5-11dc-8e9d-0016357eee51_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/ Enciclopedia Treccani]</ref><ref>Basil Davidson, ''Special Operations Europe: Scenes from the Anti-Nazi War'' (1980), pp. 340/360</ref> \n\nDuring World War II, many [[Jew|Jewish]] refugees gathered in Genoa because the city was the headquarters of the [[DELASEM|Delegation for the Assistance of Jewish Emigrants]], an organization that coordinated aid and rescue programs. The office in Genoa was headed initially by [[Lelio Vittorio Valobra]], and later Massimo Teglio, who received help from local priests and created a regional rescue network.<ref name=\"bh.org.il\">{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Genoa |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/genoa |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe German search for Jews in Genoa began on November 2, 1943, when two police agents visited the offices of the Jewish community and forced the custodians to turn over their membership lists and summon members to a synagogue meeting the next morning. Many Jews had already left the city by that time, but a majority of those who were seized in Genoa were taken at this meeting. A few members who received the summons were able to escape thanks to a warning from Massimo Teglio. Rabbi [[Riccardo Pacifici]], who until the last moment tried to help other Jews, was captured in the Galleria Mazzini in November of that year. He died at Auschwitz.<ref name=\"bh.org.il\" />\n\nIn the post-war years, Genoa played a pivotal role in the [[Italian economic miracle]], as the third corner of the so-called [[Northern Italy#Economy|Industrial Triangle]], formed with the manufacturing hubs of Milan and Turin. Since 1962, the [[Genoa International Boat Show]] has evolved into one of the largest annual events in Genoa. The city became an important industrial centre, giving rise to manufacturers of diving equipment ([[Cressi-Sub]], [[Mares (scuba gear company)|Mares]], and Techisub SpA), ferries (GNV and [[Home Lines]], and the \"OSN-Orizzonti Sistemi Navali\"), oil production (\"IP-Italiana Petroli\"), textiles ([[SLAM (clothing)|SLAM]]), food services (\"Elah Dufour\" and \"Sogegross\"), construction (\"FISIA-Italimpianti\"), and, for a time, nuclear reactors (NIRA, which closed after the [[Chernobyl disaster]]).\n\nBecause of population growth, partly due to substantial immigration from other parts of Italy, new neighborhoods have been built. There were years of building speculation and of destruction of two historic districts of the city, the first in 1964 called \"Piccapietra-Portoria\" and the second in 1974 called \"Madre di Dio\" location of the house of [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini|Paganini]]; both events left indelible scars on the city and in the memory of citizens. In 1965 the political party [[Lotta Comunista]] was founded by [[Arrigo Cervetto]] and [[Lorenzo Parodi]]. A shipwreck in 1970 off the coast of Genoa the [[SS London Valour]]is the theme of a song by local minstrel [[Fabrizio De Andr\u00e8]] entitled \"Parlando del Naufragio della London Valour\", or \"Talking about the sinking of the London Valour\". In 1970 the Greek student [[Kostas Georgakis]] set himself ablaze in Matteotti Square, Genoa, as a protest against the dictatorial regime of [[Georgios Papadopoulos]]. In this period Genoa was the centre of protest movements that sometimes take the form of armed struggle. In the so-called [[Years of Lead]], the [[Red Brigades]] formed a very active column in Genoa called [[October 22 Group]], which in 1974 kidnapped magistrate Mario Sossi and in 1979 killed worker [[:it:Guido Rossa|Guido Rossa]] and professor [[Fausto Cuocolo]]. In 1980 the Genoese Red Brigades group was eliminated at the hands of a special detachment under the orders of [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]].\n\nIn 1991 the [[MT Haven]] was shipwrecked off the coast of Genoa, but 1992 marks the rebirth of the city with [[Genoa Expo '92]]. Genoa, city home of [[Christopher Columbus]], celebrated the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America. For the occasion, thanks to the intervention of the architect [[Renzo Piano]], the Old Harbour smartened up its face.\n\nThe [[27th G8 summit]] in the city, in July 2001, was overshadowed by violent protests ([[Anti-globalization movement|Anti-globalisation movement]]), with one protester, [[Carlo Giuliani]], killed. In 2007, 15 officials, including police, prison officials and two doctors, were found guilty by an Italian court of mistreating protesters ([[2001 Raid on Armando Diaz]]). Their prison sentences ranged from five months to five years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7506609.stm |title=Italy officials convicted over G8|publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-15 |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref> In 2004, the [[European Union]] designated Genoa as the [[European Capital of Culture]], along with the French city of [[Lille]]. In 2009 the Genoese actor and political activist [[Beppe Grillo]] founded the [[Five Star Movement]]. In 2011, Genoa, like other European cities, suffered disastrous [[2011 European floods|flooding]]. In 2013, 11 deaths resulted from the collapse of the control tower of Genoa's port after being hit by the cargo ship [[:it:Jolly Nero|Jolly Nero]]. In 2014, the sunken wreck from the [[Costa Concordia disaster|Costa Concordia]] was transported to the port of Genoa to be broken up.\n\n14 August 2018 was a black day for Genoa: the [[Ponte Morandi]] bridge collapsed, killing 43 people.<ref name=dead>[https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2018/08/18/news/crollo_genova_trovati_i_corpi_di_tre_dei_dispersi-204360358/?ref=RHPPLF-BH-I0-C8-P1-S1.8-T2 Crollo Genova, trovato l'ultimo disperso sotto le macerie: \u00e8 l'operaio Mirko.
