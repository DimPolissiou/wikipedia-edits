The winning submissions for the congressional redistricting were from the University of Virginia and from the College of William and Mary. The \"Division 1\" maps conformed to the Governor's Executive Order, and did not address electoral competition or representational fairness. In addition to the criteria of contiguity, equi-population, the federal ''Voting Rights Act'', and communities of interest in the existing city and county boundaries, \"Division 2\" maps in the competition did incorporate considerations of electoral competition and representational fairness. Judges for the cash award prizes were Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution and Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute.

The criteria began with respecting existing political boundaries, such as cities and towns, counties and magisterial districts, election districts and voting precincts. Districts are to be established on the basis of population, in conformance with federal and state laws and court cases, including those addressing racial fairness. The territory is to be contiguous and compact, without oddly shaped boundaries.

It made recommendations for both state legislative and congressional district redistricting, detailing three options for congressional districts, all improving on the 2001 Congressional map by reducing the number of split jurisdictions, defining three districts in the DC metro northern Virginia area, and increasing compactness in each district. In accordance with the Voting Rights Act, it maintained one majority African-American district without packing to dilute community influence in other districts.<ref>[http://cnu.edu/redistrictingcommission/final_redistricting_commission_report.pdf The Public Interest in Redistricting] Bob Holsworth, Chair for the Independent Bipartisan Advisory Commission on Redistricting, Commonwealth of Virginia, April 1, 2011, p.22-27.</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the Virginia College and University Redistricting Competition was organized by professors Michael McDonald of George Mason University and Quentin Kidd of Christopher Newport University. About 150 students on sixteen teams from thirteen schools submitted plans for legislative and U.S. Congressional districts. The winning submissions for the congressional redistricting were from the University of Virginia and from the College of William and Mary. The \"Division 1\" maps conformed to the Governor's Executive Order, and did not address electoral competition or representational fairness. In addition to the criteria of contiguity, equi-population, the federal ''Voting Rights Act'', and communities of interest in the existing city and county boundaries, \"Division 2\" maps in the competition did incorporate considerations of electoral competition and representational fairness. Judges for the cash award prizes were Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution and Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute. They also created districts more compact than the General Assembly's earlier efforts.<ref>[http://cnu.edu/redistrictingcommission/final_redistricting_commission_report.pdf The Public Interest in Redistricting] Bob Holsworth, Chair for the Independent Bipartisan Advisory Commission on Redistricting, Commonwealth of Virginia, April 1, 2011, p.9-10</ref>\n\nIn January 2015, Republican State Senator [[Jill Holtzman Vogel]] of Winchester and Democratic State Senator [[Louise Lucas]] of Portsmouth sponsored a Senate Joint Resolution to establish additional criteria for the Virginia Redistricting Commission of four identified members of political parties, and three other independent public officials. The criteria began with respecting existing political boundaries, such as cities and towns, counties and magisterial districts, election districts and voting precincts. Districts are to be established on the basis of population, in conformance with federal and state laws and court cases, including those addressing racial fairness. The territory is to be contiguous and compact, without oddly shaped boundaries. The commission is prohibited from using political data or election results to favor either political party or incumbent. It passed with a two-thirds majority of 27 to 12 in the Senate, and was referred to committee in the House of Delegates.<ref>[http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?151+ful+SJ284S1 SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 284] AMENDMENT IN THE NATURE OF A SUBSTITUTE (Proposed by the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections on January 20, 2015) (Patrons Prior to Substitute\u2014Senators Vogel and Lucas [SJR 224])</ref>\n\n===2016 redistricting===\nThe redistricting of congressional districts prepared by the Virginia legislature, the [[Virginia General Assembly]], in 2012 was used in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2014|2014 elections]].

This small, isolated, primarily [[Roman Catholic]] settlement came into existence in the mid-19th century, and encompassed for the most part the south half of Section 12, all of Section 13, the east half of Section 14, and the northeast quarter of Section 24, all of T7S-R9W, Jackson County, Mississippi.\n\nThe majority of the people of the Bayou Puerto sector made their livelihoods from the sea and forest. The sea provided fish, crustaceans, and mollusks, as well as the medium for travel and trade. Sylvan dwellers cut timber and light wood and made charcoal. Agriculturally, there were some citrus orchards and viticulture, but large traditional farms were nonexistence. Families cultivated vegetable gardens to supplement their high protein diet consisting primarily of seafood, fowl, and game.\n\nAfter 1900, there was a marked decrease in charcoal making. Virtually every male resident of Bayou Puerto in 1900 was employed in the seafood industry. Only a few Blacks were still producing charcoal, probably for local consumption.<ref>1900 Federal Census, Jackson County, Miss.</ref>\n\n===Slavery===\nSlavery in the Bayou Puerto area was almost nil, as most of the inhabitants existed at the subsistence level.\n\n===Civil War===\nNo [[Union Army|Union]] incursions occurred in the Bayou Puerto section, nor are there any records of Federal occupation here during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Some of the men left the safety and seclusion of their homes to fight for the preservation of [[slavery]] and the [[Confederate States of America]] during the war.\n\n===Millionaires' playground===\n\nAn event which permanently changed the history and culture of Bayou-Puerto and St. Martin occurred as a result of the land boom of the mid-1920s. A group of investors from [[Chicago]] and [[New York City|New York]] enamored with the natural beauty, temperate climate, and proximity via rail to the \"snow birds\" of the [[Midwest]], chose an area in eastern St. Martin along and at the mouth of Old Fort Bayou and Bayou Puerto, to build a winter resort. It was called \"Gulf Hills\" because small tributaries and intermittent streams flowing into Old Fort Bayou and Bayou Puerto have dissected the topography in the area.\n\nHarvey W. Braniger (1875\u20131953), a native of [[Morning Sun, Iowa]], and developer of Ivanhoe at Chicago, is generally considered the founder of Gulf Hills. A charter of incorporation was issued for Gulf Hills by the state of Mississippi on September 15, 1925.<ref>''The Jackson County Times'', September 19, 1925, p.&nbsp;2 [http://www.oceanspringsarchives.com/GulfHills.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928111351/http://www.oceanspringsarchives.com/GulfHills.htm |date=2011-09-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe Chicago developers envisioned selling {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} homesites to wealthy northerners who would come to escape winter's cold blasts, then peacefully retire here.\n\nThe Branigars hosted a gala with the early January 1927 opening of Gulf Hills on the No. 1 tee. Billed as the golf city of the Gulf Coast, Gulf Hills covered {{convert|667|acre|km2|1}}, with 249 of them dedicated as fairways, parks, playgrounds and waterways. Of the {{convert|10|mi|0}} of narrow roadways, four of them were waterfront and seven were on the golf course.\n\nThe Depression put the skids to the program. By the end of [[World War II]], there were only 40 homes. By the 1950s, homes were being built again in Gulf Hills. Activity heightened in the 1960s and continued into the 1980s.\n\nThe Gulf Hills Inn was revitalized by renaming it Gulf Hills Dude Ranch and creating a western atmosphere. Gulf Hills became a popular place with nationwide recognition. Stars like [[Judy Garland]], [[Elvis Presley]] and honeymooning [[Mary Ann Mobley]] and [[Gary Collins (actor)|Gary Collins]] adopted the resort as a retreat. Until the 1970s, Mafia bosses would annually gather for business and pleasure. They were so unobtrusive and looked like other golfing businessmen that few people realized they were there.<ref>[http://www.co.jackson.ms.us/GIPages/HistoryPics/JCCommunties/GulfHills.htm]</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the Gulf Hills Hotel and Conference Center and Royal Gulf Hills Golf Club were formed as separate companies that lasted until 2019 when the golf club was sold to a local family. As of the beginning of 2020, Gulf Hills is moving into its next phase with aggressive home building, remodeling, excellent schools, amenities of a growing city, a thriving restaurant and lounge near the hotel, and owners of the resort properties that want to continue with the legacy of its unique beginnings.\n<ref>[https://www.gulfhills.org/gulf-hills-civic-association/#our-history]</ref>\n\nPresently most people live in Gulf Hills year-round, and a diverse group now occupies this once resort community.\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 5,900 people, 2,199 households, and 1,662 families residing in the CDP.

Elevations range from sea level to {{convert|25|ft}} above sea level. The area of interest lies south of the Big Ridge escarpment, on the western terminus of an east-west striking coastal ridge, which is sub-parallel to the Big Ridge. Here small bayous and streams have dissected the topography with steep ravines to create a \"hilly\" terrain. Reconnaissance, surface and geologic investigations indicate that alluvial-fluvial deposits of the Late Pleistocene Prairie Formation are exposed in the higher areas of the Bayou Porteaux-Gulf Hills section.<ref>Otvos, 1972, pp.&nbsp;223\u2013224, [http://www.oceanspringsarchives.com/GulfHills.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928111351/http://www.oceanspringsarchives.com/GulfHills.htm |date=2011-09-28 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\"Bayou Puerto\" is the ancestral name for the area that is now Gulf Hills. This small, isolated, primarily [[Roman Catholic]] settlement came into existence in the mid-19th century, and encompassed for the most part the south half of Section 12, all of Section 13, the east half of Section 14, and the northeast quarter of Section 24, all of T7S-R9W, Jackson County, Mississippi.\n\nThe majority of the people of the Bayou Puerto sector made their livelihoods from the sea and forest. The sea provided fish, crustaceans, and mollusks, as well as the medium for travel and trade. Sylvan dwellers cut timber and light wood and made charcoal. Agriculturally, there were some citrus orchards and viticulture, but large traditional farms were nonexistence. Families cultivated vegetable gardens to supplement their high protein diet consisting primarily of seafood, fowl, and game.\n\nAfter 1900, there was a marked decrease in charcoal making. Virtually every male resident of Bayou Puerto in 1900 was employed in the seafood industry. Only a few Blacks were still producing charcoal, probably for local consumption.<ref>1900 Federal Census, Jackson County, Miss.</ref>\n\n===Slavery===\nSlavery in the Bayou Puerto area was almost nil, as most of the inhabitants existed at the subsistence level.\n\n===Civil War===\nNo [[Union Army|Union]] incursions occurred in the Bayou Puerto section, nor are there any records of Federal occupation here during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Some of the men left the safety and seclusion of their homes to fight for the preservation of [[slavery]] and the [[Confederate States of America]] during the war.\n\n===Millionaires' playground===\n\nAn event which permanently changed the history and culture of Bayou-Puerto and St. Martin occurred as a result of the land boom of the mid-1920s. A group of investors from [[Chicago]] and [[New York City|New York]] enamored with the natural beauty, temperate climate, and proximity via rail to the \"snow birds\" of the [[Midwest]], chose an area in eastern St. Martin along and at the mouth of Old Fort Bayou and Bayou Puerto, to build a winter resort. It was called \"Gulf Hills\" because small tributaries and intermittent streams flowing into Old Fort Bayou and Bayou Puerto have dissected the topography in the area.\n\nHarvey W. Braniger (1875\u20131953), a native of [[Morning Sun, Iowa]], and developer of Ivanhoe at Chicago, is generally considered the founder of Gulf Hills. A charter of incorporation was issued for Gulf Hills by the state of Mississippi on September 15, 1925.<ref>''The Jackson County Times'', September 19, 1925, p.&nbsp;2 [http://www.oceanspringsarchives.com/GulfHills.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928111351/http://www.oceanspringsarchives.com/GulfHills.htm |date=2011-09-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe Chicago developers envisioned selling {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} homesites to wealthy northerners who would come to escape winter's cold blasts, then peacefully retire here.\n\nThe Branigars hosted a gala with the early January 1927 opening of Gulf Hills on the No. 1 tee. Billed as the golf city of the Gulf Coast, Gulf Hills covered {{convert|667|acre|km2|1}}, with 249 of them dedicated as fairways, parks, playgrounds and waterways. Of the {{convert|10|mi|0}} of narrow roadways, four of them were waterfront and seven were on the golf course.\n\nThe Depression put the skids to the program. By the end of [[World War II]], there were only 40 homes. By the 1950s, homes were being built again in Gulf Hills. Activity heightened in the 1960s and continued into the 1980s.\n\nThe Gulf Hills Inn was revitalized by renaming it Gulf Hills Dude Ranch and creating a western atmosphere. Gulf Hills became a popular place with nationwide recognition. Stars like [[Judy Garland]], [[Elvis Presley]] and honeymooning [[Mary Ann Mobley]] and [[Gary Collins (actor)|Gary Collins]] adopted the resort as a retreat. Until the 1970s, Mafia bosses would annually gather for business and pleasure. They were so unobtrusive and looked like other golfing businessmen that few people realized they were there.<ref>[http://www.co.jackson.ms.us/GIPages/HistoryPics/JCCommunties/GulfHills.htm]</ref>\n\nPresently most people live in Gulf Hills year round, and a diverse group now occupies this once resort community.\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 5,900 people, 2,199 households, and 1,662 families residing in the CDP.

Both of these pigments are melanin types, produced inside the hair follicle and packed into granules found in the fibers. [[Eumelanin]] is the dominant pigment in [[brown hair]] and [[black hair]], while [[pheomelanin]] is dominant in [[red hair]]. [[Blond hair]] is the result of having little [[pigmentation]] in the hair strand. [[Gray hair]] occurs when melanin production decreases or stops, while [[poliosis]] is hair (and often the skin to which the hair is attached), typically in spots, that never possessed melanin at all in the first place, or ceased for natural genetic reasons, generally, in the first years of life.\n\n===Human hair growth===\n{{main|Human hair growth}}\nHair grows everywhere on the external body except for mucus membranes and glabrous skin, such as that found on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips.\n\nHair follows a specific growth cycle with three distinct and concurrent phases: [[anagen]], [[catagen]], and [[telogen]] phases; all three occur simultaneously throughout the body. Each has specific characteristics that determine the length of the hair.\n\nThe body has different types of hair, including [[vellus hair]] and [[androgenic hair]], each with its own type of cellular construction. The different construction gives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly, warmth and protection.\n\n===Texture===\n[[File:Natural Afro - hair type 4c- model Gwyneth Ellis.jpg|thumb|Hair type 4c]]\n[[File:OrangeCat hair.jpg|thumb|Orange [[American Shorthair|American shorthair]] cat.]]\nHair exists in a variety of textures. Three main aspects of hair texture are the curl pattern, volume, and consistency. The derivations of hair texture are not fully understood. All mammalian hair is composed of [[keratin]], so the make-up of [[hair follicles]] is not the source of varying hair patterns. There are a range of theories pertaining to the curl patterns of hair. Scientists have come to believe that the shape of the [[hair shaft]] has an effect on the curliness of the individual's hair. A very round shaft allows for fewer [[disulfide bonds]] to be present in the hair strand. This means the bonds present are directly in line with one another, resulting in straight hair.<ref name=\"Davidson genomics\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/genomics/2011/Piper/Background.html |title=Curly Hair Gene |publisher=Bio.davidson.edu |accessdate=28 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501032723/http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/genomics/2011/Piper/Background.html |archive-date=1 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe flatter the hair shaft becomes, the curlier hair gets, because the shape allows more [[cysteine]]s to become compacted together resulting in a bent shape that, with every additional disulfide bond, becomes curlier in form.<ref name=\"Davidson genomics\"/> As the hair follicle shape determines curl pattern, the hair follicle size determines thickness. While the circumference of the hair follicle expands, so does the thickness of the hair follicle. An individual's hair volume, as a result, can be thin, normal, or thick. The consistency of hair can almost always be grouped into three categories: fine, medium, and coarse. This trait is determined by the hair follicle volume and the condition of the strand.<ref name=\"hairdressing.ac.uk 153\">{{cite web |url=http://hairdressing.ac.uk/node/153 |title=Hair type, texture and density &#124; Hairdressing Training |publisher=Hairdressing.ac.uk |accessdate=28 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212010906/http://hairdressing.ac.uk/node/153 |archivedate=12 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Fine hair has the smallest circumference, coarse hair has the largest circumference, and medium hair is anywhere between the other two.<ref name=\"hairdressing.ac.uk 153\"/> Coarse hair has a more open cuticle than thin or medium hair causing it to be the most porous.<ref name=\"hairdressing.ac.uk 153\"/>\n\n===={{anchor|classification}}Classification systems====\nThere are various systems that people use to classify their curl patterns. Being knowledgeable of an individual's hair type is a good start to knowing how to take care of one's hair. There is not just one method to discovering one's hair type. Additionally it is possible, and quite normal to have more than one kind of hair type, for instance having a mixture of both type 3a & 3b curls.\n; {{resize|105%|Andre Walker system}}\n\nThe [[Andre Walker Hair Typing System]] is the most widely used system to classify hair. The system was created by the hairstylist of [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Andre Walker]]. According to this system there are four types of hair: straight, wavy, curly, kinky.\n\n* Type 1 is '''straight hair''', which reflects the most sheen and also the most resilient hair of all of the hair types. It is hard to damage and immensely difficult to curl this hair texture. Because the [[sebum]] easily spreads from the scalp to the ends without curls or kinks to interrupt its path, it is the most oily hair texture of all.\n* Type 2 is '''wavy hair''', whose texture and sheen ranges somewhere between straight and curly hair. Wavy hair is also more likely to become [[frizz]]y than straight hair. While type A waves can easily alternate between straight and curly styles, type B and C Wavy hair is resistant to styling.\n* Type 3 is [[curly hair]] known to have an S-shape. The curl pattern may resemble a lowercase \"s\", uppercase \"S\", or sometimes an uppercase \"Z\" or lowercase \"z\". {{Citation needed|reason=this is suspect (or confusing) because the uppercase \"S\" has the same shape as the lowercase variety|date=September 2016}} This hair type is usually voluminous, \"climate dependent ([[humidity]] = frizz), and damage-prone.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Lack of proper care causes less defined curls.\n* Type 4 is [[kinky hair]], which features a tightly coiled curl pattern (or no discernible curl pattern at all) that is often fragile with a very high density. This type of hair shrinks when wet and because it has fewer cuticle layers than other hair types it is more susceptible to damage.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto 2.0em;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size:105%;padding-bottom:0.2em;\"|Andre Walker hair types\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| Type 1: Straight\n|-\n!style=\"width:3.0em;\"| 1a\n| Straight (Fine/Thin)&nbsp;\n| Hair tends to be very soft, thin, shiny, oily, poor at holding curls, difficult to damage.\n|-\n! 1b\n| Straight (Medium)\n| Hair characterized by volume and body.\n|-\n! 1c\n| Straight (Coarse)\n| Hair tends to be bone-straight, coarse, difficult to curl.\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| Type 2: Wavy\n|-\n! 2a\n| Wavy (Fine/Thin)\n| Hair has definite \"S\" pattern, can easily be straightened or curled, usually receptive to a variety of styles.\n|-\n! 2b\n| Wavy (Medium)\n| Can tend to be frizzy and a little resistant to styling.\n|-\n! 2c\n| Wavy (Coarse)\n| Fairly coarse, frizzy or very frizzy with thicker waves, often more resistant to styling.\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| Type 3: Curly\n|-\n! 3a\n| Curly (Loose)\n| Presents a definite \"S\" pattern, tends to combine thickness, volume, and/or frizziness.\n|-\n! 3b\n| Curly (Tight)\n| Presents a definite \"S\" pattern, curls ranging from spirals to spiral-shaped corkscrew\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| Type 4: Kinky\n|-\n! 4a\n| Kinky (Soft)\n| Hair tends to be very wiry and fragile, tightly coiled and can feature curly patterning.\n|-\n! 4b\n| Kinky (Wiry)\n| As 4a but with less defined pattern of curls, looks more like a \"Z\" with sharp angles\n|-\n|}\n\n; {{resize|105%|FIA system}}\nThis is a method which classifies the hair by curl pattern, hair-strand thickness and overall hair volume.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size:105%;padding-bottom:0.2em;\"|FIA hair classification\n|-\n\n<!---------------------- Curliness ------------------------>\n\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:110%;\"|\nCurliness\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''''Straight'''''\n|-\n!style=\"width:3.0em;\"| 1a\n|colspan=\"2\"| Stick-straight.\n|-\n! 1b\n|colspan=\"2\"| Straight but with a slight body wave adding some volume.\n|-\n! 1c\n|colspan=\"2\"| Straight with body wave and one or two visible S-waves (e.g. at nape of neck or temples).\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''''Wavy'''''\n|-\n! 2a\n|colspan=\"2\"| Loose with stretched S-waves throughout.\n|-\n! 2b\n|colspan=\"2\"| Shorter with more distinct S-waves (resembling e.g. braided damp hair).\n|-\n! 2c\n|colspan=\"2\"| Distinct S-waves, some spiral curling.\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''''Curly'''''\n|-\n! 3a\n|colspan=\"2\"| Big, loose spiral curls.\n|-\n! 3b\n|colspan=\"2\"| Bouncy ringlets.\n|-\n! 3c\n|colspan=\"2\"| Tight corkscrews.\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''''Very''' (\"Really\") '''curly'''''\n|-\n! 4a\n|colspan=\"2\"| Tightly coiled S-curls.\n|-\n! 4b\n|colspan=\"2\"| Z-patterned (tightly coiled, sharply angled)\n|-\n! 4c\n|colspan=\"2\"| Mostly Z-patterned (tightly kinked, less definition)\n|-\n\n<!----------------------- Strands ------------------------->\n\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:110%;\"|\nStrands\n\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n!

Hair provides thermal regulation and [[camouflage]] for many animals; for others it provides signals to other animals such as warnings, mating, or other communicative displays; and for some animals hair provides defensive functions and, rarely, even offensive protection. Hair also has a sensory function, extending the sense of touch beyond the surface of the skin. Guard hairs give warnings that may trigger a recoiling reaction.\n\n===Warmth===\n[[File:Ursus maritimus Steve Amstrup.jpg|thumb|left|Polar bears use their fur for warmth and while their skin is black, their transparent fur appears white and provides camouflage while hunting and serves as protection by hiding cubs in the snow.]]\n\nWhile humans have developed clothing and other means of keeping warm, the hair found on the head serves primarily as a source of heat [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair) as well as protection from ultra-violet radiation exposure. The function of hair in other locations is debated. Hats and coats are still required while doing outdoor activities in cold weather to prevent [[frostbite]] and [[hypothermia]], but the hair on the human body does help to keep the internal temperature regulated. When the body is too cold, the [[arrector pili]] muscles found attached to hair follicles stand up, causing the hair in these follicles to do the same. These hairs then form a heat-trapping layer above the [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]]. This process is formally called [[piloerection]], derived from the Latin words 'pilus' ('hair') and 'erectio' ('rising up'), but is more commonly known as 'having [[goose bumps]]' in English.<ref name=\"Why Do Humans Get goosebumps When They Are Cold, or under Other Circumstances?: Scientific American.\">{{Cite journal|last=Bubenik|first=George A.|date=1 September 2003|title=Why do humans get \"goosebumps\" when they are cold, or under other circumstances?|journal=Scientific American|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-do-humans-get-goosebu|access-date=4 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226210111/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-do-humans-get-goosebu|archive-date=26 December 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> This is more effective in other mammals whose fur fluffs up to create air pockets between hairs that insulate the body from the cold. The opposite actions occur when the body is too warm; the arrector muscles make the hair lie flat on the skin which allows heat to leave.\n\n===Protection===\nIn some mammals, such as [[hedgehog]]s and [[porcupine]]s, the hairs have been modified into hard spines or quills. These are covered with thick plates of keratin and serve as protection against predators. Thick hair such as that of the lion's mane and grizzly bear's fur do offer some protection from physical damages such as bites and scratches.\n\n===Touch sense===\nDisplacement and vibration of hair shafts are detected by hair follicle nerve receptors and nerve receptors within the skin. Hairs can sense movements of air as well as touch by physical objects and they provide sensory awareness of the presence of [[ectoparasites]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2011.0987| pmid = 22171023| title = Human fine body hair enhances ectoparasite detection| journal = Biology Letters| volume = 8| issue = 3| pages = 358\u201361| year = 2011| last1 = Dean | first1 = I.| last2 = Siva-Jothy | first2 = M.

[[Horse]]s and humans are two of the few animals capable of sweating on most of their body, yet horses are larger and still have fully developed fur. In humans, the skin hairs lie flat in hot conditions, as the arrector pili muscles relax, preventing heat from being trapped by a layer of still air between the hairs, and increasing heat loss by [[convection]].\n\nAnother hypothesis for the thick [[body hair]] on humans proposes that [[Fisherian runaway]] [[sexual selection]] played a role (as well as in the selection of long head hair), (see [[#Types of hair|types of hair]] and [[vellus hair]]), as well as a much larger role of testosterone in men. Sexual selection is the only theory thus far that explains the [[sexual dimorphism]] seen in the hair patterns of men and women. On average, men have more [[Androgenic hair|body hair]] than women. Males have more [[terminal hair]], especially on the [[facial hair|face]], [[chest hair|chest]], [[abdominal hair|abdomen]], and back, and females have more [[vellus hair]], which is less visible.

When our ancestors adopted group-dwelling social arrangements roughly 1.8&nbsp;mya, ectoparasite loads increased dramatically. Early humans became the only one of the 193&nbsp;primate species to have [[fleas]], which can be attributed to the close living arrangements of large groups of individuals. While primate species have communal sleeping arrangements, these groups are always on the move and thus are less likely to harbor ectoparasites. Because of this, selection pressure for early humans would favor decreasing body hair because those with thick coats would have more lethal-disease-carrying ectoparasites and would thereby have lower fitness.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAnother view is proposed by [[James Giles (philosopher)|James Giles]], who attempts to explain hairlessness as evolved from the relationship between mother and child, and as a consequence of [[bipedalism]].

While some might argue that, by this logic, humans should also express hairy shoulders because these body parts would putatively be exposed to similar conditions, the protection of the head, the seat of the brain that enabled humanity to become one of the most successful species on the planet (and which also is very vulnerable at birth) was arguably a more urgent issue (axillary hair in the underarms and groin were also retained as signs of sexual maturity). Sometime during the gradual process by which ''Homo erectus'' began a transition from furry skin to the naked skin expressed by Homo sapiens, hair texture putatively gradually changed from straight hair{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} (the condition of most mammals, including humanity's closest cousins\u2014chimpanzees) to [[Afro-textured hair]] or 'kinky' (i.e. tightly coiled). This argument assumes that curly hair better impedes the passage of UV light into the body relative to straight hair (thus curly or coiled hair would be particularly advantageous for light-skinned hominids living at the equator).\n\nIt is substantiated by Iyengar's findings (1998) that UV light can enter into straight human hair roots (and thus into the body through the skin) via the hair shaft. Specifically, the results of that study suggest that this phenomenon resembles the passage of light through fiber optic tubes (which do not function as effectively when kinked or sharply curved or coiled). In this sense, when hominids (i.e. Homo Erectus) were gradually losing their straight body hair and thereby exposing the initially pale skin underneath their fur to the sun, straight hair would have been an adaptive liability.  By inverse logic, later, as humans traveled farther from Africa and/or the equator, straight hair may have (initially) evolved to aid the entry of UV light into the body during the transition from dark, UV-protected skin to paler skin.\n\nSome {{Who|date=August 2016}} conversely believe that tightly coiled hair that grows into a typical Afro-like formation would have greatly reduced the ability of the head and brain to cool because although African people's hair is much less dense than its European counterpart's, in the intense sun the effective 'woolly hat' that such hair produced would have been a disadvantage. However, such anthropologists as [[Nina Jablonski]] oppositely argue about this hair texture. Specifically, Jablonski's assertions<ref name=Jablonski06/>  suggest that the adjective \"woolly\" in reference to Afro-hair is a [[misnomer]] in connoting the high heat insulation derivable from the true wool of sheep. Instead, the relatively sparse density of Afro-hair, combined with its springy coils actually results in an airy, almost sponge-like structure that in turn, Jablonski argues,<ref name=Jablonski06/> more likely facilitates an increase in the circulation of cool air onto the scalp. Further, wet Afro-hair does not stick to the neck and scalp unless totally drenched and instead tends to retain its basic springy puffiness because it less easily responds to moisture and sweat than straight hair does. In this sense, the trait may enhance comfort levels in intense equatorial climates more than straight hair (which, on the other hand, tends to naturally fall over the ears and neck to a degree that provides slightly enhanced comfort levels in cold climates relative to tightly coiled hair).\n\nFurthermore, some {{Who|date=August 2016}} interpret the ideas of [[Charles Darwin]] as suggesting that some traits, such as hair texture, were so arbitrary to human survival that the role natural selection played was trivial. Hence, they argue in favor of his suggestion that sexual selection may be responsible for such traits. However, inclinations towards deeming hair texture \"adaptively trivial\" may root in certain cultural value judgments more than objective logic.  In this sense the possibility that hair ''texture'' may have played an adaptively significant role cannot be completely eliminated from consideration. In fact, while the sexual selection hypothesis cannot be ruled out, the asymmetrical distribution of this trait vouches for environmental influence. Specifically, if hair texture were simply the result of adaptively arbitrary human aesthetic preferences, one would expect that the global distribution of the various hair textures would be fairly random.  Instead, the distribution of Afro-hair is strongly skewed toward the equator.\n\nFurther, it is notable that the most pervasive expression of this hair texture can be found in sub-Saharan Africa; a region of the world that abundant genetic and paleo-anthropological evidence suggests, was the relatively recent (\u2248200,000-year-old) point of origin for modern humanity. In fact, although genetic findings (Tishkoff, 2009) suggest that sub-Saharan Africans are the most genetically diverse continental group on Earth, [[Afro-textured hair]] approaches ubiquity in this region. This points to a strong, long-term selective pressure that, in stark contrast to most other regions of the genomes of sub-Saharan groups, left little room for genetic variation at the determining loci. Such a pattern, again, does not seem to support human sexual aesthetics as being the sole or primary cause of this distribution.\n\n[[File:Blackhair10.jpg|thumb|Straight black hair]]\n\n==== The EDAR locus ====\nA group of studies have recently shown that genetic patterns at the EDAR locus, a region of the modern human genome that contributes to hair texture variation among most individuals of East Asian descent, support the hypothesis that (East Asian) straight hair likely developed in this branch of the modern human lineage subsequent to the original expression of tightly coiled [[natural afro-hair]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18065779|last1=Fujimoto|first1=A|year=2008|pages=835\u201343|issue=6|volume=17|last2=Kimura|first2=R|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|last3=Ohashi|first3=J|last4=Omi|first4=K|last5=Yuliwulandari|first5=R|last6=Batubara|first6=L|last7=Mustofa|first7=MS|last8=Samakkarn|first8=U|last9=Settheetham-Ishida|first9=W|last10=Ishida|first10=T.|last11=Morishita|first11=Y.|last12=Furusawa|first12=T.|last13=Nakazawa|first13=M.|last14=Ohtsuka|first14=R.|last15=Tokunaga|first15=K.|title=A scan for genetic determinants of human hair morphology: EDAR is associated with Asian hair thickness|url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/6/835.full.pdf|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddm355|display-authors=8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18704500|last1=Fujimoto|first1=A|year=2008|pages=179\u201385|issue=2|volume=124|last2=Ohashi|first2=J|journal=Human Genetics|last3=Nishida|first3=N|last4=Miyagawa|first4=T|last5=Morishita|first5=Y|last6=Tsunoda|first6=T|last7=Kimura|first7=R|last8=Tokunaga|first8=K|title=A replication study confirmed the EDAR gene to be a major contributor to population differentiation regarding head hair thickness in Asia|url=http://www.tulips.tsukuba.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2241/103672/1/HG_124-2.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00439-008-0537-1|access-date=14 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205011119/http://www.tulips.tsukuba.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2241/103672/1/HG_124-2.pdf|archive-date=5 February 2011|url-status=live|hdl=2241/103672}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mou|first1=C|last2=Thomason|first2=HA|last3=Willan|first3=PM|last4=Clowes|first4=C|last5=Harris|first5=WE|last6=Drew|first6=CF|last7=Dixon|first7=J|last8=Dixon|first8=MJ|last9=Headon|first9=DJ|title=Enhanced ectodysplasin-A receptor (EDAR) signaling alters multiple fiber characteristics to produce the East Asian hair form|journal=Human Mutation|volume=29|issue=12|pages=1405\u201311|year=2008|pmid=18561327|doi=10.1002/humu.20795|url=https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/8264337/Mou_et_al_EDAR_and_Asian_Hair_2008_supplementary_material.pdf|access-date=30 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417232100/https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/8264337/Mou_et_al_EDAR_and_Asian_Hair_2008_supplementary_material.pdf|archive-date=17 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Specifically, the relevant findings indicate that the EDAR mutation coding for the predominant East Asian 'coarse' or thick, straight hair texture arose within the past \u224865,000 years, which is a time frame that covers from the earliest of the 'Out of Africa' migrations up to now.\n\n==Disease==\n{{See also|Hair diseases|}}\n[[Tinea corporis|Ringworm]] is a [[mycosis|fungal disease]] that targets hairy skin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dermatologyinfo.net/english/chapters/chapter10.htm |title=Dermatologyinfo.net |publisher=Dermatologyinfo.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205201/http://www.dermatologyinfo.net/english/chapters/chapter10.htm |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Premature greying of hair]] is another condition that results in greying before the age of 20 years in Whites, before 25 years in Asians, and before 30 years in Africans.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2013;volume=79;issue=5;spage=641;epage=653;aulast=Pandhi#ref4 |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816003234/http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2013;volume=79;issue=5;spage=641;epage=653;aulast=Pandhi#ref4 |archive-date=16 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Hair care ==\n{{Main|Hair care}}\nHair care involves the [[hygiene]] and [[cosmetology]] of hair including hair on the [[scalp]], facial hair ([[beard]] and [[moustache]]), [[pubic hair]] and other body hair. Hair care routines differ according to an individual's culture and the physical characteristics of one's hair. Hair may be colored, trimmed, shaved, plucked, or otherwise removed with treatments such as waxing, sugaring, and threading.\n\n===Removal practices===\n[[Depilation]] is the removal of hair from the surface of the skin. This can be achieved through methods such as [[shaving]]. [[Epilation]] is the removal of the entire hair strand, including the part of the hair that has not yet left the follicle. A popular way to epilate hair is through [[waxing]].\n\n====Shaving====\n[[File:Shaving-system-2blade.jpg|thumb|Many razors have multiple blades purportedly to ensure a close shave. While shaving initially will leave skin feeling smooth and hair free, new hair growth can appear a few hours after hair removal.]]\n[[Shaving]] is accomplished with bladed instruments, such as [[razors]]. The [[blade]] is brought close to the skin and stroked over the hair in the desired area to cut the terminal hairs and leave the skin feeling smooth. Depending upon the rate of growth, one can begin to feel the hair growing back within hours of shaving. This is especially evident in men who develop a [[five o'clock shadow]] after having shaved their faces. This new growth is called [[Shaving|stubble]]. Stubble typically appears to grow back thicker because the shaved hairs are blunted instead of tapered off at the end, although the hair never actually grows back thicker.\n\n====Waxing====\n[[Waxing]] involves using a sticky wax and strip of paper or cloth to pull hair from the root. Waxing is the ideal hair removal technique to keep an area hair-free for long periods of time. It can take three to five weeks for waxed hair to begin to resurface again. Hair in areas that have been waxed consistently is known to grow back finer and thinner, especially compared to hair that has been shaved with a razor.\n\n====Laser removal====\n{{main|Laser hair removal}}\n\nLaser hair removal is a cosmetic method where a small [[laser]] beam pulses selective heat on dark target matter in the area that causes hair growth without harming the skin tissue.  This process is repeated several times over the course of many months to a couple of years with hair regrowing less frequently until it finally stops; this is used as a more permanent solution to [[waxing]] or [[shaving]].  Laser removal is practiced in many clinics along with many at-home products.\n\n====Cutting and trimming====\n{{see also|Ponytail}}\n\nBecause the hair on one's head is normally longer than other types of body hair, it is cut with [[scissors]] or [[Manual hair clippers|clippers]]. People with longer hair will most often use scissors to cut their hair, whereas shorter hair is maintained using a trimmer. Depending on the desired length and overall health of the hair, periods without cutting or trimming the hair can vary.\n\nCut hair may be used in [[wig]]s. Global imports of hair in 2010 was worth $US 1.24 billion.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=Ankush|title=Human Hair \"Waste\" and Its Utilization: Gaps and Possibilities|journal=Journal of Waste Management|date=27 April 2014|doi=10.1155/2014/498018|volume=2014|pages=1\u201317|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Social role==\n{{See also|Hairstyle}}\n[[File:Alessandro Allori - Portrait of Bianca Cappello.jpg|thumb|right|''Portrait of a Woman,'' Alessandro Allori (1535\u20131607; [[Uffizi Gallery]]): a plucked hairline gives a fashionably \"noble brow\"]]\nHair has great social significance for [[human being]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.42.6 | issue=42 | title=Archaeologies of Hair: the head and its grooming in ancient and contemporary societies | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Ashby | first1 = Steven P.| doi-access=free }}</ref> \n<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.42.6.13 | issue=42 | title=Because You're Worth It: Women's daily hair care routines in contemporary Britain | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Hielscher | first1 = Sabine | doi-access=free }}</ref> It can grow on most external areas of the [[human body]], except on the palms of the [[hand]]s and the soles of the feet (among other areas).

These include the [[face]], [[ear]]s, [[human head|head]], eyebrows, [[human leg|leg]]s, and [[armpit]]s, as well as the [[pubic region]]. The highly visible differences between male and female body and facial hair are a notable [[secondary sex characteristic]].\n\nThe world's longest documented hair belongs to Xie Qiuping (China), at 5.627 m (18&nbsp;ft 5.54 in) when measured on 8 May 2004.

Hair color and texture can be a sign of ethnic ancestry. [[Facial hair]] is a sign of [[puberty]] in men. White hair is a sign of age or genetics, which may be concealed with [[Hair coloring|hair dye]] (not easily for some), although many prefer to assume it (especially if it is a [[poliosis]] characteristic of the person since childhood). Male pattern [[baldness]] is a sign of age, which may be concealed with a [[toupee]], hats, or religious and cultural adornments. Although drugs and medical procedures exist for the treatment of baldness, many balding men simply shave their heads. In early modern China, the queue was a male hairstyle worn by the Manchus from central Manchuria and the Han Chinese during the Qing dynasty; hair on the front of the head was shaved off above the temples every ten days, mimicking male-pattern baldness,  and the rest of the hair braided into a long pigtail.\n\n[[Hairstyle]] may be an indicator of group membership. During the [[English Civil War]], the followers of [[Oliver Cromwell]] decided to crop their hair close to their head, as an act of defiance to the curls and ringlets of the king's men.<ref>Olmert, Michael (1996).

Female art students known as the \"cropheads\" also adopted the style, notably at the Slade School in London, England. Regional variations in [[hirsutism]] cause practices regarding hair on the arms and legs to differ. Some religious groups may follow certain rules regarding hair as part of religious observance. The rules often differ for men and women.\n\nMany subcultures have hairstyles which may indicate an unofficial membership. Many [[hippie]]s, [[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]], and Indian [[sadhus]] have [[long hair]], as well many older [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|indie kids]]. Many [[punk fashion|punks]] wear a hairstyle known as a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] or other spiked and dyed hairstyles; [[skinhead]]s have short-cropped or completely shaved heads. Long stylized bangs were very common for [[Emo (stereotype)|emo]]s, [[Scene (subculture)|scene kids]] and younger [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|indie kids]] in the 2000s and early 2010s, among people of both [[gender]]s.\n\nHeads were shaved in [[concentration camp]]s, and head-shaving has been used as [[punishment]], especially for women with long hair. The shaven head is common in [[military]] haircuts, while Western monks are known for the [[tonsure]]. By contrast, among some Indian holy men, the hair is worn extremely long.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn the time of Confucius (5th century BCE), the Chinese grew out their hair and often tied it, as a symbol of filial piety.\n\nRegular hairdressing in some cultures is considered a sign of wealth or status. The [[dreadlocks]] of the [[Rastafari movement]] were despised early in the movement's history. In some cultures, having one's hair cut can symbolize a liberation from one's past, usually after a trying time in one's life. Cutting the hair also may be a sign of mourning.\n\nTightly coiled hair in its natural state may be worn in an [[Afro]]. This hairstyle was once worn among [[African American]]s as a symbol of racial pride. Given that the coiled texture is the natural state of some African Americans' hair, or perceived as being more \"African\", this simple style is now often seen as a sign of self-acceptance and an affirmation that the beauty norms of the ([[Eurocentrism|eurocentric]]) dominant culture are not absolute. It is important to note that African Americans as a whole have a variety of hair textures, as they are not an ethnically homogeneous group, but an ad-hoc of different racial admixtures.\n\nThe film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) includes the assumption that the two main characters could have their long hairs forcibly shaved with a rusty razor when jailed, symbolizing the intolerance of some conservative groups toward members of the [[counterculture]]. At the conclusion of the [[Oz trial|Oz obscenity trials in the UK in 1971]], the defendants had their heads shaved by the police, causing public outcry. During the appeal trial, they appeared in the dock wearing wigs.<ref>[[Jonathon Green|Green, Jonathon]], (1999). ''All Dressed Up: The Sixties and the Counterculture''.

[[Russian Orthodox Church]] requires all married women to wear headscarves inside the church; this tradition is often extended to all women, regardless of marital status. [[Orthodox Judaism]] also commands the use of scarves and other head coverings for married women for modesty reasons. Certain [[Hindu]] sects also wear head scarves for religious reasons. [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] have an obligation not to cut hair (a Sikh cutting hair becomes 'apostate' which means fallen from religion)<ref>Dilgeer, Harjinder Singh (2005) ''Dictionary of Sikh Philosophy'', Sikh University Press.</ref> and men keep it tied in a bun on the head, which is then covered appropriately using a [[turban]]. Multiple religions, both ancient and contemporary, require or advise one to allow their hair to become [[dreadlocks]], though people also wear them for fashion. For men, Islam, Orthodox Judaism, Orthodox Christianity, Roman Catholicism, and other religious groups have at various times recommended or required the covering of the head and sections of the hair of men, and some have dictates relating to the cutting of men's facial and head hair. Some Christian sects throughout history and up to modern times have also religiously proscribed the cutting of women's hair. For some [[Sunni]] [[madhab]]s, the donning of a [[kufi]] or [[Taqiyah (cap)|topi]] is a form of [[sunnah]].<ref>The War Within Our Hearts \u2013 Page 65 Sa'ad Quadri \u2013 2013</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col}}\n* [[Chaetophobia]] \u2013 the fear of hair\n* [[Hair analysis (alternative medicine)]]\n* [[Hypertrichosis]] \u2013 the state of having an excess of hair on the head or body\n* [[Hypotrichosis]] \u2013 the state of having a less than normal amount of hair on the head or body\n* [[Lanugo]]\n* [[Seta]] \u2013 hair-like structures in insects\n* [[Trichotillomania]] \u2013 hair pulling\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite journal |ref=Iyengar1998 |last=Iyengar |first=B. |year=1998 |title=The hair follicle is a specialized UV receptor in human skin? |journal=Bio Signals Recep |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=188\u2013194 |doi=10.1159/000014544 |pmid=9672761 }}\n* {{cite book |ref=Jablonski2006 |last=Jablonski |first=N.G. |year=2006 |title=Skin: a natural history |url=https://archive.org/details/skinnaturalhisto00jabl |url-access=registration |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=University of California Press}}\n* {{cite journal |ref=Rogers2004 |last1=Rogers |first1=Alan R. |last2=Iltis |first2=David |last3=Wooding |first3=Stephen |year=2004 |title=Genetic variation at the MC1R locus and the time since loss of human body hair |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=105\u2013108 |doi=10.1086/381006 }}\n* {{cite journal |ref=Tishkoff1996 |last=Tishkoff |first=S.

Its complex structure slides as the hair swells and is covered with a single molecular layer of lipid that makes the hair repel water.<ref name=\"Hair Structure and Hair Life Cycle\"/> The diameter of human hair varies from {{convert|0.017|to|0.18|mm|sp=us|lk=in }}.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ley |first=Brian |title=Diameter of a Human Hair |year=1999 |url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/BrianLey.shtml |accessdate=28 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330150127/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/BrianLey.shtml |archivedate=30 March 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> There are two million small, tubular glands and [[sweat gland]]s that produce watery fluids that cool the body by evaporation.

Both of these pigments are melanin types, produced inside the hair follicle and packed into granules found in the fibers. [[Eumelanin]] is the dominant pigment in [[brown hair]] and [[black hair]], while [[pheomelanin]] is dominant in [[red hair]]. [[Blond hair]] is the result of having little [[pigmentation]] in the hair strand. [[Gray hair]] occurs when melanin production decreases or stops, while [[poliosis]] is hair (and often the skin to which the hair is attached), typically in spots, that never possessed melanin at all in the first place, or ceased for natural genetic reasons, generally, in the first years of life.\n\n===Human hair growth===\n{{main|Human hair growth}}\nHair grows everywhere on the external body except for mucus membranes and glabrous skin, such as that found on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips.\n\nHair follows a specific growth cycle with three distinct and concurrent phases: [[anagen]], [[catagen]], and [[telogen]] phases; all three occur simultaneously throughout the body. Each has specific characteristics that determine the length of the hair.\n\nThe body has different types of hair, including [[vellus hair]] and [[androgenic hair]], each with its own type of cellular construction. The different construction gives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly, warmth and protection.\n\n===Texture===\n[[File:Natural Afro - hair type 4c- model Gwyneth Ellis.jpg|thumb|Hair type 4c]]\n[[File:OrangeCat hair.jpg|thumb|Orange [[American Shorthair|American shorthair]] cat.]]\nHair exists in a variety of textures. Three main aspects of hair texture are the curl pattern, volume, and consistency. The derivations of hair texture are not fully understood. All mammalian hair is composed of [[keratin]], so the make-up of [[hair follicles]] is not the source of varying hair patterns. There are a range of theories pertaining to the curl patterns of hair. Scientists have come to believe that the shape of the [[hair shaft]] has an effect on the curliness of the individual's hair. A very round shaft allows for fewer [[disulfide bonds]] to be present in the hair strand. This means the bonds present are directly in line with one another, resulting in straight hair.<ref name=\"Davidson genomics\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/genomics/2011/Piper/Background.html |title=Curly Hair Gene |publisher=Bio.davidson.edu |accessdate=28 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501032723/http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/genomics/2011/Piper/Background.html |archive-date=1 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe flatter the hair shaft becomes, the curlier hair gets, because the shape allows more [[cysteine]]s to become compacted together resulting in a bent shape that, with every additional disulfide bond, becomes curlier in form.<ref name=\"Davidson genomics\"/> As the hair follicle shape determines curl pattern, the hair follicle size determines thickness. While the circumference of the hair follicle expands, so does the thickness of the hair follicle. An individual's hair volume, as a result, can be thin, normal, or thick. The consistency of hair can almost always be grouped into three categories: fine, medium, and coarse. This trait is determined by the hair follicle volume and the condition of the strand.<ref name=\"hairdressing.ac.uk 153\">{{cite web |url=http://hairdressing.ac.uk/node/153 |title=Hair type, texture and density &#124; Hairdressing Training |publisher=Hairdressing.ac.uk |accessdate=28 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212010906/http://hairdressing.ac.uk/node/153 |archivedate=12 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Fine hair has the smallest circumference, coarse hair has the largest circumference, and medium hair is anywhere between the other two.<ref name=\"hairdressing.ac.uk 153\"/> Coarse hair has a more open cuticle than thin or medium hair causing it to be the most porous.<ref name=\"hairdressing.ac.uk 153\"/>\n\n===={{anchor|classification}}Classification systems====\nThere are various systems that people use to classify their curl patterns. Being knowledgeable of an individual's hair type is a good start to knowing how to take care of one's hair. There is not just one method to discovering one's hair type. Additionally it is possible, and quite normal to have more than one kind of hair type, for instance having a mixture of both type 3a & 3b curls.\n; {{resize|105%|Andre Walker system}}\n\nThe [[Andre Walker Hair Typing System]] is the most widely used system to classify hair. The system was created by the hairstylist of [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Andre Walker]]. According to this system there are four types of hair: straight, wavy, curly, kinky.\n\n* Type 1 is '''straight hair''', which reflects the most sheen and also the most resilient hair of all of the hair types. It is hard to damage and immensely difficult to curl this hair texture. Because the [[sebum]] easily spreads from the scalp to the ends without curls or kinks to interrupt its path, it is the most oily hair texture of all.\n* Type 2 is '''wavy hair''', whose texture and sheen ranges somewhere between straight and curly hair. Wavy hair is also more likely to become [[frizz]]y than straight hair. While type A waves can easily alternate between straight and curly styles, type B and C Wavy hair is resistant to styling.\n* Type 3 is [[curly hair]] known to have an S-shape. The curl pattern may resemble a lowercase \"s\", uppercase \"S\", or sometimes an uppercase \"Z\" or lowercase \"z\". {{Citation needed|reason=this is suspect (or confusing) because the uppercase \"S\" has the same shape as the lowercase variety|date=September 2016}} This hair type is usually voluminous, \"climate dependent ([[humidity]] = frizz), and damage-prone.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Lack of proper care causes less defined curls.\n* Type 4 is [[kinky hair]], which features a tightly coiled curl pattern (or no discernible curl pattern at all) that is often fragile with a very high density. This type of hair shrinks when wet and because it has fewer cuticle layers than other hair types it is more susceptible to damage.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto 2.0em;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size:105%;padding-bottom:0.2em;\"|Andre Walker hair types\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| Type 1: Straight\n|-\n!style=\"width:3.0em;\"| 1a\n| Straight (Fine/Thin)&nbsp;\n| Hair tends to be very soft, thin, shiny, oily, poor at holding curls, difficult to damage.\n|-\n! 1b\n| Straight (Medium)\n| Hair characterized by volume and body.\n|-\n! 1c\n| Straight (Coarse)\n| Hair tends to be bone-straight, coarse, difficult to curl.\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| Type 2: Wavy\n|-\n! 2a\n| Wavy (Fine/Thin)\n| Hair has definite \"S\" pattern, can easily be straightened or curled, usually receptive to a variety of styles.\n|-\n! 2b\n| Wavy (Medium)\n| Can tend to be frizzy and a little resistant to styling.\n|-\n! 2c\n| Wavy (Coarse)\n| Fairly coarse, frizzy or very frizzy with thicker waves, often more resistant to styling.\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| Type 3: Curly\n|-\n! 3a\n| Curly (Loose)\n| Presents a definite \"S\" pattern, tends to combine thickness, volume, and/or frizziness.\n|-\n! 3b\n| Curly (Tight)\n| Presents a definite \"S\" pattern, curls ranging from spirals to spiral-shaped corkscrew\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| Type 4: Kinky\n|-\n! 4a\n| Kinky (Soft)\n| Hair tends to be very wiry and fragile, tightly coiled and can feature curly patterning.\n|-\n! 4b\n| Kinky (Wiry)\n| As 4a but with less defined pattern of curls, looks more like a \"Z\" with sharp angles\n|-\n|}\n\n; {{resize|105%|FIA system}}\nThis is a method which classifies the hair by curl pattern, hair-strand thickness and overall hair volume.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size:105%;padding-bottom:0.2em;\"|FIA hair classification\n|-\n\n<!---------------------- Curliness ------------------------>\n\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:110%;\"|\nCurliness\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''''Straight'''''\n|-\n!style=\"width:3.0em;\"| 1a\n|colspan=\"2\"| Stick-straight.\n|-\n! 1b\n|colspan=\"2\"| Straight but with a slight body wave adding some volume.\n|-\n! 1c\n|colspan=\"2\"| Straight with body wave and one or two visible S-waves (e.g. at nape of neck or temples).\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''''Wavy'''''\n|-\n! 2a\n|colspan=\"2\"| Loose with stretched S-waves throughout.\n|-\n! 2b\n|colspan=\"2\"| Shorter with more distinct S-waves (resembling e.g. braided damp hair).\n|-\n! 2c\n|colspan=\"2\"| Distinct S-waves, some spiral curling.\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''''Curly'''''\n|-\n! 3a\n|colspan=\"2\"| Big, loose spiral curls.\n|-\n! 3b\n|colspan=\"2\"| Bouncy ringlets.\n|-\n! 3c\n|colspan=\"2\"| Tight corkscrews.\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''''Very''' (\"Really\") '''curly'''''\n|-\n! 4a\n|colspan=\"2\"| Tightly coiled S-curls.\n|-\n! 4b\n|colspan=\"2\"| Z-patterned (tightly coiled, sharply angled)\n|-\n! 4c\n|colspan=\"2\"| Mostly Z-patterned (tightly kinked, less definition)\n|-\n\n<!----------------------- Strands ------------------------->\n\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:110%;\"|\nStrands\n\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n!

Hair provides thermal regulation and [[camouflage]] for many animals; for others it provides signals to other animals such as warnings, mating, or other communicative displays; and for some animals hair provides defensive functions and, rarely, even offensive protection. Hair also has a sensory function, extending the sense of touch beyond the surface of the skin. Guard hairs give warnings that may trigger a recoiling reaction.\n\n===Warmth===\n[[File:Ursus maritimus Steve Amstrup.jpg|thumb|left|Polar bears use their fur for warmth and while their skin is black, their transparent fur appears white and provides camouflage while hunting and serves as protection by hiding cubs in the snow.]]\n\nWhile humans have developed clothing and other means of keeping warm, the hair found on the head serves primarily as a source of heat [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] and cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair) as well as protection from ultra-violet radiation exposure. The function of hair in other locations is debated. Hats and coats are still required while doing outdoor activities in cold weather to prevent [[frostbite]] and [[hypothermia]], but the hair on the human body does help to keep the internal temperature regulated. When the body is too cold, the [[arrector pili]] muscles found attached to hair follicles stand up, causing the hair in these follicles to do the same. These hairs then form a heat-trapping layer above the [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]]. This process is formally called [[piloerection]], derived from the Latin words 'pilus' ('hair') and 'erectio' ('rising up'), but is more commonly known as 'having [[goose bumps]]' in English.<ref name=\"Why Do Humans Get goosebumps When They Are Cold, or under Other Circumstances?: Scientific American.\">{{Cite journal|last=Bubenik|first=George A.|date=1 September 2003|title=Why do humans get \"goosebumps\" when they are cold, or under other circumstances?|journal=Scientific American|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-do-humans-get-goosebu|access-date=4 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226210111/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-do-humans-get-goosebu|archive-date=26 December 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> This is more effective in other mammals whose fur fluffs up to create air pockets between hairs that insulate the body from the cold. The opposite actions occur when the body is too warm; the arrector muscles make the hair lie flat on the skin which allows heat to leave.\n\n===Protection===\nIn some mammals, such as [[hedgehog]]s and [[porcupine]]s, the hairs have been modified into hard spines or quills. These are covered with thick plates of keratin and serve as protection against predators. Thick hair such as that of the lion's mane and grizzly bear's fur do offer some protection from physical damages such as bites and scratches.\n\n===Touch sense===\nDisplacement and vibration of hair shafts are detected by hair follicle nerve receptors and nerve receptors within the skin. Hairs can sense movements of air as well as touch by physical objects and they provide sensory awareness of the presence of [[ectoparasites]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2011.0987| pmid = 22171023| title = Human fine body hair enhances ectoparasite detection| journal = Biology Letters| volume = 8| issue = 3| pages = 358\u201361| year = 2011| last1 = Dean | first1 = I.| last2 = Siva-Jothy | first2 = M.

This suggests that humans had lost body hair (but retained head hair) and developed thick pubic hair prior to this date, were living in or close to the forest where gorillas lived, and acquired pubic lice from butchering gorillas or sleeping in their nests.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070316-gorilla-lice.html |title=Gorillas gave pubic lice to humans, DNA study reveals |work=National Geographic |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=18 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216214857/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/03/070316-gorilla-lice.html |archive-date=16 December 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Biol |date=10 February 2009 |volume=8 |issue=2 |page=20 |title=Apes, lice and prehistory |author=Weiss RA |pmid=19232074 |pmc=2687769 |doi=10.1186/jbiol114}}</ref>\nThe evolution of the [[body louse]] from the head louse, on the other hand, places the date of clothing much later, some 100,000&nbsp;years ago.<ref name=\"Stoneking\">{{Cite journal |last1=Kittler |first1=R. |last2=Kayser |first2=M. |last3=Stoneking |first3=M. |year=2004 |title=Molecular Evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the Origin of Clothing |journal=Current Biology |volume=14 |issue=24 |page=2309 |access-date=4 September 2015 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.024 |url=http://www.beha.tcu.edu.tw/migration/ref/Kittler_et_al_2003_Current_Biology_Molecular_evolution_of_Pediculus_humanus_and_the_origin_of_clothing.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304125056/http://www.beha.tcu.edu.tw/migration/ref/Kittler_et_al_2003_Current_Biology_Molecular_evolution_of_Pediculus_humanus_and_the_origin_of_clothing.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Toups |first1=M.A. |last2=Kitchen |first2=A. |last3=Light |first3=J.E. |last4=Reed |first4=D.L. |year=2011 |title=Origin of clothing lice indicates early clothing use by anatomically modern humans in Africa |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=29\u201332 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msq234 |pmc=3002236 |pmid=20823373}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vulpes vulpes sitting.jpg|thumb|The soft, fine hair found on many nonhuman mammals is typically called fur.<!-- moved ref to main text, above: name=Bergman2014 -->]]\nThe sweat glands in humans could have evolved to spread from the hands and feet as the body hair changed, or the hair change could have occurred to facilitate sweating. [[Horse]]s and humans are two of the few animals capable of sweating on most of their body, yet horses are larger and still have fully developed fur. In humans, the skin hairs lie flat in hot conditions, as the arrector pili muscles relax, preventing heat from being trapped by a layer of still air between the hairs, and increasing heat loss by [[convection]].\n\nAnother hypothesis for the thick [[body hair]] on humans proposes that [[Fisherian runaway]] [[sexual selection]] played a role (as well as in the selection of long head hair), (see [[#Types of hair|types of hair]] and [[vellus hair]]), as well as a much larger role of testosterone in men. Sexual selection is the only theory thus far that explains the [[sexual dimorphism]] seen in the hair patterns of men and women. On average, men have more [[Androgenic hair|body hair]] than women. Males have more [[terminal hair]], especially on the [[facial hair|face]], [[chest hair|chest]], [[abdominal hair|abdomen]], and back, and females have more [[vellus hair]], which is less visible. The halting of hair development at a juvenile stage, vellus hair, would also be consistent with the [[neoteny]] evident in humans, especially in females, and thus they could have occurred at the same time.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dixson |first=A.F. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRTniKE2liYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Sexual selection and the origins of human mating systems |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417232112/https://books.google.com/books?id=VRTniKE2liYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-date=17 April 2019 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |edition=1 |year=2009 |ISBN=0-19-955942-2}}</ref> This theory, however, has significant holdings in today's cultural norms.

When our ancestors adopted group-dwelling social arrangements roughly 1.8&nbsp;mya, ectoparasite loads increased dramatically. Early humans became the only one of the 193&nbsp;primate species to have [[fleas]], which can be attributed to the close living arrangements of large groups of individuals. While primate species have communal sleeping arrangements, these groups are always on the move and thus are less likely to harbor ectoparasites. Because of this, selection pressure for early humans would favor decreasing body hair because those with thick coats would have more lethal-disease-carrying ectoparasites and would thereby have lower fitness.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAnother view is proposed by [[James Giles (philosopher)|James Giles]], who attempts to explain hairlessness as evolved from the relationship between mother and child, and as a consequence of [[bipedalism]].

While some might argue that, by this logic, humans should also express hairy shoulders because these body parts would putatively be exposed to similar conditions, the protection of the head, the seat of the brain that enabled humanity to become one of the most successful species on the planet (and which also is very vulnerable at birth) was arguably a more urgent issue (axillary hair in the underarms and groin were also retained as signs of sexual maturity). Sometime during the gradual process by which ''Homo erectus'' began a transition from furry skin to the naked skin expressed by Homo sapiens, hair texture putatively gradually changed from straight hair{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} (the condition of most mammals, including humanity's closest cousins\u2014chimpanzees) to [[Afro-textured hair]] or 'kinky' (i.e. tightly coiled). This argument assumes that curly hair better impedes the passage of UV light into the body relative to straight hair (thus curly or coiled hair would be particularly advantageous for light-skinned hominids living at the equator).\n\nIt is substantiated by Iyengar's findings (1998) that UV light can enter into straight human hair roots (and thus into the body through the skin) via the hair shaft. Specifically, the results of that study suggest that this phenomenon resembles the passage of light through fiber optic tubes (which do not function as effectively when kinked or sharply curved or coiled). In this sense, when hominids (i.e. Homo Erectus) were gradually losing their straight body hair and thereby exposing the initially pale skin underneath their fur to the sun, straight hair would have been an adaptive liability.  By inverse logic, later, as humans traveled farther from Africa and/or the equator, straight hair may have (initially) evolved to aid the entry of UV light into the body during the transition from dark, UV-protected skin to paler skin.\n\nSome {{Who|date=August 2016}} conversely believe that tightly coiled hair that grows into a typical Afro-like formation would have greatly reduced the ability of the head and brain to cool because although African people's hair is much less dense than its European counterpart's, in the intense sun the effective 'woolly hat' that such hair produced would have been a disadvantage. However, such anthropologists as [[Nina Jablonski]] oppositely argue about this hair texture. Specifically, Jablonski's assertions<ref name=Jablonski06/>  suggest that the adjective \"woolly\" in reference to Afro-hair is a [[misnomer]] in connoting the high heat insulation derivable from the true wool of sheep. Instead, the relatively sparse density of Afro-hair, combined with its springy coils actually results in an airy, almost sponge-like structure that in turn, Jablonski argues,<ref name=Jablonski06/> more likely facilitates an increase in the circulation of cool air onto the scalp. Further, wet Afro-hair does not stick to the neck and scalp unless totally drenched and instead tends to retain its basic springy puffiness because it less easily responds to moisture and sweat than straight hair does. In this sense, the trait may enhance comfort levels in intense equatorial climates more than straight hair (which, on the other hand, tends to naturally fall over the ears and neck to a degree that provides slightly enhanced comfort levels in cold climates relative to tightly coiled hair).\n\nFurthermore, some {{Who|date=August 2016}} interpret the ideas of [[Charles Darwin]] as suggesting that some traits, such as hair texture, were so arbitrary to human survival that the role natural selection played was trivial. Hence, they argue in favor of his suggestion that sexual selection may be responsible for such traits. However, inclinations towards deeming hair texture \"adaptively trivial\" may root in certain cultural value judgments more than objective logic.  In this sense the possibility that hair ''texture'' may have played an adaptively significant role cannot be completely eliminated from consideration. In fact, while the sexual selection hypothesis cannot be ruled out, the asymmetrical distribution of this trait vouches for environmental influence. Specifically, if hair texture were simply the result of adaptively arbitrary human aesthetic preferences, one would expect that the global distribution of the various hair textures would be fairly random.  Instead, the distribution of Afro-hair is strongly skewed toward the equator.\n\nFurther, it is notable that the most pervasive expression of this hair texture can be found in sub-Saharan Africa; a region of the world that abundant genetic and paleo-anthropological evidence suggests, was the relatively recent (\u2248200,000-year-old) point of origin for modern humanity. In fact, although genetic findings (Tishkoff, 2009) suggest that sub-Saharan Africans are the most genetically diverse continental group on Earth, [[Afro-textured hair]] approaches ubiquity in this region. This points to a strong, long-term selective pressure that, in stark contrast to most other regions of the genomes of sub-Saharan groups, left little room for genetic variation at the determining loci. Such a pattern, again, does not seem to support human sexual aesthetics as being the sole or primary cause of this distribution.\n\n[[File:Blackhair10.jpg|thumb|Straight black hair]]\n\n==== The EDAR locus ====\nA group of studies have recently shown that genetic patterns at the EDAR locus, a region of the modern human genome that contributes to hair texture variation among most individuals of East Asian descent, support the hypothesis that (East Asian) straight hair likely developed in this branch of the modern human lineage subsequent to the original expression of tightly coiled [[natural afro-hair]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18065779|last1=Fujimoto|first1=A|year=2008|pages=835\u201343|issue=6|volume=17|last2=Kimura|first2=R|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|last3=Ohashi|first3=J|last4=Omi|first4=K|last5=Yuliwulandari|first5=R|last6=Batubara|first6=L|last7=Mustofa|first7=MS|last8=Samakkarn|first8=U|last9=Settheetham-Ishida|first9=W|last10=Ishida|first10=T.|last11=Morishita|first11=Y.|last12=Furusawa|first12=T.|last13=Nakazawa|first13=M.|last14=Ohtsuka|first14=R.|last15=Tokunaga|first15=K.|title=A scan for genetic determinants of human hair morphology: EDAR is associated with Asian hair thickness|url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/6/835.full.pdf|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddm355|display-authors=8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=18704500|last1=Fujimoto|first1=A|year=2008|pages=179\u201385|issue=2|volume=124|last2=Ohashi|first2=J|journal=Human Genetics|last3=Nishida|first3=N|last4=Miyagawa|first4=T|last5=Morishita|first5=Y|last6=Tsunoda|first6=T|last7=Kimura|first7=R|last8=Tokunaga|first8=K|title=A replication study confirmed the EDAR gene to be a major contributor to population differentiation regarding head hair thickness in Asia|url=http://www.tulips.tsukuba.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2241/103672/1/HG_124-2.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00439-008-0537-1|access-date=14 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205011119/http://www.tulips.tsukuba.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2241/103672/1/HG_124-2.pdf|archive-date=5 February 2011|url-status=live|hdl=2241/103672}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mou|first1=C|last2=Thomason|first2=HA|last3=Willan|first3=PM|last4=Clowes|first4=C|last5=Harris|first5=WE|last6=Drew|first6=CF|last7=Dixon|first7=J|last8=Dixon|first8=MJ|last9=Headon|first9=DJ|title=Enhanced ectodysplasin-A receptor (EDAR) signaling alters multiple fiber characteristics to produce the East Asian hair form|journal=Human Mutation|volume=29|issue=12|pages=1405\u201311|year=2008|pmid=18561327|doi=10.1002/humu.20795|url=https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/8264337/Mou_et_al_EDAR_and_Asian_Hair_2008_supplementary_material.pdf|access-date=30 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417232100/https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/8264337/Mou_et_al_EDAR_and_Asian_Hair_2008_supplementary_material.pdf|archive-date=17 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Specifically, the relevant findings indicate that the EDAR mutation coding for the predominant East Asian 'coarse' or thick, straight hair texture arose within the past \u224865,000 years, which is a time frame that covers from the earliest of the 'Out of Africa' migrations up to now.\n\n==Disease==\n{{See also|Hair diseases|}}\n[[Tinea corporis|Ringworm]] is a [[mycosis|fungal disease]] that targets hairy skin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dermatologyinfo.net/english/chapters/chapter10.htm |title=Dermatologyinfo.net |publisher=Dermatologyinfo.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205201/http://www.dermatologyinfo.net/english/chapters/chapter10.htm |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Premature greying of hair]] is another condition that results in greying before the age of 20 years in Whites, before 25 years in Asians, and before 30 years in Africans.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2013;volume=79;issue=5;spage=641;epage=653;aulast=Pandhi#ref4 |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816003234/http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2013;volume=79;issue=5;spage=641;epage=653;aulast=Pandhi#ref4 |archive-date=16 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Hair care ==\n{{Main|Hair care}}\nHair care involves the [[hygiene]] and [[cosmetology]] of hair including hair on the [[scalp]], facial hair ([[beard]] and [[moustache]]), [[pubic hair]] and other body hair. Hair care routines differ according to an individual's culture and the physical characteristics of one's hair. Hair may be colored, trimmed, shaved, plucked, or otherwise removed with treatments such as waxing, sugaring, and threading.\n\n===Removal practices===\n[[Depilation]] is the removal of hair from the surface of the skin. This can be achieved through methods such as [[shaving]]. [[Epilation]] is the removal of the entire hair strand, including the part of the hair that has not yet left the follicle. A popular way to epilate hair is through [[waxing]].\n\n====Shaving====\n[[File:Shaving-system-2blade.jpg|thumb|Many razors have multiple blades purportedly to ensure a close shave. While shaving initially will leave skin feeling smooth and hair free, new hair growth can appear a few hours after hair removal.]]\n[[Shaving]] is accomplished with bladed instruments, such as [[razors]]. The [[blade]] is brought close to the skin and stroked over the hair in the desired area to cut the terminal hairs and leave the skin feeling smooth. Depending upon the rate of growth, one can begin to feel the hair growing back within hours of shaving. This is especially evident in men who develop a [[five o'clock shadow]] after having shaved their faces. This new growth is called [[Shaving|stubble]]. Stubble typically appears to grow back thicker because the shaved hairs are blunted instead of tapered off at the end, although the hair never actually grows back thicker.\n\n====Waxing====\n[[Waxing]] involves using a sticky wax and strip of paper or cloth to pull hair from the root. Waxing is the ideal hair removal technique to keep an area hair-free for long periods of time. It can take three to five weeks for waxed hair to begin to resurface again. Hair in areas that have been waxed consistently is known to grow back finer and thinner, especially compared to hair that has been shaved with a razor.\n\n====Laser removal====\n{{main|Laser hair removal}}\n\nLaser hair removal is a cosmetic method where a small [[laser]] beam pulses selective heat on dark target matter in the area that causes hair growth without harming the skin tissue.  This process is repeated several times over the course of many months to a couple of years with hair regrowing less frequently until it finally stops; this is used as a more permanent solution to [[waxing]] or [[shaving]].  Laser removal is practiced in many clinics along with many at-home products.\n\n====Cutting and trimming====\n{{see also|Ponytail}}\n\nBecause the hair on one's head is normally longer than other types of body hair, it is cut with [[scissors]] or [[Manual hair clippers|clippers]]. People with longer hair will most often use scissors to cut their hair, whereas shorter hair is maintained using a trimmer. Depending on the desired length and overall health of the hair, periods without cutting or trimming the hair can vary.\n\nCut hair may be used in [[wig]]s. Global imports of hair in 2010 was worth $US 1.24 billion.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=Ankush|title=Human Hair \"Waste\" and Its Utilization: Gaps and Possibilities|journal=Journal of Waste Management|date=27 April 2014|doi=10.1155/2014/498018|volume=2014|pages=1\u201317|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Social role==\n{{See also|Hairstyle}}\n[[File:Alessandro Allori - Portrait of Bianca Cappello.jpg|thumb|right|''Portrait of a Woman,'' Alessandro Allori (1535\u20131607; [[Uffizi Gallery]]): a plucked hairline gives a fashionably \"noble brow\"]]\nHair has great social significance for [[human being]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.42.6 | issue=42 | title=Archaeologies of Hair: the head and its grooming in ancient and contemporary societies | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Ashby | first1 = Steven P.| doi-access=free }}</ref> \n<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.42.6.13 | issue=42 | title=Because You're Worth It: Women's daily hair care routines in contemporary Britain | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Hielscher | first1 = Sabine | doi-access=free }}</ref> It can grow on most external areas of the [[human body]], except on the palms of the [[hand]]s and the soles of the feet (among other areas). Hair is most noticeable on most people in a small number of areas, which are also the ones that are most commonly trimmed, [[Plucking (hair removal)|plucked]], or [[shaving|shaved]]. These include the [[face]], [[ear]]s, [[human head|head]], eyebrows, [[human leg|leg]]s, and [[armpit]]s, as well as the [[pubic region]]. The highly visible differences between male and female body and facial hair are a notable [[secondary sex characteristic]].\n\nThe world's longest documented hair belongs to Xie Qiuping (China), at 5.627 m (18&nbsp;ft 5.54 in) when measured on 8 May 2004.

Hair color and texture can be a sign of ethnic ancestry. [[Facial hair]] is a sign of [[puberty]] in men. White hair is a sign of age or genetics, which may be concealed with [[Hair coloring|hair dye]] (not easily for some), although many prefer to assume it (especially if it is a [[poliosis]] characteristic of the person since childhood). Male pattern [[baldness]] is a sign of age, which may be concealed with a [[toupee]], hats, or religious and cultural adornments. Although drugs and medical procedures exist for the treatment of baldness, many balding men simply shave their heads. In early modern China, the queue was a male hairstyle worn by the Manchus from central Manchuria and the Han Chinese during the Qing dynasty; hair on the front of the head was shaved off above the temples every ten days, mimicking male-pattern baldness,  and the rest of the hair braided into a long pigtail.\n\n[[Hairstyle]] may be an indicator of group membership. During the [[English Civil War]], the followers of [[Oliver Cromwell]] decided to crop their hair close to their head, as an act of defiance to the curls and ringlets of the king's men.<ref>Olmert, Michael (1996).

Female art students known as the \"cropheads\" also adopted the style, notably at the Slade School in London, England. Regional variations in [[hirsutism]] cause practices regarding hair on the arms and legs to differ. Some religious groups may follow certain rules regarding hair as part of religious observance. The rules often differ for men and women.\n\nMany subcultures have hairstyles which may indicate an unofficial membership. Many [[hippie]]s, [[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]] and Indian [[sadhus]] have [[long hair]], as well many older [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|indie kids]]. Many [[punk fashion|punks]] wear a hairstyle known as a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] or other spiked and dyed hairstyles; [[skinhead]]s have short-cropped or completely shaved heads. Long stylized bangs were very common for [[Emo (stereotype)|emo]]s, [[Scene (subculture)|scene kids]] and younger [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|indie kids]] in the 2000s and early 2010s, among people of both [[gender]]s.\n\nHeads were shaved in [[concentration camp]]s, and head-shaving has been used as [[punishment]], especially for women with long hair. The shaven head is common in [[military]] haircuts, while Western monks are known for the [[tonsure]]. By contrast, among some Indian holy men, the hair is worn extremely long.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn the time of Confucius (5th century BCE), the Chinese grew out their hair and often tied it, as a symbol of filial piety.\n\nRegular hairdressing in some cultures is considered a sign of wealth or status. The [[dreadlocks]] of the [[Rastafari movement]] were despised early in the movement's history. In some cultures, having one's hair cut can symbolize a liberation from one's past, usually after a trying time in one's life. Cutting the hair also may be a sign of mourning.\n\nTightly coiled hair in its natural state may be worn in an [[Afro]]. This hairstyle was once worn among [[African American]]s as a symbol of racial pride. Given that the coiled texture is the natural state of some African Americans' hair, or perceived as being more \"African\", this simple style is now often seen as a sign of self-acceptance and an affirmation that the beauty norms of the ([[Eurocentrism|eurocentric]]) dominant culture are not absolute. It is important to note that African Americans as a whole have a variety of hair textures, as they are not an ethnically homogeneous group, but an ad-hoc of different racial admixtures.\n\nThe film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) includes the assumption that the two main characters could have their long hairs forcibly shaved with a rusty razor when jailed, symbolizing the intolerance of some conservative groups toward members of the [[counterculture]]. At the conclusion of the [[Oz trial|Oz obscenity trials in the UK in 1971]], the defendants had their heads shaved by the police, causing public outcry. During the appeal trial, they appeared in the dock wearing wigs.<ref>[[Jonathon Green|Green, Jonathon]], (1999). ''All Dressed Up: The Sixties and the Counterculture''.

[[Russian Orthodox Church]] requires all married women to wear headscarves inside the church; this tradition is often extended to all women, regardless of marital status. [[Orthodox Judaism]] also commands the use of scarves and other head coverings for married women for modesty reasons. Certain [[Hindu]] sects also wear head scarves for religious reasons. [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] have an obligation not to cut hair (a Sikh cutting hair becomes 'apostate' which means fallen from religion)<ref>Dilgeer, Harjinder Singh (2005) ''Dictionary of Sikh Philosophy'', Sikh University Press.</ref> and men keep it tied in a bun on the head, which is then covered appropriately using a [[turban]]. Multiple religions, both ancient and contemporary, require or advise one to allow their hair to become [[dreadlocks]], though people also wear them for fashion. For men, Islam, Orthodox Judaism, Orthodox Christianity, Roman Catholicism, and other religious groups have at various times recommended or required the covering of the head and sections of the hair of men, and some have dictates relating to the cutting of men's facial and head hair. Some Christian sects throughout history and up to modern times have also religiously proscribed the cutting of women's hair. For some [[Sunni]] [[madhab]]s, the donning of a [[kufi]] or [[Taqiyah (cap)|topi]] is a form of [[sunnah]].<ref>The War Within Our Hearts \u2013 Page 65 Sa'ad Quadri \u2013 2013</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col}}\n* [[Chaetophobia]] \u2013 the fear of hair\n* [[Hair analysis (alternative medicine)]]\n* [[Hypertrichosis]] \u2013 the state of having an excess of hair on the head or body\n* [[Hypotrichosis]] \u2013 the state of having a less than normal amount of hair on the head or body\n* [[Lanugo]]\n* [[Seta]] \u2013 hair-like structures in insects\n* [[Trichotillomania]] \u2013 hair pulling\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite journal |ref=Iyengar1998 |last=Iyengar |first=B. |year=1998 |title=The hair follicle is a specialized UV receptor in human skin? |journal=Bio Signals Recep |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=188\u2013194 |doi=10.1159/000014544 |pmid=9672761 }}\n* {{cite book |ref=Jablonski2006 |last=Jablonski |first=N.G. |year=2006 |title=Skin: a natural history |url=https://archive.org/details/skinnaturalhisto00jabl |url-access=registration |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=University of California Press}}\n* {{cite journal |ref=Rogers2004 |last1=Rogers |first1=Alan R. |last2=Iltis |first2=David |last3=Wooding |first3=Stephen |year=2004 |title=Genetic variation at the MC1R locus and the time since loss of human body hair |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=105\u2013108 |doi=10.1086/381006 }}\n* {{cite journal |ref=Tishkoff1996 |last=Tishkoff |first=S.
