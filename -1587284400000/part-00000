It remained unclimbed after most of the other great Alpine peaks had been attained and became the subject of an international competition for the summit. The [[first ascent of the Matterhorn]] was in 1865 from Zermatt by a party led by [[Edward Whymper]]; it ended when four of its seven members fell to their deaths on the descent.

Three of them (north, east and west) are on the Swiss side of the border and watershed ([[Mattertal]] valley) and one of them (south) is on the Italian side of the border ([[Valtournenche]] valley). The north face overlooks the [[Ober Gabelhorn]] (7&nbsp;km away) across the [[Zmutt Glacier]] and valley (above [[Zermatt]]), the east face overlooks the [[Gorner Glacier]] system between the [[Gornergrat]] and [[Monte Rosa]] (respectively 10 and 17&nbsp;km away) across the [[Theodul Pass]], the west face overlooks the upper basin of the Zmutt Glacier between the [[Dent Blanche]] and the [[Dent d'H\u00e9rens]] (respectively 7 and 4&nbsp;km away) and the south face fronts the resort town of [[Breuil-Cervinia]] and overlooks a good portion of the Valtournenche. The Matterhorn does not form a perfect [[square pyramid]], as the north and south faces are wider than the west and east faces. Moreover, the latter faces do not actually meet on the summit but are connected by a 100-metre-long horizontal west\u2013east ridge between the north and south faces.\n\nThe Matterhorn's faces are steep, and only small patches of snow and ice cling to them; regular [[avalanche]]s send the snow down to accumulate on the [[glacier]]s at the base of each face, the largest of which are the Tiefmattengletscher to the west, part of the [[Zmutt Glacier]], and the [[Matterhorn Glacier]] to the north. Smaller glaciers lie at the base of the south face (the Lower Matterhorn Glacier) and the east face (unnamed). In this area, the border between Switzerland and Italy coincides with the [[Main chain of the Alps|main Alpine watershed]], separating the [[drainage basin]] of the [[Rhone]] on the north ([[Mediterranean Sea]]) and that of the [[Po (river)|Po]] on the south ([[Adriatic Sea]]). The north side is drained by the Zmuttbach (west and north faces) and the Gornera through the Furggbach (east face), tributaries of the Rhone through the (Matter) Vispa.<ref>The Vispa, formed by the Matter Vispa and Saaser Vispa, runs only a few kilometres before its ends in the Rhone.</ref> The south side and face is drained by the Marmore torrent, tributary of the Po through the [[Dora Baltea]] (or ''Doire balt\u00e9e''). The [[Theodul Pass]], located on the watershed between the Matterhorn and the [[Breithorn]], at 3,295 metres, is the easiest passage between the two valleys and countries (the slightly lower Furggjoch not being used as a pass). The pass was used as a crossover and trade route for the Romans and the Romanised Celtic population ''[[Salassi]]'' between 100 BCE and 400 CE.<ref>[http://zermatt.gadmin.ch/files/?id=18556 Key dates in the history of Zermatt]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on 2009-10-19</ref> The area is now heavily glaciated and covered on the north side by the [[Theodul Glacier]].\n\nWell-known faces are the east and north, visible from the area of Zermatt, although mostly hidden from the Mattertal by the chain of the [[Weisshorn]]. The east face is 1,000 metres high and, because it is \"a long, monotonous slope of rotten rocks\",<ref name=Collomb>Robin G. Collomb, ''Pennine Alps Central'', London: Alpine Club, 1975, pp. 241\u201359</ref> presents a high risk of rockfall, making its ascent dangerous. The north face is 1,200 metres high and is one of the [[Great north faces of the Alps|most dangerous north faces in the Alps]], in particular for its risk of rockfall and storms. The south face, well visible from the Valtournenche, is 1,350 metres high and offers many different routes. The west face, the highest at 1,400 metres, has the fewest ascent routes and lies in a more remote area than the other faces.\n\nThe four main ridges separating the four faces are the main climbing routes. The least difficult technical climb and the usual [[climbing route]], the H\u00f6rnli ridge (''H\u00f6rnligrat''), lies between the east and north faces and is aligned towards the [[Oberrothorn]] above Zermatt. To its west lies the Zmutt ridge (''Zmuttgrat''), between the north and west faces and aligned towards the [[Wandfluehorn]]; this is, according to Collomb, \"the classic route up the mountain, its longest ridge, also the most disjointed.\"<ref name=Collomb/> The ''Lion'' ridge (''Cresta del Leone'' / ''Ar\u00eate du lion''), lying between the south and west faces and aligned towards the Dent d'H\u00e9rens is the Italian normal route and goes across [[Pic Tyndall]]; Collomb comments, \"A superb rock ridge, the shortest on the mountain, now draped with many fixed ropes, but a far superior climb compared with the H\u00f6rnli.\"<ref name=Collomb/> Finally the south side is separated from the east side by the Furggen ridge (''Furggengrat''), which is aligned towards the [[Klein Matterhorn]]. It is, according to Collomb, \"the hardest of the ridges [...] the ridge still has an awesome reputation but is not too difficult in good conditions by the indirect finish\".<ref name=Collomb/>\n\nWhile the Matterhorn is the culminating point of the Valtournenche on the south, it is only one of the many [[List of Alpine four-thousanders|4000 metres summits]] of the Mattertal valley on the north. Its height is exceeded by four major summits<!--300 m prominence summits only are listed below-->: the [[Weisshorn]] (4,505 m), the [[Dom (mountain)|Dom]] (4,545 m), the [[Liskamm]] (4,527 m) and the second highest in the Alps, [[Monte Rosa]] (4,634 m). This section of the [[Pennine Alps]], including the Matterhorn, the [[Zinalrothorn]], the [[Dent Blanche]], the [[Dent d'H\u00e9rens]], the [[Breithorn]], the [[Strahlhorn]], the [[Rimpfischhorn]] and the [[Alphubel]], concentrates most of western Europe's highest mountains and forms a crown of peaks around Zermatt. The deeply glaciated region between the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa (named ''Dent Blanche-Matterhorn-Monte Rosa'') is listed in the [[Federal Inventory of Landscapes and Natural Monuments]] since 1983.\n\n{{Multiple image\n | align = center\n | header = The four faces of the Matterhorn:\n | image1 = Matterhorn - North face crop.png\n | width1 = 200\n | caption1 = North\n | image2 = Hauteroute crop.jpg\n | width2 = 200\n | caption2  = West\n | image3 = Cervino versante sud crop.JPG\n | width3 = 200\n | caption3  = South\n | image4 = East face crop.jpg \n | width4 = 200\n | caption4  = East\n}}\n\n==Weather==\nThe Matterhorn is an isolated mountain. Because of its position on the main Alpine [[Drainage divide|watershed]] and its great height, the Matterhorn is exposed to rapid weather changes. In addition, the steep faces of the mountain and its isolated location make it prone to [[Orographic lift|banner clouds]] formation, with the air flowing around the mountain producing condensation of the air on the lee side and also creating vortices.\n\n==Geology==\n{{see also|Geology of the Alps}}\nApart from the base of the mountain, the Matterhorn is composed of [[gneiss]] belonging to the [[Dent Blanche klippe]], an isolated part of the [[Austroalpine nappes]], lying over the [[Penninic nappes]]. The Austroalpine nappes are part of the [[Apulian plate]], a small continent which broke up from Africa before the [[Alpine orogeny]]. For this reason the Matterhorn has been popularized as an African mountain. The Austroalpine nappes are mostly common in the Eastern Alps.\n\nThe Swiss explorer and geologist [[Horace-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure]], inspired by the view of the Matterhorn, anticipated the modern theories of geology:\n\n{{Quotation|What power must have been required to shatter and to sweep away the missing parts of this pyramid; for we do not see it surrounded by heaps of fragments; one only sees other peaks - themselves rooted to the ground - whose sides, equally rent, indicate an immense mass of d\u00e9bris, of which we do not see any trace in the neighbourhood. Doubtless this is that d\u00e9bris which, in the form of pebbles, boulders, and sand, fills our valleys and our plains.<ref>Edward Whymper, ''Scrambles amongst the Alps'', 6th edition, London: John Murray, 1936, p. 80</ref>}}\n\n===Formation===\n[[Image:Matterhorn002.jpg|thumb|Different layers of rock can be seen: the lower part is [[sedimentary rock]] (brown); the middle part is [[greenschist]] from the oceanic crust. The peak itself is [[gneiss]] from the African continent.]]\n\nThe formation of the Matterhorn (and the whole Alpine range) started with the break-up of the [[Pangaea]] continent 200 million years ago into [[Laurasia]] (containing Europe) and [[Gondwana]] (containing Africa). While the rocks constituting the nearby [[Monte Rosa]] remained in Laurasia, the rocks constituting the Matterhorn found themselves in Gondwana, separated by the newly formed [[Tethys Ocean]].\n\n100 million years ago the extension of the Tethys Ocean stopped and the Apulian plate broke from Gondwana and moved toward the European continent. This resulted in the closure of the western Tethys by [[subduction]] under the Apulian plate (with the [[Piemont-Liguria Ocean]] first and [[Valais Ocean]] later). The subduction of the oceanic crust left traces still visible today at the base of the Matterhorn ([[accretionary prism]]). The orogeny itself began after the end of the oceanic subduction when the European continental crust collided with the Apulian continent, resulting in the formation of [[nappe]]s.\nThe Matterhorn acquired its characteristic pyramidal shape in much more recent times as it was caused by natural erosion over the past million years. At the beginning of alpine orogeny, the Matterhorn was only a rounded mountain like a hill. Because its height is above the [[snowline]], its flanks are covered by ice, resulting from the accumulation and compaction of snow. During the warmer period of summer, part of the ice melts and seeps into the bedrock. When it freezes again, it fractures pieces of rock because of its dilatation ([[freeze-thaw]]), forming a [[cirque]]. Four cirques led to the shape of the mountain. Because of its recognizable shape, many other similar mountains around the world were named or nicknamed the 'Matterhorn' of their respective countries or mountain ranges.<ref>[http://www.cervintopmodel.com/news/jouty.html A list of 109 world 'Matterhorns' CERVIN top model des Alpes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017120656/http://cervintopmodel.com/news/jouty.html |date=2007-10-17 }} Retrieved 15 October 2007 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref>\n\n===Rocks===\nMost of the base of the mountain lies in the Tsat\u00e9 nappe, a remnant of the Piedmont-Liguria oceanic crust ([[ophiolites]]) and its sedimentary rocks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/RSTGV/00161/RSTGV-A-00161.pdf|title=The Matterhorn - Really from Africa?}}</ref> Up to 3,400 metres the mountain is composed of successive layers of ophiolites and [[sedimentary rock]]s.

The Matterhorn remained relatively little known until 1865, but the successful ascent followed by the tragic accident of the expedition led by [[Edward Whymper]] caused a rush on the mountains surrounding [[Zermatt]].\n\nThe construction of the railway linking the village of Zermatt from the town of [[Visp]] started in 1888. The first train reached Zermatt on July 18, 1891 and the entire line was electrified in 1930.<ref>[http://www.mgbahn.ch/anotrepropos/histoire/bvzzermatt-bahn.php Histoire du BVZ Zermatt-Bahn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021081309/http://www.mgbahn.ch/anotrepropos/histoire/bvzzermatt-bahn.php |date=2007-10-21 }} mgbahn.ch. Retrieved on 2009-10-16</ref> Since 1930 the village is directly connected to [[St. Moritz]] by the [[Glacier Express]] panoramic train. However there is no connection with the village of [[Breuil-Cervinia]] on the Italian side. Travellers have to hire mountain guides to cross the 3,300-metre-high glaciated [[Theodul Pass]], separating the two resorts. The town of Zermatt remains almost completely free of internal combustion vehicles and can be reached by train only. (Apart from the local police service which uses a Volkswagen car, only electric vehicles are used locally).\n\n[[File:2007 Matterhorn.jpg|thumb|upright|left|View from the train to the Gornergrat]]\n\nRail and cable-car facilities have been built to make some of the summits in the area more accessible. The [[Gornergrat railway]], reaching a record altitude of 3,100 metres, was inaugurated in 1898. Areas served by cable car are the [[Unterrothorn]] and the [[Klein Matterhorn]] (''Little Matterhorn'') (3,883 m, highest transportation system in Europe). The [[H\u00f6rnli Hut]] (3,260 m), which is the start of the normal route via the H\u00f6rnli ridge, is easily accessible from [[Schwarzsee (Zermatt)|Schwarzsee]] (2,600 m) and is also frequented by hikers. The Zermatt and Breuil-Cervinia resorts function as separate ski resort all year round and are connected by skilifts over the Theodul Pass. In 2015 it was expected that there would be constructed a cable car link between Testa Grigia (or ''T\u00eate grise'') and Klein Matterhorn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.matterhornparadise.ch/en/Company/Investments-and-projects|title=Investments and projects : Matterhorn - Zermatt|website=www.matterhornparadise.ch}}</ref> It will finally provide a link between the Swiss and Italian side of the Matterhorn.<ref>[http://www.zermatt.ch/en/page.cfm/lifts_and_pistes/zermatt_bergbahnen_ag/projects Zermatt Bergbahnen AG, Projects] Retrieved on 2009-10-22</ref>\n\nThe [[Matterhorn Museum]] (Zermatt) relates the general history of the region from alpinism to tourism. In the museum, which is in the form of a reconstituted mountain village, the visitors can relive the first and tragic ascent of the Matterhorn and see the objects having belonged to the protagonists.\n\nThe Tour of the Matterhorn can be effected by trekkers in about 10 days. Considered by some as one of the most beautiful treks in the Alps, it follows many ancient trails that have linked the Swiss and Italian valleys for centuries. The circuit includes alpine meadows, balcony trails, larch forests and glacial crossings. It connects six valleys embracing three different cultures: the German-speaking high Valais, the French-speaking central Valais and the bilingual French/Italian-speaking Aosta Valley. Good conditions are necessary to circumnavigate the peak. After reaching [[Zinal]] from Zermatt by the Augstbord and Meiden passes, the trekker crosses the Col de Sorebois and the Col de Torrent before arriving at [[Arolla]]. Then the [[Arolla Glacier]] and the [[Col Collon]] must be crossed on the way to [[Prarayer]], followed by the Col de Valcournera to Breuil-Cervinia. In the last and highest section, the [[Theodul Pass]] must be crossed before returning to Zermatt. In total, seven passes between 2,800 and 3,300 metres must be crossed on a relatively difficult terrain.<ref>Hilary Sharp, ''Tour of the Matterhorn'', Cicerone</ref>\n\nAs of 2015 almost two million visitors arrive at Zermatt annually.

The first serious attempts were all from the Italian side, although despite appearances the southern routes are technically harder.

Upon descent, Hadow, Croz, Hudson and Douglas fell to their deaths on the [[Matterhorn Glacier]], and all but Douglas (whose body was never found) are buried in the Zermatt churchyard.\n\nJust three days later, on July 17, 1865, Jean-Antoine Carrel and [[Jean-Baptiste Bich]] reached the summit from the Italian side.<ref name=Collomb/>\n\n=== Before the first ascent ===\nIn the summer of 1860, Edward Whymper came across the Matterhorn for the first time. He was an English artist and engraver who had been hired by a London publisher to make sketches of the mountains in the region of [[Zermatt]]. Although the unclimbed Matterhorn had a mixed reputation among British mountaineers, it fascinated Whymper. Whymper's first attempt was in August 1861, from the village of [[Breuil-Cervinia|Breuil]] on the south side. In [[Chatillon, Aosta Valley|Ch\u00e2tillon]] he hired a Swiss guide, who remained anonymous in his accounts, and in Valtournanche he almost hired Jean-Antoine Carrel as well, but, disliking the looks of Carrel's uncle, he changed his mind.<ref name = taotm/> The Carrels decided to give Matterhorn a try by themselves again, and caught up with Whymper at nightfall. Whymper now had \"a strong inclination to engage the pair; but, finally, decided against it\" and the Carrels went alone to reach a new high on Matterhorn of {{convert|4032|m|abbr=on}} the next day. Whymper and his guide camped one more night on the ''Col du lion'' (= Col Tournanche) {{convert|3479|m|abbr=on}} and were forced to turn around only an hour above this pass the day after.<ref name = taotm/>\n\n[[File:Rifugio Carrel.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Refuge Jean-Antoine Carrel|Carrel Hut]] (3,830 m) on the Lion ridge]]\n\nIn 1862 Whymper made further attempts, still from the south side, on the Lion ridge (or Italian ridge), where the route seemed easier than the H\u00f6rnli ridge (the normal route today). On his own he reached above 4,000 metres, but was injured on his way down to Breuil. In July [[John Tyndall]] with Johann Joseph Bennen and another guide overcame most of the difficulties of the ridge that seemed so formidable from below and [[Pic Tyndall|successfully reached the main shoulder]]; but at a point not very far below the summit they were stopped by a deep cleft that defied their utmost efforts. The Matterhorn remained unclimbed.\n\nWhymper returned to Breuil in 1863, persuading Carrel to join forces with him and try the mountain once more via the Italian ridge. On this attempt, however, a storm soon developed and they were stuck halfway to the summit. They remained there for 26 hours in their tent before giving up. Whymper did not make another attempt for two years.\n\nIn the decisive year 1865, Whymper returned with new plans, deciding to attack the Matterhorn via its south face instead of the Italian ridge. On June 21, Whymper began his ascent with Swiss guides, but halfway up they experienced severe rockfall; although nobody was injured, they decided to give up the ascent. This was Whymper's seventh attempt.\n\nDuring the following weeks, Whymper spent his time climbing other mountains in the area with his guides, before going back to Breuil on July 7. Meanwhile the [[Italian Alpine Club]] was founded and its leaders, [[Felice Giordano]] and [[Quintino Sella]], established plans to conquer the Matterhorn before any non-Italian could succeed. Felice Giordano hired Carrel as a guide. He feared the arrival of Whymper, now a rival, and wrote to Quintino Sella:<ref>Roger W. Patillo, ''The Canadian Rockies: Pioneers, Legends and True Tales'', p. 176</ref>\n{{quote|I have tried to keep everything secret, but that fellow whose life seems to depend on the Matterhorn is here, suspiciously prying into everything. I have taken all the best men away from him; and yet he is so enamored of the mountain that he may go with others...He is here in the hotel and I try to avoid speaking to him.}}\n\n[[File:Matterhorn from the south.jpg|thumb|The Matterhorn seen from the [[Valtournenche]] Valley]]\n\nJust as he did two years before, Whymper asked Carrel to be his guide, but Carrel declined; Whymper was also unsuccessful in hiring other local guides from Breuil. When Whymper discovered Giordano and Carrel's plan, he left Breuil and crossed the [[Theodul Pass]] to Zermatt to hire local guides. He encountered [[Lord Francis Douglas]], a Scottish mountaineer, who also wanted to climb the Matterhorn. They arrived later in Zermatt in the [[Monte Rosa Hotel]], where they met two other British climbers \u2014 the [[Charles Hudson (climber)|Reverend Charles Hudson]] and his young and inexperienced companion, [[Douglas Robert Hadow]] \u2014 who had hired the French guide [[Michel Croz]] to try to make the first ascent. These two groups decided to join forces and try the ascent of the H\u00f6rnli ridge. They hired another two local guides, a father and son, both named Peter Taugwalder.\n\n=== First ascent ===\n{{main|First ascent of the Matterhorn}}\nWhymper and party left Zermatt early in the morning of July 13, 1865, heading to the foot of the H\u00f6rnli ridge, which they reached 6 hours later (approximately where the H\u00f6rnli Hut is situated today). Meanwhile Carrel and six other Italian guides also began their ascent of the Italian ridge.\n\nDespite its appearance, Whymper wrote that the H\u00f6rnli ridge was much easier to climb than the Italian ridge:\n{{quote|We were now fairly upon the mountain, and were astonished to find that places which from the Riffel, or even from the Furggen Glacier, looked entirely impracticable, were so easy that we could ''run about''.<ref name=Whymper>Edward Whymper, ''Scrambles amongst the Alps'', 6th edition, London: John Murray, 1936, pp. 309\u201313</ref>}}\n[[Image:Matterhorn ascent Dore.jpg|thumb|upright|The first ascent of the Matterhorn, by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]]]\nAfter camping for the night, Whymper and party started on the ridge. According to Whymper:\n{{quote|The whole of this great slope was now revealed, rising for 3,000 feet like a huge natural staircase. Some parts were more, and others were less, easy; but we were not once brought to a halt by any serious impediment, for when an obstruction was met in front it could always be turned to the right or left. For the greater part of the way there was, indeed, no occasion for the rope, and sometimes Hudson led, sometimes myself. At 6.20 we had attained a height of 12,800 feet and halted for half an hour; we then continued the ascent without a break until 9.55, when we stopped for fifty minutes, at a height of 14,000 feet.<ref name=Whymper/>}}\nWhen the party came close to the summit, they had to leave the ridge for the north face because \"[the ridge] was usually more rotten and steep, and always more difficult than the face\".<ref name=Whymper/> At this point of the ascent Whymper wrote that the less experienced Hadow \"required continual assistance\".<ref name=Whymper/> Having overcome these difficulties the group finally arrived in the summit area, with Croz and Whymper reaching the top first.\n{{quote|The slope eased off, and Croz and I, dashing away, ran a neck-and-neck race, which ended in a dead heat. At 1.40 p.m. the world was at our feet, and the Matterhorn was conquered. Hurrah! Not a footstep could be seen.<ref name=Whymper/>}}\nPrecisely at this moment, Carrel and party were approximatively 400 metres below, still dealing with the most difficult parts of the Italian ridge. When seeing his rival on the summit, Carrel and party gave up on their attempt and went back to Breuil.\n[[Image:Matterhorn disaster Dore.jpg|thumb|upright|The first descent of the Matterhorn, by Gustave Dor\u00e9]]\nAfter building a [[cairn]], Whymper and party stayed an hour on the summit. Then they began their descent of the H\u00f6rnli ridge. Croz descended first, then Hadow, Hudson and Douglas, the elder Taugwalder, Whymper, with the younger Taugwalder coming last. They climbed down with great care, only one man moving at a time. Whymper wrote:\n\n{{quote|As far as I know, at the moment of the accident no one was actually moving. I cannot speak with certainty, neither can the Taugwalders, because the two leading men were partially hidden from our sight by an intervening mass of rock. Poor Croz had laid aside his axe, and in order to give Mr. Hadow greater security was absolutely taking hold of his legs and putting his feet, one by one, into their proper positions. From the movements of their shoulders it is my belief that Croz, having done as I have said, was in the act of turning round to go down a step or two himself; at this moment Mr. Hadow slipped, fell on him, and knocked him over.<ref>''The Times'' 08-08-1865, p 9</ref>}}\n\nThe weight of the falling men pulled Hudson and Douglas from their holds and dragged them down the north face. The Taugwalders and Whymper were left alive when the rope linking Douglas to the elder Taugwalder broke. They were stunned by the accident and for a time could not move until the younger Taugwalder descended to enable them to advance. When they were together Whymper asked to see the broken rope and saw that it had been employed by mistake as it was the weakest and oldest of the three ropes they had brought. They frantically looked, but in vain, for traces of their fallen companions. They continued their descent, including an hour in the dark, until 9.30 p.m. when a resting place was found. At daybreak the descent was resumed and the group finally reached Zermatt, where a search of the victims was quickly organized. The bodies of Croz, Hadow and Hudson were found on the [[Matterhorn Glacier]], but the body of Douglas was never found. Although the elder Taugwalder was accused of cutting the rope to save himself and his son, the official inquest found no proof of this.\n\n===Second ascent===\n{{Main|Second ascent of the Matterhorn}}\n[[File:Le Cervin.jpg|thumb|left|South-west side of the Matterhorn ([[Pic Tyndall|Tyndall shoulder]] on the foreground)]]\nOn July 16, two days after the first ascent and the catastrophe, [[Jean-Antoine Carrel]] set out to crown Whymper's victory by proving that the Italian side was not unconquerable. He was accompanied by [[Am\u00e9 Gorret]], a priest who had shared with him the first attempt on the mountain back in 1857. Jean-Baptiste Bich and Jean-Augustin Meynet completed the party. [[Felice Giordano|Giordano]] would have joined them, but Carrel refused absolutely to take him with them; he said he would not have the strength to guide a traveller, and could neither answer for the result nor for any one's life. After hearing Sunday mass at the chapel of Breuil, the party started. Am\u00e9 Gorret has described this ascent with enthusiasm: \"At last we crossed the Col du Lion and set foot upon the pyramid of the Matterhorn!\" On the following day, the 17th, they continued the ascent and reached Tyndall's flagstaff. \"We were about to enter unknown country,\" wrote Gorret, \"for no man had gone beyond this point.\" Here opinions were divided; Gorret suggested ascending by the ridge and scaling the last tower straight up. Carrel was inclined to traverse to the west of the peak, and thence go up on the Zmutt side. Naturally the wish of Carrel prevailed, for he was the leader and had not lost the habit of command, notwithstanding his recent defeat.<ref name = Rey>Guido Rey, ''The Matterhorn'' (translated J. E. C. Eaton), London, 1908, p. 140</ref>\n\nThey made the passage of the ''enjamb\u00e9e'', and traversed the west face to reach the Zmutt ridge. A false step made by one of the party and a fall of icicles from above warned them to return to the direct line of ascent, and the traverse back to the Lion ridge was one of the greatest difficulty. A falling stone injured Gorret in the arm.<ref name = Rey/>\n\nAt last they reached the base of the final tower. \"We stood,\" wrote Gorret, \"in a place that was almost comfortable. Although it was not more than two yards wide, and the slope was one of 75 percent, we gave it all kinds of pleasant names : the corridor, the gallery, the railroad, &c., &c.\" They imagined all difficulties were at an end; but a rock [[couloir]], which they had hitherto not observed, lay between them and the final bit of ridge, where progress would be perfectly easy. It would have been unwise for all four to descend into the couloir, because they did not know where to fix the rope that would be needed on their return. Time pressed: it was necessary to reduce the numbers of the party; Gorret sacrificed himself, and Meynet stopped with him. Very soon afterwards Carrel and Bich were finally on the top. Meanwhile Giordano at Breuil was writing in his diary as follows: \"Splendid weather; at 9.30 saw Carrel and his men on the Shoulder, after that saw nothing more of them. Then much mist about the summit. Lifted a bit about 3.30, and we saw our flag on the western summit of the Matterhorn.\"<ref name = Rey/>\n\n=== Other ascents ===\n\n====Ridges====\n{{Multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 220\n | image1 = Matterhorn - Zmuttgrat.jpg\n | caption1 = The north and west faces with the snowy Zmutt ridge in the centre\n | image2 = Zmutt ridge.jpg\n | caption2 = View from the ridge ({{circa|3,900 m}})\n}}\n\nThe first direct ascent of the Italian (south-west) ridge as it is climbed today was by J.

Whymper\u2019s book about his first ascent, ''Scrambles Amongst the Alps'', published in 1871, was a worldwide bestseller. Tourists began to visit Switzerland in the summer to see the Alps and often hired locals as guides. With the beginning of alpine skiing in the early 20th century, tourists began traveling to Switzerland in winter also. Mountaineering, in part, helped transform Switzerland\u2019s mountain regions from poor rural areas to tourist destinations. This combination of mountain climbing, skiing and tourism, was used in the western United States, creating [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]], [[Vail Ski Resort|Vail]], [[Jackson Hole Mountain Resort|Jackson Hole]], and other mountain towns around the world.<ref>{{cite web|title = How the Matterhorn Created Modern Mountaineering 150 Years Ago|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/07/150714-matterhorn-switzerland-mountaineering-climbing-adventure-world|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-07-15|first = Mark Jenkins PUBLISHED July|last = 14}}</ref>\n\n== Climbing routes ==\n[[File:H\u00f6rnlih\u00fctte weg.jpg|thumb|Trail to the [[H\u00f6rnli Hut]]]]\n\nToday, all ridges and faces of the Matterhorn have been ascended in all seasons, and [[mountain guide]]s take a large number of people up the northeast H\u00f6rnli route each summer. In total, up to 150 climbers attempt the Matterhorn each day during summer. By modern standards, the climb is fairly difficult (AD [[Grade (climbing)|Difficulty rating]]), but not hard for skilled mountaineers according to [[Grade (climbing)#International French Adjectival System (IFAS)|French climbing grades]]. There are [[fixed rope]]s on parts of the route to help. Still, it should be remembered that several climbers may die on the mountain each year.\n\nThe usual pattern of ascent is to take the [[Schwarzsee (Zermatt)|Schwarzsee]] cable car up from Zermatt, hike up to the [[H\u00f6rnli Hut]] elev. {{convert|3260|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a large stone building at the base of the main ridge, and spend the night. The next day, climbers rise at 3:30 am so as to reach the summit and descend before the regular afternoon clouds and storms come in. The [[Solvay Hut]] located on the ridge at {{convert|4003|m|ft|abbr=on}} can be used only in a case of emergency.\n\nOther popular routes on the mountain include the Italian (Lion) ridge (AD+ Difficulty rating) and the Zmutt ridge (D Difficulty rating). The four faces, as well as the Furggen ridge, constitute the most challenging routes to the summit. The north face is amongst the six [[great north faces of the Alps|most difficult faces of the Alps]], as well as \u2018The Trilogy\u2019, the three hardest of the six, along with the north faces of the [[Eiger]] and the [[Grandes Jorasses]] (TD+ Difficulty rating).\n\nOvercrowding on the several routes have become an issue and guides and local authorities have struggled with how to regulate the numbers.

He approached the Matterhorn as a student when in his Alpine travels he reached the summit of the [[Theodul Pass]] but he does not seem to have paid any particular attention to the mountain itself.<ref name = TheMatterhorn>Rey, Guido, The Matterhorn (translated J. E. C. Eaton), London, 1908. Available on the [https://archive.org/details/matterhorn00eatogoog Internet Archive]</ref>\n\n[[File:Passo-Teodulo.jpg|thumb|''Theodulpass'', c. 1800]]\nThe Matterhorn remained unstudied for more than two centuries, until a geologist from Geneva, [[Horace Benedict de Saussure]], travelled to the mountain, which filled him with admiration. However, de Saussure was not moved to climb the mountain, and had no hope of measuring its altitude by taking a barometer to its summit. \"Its precipitous sides,\" he wrote, \"which give no hold to the very snows, are such as to afford no means of access.\" Yet his scientific interest was kindled by \"the proud peak which rises to so vast an altitude, like a triangular obelisk, that seems to be carved by a chisel.\" His mind intuitively grasped the causes which gave the peak its present precipitous form: the Matterhorn was not like a perfected crystal; the centuries had laboured to destroy a great part of an ancient and much larger mountain. On his first journey de Saussure had come from Ayas to the Col des Cimes Blanches, from where the Matterhorn first comes into view; descending to Breuil, he ascended to the Theodul Pass. On his second journey, in 1792, he came to the [[Valtournanche]], studying and describing it; he ascended to the Theodul Pass, where he spent three days, analysing the structure of the Matterhorn, whose height he was the first to measure, and collecting stones, plants and insects. He made careful observations, from the sparse lichen that clung to the rocks to the tiny but vigorous glacier fly that fluttered over the snows and whose existence at such heights was mysterious. At night he took refuge under the tent erected near the ruins of an old fort at the top of the pass. During these days he climbed the [[Klein Matterhorn]] (3,883 metres), which he named the ''Cime Brune du Breithorn''.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n\nThe first inquirers began to come to the Matterhorn. There is a record of a party of Englishmen who in the summer of 1800 crossed the [[Great St. Bernard Pass]], a few months after the passage of [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]]; they came to Aosta and thence to [[Valtournenche]], slept at the chalets of [[Breuil-Cervinia|Breuil]], and traversed the [[Theodul Pass]], which they called ''Monte Rosa''. The Matterhorn was to them an object of the most intense and continuous admiration.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n\n[[File:Compton, 1879, Matterhorn.jpg|thumb|left|''The Matterhorn'' by [[Edward Theodore Compton]], 1879]]\nThe Matterhorn is mentioned in a guide-book to Switzerland by [[Johann Gottfried Ebel]], which was published in Z\u00fcrich towards the end of the eighteenth century, and translated into English in 1818. The mountain appeared in it under the three names of ''Silvius'', ''Matterhorn'', and ''Mont Cervin'', and was briefly described as one of the most splendid and wonderful obelisks in the Alps. On [[Zermatt]] there was a note: \"A place which may, perhaps, interest the tourist is the valley of Praborgne (Zermatt); it is bounded by huge glaciers which come right down into the valley; the village of Praborgne is fairly high, and stands at a great height above the glaciers; its climate is almost as warm as that of Italy, and plants belonging to hot countries are to be found there at considerable altitudes, above the ice.\"<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n\n[[William Brockedon]], who came to the region in 1825, considered the crossing of the Theodul Pass from Breuil to Zermatt a difficult undertaking. He gave, however, expression to his enthusiasm on the summit. When he arrived exhausted on the top of the pass, he gazed \"on the beautiful pyramid of the Cervin, more wonderful than aught else in sight, rising from its bed of ice to a height of 5,000 feet, a spectacle of indescribable grandeur.\" In this \"immense natural amphitheatre, enclosed from time immemorial by snow-clad mountains and glaciers ever white, in the presence of these grand walls the mind is overwhelmed, not indeed that it is unable to contemplate the scene, but it staggers under the immensity of those objects which it contemplates.\"\n\nThose who made their way up through the Valtournanche to the foot of the mountain were few in number. [[W. A. B. Coolidge]], a diligent collector of old and new stories of the Alps, mentions that during those years, besides Brockedon, only Hirzel-Escher of Z\u00fcrich, who crossed the Theodul Pass in 1822, starting from Breuil, accompanied by a local guide. The greater number came from the [[Valais]] up the [[Visp]] valley to [[Zermatt]]. In 1813, a Frenchman, Henri Maynard, climbed to the Theodul Pass and made the first ascent of the [[Breithorn]]; he was accompanied by numerous guides, among them J. M. Couttet of Chamonix, the same man who had gone with de Saussure to the top of the [[Klein Matterhorn]] in 1792.\nThe writings of these pioneers make much mention of the Matterhorn; the bare and inert rock is gradually quickened into life by men's enthusiasm. \"Stronger minds,\" remarked [[Edward Whymper]], \"felt the influence of the wonderful form, and men who ordinarily spoke or wrote like rational beings, when they came under its power seemed to quit their senses, and ranted and rhapsodised, losing for a time all common forms of speech.\"<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n\nAmong the poets of the Matterhorn during these years (1834 to 1840) were [[Elie de Beaumont]], a famous French geologist; [[Pierre Jean \u00c9douard Desor]], a naturalist of Neuch\u00e2tel, who went up there with a party of friends, two of whom were [[Louis Agassiz]] and [[Bernhard Studer]]. Christian Moritz Engelhardt, who was so filled with admiration for Zermatt and its neighbourhood that he returned there at least ten times (from 1835 to 1855), described these places in two valuable volumes, drew panoramas and maps, and collected the most minute notes on the mineralogy and botany of the region. Zermatt was at that time a quiet little village, and travellers found hospitality at the parish priest's, or at the village doctor's.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n[[File:Matterhorn Ruskin.jpeg|thumb|''The Matterhorn'' by [[John Ruskin]], 1849]]\n\nIn 1841 [[James David Forbes]], professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, came to see the Matterhorn. A philosopher and geologist, and an observant traveller, he continued the work of De Saussure in his journeys and his writings. He was full of admiration for the Matterhorn, calling it the most wonderful peak in the Alps, unsealed and unscalable. These words, pronounced by a man noted among all his contemporaries for his thorough knowledge of mountains, show what men's feelings then were towards the Matterhorn, and how at a time when the idea of [[Exploration of the High Alps|Alpine exploration]] was gaining ground in their minds, the Matterhorn stood by itself as a mountain apart, of whose conquest it was vain even to dream. And such it remained till long after this; as such it was described by [[John Ball (naturalist)|John Ball]] twenty years later in his celebrated guide-book. Forbes ascended the Theodul Pass in 1842, climbed the Breithorn, and came down to Breuil; as he descended from the savage scenery of the Matterhorn, the Italian landscapes of the Valtournanche seemed to him like paradise. Meanwhile [[Gottlieb Samuel Studer]], the geographer, together with Melchior Ulrich, was describing and mapping the topographical features of the Zermatt peaks.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/><ref>Sydney Spencer,''Mountaineering'', p. 27, 1934</ref>\n\n[[Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer]], who first accompanied and guided youth to the Alps for purposes of education and amusement, began his journeys in 1832, but it is only in 1840 that he mentions the Matterhorn. Two years later T\u00f6pffer and his pupils came to Zermatt. He has described this journey of his in a chapter entitled ''Voyage autour du Mont Blanc jusqu'\u00e0 Zermatt'', here he sings a hymn of praise to the Matterhorn, comparing its form with a \"huge crystal of a hundred facets, flashing varied hues, that softly reflects the light, unshaded, from the uttermost depths of the heavens\". T\u00f6pffer's book was illustrated by [[Alexandre Calame]], his master and friend, with drawings of the Matterhorn, executed in the romantic style of the period. It is an artificial mountain, a picture corresponding rather with the exaggerated effect it produces on the astonished mind of the artist, than with the real form of the mountain.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n\nAbout this time there came a man who studied the Matterhorn in its structure and form, and who sketched it and described it in all its parts with the curiosity of the artist and the insight of the scientist. This was [[John Ruskin]], a new and original type of philosopher and geologist, painter and poet, whom England was enabled to create during that period of radical intellectual reforms, which led the way for the highest development of her civilisation. Ruskin was the Matterhorn's poet par excellence. He went to Zermatt in 1844, and it is to be noticed as a curious fact, that the first time he saw the Matterhorn it did not please him. The mountain on its lofty pedestal in the very heart of the Alps was, perhaps, too far removed from the ideal he had formed of the mountains; but he returned, studied and dreamt for long at its feet, and at length he pronounced it \"the most noble cliff in Europe.\" Ruskin was no mountaineer, nor a great friend to mountaineering; he drew sketches of the mountains merely as an illustration of his teaching of the beauty of natural forms, which was the object of his whole life. In his work on Modern Painters he makes continual use of the mountains as an example of beauty and an incentive to morality. The publication of Ruskin's work certainly produced a great impression at the time on educated people in England, and a widespread desire to see the mountains.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n\n{{quote|It is a fragment of some size; a group of broken walls, one of them overhanging; crowned with a cornice, nodding some hundred and fifty feet over its massive flank, three thousand above its glacier base, and fourteen thousand above the sea, \u2014 a wall truly of some majesty, at once the most precipitous and the strongest mass in the whole chain of the Alps, the Mont Cervin.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>}}\n\n[[File:Spelterini Matterhorn 1910.jpg|thumb|Aerial photography by [[Eduard Spelterini]] in 1910]]\nOther men of high attainments followed, but in the years 1850 scientists and artists were about to be succeeded by real climbers and the passes and peaks around Zermatt were explored little by little. In the preface to the first volume of the ''[[Alpine Journal]]'', which appeared in 1863, the editor [[Hereford Brooke George]] wrote that: \"While even if all other objects of interest in Switzerland should be exhausted, the Matterhorn remains (who shall say for how long?) unconquered and apparently invincible.\"Whymper successfully reached the summit in 1865, but four men perished on the descent. The English papers discussed it with bitter words of blame; a German newspaper published an article in which Whymper was accused of cutting the rope between Douglas and Taugwalder, at the critical moment, to save his own life.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n\nIn 1890 the Federal Government was asked simultaneously by the same contractor for a concession for the [[Gornergrat railway|Zermatt-Gornergrat railway]], and for a Zermatt-Matterhorn one. The Gornergrat railway was constructed, and has been working since 1899, but there has been no more talk of the other. The project essentially consisted of a line which went up to the H\u00f6rnli, and continued thence in a rectilinear tunnel about two kilometres long, built under the ridge, and issuing near the summit on the Zmutt side.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/> Sixty years later in 1950, Italian engineer Count Dino Lora Totino planned a cable car on the Italian side from Breuil-Cervinia to the summit. But the Alpine Museum of Zermatt sent a protest letter with 90,000 signatures to the Italian government. The latter declared the Matterhorn a natural wonder worthy of protection and refused the concession to the engineer.<ref>[http://www.merian.de/reiseziele/artikel/a-698707-2.html Trag\u00f6dien am Matterhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723010555/http://www.merian.de/reiseziele/artikel/a-698707-2.html |date=2011-07-23 }}, Johannes Schweikle, Merian.de</ref>\n\nDuring the 20th century, the Matterhorn and the story of the first ascent in particular, inspired various artists and film producers such as [[Luis Trenker]] and [[Walt Disney]].<ref>Hans-Michael Bock, Tim Bergfelder, ''The Concise Cinegraph: Encyclopaedia of German Cinema'', p. 480</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://michaelbarrier.com/Essays/EuropeanJournal_Zermatt/europeanjournal_zermatt.htm|title=MichaelBarrier.com -- Essays: Zermatt|website=michaelbarrier.com}}</ref> Large-scale replicas can be found at [[Matterhorn Bobsleds|Disneyland]] and [[Window of the World]].\n\nDesigned in 1908 by Emil Cardinaux, a leading poster artist of the time, the [[:File:Emil Cardinaux-Zermatt.jpg|Matterhorn affiche]] for the Zermatt tourist office is often considered the first modern poster.

Three of them (north, east and west) are on the Swiss side of the border and watershed ([[Mattertal]] valley) and one of them (south) is on the Italian side of the border ([[Valtournenche]] valley). The north face overlooks the [[Ober Gabelhorn]] (7&nbsp;km away) across the [[Zmutt Glacier]] and valley (above [[Zermatt]]), the east face overlooks the [[Gorner Glacier]] system between the [[Gornergrat]] and [[Monte Rosa]] (respectively 10 and 17&nbsp;km away) across the [[Theodul Pass]], the west face overlooks the upper basin of the Zmutt Glacier between the [[Dent Blanche]] and the [[Dent d'H\u00e9rens]] (respectively 7 and 4&nbsp;km away) and the south face fronts the resort town of [[Breuil-Cervinia]] and overlooks a good portion of the Valtournenche. The Matterhorn does not form a perfect [[square pyramid]], as the north and south faces are wider than the west and east faces. Moreover, the latter faces do not actually meet on the summit but are connected by a 100-metre-long horizontal west\u2013east ridge between the north and south faces.\n\nThe Matterhorn's faces are steep, and only small patches of snow and ice cling to them; regular [[avalanche]]s send the snow down to accumulate on the [[glacier]]s at the base of each face, the largest of which are the Tiefmattengletscher to the west, part of the [[Zmutt Glacier]], and the [[Matterhorn Glacier]] to the north. Smaller glaciers lie at the base of the south face (the Lower Matterhorn Glacier) and the east face (unnamed). In this area, the border between Switzerland and Italy coincides with the [[Main chain of the Alps|main Alpine watershed]], separating the [[drainage basin]] of the [[Rhone]] on the north ([[Mediterranean Sea]]) and that of the [[Po (river)|Po]] on the south ([[Adriatic Sea]]). The north side is drained by the Zmuttbach (west and north faces) and the Gornera through the Furggbach (east face), tributaries of the Rhone through the (Matter) Vispa.<ref>The Vispa, formed by the Matter Vispa and Saaser Vispa, runs only a few kilometres before its ends in the Rhone.</ref> The south side and face is drained by the Marmore torrent, tributary of the Po through the [[Dora Baltea]] (or ''Doire balt\u00e9e''). The [[Theodul Pass]], located on the watershed between the Matterhorn and the [[Breithorn]], at 3,295 metres, is the easiest passage between the two valleys and countries (the slightly lower Furggjoch not being used as a pass). The pass was used as a crossover and trade route for the Romans and the Romanised Celtic population ''[[Salassi]]'' between 100 BCE and 400 CE.<ref>[http://zermatt.gadmin.ch/files/?id=18556 Key dates in the history of Zermatt]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on 2009-10-19</ref> The area is now heavily glaciated and covered on the north side by the [[Theodul Glacier]].\n\nWell-known faces are the east and north, visible from the area of Zermatt, although mostly hidden from the Mattertal by the chain of the [[Weisshorn]]. The east face is 1,000 metres high and, because it is \"a long, monotonous slope of rotten rocks\",<ref name=Collomb>Robin G. Collomb, ''Pennine Alps Central'', London: Alpine Club, 1975, pp. 241\u201359</ref> presents a high risk of rockfall, making its ascent dangerous. The north face is 1,200 metres high and is one of the [[Great north faces of the Alps|most dangerous north faces in the Alps]], in particular for its risk of rockfall and storms. The south face, well visible from the Valtournenche, is 1,350 metres high and offers many different routes. The west face, the highest at 1,400 metres, has the fewest ascent routes and lies in a more remote area than the other faces.\n\nThe four main ridges separating the four faces are the main climbing routes. The least difficult technical climb and the usual [[climbing route]], the H\u00f6rnli ridge (''H\u00f6rnligrat''), lies between the east and north faces and is aligned towards the [[Oberrothorn]] above Zermatt. To its west lies the Zmutt ridge (''Zmuttgrat''), between the north and west faces and aligned towards the [[Wandfluehorn]]; this is, according to Collomb, \"the classic route up the mountain, its longest ridge, also the most disjointed.\"<ref name=Collomb/> The ''Lion'' ridge (''Cresta del Leone'' / ''Ar\u00eate du lion''), lying between the south and west faces and aligned towards the Dent d'H\u00e9rens is the Italian normal route and goes across [[Pic Tyndall]]; Collomb comments, \"A superb rock ridge, the shortest on the mountain, now draped with many fixed ropes, but a far superior climb compared with the H\u00f6rnli.\"<ref name=Collomb/> Finally the south side is separated from the east side by the Furggen ridge (''Furggengrat''), which is aligned towards the [[Klein Matterhorn]]. It is, according to Collomb, \"the hardest of the ridges [...] the ridge still has an awesome reputation but is not too difficult in good conditions by the indirect finish\".<ref name=Collomb/>\n\nWhile the Matterhorn is the culminating point of the Valtournenche on the south, it is only one of the many [[List of Alpine four-thousanders|4000 metres summits]] of the Mattertal valley on the north. Its height is exceeded by four major summits<!--300 m prominence summits only are listed below-->: the [[Weisshorn]] (4,505 m), the [[Dom (mountain)|Dom]] (4,545 m), the [[Liskamm]] (4,527 m) and the second highest in the Alps, [[Monte Rosa]] (4,634 m). This section of the [[Pennine Alps]], including the Matterhorn, the [[Zinalrothorn]], the [[Dent Blanche]], the [[Dent d'H\u00e9rens]], the [[Breithorn]], the [[Strahlhorn]], the [[Rimpfischhorn]] and the [[Alphubel]], concentrates most of western Europe's highest mountains and forms a crown of peaks around Zermatt.

Because of its position on the main Alpine [[Drainage divide|watershed]] and its great height, the Matterhorn is exposed to rapid weather changes. In addition, the steep faces of the mountain and its isolated location make it prone to [[Orographic lift|banner clouds]] formation, with the air flowing around the mountain producing condensation of the air on the lee side and also creating vortices.\n\n==Geology==\n{{see also|Geology of the Alps}}\nApart from the base of the mountain, the Matterhorn is composed of [[gneiss]] belonging to the [[Dent Blanche klippe]], an isolated part of the [[Austroalpine nappes]], lying over the [[Penninic nappes]]. The Austroalpine nappes are part of the [[Apulian plate]], a small continent which broke up from Africa before the [[Alpine orogeny]]. For this reason the Matterhorn has been popularized as an African mountain. The Austroalpine nappes are mostly common in the Eastern Alps.\n\nThe Swiss explorer and geologist [[Horace-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure]], inspired by the view of the Matterhorn, anticipated the modern theories of geology:\n\n{{Quotation|What power must have been required to shatter and to sweep away the missing parts of this pyramid; for we do not see it surrounded by heaps of fragments; one only sees other peaks - themselves rooted to the ground - whose sides, equally rent, indicate an immense mass of d\u00e9bris, of which we do not see any trace in the neighbourhood. Doubtless this is that d\u00e9bris which, in the form of pebbles, boulders, and sand, fills our valleys and our plains.<ref>Edward Whymper, ''Scrambles amongst the Alps'', 6th edition, London: John Murray, 1936, p. 80</ref>}}\n\n===Formation===\n[[Image:Matterhorn002.jpg|thumb|Different layers of rock can be seen: the lower part is [[sedimentary rock]] (brown); the middle part is [[greenschist]] from the oceanic crust. The peak itself is [[gneiss]] from the African continent.]]\n\nThe formation of the Matterhorn (and the whole Alpine range) started with the break-up of the [[Pangaea]] continent 200 million years ago into [[Laurasia]] (containing Europe) and [[Gondwana]] (containing Africa). While the rocks constituting the nearby [[Monte Rosa]] remained in Laurasia, the rocks constituting the Matterhorn found themselves in Gondwana, separated by the newly formed [[Tethys Ocean]].\n\n100 million years ago the extension of the Tethys Ocean stopped and the Apulian plate broke from Gondwana and moved toward the European continent. This resulted in the closure of the western Tethys by [[subduction]] under the Apulian plate (with the [[Piemont-Liguria Ocean]] first and [[Valais Ocean]] later). The subduction of the oceanic crust left traces still visible today at the base of the Matterhorn ([[accretionary prism]]). The orogeny itself began after the end of the oceanic subduction when the European continental crust collided with the Apulian continent, resulting in the formation of [[nappe]]s.\nThe Matterhorn acquired its characteristic pyramidal shape in much more recent times as it was caused by natural erosion over the past million years. At the beginning of alpine orogeny, the Matterhorn was only a rounded mountain like a hill. Because its height is above the [[snowline]], its flanks are covered by ice, resulting from the accumulation and compaction of snow. During the warmer period of summer, part of the ice melts and seeps into the bedrock. When it freezes again, it fractures pieces of rock because of its dilatation ([[freeze-thaw]]), forming a [[cirque]]. Four cirques led to the shape of the mountain. Because of its recognizable shape, many other similar mountains around the world were named or nicknamed the 'Matterhorn' of their respective countries or mountain ranges.<ref>[http://www.cervintopmodel.com/news/jouty.html A list of 109 world 'Matterhorns' CERVIN top model des Alpes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017120656/http://cervintopmodel.com/news/jouty.html |date=2007-10-17 }} Retrieved 15 October 2007 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref>\n\n===Rocks===\nMost of the base of the mountain lies in the Tsat\u00e9 nappe, a remnant of the Piedmont-Liguria oceanic crust ([[ophiolites]]) and its sedimentary rocks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/RSTGV/00161/RSTGV-A-00161.pdf|title=The Matterhorn - Really from Africa?}}</ref> Up to 3,400 metres the mountain is composed of successive layers of ophiolites and [[sedimentary rock]]s.

The Matterhorn remained relatively little known until 1865, but the successful ascent followed by the tragic accident of the expedition led by [[Edward Whymper]] caused a rush on the mountains surrounding [[Zermatt]].\n\nThe construction of the railway linking the village of Zermatt from the town of [[Visp]] started in 1888. The first train reached Zermatt on July 18, 1891 and the entire line was electrified in 1930.<ref>[http://www.mgbahn.ch/anotrepropos/histoire/bvzzermatt-bahn.php Histoire du BVZ Zermatt-Bahn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021081309/http://www.mgbahn.ch/anotrepropos/histoire/bvzzermatt-bahn.php |date=2007-10-21 }} mgbahn.ch.

However there is no connection with the village of [[Breuil-Cervinia]] on the Italian side. Travellers have to hire mountain guides to cross the 3,300-metre-high glaciated [[Theodul Pass]], separating the two resorts. The town of Zermatt remains almost completely free of internal combustion vehicles and can be reached by train only. (Apart from the local police service which uses a Volkswagen car, only electric vehicles are used locally).\n\n[[File:2007 Matterhorn.jpg|thumb|upright|left|View from the train to the Gornergrat]]\n\nRail and cable-car facilities have been built to make some of the summits in the area more accessible. The [[Gornergrat railway]], reaching a record altitude of 3,100 metres, was inaugurated in 1898. Areas served by cable car are the [[Unterrothorn]] and the [[Klein Matterhorn]] (''Little Matterhorn'') (3,883 m, highest transportation system in Europe). The [[H\u00f6rnli Hut]] (3,260 m), which is the start of the normal route via the H\u00f6rnli ridge, is easily accessible from [[Schwarzsee (Zermatt)|Schwarzsee]] (2,600 m) and is also frequented by hikers. The Zermatt and Breuil-Cervinia resorts function as separate ski resort all year round and are connected by skilifts over the Theodul Pass. In 2015 it was expected that there would be constructed a cable car link between Testa Grigia (or ''T\u00eate grise'') and Klein Matterhorn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.matterhornparadise.ch/en/Company/Investments-and-projects|title=Investments and projects : Matterhorn - Zermatt|website=www.matterhornparadise.ch}}</ref> It will finally provide a link between the Swiss and Italian side of the Matterhorn.<ref>[http://www.zermatt.ch/en/page.cfm/lifts_and_pistes/zermatt_bergbahnen_ag/projects Zermatt Bergbahnen AG, Projects] Retrieved on 2009-10-22</ref>\n\nThe [[Matterhorn Museum]] (Zermatt) relates the general history of the region from alpinism to tourism. In the museum, which is in the form of a reconstituted mountain village, the visitors can relive the first and tragic ascent of the Matterhorn and see the objects having belonged to the protagonists.\n\nThe Tour of the Matterhorn can be effected by trekkers in about 10 days. Considered by some as one of the most beautiful treks in the Alps, it follows many ancient trails that have linked the Swiss and Italian valleys for centuries. The circuit includes alpine meadows, balcony trails, larch forests and glacial crossings. It connects six valleys embracing three different cultures: the German-speaking high Valais, the French-speaking central Valais and the bilingual French/Italian-speaking Aosta Valley. Good conditions are necessary to circumnavigate the peak. After reaching [[Zinal]] from Zermatt by the Augstbord and Meiden passes, the trekker crosses the Col de Sorebois and the Col de Torrent before arriving at [[Arolla]]. Then the [[Arolla Glacier]] and the [[Col Collon]] must be crossed on the way to [[Prarayer]], followed by the Col de Valcournera to Breuil-Cervinia. In the last and highest section, the [[Theodul Pass]] must be crossed before returning to Zermatt. In total, seven passes between 2,800 and 3,300 metres must be crossed on a relatively difficult terrain.<ref>Hilary Sharp, ''Tour of the Matterhorn'', Cicerone</ref>\n\nAs of 2015 almost two million visitors arrive at Zermatt annually.

The first serious attempts were all from the Italian side, although despite appearances the southern routes are technically harder.

Upon descent, Hadow, Croz, Hudson and Douglas fell to their deaths on the [[Matterhorn Glacier]], and all but Douglas (whose body was never found) are buried in the Zermatt churchyard.\n\nJust three days later, on July 17, 1865, Jean-Antoine Carrel and [[Jean-Baptiste Bich]] reached the summit from the Italian side.<ref name=Collomb/>\n\n=== Before the first ascent ===\nIn the summer of 1860, Edward Whymper came across the Matterhorn for the first time. He was an English artist and engraver who had been hired by a London publisher to make sketches of the mountains in the region of [[Zermatt]]. Although the unclimbed Matterhorn had a mixed reputation among British mountaineers, it fascinated Whymper. Whymper's first attempt was in August 1861, from the village of [[Breuil-Cervinia|Breuil]] on the south side. In [[Chatillon, Aosta Valley|Ch\u00e2tillon]] he hired a Swiss guide, who remained anonymous in his accounts, and in Valtournanche he almost hired Jean-Antoine Carrel as well, but, disliking the looks of Carrel's uncle, he changed his mind.<ref name = taotm/> The Carrels decided to give Matterhorn a try by themselves again, and caught up with Whymper at nightfall. Whymper now had \"a strong inclination to engage the pair; but, finally, decided against it\" and the Carrels went alone to reach a new high on Matterhorn of {{convert|4032|m|abbr=on}} the next day. Whymper and his guide camped one more night on the ''Col du lion'' (= Col Tournanche) {{convert|3479|m|abbr=on}} and were forced to turn around only an hour above this pass the day after.<ref name = taotm/>\n\n[[File:Rifugio Carrel.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Refuge Jean-Antoine Carrel|Carrel Hut]] (3,830 m) on the Lion ridge]]\n\nIn 1862 Whymper made further attempts, still from the south side, on the Lion ridge (or Italian ridge), where the route seemed easier than the H\u00f6rnli ridge (the normal route today). On his own he reached above 4,000 metres, but was injured on his way down to Breuil. In July [[John Tyndall]] with Johann Joseph Bennen and another guide overcame most of the difficulties of the ridge that seemed so formidable from below and [[Pic Tyndall|successfully reached the main shoulder]]; but at a point not very far below the summit they were stopped by a deep cleft that defied their utmost efforts. The Matterhorn remained unclimbed.\n\nWhymper returned to Breuil in 1863, persuading Carrel to join forces with him and try the mountain once more via the Italian ridge. On this attempt, however, a storm soon developed and they were stuck halfway to the summit. They remained there for 26 hours in their tent before giving up. Whymper did not make another attempt for two years.\n\nIn the decisive year 1865, Whymper returned with new plans, deciding to attack the Matterhorn via its south face instead of the Italian ridge. On June 21, Whymper began his ascent with Swiss guides, but halfway up they experienced severe rockfall; although nobody was injured, they decided to give up the ascent. This was Whymper's seventh attempt.\n\nDuring the following weeks, Whymper spent his time climbing other mountains in the area with his guides, before going back to Breuil on July 7. Meanwhile the [[Italian Alpine Club]] was founded and its leaders, [[Felice Giordano]] and [[Quintino Sella]], established plans to conquer the Matterhorn before any non-Italian could succeed. Felice Giordano hired Carrel as a guide. He feared the arrival of Whymper, now a rival, and wrote to Quintino Sella:<ref>Roger W. Patillo, ''The Canadian Rockies: Pioneers, Legends and True Tales'', p. 176</ref>\n{{quote|I have tried to keep everything secret, but that fellow whose life seems to depend on the Matterhorn is here, suspiciously prying into everything. I have taken all the best men away from him; and yet he is so enamored of the mountain that he may go with others...He is here in the hotel and I try to avoid speaking to him.}}\n\n[[File:Matterhorn from the south.jpg|thumb|The Matterhorn seen from the [[Valtournenche]] Valley]]\n\nJust as he did two years before, Whymper asked Carrel to be his guide, but Carrel declined; Whymper was also unsuccessful in hiring other local guides from Breuil. When Whymper discovered Giordano and Carrel's plan, he left Breuil and crossed the [[Theodul Pass]] to Zermatt to hire local guides. He encountered [[Lord Francis Douglas]], a Scottish mountaineer, who also wanted to climb the Matterhorn. They arrived later in Zermatt in the [[Monte Rosa Hotel]], where they met two other British climbers \u2014 the [[Charles Hudson (climber)|Reverend Charles Hudson]] and his young and inexperienced companion, [[Douglas Robert Hadow]] \u2014 who had hired the French guide [[Michel Croz]] to try to make the first ascent. These two groups decided to join forces and try the ascent of the H\u00f6rnli ridge. They hired another two local guides, a father and son, both named Peter Taugwalder.\n\n=== First ascent ===\n{{main|First ascent of the Matterhorn}}\nWhymper and party left Zermatt early in the morning of July 13, 1865, heading to the foot of the H\u00f6rnli ridge, which they reached 6 hours later (approximately where the H\u00f6rnli Hut is situated today). Meanwhile Carrel and six other Italian guides also began their ascent of the Italian ridge.\n\nDespite its appearance, Whymper wrote that the H\u00f6rnli ridge was much easier to climb than the Italian ridge:\n{{quote|We were now fairly upon the mountain, and were astonished to find that places which from the Riffel, or even from the Furggen Glacier, looked entirely impracticable, were so easy that we could ''run about''.<ref name=Whymper>Edward Whymper, ''Scrambles amongst the Alps'', 6th edition, London: John Murray, 1936, pp. 309\u201313</ref>}}\n[[Image:Matterhorn ascent Dore.jpg|thumb|upright|The first ascent of the Matterhorn, by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]]]\nAfter camping for the night, Whymper and party started on the ridge. According to Whymper:\n{{quote|The whole of this great slope was now revealed, rising for 3,000 feet like a huge natural staircase. Some parts were more, and others were less, easy; but we were not once brought to a halt by any serious impediment, for when an obstruction was met in front it could always be turned to the right or left. For the greater part of the way there was, indeed, no occasion for the rope, and sometimes Hudson led, sometimes myself. At 6.20 we had attained a height of 12,800 feet and halted for half an hour; we then continued the ascent without a break until 9.55, when we stopped for fifty minutes, at a height of 14,000 feet.<ref name=Whymper/>}}\nWhen the party came close to the summit, they had to leave the ridge for the north face because \"[the ridge] was usually more rotten and steep, and always more difficult than the face\".<ref name=Whymper/> At this point of the ascent Whymper wrote that the less experienced Hadow \"required continual assistance\".<ref name=Whymper/> Having overcome these difficulties the group finally arrived in the summit area, with Croz and Whymper reaching the top first.\n{{quote|The slope eased off, and Croz and I, dashing away, ran a neck-and-neck race, which ended in a dead heat. At 1.40 p.m. the world was at our feet, and the Matterhorn was conquered. Hurrah! Not a footstep could be seen.<ref name=Whymper/>}}\nPrecisely at this moment, Carrel and party were approximatively 400 metres below, still dealing with the most difficult parts of the Italian ridge. When seeing his rival on the summit, Carrel and party gave up on their attempt and went back to Breuil.\n[[Image:Matterhorn disaster Dore.jpg|thumb|upright|The first descent of the Matterhorn, by Gustave Dor\u00e9]]\nAfter building a [[cairn]], Whymper and party stayed an hour on the summit. Then they began their descent of the H\u00f6rnli ridge. Croz descended first, then Hadow, Hudson and Douglas, the elder Taugwalder, Whymper, with the younger Taugwalder coming last. They climbed down with great care, only one man moving at a time. Whymper wrote:\n\n{{quote|As far as I know, at the moment of the accident no one was actually moving. I cannot speak with certainty, neither can the Taugwalders, because the two leading men were partially hidden from our sight by an intervening mass of rock. Poor Croz had laid aside his axe, and in order to give Mr. Hadow greater security was absolutely taking hold of his legs and putting his feet, one by one, into their proper positions. From the movements of their shoulders it is my belief that Croz, having done as I have said, was in the act of turning round to go down a step or two himself; at this moment Mr. Hadow slipped, fell on him, and knocked him over.<ref>''The Times'' 08-08-1865, p 9</ref>}}\n\nThe weight of the falling men pulled Hudson and Douglas from their holds and dragged them down the north face. The Taugwalders and Whymper were left alive when the rope linking Douglas to the elder Taugwalder broke. They were stunned by the accident and for a time could not move until the younger Taugwalder descended to enable them to advance. When they were together Whymper asked to see the broken rope and saw that it had been employed by mistake as it was the weakest and oldest of the three ropes they had brought. They frantically looked, but in vain, for traces of their fallen companions. They continued their descent, including an hour in the dark, until 9.30 p.m. when a resting place was found. At daybreak the descent was resumed and the group finally reached Zermatt, where a search of the victims was quickly organized. The bodies of Croz, Hadow and Hudson were found on the [[Matterhorn Glacier]], but the body of Douglas was never found. Although the elder Taugwalder was accused of cutting the rope to save himself and his son, the official inquest found no proof of this.\n\n===Second ascent===\n{{Main|Second ascent of the Matterhorn}}\n[[File:Le Cervin.jpg|thumb|left|South-west side of the Matterhorn ([[Pic Tyndall|Tyndall shoulder]] on the foreground)]]\nOn July 16, two days after the first ascent and the catastrophe, [[Jean-Antoine Carrel]] set out to crown Whymper's victory by proving that the Italian side was not unconquerable. He was accompanied by [[Am\u00e9 Gorret]], a priest who had shared with him the first attempt on the mountain back in 1857. Jean-Baptiste Bich and Jean-Augustin Meynet completed the party. [[Felice Giordano|Giordano]] would have joined them, but Carrel refused absolutely to take him with them; he said he would not have the strength to guide a traveller, and could neither answer for the result nor for any one's life. After hearing Sunday mass at the chapel of Breuil, the party started. Am\u00e9 Gorret has described this ascent with enthusiasm: \"At last we crossed the Col du Lion and set foot upon the pyramid of the Matterhorn!\" On the following day, the 17th, they continued the ascent and reached Tyndall's flagstaff. \"We were about to enter unknown country,\" wrote Gorret, \"for no man had gone beyond this point.\" Here opinions were divided; Gorret suggested ascending by the ridge and scaling the last tower straight up. Carrel was inclined to traverse to the west of the peak, and thence go up on the Zmutt side. Naturally the wish of Carrel prevailed, for he was the leader and had not lost the habit of command, notwithstanding his recent defeat.<ref name = Rey>Guido Rey, ''The Matterhorn'' (translated J. E. C. Eaton), London, 1908, p. 140</ref>\n\nThey made the passage of the ''enjamb\u00e9e'', and traversed the west face to reach the Zmutt ridge. A false step made by one of the party and a fall of icicles from above warned them to return to the direct line of ascent, and the traverse back to the Lion ridge was one of the greatest difficulty. A falling stone injured Gorret in the arm.<ref name = Rey/>\n\nAt last they reached the base of the final tower. \"We stood,\" wrote Gorret, \"in a place that was almost comfortable. Although it was not more than two yards wide, and the slope was one of 75 percent, we gave it all kinds of pleasant names : the corridor, the gallery, the railroad, &c., &c.\" They imagined all difficulties were at an end; but a rock [[couloir]], which they had hitherto not observed, lay between them and the final bit of ridge, where progress would be perfectly easy. It would have been unwise for all four to descend into the couloir, because they did not know where to fix the rope that would be needed on their return. Time pressed: it was necessary to reduce the numbers of the party; Gorret sacrificed himself, and Meynet stopped with him. Very soon afterwards Carrel and Bich were finally on the top. Meanwhile Giordano at Breuil was writing in his diary as follows: \"Splendid weather; at 9.30 saw Carrel and his men on the Shoulder, after that saw nothing more of them. Then much mist about the summit. Lifted a bit about 3.30, and we saw our flag on the western summit of the Matterhorn.\"<ref name = Rey/>\n\n=== Other ascents ===\n\n====Ridges====\n{{Multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 220\n | image1 = Matterhorn - Zmuttgrat.jpg\n | caption1 = The north and west faces with the snowy Zmutt ridge in the centre\n | image2 = Zmutt ridge.jpg\n | caption2 = View from the ridge ({{circa|3,900 m}})\n}}\n\nThe first direct ascent of the Italian (south-west) ridge as it is climbed today was by J.

In fact, several climbers die each year due to a number of factors including the scale of the climb and its inherent dangers, inexperience, falling rocks, and overcrowded routes. The Matterhorn is thus amongst the deadliest mountains in the world. By the late 1980s, it was estimated that over 500 people have died whilst attempting its summit since the 1865 ascent, with an average of about 12 deaths each year.<ref>{{cite book |last=Black |first=Lee |date=2014 |title=Mountaineering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsRxAgAAQBAJ |location=[[Edina, Minnesota|Edina, United States]] |publisher=ABDO Publishing Company |page=29 |isbn=9781629680101}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2000s, there was a trend of fewer people dying each year on the mountain.

Whymper\u2019s book about his first ascent, ''Scrambles Amongst the Alps'', published in 1871, was a worldwide bestseller. Tourists began to visit Switzerland in the summer to see the Alps and often hired locals as guides. With the beginning of alpine skiing in the early 20th century, tourists began traveling to Switzerland in winter also. Mountaineering, in part, helped transform Switzerland\u2019s mountain regions from poor rural areas to tourist destinations. This combination of mountain climbing, skiing and tourism, was used in the western United States, creating [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]], [[Vail Ski Resort|Vail]], [[Jackson Hole Mountain Resort|Jackson Hole]], and other mountain towns around the world.<ref>{{cite web|title = How the Matterhorn Created Modern Mountaineering 150 Years Ago|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/07/150714-matterhorn-switzerland-mountaineering-climbing-adventure-world|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-07-15|first = Mark Jenkins PUBLISHED July|last = 14}}</ref>\n\n== Climbing routes ==\n[[File:H\u00f6rnlih\u00fctte weg.jpg|thumb|Trail to the [[H\u00f6rnli Hut]]]]\n\nToday, all ridges and faces of the Matterhorn have been ascended in all seasons, and [[mountain guide]]s take a large number of people up the northeast H\u00f6rnli route each summer. In total, up to 150 climbers attempt the Matterhorn each day during summer. By modern standards, the climb is fairly difficult (AD [[Grade (climbing)|Difficulty rating]]), but not hard for skilled mountaineers according to [[Grade (climbing)#International French Adjectival System (IFAS)|French climbing grades]]. There are [[fixed rope]]s on parts of the route to help. Still, it should be remembered that several climbers may die on the mountain each year.\n\nThe usual pattern of ascent is to take the [[Schwarzsee (Zermatt)|Schwarzsee]] cable car up from Zermatt, hike up to the [[H\u00f6rnli Hut]] elev. {{convert|3260|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a large stone building at the base of the main ridge, and spend the night. The next day, climbers rise at 3:30 am so as to reach the summit and descend before the regular afternoon clouds and storms come in. The [[Solvay Hut]] located on the ridge at {{convert|4003|m|ft|abbr=on}} can be used only in a case of emergency.\n\nOther popular routes on the mountain include the Italian (Lion) ridge (AD+ Difficulty rating) and the Zmutt ridge (D Difficulty rating). The four faces, as well as the Furggen ridge, constitute the most challenging routes to the summit. The north face is amongst the six [[great north faces of the Alps|most difficult faces of the Alps]], as well as \u2018The Trilogy\u2019, the three hardest of the six, along with the north faces of the [[Eiger]] and the [[Grandes Jorasses]] (TD+ Difficulty rating).\n\nOvercrowding on the several routes have become an issue and guides and local authorities have struggled with how to regulate the numbers. In 2015 the H\u00f6rnli hut became the first mountain shelter in Europe to limit beds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/sports/swiss-move-to-reduce-stress-on-the-matterhorn.html|title=Swiss Move to Reduce Stress on the Matterhorn|first=Kelley|last=McMillan|date=July 13, 2015|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n!\n!

He approached the Matterhorn as a student when in his Alpine travels he reached the summit of the [[Theodul Pass]] but he does not seem to have paid any particular attention to the mountain itself.<ref name = TheMatterhorn>Rey, Guido, The Matterhorn (translated J. E. C. Eaton), London, 1908. Available on the [https://archive.org/details/matterhorn00eatogoog Internet Archive]</ref>\n\n[[File:Passo-Teodulo.jpg|thumb|''Theodulpass'', c. 1800]]\nThe Matterhorn remained unstudied for more than two centuries, until a geologist from Geneva, [[Horace Benedict de Saussure]], travelled to the mountain, which filled him with admiration. However, de Saussure was not moved to climb the mountain, and had no hope of measuring its altitude by taking a barometer to its summit. \"Its precipitous sides,\" he wrote, \"which give no hold to the very snows, are such as to afford no means of access.\" Yet his scientific interest was kindled by \"the proud peak which rises to so vast an altitude, like a triangular obelisk, that seems to be carved by a chisel.\" His mind intuitively grasped the causes which gave the peak its present precipitous form: the Matterhorn was not like a perfected crystal; the centuries had laboured to destroy a great part of an ancient and much larger mountain. On his first journey de Saussure had come from Ayas to the Col des Cimes Blanches, from where the Matterhorn first comes into view; descending to Breuil, he ascended to the Theodul Pass. On his second journey, in 1792, he came to the [[Valtournanche]], studying and describing it; he ascended to the Theodul Pass, where he spent three days, analysing the structure of the Matterhorn, whose height he was the first to measure, and collecting stones, plants and insects. He made careful observations, from the sparse lichen that clung to the rocks to the tiny but vigorous glacier fly that fluttered over the snows and whose existence at such heights was mysterious. At night he took refuge under the tent erected near the ruins of an old fort at the top of the pass. During these days he climbed the [[Klein Matterhorn]] (3,883 metres), which he named the ''Cime Brune du Breithorn''.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n\nThe first inquirers began to come to the Matterhorn. There is a record of a party of Englishmen who in the summer of 1800 crossed the [[Great St. Bernard Pass]], a few months after the passage of [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]]; they came to Aosta and thence to [[Valtournenche]], slept at the chalets of [[Breuil-Cervinia|Breuil]], and traversed the [[Theodul Pass]], which they called ''Monte Rosa''. The Matterhorn was to them an object of the most intense and continuous admiration.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n\n[[File:Compton, 1879, Matterhorn.jpg|thumb|left|''The Matterhorn'' by [[Edward Theodore Compton]], 1879]]\nThe Matterhorn is mentioned in a guide-book to Switzerland by [[Johann Gottfried Ebel]], which was published in Z\u00fcrich towards the end of the eighteenth century, and translated into English in 1818. The mountain appeared in it under the three names of ''Silvius'', ''Matterhorn'', and ''Mont Cervin'', and was briefly described as one of the most splendid and wonderful obelisks in the Alps. On [[Zermatt]] there was a note: \"A place which may, perhaps, interest the tourist is the valley of Praborgne (Zermatt); it is bounded by huge glaciers which come right down into the valley; the village of Praborgne is fairly high, and stands at a great height above the glaciers; its climate is almost as warm as that of Italy, and plants belonging to hot countries are to be found there at considerable altitudes, above the ice.\"<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n\n[[William Brockedon]], who came to the region in 1825, considered the crossing of the Theodul Pass from Breuil to Zermatt a difficult undertaking. He gave, however, expression to his enthusiasm on the summit. When he arrived exhausted on the top of the pass, he gazed \"on the beautiful pyramid of the Cervin, more wonderful than aught else in sight, rising from its bed of ice to a height of 5,000 feet, a spectacle of indescribable grandeur.\" In this \"immense natural amphitheatre, enclosed from time immemorial by snow-clad mountains and glaciers ever white, in the presence of these grand walls the mind is overwhelmed, not indeed that it is unable to contemplate the scene, but it staggers under the immensity of those objects which it contemplates.\"\n\nThose who made their way up through the Valtournanche to the foot of the mountain were few in number. [[W. A. B. Coolidge]], a diligent collector of old and new stories of the Alps, mentions that during those years, besides Brockedon, only Hirzel-Escher of Z\u00fcrich, who crossed the Theodul Pass in 1822, starting from Breuil, accompanied by a local guide. The greater number came from the [[Valais]] up the [[Visp]] valley to [[Zermatt]]. In 1813, a Frenchman, Henri Maynard, climbed to the Theodul Pass and made the first ascent of the [[Breithorn]]; he was accompanied by numerous guides, among them J. M. Couttet of Chamonix, the same man who had gone with de Saussure to the top of the [[Klein Matterhorn]] in 1792.\nThe writings of these pioneers make much mention of the Matterhorn; the bare and inert rock is gradually quickened into life by men's enthusiasm. \"Stronger minds,\" remarked [[Edward Whymper]], \"felt the influence of the wonderful form, and men who ordinarily spoke or wrote like rational beings, when they came under its power seemed to quit their senses, and ranted and rhapsodised, losing for a time all common forms of speech.\"<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n\nAmong the poets of the Matterhorn during these years (1834 to 1840) were [[Elie de Beaumont]], a famous French geologist; [[Pierre Jean \u00c9douard Desor]], a naturalist of Neuch\u00e2tel, who went up there with a party of friends, two of whom were [[Louis Agassiz]] and [[Bernhard Studer]]. Christian Moritz Engelhardt, who was so filled with admiration for Zermatt and its neighbourhood that he returned there at least ten times (from 1835 to 1855), described these places in two valuable volumes, drew panoramas and maps, and collected the most minute notes on the mineralogy and botany of the region. Zermatt was at that time a quiet little village, and travellers found hospitality at the parish priest's, or at the village doctor's.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n[[File:Matterhorn Ruskin.jpeg|thumb|''The Matterhorn'' by [[John Ruskin]], 1849]]\n\nIn 1841 [[James David Forbes]], professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, came to see the Matterhorn. A philosopher and geologist, and an observant traveller, he continued the work of De Saussure in his journeys and his writings. He was full of admiration for the Matterhorn, calling it the most wonderful peak in the Alps, unsealed and unscalable. These words, pronounced by a man noted among all his contemporaries for his thorough knowledge of mountains, show what men's feelings then were towards the Matterhorn, and how at a time when the idea of [[Exploration of the High Alps|Alpine exploration]] was gaining ground in their minds, the Matterhorn stood by itself as a mountain apart, of whose conquest it was vain even to dream. And such it remained till long after this; as such it was described by [[John Ball (naturalist)|John Ball]] twenty years later in his celebrated guide-book. Forbes ascended the Theodul Pass in 1842, climbed the Breithorn, and came down to Breuil; as he descended from the savage scenery of the Matterhorn, the Italian landscapes of the Valtournanche seemed to him like paradise. Meanwhile [[Gottlieb Samuel Studer]], the geographer, together with Melchior Ulrich, was describing and mapping the topographical features of the Zermatt peaks.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/><ref>Sydney Spencer,''Mountaineering'', p. 27, 1934</ref>\n\n[[Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer]], who first accompanied and guided youth to the Alps for purposes of education and amusement, began his journeys in 1832, but it is only in 1840 that he mentions the Matterhorn. Two years later T\u00f6pffer and his pupils came to Zermatt. He has described this journey of his in a chapter entitled ''Voyage autour du Mont Blanc jusqu'\u00e0 Zermatt'', here he sings a hymn of praise to the Matterhorn, comparing its form with a \"huge crystal of a hundred facets, flashing varied hues, that softly reflects the light, unshaded, from the uttermost depths of the heavens\". T\u00f6pffer's book was illustrated by [[Alexandre Calame]], his master and friend, with drawings of the Matterhorn, executed in the romantic style of the period. It is an artificial mountain, a picture corresponding rather with the exaggerated effect it produces on the astonished mind of the artist, than with the real form of the mountain.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n\nAbout this time there came a man who studied the Matterhorn in its structure and form, and who sketched it and described it in all its parts with the curiosity of the artist and the insight of the scientist. This was [[John Ruskin]], a new and original type of philosopher and geologist, painter and poet, whom England was enabled to create during that period of radical intellectual reforms, which led the way for the highest development of her civilisation. Ruskin was the Matterhorn's poet par excellence. He went to Zermatt in 1844, and it is to be noticed as a curious fact, that the first time he saw the Matterhorn it did not please him. The mountain on its lofty pedestal in the very heart of the Alps was, perhaps, too far removed from the ideal he had formed of the mountains; but he returned, studied and dreamt for long at its feet, and at length he pronounced it \"the most noble cliff in Europe.\" Ruskin was no mountaineer, nor a great friend to mountaineering; he drew sketches of the mountains merely as an illustration of his teaching of the beauty of natural forms, which was the object of his whole life. In his work on Modern Painters he makes continual use of the mountains as an example of beauty and an incentive to morality. The publication of Ruskin's work certainly produced a great impression at the time on educated people in England, and a widespread desire to see the mountains.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n\n{{quote|It is a fragment of some size; a group of broken walls, one of them overhanging; crowned with a cornice, nodding some hundred and fifty feet over its massive flank, three thousand above its glacier base, and fourteen thousand above the sea, \u2014 a wall truly of some majesty, at once the most precipitous and the strongest mass in the whole chain of the Alps, the Mont Cervin.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>}}\n\n[[File:Spelterini Matterhorn 1910.jpg|thumb|Aerial photography by [[Eduard Spelterini]] in 1910]]\nOther men of high attainments followed, but in the years 1850 scientists and artists were about to be succeeded by real climbers and the passes and peaks around Zermatt were explored little by little. In the preface to the first volume of the ''[[Alpine Journal]]'', which appeared in 1863, the editor [[Hereford Brooke George]] wrote that: \"While even if all other objects of interest in Switzerland should be exhausted, the Matterhorn remains (who shall say for how long?) unconquered and apparently invincible.\"Whymper successfully reached the summit in 1865, but four men perished on the descent. The English papers discussed it with bitter words of blame; a German newspaper published an article in which Whymper was accused of cutting the rope between Douglas and Taugwalder, at the critical moment, to save his own life.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/>\n\nIn 1890 the Federal Government was asked simultaneously by the same contractor for a concession for the [[Gornergrat railway|Zermatt-Gornergrat railway]], and for a Zermatt-Matterhorn one. The Gornergrat railway was constructed, and has been working since 1899, but there has been no more talk of the other. The project essentially consisted of a line which went up to the H\u00f6rnli, and continued thence in a rectilinear tunnel about two kilometres long, built under the ridge, and issuing near the summit on the Zmutt side.<ref name = TheMatterhorn/> Sixty years later in 1950, Italian engineer Count Dino Lora Totino planned a cable car on the Italian side from Breuil-Cervinia to the summit. But the Alpine Museum of Zermatt sent a protest letter with 90,000 signatures to the Italian government. The latter declared the Matterhorn a natural wonder worthy of protection and refused the concession to the engineer.<ref>[http://www.merian.de/reiseziele/artikel/a-698707-2.html Trag\u00f6dien am Matterhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723010555/http://www.merian.de/reiseziele/artikel/a-698707-2.html |date=2011-07-23 }}, Johannes Schweikle, Merian.de</ref>\n\nDuring the 20th century, the Matterhorn and the story of the first ascent in particular, inspired various artists and film producers such as [[Luis Trenker]] and [[Walt Disney]].<ref>Hans-Michael Bock, Tim Bergfelder, ''The Concise Cinegraph: Encyclopaedia of German Cinema'', p. 480</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://michaelbarrier.com/Essays/EuropeanJournal_Zermatt/europeanjournal_zermatt.htm|title=MichaelBarrier.com -- Essays: Zermatt|website=michaelbarrier.com}}</ref> Large-scale replicas can be found at [[Matterhorn Bobsleds|Disneyland]] and [[Window of the World]].\n\nDesigned in 1908 by Emil Cardinaux, a leading poster artist of the time, the [[:File:Emil Cardinaux-Zermatt.jpg|Matterhorn affiche]] for the Zermatt tourist office is often considered the first modern poster.
