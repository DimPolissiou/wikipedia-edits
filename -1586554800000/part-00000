The [[1941 October Revolution Parade|parade in 1941]] is particularly revered as it took place during the [[Battle of Moscow]], during which many of the soldiers on the parade would be killed in action. In 1953, the parade took place as the first one to not be inspected by officers on horseback.<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/parades-nov7.htm</ref> The practice of foreign leaders began in 1957 with [[Mao Zedong]] attending that year's parade as part of a [[state visit]], continuing throughout the next two decades with Ethiopian leader [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]]'s attendance in 1980 and the leaders of [[Warsaw Pact]] and USSR-allied nations in 1967, 1977 and 1987. The [[1989 October Revolution Parade|1989 parade]] was the first to have a drill routine by the massed bands take place. During the [[1990 October Revolution Parade|final parade]] in 1990, an assassination attempt was made on the life of President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], attempt to kill President by Alexander Shmonov, a locksmith from [[Leningrad]].

The celebrations begin at 9:50 am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival honors for the commander of the parade, who is greeted by the commandant of the Frunze Military Academy (now the [[Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation]]), and receives the report on the parade's status. Once the parade commander (who is usually a Colonel General with the billet of Commander of the Moscow Military District) receives the report, he takes his position in the parade and orders the formations to stand at ease. A couple minutes later, a Communist Party and government delegation arrives at the grandstand on top of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]]. The dignitaries include the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]], [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]], the [[Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], members of the entire [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], including members from the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] and Secretariat, the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service branch commanders, deputy defence ministers, members of the cabinet and commanders of the support departments in the general staff, in addition to the occasional foreign head of state or party as the principal foreign guest and reviewing officer. In between the south of the grandstand is a platoon of the armed linemen and markers from the [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment|Independent Commandant's Regiment]] in military overcoats whose purpose is to take post to mark the distance of the troops marching past. Seated in the stands on the west and east sides were residents of the capital, visitors from all over the Union, the diplomatic corps and military attaches and guests from allied and friendly countries with ties to the Union government. Within Red Square the more than 9,000 strong parade formation (11,000 during jubilee years) was complemented by the Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison, conducted by the Senior Director of Music of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces, the billet of an officer who usually held major general rank, at the start of the parade the bands were split into four sections across the expanse of the Square in between the inspecting formations. The mobile column, also present, was made up of around 170-380 vehicles and around 3,900 crews drawn from the participant units making up the segment of the parade.\n\n==== Parade proper ====\n[[File:Naval Academy 1983.jpg|thumb|The Leningrad parade in 1983.]]\nAs the [[Kremlin]]'s [[Spasskaya Tower]] sounds the chimes at 10am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms and look to the left for inspection. The Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) then is driven on a limousine to the center of the square to receive the parade report from the commander, with the combined bands playing ''Jubillee March of the Red Army'' in the background. Once the report is received, the Minister and the parade commander begin to inspect the parading formations together with the bands. The limousinesed stop at each formation in order for the minister to send his greeting to the contingents, in which they respond with a threefold \"Ura\" ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0423\u0440\u0430). Other than the Red Square inspection, the commander and the minister would also inspect the personnel of the mobile column on Manezhnaya Square. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands played ''[[Long Live our State]]'' by [[Boris Alexandrovich Alexandrov]] as the commander returns to his place in the parade, and the Minister driven to the grandstand while the entire parade shouts 'Ura!' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0423\u0440\u0430!) repeatedly until he takes his position in the grandstand and the bands end playing (from 1945 to 1966 ''[[Slavsya]]'' from ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' took its place and yet again in 1990). During this time, the [[corps of drums|Corps of Drums]] of the [[Moscow Military Music College]], which is an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's limousine. The parade is then ordered to stand at ease and the chromatic fanfare trumpeters, together with the rest of the musicians of the massed bands, sound a fanfare call, usually Govovin's ''Moscow Fanfare'' for the keynote address by the minister which will follow. As the minister concludes his address, he will yell \"Ura!\" ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \"\u0423\u0440\u0430!\") to which the entire parade repeats thrice. The Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison then play the full version of the [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union]] while a ceremonial battery armed with the [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)]] fire a [[21-gun salute]]. As the anthem ends, the bands sound a second fanfare and the parade commander orders the parade to do carry out the following commands for the march past:\n\n::''Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past!''<br>''Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn!''<br>''Slope.. arms!''<br>''Eyes to the right...''<br>''Quick march!''\n\nOn the command \"Quick march!\", the linemen take their places at the south end of the square while the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College march to a drum tune, while the fifers and trumpeters play a specific tune, in a tradition that would go on until the late 1990s and early 2000s when the trumpets were removed. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums begin to swing their drumsticks while on the eyes right led by the drum major. The Corps is immediately followed by the officers of the Frunze Military Academy whereas on jubilee parades, the massed colour guard is the first formation other than the corps on the square, followed by a historical contingent. The troops have always marched in the following order during the parade:\n\n===== Order of ground march past column =====\n\n'''Military Bands'''\n* Massed Bands of the Moscow Military District under the direction of the Senior Director of Music of the Bands Service\n* Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College\n\n'''Ground Column'''\n* Parade commander holding the appointment of commanding officer of the [[Moscow Military District]]\n* Color Guard Unit (in jubilee parades)\n* Historical contingent (in jubilee parades)\n** Red Guards\n** Ex-Imperial Russian Army servicemen within the Red Army\n** Sailors of the Aurora\n** Red Army soldiers during the Civil War\n** Great Patriotic War contingent\n* [[Frunze Military Academy]]\n* V.I.

When the ground segment ends, the bands perform an about turn and march towards the facade of the GUM department store to give way to the mobile column, which drives past as the bands play ''Victorious March'' and ''Moscow Salute''. Once the ground mobile column is complete, the bands take their position at the western end of the square to prepare for the finale, led by the senior director of music, conductors, bandmasters and drum majors. The finale involves the massed bands marching down the square to the tune of ''[[Song of the Soviet Army]]'' or ''Metropolitan March'' and as the bands march past the grandstand, the senior director of music, conductors and bandmasters salute at the eyes right. In 1967, the massed bands marched out to the tune of ''My Beloved Motherland''.\n\n===== Order of mobile column drivepast =====\n* 2nd Guards Motor Rifle Division\n* 98th Guards Airborne Division\n* 4th Guards Tank Division\n* Moscow Military District Field Artillery and Rocket Forces\n* Moscow Military District Ground Forces Air Defense\n* 1st Moscow Air and Air Defense Forces Army\n* [[Northern Fleet]] and [[Baltic Fleet]] Coastal Defense, Surface and Submarine Forces (until 1974)\n* Strategic Missile Forces [[27th Guards Rocket Army]]\n\nSimilar parade events were held in all major cities in the [[RSFSR]] as well as in the [[USSR]], with the first secretary of the local communist party branch being the guest of honor and the commander of the regional military district or large formation acting as the parade inspector and keynote speaker, while the second-in command of the unit or command served as parade commander. The parade format is the same in these cities, with particularities beiing shaped to fit the specific parade ground (e.g. [[October Square, Minsk]]). Massed bands for the parade were drawn from the formation or district bands located in their respective areas. The Government of the [[Armenian SSR]] cancelled the 1989 parade in [[Yerevan]] due to extended protests, while the mobile column of the parade in the Moldovan capital of [[Kishinev]] was removed from the itinerary due to protester blcoking the streets and preventing passage to vehicles.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/11/07/Soviet-Revolution-Day-celebrations-disrupted/1102626418000/|title=Soviet Revolution Day celebrations disrupted|access-date=2017-02-11|language=en|newspaper=UPI}}</ref> A similar occurred event occurred on what is now [[Gediminas Avenue]] in Vilnius.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=LordBenas|title=1989 sovietinis paradas Gedimino prospektu.|date=2008-05-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arDpzcWhxlg|accessdate=2017-03-20}}</ref>\n\n==== Civil parade and workers' demonstration ====\n[[File:Moscow 1977-11-07-15.jpg|thumb|Workers demonstration]]\nThe bands having marched off the square is the signal for the commencement of the holiday civil parade and workers' demonstration in Red Square. In jubilee years (more frequency in the parades of the 1960s and 1970s), the civil parade kicks off with a spectacular march made up of the following components preceding the workers' demonstration march:\n\n* Red flag bearers\n* Historical segment (present in the parades of 1967 and 1987)\n* Officials, management, staff and employees of the Moscow City CPSU Committee and Moscow City Council\n* Representatives of state economic enterprises and firms in Moscow\n* [[Komsomol]]\n* [[Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization]]\n* [[DOSAAF]]\n* Color Guard, Athletes and Coaches from the [[Voluntary Sports Societies of the Soviet Union]]\n* Moscow National Central Physical Fitness and Sports School\n\n[[File:70th Anniversary Emblem.png|thumb|The logo of the 1987 celebrations.]]\n\nFloat displays also featured prominently in the civil parades where floats were designed to promote government and party campaigns or highlight the works of various public companies, farm collectives and state economic firms. At a certain point during the civil parade, Pioneers in winter jackets and carrying flowers representing schools in Moscow and all over the country run towards the front of the Mausoleum facade and are split into two groups that ascend the staircases towards the dignitaries in the grandstand to give them flower bouquets. Following the civil parade the workers' demonstration officially begins, wherein workers from state economic and social firms in Moscow, as well as from schools and universities, march past as part of their respective community delegations. Each delegation has a color guard unit and brass band taking part, as well as floats from the participating state enterprises. Each of Moscow's districts march past the grandstand to greet everyone a Happy Revolution Day, especially to the dignitaries and everyone in the stands watching as balloons fly out from the crowds filing past while recorded music is played on the speakers. After an hour or two, the civil parade ends with a huge crowd bidding the principal dignitaries farewell from the grounds of the square with red flags in their hands as one final cheer resounds from the sound systems installed along the entire length of the square.\n\nSimilar civil parades occurred in all major cities and the republican capital cities following the military parades.\n\n==Post-Soviet observance==\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433 7 \u043d\u043e\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 13 \u0420\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d.jpg|thumb|CPRF celebrations in 2009.]]\nIn Russia, the holiday was repurposed several times.

The [[1941 October Revolution Parade|parade in 1941]] is particularly revered as it took place during the [[Battle of Moscow]], during which many of the soldiers on the parade would be killed in action. In 1953, the parade took place as the first one to not be inspected by officers on horseback.<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/parades-nov7.htm</ref> The practice of foreign leaders began in 1957 with [[Mao Zedong]] attending that year's parade as part of a [[state visit]], continuing throughout the next two decades with Ethiopian leader [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]]'s attendance in 1980 and the leaders of [[Warsaw Pact]] and USSR-allied nations in 1967, 1977 and 1987. The [[1989 October Revolution Parade|1989 parade]] was the first to have a drill routine by the massed bands take place.

The celebrations begin at 9:50 am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival honors for the commander of the parade, who is greeted by the commandant of the Frunze Military Academy (now the [[Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation]]), and receives the report on the parade's status. Once the parade commander (who is usually a Colonel General with the billet of Commander of the Moscow Military District) receives the report, he takes his position in the parade and orders the formations to stand at ease. A couple minutes later, a Communist Party and government delegation arrives at the grandstand on top of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]]. The dignitaries include the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]], [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]], the [[Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], members of the entire [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], including members from the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] and Secretariat, the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service branch commanders, deputy defence ministers, members of the cabinet and commanders of the support departments in the general staff, in addition to the occasional foreign head of state or party as the principal foreign guest and reviewing officer. In between the south of the grandstand is a platoon of the armed linemen and markers from the [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment|Independent Commandant's Regiment]] in military overcoats whose purpose is to take post to mark the distance of the troops marching past. Seated in the stands on the west and east sides were residents of the capital, visitors from all over the Union, the diplomatic corps and military attaches and guests from allied and friendly countries with ties to the Union government. Within Red Square the more than 9,000 strong parade formation (11,000 during jubilee years) was complemented by the Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison, conducted by the Senior Director of Music of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces, the billet of an officer who usually held major general rank, at the start of the parade the bands were split into four sections across the expanse of the Square in between the inspecting formations. The mobile column, also present, was made up of around 170-380 vehicles and around 3,900 crews drawn from the participant units making up the segment of the parade.\n\n==== Parade proper ====\n[[File:Naval Academy 1983.jpg|thumb|The Leningrad parade in 1983.]]\nAs the [[Kremlin]]'s [[Spasskaya Tower]] sounds the chimes at 10am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms and look to the left for inspection. The Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) then is driven on a limousine to the center of the square to receive the parade report from the commander, with the combined bands playing ''Jubillee March of the Red Army'' in the background. Once the report is received, the Minister and the parade commander begin to inspect the parading formations together with the bands. The limousinesed stop at each formation in order for the minister to send his greeting to the contingents, in which they respond with a threefold \"Ura\" ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0423\u0440\u0430). Other than the Red Square inspection, the commander and the minister would also inspect the personnel of the mobile column on Manezhnaya Square. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands played ''[[Long Live our State]]'' by [[Boris Alexandrovich Alexandrov]] as the commander returns to his place in the parade, and the Minister driven to the grandstand while the entire parade shouts 'Ura!' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0423\u0440\u0430!) repeatedly until he takes his position in the grandstand and the bands end playing (from 1945 to 1966 ''[[Slavsya]]'' from ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' took its place and yet again in 1990). During this time, the [[corps of drums|Corps of Drums]] of the [[Moscow Military Music College]], which is an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's limousine. The parade is then ordered to stand at ease and the chromatic fanfare trumpeters, together with the rest of the musicians of the massed bands, sound a fanfare call, usually Govovin's ''Moscow Fanfare'' for the keynote address by the minister which will follow. As the minister concludes his address, he will yell \"Ura!\" ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \"\u0423\u0440\u0430!\") to which the entire parade repeats thrice. The Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison then play the full version of the [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union]] while a ceremonial battery armed with the [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)]] fire a [[21-gun salute]]. As the anthem ends, the bands sound a second fanfare and the parade commander orders the parade to do carry out the following commands for the march past:\n\n::''Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past!''<br>''Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn!''<br>''Slope.. arms!''<br>''Eyes to the right...''<br>''Quick march!''\n\nOn the command \"Quick march!\", the linemen take their places at the south end of the square while the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College march to a drum tune, while the fifers and trumpeters play a specific tune, in a tradition that would go on until the late 1990s and early 2000s when the trumpets were removed. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums begin to swing their drumsticks while on the eyes right led by the drum major. The Corps is immediately followed by the officers of the Frunze Military Academy whereas on jubilee parades, the massed colour guard is the first formation other than the corps on the square, followed by a historical contingent. The troops have always marched in the following order during the parade:\n\n===== Order of ground march past column =====\n\n'''Military Bands'''\n* Massed Bands of the Moscow Military District under the direction of the Senior Director of Music of the Bands Service\n* Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College\n\n'''Ground Column'''\n* Parade commander holding the appointment of commanding officer of the [[Moscow Military District]]\n* Color Guard Unit (in jubilee parades)\n* Historical contingent (in jubilee parades)\n** Red Guards\n** Ex-Imperial Russian Army servicemen within the Red Army\n** Sailors of the Aurora\n** Red Army soldiers during the Civil War\n** Great Patriotic War contingent\n* [[Frunze Military Academy]]\n* V.I.

When the ground segment ends, the bands perform an about turn and march towards the facade of the GUM department store to give way to the mobile column, which drives past as the bands play ''Victorious March'' and ''Moscow Salute''. Once the ground mobile column is complete, the bands take their position at the western end of the square to prepare for the finale, led by the senior director of music, conductors, bandmasters and drum majors. The finale involves the massed bands marching down the square to the tune of ''[[Song of the Soviet Army]]'' or ''Metropolitan March'' and as the bands march past the grandstand, the senior director of music, conductors and bandmasters salute at the eyes right. In 1967, the massed bands marched out to the tune of ''My Beloved Motherland''.\n\n===== Order of mobile column drivepast =====\n* 2nd Guards Motor Rifle Division\n* 98th Guards Airborne Division\n* 4th Guards Tank Division\n* Moscow Military District Field Artillery and Rocket Forces\n* Moscow Military District Ground Forces Air Defense\n* 1st Moscow Air and Air Defense Forces Army\n* [[Northern Fleet]] and [[Baltic Fleet]] Coastal Defense, Surface and Submarine Forces (until 1974)\n* Strategic Missile Forces [[27th Guards Rocket Army]]\n\nSimilar parade events were held in all major cities in the [[RSFSR]] as well as in the [[USSR]], with the first secretary of the local communist party branch being the guest of honor and the commander of the regional military district or large formation acting as the parade inspector and keynote speaker, while the second-in command of the unit or command served as parade commander. The parade format is the same in these cities, with particularities beiing shaped to fit the specific parade ground (e.g. [[October Square, Minsk]]). Massed bands for the parade were drawn from the formation or district bands located in their respective areas.

At a certain point during the civil parade, Pioneers in winter jackets and carrying flowers representing schools in Moscow and all over the country run towards the front of the Mausoleum facade and are split into two groups that ascend the staircases towards the dignitaries in the grandstand to give them flower bouquets. Following the civil parade the workers' demonstration officially begins, wherein workers from state economic and social firms in Moscow, as well as from schools and universities, march past as part of their respective community delegations. Each delegation has a color guard unit and brass band taking part, as well as floats from the participating state enterprises. Each of Moscow's districts march past the grandstand to greet everyone a Happy Revolution Day, especially to the dignitaries and everyone in the stands watching as balloons fly out from the crowds filing past while recorded music is played on the speakers. After an hour or two, the civil parade ends with a huge crowd bidding the principal dignitaries farewell from the grounds of the square with red flags in their hands as one final cheer resounds from the sound systems installed along the entire length of the square.\n\nSimilar civil parades occurred in all major cities and the republican capital cities following the military parades.\n\n==Post-Soviet observance==\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433 7 \u043d\u043e\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 13 \u0420\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d.jpg|thumb|CPRF celebrations in 2009.]]\nIn Russia, the holiday was repurposed several times.

It was released on March 5, 1976, just eight months after her international breakthrough with the single and album of the same name \u2013 \"[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]\". The bold, sexual nature of that particular song had earned Summer the title 'the first lady of love'. By now Summer's work was being distributed in the U.S. by [[Casablanca Records]], and the label encouraged Summer, Moroder and team to continue in this vein. ''A Love Trilogy'' uses the first side for one long disco track in three distinct movements 'Try Me', 'I Know', 'We Can Make It', and coalescing into the \"love trilogy\" of the title \u2013 \"[[Try Me, I Know We Can Make It]]\". Side two contained three additional erotic  disco songs, including a cover of [[Barry Manilow]]'s \"[[Could It Be Magic]]\". The album's artwork showed Summer floating light-heartedly through the clouds, again adding to the image of her as a fantasy figure.\n\nThe album sold well across the world, (it was her second, consecutive album to be certified Gold in the [[United States]]) and again topped the national US Disco charts. Edited versions of \"Try Me, I Know We Can Make It\" and \"Could It Be Magic\" did not reach the top forty on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, but the latter was a sizable R&B hit (#21) and disco hit (#3). Casablanca released a 12-inch version of \"Try Me I Know We Can Make It\" with \"Love to Love You Baby\" on the reverse side. The single \"Could It Be Magic\" was a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands.\n\nThe album did not fare so well in the UK where it reached only the no. 41 spot in September, some six months after its initial release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/a%20love%20trilogy/ |publisher= officialcharts.com|accessdate= 2016-09-14|title=Official Charts: A Love Trilogy}}</ref> Likewise

The single \"Could It Be Magic\" was a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands.\n\nThe album did not fare so well in the UK where it reached only the no. 41 spot in September, some six months after its initial release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/a%20love%20trilogy/ |publisher= officialcharts.com|accessdate= 2016-09-14|title=Official Charts: A Love Trilogy}}</ref> Likewise the single \"Could It Be Magic\" which only reached no. 40.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/could%20it%20be%20magic/ |publisher= officialcharts.com|accessdate= 2016-09-14|title=Official Charts: Could It Be Magic}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\nAll tracks produced by [[Pete Bellotte]] and [[Giorgio Moroder]].\n{{tracklist\n| headline        = Side one\n| title1          = [[Try Me, I Know We Can Make It]]\n| writer1         = {{hlist|[[Donna Summer]]|Bellotte|Moroder}}\n| length1         = 17:57\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| headline        = Side two\n| title2          = Prelude to Love\n| writer2         = {{hlist|Summer|Bellotte|Moroder}}\n| length2         = 1:06\n| title3          = [[Could It Be Magic]]\n| writer3         = {{hlist|Adrienne Anderson|[[Barry Manilow]]}}\n| length3         = 5:19\n| title4          = Wasted\n| writer4         = {{hlist|Bellotte|Moroder}}\n| length4         = 5:09\n| title5          = Come With Me\n| writer5         = {{hlist|Bellotte|Moroder}}\n| length5         = 4:22\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n*Donna Summer&nbsp;\u2013 vocals\n*[[Giorgio Moroder]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[bass guitar]], producer and synthesizer\n*[[Pete Bellotte]]&nbsp;\u2013 producer\n*Backing vocals: [[Madeline Bell]], [[Sue and sunny|Sunny Leslie, Sue Glover]] (the Midnite Ladies)\n*Other musicians on this album were known collectively as \"Munich Machine\" and worked on a variety of Moroder/Bellotte productions from this period.\n*Munich Machine are: Thor Baldursson&nbsp;\u2013 keyboards, string arrangement, Frank Diez&nbsp;\u2013 guitar, [[Keith Forsey]]&nbsp;\u2013 drums, Martin Harrison&nbsp;\u2013 drums, Molly Moll&nbsp;\u2013 guitar, Gary Unwin&nbsp;\u2013 bass guitar, Les Hurdle&nbsp;

{"title_page": "Vizing's theorem", "text_new": "In [[graph theory]], '''Vizing's theorem''' states that every simple [[undirected graph]] may be [[edge coloring|edge colored]] using a number of colors that is at most one larger than the maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] {{math|\u0394}} of the graph.\nAt least {{math|\u0394}} colors are always necessary, so the undirected graphs may be partitioned into two classes: \"class one\" graphs for which {{math|\u0394}} colors suffice, and \"class two\" graphs for which {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors are necessary.\nA more generalized version of Vizing's theorem states that every undirected [[multigraph]] can be colored with at most {{math|\u0394+\u00b5}} colors, where {{math|\u00b5}} is the multiplicity of the multigraph.\nThe theorem is named for [[Vadim G. Vizing]] who published it in 1964.\n\n==Examples==\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 1}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must itself be a matching, with no two edges adjacent, and its edge chromatic number is one. That is, all graphs with {{math|1=\u0394(''G'') = 1}} are of class one.\n\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must be a [[disjoint union]] of [[path (graph theory)|paths]] and [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]. If all cycles are even, they can be 2-edge-colored by alternating the two colors around each cycle. However, if there exists at least one odd cycle, then no 2-edge-coloring is possible. That is, a graph with {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}} is of class one if and only if it is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]].\n\n==Proof==\nThis proof is inspired by {{harvtxt|Diestel|2000}}.\n\nLet {{math|1=''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''V'',&nbsp;''E'')}} be a simple undirected graph. We proceed by induction on {{math|''m''}}, the number of edges. If the graph is empty, the theorem trivially holds. Let {{math|''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0}} and suppose a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists for all {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} where {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}}.\n\nWe say that color {{math|&alpha;&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;{1,...,\u0394+1}}} is missing in {{math|''x''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''V''}} with respect to proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring {{math|''c''}} if {{math|''c''(''xy'')&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;&alpha;}} for all {{math|''y''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;N(''x'')}}. Also, let {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''x''}} denote the unique maximal path starting in {{math|''x''}} with {{math|&alpha;}}-colored edge and alternating the colors of edges (the second edge has color {{math|&beta;}}, the third edge has color {{math|&alpha;}} and so on), its length can be {{math|0}}. Note that if {{math|''c''}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} then every vertex has a missing color with respect to {{math|''c''}}.\n\nSuppose that no proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} exists. This is equivalent to this statement:\n:(1) Let {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''}} be arbitrary proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|&beta;}} be missing from {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''c''}}. Then the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''}} ends in {{math|''x''}}.\n\nThis is equivalent, because if (1) doesn't hold, then we can interchange the colors {{math|&alpha;}} and {{math|&beta;}} on the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path and set the color of {{math|''xy''}} to be {{math|&alpha;}}, thus creating a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} from {{math|''c''}}. The other way around, if a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists, then we can delete an edge, restrict the coloring and (1) won't hold either.\n\nNow, let {{math|''xy''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} be a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing in {{math|''x''}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}. We define {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} to be a maximal sequence of neighbours of {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nWe define coloring {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} as\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''</sub>){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''+1</sub>)}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''}},\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} not defined,\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''e''){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''e'')}} otherwise.\n\nThen {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>}} due to definition of {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Also, note that the missing colors in {{math|''x''}} are the same with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nLet {{math|&beta;}} be the color missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}, then {{math|&beta;}} is also missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}. Note that {{math|&beta;}} cannot be missing in {{math|''x''}}, otherwise we could easily extend {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, therefore an edge with color {{math|&beta;}} is incident to {{math|''x''}} for all {{math|''c''<sub>''j''</sub>}}. From the maximality of {{math|''k''}}, there exists {{math|1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}. From the definition of {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} this holds: \n:{{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''k''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}\n\nLet {{math|''P''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. From (1), {{math|''P''}} has to end in {{math|''x''}}. But {{math|&alpha;}} is missing in {{math|''x''}}, so it has to end with an edge of color {{math|&beta;}}. Therefore, the last edge of {{math|''P''}} is {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>''x''}}. Now, let {{math|''P' ''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}}. Since {{math|''P' ''}} is uniquely determined and the inner edges of {{math|''P''}} are not changed in {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, the path {{math|''P' ''}} uses the same edges as {{math|''P''}} in reverse order and visits {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. The edge leading to {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} clearly has color {{math|&alpha;}}. But {{math|&beta;}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, so {{math|''P' ''}} ends in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Which is a contradiction with (1) above.\n\n==Classification of graphs==\nSeveral authors have provided additional conditions that classify some graphs as being of class one or class two, but do not provide a complete classification. For instance, if the vertices of the maximum degree {{math|\u0394}} in a graph {{mvar|G}} form an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], or more generally if the [[induced subgraph]] for this set of vertices is a forest, then {{mvar|G}} must be of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fournier|1973}}.</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Erd\u0151s|Wilson|1977}} showed that [[almost all]] graphs are of class one. That is, in the [[Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model]] of random graphs, in which all {{mvar|n}}-vertex graphs are equally likely, let {{math|''p''(''n'')}} be the probability that an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph drawn from this distribution is of class one; then {{math|''p''(''n'')}} approaches one in the limit as {{mvar|n}} goes to infinity. For more precise bounds on the rate at which {{math|''p''(''n'')}} converges to one, see {{harvtxt|Frieze|Jackson|McDiarmid|Reed|1988}}.\n\n==Planar graphs==\n{{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} showed that a [[planar graph]] is of class one if its maximum degree is at least eight.\nIn contrast, he observed that for any maximum degree in the range from two to five, there exist\nplanar graphs of class two.  For degree two, any odd cycle is such a graph, and for degree three, four, and five, these graphs can be constructed from [[platonic solid]]s by replacing a single edge by a path of two adjacent edges.\n\nIn '''Vizing's planar graph conjecture''', {{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} states that all simple, planar graphs with maximum degree six or seven are of class one, closing the remaining possible cases.\n{{harvtxt|Sanders|Zhao|2001}} partially proved Vizing's planar graph conjecture by showing that all planar graphs with maximum degree seven are of class one.\nThus, the only case of the conjecture that remains unsolved is that of maximum degree six. This conjecture has implications for the [[Total coloring|total coloring conjecture]].\n\nThe planar graphs of class two constructed by subdivision of the platonic solids are not regular: they have vertices of degree two as well as vertices of higher degree.\nThe [[four color theorem]] (proved by {{harvtxt|Appel|Haken|1976}}) on vertex coloring of planar graphs, is equivalent to the statement that every bridgeless 3-regular planar graph is of class one {{harv|Tait|1880}}.\n\n==Graphs on nonplanar surfaces==\nIn 1969, [[Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum]] conjectured that every 3-regular graph with a polyhedral embedding on any two-dimensional [[oriented manifold]] such as a [[torus]] must be of class one. In this context, a polyhedral embedding is a [[graph embedding]] such that every face of the embedding is topologically a disk and such that the [[dual graph]] of the embedding is simple, with no self-loops or multiple adjacencies. If true, this would be a generalization of the four color theorem, which was shown by Tait to be equivalent to the statement that  3-regular graphs with a polyhedral embedding on a [[sphere]] are of class one. However, {{harvtxt|Kochol|2009}} showed the conjecture to be false by finding [[Snark (graph theory)|snarks]] that have polyhedral embeddings on high-genus orientable surfaces. Based on this construction, he also showed that it is NP-complete to tell whether a polyhedrally embedded graph is of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kochol|2010}}.</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\n{{harvtxt|Misra|Gries|1992}} describe a polynomial time algorithm for coloring the edges of any graph with {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors, where {{math|\u0394}} is the maximum degree of the graph. That is, the algorithm uses the optimal number of colors for graphs of class two, and uses at most one more color than necessary for all graphs. Their algorithm follows the same strategy as Vizing's original proof of his theorem: it starts with an uncolored graph, and then repeatedly finds a way of recoloring the graph in order to increase the number of colored edges by one.\n\nMore specifically, suppose that {{math|''uv''}} is an uncolored edge in a partially colored graph. The algorithm of Misra and Gries may be interpreted as constructing a directed [[pseudoforest]] {{mvar|P}} (a graph in which each vertex has at most one outgoing edge) on the neighbors of {{mvar|u}}: for each neighbor {{mvar|p}} of {{mvar|u}}, the algorithm finds a color {{mvar|c}} that is not used by any of the edges incident to {{mvar|p}}, finds the vertex {{mvar|q}} (if it exists) for which edge {{mvar|uq}} has color {{mvar|c}}, and adds {{mvar|pq}} as an edge to {{mvar|P}}. There are two cases:\n*If the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} constructed in this way contains a path from {{mvar|v}} to a vertex {{mvar|w}} that has no outgoing edges in {{mvar|P}}, then there is a color {{mvar|c}} that is available both at {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|w}}. Recoloring edge {{mvar|uw}} with color {{mvar|c}} allows the remaining edge colors to be shifted one step along this path: for each vertex {{mvar|p}} in the path, edge {{mvar|up}} takes the color that was previously used by the successor of {{mvar|p}} in the path. This leads to a new coloring that includes edge {{mvar|uv}}.\n*If, on the other hand, the path starting from {{mvar|v}} in the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} leads to a cycle, let {{mvar|w}} be the neighbor of {{mvar|u}} at which the path joins the cycle, let {{mvar|c}} be the color of edge {{mvar|uw}}, and let {{mvar|d}} be a color that is not used by any of the edges at vertex {{mvar|u}}. Then swapping colors {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|d}} on a [[Kempe chain]] either breaks the cycle or the edge on which the path joins the cycle, leading to the previous case.\nWith some simple data structures to keep track of the colors that are used and available at each vertex, the construction of {{mvar|P}} and the recoloring steps of the algorithm can all be implemented in time {{math|O(''n'')}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of vertices in the input graph. Since these steps need to be repeated {{mvar|m}} times, with each repetition increasing the number of colored edges by one, the total time is {{math|O(''mn'')}}.\n\nIn an unpublished technical report, {{harvtxt|Gabow|Nishizeki|Kariv|Leven|1985}} claimed a faster <math>O(m\\sqrt n\\log n)</math> time bound for the same problem of coloring with  {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors.\n\n==History==\nIn both {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, Vizing mentions that his work was motivated by a theorem of {{harvtxt|Shannon|1949}} showing that multigraphs could be colored with at most {{math|(3/2)\u0394}} colors. Although Vizing's theorem is now standard material in many graph theory textbooks, Vizing had trouble publishing the result initially, and his paper on it appears in an obscure journal, ''Diskret. Analiz''.<ref>The full name of this journal was ''Akademiya Nauk SSSR. Sibirskoe Otdelenie. Institut Matematiki. Diskretny\u02d8\u0131 Analiz. Sbornik Trudov''.

Vizing]] who published it in 1964.\n\n==Examples==\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 1}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must itself be a matching, with no two edges adjacent, and its edge chromatic number is one. That is, all graphs with {{math|1=\u0394(''G'') = 1}} are of class one.\n\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must be a [[disjoint union]] of [[path (graph theory)|paths]] and [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]. If all cycles are even, they can be 2-edge-colored by alternating the two colors around each cycle. However, if there exists at least one odd cycle, then no 2-edge-coloring is possible. That is, a graph with {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}} is of class one if and only if it is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]].\n\n==Proof==\nThis proof is inspired by {{harvtxt|Diestel|2000}}.\n\nLet {{math|1=''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''V'',&nbsp;''E'')}} be a simple undirected graph. We proceed by induction on {{math|''m''}}, the number of edges. If the graph is empty, the theorem trivially holds. Let {{math|''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0}} and suppose a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists for all {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} where {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}}.\n\nWe say that color {{math|&alpha;&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;{1,...,\u0394+1}}} is missing in {{math|''x''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''V''}} with respect to proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring {{math|''c''}} if {{math|''c''(''xy'')&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;&alpha;}} for all {{math|''y''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;N(''x'')}}. Also, let {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''x''}} denote the unique maximal path starting in {{math|''x''}} with {{math|&alpha;}}-colored edge and alternating the colors of edges (the second edge has color {{math|&beta;}}, the third edge has color {{math|&alpha;}} and so on), its length can be {{math|0}}. Note that if {{math|''c''}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} then every vertex has a missing color with respect to {{math|''c''}}.\n\nSuppose that no proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} exists. This is equivalent to this statement:\n:(1) Let {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''}} be arbitrary proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|&beta;}} be missing from {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''c''}}. Then the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''}} ends in {{math|''x''}}.\n\nThis is equivalent, because if (1) doesn't hold, then we can interchange the colors {{math|&alpha;}} and {{math|&beta;}} on the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path and set the color of {{math|''xy''}} to be {{math|&alpha;}}, thus creating a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} from {{math|''c''}}. The other way around, if a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists, then we can delete an edge, restrict the coloring and (1) won't hold either.\n\nNow, let {{math|''xy''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} be a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing in {{math|''x''}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}. We define {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} to be a maximal sequence of neighbours of {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nWe define coloring {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} as\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''</sub>){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''+1</sub>)}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''}},\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} not defined,\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''e''){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''e'')}} otherwise.\n\nThen {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>}} due to definition of {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Also, note that the missing colors in {{math|''x''}} are the same with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nLet {{math|&beta;}} be the color missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}, then {{math|&beta;}} is also missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}. Note that {{math|&beta;}} cannot be missing in {{math|''x''}}, otherwise we could easily extend {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, therefore an edge with color {{math|&beta;}} is incident to {{math|''x''}} for all {{math|''c''<sub>''j''</sub>}}. From the maximality of {{math|''k''}}, there exists {{math|1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}. From the definition of {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} this holds: \n:{{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''k''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}\n\nLet {{math|''P''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. From (1), {{math|''P''}} has to end in {{math|''x''}}. But {{math|&alpha;}} is missing in {{math|''x''}}, so it has to end with an edge of color {{math|&beta;}}. Therefore, the last edge of {{math|''P''}} is {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>''x''}}. Now, let {{math|''P' ''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}}. Since {{math|''P' ''}} is uniquely determined and the inner edges of {{math|''P''}} are not changed in {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, the path {{math|''P' ''}} uses the same edges as {{math|''P''}} in reverse order and visits {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. The edge leading to {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} clearly has color {{math|&alpha;}}. But {{math|&beta;}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, so {{math|''P' ''}} ends in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Which is a contradiction with (1) above.\n\n==Classification of graphs==\nSeveral authors have provided additional conditions that classify some graphs as being of class one or class two, but do not provide a complete classification. For instance, if the vertices of the maximum degree {{math|\u0394}} in a graph {{mvar|G}} form an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], or more generally if the [[induced subgraph]] for this set of vertices is a forest, then {{mvar|G}} must be of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fournier|1973}}.</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Erd\u0151s|Wilson|1977}} showed that [[almost all]] graphs are of class one. That is, in the [[Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model]] of random graphs, in which all {{mvar|n}}-vertex graphs are equally likely, let {{math|''p''(''n'')}} be the probability that an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph drawn from this distribution is of class one; then {{math|''p''(''n'')}} approaches one in the limit as {{mvar|n}} goes to infinity. For more precise bounds on the rate at which {{math|''p''(''n'')}} converges to one, see {{harvtxt|Frieze|Jackson|McDiarmid|Reed|1988}}.\n\n==Planar graphs==\n{{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} showed that a [[planar graph]] is of class one if its maximum degree is at least eight.\nIn contrast, he observed that for any maximum degree in the range from two to five, there exist\nplanar graphs of class two.  For degree two, any odd cycle is such a graph, and for degree three, four, and five, these graphs can be constructed from [[platonic solid]]s by replacing a single edge by a path of two adjacent edges.\n\nIn '''Vizing's planar graph conjecture''', {{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} states that all simple, planar graphs with maximum degree six or seven are of class one, closing the remaining possible cases.\n{{harvtxt|Sanders|Zhao|2001}} partially proved Vizing's planar graph conjecture by showing that all planar graphs with maximum degree seven are of class one.\nThus, the only case of the conjecture that remains unsolved is that of maximum degree six. This conjecture has implications for the [[Total coloring|total coloring conjecture]].\n\nThe planar graphs of class two constructed by subdivision of the platonic solids are not regular: they have vertices of degree two as well as vertices of higher degree.\nThe [[four color theorem]] (proved by {{harvtxt|Appel|Haken|1976}}) on vertex coloring of planar graphs, is equivalent to the statement that every bridgeless 3-regular planar graph is of class one {{harv|Tait|1880}}.\n\n==Graphs on nonplanar surfaces==\nIn 1969, [[Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum]] conjectured that every 3-regular graph with a polyhedral embedding on any two-dimensional [[oriented manifold]] such as a [[torus]] must be of class one. In this context, a polyhedral embedding is a [[graph embedding]] such that every face of the embedding is topologically a disk and such that the [[dual graph]] of the embedding is simple, with no self-loops or multiple adjacencies. If true, this would be a generalization of the four color theorem, which was shown by Tait to be equivalent to the statement that  3-regular graphs with a polyhedral embedding on a [[sphere]] are of class one. However, {{harvtxt|Kochol|2009}} showed the conjecture to be false by finding [[Snark (graph theory)|snarks]] that have polyhedral embeddings on high-genus orientable surfaces. Based on this construction, he also showed that it is NP-complete to tell whether a polyhedrally embedded graph is of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kochol|2010}}.</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\n{{harvtxt|Misra|Gries|1992}} describe a polynomial time algorithm for coloring the edges of any graph with {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors, where {{math|\u0394}} is the maximum degree of the graph. That is, the algorithm uses the optimal number of colors for graphs of class two, and uses at most one more color than necessary for all graphs. Their algorithm follows the same strategy as Vizing's original proof of his theorem: it starts with an uncolored graph, and then repeatedly finds a way of recoloring the graph in order to increase the number of colored edges by one.\n\nMore specifically, suppose that {{math|''uv''}} is an uncolored edge in a partially colored graph. The algorithm of Misra and Gries may be interpreted as constructing a directed [[pseudoforest]] {{mvar|P}} (a graph in which each vertex has at most one outgoing edge) on the neighbors of {{mvar|u}}: for each neighbor {{mvar|p}} of {{mvar|u}}, the algorithm finds a color {{mvar|c}} that is not used by any of the edges incident to {{mvar|p}}, finds the vertex {{mvar|q}} (if it exists) for which edge {{mvar|uq}} has color {{mvar|c}}, and adds {{mvar|pq}} as an edge to {{mvar|P}}. There are two cases:\n*If the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} constructed in this way contains a path from {{mvar|v}} to a vertex {{mvar|w}} that has no outgoing edges in {{mvar|P}}, then there is a color {{mvar|c}} that is available both at {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|w}}. Recoloring edge {{mvar|uw}} with color {{mvar|c}} allows the remaining edge colors to be shifted one step along this path: for each vertex {{mvar|p}} in the path, edge {{mvar|up}} takes the color that was previously used by the successor of {{mvar|p}} in the path. This leads to a new coloring that includes edge {{mvar|uv}}.\n*If, on the other hand, the path starting from {{mvar|v}} in the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} leads to a cycle, let {{mvar|w}} be the neighbor of {{mvar|u}} at which the path joins the cycle, let {{mvar|c}} be the color of edge {{mvar|uw}}, and let {{mvar|d}} be a color that is not used by any of the edges at vertex {{mvar|u}}. Then swapping colors {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|d}} on a [[Kempe chain]] either breaks the cycle or the edge on which the path joins the cycle, leading to the previous case.\nWith some simple data structures to keep track of the colors that are used and available at each vertex, the construction of {{mvar|P}} and the recoloring steps of the algorithm can all be implemented in time {{math|O(''n'')}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of vertices in the input graph. Since these steps need to be repeated {{mvar|m}} times, with each repetition increasing the number of colored edges by one, the total time is {{math|O(''mn'')}}.\n\nIn an unpublished technical report, {{harvtxt|Gabow|Nishizeki|Kariv|Leven|1985}} claimed a faster <math>O(m\\sqrt n\\log n)</math> time bound for the same problem of coloring with  {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors.\n\n==History==\nIn both {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, Vizing mentions that his work was motivated by a theorem of {{harvtxt|Shannon|1949}} showing that multigraphs could be colored with at most {{math|(3/2)\u0394}} colors. Although Vizing's theorem is now standard material in many graph theory textbooks, Vizing had trouble publishing the result initially, and his paper on it appears in an obscure journal, ''Diskret. Analiz''.<ref>The full name of this journal was ''Akademiya Nauk SSSR. Sibirskoe Otdelenie. Institut Matematiki. Diskretny\u02d8\u0131 Analiz. Sbornik Trudov''. It was renamed ''Metody Diskretnogo Analiza'' in 1980 (the name given for it in {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}}) and discontinued in 1991 [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/journaldoc.html?jc=DISKA].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Brooks' theorem]] relating vertex colorings to maximum degree\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Appel | first1 = K. | author1-link = Kenneth Appel\n | last2 = Haken | first2 = W. | author2-link = Wolfgang Haken\n | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1976-14122-5\n | issue = 5\n | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society\n | mr = 0424602\n | pages = 711\u2013712\n | title = Every planar map is four colorable\n | volume = 82\n | year = 1976}}.\n*{{Citation | last1=Diestel | first1=Reinhard | title=Graph Theory | pages=103\u2013104| url=http://www.esi2.us.es/~mbilbao/pdffiles/DiestelGT.pdf | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin, New York | year=2000 }}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Erd\u0151s | first1 = Paul | authorlink1 = Paul Erd\u0151s\n | last2 = Wilson | first2 = Robin J.\n | year = 1977\n | title = Note on the chromatic index of almost all graphs\n | journal = [[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]] | series = Series B\n | volume = 23\n | pages = 255\u2013257\n | url = http://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1977-20.pdf\n | doi = 10.1016/0095-8956(77)90039-9\n | issue = 2\u20133}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Fournier | first = Jean-Claude\n | journal = Cahiers du Centre d'\u00c9tudes de Recherche Op\u00e9rationnelle\n | mr = 0349458\n | pages = 311\u2013314\n | title = Colorations des ar\u00eates d'un graphe\n | volume = 15\n | year = 1973}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Frieze | first1 = Alan M. | author1-link = Alan M.
