There are two large storage lakes that can be used to supplement the supply during these periods.\n\n====Hutt River catchment====\nThe [[Hutt River (New Zealand)|Hutt river]] water supply catchment covers almost 9,000 hectares of bush-clad mountains and valleys at the southern edge of the [[Tararua Forest Park]] and adjoining the [[Kaitoke Regional Park]]. Rainwater from tributary streams flows into the Hutt River and is intercepted at a [[weir]] at [[Kaitoke]], north of [[Upper Hutt]].  The water is then strained to remove sticks, leaves and silt, and piped through tunnels to the [[Te Marua]] Water Treatment Plant. Up to 150 million litres of water per day may be diverted from the Hutt River, provided an adequate flow is maintained downstream of the weir. The Hutt water supply catchment provides about 40 percent of the water used in the Wellington urban area each year.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\n====Macaskill storage lakes====\nThere are two large storage lakes at Te Marua - the Macaskill Lakes. These lakes are filled from the Hutt River intake when the water is clean and there is sufficient flow available. Stored water is pumped from the lakes into the treatment plant when there is not enough water in the river to meet public demand.  The storage lakes are also used to meet demand when the river is too dirty - after heavy rainfall - or when it is in flood and the intake is closed to prevent rocks and gravel from entering the intake pipes.\n\nThe Macaskill Lakes are 17.3 metres deep and have a combined usable capacity of approximately 3,350 million litres, or enough to meet average water use for around 23 days.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\nBuilding the lakes was first proposed in 1975. The construction of the two lakes proved difficult because of weather and on-site conditions, resulting in cost increases and litigation.  There were also problems with leaks after completion, leading to further litigation.\n<ref>{{cite news |last= O'Neill |first= Andrea |title= Upper Hutt lakes leak water and money |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/69822534/upper-hutt-lakes-leak-water-and-money---150-years-of-news |work= Stuff |location= |date= 30 Jun 2015|access-date= 7 Apr 2020 | archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412011422/https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/69822534/upper-hutt-lakes-leak-water-and-money---150-years-of-news |archive-date=12 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Wainuiomata/Orongorongo rivers====\nThe Wainuiomata/Orongorongo water supply catchment area lies within the [[Remutaka Range]]s to the east of [[Wainuiomata]]. The collection area covers 7,600 hectares. Five low dams (weirs) with intake pipes provide water from the rivers to the Wainuiomata Water Treatment Plant. These catchment areas provide approximately 20% of the water used in the Wellington urban area each year.<ref name=\"Sources\"/>\n\n====Waiwhetu aquifer====\nThe Waiwhetu [[artesian aquifer]] is a zone of water-retaining sand, gravel and boulders beneath the Hutt Valley. Water from the Hutt River starts to flow underground around Taita Gorge. From Melling southwards, the water becomes naturally pressurised beneath a layer of hard clay. This pressurised zone, the Waiwhetu artesian aquifer, stretches as far south as the harbour. It is estimated to be up to 70 metres thick at its western edge against the Wellington fault line, and 20 metres thick at the eastern edge of the harbour. The pressure in the aquifer has resulted in several fresh water springs in the harbour floor.\n\nWater takes more than 12 months to pass through the aquifer to wells where it is extracted for distribution via the water network. Extraction is monitored and controlled to minimise the risk of [[saline intrusion]]. The Waiwhetu aquifer provides around 40 percent of the annual water supply.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\nThe Te Puna Wai Ora (Spring of Life) in Buick Street, [[Petone]] provides untreated water from the aquifer free to the public. \n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.jacksonstreet.co.nz/listing/te-puna-wai-ora-spring-of-life/\n| title= Te Puna Wai Ora (Spring of Life)| publisher= Jackson Street Program| archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200409022604/https://www.jacksonstreet.co.nz/listing/te-puna-wai-ora-spring-of-life/|archive-date=9 April 2020| accessdate=9 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.huttvalleynz.com/upload/documents/petone_water.pdf| title= Hutt City - Petone's Artesian Water |publisher= Hutt City Council |date=13 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513230407/http://www.huttvalleynz.com/upload/documents/Petone_water.pdf|archive-date= 5 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Water sources for remaining areas===\n\nThe water sources for the South Wairarapa District Council area are the [[Waiohine River|Waiohine]] catchment for Featherston, the Kuratawhiti Street bore for Greytown residents, and the Herricks bore field for users in Martinborough. \n<ref name=\"SWDC\">{{cite web| url=https://www.swdc.govt.nz/water-and-sewerage#water| title= Water and sewerage| publisher= South Wairarapa District Council | accessdate=7 Apr 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200409085630/https://www.swdc.govt.nz/water-and-sewerage |archive-date=9 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\nWater supplies for the Kapiti Coast region are sourced from combination of bores and surface water from the [[Waikanae]] River.\n<ref name=\"Kapiti_water\">{{cite web| url=https://www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/services/a-z-council-services-and-facilities/water/| title= Water supply| publisher= Kapiti Coast District Council | accessdate=10 Apr 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091317/https://www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/services/a-z-council-services-and-facilities/water/ |archive-date=10 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\nWater supply for the Carterton district comes from the Kaipatangata Stream and two underground bores.\n<ref name=\"Carterton_water\">{{cite web| url=https://cdc.govt.nz/services/water | title= Water supply| publisher= Carterton District Council | accessdate=10 Apr 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091614/https://cdc.govt.nz/services/water/ |archive-date=10 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\nMasterton's drinking water is sourced Waingawa River, about 10&nbsp;km west of Masterton.\n<ref name=\"Masterton_water\">{{cite web| url=https://mstn.govt.nz/services/water-services/| title= Services - Water| publisher= Masterton District Council | accessdate=10 Apr 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091846/https://mstn.govt.nz/services/water-services/%7C |archive-date=10 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Water treatment===\n====Wellington urban area====\nThere are four [[Water purification|water treatment]] plants located in the Hutt Valley (Te Marua, Waterloo, Gear Island and Wainuiomata).

The base case studies show that in a major earthquake, the Wellington region would be likely to lose its water supplies for a period of between 3 and 6 months, with treated water potentially not available for up to 12 months.  A wide range of risk mitigation projects were identified and included in modelling to show the potential improvements in resilience.  The risk mitigation projects included works to reduce the risk posed to the bulk water supply that runs parallel to the line of the main Wellington fault.  The modelling of outages indicates that the outage time would reduce to between one and three months, if all the identified risk mitigations were implemented.\n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://wremo.nz/assets/Uploads/Wellington-Lifelines-PBC-MAIN-Combined-20191009.pdf| title= Wellington Lifelines Project - Regional Resilience Report | publisher= Wellington Region Emergency Management Office| date= Oct 2019| accessdate=11 Apr 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200411040711/https://wremo.nz/assets/Uploads/Wellington-Lifelines-PBC-MAIN-Combined-20191009.pdf |archive-date=11 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe report called on its 16 member organisations to help deliver 25 key infrastructure projects across the region over the next two decades, at a cost of $5.3b.

This study estimated that for a magnitude 7.5 Richter scale earthquake, there would be about 30 breaks on the main trunk pipelines and 60 breaks on the smaller branch lines. There could be as many as 8,000 breaks in the Wellington City local supply network. Bulk water supply and treatment facilities are also expected to suffer damage requiring repair. Wellington Water and Greater Wellington Regional Council estimated that it would take around 60\u201070 days to restore bulk water supply to parts of the Wellington metropolitan area.It could take several years to fully repair damage to the local water distribution network resulting from a severe earthquake, as much of the network may have to be rebuilt.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/dmsdocument/215\n|title= Prince of Wales - Omaroro Reservoir - Town Belt Easement Request - Includes Appendix A|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 1 June 2017|website= |publisher= Wellington Water |access-date= 12 Apr 2020|quote= |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412204753/https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/dmsdocument/215|archive-date=13 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2018, an independent panel recommended that Wellington City Council confirm the designation of the easement for the reservoir.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/news/2018/05/prince-of-wales-park-reservoir\n|title= Green light for Om\u0101roro/Prince of Wales Park reservoir|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 14 May 2018|website= |publisher= Wellington City Council |access-date= 12 Apr 2020|quote= |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412212844/https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/news/2018/05/prince-of-wales-park-reservoir|archive-date=13 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe reservoir provides a significant increase in water storage for the city, and forms part of the city's resilience strategy to help ensure that fresh water is available to residents after a natural disaster or major network failure.\n\nPreparatory earthworks for the project commenced in February 2019.\n<ref>{{cite news |last= Hunt|first=Tom |date= 5 Feb 2019|title=  Reservoir earthworks marks beginning of Wellington's Mt Cook becoming a 'building-site suburb'|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/110374164/reservoir-earthworks-marks-beginning-of-wellingtons-mt-cook-becoming-a-buildingsite-suburb|work= Stuff|location= |access-date=12 Apr 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412010647/https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/110374164/reservoir-earthworks-marks-beginning-of-wellingtons-mt-cook-becoming-a-buildingsite-suburb|archive-date=12 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Stormwater==\n\n===Pipeline age and condition===\nThe 2018/19 National Performance Review published by Water New Zealand compares the average stormwater pipeline age and condition across networks. The data for the Wellington Water network shows that 16% of the pipelines are in poor or very poor condition.  The Wellington stormwater network ranks the worst on this measure out of the six large networks nationwide.\n<ref name=\"Pipeline_condition\" />\nThe review also includes average pipeline age. The Wellington stormwater network has an average age of 49 years, and ranks as the second oldest of the six large networks.\n<ref name=\"Pipeline_age\" />\n\n==Wastewater==\nProperties in urban areas in the Wellington Region are generally all connected to a wastewater system via a [[gravity sewer]].  In some cases, pumps are used to pump wastewater to a treatment plant, or to lift wastewater from lower level drains into a higher elevation gravity sewer so that it can flow to a treatment plant. \n===Wellington urban area===\nWellington's population grew rapidly in the late 19th century after it became the capital city in 1865.\nThere were increasing cases of typhoid and cholera which were attributed to poor sanitation. In 1879 there were 75 deaths in Wellington from typhoid, diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles and cholera \u2013 mostly in the central Te Aro area. \n<ref>{{cite web| last= Roberts| first=Sofia|url=https://www.museumswellington.org.nz/wellingtons-unsightly-and-smelly-past/| title= Wellington\u2019s unsightly and smelly past | publisher= Museums Wellington| accessdate=14 Apr 2020 }}</ref>\nAfter some political deliberation, construction of a city wastewater network began in 1893. It cost \u00a3175,000 and was completed by 1899.\n\n====The interceptor====\nA large pipe was constructed to take wastewater from Manners St through Mt Victoria and out to the south coast.  This main trunk wastewater line was known as \"the interceptor\". In the 1930s the interceptor was extended from Manners St through to Pipitea St, as the city's population topped 100,000.\nAs suburbs spread further north to [[Johnsonville]], another extension of the interceptor was made from [[Ngauranga Gorge]] and through [[Ngaio, New Zealand|Ngaio]] Gorge to connect at [[Thorndon]].\n\n====Wastewater treatment====\nThere are four wastewater treatment plants serving the Wellington urban area.\nTogether, they treat about 150 million litres of wastewater on a typical day, using biological and ultraviolet treatment processes. The treated water is discharged to the sea. The sludge resulting from filtration and treatment is de-watered (with this water further treated) and the solid content is sent to landfills.\n<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.learnz.org.nz/water172/bg-standard-f/wastewater/| title= Wastewater | publisher= LEARNZ| accessdate=14 Apr 2020 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/your-water/wastewater/where-does-wastewater-go/| title= Where does wastewater go| publisher= Wellington Water| accessdate=14 Apr 2020 }}</ref>\n\n====Moa Point====\nThe Moa Point treatment plant handles all the wastewater from most of Wellington city, other than Karori and some northern suburbs.  Treated wastewater is discharged via a 1.8&nbsp;km ocean outfall into Cook Strait.  Sludge is separated from the wastewater at the plant, and pumped to a landfill site at Carey's Gully, where it is dewatered and placed into a landfill.\n\n====Seaview====\nThe Seaview plant handles wastewater from Upper Hutt and Lower Hutt.  There is an ocean outfall at Pencarrow Head.\n\n====Porirua====\nA treatment plant located at Rukutane Point handles wastewater from the northern suburbs of Wellington and Porirua city.  There is an ocean outfall from the plant.\n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/pwp/the-wastewater-system/| title= Your wastewater system | publisher= Wellington Water| accessdate=14 Apr 2020 }}</ref>\n\n====Karori====\nA separate wastewater and treatment system serves the Karori area.  Treated wastewater is piped out to the South Coast.\n\n===Pipeline age and condition===\nThe 2018/19 National Performance Review published by Water New Zealand compares the average wastewater pipeline age and condition across networks. The data for the Wellington Water network shows that 33% of the pipelines are in poor or very poor condition. The Wellington wastewater network ranks the worst on this measure out of the six large networks nationwide. (The next worst is Christchurch, with only 12% in poor or very poor condition).\n<ref name=\"Pipeline_condition\" />\nThe review also includes average pipeline age. The Wellington wastewater network has an average age of 53 years, and ranks as the second oldest of the six large networks.\n<ref name=\"Pipeline_age\" />\n\n===Significant incidents===\n\n====South Wairarapa====\nAlmost half a million litres of partially and fully treated wastewater was discharged into the [[Ruamahanga River]] near Martinborough in two incidents in January 2020, as a result of issues at a treatment plant. Under suitable conditions, discharging fully treated wastewater to the river is a consented activity.  However, when the river level is low, as in this case, this type of discharge is a breach of the resource consent.\n<ref>{{cite news |last= Anselm|first= Marcus|date= 18 Jan 2020|title= Water problems continue in south|url= https://times-age.co.nz/water-problems-continue-in-south/|work= Wairarapa Times-Age|location= |access-date= 12 Apr 2020|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200411214833/https://times-age.co.nz/water-problems-continue-in-south/|archive-date=12 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news |last= Campbell|first= Georgina|date= 31 Jan 2020|title= Second wastewater discharge into Wairarapa river this year raises concerns|url= https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12305059 |work= NZ Herald|location= |access-date= 12 Apr 2020|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200411214943/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12305059|archive-date=12 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Wellington Water]]\n* [[Water in New Zealand]]\n* [[Water supply and sanitation in New Zealand]]\n* [[Water purification]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz// Wellington Water]\n* [https://www.dia.govt.nz/Three-waters-review Three Waters Review] at the Department of Internal Affairs\n* [https://www.waternz.org.nz/  Water New Zealand (New Zealand Water and Wastes Association)]\n* [https://www.gw.govt.nz/history-of-our-water-supply History of our water supply] at the Greater Wellington Regional Council\n* [http://www.gw.govt.nz/assets/council-publications/Regional%20Parks_20011127_163445.pdf Wonderful Water Walks - A History of Water Supply Dams in the Wellington Region] at the Greater Wellington Regional Council\n\n[[Category:Water supply and sanitation in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Wellington Region]]\n", "text_old": "'''Water supply and sanitation in the Wellington region''' involves the provision of the \"three waters\" - [[drinking water]], [[stormwater]], and [[wastewater]] services in the Greater Wellington region.  \n\nThe provision of these services in the Wellington urban area is the responsibility of five councils: [[Wellington City Council|Wellington City]], [[Lower Hutt|Hutt]], [[Upper Hutt]] and [[Porirua]] city councils, and the [[Wellington Region|Greater Wellington]] Regional Council.

The pipelines are in significantly worse condition than those in other large networks nationwide, and there has been a recent history of serious failures.  The water supply to the region is also at significant risk during a severe earthquake, although some projects are underway to improve resilience.\n\nWater supplies to the Wellington urban area meet the requirements of the Health Act and conform with drinking water standards.  However, for some of the towns in the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa regions, there have been occasional non-conformances with the required standards for drinking water quality and safety.\n\nBenchmarking data published by Water New Zealand as part of their 2018/19 National Performance Review showed that capital expenditure on three waters assets in the Wellington urban area is well below the average of the expenditure on networks in most other major centres, and for the wastewater network, expenditure was the lowest out of the seven large networks in the review.\n<ref name=\"Capex>{{cite web| url=https://www.waternz.org.nz/Category?Action=View&Category_id=1018| title= Annual capital expenditure per property connected to the network| publisher= Water New Zealand| accessdate=13 Apr 2020 }}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==Drinking water==\n===Regional water supply networks===\nThe supply of reticulated drinking water is regulated under the Health Act, and suppliers are registered and subject to a testing regime.

There are two large storage lakes that can be used to supplement the supply during these periods.\n\n====Hutt River catchment====\nThe [[Hutt River (New Zealand)|Hutt river]] water supply catchment covers almost 9,000 hectares of bush-clad mountains and valleys at the southern edge of the [[Tararua Forest Park]] and adjoining the [[Kaitoke Regional Park]]. Rainwater from tributary streams flows into the Hutt River and is intercepted at a [[weir]] at [[Kaitoke]], north of [[Upper Hutt]].  The water is then strained to remove sticks, leaves and silt, and piped through tunnels to the [[Te Marua]] Water Treatment Plant. Up to 150 million litres of water per day may be diverted from the Hutt River, provided an adequate flow is maintained downstream of the weir. The Hutt water supply catchment provides about 40 percent of the water used in the Wellington urban area each year. <ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\n====Macaskill storage lakes====\nThere are two large storage lakes at Te Marua - the Macaskill Lakes. These lakes are filled from the Hutt River intake when the water is clean and there is sufficient flow available. Stored water is pumped from the lakes into the treatment plant when there is not enough water in the river to meet public demand.  The storage lakes are also used to meet demand when the river is too dirty - after heavy rainfall - or when it is in flood and the intake is closed to prevent rocks and gravel from entering the intake pipes.\n\nThe Macaskill Lakes are 17.3 metres deep and have a combined useable capacity of approximately 3,350 million litres, or enough to meet average water use for around 23 days.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\nBuilding the lakes was first proposed in 1975. The construction of the two lakes proved difficult because of weather and on-site conditions, resulting in cost increases and litigation.  There were also problems with leaks after completion, leading to further litigation.\n<ref>{{cite news |last= O'Neill |first= Andrea |title= Upper Hutt lakes leak water and money |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/69822534/upper-hutt-lakes-leak-water-and-money---150-years-of-news |work= Stuff |location= |date= 30 Jun 2015|access-date= 7 Apr 2020 | archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412011422/https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/69822534/upper-hutt-lakes-leak-water-and-money---150-years-of-news |archive-date=12 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Wainuiomata/Orongorongo rivers====\nThe Wainuiomata/Orongorongo water supply catchment area lies within the [[Remutaka Range|Remutaka Ranges]] to the east of [[Wainuiomata]]. The collection area covers 7,600 hectares. Five low dams (weirs) with intake pipes provide water from the rivers to the Wainuiomata Water Treatment Plant. These catchment areas provide approximately 20% of the water used in the Wellington urban area each year.<ref name=\"Sources\"/>\n\n====Waiwhetu aquifer====\nThe Waiwhetu [[artesian aquifer]] is a zone of water-retaining sand, gravel and boulders beneath the Hutt Valley. Water from the Hutt River starts to flow underground around Taita Gorge. From Melling southwards, the water becomes naturally pressurised beneath a layer of hard clay. This pressurised zone, the Waiwhetu artesian aquifer, stretches as far south as the harbour. It is estimated to be up to 70 metres thick at its western edge against the Wellington fault line, and 20 metres thick at the eastern edge of the harbour. The pressure in the aquifer has resulted in several fresh water springs in the harbour floor.\n\nWater takes more than 12 months to pass through the aquifer to wells where it is extracted for distribution via the water network. Extraction is monitored and controlled to minimise the risk of [[saline intrusion]]. The Waiwhetu aquifer provides around 40 percent of the annual water supply. <ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\nThe Te Puna Wai Ora (Spring of Life) in Buick Street, [[Petone]] provides untreated water from the aquifer free to the public. \n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.jacksonstreet.co.nz/listing/te-puna-wai-ora-spring-of-life/\n| title= Te Puna Wai Ora (Spring of Life)| publisher= Jackson Street Program| archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200409022604/https://www.jacksonstreet.co.nz/listing/te-puna-wai-ora-spring-of-life/|archive-date=9 April 2020| accessdate=9 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.huttvalleynz.com/upload/documents/petone_water.pdf| title= Hutt City - Petone's Artesian Water |publisher= Hutt City Council |date=13 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513230407/http://www.huttvalleynz.com/upload/documents/Petone_water.pdf|archive-date= 5 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Water sources for remaining areas===\n\nThe water sources for the South Wairarapa District Council area are the [[Waiohine River| Waiohine]] catchment for Featherston, the Kuratawhiti Street bore for Greytown residents, and the Herricks bore field for users in Martinborough. \n<ref name=\"SWDC\">{{cite web| url=https://www.swdc.govt.nz/water-and-sewerage#water| title= Water and sewerage| publisher= South Wairarapa District Council | accessdate=7 Apr 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200409085630/https://www.swdc.govt.nz/water-and-sewerage |archive-date=9 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\nWater supplies for the Kapiti Coast region are sourced from combination of bores and surface water from the [[Waikanae]] River.\n<ref name=\"Kapiti_water\">{{cite web| url=https://www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/services/a-z-council-services-and-facilities/water/| title= Water supply| publisher= Kapiti Coast District Council | accessdate=10 Apr 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091317/https://www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/services/a-z-council-services-and-facilities/water/ |archive-date=10 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\nWater supply for the Carterton district comes from the Kaipatangata Stream and two underground bores.\n<ref name=\"Carterton_water\">{{cite web| url=https://cdc.govt.nz/services/water | title= Water supply| publisher= Carterton District Council | accessdate=10 Apr 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091614/https://cdc.govt.nz/services/water/ |archive-date=10 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\nMasterton's drinking water is sourced Waingawa River, about 10 km west of Masterton.\n<ref name=\"Masterton_water\">{{cite web| url=https://mstn.govt.nz/services/water-services/| title= Services - Water| publisher= Masterton District Council | accessdate=10 Apr 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091846/https://mstn.govt.nz/services/water-services/%7C |archive-date=10 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Water treatment===\n====Wellington urban area====\nThere are four [[Water purification|water treatment]] plants located in the Hutt Valley (Te Marua, Waterloo, Gear Island and Wainuiomata).

The base case studies show that in a major earthquake, the Wellington region would be likely to lose its water supplies for a period of between 3 and 6 months, with treated water potentially not available for up to 12 months.  A wide range of risk mitigation projects were identified and included in modelling to show the potential improvements in resilience.  The risk mitigation projects included works to reduce the risk posed to the bulk water supply that runs parallel to the line of the main Wellington fault.  The modelling of outages indicates that the outage time would reduce to between one and three months, if all the identified risk mitigations were implemented.\n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://wremo.nz/assets/Uploads/Wellington-Lifelines-PBC-MAIN-Combined-20191009.pdf| title= Wellington Lifelines Project - Regional Resilience Report | publisher= Wellington Region Emergency Management Office| date= Oct 2019| accessdate=11 Apr 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200411040711/https://wremo.nz/assets/Uploads/Wellington-Lifelines-PBC-MAIN-Combined-20191009.pdf |archive-date=11 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe report called on its 16 member organisations to help deliver 25 key infrastructure projects across the region over the next two decades, at a cost of $5.3b.

This study estimated that for a magnitude 7.5 Richter scale earthquake, there would be about 30 breaks on the main trunk pipelines and 60 breaks on the smaller branch lines. There could be as many as 8,000 breaks in the Wellington City local supply network. Bulk water supply and treatment facilities are also expected to suffer damage requiring repair. Wellington Water and Greater Wellington Regional Council estimated that it would take around 60\u201070 days to restore bulk water supply to parts of the Wellington metropolitan area.It could take several years to fully repair damage to the local water distribution network resulting from a severe earthquake, as much of the network may have to be rebuilt.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/dmsdocument/215\n|title= Prince of Wales - Omaroro Reservoir - Town Belt Easement Request - Includes Appendix A|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 1 June 2017|website= |publisher= Wellington Water |access-date= 12 Apr 2020|quote= |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412204753/https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/dmsdocument/215|archive-date=13 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2018, an independent panel recommended that Wellington City Council confirm the designation of the easement for the reservoir.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/news/2018/05/prince-of-wales-park-reservoir\n|title= Green light for Om\u0101roro/Prince of Wales Park reservoir|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 14 May 2018|website= |publisher= Wellington City Council |access-date= 12 Apr 2020|quote= |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412212844/https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/news/2018/05/prince-of-wales-park-reservoir|archive-date=13 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe reservoir provides a significant increase in water storage for the city, and forms part of the city\u2019s resilience strategy to help ensure that fresh water is available to residents after a natural disaster or major network failure. \n\nPreparatory earthworks for the project commenced in February 2019.\n<ref>{{cite news |last= Hunt|first=Tom |date= 5 Feb 2019|title=  Reservoir earthworks marks beginning of Wellington's Mt Cook becoming a 'building-site suburb'|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/110374164/reservoir-earthworks-marks-beginning-of-wellingtons-mt-cook-becoming-a-buildingsite-suburb|work= Stuff|location= |access-date=12 Apr 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412010647/https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/110374164/reservoir-earthworks-marks-beginning-of-wellingtons-mt-cook-becoming-a-buildingsite-suburb|archive-date=12 Apr 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Stormwater==\n\n\n===Pipeline age and condition===\nThe 2018/19 National Performance Review published by Water New Zealand compares the average stormwater pipeline age and condition across networks.

This main trunk wastewater line was known as \"the interceptor\". In the 1930s the interceptor was extended from Manners St through to Pipitea St, as the city's population topped 100,000.\nAs suburbs spread further north to [[Johnsonville]], another extension of the interceptor was made from [[Ngauranga Gorge]] and through [[Ngaio, New Zealand|Ngaio]] Gorge to connect at [[Thorndon]].\n\n====Wastewater treatment====\nThere are four wastewater treatment plants serving the Wellington urban area.\nTogether, they treat about 150 million litres of wastewater on a typical day, using biological and ultraviolet treatment processes. The treated water is discharged to the sea. The sludge resulting from filtration and treatment is de-watered (with this water further treated) and the solid content is sent to landfills.\n<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.learnz.org.nz/water172/bg-standard-f/wastewater/| title= Wastewater | publisher= LEARNZ| accessdate=14 Apr 2020 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/your-water/wastewater/where-does-wastewater-go/| title= Where does wastewater go| publisher= Wellington Water| accessdate=14 Apr 2020 }}</ref>\n====Moa Point====\nThe Moa Point treatment plant handles all the wastewater from most of Wellington city, other than Karori and some northern suburbs.
