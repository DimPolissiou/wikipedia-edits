determined that while the blackout was initiated by the equipment failure, the root cause was a widespread lack of coordination between the various companies in the day-to-day operations of the electricity sector. As a result, the SEC laid charges against all 115 companies involved in the electrical sector.\n\nThe charges were as follows:\n\n*Each company did not coordinate its day-to-day operations to account for possible events, such as unforeseen transmission line failures.\n*Each company did not coordinate any necessary actions with others in the electrical system to ensure the safety of the overall electrical system.\n*Each company did not ensure the safe and efficient operation of the electrical system according to the established general criteria.\n*Each company did not have established procedures in place for coordinated operation with other companies when needed to ensure system security or when required to maintain quality of service.\n\nAdditional charges were filed against [[Endesa (Chile)]], Transquillota, CHILECTRA, and TRANSELEC for either equipment failures in owned facilities or for failure to provide adequate information to Chile's central electrical grid system operator, Center for Economic Load Dispatch (CDEC-SIC). Further charges were also laid for issues at the Alto Jahuel high voltage electrical substation, located south of Santiago, which led to undue delays in recovery of the Metropolitan Region.\n\nThe Superintendent of the SEC, Patricia Chotzen, said that \"after the technical analysis of the background, as part of a complex investigation, we decided to press charges against the companies involved whom have not made the necessary arrangements, referred to in our regulations.\"\n\nAsked about whether the blackout may have been caused by the earthquake which had occurred two weeks previous, Chotzen said that \"after an event of the magnitude of the earthquake of February, the companies had a duty to increase their level of coordination to avoid a collapse like this one. It is the duty of the utilities that provide a service as fundamental as electricity to ensure continuous and safe supply.\" The current legislation provided for fines of up to 10 000 AWU.<ref name=\"SEC formula cargos en contra de 115 empresas el\u00e9ctricas, 2010-08-02\">{{cite news |title=SEC formula cargos en contra de 115 empresas el\u00e9ctricas|url=http://www.sec.cl/pls/portal/SITIO_WEB.BLACKOUT.show|date=2 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Electricity sector in Chile]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Wikinews|Power outage affects many areas of Chile}}\n{{Portal|Chile|Energy}}\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Energy in Chile}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:March 2010 Chile Blackout}}\n[[Category:Power outages in Chile]]\n[[Category:2010 Chile earthquake|Blackout]]\n[[Category:2010 in Chile|blackout]]\n[[Category:March 2010 events in South America]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{Multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction      = vertical\n | width          = 250\n | header   = Blackout: before and after\n | image1    = Santiago sur segundos antes del apag\u00f3n.jpg\n | caption1   = Southern Santiago prior to blackout.\n | image2    = Santiago sur a oscuras.jpg\n | caption2   = Southern Santiago during the blackout.\n}}\nThe '''2010 Chile blackout''' was an electric [[power outage]] that affected most of [[Chile]] on March 14, 2010.

It found that three employees had tried to deflect the couple's plans, told them ACORN could not offer them help on the grounds they wanted, and otherwise dealt with them appropriately. Such context was not reflected in O'Keefe's edited tapes. The AG's Report noted that \"O'Keefe stated that he was out to make a point and to damage ACORN and therefore did not act as a journalist objectively reporting a story\". It found no evidence of intent by the employees to aid the couple. The report also noted \"a serious and glaring deficit in management, governance and accountability within the ACORN organization\" and said its conduct \"suggests an organizational ethos at odds with the norms of American society. Empowering and serving low-and moderate-income families cannot be squared with counseling and encouraging illegal activities.\"<ref name=\"CA AG Report\"/>\n\nOn the basis of the edited videotape which O'Keefe released, Vera appeared to be a willing participant in helping with O'Keefe's plan to smuggle young women into the United States illegally.

Due to O'Keefe's release of the dubiously edited video, intentionally designed to \"prove\" that ACORN employees were ready and willing to engage in illicit activities, Mr. Vera lost his job and was falsely accused of being engaged in human trafficking. O'Keefe noted that he \"regrets any pain\" caused by his reckless actions, though O'Keefe's lawyer dismissed any claimed injury incurred by Vera and stated that the payment was a \"nuisance settlement\".<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2013/03/08/james-okeefe-pays-100000-to-acorn-employee-he-smeared-conservative-media-yawns O'Keefe pays $100,000 to ACORN employee he smeared - conservative media yawns\"], forbes.com, March 8, 2013; accessed August 24, 2015.</ref>\n\nO'Keefe moved for [[summary judgment]] in his favor, arguing that the plaintiff had no reasonable expectation that the conversation would be private.

Following his previous strategy, he sent the releases to conservative outlets over a period of weeks. In July 2011, two conservative groups released a secretly recorded video of an encounter in Maine's Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIn the video, an actor attempted to apply for benefits while hinting that he was a drug smuggler. [[Americans for Prosperity]] and O'Keefe said he had similar recorded videos from offices in Ohio, Virginia and South Carolina, and believed that there was a systemic problem. In Maine, Governor [[Paul LePage]] concluded upon further examination of the videos that there was no fraud or intent to commit fraud.<!-- proper wording in line with quote from LePage --><ref name=\"portlandpressherald\">Rebekah Metzler,[http://www.pressherald.com/news/sting-video-stirs-fraud-debate-_2011-08-12.html \"'Sting' Video Stirs Fraud Debate\"], ''Portland Press Herald'', August 12, 2011; accessed September 15, 2011.</ref><ref name=\"Chafets\"/><ref name=\"WCSH\">Ken Christian.

In 1799 was taken to Naples and here the attribution to Sofonisba Anguissola was lost.<ref>Bora, p. 87</ref>\n\nFrom a letter written by Tommaso Cavalieri to [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]], on 20 January 1562, accompanying the gift of two drawings (one of which was the ''Old Woman Studying the Alphabet and Laughing Girl'' by Sofonisba Anguissola and the other was ''Cleopatra'' di [[Michelangelo|Michelangelo Buonarroti]]), we know that ''Child Bitten by A Lobster'' has been made on the suggestion of Michelangelo - to whom it has been sent for viewing - and depicted Asdrubale, the younger brother of Sofonisba (born in 1551):\n\n{{Quote|&nbsp;Having a drawing by the hand of the Cremonese noble woman called Sofhonisba Angosciosa [sic], today a lady in waiting for the Queen of Spain, I sent it was this [a Cleopatra by Michelangelo] and I believe that it is of equal merit to many other drawings, not only because it is beautifulm but it is also inventive, and this is something that the divine Michelangelo, having seeing a drawing by her hand of a laughing boy, said that he wanted to see a crying putto as that was even more difficult too, and having written this, she sent him this studied portrait of her crying brother.|author=Tommaso Cavalieri\n|title=\"Lettera\"}}\n\nAccording to Roberto Longhi, this version was originally thought it was a copy and the original drawing was in Berlin in a private collection. It was then attributed to a [[Santi di Tito]] and the Berlin drawing was then considered a copy. Engravings were made from this drawing.<ref>Longhi, pps. 97-143</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe child (Asdrubale Anguissola) has put his hand in a basket, where a lobster is hidden. He cries from the sudden pain, next to his little sister (Europa Anguissola). This drawing of the Child Bitten by a Lobster, that anticipates Caravaggio's ''[[Boy Bitten by a Lizard]]'', depicts one of the first expressions by the artist in which a sudden physical pain provokes an outpouring of grief. The naturalism, deriving from the studies of physiognomy by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], spread in 1550s Lombardy and was also taken up by Anguissola.<ref>Italian women, p. 112</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* Roberto Longhi, Me pinxit e quesiti caravaggeschi: 1928-1934, Firenze, Sansoni, 1968, SBN IT\\ICCU\\UFI\\0150711.

The product line had an interactive website where users could chat in a forum, and click around for free things such as desktop icons and screensavers.

There isn't a single thing in the world that gets her down or a single negative that she can't turn into a positive. Her positive attitude allows her to act as the voice of reason in the mansion when her friends lose focus on real issues. Ruby has a crush on one of her friends, Skull Boy, and nearly reveals her feelings to him in the episode \"Sunny Daze\", when the two of them are trapped in a cave. Her positive outlook also makes Ruby very loyal to her friends. She likes to write in her diary and knit. Voiced by [[Sarah Gadon]].\n\n===Doom Kitty===\nAs Ruby's pet cat, Doom Kitty has a complete free run of the mansion and is therefore usually the only one with total knowledge of what is going on in any given area of the house. This keeps her one step ahead of Ruby and the others most of the time, because whenever something strange happens in the mansion, Doom Kitty will usually have all the facts already while everyone else is still trying to figure things out. Unfortunately, since Doom Kitty can't talk, her only hope of communicating with the others is through mime with [[violin]] noises. Ruby usually has an easy time understanding her, but it doesn't always work. This shows that Doom Kitty hates it when she is trying to communicate, and her friends think that she is playing charades. She sometimes tries to warn Scaredy Bat about Boo Boo's pranks.\n\n===Iris===\nLike Ruby, Iris goes through life without a care in the world, but in a much different way. Where Ruby finds happiness in anything, Iris finds adventure. From safaris to fighting wild animals to even shooting herself out of a cannon, there isn't a single thing this [[cyclops]] girl won't try at least once, as long as she thinks it's fun. Unfortunately, Iris's adventuresome nature also makes her quite impulsive and she has a bad habit of jumping into a situation without considering potential consequences. This usually results in trouble she doesn't expect. However, as soon as the trouble is gone, she's off again on another adventure. Voiced by [[Stacey DePass]].\n\n===Misery===\nMisery doesn't mean to be a walking disaster area. Her mishaps are usually a combination of clumsiness and extraordinary bad luck. Evidently, these traits run in her family, as Misery has had relatives who have been present at every single major disaster in recorded history. Fortunately, her friends are all kindhearted enough to take this in their stride. Misery spends most of the time in a state of detached apathy and with ever-present trails of tears running from her eyes. She does have tiny moments of happiness throughout the series, but alas they're few and far between, her bad luck rears its ugly head and strikes her down with a vengeance, usually in the form of lightning bolts. She is pretty much beloved by many fans due to her comic relief and cute appearance. Misery is voiced by [[Emily Hampshire]].\n\n===Skull Boy===\nA man of many talents, Skull Boy is the mansion's official Jack of All Trades. From film directing to private investigating, Skull Boy can pretty much do it all. His only problem is that he can't seem to find one thing and stick to it for any serious length of time. But if Skull Boy doesn't know where he's going, it's mostly because he doesn't know where he comes from. This is referred to in many episodes when each time he finds a new skill he surmises his must come from a long line of others with that same skill, indicating he knows little to nothing about his origins. There have been several moments that confirm that Ruby has a crush on him, such as in the episode \"Quadro-Gloomia\" when Frank and Len get inside Ruby's head and experience her feelings for Skull Boy first hand. He does share the same feelings towards Ruby, but he is clueless about her feelings.  Even though Skull Boy doesn't know where he is from, he has a family \u2013 his friends are his family. Voiced by [[Scott McCord]].\n\nIn Skull Boy's endeavor to discover his roots, he has undergone many personae and occupations. These include:\n{{div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* Action Hero\n* Animator\n* Architect\n* Army General\n* Astronomer\n* British Drummer\n* British General\n* Chef\n* Detective (Skull Spade)\n* Documentary Filmmaker\n* Etiquette Expert\n* Explorer\n* Film Director (seen in the bloopers of \"Doom With A View\" and behind the scenes of \"Seeing Eye To Eyes\")\n* French Investigator\n* Head Shrink\n* Ice Sculpture\n* Inventor\n* Jazz Musician\n* Layabout\n* Magician\n* Malt Shop Entrepreneur\n* Mechanic\n* Painter\n* Pilot\n* Psychologist\n* Ringmaster\n* R.I.P's band manager\n* Scientist\n* Shakespearean Actor\n* Sculptor\n* Tailor\n* Train Conductor\n* Train Engineer\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Frank and Len===\nRockers by nature, these conjoined brothers live in the mansion's garage. They have their own garage band, known as R.I.P (pronounced \"RIP\"). Frank and Len's strength lies in performing music. Unfortunately, this seems to be all that is their strength, since they both tend to lose focus on anything that isn't their music. They can hardly focus on something if it doesn't have a beat. Frank is actually the more intelligent of the two, often getting annoyed at Len's lack of understanding. Len is the more sentimental one, who seems to have a thing for small animals and things that don't exactly matter to anyone else. Even though they seem upbeat for their music, the two of them are almost never on the same page, even though they're conjoined. Despite this fact, Frank and Len are close. For example, in the episode \"Quadrogloomia\", when the brothers needed a way to become unconscious, they were unable to hit each other over the head with planks. Another example of this is in the episode \"Iris Springs Eternal\" where Ruby, Frank, and Len were sliding down a mud slide when Frank states, \"Len, if we don't get out of this I just want you to know that you've been the best brother a brother could have for a brother.\" Len replies with \"same here.\" Also, as of the episode \"Quadrogloomia\", Frank and Len are the only housemates (other than Doom Kitty) who know about Ruby's crush on Skull Boy. Voiced by [[David Berni]] (as Frank) and Jeremy Harris (as Len).\n\n===Edgar, Allan, and Poe===\nPoe the crow, along with his brothers Edgar and Allan, live in an attached addition to the mansion. However, out of the three, Poe is the one seen most often. Edgar and Allan are rarely seen and when they are, they never speak but act as Poe's bodyguards and servants since they are taller than him. Poe meanwhile, as a man of culture and sophistication, likes to think of himself as a role model to the rest of the mansion's residents. Unfortunately, he tends to be a little too attached to his image and likes to cover up the parts of him that make him look like less than what he makes himself out to be. For example, he'd rather tell people he's performing in an actual opera than admit that he's staying home to listen to opera records. Poe's pampered nature also tends to make him overreact to things that everyone else would more or less take in stride. There is at least some evidence that Poe's cultured accent is an affectation. In episode \"Unsung Hero\", Poe reverts to an East End accent while speaking to Skull Boy. Skull Boy remarks that Poe's Oxford accent has vanished much to Poe's discomfort. Poe is fond of claiming to be a descendant of Edgar Allan Poe's pet budgie Paco, which is proven in the episode \"Time Flies\". Poe is voiced by [[Adrian Truss]].\n\n===Scaredy Bat===\nScaredy Bat is a [[bat]] with an Indian accent who is afraid of almost everything. Where Ruby finds happiness and Iris finds adventure, Scaredy finds only fear. Despite being a bat, he's afraid of flying and is also afraid of the dark. He's also afraid of his own reflection. However, he has overcome those fears after several episodes. This constant state of fear is perfect for Boo Boo, the mansion's ghost, since Scaredy is the only one who is afraid of him. The only thing he's not afraid of is a [[crumpet]]. Even if his fear sometimes gets the better of him, Scaredy is the loyal and talented drummer of Frank and Len's band, R.I.P. When he is behind the kit, Scaredy is a beat machine and forgets his fear. He also enjoys eating [[mosquito]]es. Voiced by [[Peter Keleghan]].\n\n===Boo Boo===\nThe mansion's [[ghost]], Boo Boo sees it as his job to haunt. However, it's a little difficult for him to do that when everyone thinks he's cute, and he hates being thought of as cute. In the episode \"Doom with a View\", (Boo Boo's first appearance in the series), he takes exception to the other characters referring to his cuteness when they first see him.  When he first arrived at the mansion, Boo Boo wasn't an official ghost in that he couldn't pass through walls and only Doom Kitty, Ruby's cat, could see him. According to the leaders of the Ghost Family (two large, mobster-type ghosts who go by the names of Mr. White and Mr. White), Boo Boo couldn't become a full ghost until he had scared at least one person and Ruby's mansion was the house they'd selected for him. But since Boo Boo couldn't go through walls and Doom Kitty was the only one in the house who could see him, his job was very difficult. However, when Doom Kitty splashed milk on him to reveal his presence, Boo Boo got a slight scare out of Misery when he almost splashed milk onto a tablecloth once owned by her \"great-great-really-great-grandmother.\" However, it was enough of a scare for Boo Boo to become a full-fledged ghost, since he can now pass through walls and everyone can see him. After that though, his only real motivation for staying in the mansion has been to scare Scaredy Bat, as he hasn't been able to scare anyone else since, besides people from outside of Gloomsville. However, Boo Boo enjoys pranking more than he enjoys scaring, much to Mr. White's disappointment. Despite this, he and Scaredy Bat seem to be good friends (perhaps ''best friends''). Doom Kitty hates Boo Boo, especially since she was framed in \"Doom with a View\", and his presence always gets her into trouble. Voiced by [[Barbara Mamabolo]].\n\n===Mr. Buns===\nMr. Buns is a stuffed rabbit that Ruby created from one of her leftover socks. The floppy, yet enigmatic Mr. Buns loves tea cozies and pretty much finds himself in the middle of almost all the action in the mansion. He also has a strange tendency to show up anywhere and do random tasks. When Misery first sees him, she calls him a stuffed sock. Later, she is convinced that he is a \"special one of a kind friend\".{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Minor characters==\n\n===Mr. White and Mr. White===\nThese two large ghosts are the mentors and teachers of young Boo Boo in his learning to be a ghost. Distinguished by their glasses and high rank within \"The Family\", they typically act in a mafia orientated manner (even having their own pasta making skit and Italian music playing in the background), often threatening to take Boo Boo away if he does not complete enough scares or if he is pulling pranks, such as the line \"Less Taunt. More Haunt.\" Noticeably, the Mr. White with the hat is a higher rank than the other Mr. White, who is usually driving their mode of transport. The characters are voiced by [[Harvey Atkin]] and [[Ron Rubin (voice actor)|Ron Rubin]].\n\n===Squig===\nA large flying worm that Iris made friends with in her travels. Although he is not often seen, he accompanies Iris on all her adventures as both her companion and sometimes her mode of transport. He is about five times as big as Iris, and is black and red with patterns down his back, and has a small set of wings at the end of his tail. According to Iris, he can fly because nobody ever told him he can't.\n\n===Venus===\nAnother of Iris's many pets, Venus is a [[venus flytrap]]. When Venus first appeared, she was very voracious and typically acted as a pet. However, after she ate the heart that Skull Boy made in the episode \"Science Fair or Foul\", she became much more caring and knowledgeable, eventually becoming a successful writer and being able to speak very eloquently, as seen in the skit \"Suspense Writing with...?\". Venus speaks with a thick French accent, because the record Iris used to teach her was dictated by a French man. However, Skull Boy's French accent is stronger, leading her to confusion.\n\n===Mr. Mummbles===\nRuby's next door neighbour, Mr. Mummbles<ref>Ruby Gloom Skit: \"The Mr. Mummbles How-to Show\"</ref> lives in a glass house with his pet, a frog named Socrates. Mr. Mummbles received his name from Poe in the episode \"Poe-Ranoia\", where Poe thought that he was a murderer, and since then the name has stuck. After a revelation that Mr. Mummbles designs and creates amusement park rides, he can be seen in later episodes testing these new rides. His rides are designed to make people happy, sometimes having features that tickle the passengers. Mr. Mummbles also follows the rule \"Safety First\", however his rides seem to bend in the opposite direction to being safe, which includes massive spirals, gaps and fire on the tracks. Mr. Mummbles is voiced by [[Derek McGrath]].\n\n===The Skele-Tunes===\nA group of Jazz/scat/Cajun musicians that befriend Skull Boy (referring to him as \"SB\"). The band contains four skeletons. The vocalist is the jazzy Skele-T, instantly recognized by his outfit, earrings and gold tooth. The other skeletons each have a different instrument, one with an accordion, one with a tuba and one using his rib cage as a xylophone. They are shown to be \"Jokers\", disappearing and joking around with Skull Boy. Skele-T does most of the talking, using jazz slang and phrases, such as \"You're straight from the fridge daddio\" and throwing in skeleton puns like \"You fracture me\" instead of \"You crack me up\". When Skull Boy leaves to try to find his roots, Skele-T even invites him to join their band, but he refuses due to a case of homesickness. Skele-T is voiced by Michael Dunston.\n\n===Misery's cousins and ancestors===\nIn the episode \"I'll Be Home For Misery\" introduces Misery's other relatives throughout the ages for their \"once in a millennium\" family reunion.\n\n'''Malady and Malaise'''\nThese two sisters are Misery's cousins, who, when both are together, cause a localized ice age. Malady is the one character that is more disease-prone than her cousin, Misery. She apparently suffers from every known disease, ailment, illness, symptom and allergy almost simultaneously, and when asked about them, she runs through all the events and procedures that led to one injury, which usually lasts hours until the conclusion. Malaise suffers from [[narcolepsy]] and can often be seen lying on a couch or bed or even asleep on the floor randomly. She is accompanied by many creatures including a snake, spiders, an octopus, snails and butterflies, which usually attach themselves to the full-body veil she wears. Despite their faults, Misery loves her cousins.\n\n'''Mayhem''' \u2013 A cavegirl that resembles Misery. It is shown that she possesses great physical strength and little intelligence. It is implied that she chased away the dinosaurs, and is very sad that they're gone. She chases Scaredy Bat throughout the episode \"I'll Be Home For Misery\", shouting \"Here Birdy, Birdy, Birdy\". She is also seen in the episode, \"Time Flies\".\n\n'''Mildew''' \u2013 A Japanese [[geisha]] that resembles Misery. She speaks in respectful tones but clashes the most with Mayhem and Migraine. Unlike her relatives, Mildew has normal colored eyes and skin. She also seems to constantly clarify whenever she is joking or not, as she once said: \"Misery, I've heard so much about you. All bad. Joke.\"\n\n'''Migraine''' \u2013 Arriving on the ''[[Titanic]]'', Migraine usually has her arms back yelling \"I'm the queen of the world\". She also talks like a [[valley girl]] and has a Hawaiian flower in her hair. She is also seen in the episodes \"Time Flies\" and \"Disaster Becomes You\".\n\n'''Morose''' \u2013 Truly [[goth subculture|goth]], Morose has dyed green/black hair and green and black striped stockings. Very thick streaks of eyeshadow run down her face because it mixes with her tears. She is also a singer who unlike Misery, can sing while awake and performs a song with Frank & Len while playing keyboards. The boys love it until their house falls in around her. One of Morose's only happy moments in Gloomsville is when she said \"cool... another verse?\". Misery calls her \"Aunt Morose\" in the episode \"Sunny Daze\".\n\n'''Mopey''' \u2013 The [[optimistic]] member of Misery's family, she has hair just like Ruby's, which Ruby compliments and Mopey says \"Right back atcha!\".\n\n'''Motley''' \u2013 Misery's great great ''really'' great grandmother. Burnt in the [[Great Fire of London]], Motley has almost no hair left and seems generally singed all over with the bit of remaining hair on fire. Unlike Misery, she prefers light in the darkness. A piece of her table cloth was the only thing salvaged from the fire, and became Misery's prized possession.\n\n'''Myopic, Malice and Misbegotten''' \u2013 The triplets are little kids that seem pretty happy for members of the misery family. They dance and laugh around Morose leading Morose to wail \"Children, Cheerful, Playful Children... Why?! Why?!\"\n\nIn addition to these named family members, four others are shown. A relative that resembles Misery in a French Peasant Maid's outfit, who plays drums while Morose sings and plays her keyboard, another relative in a Medieval Princess gown and pointy hat (who appeared in the episode \"Disaster Becomes You\"), one dressed as a 1970s soul sister with a white streak of hair like Frankenstein's bride, and one with white hair in braided pigtails curved up like bullhorns with a spider web in the middle.\n\nThe end of the episode suggests that the entire reunion was a dream, so the question remains how many of them are actually Misery cousins (such as Malady, Malaise, Mayhem, etc.) and how many are from Misery's imagination as they just look like Misery in different getups from other episodes (Motley, Mopey, the 1970s Soul Sister, etc.).\n\n===Bunny===\nA pink bunny with red eyes, he pretends to be a cute and loving bunny with a cold, but is actually evil. He wanted to steal everything from Ruby's mansion. Doom Kitty was the only one who knew he was evil. Later everyone else finds out this bunny is evil when Doom Kitty traps him in a cage and everyone saw their stuff in his carriage, so they kicked him out.\n\n===Gunther and Uta===\nTwo twins with a [[German accent]] who came to live in the Gloom household, after their run-in with a [[witch]] and her [[gingerbread house]]. They thought Ruby and her friends were about to get rid of them despite knowing that what Ruby and her friends do delights everyone else.\n\n==Episodes==\nThese are the episodes that have aired on television. Most of the episodes contain a short skit at the beginning and end of the episodes, \"Gloomer Rumor\", the first episode of the series, is the only episode to have no opening skit, but an ending skit.\n\n===Season 1 (2006\u201307)===\n{{Episode table\n|background=000\n|overall=\n|season=\n|title=\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n|

There isn't a single thing in the world that gets her down or a single negative that she can't turn into a positive. Her positive attitude allows her to act as the voice of reason in the mansion when her friends lose focus on real issues. Ruby has a crush on one of her friends, Skull Boy, and nearly reveals her feelings to him in the episode \"Sunny Daze\", when the two of them are trapped in a cave. Her positive outlook also makes Ruby very loyal to her friends. She likes to write in her diary and knit. Voiced by [[Sarah Gadon]].\n\n===Doom Kitty===\nAs Ruby's pet cat, Doom Kitty has a complete free run of the mansion and is therefore usually the only one with total knowledge of what is going on in any given area of the house. This keeps her one step ahead of Ruby and the others most of the time, because whenever something strange happens in the mansion, Doom Kitty will usually have all the facts already while everyone else is still trying to figure things out. Unfortunately, since Doom Kitty can't talk, her only hope of communicating with the others is through mime with [[violin]] noises. Ruby usually has an easy time understanding her, but it doesn't always work. This shows that Doom Kitty hates it when she is trying to communicate, and her friends think that she is playing charades. She sometimes tries to warn Scaredy Bat about Boo Boo's pranks.\n\n===Iris===\nLike Ruby, Iris goes through life without a care in the world, but in a much different way. Where Ruby finds happiness in anything, Iris finds adventure. From safaris to fighting wild animals to even shooting herself out of a cannon, there isn't a single thing this [[cyclops]] girl won't try at least once, as long as she thinks it's fun. Unfortunately, Iris's adventuresome nature also makes her quite impulsive and she has a bad habit of jumping into a situation without considering potential consequences. This usually results in trouble she doesn't expect. However, as soon as the trouble is gone, she's off again on another adventure. Voiced by [[Stacey DePass]].\n\n===Misery===\nMisery doesn't mean to be a walking disaster area. Her mishaps are usually a combination of clumsiness and extraordinary bad luck. Evidently, these traits run in her family, as Misery has had relatives who have been present at every single major disaster in recorded history. Fortunately, her friends are all kindhearted enough to take this in their stride. Misery spends most of the time in a state of detached apathy and with ever-present trails of tears running from her eyes. She does have tiny moments of happiness throughout the series, but alas they're few and far between, her bad luck rears its ugly head and strikes her down with a vengeance, usually in the form of lightning bolts. She is pretty much beloved by many fans due to her comic relief and cute appearance. Misery is voiced by [[Emily Hampshire]].\n\n===Skull Boy===\nA man of many talents, Skull Boy is the mansion's official Jack of All Trades. From film directing to private investigating, Skull Boy can pretty much do it all. His only problem is that he can't seem to find one thing and stick to it for any serious length of time. But if Skull Boy doesn't know where he's going, it's mostly because he doesn't know where he comes from. This is referred to in many episodes when each time he finds a new skill he surmises his must come from a long line of others with that same skill, indicating he knows little to nothing about his origins. There have been several moments that confirm that Ruby has a crush on him, such as in the episode \"Quadro-Gloomia\" when Frank and Len get inside Ruby's head and experience her feelings for Skull Boy first hand. He does share the same feelings towards Ruby, but he is clueless about her feelings.  Even though Skull Boy doesn't know where he is from, he has a family \u2013 his friends are his family. Voiced by [[Scott McCord]].\n\nIn Skull Boy's endeavor to discover his roots, he has undergone many personae and occupations. These include:\n{{div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* Action Hero\n* Animator\n* Architect\n* Army General\n* Astronomer\n* British Drummer\n* British General\n* Chef\n* Detective (Skull Spade)\n* Documentary Filmmaker\n* Etiquette Expert\n* Explorer\n* Film Director (seen in the bloopers of \"Doom With A View\" and behind the scenes of \"Seeing Eye To Eyes\")\n* French Investigator\n* Head Shrink\n* Ice Sculpture\n* Inventor\n* Jazz Musician\n* Layabout\n* Magician\n* Malt Shop Entrepreneur\n* Mechanic\n* Painter\n* Pilot\n* Psychologist\n* Ringmaster\n* R.I.P's band manager\n* Scientist\n* Shakespearean Actor\n* Sculptor\n* Tailor\n* Train Conductor\n* Train Engineer\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Frank and Len===\nRockers by nature, these conjoined brothers live in the mansion's garage. They have their own garage band, known as R.I.P (pronounced \"RIP\"). Frank and Len's strength lies in performing music. Unfortunately, this seems to be all that is their strength, since they both tend to lose focus on anything that isn't their music. They can hardly focus on something if it doesn't have a beat. Frank is actually the more intelligent of the two, often getting annoyed at Len's lack of understanding. Len is the more sentimental one, who seems to have a thing for small animals and things that don't exactly matter to anyone else. Even though they seem upbeat for their music, the two of them are almost never on the same page, even though they're conjoined. Despite this fact, Frank and Len are close. For example, in the episode \"Quadrogloomia\", when the brothers needed a way to become unconscious, they were unable to hit each other over the head with planks. Another example of this is in the episode \"Iris Springs Eternal\" where Ruby, Frank, and Len were sliding down a mud slide when Frank states, \"Len, if we don't get out of this I just want you to know that you've been the best brother a brother could have for a brother.\" Len replies with \"same here.\" Also, as of the episode \"Quadrogloomia\", Frank and Len are the only housemates (other than Doom Kitty) who know about Ruby's crush on Skull Boy. Voiced by [[David Berni]] (as Frank) and Jeremy Harris (as Len).\n\n===Edgar, Allan, and Poe===\nPoe the crow, along with his brothers Edgar and Allan, live in an attached addition to the mansion. However, out of the three, Poe is the one seen most often. Edgar and Allan are rarely seen and when they are, they never speak but act as Poe's bodyguards and servants since they are taller than him. Poe meanwhile, as a man of culture and sophistication, likes to think of himself as a role model to the rest of the mansion's residents. Unfortunately, he tends to be a little too attached to his image and likes to cover up the parts of him that make him look like less than what he makes himself out to be. For example, he'd rather tell people he's performing in an actual opera than admit that he's staying home to listen to opera records. Poe's pampered nature also tends to make him overreact to things that everyone else would more or less take in stride. There is at least some evidence that Poe's cultured accent is an affectation. In episode \"Unsung Hero\", Poe reverts to an East End accent while speaking to Skull Boy. Skull Boy remarks that Poe's Oxford accent has vanished much to Poe's discomfort. Poe is fond of claiming to be a descendant of Edgar Allan Poe's pet budgie Paco, which is proven in the episode \"Time Flies\". Poe is voiced by [[Adrian Truss]].\n\n===Scaredy Bat===\nScaredy Bat is a [[bat]] with an Indian accent who is afraid of almost everything. Where Ruby finds happiness and Iris finds adventure, Scaredy finds only fear. Despite being a bat, he's afraid of flying and is also afraid of the dark. He's also afraid of his own reflection. However, he has overcome those fears after several episodes. This constant state of fear is perfect for Boo Boo, the mansion's ghost, since Scaredy is the only one who is afraid of him. The only thing he's not afraid of is a [[crumpet]]. Even if his fear sometimes gets the better of him, Scaredy is the loyal and talented drummer of Frank and Len's band, R.I.P. When he is behind the kit, Scaredy is a beat machine and forgets his fear. He also enjoys eating [[mosquito]]es. Voiced by [[Peter Keleghan]].\n\n===Boo Boo===\nThe mansion's [[ghost]], Boo Boo sees it as his job to haunt. However, it's a little difficult for him to do that when everyone thinks he's cute, and he hates being thought of as cute. In the episode \"Doom with a View\", (Boo Boo's first appearance in the series), he takes exception to the other characters referring to his cuteness when they first see him.  When he first arrived at the mansion, Boo Boo wasn't an official ghost in that he couldn't pass through walls and only Doom Kitty, Ruby's cat, could see him. According to the leaders of the Ghost Family (two large, mobster-type ghosts who go by the names of Mr. White and Mr. White), Boo Boo couldn't become a full ghost until he had scared at least one person and Ruby's mansion was the house they'd selected for him. But since Boo Boo couldn't go through walls and Doom Kitty was the only one in the house who could see him, his job was very difficult. However, when Doom Kitty splashed milk on him to reveal his presence, Boo Boo got a slight scare out of Misery when he almost splashed milk onto a tablecloth once owned by her \"great-great-really-great-grandmother.\" However, it was enough of a scare for Boo Boo to become a full-fledged ghost, since he can now pass through walls and everyone can see him. After that though, his only real motivation for staying in the mansion has been to scare Scaredy Bat, as he hasn't been able to scare anyone else since, besides people from outside of Gloomsville. However, Boo Boo enjoys pranking more than he enjoys scaring, much to Mr. White's disappointment. Despite this, he and Scaredy Bat seem to be good friends (perhaps ''best friends''). Doom Kitty hates Boo Boo, especially since she was framed in \"Doom with a View\", and his presence always gets her into trouble. Voiced by [[Barbara Mamabolo]].\n\n===Mr. Buns===\nMr. Buns is a stuffed rabbit that Ruby created from one of her leftover socks. The floppy, yet enigmatic Mr. Buns loves tea cozies and pretty much finds himself in the middle of almost all the action in the mansion. He also has a strange tendency to show up anywhere and do random tasks. When Misery first sees him, she calls him a stuffed sock. Later, she is convinced that he is a \"special one of a kind friend\".{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Minor characters==\n\n===Mr. White and Mr. White===\nThese two large ghosts are the mentors and teachers of young Boo Boo in his learning to be a ghost. Distinguished by their glasses and high rank within \"The Family\", they typically act in a mafia orientated manner (even having their own pasta making skit and Italian music playing in the background), often threatening to take Boo Boo away if he does not complete enough scares or if he is pulling pranks, such as the line \"Less Taunt. More Haunt.\" Noticeably, the Mr. White with the hat is a higher rank than the other Mr. White, who is usually driving their mode of transport. The characters are voiced by [[Harvey Atkin]] and [[Ron Rubin (voice actor)|Ron Rubin]].\n\n===Squig===\nA large flying worm that Iris made friends with in her travels. Although he is not often seen, he accompanies Iris on all her adventures as both her companion and sometimes her mode of transport. He is about five times as big as Iris, and is black and red with patterns down his back, and has a small set of wings at the end of his tail. According to Iris, he can fly because nobody ever told him he can't.\n\n===Venus===\nAnother of Iris's many pets, Venus is a [[venus flytrap]]. When Venus first appeared, she was very voracious and typically acted as a pet. However, after she ate the heart that Skull Boy made in the episode \"Science Fair or Foul\", she became much more caring and knowledgeable, eventually becoming a successful writer and being able to speak very eloquently, as seen in the skit \"Suspense Writing with...?\". Venus speaks with a thick French accent, because the record Iris used to teach her was dictated by a French man. However, Skull Boy's French accent is stronger, leading her to confusion.\n\n===Mr. Mummbles===\nRuby's next door neighbour, Mr. Mummbles<ref>Ruby Gloom Skit: \"The Mr. Mummbles How-to Show\"</ref> lives in a glass house with his pet, a frog named Socrates. Mr. Mummbles received his name from Poe in the episode \"Poe-Ranoia\", where Poe thought that he was a murderer, and since then the name has stuck. After a revelation that Mr. Mummbles designs and creates amusement park rides, he can be seen in later episodes testing these new rides. His rides are designed to make people happy, sometimes having features that tickle the passengers. Mr. Mummbles also follows the rule \"Safety First\", however his rides seem to bend in the opposite direction to being safe, which includes massive spirals, gaps and fire on the tracks. Mr. Mummbles is voiced by [[Derek McGrath]].\n\n===The Skele-Tunes===\nA group of Jazz/scat/Cajun musicians that befriend Skull Boy (referring to him as \"SB\"). The band contains four skeletons. The vocalist is the jazzy Skele-T, instantly recognized by his outfit, earrings and gold tooth. The other skeletons each have a different instrument, one with an accordion, one with a tuba and one using his rib cage as a xylophone. They are shown to be \"Jokers\", disappearing and joking around with Skull Boy. Skele-T does most of the talking, using jazz slang and phrases, such as \"You're straight from the fridge daddio\" and throwing in skeleton puns like \"You fracture me\" instead of \"You crack me up\". When Skull Boy leaves to try to find his roots, Skele-T even invites him to join their band, but he refuses due to a case of homesickness. Skele-T is voiced by Michael Dunston.\n\n===Misery's cousins and ancestors===\nIn the episode \"I'll Be Home For Misery\" introduces Misery's other relatives throughout the ages for their \"once in a millennium\" family reunion.\n\n'''Malady and Malaise'''\nThese two sisters are Misery's cousins, who, when both are together, cause a localized ice age. Malady is the one character that is more disease-prone than her cousin, Misery. She apparently suffers from every known disease, ailment, illness, symptom and allergy almost simultaneously, and when asked about them, she runs through all the events and procedures that led to one injury, which usually lasts hours until the conclusion. Malaise suffers from [[narcolepsy]] and can often be seen lying on a couch or bed or even asleep on the floor randomly. She is accompanied by many creatures including a snake, spiders, an octopus, snails and butterflies, which usually attach themselves to the full-body veil she wears. Despite their faults, Misery loves her cousins.\n\n'''Mayhem''' \u2013 A cavegirl that resembles Misery. It is shown that she possesses great physical strength and little intelligence. It is implied that she chased away the dinosaurs, and is very sad that they're gone. She chases Scaredy Bat throughout the episode \"I'll Be Home For Misery\", shouting \"Here Birdy, Birdy, Birdy\". She is also seen in the episode, \"Time Flies\".\n\n'''Mildew''' \u2013 A Japanese [[geisha]] that resembles Misery. She speaks in respectful tones but clashes the most with Mayhem and Migraine. Unlike her relatives, Mildew has normal colored eyes and skin. She also seems to constantly clarify whenever she is joking or not, as she once said: \"Misery, I've heard so much about you. All bad. Joke.\"\n\n'''Migraine''' \u2013 Arriving on the ''[[Titanic]]'', Migraine usually has her arms back yelling \"I'm the queen of the world\". She also talks like a [[valley girl]] and has a Hawaiian flower in her hair. She is also seen in the episodes \"Time Flies\" and \"Disaster Becomes You\".\n\n'''Morose''' \u2013 Truly [[goth subculture|goth]], Morose has dyed green/black hair and green and black striped stockings. Very thick streaks of eyeshadow run down her face because it mixes with her tears. She is also a singer who unlike Misery, can sing while awake and performs a song with Frank & Len while playing keyboards. The boys love it until their house falls in around her. One of Morose's only happy moments in Gloomsville is when she said \"cool... another verse?\". Misery calls her \"Aunt Morose\" in the episode \"Sunny Daze\".\n\n'''Mopey''' \u2013 The [[optimistic]] member of Misery's family, she has hair just like Ruby's, which Ruby compliments and Mopey says \"Right back atcha!\".\n\n'''Motley''' \u2013 Misery's great great ''really'' great grandmother. Burnt in the [[Great Fire of London]], Motley has almost no hair left and seems generally singed all over with the bit of remaining hair on fire. Unlike Misery, she prefers light in the darkness. A piece of her table cloth was the only thing salvaged from the fire, and became Misery's prized possession.\n\n'''Myopic, Malice and Misbegotten''' \u2013 The triplets are little kids that seem pretty happy for members of the misery family. They dance and laugh around Morose leading Morose to wail \"Children, Cheerful, Playful Children... Why?! Why?!\"\n\nIn addition to these named family members, four others are shown. A relative that resembles Misery in a French Peasant Maid's outfit, who plays drums while Morose sings and plays her keyboard, another relative in a Medieval Princess gown and pointy hat (who appeared in the episode \"Disaster Becomes You\"), one dressed as a 1970s soul sister with a white streak of hair like Frankenstein's bride, and one with white hair in braided pigtails curved up like bullhorns with a spider web in the middle.\n\nThe end of the episode suggests that the entire reunion was a dream, so the question remains how many of them are actually Misery cousins (such as Malady, Malaise, Mayhem, etc.) and how many are from Misery's imagination as they just look like Misery in different getups from other episodes (Motley, Mopey, the 1970s Soul Sister, etc.).\n\n===Bunny===\nA pink bunny with red eyes, he pretends to be a cute and loving bunny with a cold, but is actually evil. He wanted to steal everything from Ruby's mansion. Doom Kitty was the only one who knew he was evil. Later everyone else finds out this bunny is evil when Doom Kitty traps him in a cage and everyone saw their stuff in his carriage, so they kicked him out.\n\n===Gunther and Uta===\nTwo twins with a [[German accent]] who came to live in the Gloom household, after their run-in with a [[witch]] and her [[gingerbread house]]. They thought Ruby and her friends were about to get rid of them despite knowing that what Ruby and her friends do delights everyone else.\n\n==Episodes==\nThese are the episodes that have aired on television. Most of the episodes contain a short skit at the beginning and end of the episodes, \"Gloomer Rumor\", the first episode of the series, is the only episode to have no opening skit, but an ending skit.\n\n===Season 1 (2006\u201307)===\n{{Episode table\n|background=000\n|overall=\n|season=\n|title=\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n|
