Beck proposed that Child work with them to make the book appeal to Americans. In 1951, Child, Beck, and Bertholle began to teach cooking to American women in Child's Paris kitchen, calling their informal school ''[[\u00c9cole des trois gourmandes|L'\u00e9cole des trois gourmandes]]'' (The School of the Three Food Lovers). For the next decade, as the Childs moved around Europe and finally to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], the three researched and repeatedly tested recipes. Child translated the [[French language|French]] into [[English language|English]], making the recipes detailed, interesting, and practical.\n\nIn 1963, the Childs built a home near the [[Provence]] town of [[Plascassier]] in the hills above [[Cannes]] on property belonging to co-author [[Simone Beck]] and her husband, Jean Fischbacher. The Childs named it \"[[La Pitchoune|La&nbsp;Pitchoune]]\", a [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]] word meaning \"the little one\" but over time the property was often affectionately referred to simply as \"La Peetch\".<ref name=\"MLIF\">{{cite book|last=Child|first=Julia|author2=Prud'homme, Alex|title=My Life in France|publisher=Random House|year=2006|pages=268\u2013272|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8cKLQO4bgDQC&pg=PA85|isbn=978-0-307-27769-5}}</ref>\n\n===Media career===\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage= [[File:Julia Child at KUHT.jpg|210px]] | video1=[http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/V_D064C8C45DA84E9FB41E959380C487C6 French Chef; Lasagne a la Francaise], 11/25/1970, 28:37, [[WGBH Educational Foundation|WGBH Open Vault]]<ref name=\"WGBHOV\">{{cite web |title=French Chef; Lasagne a la Francaise |work=The Julia Child Project | publisher =[[WGBH Educational Foundation]] |date=November 25, 1970 |url=http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/V_D064C8C45DA84E9FB41E959380C487C6 |accessdate=September 15, 2016}}</ref>\n | audio1= [https://www.npr.org/2011/09/01/139793130/julia-child-on-france-fat-and-food-on-the-floor Julia Child On France, Fat And Food On The Floor], 11/14/1989, 10:13, [[Fresh Air]] with [[Terry Gross]]<ref name=\"Fresh Air\"/>\n}}\n\nThe three would-be authors initially signed a contract with publisher [[Houghton Mifflin]], which later rejected the manuscript for seeming too much like an encyclopedia.

Lauded for its helpful illustrations and precise attention to detail, and for making fine cuisine accessible, the book is still in print and is considered a seminal culinary work. Following this success, Child wrote magazine articles and a regular column for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' newspaper. She would go on to publish nearly twenty titles under her name and with others. Many, though not all, were related to her television shows. Her last book was the autobiographical ''[[My Life in France]]'', published posthumously in 2006 and written with her grandnephew, [[Alex Prud'homme]]. The book recounts Child's life with her husband, [[Paul Cushing Child]], in [[post-World War II]] France.\n\n===''The French Chef'' and related books===\n{{main|The French Chef}}\nA 1962 appearance on a book review show on what was then the [[National Educational Television]] (NET) station of Boston, [[WGBH-TV]] (now a major [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] station), led to the inception of her first television cooking show after viewers enjoyed her demonstration of how to cook an omelette. ''[[The French Chef]]'' had its debut on February 11, 1963, on [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] and was immediately successful. The show ran nationally for ten years and won [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] and [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] Awards, including the first Emmy award for an educational program. Though she was not the first television cook, Child was the most widely seen. She attracted the broadest audience with her cheery enthusiasm, distinctively warbly voice, and unpatronizing, unaffected manner. In 1972, ''The French Chef'' became the first television program to be [[close captioning#Terminology|captioned]] for the [[deaf]], even though this was done using the preliminary technology of open-captioning.\n\nChild's second book, ''The French Chef Cookbook,'' was a collection of the recipes she had demonstrated on the show. It was soon followed in 1971 by ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume Two,'' again in collaboration with Simone Beck, but not with Louisette Bertholle, with whom the professional relationship had ended. Child's fourth book, ''From Julia Child's Kitchen,'' was illustrated with her husband's photographs and documented the color series of ''The French Chef,'' as well as provided an extensive library of kitchen notes compiled by Child during the course of the show.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Julia Child's kitchen|last=Julia|first=Child|others=Child, Paul, 1902-1994,, Walton, Albie|isbn=9780140463712|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|oclc=877067411}}</ref>\n\n=== Impact on American households ===\nJulia Child had a large impact on American households and housewives. Because of the technology in the 1960s, the show was unedited, causing her blunders to appear in the final version and ultimately lend \"authenticity and approachability to television.\" <ref>Toby Miller. \"Screening Food: French Cuisine and the Television Palate.\" In French Food: On the Table, On the Page, and in French Culture. P. 224</ref> According to Toby Miller in \"Screening Food: French Cuisine and the Television Palate,\" one mother he spoke to said that sometimes \"all that stood between me and insanity was hearty Julia Child\" because of Child's ability to soothe and transport her. In addition, Miller notes that Child's show began before the feminist movement of the 1960s, which meant that the issues housewives and women faced were somewhat ignored on television.<ref>Toby Miller. \"Screening Food: French Cuisine and the Television Palate.\" In French Food: On the Table, On the Page, and in French Culture.

In 1989, she published what she considered her magnum opus, a book and instructional video series collectively entitled ''[[The Way To Cook]]''.\n\nIn the mid 90s, as part of her work with the American Institute of Wine and Food, Julia Child became increasingly concerned about children's food education. This resulted in the initiative known as [https://www.aiwf.org/site_page.cfm?pk_association_webpage_menu=2040&pk_association_webpage=5508 Days of Taste].\n\nChild starred in four more series in the 1990s that featured guest chefs: ''Cooking with Master Chefs'', ''In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs'', ''[[Baking with Julia]]'', and ''Julia Child & Jacques P\u00e9pin Cooking at Home''. She collaborated with [[Jacques P\u00e9pin]] many times for television programs and cookbooks. All of Child's books during this time stemmed from the television series of the same names.\n\nChild's use of ingredients like butter and cream has been questioned by food critics and modern-day nutritionists. She addressed these criticisms throughout her career, predicting that a \"fanatical fear of food\" would take over the country's dining habits, and that focusing too much on nutrition takes the pleasure from enjoying food.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/11/garden/savoring-the-world-according-to-julia.html|work=New York Times|title=Savoring the World According to Julia|first=Molly|last=O'Neill|date=October 11, 1989}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/business/24julia.html|work=New York Times|title=After 48 Years, Julia Child Has a Big Best Seller, Butter and All|first=Stephanie|last=Clifford|date=August 23, 2009}}</ref> In a 1990 interview, Child said, \"Everybody is overreacting.

It is now on display at the [[National Museum of American History]] in Washington, D.C. Beginning with ''In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs,'' the Childs' home kitchen in Cambridge was fully transformed into a functional set, with TV-quality lighting, three cameras positioned to catch all angles in the room, and a massive center island with a gas stovetop on one side and an electric stovetop on the other, but leaving the rest of the Childs' appliances alone, including \"my wall oven with its squeaking door.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs|last=Child|first=Julia|year=1995|publisher=Knopf|isbn=0-679-43896-3|chapter=Acknowledgments}}</ref> This kitchen backdrop hosted nearly all of Child's 1990s television series.\n\n==Last years and death==\n[[File:Julia Child 1994.jpg|thumb|left|Child in 1994]]\nAfter the death of her beloved friend [[Simone Beck]], Child relinquished [[La Pitchoune]] after a month long stay in June 1992 with her family, her niece, Phila, and close friend and biographer [[No\u00ebl Riley Fitch]]. She turned the keys over to Jean Fischbacher's sister, just as she and Paul had promised nearly 30 years earlier. Also in 1992, Julia spent five days in Sicily at the invitation of Regaleali Winery.

For the next decade, as the Childs moved around Europe and finally to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], the three researched and repeatedly tested recipes. Child translated the [[French language|French]] into [[English language|English]], making the recipes detailed, interesting, and practical.\n\nIn 1963, the Childs built a home near the [[Provence]] town of [[Plascassier]] in the hills above [[Cannes]] on property belonging to co-author [[Simone Beck]] and her husband, Jean Fischbacher.

Lauded for its helpful illustrations and precise attention to detail, and for making fine cuisine accessible, the book is still in print and is considered a seminal culinary work. Following this success, Child wrote magazine articles and a regular column for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' newspaper. She would go on to publish nearly twenty titles under her name and with others. Many, though not all, were related to her television shows. Her last book was the autobiographical ''[[My Life in France]]'', published posthumously in 2006 and written with her grandnephew, [[Alex Prud'homme]]. The book recounts Child's life with her husband, [[Paul Cushing Child]], in [[post-World War II]] France.\n\n===''The French Chef'' and related books===\n{{main|The French Chef}}\nA 1962 appearance on a book review show on what was then the [[National Educational Television]] (NET) station of Boston, [[WGBH-TV]] (now a major [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] station), led to the inception of her first television cooking show after viewers enjoyed her demonstration of how to cook an omelette. ''[[The French Chef]]'' had its debut on February 11, 1963, on [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] and was immediately successful. The show ran nationally for ten years and won [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] and [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] Awards, including the first Emmy award for an educational program. Though she was not the first television cook, Child was the most widely seen. She attracted the broadest audience with her cheery enthusiasm, distinctively warbly voice, and unpatronizing, unaffected manner. In 1972, ''The French Chef'' became the first television program to be [[close captioning#Terminology|captioned]] for the [[deaf]], even though this was done using the preliminary technology of open-captioning.\n\nChild's second book, ''The French Chef Cookbook,'' was a collection of the recipes she had demonstrated on the show. It was soon followed in 1971 by ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume Two,'' again in collaboration with Simone Beck, but not with Louisette Bertholle, with whom the professional relationship had ended. Child's fourth book, ''From Julia Child's Kitchen,'' was illustrated with her husband's photographs and documented the color series of ''The French Chef,'' as well as provided an extensive library of kitchen notes compiled by Child during the course of the show.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Julia Child's kitchen|last=Julia|first=Child|others=Child, Paul, 1902-1994,, Walton, Albie|isbn=9780140463712|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|oclc=877067411}}</ref>\n\n=== Impact on American households ===\nJulia Child had a large impact on American households and housewives. Because of the technology in the 1960s, the show was unedited, causing her blunders to appear in the final version and ultimately lend \"authenticity and approachability to television.\" <ref>Toby Miller. \"Screening Food: French Cuisine and the Television Palate.\" In French Food: On the Table, On the Page, and in French Culture. P. 224</ref> According to Toby Miller in \"Screening Food: French Cuisine and the Television Palate,\" one mother he spoke to said that sometimes \"all that stood between me and insanity was hearty Julia Child\" because of Child's ability to soothe and transport her. In addition, Miller notes that Child's show began before the feminist movement of the 1960s, which meant that the issues housewives and women faced were somewhat ignored on television.<ref>Toby Miller. \"Screening Food: French Cuisine and the Television Palate.\" In French Food: On the Table, On the Page, and in French Culture.

In 1989, she published what she considered her magnum opus, a book and instructional video series collectively entitled ''[[The Way To Cook]]''.\n\nIn the mid 90s, as part of her work with the American Institute of Wine and Food, Julia Child became increasingly concerned about children's food education. This resulted in the initiative known as [https://www.aiwf.org/site_page.cfm?pk_association_webpage_menu=2040&pk_association_webpage=5508 Days of Taste].\n\nChild starred in four more series in the 1990s that featured guest chefs: ''Cooking with Master Chefs'', ''In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs'', ''[[Baking with Julia]]'', and ''Julia Child & Jacques P\u00e9pin Cooking at Home''. She collaborated with [[Jacques P\u00e9pin]] many times for television programs and cookbooks. All of Child's books during this time stemmed from the television series of the same names.\n\nChild's use of ingredients like butter and cream has been questioned by food critics and modern-day nutritionists.

She turned the keys over to Jean Fischbacher's sister, just as she and Paul had promised nearly 30 years earlier. Also in 1992, Julia spent five days in Sicily at the invitation of Regaleali Winery. American journalist [[Bob Spitz]] spent a brief time with Julia during that period while he was researching and writing his then working title, ''History of Eating and Cooking in America''.

It is also known as '''automatic speech recognition''' ('''ASR'''), '''computer speech recognition''' or '''speech to text''' ('''STT'''). It incorporates knowledge and research in the [[computer science]], [[linguistics]] and [[computer engineering]] fields.\n\nSome speech recognition systems require \"training\" (also called \"enrollment\") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated [[vocabulary]] into the system.

Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used in many systems. Language modeling is also used in many other natural language processing applications such as [[document classification]] or [[statistical machine translation]].\n\n===Hidden Markov models===\n{{Main|Hidden Markov model}}\nModern general-purpose speech recognition systems are based on Hidden Markov Models. These are statistical models that output a sequence of symbols or quantities. HMMs are used in speech recognition because a speech signal can be viewed as a piecewise stationary signal or a short-time stationary signal. In a short time-scale (e.g., 10 milliseconds), speech can be approximated as a [[stationary process]]. Speech can be thought of as a [[Markov model]] for many stochastic purposes.\n\nAnother reason why HMMs are popular is because they can be trained automatically and are simple and computationally feasible to use. In speech recognition, the hidden Markov model would output a sequence of ''n''-dimensional real-valued vectors (with ''n'' being a small integer, such as 10), outputting one of these every 10 milliseconds. The vectors would consist of [[cepstrum|cepstral]] coefficients, which are obtained by taking a [[Fourier transform]] of a short time window of speech and decorrelating the spectrum using a [[cosine transform]], then taking the first (most significant) coefficients. The hidden Markov model will tend to have in each state a statistical distribution that is a mixture of diagonal covariance Gaussians, which will give a likelihood for each observed vector. Each word, or (for more general speech recognition systems), each [[phoneme]], will have a different output distribution; a hidden Markov model for a sequence of words or phonemes is made by concatenating the individual trained hidden Markov models for the separate words and phonemes.\n\nDescribed above are the core elements of the most common, HMM-based approach to speech recognition. Modern speech recognition systems use various combinations of a number of standard techniques in order to improve results over the basic approach described above. A typical large-vocabulary system would need [[context dependency]] for the phonemes (so phonemes with different left and right context have different realizations as HMM states); it would use [[cepstral normalization]] to normalize for different speaker and recording conditions; for further speaker normalization it might use vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) for male-female normalization and [[maximum likelihood linear regression]] (MLLR) for more general speaker adaptation. The features would have so-called [[delta coefficient|delta]] and [[delta-delta coefficient]]s to capture speech dynamics and in addition might use [[heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis]] (HLDA); or might skip the delta and delta-delta coefficients and use [[splicing (speech recognition)|splicing]] and an [[Linear Discriminant Analysis|LDA]]-based projection followed perhaps by [[heteroscedastic]] linear discriminant analysis or a [[global semi-tied co variance]] transform (also known as [[maximum likelihood linear transform]], or MLLT). Many systems use so-called discriminative training techniques that dispense with a purely statistical approach to HMM parameter estimation and instead optimize some classification-related measure of the training data. Examples are maximum [[mutual information]] (MMI), minimum classification error (MCE) and minimum phone error (MPE).\n\nDecoding of the speech (the term for what happens when the system is presented with a new utterance and must compute the most likely source sentence) would probably use the [[Viterbi algorithm]] to find the best path, and here there is a choice between dynamically creating a combination hidden Markov model, which includes both the acoustic and language model information, and combining it statically beforehand (the [[finite state transducer]], or FST, approach).\n\nA possible improvement to decoding is to keep a set of good candidates instead of just keeping the best candidate, and to use a better scoring function ([[re scoring (ASR)|re scoring]]) to rate these good candidates so that we may pick the best one according to this refined score. The set of candidates can be kept either as a list (the [[N-best list]] approach) or as a subset of the models (a [[lattice (order)|lattice]]). Re scoring is usually done by trying to minimize the [[Bayes risk]]<ref>{{cite journal\n |last1       = Goel\n |first1      = Vaibhava\n |last2       = Byrne\n |first2      = William J.\n |year        = 2000\n |title       = Minimum Bayes-risk automatic speech recognition\n |url         = http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/people/vgoel/publications/CSAL.ps\n |journal     = Computer Speech & Language\n |volume      = 14\n |issue       = 2\n |pages       = 115\u2013135\n |doi         = 10.1006/csla.2000.0138\n |accessdate  = 28 March 2011\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725225846/http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/people/vgoel/publications/CSAL.ps\n |archivedate = 25 July 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> (or an approximation thereof): Instead of taking the source sentence with maximal probability, we try to take the sentence that minimizes the expectancy of a given loss function with regards to all possible transcriptions (i.e., we take the sentence that minimizes the average distance to other possible sentences weighted by their estimated probability). The loss function is usually the [[Levenshtein distance]], though it can be different distances for specific tasks; the set of possible transcriptions is, of course, pruned to maintain tractability. Efficient algorithms have been devised to re score [[lattice (order)|lattices]] represented as weighted [[finite state transducers]] with [[edit distance]]s represented themselves as a [[finite state transducer]] verifying certain assumptions.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last        = Mohri\n |first       = M.\n |year        = 2002\n |title       = Edit-Distance of Weighted Automata: General Definitions and Algorithms\n |url         = http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/edit.pdf\n |journal     = International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science\n |volume      = 14\n |issue       = 6\n |pages       = 957\u2013982\n |doi         = 10.1142/S0129054103002114\n |accessdate  = 28 March 2011\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120318032640/http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/edit.pdf\n |archivedate = 18 March 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\n===Dynamic time warping (DTW)-based speech recognition===\n{{Main|Dynamic time warping}}\n\nDynamic time warping is an approach that was historically used for speech recognition but has now largely been displaced by the more successful HMM-based approach.\n\nDynamic time warping is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two sequences that may vary in time or speed. For instance, similarities in walking patterns would be detected, even if in one video the person was walking slowly and if in another he or she were walking more quickly, or even if there were accelerations and deceleration during the course of one observation. DTW has been applied to video, audio, and graphics&nbsp;\u2013 indeed, any data that can be turned into a linear representation can be analyzed with DTW.\n\nA well-known application has been automatic speech recognition, to cope with different speaking speeds. In general, it is a method that allows a computer to find an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g., time series) with certain restrictions. That is, the sequences are \"warped\" non-linearly to match each other. This sequence alignment method is often used in the context of hidden Markov models.\n\n===Neural networks===\n{{Main|Artificial neural network}}\nNeural networks emerged as an attractive acoustic modeling approach in ASR in the late 1980s.

Traditional phonetic-based (i.e., all [[Hidden Markov model|HMM]]-based model) approaches required separate components and training for the pronunciation, acoustic and [[language model]]. End-to-end models jointly learn all the components of the speech recognizer. This is valuable since it simplifies the training process and deployment process. For example, a [[N-gram|n-gram language model]] is required for all HMM-based systems, and a typical n-gram language model often takes several gigabytes in memory making them impractical to deploy on mobile devices.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Speech and Language Processing|last=Jurafsky|first=Daniel|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Consequently, modern commercial ASR systems from [[Google]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] (as of 2017) are deployed on the cloud and require a network connection as opposed to the device locally.\n\nThe first attempt at end-to-end ASR was with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based systems introduced by [[Alex Graves (computer scientist)|Alex Graves]] of [[DeepMind|Google DeepMind]] and Navdeep Jaitly of the [[University of Toronto]] in 2014.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Graves|first=Alex|year=2014|title=Towards End-to-End Speech Recognition with Recurrent Neural Networks|journal=ICML|volume=|pages=|via=|url=http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/graves14.pdf}}</ref> The model consisted of [[recurrent neural network]]s and a CTC layer. Jointly, the RNN-CTC model learns the pronunciation and acoustic model together, however it is incapable of learning the language due to [[conditional independence]] assumptions similar to a HMM. Consequently, CTC models can directly learn to map speech acoustics to English characters, but the models make many common spelling mistakes and must rely on a separate language model to clean up the transcripts. Later, [[Baidu]] expanded on the work with extremely large datasets and demonstrated some commercial success in Chinese Mandarin and English.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Amodei|first=Dario|year=2016|title=Deep Speech 2: End-to-End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin|eprint=1512.02595|class=cs.CL}}</ref> In 2016, [[University of Oxford]] presented LipNet,<ref>{{cite web|title=LipNet: How easy do you think lipreading is?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa5QGremQf8&list=PLXkuFIFnXUAPIrXKgtIpctv2NuSo7xw3k&index=1 |website=YouTube|accessdate=5 May 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427104009/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa5QGremQf8|archivedate=27 April 2017| df=dmy-all}}</ref> the first end-to-end sentence-level lip reading model, using spatiotemporal convolutions coupled with an RNN-CTC architecture, surpassing human-level performance in a restricted grammar dataset.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Assael|first=Yannis|last2=Shillingford|first2=Brendan|last3=Whiteson|first3=Shimon|last4=de Freitas|first4=Nando|date=5 November 2016 |title=LipNet: End-to-End Sentence-level Lipreading|eprint=1611.01599|class=cs.CV}}</ref> A large-scale CNN-RNN-CTC architecture was presented in 2018 by [[DeepMind|Google DeepMind]] achieving 6 times better performance than human experts.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite arxiv|last=Shillingford|first=Brendan|last2=Assael|first2=Yannis|last3=Hoffman|first3=Matthew W.|last4=Paine|first4=Thomas|last5=Hughes|first5=C\u00edan|last6=Prabhu|first6=Utsav|last7=Liao|first7=Hank|last8=Sak|first8=Hasim|last9=Rao|first9=Kanishka|date=2018-07-13|title=Large-Scale Visual Speech Recognition|eprint=1807.05162|class=cs.CV}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative approach to CTC-based models are attention-based models. Attention-based ASR models were introduced simultaneously by Chan et al. of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and [[Google Brain]] and Bahdanau et al. of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al|University of Montreal]] in 2016.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=William|last2=Jaitly|first2=Navdeep|last3=Le|first3=Quoc|last4=Vinyals|first4=Oriol|year=2016|title=Listen, Attend and Spell: A Neural Network for Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition|journal=ICASSP|volume=|pages=|via=|url=https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/44926.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Bahdanau|first=Dzmitry|year=2016|title=End-to-End Attention-based Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition|eprint=1508.04395|class=cs.CL}}</ref> The model named \"Listen, Attend and Spell\" (LAS), literally \"listens\" to the acoustic signal, pays \"attention\" to different parts of the signal and \"spells\" out the transcript one character at a time. Unlike CTC-based models, attention-based models do not have conditional-independence assumptions and can learn all the components of a speech recognizer including the pronunciation, acoustic and language model directly. This means, during deployment, there is no need to carry around a language model making it very practical for applications with limited memory. By the end of 2016, the attention-based models have seen considerable success including outperforming the CTC models (with or without an external language model).<ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Chorowski|first=Jan|last2=Jaitly|first2=Navdeep|date=8 December 2016 |title=Towards better decoding and language model integration in sequence to sequence models|eprint=1612.02695|class=cs.NE}}</ref> Various extensions have been proposed since the original LAS model.

Following the audio prompt, the system has a \"listening window\" during which it may accept a speech input for recognition.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n \nSimple voice commands may be used to initiate phone calls, select radio stations or play music from a compatible smartphone, MP3 player or music-loaded flash drive. Voice recognition capabilities vary between car make and model. Some of the most recent{{When|date=April 2014}} car models offer natural-language speech recognition in place of a fixed set of commands, allowing the driver to use full sentences and common phrases. With such systems there is, therefore, no need for the user to memorize a set of fixed command words.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Health care===\n\n====Medical documentation====\nIn the [[health care]] sector, speech recognition can be implemented in front-end or back-end of the medical documentation process. Front-end speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a speech-recognition engine, the recognized words are displayed as they are spoken, and the dictator is responsible for editing and signing off on the document. Back-end or deferred speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a [[digital dictation]] system, the voice is routed through a speech-recognition machine and the recognized draft document is routed along with the original voice file to the editor, where the draft is edited and report finalized. Deferred speech recognition is widely used in the industry currently.\n\nOne of the major issues relating to the use of speech recognition in healthcare is that the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] ([[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|ARRA]]) provides for substantial financial benefits to physicians who utilize an EMR according to \"Meaningful Use\" standards. These standards require that a substantial amount of data be maintained by the EMR (now more commonly referred to as an [[Electronic Health Record]] or EHR). The use of speech recognition is more naturally suited to the generation of narrative text, as part of a radiology/pathology interpretation, progress note or discharge summary: the ergonomic gains of using speech recognition to enter structured discrete data (e.g., numeric values or codes from a list or a [[controlled vocabulary]]) are relatively minimal for people who are sighted and who can operate a keyboard and mouse.\n\nA more significant issue is that most EHRs have not been expressly tailored to take advantage of voice-recognition capabilities. A large part of the clinician's interaction with the EHR involves navigation through the user interface using menus, and tab/button clicks, and is heavily dependent on keyboard and mouse: voice-based navigation provides only modest ergonomic benefits. By contrast, many highly customized systems for radiology or pathology dictation implement voice \"macros\", where the use of certain phrases \u2013 e.g., \"normal report\", will automatically fill in a large number of default values and/or generate boilerplate, which will vary with the type of the exam \u2013 e.g., a chest X-ray vs. a gastrointestinal contrast series for a radiology system.\n\nAs an alternative to this navigation by hand, cascaded use of speech recognition and [[information extraction]] has been studied<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Suominen |first1=Hanna |last2=Zhou |first2=Liyuan |last3=Hanlen |first3=Leif |last4=Ferraro |first4=Gabriela |year=2015 |title=Benchmarking Clinical Speech Recognition and Information Extraction: New Data, Methods, and Evaluations |journal=JMIR Medical Informatics |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=e19 |doi=10.2196/medinform.4321 |pmid=25917752 |pmc=4427705}}</ref> as a way to fill out a handover form for clinical proofing and sign-off. The results are encouraging, and the paper also opens data, together with the related performance benchmarks and some processing software, to the research and development community for studying clinical documentation and language-processing.\n\n====Therapeutic use====\nProlonged use of speech recognition software in conjunction with [[word processor]]s has shown benefits to short-term-memory restrengthening in [[brain AVM]] patients who have been treated with [[Resection (surgery)|resection]]. Further research needs to be conducted to determine cognitive benefits for individuals whose AVMs have been treated using radiologic techniques.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Military===\n\n====High-performance fighter aircraft====\nSubstantial efforts have been devoted in the last decade to the test and evaluation of speech recognition in [[fighter aircraft]]. Of particular note have been the US program in speech recognition for the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#Technology demonstrators, and test variants#Flight control variants#F-16 Advanced Fighter Technology Integration|Advanced Fighter Technology Integration (AFTI)]]/[[F-16]] aircraft ([[F-16 VISTA]]), the program in France for [[Mirage (aircraft)|Mirage]] aircraft, and other programs in the UK dealing with a variety of aircraft platforms. In these programs, speech recognizers have been operated successfully in fighter aircraft, with applications including: setting radio frequencies, commanding an autopilot system, setting steer-point coordinates and weapons release parameters, and controlling flight display.\n\nWorking with Swedish pilots flying in the [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen|JAS-39]] Gripen cockpit, Englund (2004) found recognition deteriorated with increasing [[g-force|g-loads]]. The report also concluded that adaptation greatly improved the results in all cases and that the introduction of models for breathing was shown to improve recognition scores significantly. Contrary to what might have been expected, no effects of the broken English of the speakers were found. It was evident that spontaneous speech caused problems for the recognizer, as might have been expected. A restricted vocabulary, and above all, a proper syntax, could thus be expected to improve recognition accuracy substantially.<ref>{{cite thesis|url=http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/1664.pdf|title=Speech recognition in the JAS&nbsp;39 Gripen aircraft: Adaptation to speech at different G-loads|first=Christine |last=Englund |publisher=[[Stockholm University|Stockholm Royal Institute of Technology]] |type=Masters thesis |year=2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002002102/http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/1664.pdf|archivedate=2 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], currently in service with the UK [[RAF]], employs a speaker-dependent system, requiring each pilot to create a template.

Voice commands are confirmed by visual and/or aural feedback.

These systems have produced word accuracy scores in excess of 98%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123071861|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020030310/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123071861|archivedate=20 October 2007|first=John|last=Schutte|title=Researchers fine-tune F-35 pilot-aircraft speech system|date=15 October 2007|publisher=United States Air Force}}</ref>\n\n====Helicopters====\nThe problems of achieving high recognition accuracy under stress and noise pertain strongly to the [[helicopter]] environment as well as to the jet fighter environment. The acoustic noise problem is actually more severe in the helicopter environment, not only because of the high noise levels but also because the helicopter pilot, in general, does not wear a [[Fighter pilot helmet|facemask]], which would reduce acoustic noise in the [[microphone]]. Substantial test and evaluation programs have been carried out in the past decade in speech recognition systems applications in helicopters, notably by the [[U.S. Army]] Avionics Research and Development Activity (AVRADA) and by the Royal Aerospace Establishment ([[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]]) in the UK. Work in France has included speech recognition in the [[Puma helicopter]]. There has also been much useful work in [[Canada]]. Results have been encouraging, and voice applications have included: control of communication radios, setting of [[navigation]] systems, and control of an automated target handover system.\n\nAs in fighter applications, the overriding issue for voice in helicopters is the impact on pilot effectiveness. Encouraging results are reported for the AVRADA tests, although these represent only a feasibility demonstration in a test environment. Much remains to be done both in speech recognition and in overall [[speech technology]] in order to consistently achieve performance improvements in operational settings.\n\n====Training air traffic controllers====\nTraining for air traffic controllers (ATC) represents an excellent application for speech recognition systems. Many ATC training systems currently require a person to act as a \"pseudo-pilot\", engaging in a voice dialog with the trainee controller, which simulates the dialog that the controller would have to conduct with pilots in a real ATC situation. Speech recognition and [[speech synthesis|synthesis]] techniques offer the potential to eliminate the need for a person to act as pseudo-pilot, thus reducing training and support personnel. In theory, Air controller tasks are also characterized by highly structured speech as the primary output of the controller, hence reducing the difficulty of the speech recognition task should be possible. In practice, this is rarely the case. The FAA document 7110.65 details the phrases that should be used by air traffic controllers. While this document gives less than 150 examples of such phrases, the number of phrases supported by one of the simulation vendors speech recognition systems is in excess of 500,000.\n\nThe USAF, USMC, US Army, US Navy, and FAA as well as a number of international ATC training organizations such as the Royal Australian Air Force and Civil Aviation Authorities in Italy, Brazil, and Canada are currently using ATC simulators with speech recognition from a number of different vendors.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Telephony and other domains===\nASR is now commonplace in the field of [[telephony]] and is becoming more widespread in the field of [[computer gaming]] and simulation. In telephony systems, ASR is now being predominantly used in contact centers by integrating it with [[IVR]] systems. Despite the high level of integration with word processing in general personal computing, in the field of document production, ASR has not seen the expected increases in use.\n\nThe improvement of mobile processor speeds has made speech recognition practical in [[smartphone]]s. Speech is used mostly as a part of a user interface, for creating predefined or custom speech commands.\n\n=== Usage in education and daily life ===\nFor [[language learning]], speech recognition can be useful for learning a [[second language]].

Other measures of accuracy include [[Single Word Error Rate]] (SWER) and [[Command Success Rate]] (CSR).\n\nSpeech recognition by machine is a very complex problem, however. Vocalizations vary in terms of accent, pronunciation, articulation, roughness, nasality, pitch, volume, and speed. Speech is distorted by a background noise and echoes, electrical characteristics. Accuracy of speech recognition may vary with the following:<ref>National Institute of Standards and Technology. \"[http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/publications/ASRhistory/ The History of Automatic Speech Recognition Evaluation at NIST] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008210040/http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/publications/ASRhistory/ |date=8 October 2013 }}\".</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n* Vocabulary size and confusability\n* Speaker dependence versus independence\n* Isolated, discontinuous or continuous speech\n* Task and language constraints\n* Read versus spontaneous speech\n* Adverse conditions\n\n===Accuracy===\nAs mentioned earlier in this article, accuracy of speech recognition may vary depending on the following factors:\n* Error rates increase as the vocabulary size grows: \n::e.g. the 10 digits \"zero\" to \"nine\" can be recognized essentially perfectly, but vocabulary sizes of 200, 5000 or 100000 may have error rates of 3%, 7% or 45% respectively.\n* Vocabulary is hard to recognize if it contains confusing words:\n::e.g. the 26 letters of the English alphabet are difficult to discriminate because they are confusing words (most notoriously, the E-set: \"B, C, D, E, G, P, T, V, Z\"); an 8% error rate is considered good for this vocabulary.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* Speaker dependence vs. independence:\n::A speaker-dependent system is intended for use by a single speaker.\n::A speaker-independent system is intended for use by any speaker (more difficult).\n* Isolated, Discontinuous or continuous speech\n::With isolated speech, single words are used, therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech.\nWith discontinuous speech full sentences separated by silence are used, therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech as well as with isolated speech. <br />\nWith continuous speech naturally spoken sentences are used, therefore it becomes harder to recognize the speech, different from both isolated and discontinuous speech.\n\n* Task and language constraints\n**e.g. Querying application may dismiss the hypothesis \"The apple is red.\"\n**e.g. Constraints may be semantic; rejecting \"The apple is angry.\"\n**e.g. Syntactic; rejecting \"Red is apple the.\"\n\nConstraints are often represented by a grammar. \n* Read vs. Spontaneous Speech \u2013 When a person reads it's usually in a context that has been previously prepared, but when a person uses spontaneous speech, it is difficult to recognize the speech because of the disfluencies (like \"uh\" and \"um\", false starts, incomplete sentences, stuttering, coughing, and laughter) and limited vocabulary. \n* Adverse conditions \u2013 Environmental noise (e.g. Noise in a car or a factory). Acoustical distortions (e.g. echoes, room acoustics)\nSpeech recognition is a multi-leveled pattern recognition task.\n* Acoustical signals are structured into a hierarchy of units, e.g. [[Phoneme]]s, Words, Phrases, and Sentences;\n* Each level provides additional constraints;\ne.g. Known word pronunciations or legal word sequences, which can compensate for errors or uncertainties at lower level;\n* This hierarchy of constraints are exploited. By combining decisions probabilistically at all lower levels, and making more deterministic decisions only at the highest level, speech recognition by a machine is a process broken into several phases. Computationally, it is a problem in which a sound pattern has to be recognized or classified into a category that represents a meaning to a human. Every acoustic signal can be broken in smaller more basic sub-signals. As the more complex sound signal is broken into the smaller sub-sounds, different levels are created, where at the top level we have complex sounds, which are made of simpler sounds on lower level, and going to lower levels even more, we create more basic and shorter and simpler sounds. The lowest level, where the sounds are the most fundamental, a machine would check for simple and more probabilistic rules of what sound should represent. Once these sounds are put together into more complex sound on upper level, a new set of more deterministic rules should predict what new complex sound should represent. The most upper level of a deterministic rule should figure out the meaning of complex expressions. In order to expand our knowledge about speech recognition we need to take into a consideration neural networks. There are four steps of neural network approaches: \n* Digitize the speech that we want to recognize\nFor telephone speech the sampling rate is 8000 samples per second; \n* Compute features of spectral-domain of the speech (with Fourier transform);\ncomputed every 10&nbsp;ms, with one 10&nbsp;ms section called a frame;\n\nAnalysis of four-step neural network approaches can be explained by further information. Sound is produced by air (or some other medium) vibration, which we register by ears, but machines by receivers. Basic sound creates a wave which has two descriptions: [[amplitude]] (how strong is it), and [[frequency]] (how often it vibrates per second).\nAccuracy can be computed with the help of word error rate (WER). Word error rate can be calculated by aligning the recognized word and referenced word using dynamic string alignment. The problem may occur while computing the word error rate due to the difference between the sequence lengths of recognized word and referenced word. \nLet, S be the number of substitutions,\n  D be the number of deletions,\n  I be the number of insertions,\n  N be the number of word references.\nThe formula to compute the word error rate(WER) is \n       WER = (S+D+I)\u00f7N\nWhile computing the word recognition rate (WRR) word error rate (WER) is used and the formula is \n       WRR = 1- WER\n           = (N-S-D-I)\u00f7 N = (H-I)\u00f7N\nHere H is the number of correctly recognized words. H= N-(S+D).\n\n===Security concerns===\nSpeech recognition can become a means of attack, theft, or accidental operation. For example, activation words like \"Alexa\" spoken in an audio or video broadcast can cause devices in homes and offices to start listening for input inappropriately, or possibly take an unwanted action.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/03/06/469383361/listen-up-your-ai-assistant-goes-crazy-for-npr-too |title=Listen Up: Your AI Assistant Goes Crazy For NPR Too |work=[[NPR]] |date=6 March 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723210358/http://www.npr.org/2016/03/06/469383361/listen-up-your-ai-assistant-goes-crazy-for-npr-too |archivedate=23 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Voice-controlled devices are also accessible to visitors to the building, or even those outside the building if they can be heard inside.

Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used in many systems. Language modeling is also used in many other natural language processing applications such as [[document classification]] or [[statistical machine translation]].\n\n===Hidden Markov models===\n{{Main|Hidden Markov model}}\nModern general-purpose speech recognition systems are based on Hidden Markov Models. These are statistical models that output a sequence of symbols or quantities. HMMs are used in speech recognition because a speech signal can be viewed as a piecewise stationary signal or a short-time stationary signal. In a short time-scale (e.g., 10 milliseconds), speech can be approximated as a [[stationary process]]. Speech can be thought of as a [[Markov model]] for many stochastic purposes.\n\nAnother reason why HMMs are popular is because they can be trained automatically and are simple and computationally feasible to use. In speech recognition, the hidden Markov model would output a sequence of ''n''-dimensional real-valued vectors (with ''n'' being a small integer, such as 10), outputting one of these every 10 milliseconds. The vectors would consist of [[cepstrum|cepstral]] coefficients, which are obtained by taking a [[Fourier transform]] of a short time window of speech and decorrelating the spectrum using a [[cosine transform]], then taking the first (most significant) coefficients. The hidden Markov model will tend to have in each state a statistical distribution that is a mixture of diagonal covariance Gaussians, which will give a likelihood for each observed vector. Each word, or (for more general speech recognition systems), each [[phoneme]], will have a different output distribution; a hidden Markov model for a sequence of words or phonemes is made by concatenating the individual trained hidden Markov models for the separate words and phonemes.\n\nDescribed above are the core elements of the most common, HMM-based approach to speech recognition. Modern speech recognition systems use various combinations of a number of standard techniques in order to improve results over the basic approach described above. A typical large-vocabulary system would need [[context dependency]] for the phonemes (so phonemes with different left and right context have different realizations as HMM states); it would use [[cepstral normalization]] to normalize for different speaker and recording conditions; for further speaker normalization it might use vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) for male-female normalization and [[maximum likelihood linear regression]] (MLLR) for more general speaker adaptation. The features would have so-called [[delta coefficient|delta]] and [[delta-delta coefficient]]s to capture speech dynamics and in addition might use [[heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis]] (HLDA); or might skip the delta and delta-delta coefficients and use [[splicing (speech recognition)|splicing]] and an [[Linear Discriminant Analysis|LDA]]-based projection followed perhaps by [[heteroscedastic]] linear discriminant analysis or a [[global semi-tied co variance]] transform (also known as [[maximum likelihood linear transform]], or MLLT). Many systems use so-called discriminative training techniques that dispense with a purely statistical approach to HMM parameter estimation and instead optimize some classification-related measure of the training data. Examples are maximum [[mutual information]] (MMI), minimum classification error (MCE) and minimum phone error (MPE).\n\nDecoding of the speech (the term for what happens when the system is presented with a new utterance and must compute the most likely source sentence) would probably use the [[Viterbi algorithm]] to find the best path, and here there is a choice between dynamically creating a combination hidden Markov model, which includes both the acoustic and language model information, and combining it statically beforehand (the [[finite state transducer]], or FST, approach).\n\nA possible improvement to decoding is to keep a set of good candidates instead of just keeping the best candidate, and to use a better scoring function ([[re scoring (ASR)|re scoring]]) to rate these good candidates so that we may pick the best one according to this refined score. The set of candidates can be kept either as a list (the [[N-best list]] approach) or as a subset of the models (a [[lattice (order)|lattice]]). Re scoring is usually done by trying to minimize the [[Bayes risk]]<ref>{{cite journal\n |last1       = Goel\n |first1      = Vaibhava\n |last2       = Byrne\n |first2      = William J.\n |year        = 2000\n |title       = Minimum Bayes-risk automatic speech recognition\n |url         = http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/people/vgoel/publications/CSAL.ps\n |journal     = Computer Speech & Language\n |volume      = 14\n |issue       = 2\n |pages       = 115\u2013135\n |doi         = 10.1006/csla.2000.0138\n |accessdate  = 28 March 2011\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725225846/http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/people/vgoel/publications/CSAL.ps\n |archivedate = 25 July 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> (or an approximation thereof): Instead of taking the source sentence with maximal probability, we try to take the sentence that minimizes the expectancy of a given loss function with regards to all possible transcriptions (i.e., we take the sentence that minimizes the average distance to other possible sentences weighted by their estimated probability). The loss function is usually the [[Levenshtein distance]], though it can be different distances for specific tasks; the set of possible transcriptions is, of course, pruned to maintain tractability. Efficient algorithms have been devised to re score [[lattice (order)|lattices]] represented as weighted [[finite state transducers]] with [[edit distance]]s represented themselves as a [[finite state transducer]] verifying certain assumptions.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last        = Mohri\n |first       = M.\n |year        = 2002\n |title       = Edit-Distance of Weighted Automata: General Definitions and Algorithms\n |url         = http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/edit.pdf\n |journal     = International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science\n |volume      = 14\n |issue       = 6\n |pages       = 957\u2013982\n |doi         = 10.1142/S0129054103002114\n |accessdate  = 28 March 2011\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120318032640/http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/edit.pdf\n |archivedate = 18 March 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\n===Dynamic time warping (DTW)-based speech recognition===\n{{Main|Dynamic time warping}}\n\nDynamic time warping is an approach that was historically used for speech recognition but has now largely been displaced by the more successful HMM-based approach.\n\nDynamic time warping is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two sequences that may vary in time or speed. For instance, similarities in walking patterns would be detected, even if in one video the person was walking slowly and if in another he or she were walking more quickly, or even if there were accelerations and deceleration during the course of one observation. DTW has been applied to video, audio, and graphics&nbsp;\u2013 indeed, any data that can be turned into a linear representation can be analyzed with DTW.\n\nA well-known application has been automatic speech recognition, to cope with different speaking speeds. In general, it is a method that allows a computer to find an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g., time series) with certain restrictions. That is, the sequences are \"warped\" non-linearly to match each other. This sequence alignment method is often used in the context of hidden Markov models.\n\n===Neural networks===\n{{Main|Artificial neural network}}\nNeural networks emerged as an attractive acoustic modeling approach in ASR in the late 1980s.

Traditional phonetic-based (i.e., all [[Hidden Markov model|HMM]]-based model) approaches required separate components and training for the pronunciation, acoustic and [[language model]]. End-to-end models jointly learn all the components of the speech recognizer. This is valuable since it simplifies the training process and deployment process. For example, a [[N-gram|n-gram language model]] is required for all HMM-based systems, and a typical n-gram language model often takes several gigabytes in memory making them impractical to deploy on mobile devices.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Speech and Language Processing|last=Jurafsky|first=Daniel|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Consequently, modern commercial ASR systems from [[Google]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] (as of 2017) are deployed on the cloud and require a network connection as opposed to the device locally.\n\nThe first attempt at end-to-end ASR was with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based systems introduced by [[Alex Graves (computer scientist)|Alex Graves]] of [[DeepMind|Google DeepMind]] and Navdeep Jaitly of the [[University of Toronto]] in 2014.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Graves|first=Alex|year=2014|title=Towards End-to-End Speech Recognition with Recurrent Neural Networks|journal=ICML|volume=|pages=|via=|url=http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/graves14.pdf}}</ref> The model consisted of [[recurrent neural network]]s and a CTC layer. Jointly, the RNN-CTC model learns the pronunciation and acoustic model together, however it is incapable of learning the language due to [[conditional independence]] assumptions similar to a HMM. Consequently, CTC models can directly learn to map speech acoustics to English characters, but the models make many common spelling mistakes and must rely on a separate language model to clean up the transcripts. Later, [[Baidu]] expanded on the work with extremely large datasets and demonstrated some commercial success in Chinese Mandarin and English.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Amodei|first=Dario|year=2016|title=Deep Speech 2: End-to-End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin|eprint=1512.02595|class=cs.CL}}</ref> In 2016, [[University of Oxford]] presented LipNet,<ref>{{cite web|title=LipNet: How easy do you think lipreading is?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa5QGremQf8&list=PLXkuFIFnXUAPIrXKgtIpctv2NuSo7xw3k&index=1 |website=YouTube|accessdate=5 May 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427104009/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa5QGremQf8|archivedate=27 April 2017| df=dmy-all}}</ref> the first end-to-end sentence-level lip reading model, using spatiotemporal convolutions coupled with an RNN-CTC architecture, surpassing human-level performance in a restricted grammar dataset.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Assael|first=Yannis|last2=Shillingford|first2=Brendan|last3=Whiteson|first3=Shimon|last4=de Freitas|first4=Nando|date=5 November 2016 |title=LipNet: End-to-End Sentence-level Lipreading|eprint=1611.01599|class=cs.CV}}</ref> A large-scale CNN-RNN-CTC architecture was presented in 2018 by [[DeepMind|Google DeepMind]] achieving 6 times better performance than human experts.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite arxiv|last=Shillingford|first=Brendan|last2=Assael|first2=Yannis|last3=Hoffman|first3=Matthew W.|last4=Paine|first4=Thomas|last5=Hughes|first5=C\u00edan|last6=Prabhu|first6=Utsav|last7=Liao|first7=Hank|last8=Sak|first8=Hasim|last9=Rao|first9=Kanishka|date=2018-07-13|title=Large-Scale Visual Speech Recognition|eprint=1807.05162|class=cs.CV}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative approach to CTC-based models are attention-based models. Attention-based ASR models were introduced simultaneously by Chan et al. of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and [[Google Brain]] and Bahdanau et al. of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al|University of Montreal]] in 2016.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chan|first=William|last2=Jaitly|first2=Navdeep|last3=Le|first3=Quoc|last4=Vinyals|first4=Oriol|year=2016|title=Listen, Attend and Spell: A Neural Network for Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition|journal=ICASSP|volume=|pages=|via=|url=https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/44926.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Bahdanau|first=Dzmitry|year=2016|title=End-to-End Attention-based Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition|eprint=1508.04395|class=cs.CL}}</ref> The model named \"Listen, Attend and Spell\" (LAS), literally \"listens\" to the acoustic signal, pays \"attention\" to different parts of the signal and \"spells\" out the transcript one character at a time. Unlike CTC-based models, attention-based models do not have conditional-independence assumptions and can learn all the components of a speech recognizer including the pronunciation, acoustic and language model directly. This means, during deployment, there is no need to carry around a language model making it very practical for applications with limited memory. By the end of 2016, the attention-based models have seen considerable success including outperforming the CTC models (with or without an external language model).<ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Chorowski|first=Jan|last2=Jaitly|first2=Navdeep|date=8 December 2016 |title=Towards better decoding and language model integration in sequence to sequence models|eprint=1612.02695|class=cs.NE}}</ref> Various extensions have been proposed since the original LAS model.

Following the audio prompt, the system has a \"listening window\" during which it may accept a speech input for recognition.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n \nSimple voice commands may be used to initiate phone calls, select radio stations or play music from a compatible smartphone, MP3 player or music-loaded flash drive. Voice recognition capabilities vary between car make and model. Some of the most recent{{When|date=April 2014}} car models offer natural-language speech recognition in place of a fixed set of commands, allowing the driver to use full sentences and common phrases. With such systems there is, therefore, no need for the user to memorize a set of fixed command words.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Health care===\n\n====Medical documentation====\nIn the [[health care]] sector, speech recognition can be implemented in front-end or back-end of the medical documentation process. Front-end speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a speech-recognition engine, the recognized words are displayed as they are spoken, and the dictator is responsible for editing and signing off on the document. Back-end or deferred speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a [[digital dictation]] system, the voice is routed through a speech-recognition machine and the recognized draft document is routed along with the original voice file to the editor, where the draft is edited and report finalized. Deferred speech recognition is widely used in the industry currently.\n\nOne of the major issues relating to the use of speech recognition in healthcare is that the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] ([[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|ARRA]]) provides for substantial financial benefits to physicians who utilize an EMR according to \"Meaningful Use\" standards. These standards require that a substantial amount of data be maintained by the EMR (now more commonly referred to as an [[Electronic Health Record]] or EHR). The use of speech recognition is more naturally suited to the generation of narrative text, as part of a radiology/pathology interpretation, progress note or discharge summary: the ergonomic gains of using speech recognition to enter structured discrete data (e.g., numeric values or codes from a list or a [[controlled vocabulary]]) are relatively minimal for people who are sighted and who can operate a keyboard and mouse.\n\nA more significant issue is that most EHRs have not been expressly tailored to take advantage of voice-recognition capabilities. A large part of the clinician's interaction with the EHR involves navigation through the user interface using menus, and tab/button clicks, and is heavily dependent on keyboard and mouse: voice-based navigation provides only modest ergonomic benefits. By contrast, many highly customized systems for radiology or pathology dictation implement voice \"macros\", where the use of certain phrases \u2013 e.g., \"normal report\", will automatically fill in a large number of default values and/or generate boilerplate, which will vary with the type of the exam \u2013 e.g., a chest X-ray vs. a gastrointestinal contrast series for a radiology system.\n\nAs an alternative to this navigation by hand, cascaded use of speech recognition and [[information extraction]] has been studied<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Suominen |first1=Hanna |last2=Zhou |first2=Liyuan |last3=Hanlen |first3=Leif |last4=Ferraro |first4=Gabriela |year=2015 |title=Benchmarking Clinical Speech Recognition and Information Extraction: New Data, Methods, and Evaluations |journal=JMIR Medical Informatics |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=e19 |doi=10.2196/medinform.4321 |pmid=25917752 |pmc=4427705}}</ref> as a way to fill out a handover form for clinical proofing and sign-off. The results are encouraging, and the paper also opens data, together with the related performance benchmarks and some processing software, to the research and development community for studying clinical documentation and language-processing.\n\n====Therapeutic use====\nProlonged use of speech recognition software in conjunction with [[word processor]]s has shown benefits to short-term-memory restrengthening in [[brain AVM]] patients who have been treated with [[Resection (surgery)|resection]]. Further research needs to be conducted to determine cognitive benefits for individuals whose AVMs have been treated using radiologic techniques.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Military===\n\n====High-performance fighter aircraft====\nSubstantial efforts have been devoted in the last decade to the test and evaluation of speech recognition in [[fighter aircraft]]. Of particular note have been the US program in speech recognition for the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#Technology demonstrators, and test variants#Flight control variants#F-16 Advanced Fighter Technology Integration|Advanced Fighter Technology Integration (AFTI)]]/[[F-16]] aircraft ([[F-16 VISTA]]), the program in France for [[Mirage (aircraft)|Mirage]] aircraft, and other programs in the UK dealing with a variety of aircraft platforms. In these programs, speech recognizers have been operated successfully in fighter aircraft, with applications including: setting radio frequencies, commanding an autopilot system, setting steer-point coordinates and weapons release parameters, and controlling flight display.\n\nWorking with Swedish pilots flying in the [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen|JAS-39]] Gripen cockpit, Englund (2004) found recognition deteriorated with increasing [[g-force|g-loads]]. The report also concluded that adaptation greatly improved the results in all cases and that the introduction of models for breathing was shown to improve recognition scores significantly. Contrary to what might have been expected, no effects of the broken English of the speakers were found. It was evident that spontaneous speech caused problems for the recognizer, as might have been expected. A restricted vocabulary, and above all, a proper syntax, could thus be expected to improve recognition accuracy substantially.<ref>{{cite thesis|url=http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/1664.pdf|title=Speech recognition in the JAS&nbsp;39 Gripen aircraft: Adaptation to speech at different G-loads|first=Christine |last=Englund |publisher=[[Stockholm University|Stockholm Royal Institute of Technology]] |type=Masters thesis |year=2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002002102/http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/1664.pdf|archivedate=2 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], currently in service with the UK [[RAF]], employs a speaker-dependent system, requiring each pilot to create a template. The system is not used for any safety-critical or weapon-critical tasks, such as weapon release or lowering of the undercarriage, but is used for a wide range of other cockpit functions. Voice commands are confirmed by visual and/or aural feedback. The system is seen as a major design feature in the reduction of pilot [[workload]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurofighter.com/the-aircraft#cockpit|title=The Cockpit |website=Eurofighter Typhoon |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301222529/https://www.eurofighter.com/the-aircraft#cockpit |archivedate=1 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and even allows the pilot to assign targets to his aircraft with two simple voice commands or to any of his wingmen with only five commands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurofighter.com/capabilities/technology/voice-throttle-stick/direct-voice-input.html |title=Eurofighter Typhoon \u2013 The world's most advanced fighter aircraft |website=www.eurofighter.com |accessdate=1 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511025203/http://www.eurofighter.com/capabilities/technology/voice-throttle-stick/direct-voice-input.html |archivedate=11 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSpeaker-independent systems are also being developed and are under test for the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F35 Lightning II]] (JSF) and the [[Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master]] lead-in fighter trainer. These systems have produced word accuracy scores in excess of 98%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123071861|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020030310/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123071861|archivedate=20 October 2007|first=John|last=Schutte|title=Researchers fine-tune F-35 pilot-aircraft speech system|date=15 October 2007|publisher=United States Air Force}}</ref>\n\n====Helicopters====\nThe problems of achieving high recognition accuracy under stress and noise pertain strongly to the [[helicopter]] environment as well as to the jet fighter environment. The acoustic noise problem is actually more severe in the helicopter environment, not only because of the high noise levels but also because the helicopter pilot, in general, does not wear a [[Fighter pilot helmet|facemask]], which would reduce acoustic noise in the [[microphone]]. Substantial test and evaluation programs have been carried out in the past decade in speech recognition systems applications in helicopters, notably by the [[U.S. Army]] Avionics Research and Development Activity (AVRADA) and by the Royal Aerospace Establishment ([[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]]) in the UK. Work in France has included speech recognition in the [[Puma helicopter]]. There has also been much useful work in [[Canada]]. Results have been encouraging, and voice applications have included: control of communication radios, setting of [[navigation]] systems, and control of an automated target handover system.\n\nAs in fighter applications, the overriding issue for voice in helicopters is the impact on pilot effectiveness. Encouraging results are reported for the AVRADA tests, although these represent only a feasibility demonstration in a test environment. Much remains to be done both in speech recognition and in overall [[speech technology]] in order to consistently achieve performance improvements in operational settings.\n\n====Training air traffic controllers====\nTraining for air traffic controllers (ATC) represents an excellent application for speech recognition systems. Many ATC training systems currently require a person to act as a \"pseudo-pilot\", engaging in a voice dialog with the trainee controller, which simulates the dialog that the controller would have to conduct with pilots in a real ATC situation. Speech recognition and [[speech synthesis|synthesis]] techniques offer the potential to eliminate the need for a person to act as pseudo-pilot, thus reducing training and support personnel. In theory, Air controller tasks are also characterized by highly structured speech as the primary output of the controller, hence reducing the difficulty of the speech recognition task should be possible. In practice, this is rarely the case. The FAA document 7110.65 details the phrases that should be used by air traffic controllers. While this document gives less than 150 examples of such phrases, the number of phrases supported by one of the simulation vendors speech recognition systems is in excess of 500,000.\n\nThe USAF, USMC, US Army, US Navy, and FAA as well as a number of international ATC training organizations such as the Royal Australian Air Force and Civil Aviation Authorities in Italy, Brazil, and Canada are currently using ATC simulators with speech recognition from a number of different vendors.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Telephony and other domains===\nASR is now commonplace in the field of [[telephony]] and is becoming more widespread in the field of [[computer gaming]] and simulation. In telephony systems, ASR is now being predominantly used in contact centers by integrating it with [[IVR]] systems. Despite the high level of integration with word processing in general personal computing, in the field of document production, ASR has not seen the expected increases in use.\n\nThe improvement of mobile processor speeds has made speech recognition practical in [[smartphone]]s. Speech is used mostly as a part of a user interface, for creating predefined or custom speech commands.\n\n=== Usage in education and daily life ===\nFor [[language learning]], speech recognition can be useful for learning a [[second language]].

Other measures of accuracy include [[Single Word Error Rate]] (SWER) and [[Command Success Rate]] (CSR).\n\nSpeech recognition by machine is a very complex problem, however. Vocalizations vary in terms of accent, pronunciation, articulation, roughness, nasality, pitch, volume, and speed. Speech is distorted by a background noise and echoes, electrical characteristics. Accuracy of speech recognition may vary with the following:<ref>National Institute of Standards and Technology. \"[http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/publications/ASRhistory/ The History of Automatic Speech Recognition Evaluation at NIST] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008210040/http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/publications/ASRhistory/ |date=8 October 2013 }}\".</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n* Vocabulary size and confusability\n* Speaker dependence versus independence\n* Isolated, discontinuous or continuous speech\n* Task and language constraints\n* Read versus spontaneous speech\n* Adverse conditions\n\n===Accuracy===\nAs mentioned earlier in this article, accuracy of speech recognition may vary depending on the following factors:\n* Error rates increase as the vocabulary size grows: \n::e.g. the 10 digits \"zero\" to \"nine\" can be recognized essentially perfectly, but vocabulary sizes of 200, 5000 or 100000 may have error rates of 3%, 7% or 45% respectively.\n* Vocabulary is hard to recognize if it contains confusing words:\n::e.g. the 26 letters of the English alphabet are difficult to discriminate because they are confusing words (most notoriously, the E-set: \"B, C, D, E, G, P, T, V, Z\"); an 8% error rate is considered good for this vocabulary.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* Speaker dependence vs. independence:\n::A speaker-dependent system is intended for use by a single speaker.\n::A speaker-independent system is intended for use by any speaker (more difficult).\n* Isolated, Discontinuous or continuous speech\n::With isolated speech, single words are used, therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech.\nWith discontinuous speech full sentences separated by silence are used, therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech as well as with isolated speech. <br />\nWith continuous speech naturally spoken sentences are used, therefore it becomes harder to recognize the speech, different from both isolated and discontinuous speech.\n\n* Task and language constraints\n**e.g. Querying application may dismiss the hypothesis \"The apple is red.\"\n**e.g. Constraints may be semantic; rejecting \"The apple is angry.\"\n**e.g. Syntactic; rejecting \"Red is apple the.\"\n\nConstraints are often represented by a grammar. \n* Read vs. Spontaneous Speech \u2013 When a person reads it's usually in a context that has been previously prepared, but when a person uses spontaneous speech, it is difficult to recognize the speech because of the disfluencies (like \"uh\" and \"um\", false starts, incomplete sentences, stuttering, coughing, and laughter) and limited vocabulary. \n* Adverse conditions \u2013 Environmental noise (e.g. Noise in a car or a factory). Acoustical distortions (e.g. echoes, room acoustics)\nSpeech recognition is a multi-leveled pattern recognition task.\n* Acoustical signals are structured into a hierarchy of units, e.g. [[Phoneme]]s, Words, Phrases, and Sentences;\n* Each level provides additional constraints;\ne.g. Known word pronunciations or legal word sequences, which can compensate for errors or uncertainties at lower level;\n* This hierarchy of constraints are exploited. By combining decisions probabilistically at all lower levels, and making more deterministic decisions only at the highest level, speech recognition by a machine is a process broken into several phases. Computationally, it is a problem in which a sound pattern has to be recognized or classified into a category that represents a meaning to a human. Every acoustic signal can be broken in smaller more basic sub-signals. As the more complex sound signal is broken into the smaller sub-sounds, different levels are created, where at the top level we have complex sounds, which are made of simpler sounds on lower level, and going to lower levels even more, we create more basic and shorter and simpler sounds. The lowest level, where the sounds are the most fundamental, a machine would check for simple and more probabilistic rules of what sound should represent. Once these sounds are put together into more complex sound on upper level, a new set of more deterministic rules should predict what new complex sound should represent. The most upper level of a deterministic rule should figure out the meaning of complex expressions. In order to expand our knowledge about speech recognition we need to take into a consideration neural networks. There are four steps of neural network approaches: \n* Digitize the speech that we want to recognize\nFor telephone speech the sampling rate is 8000 samples per second; \n* Compute features of spectral-domain of the speech (with Fourier transform);\ncomputed every 10&nbsp;ms, with one 10&nbsp;ms section called a frame;\n\nAnalysis of four-step neural network approaches can be explained by further information. Sound is produced by air (or some other medium) vibration, which we register by ears, but machines by receivers. Basic sound creates a wave which has two descriptions: [[amplitude]] (how strong is it), and [[frequency]] (how often it vibrates per second).\nAccuracy can be computed with the help of word error rate (WER). Word error rate can be calculated by aligning the recognized word and referenced word using dynamic string alignment. The problem may occur while computing the word error rate due to the difference between the sequence lengths of recognized word and referenced word. \nLet, S be the number of substitutions,\n  D be the number of deletions,\n  I be the number of insertions,\n  N be the number of word references.\nThe formula to compute the word error rate(WER) is \n       WER = (S+D+I)\u00f7N\nWhile computing the word recognition rate (WRR) word error rate (WER) is used and the formula is \n       WRR = 1- WER\n           = (N-S-D-I)\u00f7 N = (H-I)\u00f7N\nHere H is the number of correctly recognized words. H= N-(S+D).\n\n===Security concerns===\nSpeech recognition can become a means of attack, theft, or accidental operation. For example, activation words like \"Alexa\" spoken in an audio or video broadcast can cause devices in homes and offices to start listening for input inappropriately, or possibly take an unwanted action.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/03/06/469383361/listen-up-your-ai-assistant-goes-crazy-for-npr-too |title=Listen Up: Your AI Assistant Goes Crazy For NPR Too |work=[[NPR]] |date=6 March 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723210358/http://www.npr.org/2016/03/06/469383361/listen-up-your-ai-assistant-goes-crazy-for-npr-too |archivedate=23 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Voice-controlled devices are also accessible to visitors to the building, or even those outside the building if they can be heard inside.

The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals.

During the course of these tours, members are generally seen dressed in simple, white, loose-clothing, carrying sleeping bags on their backs.<ref name=womenbm/> These members use mosques as their base during this travel but particular mosques, due to more frequent tablighiyat activities, have come to be specifically associated with this organisation. These mosques generally hold the periodic, smaller scale convocations for neighbourhood members.<ref name=\"bmppp\"/>\n\nDuring their stay in mosques, these ''jamaats'' conduct a daily ''gasht'', which involves visiting local neighbourhoods, preferably with the help of a guide.<ref name=Eva/> They invite people to attend the ''[[Maghrib]]'' prayer at their mosque and those who attend are delivered a sermon after the prayers, which essentially outlines the Six Principles. They urge the attendees to spend time in tabligh for self reformation and the propagation of Islam.<ref>{{harvnb|Masud|2000|pp=27\u201328}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the assumed role of these ''jamaat'' members cycle in a way that they may be engaged as a preacher, a cook or as a cleaner at other times. Among Tabligh Jamaat members, this is generally referred to as ''khidmat'' which essentially connotes to serving their companions and freeing them for tablighi engagements.<ref name=womenbm/> The members of the Jamaat are assigned these roles based on the day's ''mashwara''. The markaz keeps records of each ''jamaat'' and its members, the identity of whom is verified from their respective mosques.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>  Tablighi Jamaat has been banned in some Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan, where its puritanical preachings are viewed as extremist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-who-are-the-tablighi-jamaat-the-organisation-at-the-epicentre-of-coronavirus-outbreak-in-india/article31238915.ece|title=Explained  Who are the Tablighi Jamaat?}}</ref>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=517}}</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

Even when this is not the case, and particularly in traditional cultures, grandparents often have a direct and clear role in relation to the raising, care and [[nurture]] of [[child]]ren. Grandparents are second-degree relatives and share 25% genetic overlap.\n\nA step-grandparent can be the step-parent of the parent or the step-parent's parent or the step-parent's step-parent (though technically this might be called a step-step-grandparent). The various words for grandparents at times may also be used to refer to any elderly person, especially the terms ''gramps'', ''granny'', ''grandfather'', ''grandmother'', ''nan'', ''maw-maw'', ''paw-paw'', hoo-haw\u201d and others which families make up themselves.\n\n==Titles==\n[[File:GrandfatherAndScooter.JPG|275px|thumb|left|A grandfather teaching his granddaughter to use a [[kick scooter]]]]\nWhen used as a noun (e.g., \"... a grandparent walked by\"), grandfather and grandmother are usually used, although forms such as grandma/grandpa, granny/granddaddy or even nan/pop are sometimes used. When preceded by \"my ...\" (e.g., \"... my grandpa walked by\"), all forms are common (anywhere from \"... my grandfather ...\" to \"... my Gramps ...\"). All forms can be used in plural, but Gramps ([[plural]] Gramps<!--not Grampses-->) is rare.\n\nIn writing, ''Grandfather'' and ''Grandmother'' are most common, but very rare as a form of address. In speech, ''Grandpa'' and ''Grandma'' are commonly used in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and, particularly prevalent in the Canadian province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], ''Nan'', ''Nana'', ''Nanna'', ''Nanny'', ''Gran'' and ''Granny'' and other variations are often used for grandmother in both writing and speech.\n\nIn many parts of [[India]], maternal grandparents are called ''Nana'' and ''Nani''. Similarly, paternal grandparents are called ''Dada'' and ''Dadi''. \nOne's parents' maternal grandparents are called ''Par-nani'' and ''Par-nana''. On similar lines, parents' paternal grandparents are called ''Par-dadi'' and ''Par-dada.''\n \n[[File:Child pushing grandmother on plastic tricycle.jpg|thumb|A grandmother playing with her grandson]]\nNumerous other variants exist, such as ''Gramp'', ''Gramps'', ''Grampa'', ''Grandpap'', ''Granda'', ''Grampy'', ''Granddad'', ''Grandad'', ''Granddaddy'', ''Grandpappy'', ''Pop(s)'',  ''Pap,'' ''Pappy'', and ''Pawpaw'' for grandfather; ''Grandmom'', ''Grandmama'', ''Grama'', ''Granny'', ''Gran'', ''Nanny'', ''Nan'', ''Mammaw, Meemaw'' and ''Grammy'' for grandmother. ''Gogo'' can be used for either, etc.<!--do not add names \u2014 this is sufficient-->\n\nGiven that people may have two living sets of grandparents, some confusion arises from calling two people \"grandma\" or \"grandpa\", so often two of the other terms listed above are used for one set of grandparents. Another common solution is to call grandparents by their first names (\"Grandpa George\", \"Grandma Anne\", etc.) or by their family names (\"Grandpa Jones\", \"Grandma Smith\"). In North America, many families call one set of grandparents by their ethnic names (e.g., [[Hispanic]] grandparents might be called ''abuelo'' and ''abuela'' or \"abuelito\" and \"abuelita\", [[French people|French]] grandparents might be called ''papi'' and ''mamie'', [[Italian people|Italian]] grandparents might be called ''nonno'' and ''nonna'', or [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[German people|German]] grandparents might be called ''Opa'' and ''Oma''. In [[Flanders]] pepee or petje and memee or metje are most used). In [[Friesland]], a common pair is pake and beppe. [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking [[Chinese people|Chinese]] Americans refer to maternal grandparents as ''w\u00e0i p\u00f3'' (\u5916\u5a46) and ''w\u00e0i g\u014dng'' (\u5916\u516c) and paternal grandparents as ''n\u01cei nai'' (\u5976\u5976) and ''y\u00e9 y\u00e9'' (\u7237\u7237). In the [[Philippines]], grandparents are called ''lolo'' (grandfather) and ''lola'' (grandmother), respectively.\n\nLanguages and cultures with more specific [[kinship terminology]] than English may distinguish between paternal grandparents and maternal grandparents. For example, in the [[Swedish language]] there is no single word for \"grandmother\"; the mother's mother is termed ''mormor'' and the father's mother is termed ''farmor''.<ref>{{citation |title=Child language, an international perspective: selected papers from the First International Congress for the Study of Child Language |volume=1 |editor-first=Philip S. |editor-last=Dale |editor-link=Philip S.

One's great-grandparent's parents would be \"great-great-grandparents\".\n\nTo avoid a proliferation of \"greats\" when discussing genealogical trees, one may also use [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinals]] instead of multiple \"greats\"; thus a \"great-great-grandfather\" would be the \"second great-grandfather\", and a \"great-great-great-grandfather\" would be a third great-grandfather, and so on. This system is used by some genealogical websites such as Geni.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geni.com |title=Family Tree & Family History at |publisher=Geni.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}</ref> One may also use [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]] for numbering greats, for example, great-great-great-grandmother becomes 3\u00d7-great-grandmother.\n\nIndividuals who share the same great-grandparents but are not siblings or [[Cousin#First cousins|first cousins]] are called \"second cousins\" to each other, as second cousins have grandparents who are siblings.

First, life expectancy has increased while fertility rates have decreased. This means that more children are growing up while their grandparents are still alive, whom can become involved in childcare.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, the reduced fertility rates mean that grandparents can devote more attention and resources to their only grandchildren.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Grandparenting: Changing Family Relationships in Global Contexts|last=Arber|first=Sara|last2=Timonen|first2=Virpi|publisher=The Policy Press|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Arber|editor-first=Sara|location=Great Britain|pages=247\u2013264|chapter=Grandparenting in the 21st century: New directions|editor-last2=Timonen|editor-first2=Virpi}}</ref> Second, more mothers are involved in the workforce, and thus, other caregivers need to be present to care for the child.<ref name=\":0\" /> For instance, in Hong Kong, 55% of grandparents reported that they took care of their grandchild because his or her parents have to work.<ref name=\":2\" /> In South Korea, 53% of working mother reported that they once received child care services from their parents.<ref name=\"Kim 1\u201313\"/> Third, the increasing number of single-parent families creates a need for grandparental support.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lam|first=TianYuan|last2=Lam|first2=Chun Bun|last3=Chan|first3=Kevin Ka-Shing|date=2017|title=Grandparental involvement and young adults' cognitive and social adjustment: The moderating role of filial piety in Hong Kong|url=|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|volume=35|issue=7|pages=999\u20131018|via=|doi=10.1177/0265407517702011}}</ref>\n\nThe degree of grandparent involvement also varies depending on the societal context, such as the social welfare policies. For example, in European countries such as Sweden and Denmark, where formal childcare is widely available, grandparents provide less intensive childcare.<ref name=\":1\" /> By contrast, in European countries such as Spain and Italy, where formal childcare is limited, and welfare payment is low, grandparents provide more intensive childcare.<ref name=\":1\" /> In Singapore, the grandparent caregiver tax relief was established in 2004, which enables working parents (Singapore citizens with children age 12 and below) whose children are being cared for by unemployed grandparents to receive income tax relief of 3,000 Singaporean dollars.<ref name=\"Thang 548\u2013570\"/>\n\n== Different types of grandparental involvement ==\nThere are different types of grandparental involvement, including nonresident grandparents, co-resident grandparents, grandparent-maintained household, and custodial grandparents.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Dunifon|first=Rachel|date=2012|title=The influence of grandparents on the lives of children and adolescents|url=|journal=Child Development Perspectives|volume=7|pages=55\u201360|doi=10.1111/cdep.12016|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Margaret|first=Platt Jendrek|date=1994|title=Grandparents who parent their grandchildren: circumstances and decisions|journal=The Gerontologist|volume=34|issue=2|pages=206\u2013216|doi=10.1093/geront/34.2.206}}</ref> \n* Nonresident grandparents: Grandparents who do not live with their grandchildren, but provide care for them,<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> such as picking them up from school.\n* Co-resident grandparents: Grandparents who live with their grandchild, as well as his/her parents.

Even when this is not the case, and particularly in traditional cultures, grandparents often have a direct and clear role in relation to the raising, care and [[nurture]] of [[child]]ren. Grandparents are second-degree relatives and share 25% genetic overlap.\n\nA step-grandparent can be the step-parent of the parent or the step-parent's parent or the step-parent's step-parent (though technically this might be called a step-step-grandparent). The various words for grandparents at times may also be used to refer to any elderly person, especially the terms ''gramps'', ''granny'', ''grandfather'', ''grandmother'', ''nan'', ''maw-maw'', ''paw-paw'' and others which families make up themselves.\n\n==Titles==\n[[File:GrandfatherAndScooter.JPG|275px|thumb|left|A grandfather teaching his granddaughter to use a [[kick scooter]]]]\nWhen used as a noun (e.g., \"... a grandparent walked by\"), grandfather and grandmother are usually used, although forms such as grandma/grandpa, granny/granddaddy or even nan/pop are sometimes used. When preceded by \"my ...\" (e.g., \"... my grandpa walked by\"), all forms are common (anywhere from \"... my grandfather ...\" to \"... my Gramps ...\"). All forms can be used in plural, but Gramps ([[plural]] Gramps<!--not Grampses-->) is rare.\n\nIn writing, ''Grandfather'' and ''Grandmother'' are most common, but very rare as a form of address. In speech, ''Grandpa'' and ''Grandma'' are commonly used in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and, particularly prevalent in the Canadian province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], ''Nan'', ''Nana'', ''Nanna'', ''Nanny'', ''Gran'' and ''Granny'' and other variations are often used for grandmother in both writing and speech.\n\nIn many parts of [[India]], maternal grandparents are called ''Nana'' and ''Nani''. Similarly, paternal grandparents are called ''Dada'' and ''Dadi''. \nOne's parents' maternal grandparents are called ''Par-nani'' and ''Par-nana''. On similar lines, parents' paternal grandparents are called ''Par-dadi'' and ''Par-dada.''\n \n[[File:Child pushing grandmother on plastic tricycle.jpg|thumb|A grandmother playing with her grandson]]\nNumerous other variants exist, such as ''Gramp'', ''Gramps'', ''Grampa'', ''Grandpap'', ''Granda'', ''Grampy'', ''Granddad'', ''Grandad'', ''Granddaddy'', ''Grandpappy'', ''Pop(s)'',  ''Pap,'' ''Pappy'', and ''Pawpaw'' for grandfather; ''Grandmom'', ''Grandmama'', ''Grama'', ''Granny'', ''Gran'', ''Nanny'', ''Nan'', ''Mammaw, Meemaw'' and ''Grammy'' for grandmother. ''Gogo'' can be used for either, etc.<!--do not add names \u2014 this is sufficient-->\n\nGiven that people may have two living sets of grandparents, some confusion arises from calling two people \"grandma\" or \"grandpa\", so often two of the other terms listed above are used for one set of grandparents. Another common solution is to call grandparents by their first names (\"Grandpa George\", \"Grandma Anne\", etc.) or by their family names (\"Grandpa Jones\", \"Grandma Smith\"). In North America, many families call one set of grandparents by their ethnic names (e.g., [[Hispanic]] grandparents might be called ''abuelo'' and ''abuela'' or \"abuelito\" and \"abuelita\", [[French people|French]] grandparents might be called ''papi'' and ''mamie'', [[Italian people|Italian]] grandparents might be called ''nonno'' and ''nonna'', or [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[German people|German]] grandparents might be called ''Opa'' and ''Oma''. In [[Flanders]] pepee or petje and memee or metje are most used). In [[Friesland]], a common pair is pake and beppe. [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking [[Chinese people|Chinese]] Americans refer to maternal grandparents as ''w\u00e0i p\u00f3'' (\u5916\u5a46) and ''w\u00e0i g\u014dng'' (\u5916\u516c) and paternal grandparents as ''n\u01cei nai'' (\u5976\u5976) and ''y\u00e9 y\u00e9'' (\u7237\u7237). In the [[Philippines]], grandparents are called ''lolo'' (grandfather) and ''lola'' (grandmother), respectively.\n\nLanguages and cultures with more specific [[kinship terminology]] than English may distinguish between paternal grandparents and maternal grandparents. For example, in the [[Swedish language]] there is no single word for \"grandmother\"; the mother's mother is termed ''mormor'' and the father's mother is termed ''farmor''.<ref>{{citation |title=Child language, an international perspective: selected papers from the First International Congress for the Study of Child Language |volume=1 |editor-first=Philip S. |editor-last=Dale |editor-link=Philip S.

One's great-grandparent's parents would be \"great-great-grandparents\".\n\nTo avoid a proliferation of \"greats\" when discussing genealogical trees, one may also use [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinals]] instead of multiple \"greats\"; thus a \"great-great-grandfather\" would be the \"second great-grandfather\", and a \"great-great-great-grandfather\" would be a third great-grandfather, and so on.

First, life expectancy has increased while fertility rates have decreased. This means that more children are growing up while their grandparents are still alive, whom can become involved in childcare.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, the reduced fertility rates mean that grandparents can devote more attention and resources to their only grandchildren.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Grandparenting: Changing Family Relationships in Global Contexts|last=Arber|first=Sara|last2=Timonen|first2=Virpi|publisher=The Policy Press|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Arber|editor-first=Sara|location=Great Britain|pages=247\u2013264|chapter=Grandparenting in the 21st century: New directions|editor-last2=Timonen|editor-first2=Virpi}}</ref> Second, more mothers are involved in the workforce, and thus, other caregivers need to be present to care for the child.<ref name=\":0\" /> For instance, in Hong Kong, 55% of grandparents reported that they took care of their grandchild because his or her parents have to work.<ref name=\":2\" /> In South Korea, 53% of working mother reported that they once received child care services from their parents.<ref name=\"Kim 1\u201313\"/> Third, the increasing number of single-parent families creates a need for grandparental support.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lam|first=TianYuan|last2=Lam|first2=Chun Bun|last3=Chan|first3=Kevin Ka-Shing|date=2017|title=Grandparental involvement and young adults' cognitive and social adjustment: The moderating role of filial piety in Hong Kong|url=|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|volume=35|issue=7|pages=999\u20131018|via=|doi=10.1177/0265407517702011}}</ref>\n\nThe degree of grandparent involvement also varies depending on the societal context, such as the social welfare policies. For example, in European countries such as Sweden and Denmark, where formal childcare is widely available, grandparents provide less intensive childcare.<ref name=\":1\" /> By contrast, in European countries such as Spain and Italy, where formal childcare is limited, and welfare payment is low, grandparents provide more intensive childcare.<ref name=\":1\" /> In Singapore, the grandparent caregiver tax relief was established in 2004, which enables working parents (Singapore citizens with children age 12 and below) whose children are being cared for by unemployed grandparents to receive income tax relief of 3,000 Singaporean dollars.<ref name=\"Thang 548\u2013570\"/>\n\n== Different types of grandparental involvement ==\nThere are different types of grandparental involvement, including nonresident grandparents, co-resident grandparents, grandparent-maintained household, and custodial grandparents.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Dunifon|first=Rachel|date=2012|title=The influence of grandparents on the lives of children and adolescents|url=|journal=Child Development Perspectives|volume=7|pages=55\u201360|doi=10.1111/cdep.12016|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Margaret|first=Platt Jendrek|date=1994|title=Grandparents who parent their grandchildren: circumstances and decisions|journal=The Gerontologist|volume=34|issue=2|pages=206\u2013216|doi=10.1093/geront/34.2.206}}</ref> \n* Nonresident grandparents: Grandparents who do not live with their grandchildren, but provide care for them,<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> such as picking them up from school.\n* Co-resident grandparents: Grandparents who live with their grandchild, as well as his/her parents.

The film centers on [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]] as they travel across the country in an attempt to [[Sexual intercourse|score]].\n\nPrevious offers by MTV to create a film version of ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' were rejected by Judge, but he eventually accepted one in 1994. When the film went into production, Judge and the show's staff halted production on the series while Judge and [[Joe Stillman]] wrote the script. They conceived numerous plot ideas with Judge's being the one developed into a film. [[John Frizzell (composer)|John Frizzell]] composed the film's score.\n\n''Beavis and Butt-Head Do America'' was praised by critics and proved to be a major box office hit from its release on December 20, 1996 by [[Paramount Pictures]], grossing $63.1 million in the United States, becoming the biggest December box office opening in history until it was beaten the following year by ''[[Scream 2]]'' and subsequently one week later by ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. Although not the only time a feature film was based on an MTV cartoon, it was MTV's only theatrically released animated film.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]] wake up from a dream(about destroying a city as giants) and discover that someone has stolen their [[television]], and they set out to find it. After several failed attempts to get a TV, they come across a motel which offers one in every room. They meet Muddy Grimes, who thinks that the boys are the [[Contract killing|hitmen]] he has contacted. Muddy offers Beavis and Butt-Head $10,000 to \"[[Murder|do]]\" his wife, Dallas. Thinking that \"do\" refers to sex, Butt-Head convinces Beavis that both of them can \"score\" and get paid enough to buy a new TV. Muddy hands them a photo of Dallas with instructions on where to find her and drives them to the airport to catch a plane to [[Las Vegas]].\n\nAfter arriving in the casino, Beavis and Butt-Head are ushered to the room Muddy booked, which is located next to Dallas's. They [[Eavesdropping|eavesdrop]] on the opposite room but are caught by Dallas. Dallas offers them $20,000 to go back and \"do\" Muddy, which they refuse. When Beavis (who has removed his pants) and Butt-Head begin arguing over who will \"do\" Dallas first, she realizes that they have misunderstood what they have been hired for. While they are fist fighting, she plants a stolen [[Biological agent|biological weapon]] known as the \"X-5 Unit\" in Beavis's pants in order to get rid of it. She then gets them tickets on a tour bus en route to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]]. and instructs them that she will be waiting for them in the [[US Capitol]] and will let them \"do her\" there.\n\nThe stolen bioweapon attracts the attention of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms|ATF]], headed by Agent Flemming, who orders a [[body cavity search]] on everyone he encounters. Flemming becomes convinced that the duo are [[Criminal mastermind|criminal masterminds]] after they accidentally release the water behind the [[Hoover Dam]], cutting the power to Las Vegas. They are placed on the FBI's most wanted list. After a visit to the [[Grand Canyon]] and [[Yellowstone National Park]],  they fail return to the tour bus on time. Beavis and Butt-Head accidentally ride a busload of [[Nun|nuns]]; repulsed by the boys' actions, the nuns later abandon them at a gift shop in [[Petrified Forest National Park]]. They are then told Washington is about 2,000 miles away and begin to hike until they reach the [[desert]] where they meet two former [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] [[Road crew|roadies]] who are heavily implied to be their fathers, but part ways before they can make the connection.\n\nThe next day the boys begin to hike once more, but they soon collapse from [[dehydration]]. Beavis has a series of hallucinations(animated by [[Rob Zombie]]) after eating a [[Peyote|peyote cacti]] (thinking that there's water inside.) They are eventually found by Muddy, who plans to kill them after realizing they were not the hitmen he hired. However, after hearing that Dallas is going to meet up with the duo in Washington, Muddy decides to take them the rest of the way in his trunk to hunt her down. The boys escape by jumping onto the interstate, inadvertently causing a 400-car [[Multiple-vehicle collision|pileup]]. They casually walk past the scene and get back on the tour bus, stopping at the Capitol before finally reaching the [[White House]]. Before Dallas can meet with Beavis and Butt-Head to recover the bioweapon, she is confronted in the [[Multistorey car park|parking garage]] by Muddy. Dallas, however, seduces him and they briefly reconcile and have sex in his car. The ATF catches them on the act and faced with the possibility of a 60-year jail sentence. Dallas betrays Muddy by saying that he hid the bioweapon in Beavis's pants.\n\nThe ATF is dispatched to the White House due to Beavis and Butt-Head being there on the same day as a peace conference. Beavis consumes [[Caffeine|caffeine pills]], [[sugar]], and [[coffee]] while on the White House tour, transforming him into [[Cornholio]]. Cornholio wanders into the [[Oval Office]] and picks up the [[Moscow\u2013Washington hotline|red phone]], causing the military to go to [[DEFCON 4]]. Meanwhile, Butt-Head tries hitting on [[Chelsea Clinton]], but he gets thrown out of her bedroom window as well as detained and cavity searched by ATF officers. Beavis leaves the White House and goes to Mr. Anderson's [[Caravan (towed trailer)|trailer]], where Anderson catches him after catching him \"[[Masturbation|whacking off]]\" and throws him out. The ATF spots Beavis walking around the camper pants-less and confronts him, thinking he has the bioweapon on him. As the ATF is about to open fire, Anderson opens his camper door and throws out Beavis's pants. The pants are ripped open by the ATF, with the bioweapon flying out of them. The weapon lands safely in Butt-Head's hand, who then hands it to Flemming. Blame for the crime is ultimately pinned on Anderson and his wife, who are accused of trying to frame Beavis and Butt-Head, and arrested along with Dallas and Muddy. Flemming informs the boys that they are heroes and their adventure will remain [[Classified information|top secret]]. They meet President [[Bill Clinton]], who makes them honorary ATF agents. Beavis and Butt-Head return to Highland and find their TV in front of the motel.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|[[File:Demi Moore 2010 Time 100 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|none|[[Demi Moore]] voices Dallas Grimes]]\n|[[File:Bruce Willis by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|none|[[Bruce Willis]] voices Muddy Grimes]]\n|[[File:Mike Judge by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|none|Mike Judge, voice of Beavis and Butt-head for TV, returned to work on the film]]\n|}\n<!-- main cast only -->\n* [[Mike Judge]] as [[Beavis]], [[Butt-Head]],  [[List of Beavis and Butt-Head characters#Tom Anderson|Tom Anderson (Old Guy with Camper)]],  [[List of Beavis and Butt-Head characters#Mr. Van Driessen|Van Driessen (Hippie Teacher)]], and [[List of Beavis and Butt-Head characters#Highland High faculty and staff|Principal McVicker]]\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Muddy Grimes\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Dallas Grimes\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Old Woman On Plane and Bus\n* [[Robert Stack]] as Agent Flemming\n\n<!-- also starring voice cast in alpha order, closing credits -->\nOther voice actors include: Jacqueline Barba, [[Pamela Blair]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Kristofor Brown]], Tony Darling, [[John Doman]], Francis DuMaurier, [[Jim Flaherty]], Tim Guinee, Earl Hofert, [[Toby Huss]], [[Sam Johnson]], [[Richard Linklater]], Rosemary McNamara, Harsh Nayyar, [[Karen Phillips]], Dale Reeves, Mike Ruschak, and Gail Thomas\n\n[[Greg Kinnear]] had an uncredited role as ATF Agent Bork,<ref name=\"cinemablend\">https://www.cinemablend.com/dvds/Beavis-Butthead-Do-America-Special-Collector-Edition-1817.html</ref> [[David Letterman]] had a role as a [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] [[roadie]] and was credited under \"Earl Hofert\".<ref name=\"ifc\">https://www.ifc.com/2016/01/15-things-you-might-not-know-about-beavis-and-butt-head</ref>\n\n==Production==\nDevelopment for the film began in 1993 as part of a production deal with [[MTV]], [[David Geffen]], and [[Warner Bros.]] Geffen so believed in the potential of the ''Beavis and Butt-head'' TV series that he suggested creating a movie and record album based on the program. They originally conceived it as a live action movie, with ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' regulars [[David Spade]] and [[Adam Sandler]] in mind to play the title characters. After MTV's parent company [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] purchased [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1994, the studio became a partner in the film, replacing Warner's interest in the project and dropping the live action concept under pressure from ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' creator [[Mike Judge]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Geffen Camp Heh-Hehs All the Way to the Bank |date=January 17, 1997 |work=The Los Angeles Times |first=Claudia |last=Ellen |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-17/business/fi-19392_1_david-geffen}}</ref> Judge has stated production of the animated film was very [[ad hoc]] and had some difficulties with progressing due to most of the staff's television background. Beavis' hallucination sequence's design and animation was based on the works of [[Rob Zombie]]. The sequence's director was [[Chris Prynoski]]. <!-- This information is taken from the 2006 DVD release's end credits. -->\n\n===Deleted scene===\nWhen the film premiered on MTV on August 7, 1999, an additional [[deleted scene]] followed the airing: while visiting the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]], Beavis attempts to [[Defecation|use the restroom]], but cannot because of the lack of toilet paper in the stall. Coincidentally, Butt-head is angry because the urinals lack the automatic flushing mechanisms that had amazed him at [[Yellowstone National Park]]. After the rest of their tour group finishes looking at the encased [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], Beavis sneaks out, breaks the glass with the U.S. flag pole, and steals it to use as \"T.P. for his bunghole.\" While Archive guards rush to see what happened, Beavis cleans up, and exits the stall with a piece of the Declaration, containing [[John Hancock]]'s signature, stuck to his shoe. The scene does not appear on the DVD, although it is mentioned on the disc's commentary track. In the track, Judge noted that the scene did not [[test screening|test]] well.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Another alternate scene was done for when Butt-Head meets [[Chelsea Clinton]] in her bedroom, which showed her packing up to leave the White House. This alternate scene was created in the event [[Bill Clinton]] lost his [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 re-election bid]] to [[Bob Dole]]. However, by the spring of 1996, Judge ultimately decided to keep the original scene because he felt that it was looking as if Clinton was going to win his bid for re-election, and did so that November.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Beavis and Butt-Head Do America'' opened in North America on December 20, 1996, and earned $63.1 million at the US box office after opening at #1 with $20.1 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1996&wknd=51&p=.htm |title=Weekend Box Office Results for December 20-22, 1996 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> It had a $12 million production budget.<ref name=\"Budget\">{{cite news|title= Beavis and Butt-head Make Creator and Paramount Proud|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=December 24, 1996|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-24/entertainment/ca-12081_1_paramount-pictures|accessdate=November 8, 2010 |first=Elaine |last=Dutka}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film held a 72% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 53 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 6.18/10.

It contained more in the way of bonus features such as [[Audio commentary|audio commentaries]], Spanish language tracks, more trailers, \"Making of\" documentaries, and more. It lacks the deleted National Archives scene. In 2013, \"The Edition That Doesn't Suck\" was re-released on DVD exclusively by Warner Home Video, under a deal with Paramount.

The film used an earlier demo version, while the soundtrack itself contains a later, revised version.

2010|first=Kevin|last=Thomas}}</ref> Co-written and directed by series creator [[Mike Judge]], the film  stars the regular television cast of Judge with guest performances by [[Demi Moore]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Robert Stack]] and [[Cloris Leachman]]. The film centers on [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]] as they travel across the country in an attempt to [[Sexual intercourse|score]].\n\nPrevious offers by MTV to create a film version of ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' were rejected by Judge, but he eventually accepted one in 1994. When the film went into production, Judge and the show's staff halted production on the series while Judge and [[Joe Stillman]] wrote the script. They conceived numerous plot ideas with Judge's being the one developed into a film. [[John Frizzell (composer)|John Frizzell]] composed the film's score.\n\n''Beavis and Butt-Head Do America'' was praised by critics and proved to be a major box office hit from its release on December 20, 1996 by [[Paramount Pictures]], grossing $63.1 million in the United States, becoming the biggest December box office opening in history until it was beaten the following year by ''[[Scream 2]]'' and subsequently one week later by ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. Although not the only time a feature film was based on an MTV cartoon, it was MTV's only theatrically released animated film.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]] discover that someone has stolen their [[television]], and they set out to find it. After several failed attempts to get a TV, they come across a motel which offers one in every room. They meet Muddy Grimes, who thinks that the boys are the [[Contract killing|hitmen]] he has contacted. Muddy offers Beavis and Butt-Head $10,000 to \"[[Murder|do]]\" his wife, Dallas. Thinking that \"do\" refers to sex, Butt-Head convinces Beavis that both of them can \"score\" and get paid enough to buy a new TV. Muddy hands them a photo of Dallas with instructions on where to find her and drives them to the airport to catch a plane to [[Las Vegas]].\n\nAfter arriving in the casino, Beavis and Butt-Head are ushered to the room Muddy booked, which is located next to Dallas's. They [[Eavesdropping|eavesdrop]] on the opposite room but are caught by Dallas. Dallas offers them $20,000 to go back and \"do\" Muddy, which they refuse. When Beavis (who has removed his pants) and Butt-Head begin arguing over who will \"do\" Dallas first, she realizes that they have misunderstood what they have been hired for. While they are fist fighting, she plants a stolen [[Biological agent|biological weapon]] known as the \"X-5 Unit\" in Beavis's pants in order to get rid of it. She then gets them tickets on a tour bus en route to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]]. and instructs them that she will be waiting for them in the [[US Capitol]] and will let them \"do her\" there.\n\nThe stolen bioweapon attracts the attention of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms|ATF]], headed by Agent Flemming, who orders a [[body cavity search]] on everyone he encounters. Flemming becomes convinced that the duo are [[Criminal mastermind|criminal masterminds]] after they accidentally release the water behind the [[Hoover Dam]], cutting the power to Las Vegas. They are placed on the FBI's most wanted list. After a visit to the [[Grand Canyon]] and [[Yellowstone National Park]],  they fail return to the tour bus on time. Beavis and Butt-Head accidentally ride a busload of [[Nun|nuns]]; repulsed by the boys' actions, the nuns later abandon them at a gift shop in [[Petrified Forest National Park]]. They are then told Washington is about 2,000 miles away and begin to hike until they reach the [[desert]] where they meet two former [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] [[Road crew|roadies]] who are heavily implied to be their fathers, but part ways before they can make the connection.\n\nThe next day the boys begin to hike once more, but they soon collapse from [[dehydration]]. Beavis has a series of hallucinations(animated by [[Rob Zombie]]) after eating a [[Peyote|peyote cacti]] (thinking that there's water inside.) They are eventually found by Muddy, who plans to kill them after realizing they were not the hitmen he hired. However, after hearing that Dallas is going to meet up with the duo in Washington, Muddy decides to take them the rest of the way in his trunk to hunt her down. The boys escape by jumping onto the interstate, inadvertently causing a 400-car [[Multiple-vehicle collision|pileup]]. They casually walk past the scene and get back on the tour bus, stopping at the Capitol before finally reaching the [[White House]]. Before Dallas can meet with Beavis and Butt-Head to recover the bioweapon, she is confronted in the [[Multistorey car park|parking garage]] by Muddy. Dallas, however, seduces him and they briefly reconcile and have sex in his car. The ATF catches them on the act and faced with the possibility of a 60-year jail sentence. Dallas betrays Muddy by saying that he hid the bioweapon in Beavis's pants.\n\nThe ATF is dispatched to the White House due to Beavis and Butt-Head being there on the same day as a peace conference. Beavis consumes [[Caffeine|caffeine pills]], [[sugar]], and [[coffee]] while on the White House tour, transforming him into [[Cornholio]]. Cornholio wanders into the [[Oval Office]] and picks up the [[Moscow\u2013Washington hotline|red phone]], causing the military to go to [[DEFCON 4]]. Meanwhile, Butt-Head tries hitting on [[Chelsea Clinton]], but he gets thrown out of her bedroom window as well as detained and cavity searched by ATF officers. Beavis leaves the White House and goes to Mr. Anderson's [[Caravan (towed trailer)|trailer]], where Anderson catches him after catching him \"[[Masturbation|whacking off]]\" and throws him out. The ATF spots Beavis walking around the camper pants-less and confronts him, thinking he has the bioweapon on him. As the ATF is about to open fire, Anderson opens his camper door and throws out Beavis's pants. The pants are ripped open by the ATF, with the bioweapon flying out of them. The weapon lands safely in Butt-Head's hand, who then hands it to Flemming. Blame for the crime is ultimately pinned on Anderson and his wife, who are accused of trying to frame Beavis and Butt-Head, and arrested along with Dallas and Muddy. Flemming informs the boys that they are heroes and their adventure will remain [[Classified information|top secret]]. They meet President [[Bill Clinton]], who makes them honorary ATF agents. Beavis and Butt-Head return to Highland and find their TV in front of the motel.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|[[File:Demi Moore 2010 Time 100 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|none|[[Demi Moore]] voices Dallas Grimes]]\n|[[File:Bruce Willis by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|none|[[Bruce Willis]] voices Muddy Grimes]]\n|[[File:Mike Judge by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|none|Mike Judge, voice of Beavis and Butt-head for TV, returned to work on the film]]\n|}\n<!-- main cast only -->\n* [[Mike Judge]] as [[Beavis]], [[Butt-Head]],  [[List of Beavis and Butt-Head characters#Tom Anderson|Tom Anderson (Old Guy with Camper)]],  [[List of Beavis and Butt-Head characters#Mr. Van Driessen|Van Driessen (Hippie Teacher)]], and [[List of Beavis and Butt-Head characters#Highland High faculty and staff|Principal McVicker]]\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Muddy Grimes\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Dallas Grimes\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Old Woman On Plane and Bus\n* [[Robert Stack]] as Agent Flemming\n\n<!-- also starring voice cast in alpha order, closing credits -->\nOther voice actors include: Jacqueline Barba, [[Pamela Blair]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Kristofor Brown]], Tony Darling, [[John Doman]], Francis DuMaurier, [[Jim Flaherty]], Tim Guinee, Earl Hofert, [[Toby Huss]], [[Sam Johnson]], [[Richard Linklater]], Rosemary McNamara, Harsh Nayyar, [[Karen Phillips]], Dale Reeves, Mike Ruschak, and Gail Thomas\n\n[[Greg Kinnear]] had an uncredited role as ATF Agent Bork,<ref name=\"cinemablend\">https://www.cinemablend.com/dvds/Beavis-Butthead-Do-America-Special-Collector-Edition-1817.html</ref> [[David Letterman]] had a role as a [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] [[roadie]] and was credited under \"Earl Hofert\".<ref name=\"ifc\">https://www.ifc.com/2016/01/15-things-you-might-not-know-about-beavis-and-butt-head</ref>\n\n==Production==\nDevelopment for the film began in 1993 as part of a production deal with [[MTV]], [[David Geffen]], and [[Warner Bros.]] Geffen so believed in the potential of the ''Beavis and Butt-head'' TV series that he suggested creating a movie and record album based on the program. They originally conceived it as a live action movie, with ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' regulars [[David Spade]] and [[Adam Sandler]] in mind to play the title characters. After MTV's parent company [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] purchased [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1994, the studio became a partner in the film, replacing Warner's interest in the project and dropping the live action concept under pressure from ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' creator [[Mike Judge]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Geffen Camp Heh-Hehs All the Way to the Bank |date=January 17, 1997 |work=The Los Angeles Times |first=Claudia |last=Ellen |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-17/business/fi-19392_1_david-geffen}}</ref> Judge has stated production of the animated film was very [[ad hoc]] and had some difficulties with progressing due to most of the staff's television background. Beavis' hallucination sequence's design and animation was based on the works of [[Rob Zombie]]. The sequence's director was [[Chris Prynoski]]. <!-- This information is taken from the 2006 DVD release's end credits. -->\n\n===Deleted scene===\nWhen the film premiered on MTV on August 7, 1999, an additional [[deleted scene]] followed the airing: while visiting the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]], Beavis attempts to [[Defecation|use the restroom]], but cannot because of the lack of toilet paper in the stall. Coincidentally, Butt-head is angry because the urinals lack the automatic flushing mechanisms that had amazed him at [[Yellowstone National Park]]. After the rest of their tour group finishes looking at the encased [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], Beavis sneaks out, breaks the glass with the U.S. flag pole, and steals it to use as \"T.P. for his bunghole.\" While Archive guards rush to see what happened, Beavis cleans up, and exits the stall with a piece of the Declaration, containing [[John Hancock]]'s signature, stuck to his shoe. The scene does not appear on the DVD, although it is mentioned on the disc's commentary track. In the track, Judge noted that the scene did not [[test screening|test]] well.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Another alternate scene was done for when Butt-Head meets [[Chelsea Clinton]] in her bedroom, which showed her packing up to leave the White House. This alternate scene was created in the event [[Bill Clinton]] lost his [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 re-election bid]] to [[Bob Dole]]. However, by the spring of 1996, Judge ultimately decided to keep the original scene because he felt that it was looking as if Clinton was going to win his bid for re-election, and did so that November.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Beavis and Butt-Head Do America'' opened in North America on December 20, 1996, and earned $63.1 million at the US box office after opening at #1 with $20.1 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1996&wknd=51&p=.htm |title=Weekend Box Office Results for December 20-22, 1996 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> It had a $12 million production budget.<ref name=\"Budget\">{{cite news|title= Beavis and Butt-head Make Creator and Paramount Proud|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=December 24, 1996|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-24/entertainment/ca-12081_1_paramount-pictures|accessdate=November 8, 2010 |first=Elaine |last=Dutka}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film held a 72% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 53 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 6.18/10.

It contained more in the way of bonus features such as [[Audio commentary|audio commentaries]], Spanish language tracks, more trailers, \"Making of\" documentaries, and more. It lacks the deleted National Archives scene. In 2013, \"The Edition That Doesn't Suck\" was re-released on DVD exclusively by Warner Home Video, under a deal with Paramount.
