However, it requires less support circuitry, allowing simpler and less expensive [[microcomputer]] systems to be built.\n\nThe \"5\" in the part number highlighted the fact that the 8085 uses a single +5-[[volt]] (V) power supply by using [[Depletion-load NMOS logic|depletion-mode]] transistors, rather than requiring the +5&nbsp;V, \u22125&nbsp;V and +12&nbsp;V supplies needed by the 8080. This capability matched that of the competing [[Zilog Z80|Z80]], a popular 8080-derived CPU introduced the year before. These processors could be used in computers running the [[CP/M operating system]].\n\nThe 8085 is supplied in a 40-pin [[Dual in-line package|DIP]] package. To maximise the functions on the available pins, the 8085 uses a multiplexed address/data(AD^0-AD^7) bus. However, an 8085 circuit requires an 8-bit address latch, so Intel manufactured several support chips with an address latch built in. These include the 8755, with an address latch, 2 KB of EPROM and 16 I/O pins, and the 8155 with 256 bytes of RAM, 22 I/O pins and a 14-bit programmable timer/counter. The multiplexed address/data bus reduced the number of PCB tracks between the 8085 and such memory and I/O chips.\n\nBoth the 8080 and the 8085 were eclipsed by the [[Zilog Z80]] for desktop computers, which took over most of the CP/M computer market, as well as a share of the booming [[home computer|home-computer]] market in the early-to-mid-1980s.\n\nThe 8085 had a long life as a controller, no doubt thanks to its built-in serial I/O and 5 prioritized interrupts, arguably microcontroller-like features that the Z80 CPU did not have. Once designed into such products as the [[DECtape#DECtape II|DECtape II]] controller and the [[VT102]] video terminal in the late 1970s, the 8085 served for new production throughout the lifetime of those products. This was typically longer than the product life of desktop computers.\n[[Image:Intel 8085A Die CPU Image.jpg|right|thumb|Intel 8085A CPU die]]\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Intel 8085 arch.svg|right|thumb|i8085 microarchitecture.]]\n[[File:Anschlussbelegung 8085.gif|right|thumb|i8085 pinout.]]\nThe 8085 is a conventional [[Von Neumann architecture|von Neumann]] design based on the Intel 8080. Unlike the 8080 it does not multiplex state signals onto the data bus, but the 8-bit [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] is instead multiplexed with the lower 8-bits of the 16-bit [[address bus]] to limit the number of pins to 40. State signals are provided by dedicated bus control signal pins and two dedicated bus state ID pins named S0 and S1.  Pin 40 is used for the power supply (+5&nbsp;V) and pin 20 for ground. Pin 39 is used as the Hold pin.  The processor was designed using [[NMOS logic|nMOS]] circuitry, and the later \"H\" versions were implemented in Intel's enhanced nMOS process called HMOS (\"High-performance MOS\"), originally developed for fast static RAM products. Only a single 5 volt power supply is needed, like competing processors and unlike the 8080. The 8085 uses approximately 6,500 [[transistor]]s.<ref>The history of the microcomputer-invention and evolution, S Mazor - Proceedings of the IEEE, 1995</ref>\n\nThe 8085 incorporates the functions of the 8224 (clock generator) and the 8228 (system controller) on chip, increasing the level of integration. A downside compared to similar contemporary designs (such as the Z80) is the fact that the buses require demultiplexing; however, address latches in the Intel 8155, 8355, and 8755 memory chips allow a direct interface, so an 8085 along with these chips is almost a complete system.\n\nThe 8085 has extensions to support new interrupts, with three maskable vectored interrupts (RST 7.5, RST 6.5 and RST 5.5), one [[non-maskable interrupt]] (TRAP), and one externally serviced interrupt (INTR). Each of these five interrupts has a separate pin on the processor, a feature which permits simple systems to avoid the cost of a separate interrupt controller. The RST 7.5 interrupt is edge triggered (latched), while RST 5.5 and 6.5 are level-sensitive. All interrupts are enabled by the EI instruction and disabled by the DI instruction.  In addition, the SIM (Set Interrupt Mask) and RIM (Read Interrupt Mask) instructions, the only instructions of the 8085 that are not from the 8080 design, allow each of the three maskable RST interrupts to be individually masked.  All three are masked after a normal CPU reset. SIM and RIM also allow the global interrupt mask state and the three independent RST interrupt mask states to be read, the pending-interrupt states of those same three interrupts to be read, the RST 7.5 trigger-latch flip-flop to be reset (cancelling the pending interrupt without servicing it), and serial data to be sent and received via the SOD and SID pins, respectively, all under program control and independently of each other.\n\nSIM and RIM each execute in 4 clock cycles (T states), making it possible to sample SID and/or toggle SOD considerably faster than it is possible to toggle or sample a signal via any I/O or memory-mapped port, e.g. one of the port of an 8155.  (In this way, SID can be compared to the SO [\"Set Overflow\"] pin of the 6502 CPU contemporary to the 8085.)\n\nLike the 8080, the 8085 can accommodate slower memories through externally generated [[wait state]]s (pin 35, READY), and has provisions for [[Direct Memory Access]] (DMA) using HOLD and HLDA signals (pins 39 and 38). An improvement over the 8080 is that the 8085 can itself drive a [[piezoelectric crystal]] directly connected to it, and a built-in clock generator generates the internal high amplitude [[two-phase clock]] signals at half the crystal frequency (a 6.14&nbsp;MHz crystal would yield a 3.07&nbsp;MHz clock, for instance). The internal clock is available on an output pin, to drive peripheral devices or other CPUs in lock-step synchrony with the CPU from which the signal is output.  The 8085 can also be clocked by an external oscillator (making it feasible to use the 8085 in synchronous multi-processor systems using a system-wide common clock for all CPUs, or to synchronize the CPU to an external time reference such as that from a video source or a high-precision time reference).\n\nThe 8085 is a [[binary compatible]] follow up on the 8080. It supports the complete [[instruction set]] of the 8080, with exactly the same instruction behavior, including all effects on the CPU flags (except for the AND/ANI operation, which sets the AC flag differently).<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/components/intel/MCS80/MCS80_85_Users_Manual_Jan83.pdf|title=The MCS-80/85 Family User's Manual|date=January 1983|publisher=[[Intel]]|at=page 1-8|quote=The 8085A CPU is 100% software compatible with the Intel 8080A CPU.}}</ref> This means that the vast majority of object code (any program image in ROM or RAM) that runs successfully on the 8080 can run directly on the 8085 without translation or modification. (Exceptions include timing-critical code and code that is sensitive to the aforementioned difference in the AC flag setting or differences in undocumented CPU behavior.) 8085 instruction timings differ slightly from the 8080\u2014some 8-bit operations, including INR, DCR, and the heavily used MOV r,r' instruction, are 1 clock cycle faster, but instructions that involve 16-bit operations, including stack operations (which increment or decrement the 16-bit SP register) generally 1 cycle slower.\nIt is of course possible that the actual 8080 and/or 8085 differs from the published specifications, especially in subtle details. (The same is not true of the Z80.) As mentioned already, only the SIM and RIM instructions were new to the 8085.<ref group=\"nb\">Note that the Z80 assigns different instructions\u2014two of the Z80's 6 relative jumps\u2014to the opcodes that the 8085 uses for RIM and SIM, making 8085 programs that use these instructions generally unable to run on the Z80 without modification.  Since use of these instructions usually relates to 8085-specific hardware features, the necessary program modification would typically be nontrivial.</ref>\n\n===Programming model===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:88%\"\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |''Intel 8085 registers''\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|- \n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>5</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>4</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>3</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>0</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>9</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>8</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>7</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>6</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>5</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>4</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>3</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>2</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>1</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>0</sub>\n| style=\"width:auto;\" | ''(bit position)''\n|- \n|colspan=\"17\" | '''Main registers'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| A\n| style=\"text-align:center;background:#DDD\" colspan=\"8\"| Flags\n| style=\"width:auto; background:white; color:black;\"| '''P'''rogram '''S'''tatus '''W'''ord\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| B\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| C\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''B'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| D\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| E\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''D'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| H\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| L\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''H''' (indirect address)\n|- \n|colspan=\"17\" | '''Index registers'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"16\"| SP\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''S'''tack '''P'''ointer\n|- \n|colspan=\"17\" | '''Program counter'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"16\"| PC\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''P'''rogram '''C'''ounter\n|- \n|colspan=\"17\" | '''Status register'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:white\" colspan=\"8\" | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Sign flag|S]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Zero flag|Z]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| -\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Half-carry flag|AC]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| -\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Parity flag|P]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| -\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Carry flag|CY]]\n| style=\"background:white; color:black\" | Flags\n|} \n|}\n\nThe processor has seven 8-bit [[processor register|registers]] accessible to the programmer, named A, B, C, D, E, H, and L, where A is also known as the accumulator. The other six registers can be used as independent byte-registers or as three 16-bit register pairs, BC, DE, and HL (or B, D, H, as referred to in Intel documents), depending on the particular instruction. Some instructions use HL as a (limited) 16-bit accumulator. As in the 8080, the contents of the memory address pointed to by HL can be accessed as pseudo register M. It also has a 16-bit [[program counter]] and a 16-bit [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack pointer]] to memory (replacing the 8008's internal [[stack (data structure)|stack]]). Instructions such as PUSH PSW, POP PSW affect the Program Status Word (accumulator and flags). The accumulator stores the results of arithmetic and logical operations, and the flags register bits (sign, zero, auxiliary carry, parity, and carry flags) are set or cleared according to the results of these operations. The sign flag is set if the result has a negative sign (i.e. it is set if bit 7 of the accumulator is set). The auxiliary or half carry flag is set if a carry-over from bit 3 to bit 4 occurred. The parity flag is set according to the parity (odd or even) of the accumulator. The zero flag is set if the result of the operation was 0. Lastly, the carry flag is set if a carry-over from bit 7 of the accumulator (the MSB) occurred.\n\n===Commands/instructions===\nAs in many other 8-bit processors, all instructions are encoded in a single byte (including register-numbers, but excluding immediate data), for simplicity. Some of them are followed by one or two bytes of data, which can be an immediate operand, a memory address, or a port number. A NOP \"no operation\" instruction exists, but does not modify any of the registers or flags. Like larger processors, it has CALL and RET instructions for multi-level procedure calls and returns (which can be conditionally executed, like jumps) and instructions to save and restore any 16-bit register-pair on the machine stack. There are also eight one-byte call instructions (RST) for subroutines located at the fixed addresses 00h, 08h, 10h,...,38h. These are intended to be supplied by external hardware in order to invoke a corresponding interrupt-service routine, but are also often employed as fast system calls. One sophisticated instruction is XTHL, which is used for exchanging the register pair HL with the value stored at the address indicated by the stack pointer.\n\n====8-bit instructions====\nAll 2-operand 8-bit arithmetic and logical (ALU) operations work on the 8-bit [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulator]] (the A register). For two-operand 8-bit operations, the other operand can be either an immediate value, another 8-bit register, or a memory cell addressed by the 16-bit register pair HL. The only 8-bit ALU operations that can have a destination other than the accumulator are the unary incrementation or decrementation instructions, which can operate on any 8-bit register or on memory addressed by HL, as for two-operand 8-bit operations. Direct copying is supported between any two 8-bit registers and between any 8-bit register and a HL-addressed memory cell, using the MOV instruction. An immediate value can also be moved into any of the foregoing destinations, using the MVI instruction. Due to the regular encoding of the MOV instruction (using nearly a quarter of the entire opcode space) there are redundant codes to copy a register into itself (''MOV B,B'', for instance), which are of little use, except for delays.<ref group=\"nb\">Even so, there is no need for seven different effectively identical delay instructions, and they are also identical in effect and form to the NOP instruction, except that NOP conveniently has the opcode 00 hex.</ref> However, what would have been a copy from the HL-addressed cell into itself (i.e., ''MOV M,M'') instead encodes the [[HLT (x86 instruction)|HLT]] instruction, halting execution until an external reset or unmasked interrupt occurs.<ref group=\"nb\">(The TRAP interrupt, being an [[Non-maskable interrupt|NMI]], can always bring the 8085 out of the HALT state.)</ref> <!-- It would be better if HLT were only mentioned here as regards opcode assignment and was explained operationally in a separate section about machine-control instructions-->\n\n====16-bit operations====\nAlthough the 8085 is an 8-bit processor, it has some 16-bit operations. Any of the three 16-bit register pairs (BC, DE, HL or SP) can be loaded with an immediate 16-bit value (using LXI), incremented or decremented (using INX and DCX), or added to HL (using DAD). LHLD loads HL from directly addressed memory and SHLD stores HL likewise. The XCHG operation exchanges the values of HL and DE. Adding HL to itself performs a 16-bit arithmetical left shift with one instruction. The only 16 bit instruction that affects any flag is DAD (adding BC, DE, HL, or SP, to HL), which updates the carry flag to facilitate 24-bit or larger additions and left shifts. Adding the stack pointer to HL is useful for indexing variables in (recursive) stack frames. A stack frame can be allocated using DAD SP and SPHL, and a branch to a computed pointer can be done with PCHL. These abilities make it feasible to compile languages such as [[PL/M]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], or [[C (programming language)|C]] with 16-bit variables and produce 8085 machine code.\nSubtraction and bitwise logical operations on 16 bits is done in 8-bit steps. Operations that have to be implemented by program code (subroutine libraries) include comparisons of signed integers as well as multiplication and division.\n\n==== Undocumented instructions ====\nA number of undocumented instructions and flags were discovered by two software engineers, Wolfgang Dehnhardt and Villy M. Sorensen in the process of developing an 8085 assembler. These instructions use 16-bit operands and include indirect loading and storing of a word, a subtraction, a shift, a rotate, and offset operations.<ref>{{cite journal\n | first = Wolfgang\n | last = Dehnhardt\n | first2 = Villy\n | last2 = M.

This I/O mapping scheme is regarded as an advantage, as it frees up the processor's limited address space. The IN and OUT instructions are used to read and write I/O port data.  In an I/O bus cycle, the 8-bit I/O address is output by the CPU on both the lower and upper halves of the 16-bit address bus.\n\nMemory mapped I/O devices can also be accessed by using the LDA (load accumulator from a 16-bit address) and STA (store accumulator at a 16-bit address specified) instructions, or any other instructions that have memory operands.\n\n===Development system===\nIntel produced a series of development systems for the 8080 and 8085, known as the MDS-80 Microprocessor System. The original development system had an 8080 processor. Later 8085 and 8086 support was added including ICE ([[in-circuit emulator]]s). It is a large and heavy desktop box, about a 20\" cube (in the Intel corporate blue color) which includes a CPU, monitor, and a single 8-inch floppy disk drive. Later an external box was made available with two more floppy drives. It runs the [[ISIS (operating system)|ISIS]] operating system and can also operate an [[emulator]] pod and an external [[EPROM]] programmer. This unit uses the Multibus card cage which was intended just for the development system. A surprising number of spare card cages and processors were being sold, leading to the development of the Multibus as a separate product.\n\nThe later iPDS is a portable unit, about 8\" x 16\" x 20\", with a handle. It has a small green screen, a keyboard built into the top, a 5\u00bc inch floppy disk drive, and runs the ISIS-II operating system. It can also accept a second 8085 processor, allowing a limited form of multi-processor operation where both processors run simultaneously and independently. The screen and keyboard can be switched between them, allowing programs to be assembled on one processor (large programs took awhile) while files are edited in the other. It has a [[bubble memory]] option and various programming modules, including EPROM, and [[Intel 8048]] and [[Intel 8051|8051]] programming modules which are plugged into the side, replacing stand-alone device programmers. In addition to an 8080/8085 assembler, Intel produced a number of compilers including those for [[PL/M|PL/M-80]] and [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], and a set of tools for linking and statically locating programs to enable them to be burned into [[EPROM]]s and used in [[embedded system]]s.\n\nA lower cost SDK-85 System Design Kit board contains an 8085 CPU, an 8355 ROM containing a debugging monitor program, an 8155 RAM and 22 I/O ports, an 8279 hex keypad and 8-digit 7-segment LED, and a TTY (Teletype) 20&nbsp;mA current loop serial interface. Pads are available for one more 2K\u00d78 8755 EPROM, and another 256&nbsp;byte RAM 8155 I/O Timer/Counter can be optionally added. All data, control, and address signals are available on dual pin headers, and a large prototyping area is provided.\n\n===List of Intel 8085===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model Number !!

However, it requires less support circuitry, allowing simpler and less expensive [[microcomputer]] systems to be built.\n\nThe \"5\" in the part number highlighted the fact that the 8085 uses a single +5-[[volt]] (V) power supply by using [[Depletion-load NMOS logic|depletion-mode]] transistors, rather than requiring the +5&nbsp;V, \u22125&nbsp;V and +12&nbsp;V supplies needed by the 8080. This capability matched that of the competing [[Zilog Z80|Z80]], a popular 8080-derived CPU introduced the year before. These processors could be used in computers running the [[CP/M operating system]].\n\nThe 8085 is supplied in a 40-pin [[Dual in-line package|DIP]] package. To maximise the functions on the available pins, the 8085 uses a multiplexed address/data(AD^0-AD^7) bus. However, an 8085 circuit requires an 8-bit address latch, so Intel manufactured several support chips with an address latch built in. These include the 8755, with an address latch, 2 KB of EPROM and 16 I/O pins, and the 8155 with 256 bytes of RAM, 22 I/O pins and a 14-bit programmable timer/counter. The multiplexed address/data bus reduced the number of PCB tracks between the 8085 and such memory and I/O chips.\n\nBoth the 8080 and the 8085 were eclipsed by the [[Zilog Z80]] for desktop computers, which took over most of the CP/M computer market, as well as a share of the booming [[home computer|home-computer]] market in the early-to-mid-1980s.\n\nThe 8085 had a long life as a controller, no doubt thanks to its built-in serial I/O and 5 prioritized interrupts, arguably microcontroller-like features that the Z80 CPU did not have. Once designed into such products as the [[DECtape#DECtape_II|DECtape II]] controller and the [[VT102]] video terminal in the late 1970s, the 8085 served for new production throughout the lifetime of those products. This was typically longer than the product life of desktop computers.\n[[Image:Intel 8085A Die CPU Image.jpg|right|thumb|Intel 8085A CPU die]]\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Intel 8085 arch.svg|right|thumb|i8085 microarchitecture.]]\n[[File:Anschlussbelegung 8085.gif|right|thumb|i8085 pinout.]]\nThe 8085 is a conventional [[Von Neumann architecture|von Neumann]] design based on the Intel 8080. Unlike the 8080 it does not multiplex state signals onto the data bus, but the 8-bit [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] is instead multiplexed with the lower 8-bits of the 16-bit [[address bus]] to limit the number of pins to 40. State signals are provided by dedicated bus control signal pins and two dedicated bus state ID pins named S0 and S1.  Pin 40 is used for the power supply (+5&nbsp;V) and pin 20 for ground. Pin 39 is used as the Hold pin.  The processor was designed using [[NMOS logic|nMOS]] circuitry, and the later \"H\" versions were implemented in Intel's enhanced nMOS process called HMOS (\"High-performance MOS\"), originally developed for fast static RAM products. Only a single 5 volt power supply is needed, like competing processors and unlike the 8080. The 8085 uses approximately 6,500 [[transistor]]s.<ref>The history of the microcomputer-invention and evolution, S Mazor - Proceedings of the IEEE, 1995</ref>\n\nThe 8085 incorporates the functions of the 8224 (clock generator) and the 8228 (system controller) on chip, increasing the level of integration. A downside compared to similar contemporary designs (such as the Z80) is the fact that the buses require demultiplexing; however, address latches in the Intel 8155, 8355, and 8755 memory chips allow a direct interface, so an 8085 along with these chips is almost a complete system.\n\nThe 8085 has extensions to support new interrupts, with three maskable vectored interrupts (RST 7.5, RST 6.5 and RST 5.5), one [[non-maskable interrupt]] (TRAP), and one externally serviced interrupt (INTR). Each of these five interrupts has a separate pin on the processor, a feature which permits simple systems to avoid the cost of a separate interrupt controller. The RST 7.5 interrupt is edge triggered (latched), while RST 5.5 and 6.5 are level-sensitive. All interrupts are enabled by the EI instruction and disabled by the DI instruction.  In addition, the SIM (Set Interrupt Mask) and RIM (Read Interrupt Mask) instructions, the only instructions of the 8085 that are not from the 8080 design, allow each of the three maskable RST interrupts to be individually masked.  All three are masked after a normal CPU reset. SIM and RIM also allow the global interrupt mask state and the three independent RST interrupt mask states to be read, the pending-interrupt states of those same three interrupts to be read, the RST 7.5 trigger-latch flip-flop to be reset (cancelling the pending interrupt without servicing it), and serial data to be sent and received via the SOD and SID pins, respectively, all under program control and independently of each other.\n\nSIM and RIM each execute in 4 clock cycles (T states), making it possible to sample SID and/or toggle SOD considerably faster than it is possible to toggle or sample a signal via any I/O or memory-mapped port, e.g. one of the port of an 8155.  (In this way, SID can be compared to the SO [\"Set Overflow\"] pin of the 6502 CPU contemporary to the 8085.)\n\nLike the 8080, the 8085 can accommodate slower memories through externally generated [[wait state]]s (pin 35, READY), and has provisions for [[Direct Memory Access]] (DMA) using HOLD and HLDA signals (pins 39 and 38). An improvement over the 8080 is that the 8085 can itself drive a [[piezoelectric crystal]] directly connected to it, and a built-in clock generator generates the internal high amplitude [[two-phase clock]] signals at half the crystal frequency (a 6.14&nbsp;MHz crystal would yield a 3.07&nbsp;MHz clock, for instance). The internal clock is available on an output pin, to drive peripheral devices or other CPUs in lock-step synchrony with the CPU from which the signal is output.  The 8085 can also be clocked by an external oscillator (making it feasible to use the 8085 in synchronous multi-processor systems using a system-wide common clock for all CPUs, or to synchronize the CPU to an external time reference such as that from a video source or a high-precision time reference).\n\nThe 8085 is a [[binary compatible]] follow up on the 8080. It supports the complete [[instruction set]] of the 8080, with exactly the same instruction behavior, including all effects on the CPU flags (except for the AND/ANI operation, which sets the AC flag differently).<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/components/intel/MCS80/MCS80_85_Users_Manual_Jan83.pdf|title=The MCS-80/85 Family User's Manual|date=January 1983|publisher=[[Intel]]|at=page 1-8|quote=The 8085A CPU is 100% software compatible with the Intel 8080A CPU.}}</ref> This means that the vast majority of object code (any program image in ROM or RAM) that runs successfully on the 8080 can run directly on the 8085 without translation or modification. (Exceptions include timing-critical code and code that is sensitive to the aforementioned difference in the AC flag setting or differences in undocumented CPU behavior.) 8085 instruction timings differ slightly from the 8080\u2014some 8-bit operations, including INR, DCR, and the heavily used MOV r,r' instruction, are 1 clock cycle faster, but instructions that involve 16-bit operations, including stack operations (which increment or decrement the 16-bit SP register) generally 1 cycle slower.\nIt is of course possible that the actual 8080 and/or 8085 differs from the published specifications, especially in subtle details. (The same is not true of the Z80.) As mentioned already, only the SIM and RIM instructions were new to the 8085.<ref group=\"nb\">Note that the Z80 assigns different instructions\u2014two of the Z80's 6 relative jumps\u2014to the opcodes that the 8085 uses for RIM and SIM, making 8085 programs that use these instructions generally unable to run on the Z80 without modification.  Since use of these instructions usually relates to 8085-specific hardware features, the necessary program modification would typically be nontrivial.</ref>\n\n===Programming model===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:88%\"\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |''Intel 8085 registers''\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|- \n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>5</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>4</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>3</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>0</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>9</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>8</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>7</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>6</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>5</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>4</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>3</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>2</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>1</sub>\n| style=\"width:10px; text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>0</sub>\n| style=\"width:auto;\" | ''(bit position)''\n|- \n|colspan=\"17\" | '''Main registers'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| A\n| style=\"text-align:center;background:#DDD\" colspan=\"8\"| Flags\n| style=\"width:auto; background:white; color:black;\"| '''P'''rogram '''S'''tatus '''W'''ord\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| B\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| C\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''B'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| D\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| E\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''D'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| H\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| L\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''H''' (indirect address)\n|- \n|colspan=\"17\" | '''Index registers'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"16\"| SP\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''S'''tack '''P'''ointer\n|- \n|colspan=\"17\" | '''Program counter'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"16\"| PC\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''P'''rogram '''C'''ounter\n|- \n|colspan=\"17\" | '''Status register'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:white\" colspan=\"8\" | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Sign flag|S]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Zero flag|Z]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| -\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Half-carry flag|AC]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| -\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Parity flag|P]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| -\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Carry flag|CY]]\n| style=\"background:white; color:black\" | Flags\n|} \n|}\n\nThe processor has seven 8-bit [[processor register|registers]] accessible to the programmer, named A, B, C, D, E, H, and L, where A is also known as the accumulator. The other six registers can be used as independent byte-registers or as three 16-bit register pairs, BC, DE, and HL (or B, D, H, as referred to in Intel documents), depending on the particular instruction. Some instructions use HL as a (limited) 16-bit accumulator. As in the 8080, the contents of the memory address pointed to by HL can be accessed as pseudo register M. It also has a 16-bit [[program counter]] and a 16-bit [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack pointer]] to memory (replacing the 8008's internal [[stack (data structure)|stack]]). Instructions such as PUSH PSW, POP PSW affect the Program Status Word (accumulator and flags). The accumulator stores the results of arithmetic and logical operations, and the flags register bits (sign, zero, auxiliary carry, parity, and carry flags) are set or cleared according to the results of these operations. The sign flag is set if the result has a negative sign (i.e. it is set if bit 7 of the accumulator is set). The auxiliary or half carry flag is set if a carry-over from bit 3 to bit 4 occurred. The parity flag is set according to the parity (odd or even) of the accumulator. The zero flag is set if the result of the operation was 0. Lastly, the carry flag is set if a carry-over from bit 7 of the accumulator (the MSB) occurred.\n\n===Commands/instructions===\nAs in many other 8-bit processors, all instructions are encoded in a single byte (including register-numbers, but excluding immediate data), for simplicity. Some of them are followed by one or two bytes of data, which can be an immediate operand, a memory address, or a port number. A NOP \"no operation\" instruction exists, but does not modify any of the registers or flags. Like larger processors, it has CALL and RET instructions for multi-level procedure calls and returns (which can be conditionally executed, like jumps) and instructions to save and restore any 16-bit register-pair on the machine stack. There are also eight one-byte call instructions (RST) for subroutines located at the fixed addresses 00h, 08h, 10h,...,38h. These are intended to be supplied by external hardware in order to invoke a corresponding interrupt-service routine, but are also often employed as fast system calls. One sophisticated instruction is XTHL, which is used for exchanging the register pair HL with the value stored at the address indicated by the stack pointer.\n\n====8-bit instructions====\nAll 2-operand 8-bit arithmetic and logical (ALU) operations work on the 8-bit [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulator]] (the A register). For two-operand 8-bit operations, the other operand can be either an immediate value, another 8-bit register, or a memory cell addressed by the 16-bit register pair HL. The only 8-bit ALU operations that can have a destination other than the accumulator are the unary incrementation or decrementation instructions, which can operate on any 8-bit register or on memory addressed by HL, as for two-operand 8-bit operations. Direct copying is supported between any two 8-bit registers and between any 8-bit register and a HL-addressed memory cell, using the MOV instruction. An immediate value can also be moved into any of the foregoing destinations, using the MVI instruction. Due to the regular encoding of the MOV instruction (using nearly a quarter of the entire opcode space) there are redundant codes to copy a register into itself (''MOV B,B'', for instance), which are of little use, except for delays.<ref group=\"nb\">Even so, there is no need for seven different effectively identical delay instructions, and they are also identical in effect and form to the NOP instruction, except that NOP conveniently has the opcode 00 hex.</ref> However, what would have been a copy from the HL-addressed cell into itself (i.e., ''MOV M,M'') instead encodes the [[HLT (x86 instruction)|HLT]] instruction, halting execution until an external reset or unmasked interrupt occurs.<ref group=\"nb\">(The TRAP interrupt, being an [[Non-maskable interrupt|NMI]], can always bring the 8085 out of the HALT state.)</ref> <!-- It would be better if HLT were only mentioned here as regards opcode assignment and was explained operationally in a separate section about machine-control instructions-->\n\n====16-bit operations====\nAlthough the 8085 is an 8-bit processor, it has some 16-bit operations. Any of the three 16-bit register pairs (BC, DE, HL or SP) can be loaded with an immediate 16-bit value (using LXI), incremented or decremented (using INX and DCX), or added to HL (using DAD). LHLD loads HL from directly addressed memory and SHLD stores HL likewise. The XCHG operation exchanges the values of HL and DE. Adding HL to itself performs a 16-bit arithmetical left shift with one instruction. The only 16 bit instruction that affects any flag is DAD (adding BC, DE, HL, or SP, to HL), which updates the carry flag to facilitate 24-bit or larger additions and left shifts. Adding the stack pointer to HL is useful for indexing variables in (recursive) stack frames. A stack frame can be allocated using DAD SP and SPHL, and a branch to a computed pointer can be done with PCHL. These abilities make it feasible to compile languages such as [[PL/M]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], or [[C (programming language)|C]] with 16-bit variables and produce 8085 machine code.\nSubtraction and bitwise logical operations on 16 bits is done in 8-bit steps. Operations that have to be implemented by program code (subroutine libraries) include comparisons of signed integers as well as multiplication and division.\n\n==== Undocumented instructions ====\nA number of undocumented instructions and flags were discovered by two software engineers, Wolfgang Dehnhardt and Villy M. Sorensen in the process of developing an 8085 assembler. These instructions use 16-bit operands and include indirect loading and storing of a word, a subtraction, a shift, a rotate, and offset operations.<ref>{{cite journal\n | first = Wolfgang\n | last = Dehnhardt\n | first2 = Villy\n | last2 = M.

This I/O mapping scheme is regarded as an advantage, as it frees up the processor's limited address space. The IN and OUT instructions are used to read and write I/O port data.  In an I/O bus cycle, the 8-bit I/O address is output by the CPU on both the lower and upper halves of the 16-bit address bus.\n\nMemory mapped I/O devices can also be accessed by using the LDA (load accumulator from a 16-bit address) and STA (store accumulator at a 16-bit address specified) instructions, or any other instructions that have memory operands.\n\n===Development system===\nIntel produced a series of development systems for the 8080 and 8085, known as the MDS-80 Microprocessor System. The original development system had an 8080 processor. Later 8085 and 8086 support was added including ICE ([[in-circuit emulator]]s). It is a large and heavy desktop box, about a 20\" cube (in the Intel corporate blue color) which includes a CPU, monitor, and a single 8-inch floppy disk drive. Later an external box was made available with two more floppy drives. It runs the [[ISIS (operating system)|ISIS]] operating system and can also operate an [[emulator]] pod and an external [[EPROM]] programmer. This unit uses the Multibus card cage which was intended just for the development system. A surprising number of spare card cages and processors were being sold, leading to the development of the Multibus as a separate product.\n\nThe later iPDS is a portable unit, about 8\" x 16\" x 20\", with a handle. It has a small green screen, a keyboard built into the top, a 5\u00bc inch floppy disk drive, and runs the ISIS-II operating system. It can also accept a second 8085 processor, allowing a limited form of multi-processor operation where both processors run simultaneously and independently. The screen and keyboard can be switched between them, allowing programs to be assembled on one processor (large programs took awhile) while files are edited in the other. It has a [[bubble memory]] option and various programming modules, including EPROM, and [[Intel 8048]] and [[Intel 8051|8051]] programming modules which are plugged into the side, replacing stand-alone device programmers. In addition to an 8080/8085 assembler, Intel produced a number of compilers including those for [[PL/M|PL/M-80]] and [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], and a set of tools for linking and statically locating programs to enable them to be burned into [[EPROM]]s and used in [[embedded system]]s.\n\nA lower cost SDK-85 System Design Kit board contains an 8085 CPU, an 8355 ROM containing a debugging monitor program, an 8155 RAM and 22 I/O ports, an 8279 hex keypad and 8-digit 7-segment LED, and a TTY (Teletype) 20&nbsp;mA current loop serial interface. Pads are available for one more 2K\u00d78 8755 EPROM, and another 256&nbsp;byte RAM 8155 I/O Timer/Counter can be optionally added. All data, control, and address signals are available on dual pin headers, and a large prototyping area is provided.\n\n===List of Intel 8085===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model Number !!

More complex operations and other arithmetic operations must be implemented in software. For example, multiplication is implemented using a [[multiplication algorithm]].\n\nThe 8085 processor was used in a few early personal computers, for example, the [[TRS-80 Model 100 line]] used an OKI manufactured 80C85 (MSM80C85ARS). The [[CMOS]] version 80C85 of the NMOS/HMOS 8085 processor has several manufacturers.

It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[RedOne]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Lyrically, ''Artpop'' revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions of the album in January 2019, and was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

The background consists of art works including ''The Birth of Venus'', which inspired the singer's music video for \"Applause\" and the VMA performance of the song. Koons explained the meaning of the cover to MTV:\n\n{{blockquote|\"With the cover, I wanted to have Gaga there as a sculpture, as a three-dimensional type of form and with the gazing ball, because the gazing ball really does become kind of the symbol for everything \u2014 and this aspect of reflection that when you come across something like a gazing ball, it affirms you, it affirms your existence and then from that affirmation, you start to want more. There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty. And of the desire to continually have transcendence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213155629/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|archivedate=February 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nWill Gompertz from ''[[NME]]'' wrote that \"this is a classic cover.

It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[RedOne]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Lyrically, ''Artpop'' revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions of the album in January 2019, and was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

While the album received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], it was commercially successful, debuting at number one on the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one record in the country. It also topped national [[record chart]]s in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in over 20. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Artpop'' was the ninth global best-selling album of 2013 with 2.3 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"IFPI 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2014|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=June 26, 2014|page=12}}</ref> The album sold 2.5 million units as of July 2014.

But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty. And of the desire to continually have transcendence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213155629/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|archivedate=February 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nWill Gompertz from ''[[NME]]'' wrote that \"this is a classic cover.

In 2001 it became '''Ashdown Technology College''' after being awarded specialist status in technology. The school converted to academy status on 1 September 2013 and was renamed Magna Academy.\n\n==History==\n===Construction and opening===\nThe construction of Ashdown School began in 1986 in a large field in [[Canford Heath]], [[Poole]], Dorset. The new secondary school would be the result of two closing schools, Seldown Boys School and Ashley Cross Girls School, fusing together. The name Ashdown is a combination of the school's names.\n\nDuring construction, a [[time capsule]] was placed somewhere within the brick walls, the capsule being removed from its previous location in Seldown Boys School. Fifty [[ash tree]]s were planted around the border of the school's field, to represent the school's new name. However, deliberately started fires have destroyed some of the trees, the most recently in 2003. A [[collage]] was made from drawings of the original two schools, that hangs in the entrance of the school.\n\nOn 7 July 1989, the new Ashdown School was opened by [[Princess Margaret]] and headteacher Mollie Snell. Six hundred students attended the opening of the school.\n\n===Events in 1990\u20131999===\nIn 1990, Snell retired from her post as headteacher and passed it on to Ashley Pellegrini, who was previously deputy headteacher of Mellow Lane Comprehensive School in Hayes, Middlesex. The school also celebrated its first [[Sports Day]] on the school's field and running track; this became a yearly tradition for the school. New ICT facilities were also opened.\n\nIn 1991, the school performed its first Christmas pantomime, \"The Magic Sword\". School shows eventually disappeared from the yearly events, as did Drama. The school previously had a newspaper named the ''Ashdown Echo'' (a parody of the ''Echo'' newspaper), but it eventually ceased. The first Year 11 Prom was held. The School Council was created, to help improve the school's conditions.\n\nIn 1995, the '''Charter Mark Award''' was given to Ashdown for Excellence in Public Service.\n\nOn 7 October, [1997], two arsonists set the school on fire at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. and burnt down part of the school, destroying the music room. The school was closed for a week as police, teachers and Site Manager along with Council staff examined damage to the school. A new area was constructed in 1999, with a new music room and five new classrooms that would become Maths rooms. The school received a second Charter Mark Award in 1998.\n\n===Events in 2000\u20132013===\nIn 2000, the school was presented a [[DfES]] School Improvement Award. In 2001, under the DfES; Specialist Schools programme, Ashdown became a Technology College and changed its name to Ashdown Technology College. New technology is added in several classrooms, including interactive whiteboards.\n\nIn 2005 Ashdown was recognised by the Specialist Schools Trust as one of the \"Most Improved\" and \"Best Added Value\" Schools in the country. The DfEs also designated Ashdown as a High Performing Specialist School. Near the end of the school term, In 2006 Ashdown was redesignated as a Technology College with Vocational Learning added to its specialisms. A Sixth Form was introduced. Headteacher Pellegrini was replaced in 2007 by Liz Jones. The new term that began in September 2007, introduced a new school uniform to the school, replacing the school sweatshirts with jumpers and a blue polo shirt both with the school logo on it. Also bringing in the new P.E uniform which is red polo top with school logo and shorts or tracksuit bottoms with school logo on it. Parts of the school were refurbished in 2008, including heavy reconstruction to Ashdown Gym.\n\nIn 2012 Ashdown Technology College was placed in [[special measures]] after [[Ofsted]] assessed the school as \"inadequate\" for overall effectiveness.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/9867931.Ashdown_Technology_College_in_Poole_rated__inadequate__by_Ofsted/ |title=Ashdown Technology College in Poole rated 'inadequate' by Ofsted |author=Diana Henderson |newspaper=Bournemouth Echo |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=telegraph-20150908/>\n\n===Renaming to Magna Academy===\nThe school officially transferred from Ashdown Technology College to Magna Academy on 1 September 2013.<ref>http://www.aatmagna.org/</ref>\n\nIn September 2015 the academy received national media attention after it removed pupils from classes for having miss-sized classroom equipment, such as too small pencil cases or rulers.<ref name=telegraph-20150908>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/11851082/Dorset-school-praised-by-David-Cameron-isolates-up-to-40-pupils-for-pencil-case-infingements.html |title=Dorset school praised by David Cameron 'isolates' up to 40 pupils for 'pencil case infringement' |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=8 September 2015 |accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Silent corridors controversy===\nAn Ofted inspection in December 2018 endorsed the school's controversial silent corridors policy. Pupils are expected to change classrooms in complete silence, thus arriving at their next lesson calm and ready to work. The principal is focussed on improving the results though improving behaviour, this is one method. His emphasis on behaviour has caused the school to have a higher than average exclusion rate. <ref name=ofsted>{{cite web |last1=Whittaker |first1=Freddie |title=Ofsted praises school with silent corridors and high exclusions |url=https://schoolsweek.co.uk/ofsted-praises-school-with-silent-corridors-and-high-exclusion-rate/ |website=Schools Week |accessdate=16 January 2019 |date=14 January 2019}}</ref>. [[Special educational needs and disability|SEND]] experts point out that schools have a duty to cater for a pupils individual need, and silent corridors in not an inclusive strategy; while a silent corridor may suit some pupils to others it would be might find this extremely stressful and disconcerting. <ref name=ofsted/>\n\nAccording to the Ofsted Report, Richard Tutt, principal of Magna Academy, said while silent corridors isn\u2019t the right thing for every school, it \u201cworks for us\u201d.\n\"Some of our students have come from schools where they had been subjected to verbal and physical aggression in transitions, and so they love it. We think it is appreciated by staff and students. It is in no way oppressive\". \n\u201cAs moving around school in silence does also happen in some primary schools, I really don\u2019t think it is much of an issue\u201d<ref name=ofsted/>\n\n== Present ==\n\n=== Under new management ===\nIn the summer of 2019, Richard Tutt left the Academy <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/17394775.magna-academys-richard-tutt-to-leave-poole-school-in-august/|title=Britain's 'strictest' head teacher to leave Magna Academy after winning promotion|website=Bournemouth Echo|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> to pursue a new role with a competitor Trust.

Ms Ullah joined the school from the [[The Thomas Hardye School|Thomas Hardye School]] in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]]. She is the first [[Bame|BAME]] headteacher to be appointed on England's South Coast.\n\n=== Coronavirus crisis ===\nIn the wake of the unfolding [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] [[pandemic]], Magna Academy was obliged to temporarily close its doors to students from 20 March, 2020.

In 2001 it became '''Ashdown Technology College''' after being awarded specialist status in technology. The school converted to academy status on 1 September 2013 and was renamed Magna Academy.\n\n==History==\n===Construction and opening===\nThe construction of Ashdown School began in 1986 in a large field in [[Canford Heath]], [[Poole]], Dorset. The new secondary school would be the result of two closing schools, Seldown Boys School and Ashley Cross Girls School, fusing together. The name Ashdown is a combination of the school's names.\n\nDuring construction, a [[time capsule]] was placed somewhere within the brick walls, the capsule being removed from its previous location in Seldown Boys School. Fifty [[ash tree]]s were planted around the border of the school's field, to represent the school's new name. However, deliberately started fires have destroyed some of the trees, the most recently in 2003. A [[collage]] was made from drawings of the original two schools, that hangs in the entrance of the school.\n\nOn 7 July 1989, the new Ashdown School was opened by [[Princess Margaret]] and headteacher Mollie Snell. Six hundred students attended the opening of the school.\n\n===Events in 1990\u20131999===\nIn 1990, Snell retired from her post as headteacher and passed it on to Ashley Pellegrini, who was previously deputy headteacher of Mellow Lane Comprehensive School in Hayes, Middlesex. The school also celebrated its first [[Sports Day]] on the school's field and running track; this became a yearly tradition for the school. New ICT facilities were also opened.\n\nIn 1991, the school performed its first Christmas pantomime, \"The Magic Sword\". School shows eventually disappeared from the yearly events, as did Drama. The school previously had a newspaper named the ''Ashdown Echo'' (a parody of the ''Echo'' newspaper), but it eventually ceased. The first Year 11 Prom was held. The School Council was created, to help improve the school's conditions.\n\nIn 1995, the '''Charter Mark Award''' was given to Ashdown for Excellence in Public Service.\n\nOn 7 October, [1997], two arsonists set the school on fire at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. and burnt down part of the school, destroying the music room. The school was closed for a week as police, teachers and Site Manager along with Council staff examined damage to the school. A new area was constructed in 1999, with a new music room and five new classrooms that would become Maths rooms. The school received a second Charter Mark Award in 1998.\n\n===Events in 2000\u20132013===\nIn 2000, the school was presented a [[DfES]] School Improvement Award. In 2001, under the DfES; Specialist Schools programme, Ashdown became a Technology College and changed its name to Ashdown Technology College. New technology is added in several classrooms, including interactive whiteboards.\n\nIn 2005 Ashdown was recognised by the Specialist Schools Trust as one of the \"Most Improved\" and \"Best Added Value\" Schools in the country. The DfEs also designated Ashdown as a High Performing Specialist School. Near the end of the school term, In 2006 Ashdown was redesignated as a Technology College with Vocational Learning added to its specialisms. A Sixth Form was introduced. Headteacher Pellegrini was replaced in 2007 by Liz Jones. The new term that began in September 2007, introduced a new school uniform to the school, replacing the school sweatshirts with jumpers and a blue polo shirt both with the school logo on it. Also bringing in the new P.E uniform which is red polo top with school logo and shorts or tracksuit bottoms with school logo on it. Parts of the school were refurbished in 2008, including heavy reconstruction to Ashdown Gym.\n\nIn 2012 Ashdown Technology College was placed in [[special measures]] after [[Ofsted]] assessed the school as \"inadequate\" for overall effectiveness.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/9867931.Ashdown_Technology_College_in_Poole_rated__inadequate__by_Ofsted/ |title=Ashdown Technology College in Poole rated 'inadequate' by Ofsted |author=Diana Henderson |newspaper=Bournemouth Echo |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=telegraph-20150908/>\n\n===Renaming to Magna Academy===\nThe school officially transferred from Ashdown Technology College to Magna Academy on 1 September 2013.<ref>http://www.aatmagna.org/</ref>\n\nIn September 2015 the academy received national media attention after it removed pupils from classes for having miss-sized classroom equipment, such as too small pencil cases or rulers.<ref name=telegraph-20150908>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/11851082/Dorset-school-praised-by-David-Cameron-isolates-up-to-40-pupils-for-pencil-case-infingements.html |title=Dorset school praised by David Cameron 'isolates' up to 40 pupils for 'pencil case infringement' |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=8 September 2015 |accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Silent corridors controversy===\nAn Ofted inspection in December 2018 endorsed the school's controversial silent corridors policy. Pupils are expected to change classrooms in complete silence, thus arriving at their next lesson calm and ready to work. The principal is focussed on improving the results though improving behaviour, this is one method. His emphasis on behaviour has caused the school to have a higher than average exclusion rate. <ref name=ofsted>{{cite web |last1=Whittaker |first1=Freddie |title=Ofsted praises school with silent corridors and high exclusions |url=https://schoolsweek.co.uk/ofsted-praises-school-with-silent-corridors-and-high-exclusion-rate/ |website=Schools Week |accessdate=16 January 2019 |date=14 January 2019}}</ref>. [[Special educational needs and disability|SEND]] experts point out that schools have a duty to cater for a pupils individual need, and silent corridors in not an inclusive strategy; while a silent corridor may suit some pupils to others it would be might find this extremely stressful and disconcerting. <ref name=ofsted/>\n\nAccording to the Ofsted Report, Richard Tutt, principal of Magna Academy, said while silent corridors isn\u2019t the right thing for every school, it \u201cworks for us\u201d.\n\"Some of our students have come from schools where they had been subjected to verbal and physical aggression in transitions, and so they love it. We think it is appreciated by staff and students. It is in no way oppressive\". \n\u201cAs moving around school in silence does also happen in some primary schools, I really don\u2019t think it is much of an issue\u201d<ref name=ofsted/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.aatmagna.org/ Magna Academy Poole]\n\n{{Schools in Dorset}}\n\n[[Category:Secondary schools in Poole]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1989]]\n[[Category:1989 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Academies in Poole]]\n", "name_user": "ZippyFromRainbow", "label": "safe", "comment": "Updated the transition to new headship and impact of Covid-19 closure.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Academy"}
