[[University of Manchester]]. After graduating, he worked in advertising for [[Procter & Gamble]], but in 1978 he moved to be legal adviser to the Northern Region of the [[GMB (trade union)|GMBATU]], based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. In 1980 he was elected to [[Newcastle City Council]], representing Walker ward. His role in the union gave him a role in maximising the union's influence in [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] selections.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Political career==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2019}}\nWhen [[Mike Thomas (politician)|Mike Thomas]], the sitting Labour [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Newcastle upon Tyne East (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle upon Tyne East]], defected to the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]], Brown was chosen as the new Labour Party candidate for the seat, easily retaining it for Labour at the 1983 general election. He joined Labour's front bench in 1985 as a spokesman on Legal Affairs; from 1988 he was a Treasury spokesman and from 1994 he shadowed Health.\n\nOriginally elected to the Commons in the same year as [[Gordon Brown]] and [[Tony Blair]] he was initially close to both men but over time he became his namesake Brown's staunchest ally, though the two are unrelated. In the [[1994 Labour Party leadership election|1994 Labour leadership election]] he acted as Brown's unofficial campaign manager, and according to [[Gordon Brown]]'s biographer [[Paul Routledge]], advised against him pulling out of the contest in Blair's favour.\n\nIn 1995, he was appointed Deputy Chief Whip and played a central role in the close Parliament in trying to defeat the Conservatives. After Labour's [[1997 United Kingdom general election|election]] victory in 1997, he was appointed [[Chief Whip]], but stayed there only for a year, and was moved to the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] in 1998. This change, which followed the publication of the Routledge biography earlier that year, was widely seen as a demotion,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and ascribed to his close connection with Brown.\n\nHis tenure at MAFF saw several animal health crises ending with the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak]]. Brown's handling of the outbreak, which some in the media and politics used to attack the government, was criticised, though throughout he maintained the support of the farming and food industries and the veterinary profession.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Suggestions that a [[vaccination]] strategy should have been practised in preference to the culling of hundreds of thousands of animals, made with the benefit of hindsight, did not help his cause, and he was demoted out to be the Minister of Work, with non-voting Cabinet rank, at the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] after the general election of 2001. In June 2003, he was dropped from the Government altogether, receiving news of his sacking by [[Tony Blair]] during the course of a party held to mark his 20 years as an MP.\n\nBrown remains closely allied to [[Gordon Brown]]. In 2004 he was one of the organisers of a rebellion over the government's proposals for student finance, but hours before the vote announced that he had received concessions from the Government and would now support it. It was suspected that the Chancellor had ordered him to back down, but the affair cost him some credibility. On 29 June 2007 he was announced as Brown's new Deputy Chief Whip and Minister for the North East. Following a government reshuffle, he was returned to his original government position of Government Chief Whip, retaining his position as Minister for the North East.\n\nIn 2009, Brown was put in charge of investigating questionable expense claims by Labour MPs. According to '' [[The Daily Telegraph]]'', between 2004 and 2008, he himself claimed a total of \u00a387,708 for his constituency home including \u00a318,800 for food. Allowances sought, without submission of receipts, included \u00a3200 a month for repairs, \u00a3200 a month for service and maintenance and \u00a3250 a month for a cleaner.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5346633/MPs-expenses-Nick-Brown-claims-18800-for-food-without-receipts.html|title=MPs' expenses: Nick Brown claims \u00a318,800 for food without receipts|work=The Telegraph|location=London|first1=Gordon|last1=Rayner|first2=Jon|last2=Swaine|date=19 May 2009|access-date=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202053137/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5346633/MPs-expenses-Nick-Brown-claims-18800-for-food-without-receipts.html|archive-date=2 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBrown's mortgage interest repayments for 2007-8 totalled \u00a36,600, but he also claimed a total of \u00a323,068, just \u00a315 below the maximum allowable amount for the year. The claim included \u00a34,800 for food \u2013 the maximum allowable amount \u2013 \u00a32,880 for repairs and insurance, \u00a32,880 for services, \u00a3897.65 for cleaning, \u00a31,640 for phones and \u00a31,810 for utilities. Brown, however, has said that he saved the taxpayer a considerable amount of money by turning down a Government car and driver upon being made Chief Whip, the annual cost of which would have been around \u00a3100,000.<ref>{{cite news |first=William |last=Green |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2009/05/12/mps-expenses-north-east-minister-opens-up-72703-23601259/ |title=MPs' expenses: North East Minister opens up |work=Evening Chronicle |location=Newcastle upon Tyne |date=12 May 2009 |accessdate=29 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105135600/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2009/05/12/mps-expenses-north-east-minister-opens-up-72703-23601259/ |archive-date=5 January 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn 29 January 2010, during the [[News of the World phone hacking affair|''News of the World'' phone hacking affair]], Brown said that his landline may have been bugged in an \"amateurish attempt\" in 1998, around the time of his outing.<ref name=\"indy-bugged\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/my-landline-was-bugged-as-papers-tried-to-out-me-says-nick-brown-2197771.html |author= |title=My landline was bugged as papers tried to 'out' me, says Nick Brown |work=The Independent |date=29 January 2011 |accessdate=29 January 2011 |location=London |first=Cahal |last=Milmo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129085538/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/my-landline-was-bugged-as-papers-tried-to-out-me-says-nick-brown-2197771.html |archive-date=29 January 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was also contacted by police in the West of England in 2003 who told him that they were pursuing a phone-tapping prosecution and he was one of those who may have been targeted.

After graduating, he worked in advertising for [[Procter & Gamble]], but in 1978 he moved to be legal adviser to the Northern Region of the [[GMB (trade union)|GMBATU]], based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. In 1980 he was elected to [[Newcastle City Council]], representing Walker ward. His role in the union gave him a role in maximising the union's influence in [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] selections.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Political career==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2019}}\nWhen [[Mike Thomas (politician)|Mike Thomas]], the sitting Labour [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Newcastle upon Tyne East (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle upon Tyne East]], defected to the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]], Brown was chosen as the new Labour Party candidate for the seat, easily retaining it for Labour at the 1983 general election. He joined Labour's front bench in 1985 as a spokesman on Legal Affairs; from 1988 he was a Treasury spokesman and from 1994 he shadowed Health.\n\nOriginally elected to the Commons in the same year as [[Gordon Brown]] and [[Tony Blair]] he was initially close to both men but over time he became his namesake Brown's staunchest ally, though the two are unrelated. In the [[1994 Labour Party leadership election|1994 Labour leadership election]] he acted as Brown's unofficial campaign manager, and according to [[Gordon Brown]]'s biographer [[Paul Routledge]], advised against him pulling out of the contest in Blair's favour.\n\nIn 1995, he was appointed Deputy Chief Whip and played a central role in the close Parliament in trying to defeat the Conservatives. After Labour's [[1997 United Kingdom general election|election]] victory in 1997, he was appointed [[Chief Whip]], but stayed there only for a year, and was moved to the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] in 1998. This change, which followed the publication of the Routledge biography earlier that year, was widely seen as a demotion,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and ascribed to his close connection with Brown.\n\nHis tenure at MAFF saw several animal health crises ending with the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak]]. Brown's handling of the outbreak, which some in the media and politics used to attack the government, was criticised, though throughout he maintained the support of the farming and food industries and the veterinary profession.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Suggestions that a [[vaccination]] strategy should have been practised in preference to the culling of hundreds of thousands of animals, made with the benefit of hindsight, did not help his cause, and he was demoted out to be the Minister of Work, with non-voting Cabinet rank, at the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] after the general election of 2001. In June 2003, he was dropped from the Government altogether, receiving news of his sacking by [[Tony Blair]] during the course of a party held to mark his 20 years as an MP.\n\nBrown remains closely allied to [[Gordon Brown]]. In 2004 he was one of the organisers of a rebellion over the government's proposals for student finance, but hours before the vote announced that he had received concessions from the Government and would now support it. It was suspected that the Chancellor had ordered him to back down, but the affair cost him some credibility. On 29 June 2007 he was announced as Brown's new Deputy Chief Whip and Minister for the North East. Following a government reshuffle, he was returned to his original government position of Government Chief Whip, retaining his position as Minister for the North East.\n\nIn 2009, Brown was put in charge of investigating questionable expense claims by Labour MPs. According to '' [[The Daily Telegraph]]'', between 2004 and 2008, he himself claimed a total of \u00a387,708 for his constituency home including \u00a318,800 for food. Allowances sought, without submission of receipts, included \u00a3200 a month for repairs, \u00a3200 a month for service and maintenance and \u00a3250 a month for a cleaner.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5346633/MPs-expenses-Nick-Brown-claims-18800-for-food-without-receipts.html|title=MPs' expenses: Nick Brown claims \u00a318,800 for food without receipts|work=The Telegraph|location=London|first1=Gordon|last1=Rayner|first2=Jon|last2=Swaine|date=19 May 2009|access-date=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202053137/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5346633/MPs-expenses-Nick-Brown-claims-18800-for-food-without-receipts.html|archive-date=2 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBrown's mortgage interest repayments for 2007-8 totalled \u00a36,600, but he also claimed a total of \u00a323,068, just \u00a315 below the maximum allowable amount for the year. The claim included \u00a34,800 for food \u2013 the maximum allowable amount \u2013 \u00a32,880 for repairs and insurance, \u00a32,880 for services, \u00a3897.65 for cleaning, \u00a31,640 for phones and \u00a31,810 for utilities. Brown, however, has said that he saved the taxpayer a considerable amount of money by turning down a Government car and driver upon being made Chief Whip, the annual cost of which would have been around \u00a3100,000.<ref>{{cite news |first=William |last=Green |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2009/05/12/mps-expenses-north-east-minister-opens-up-72703-23601259/ |title=MPs' expenses: North East Minister opens up |work=Evening Chronicle |location=Newcastle upon Tyne |date=12 May 2009 |accessdate=29 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105135600/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2009/05/12/mps-expenses-north-east-minister-opens-up-72703-23601259/ |archive-date=5 January 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn 29 January 2010, during the [[News of the World phone hacking affair|''News of the World'' phone hacking affair]], Brown said that his landline may have been bugged in an \"amateurish attempt\" in 1998, around the time of his outing.<ref name=\"indy-bugged\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/my-landline-was-bugged-as-papers-tried-to-out-me-says-nick-brown-2197771.html |author= |title=My landline was bugged as papers tried to 'out' me, says Nick Brown |work=The Independent |date=29 January 2011 |accessdate=29 January 2011 |location=London |first=Cahal |last=Milmo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129085538/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/my-landline-was-bugged-as-papers-tried-to-out-me-says-nick-brown-2197771.html |archive-date=29 January 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was also contacted by police in the West of England in 2003 who told him that they were pursuing a phone-tapping prosecution and he was one of those who may have been targeted.

The election used the eight [[ward (politics)|wards]], created under the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]], with each ward electing three or four councillors using the [[single transferable vote]] system, a form of [[proportional representation]]. A total of 28 councillors were elected, one less than in 2012.\n\nFollowing the 2012{{clarify|date=February 2020}} election the Scottish National Party formed the administration on the Council. Cllr Ian Gaul (Kirriemuir and Dean) was appointed Leader of the Council at the subsequent statutory meeting; Cllr Paul Valentine (Montrose) became [[deputy|Depute]] Leader; and Cllr Helen Oswald (Carnoustie and District) was elected Provost.\n\n==Election result==\n\n{{Election Summary Begin|title = Angus Local Election Result 2017}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish National Party\n  |seats      = 9\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 6\n  |net        = -6\n  |seats %    = 32.1\n  |votes %    = 31.2\n  |votes      = 12,657\n  |plus/minus = -13.2\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Independent (politician)\n  |seats      = 9\n  |gain       = 1\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = +1\n  |seats %    = 32.1\n  |votes %    = 25.0\n  |votes      = 10,144\n  |plus/minus = +0.2\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Conservative Party\n  |seats      = 8\n  |gain       = +4\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = +4\n  |seats %    = 28.6\n  |votes %    = 33.9\n  |votes      = 13,741\n  |plus/minus = +16.1\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Liberal Democrats\n  |seats      = 2\n  |gain       = 2\n  |loss       = 1\n  |net        = +1\n  |seats %    = 7.1\n  |votes %    = 4.6\n  |votes      = 1,873\n  |plus/minus = -1.2\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Labour Party\n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 1\n  |net        = -1\n  |seats %    = 0\n  |votes %    = 5.4\n  |votes      = 2,178\n  |plus/minus = -2.0\n}}\n\n{{Election box end}}\n<small>'''Note:''' \"Votes\" are the first preference votes.

It is headquartered in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Miramax was founded in 1979 by brothers [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]], and was a leading independent film motion picture distribution and production company before it was acquired by [[The Walt Disney Company]] on June 30, 1993. The Weinsteins operated Miramax with more creative and financial independence than any other division of Disney until September 30, 2005, when they left the company and founded a new studio, [[The Weinstein Company]]. Miramax was sold by Disney to [[Filmyard Holdings]], a joint venture of [[Colony NorthStar]], [[Tutor-Saliba Corporation]], and [[Qatar Investment Authority]], in 2010, ending Disney's 17-year ownership of the studio. In 2016, the company was sold to the [[beIN Media Group]]. In 2019, beIN agreed to sell a 49% stake in the company to [[ViacomCBS]] (via its [[Paramount Pictures]] unit); the sale was completed on April 3, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/04/viacomcbs-deal-stake-miramax-closes-1202899997/|title=ViacomCBS Closes Purchase Of Stake In Miramax, With Distribution And First Look Deals|last=Goldsmith|first=Jill|last2=Goldsmith|first2=Jill|date=2020-04-03|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Independent era (1979\u20131993)===\nThe company was founded by the brothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1979, and was named by combining the first names of their parents, Miriam and Max.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/04/max-weinstein-200304|title=All Thanks to Max|last=Weinstein|first=Bob|author-link=Bob Weinstein|date=April 2003|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]}}</ref> It was created to distribute [[independent film]]s deemed commercially unfeasible by the [[Major film studio|major studios]].\n\nThe company's first major success came when the Weinsteins teamed up with British producer [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] and acquired the U.S. rights to two concert films Lewis had produced of [[Benefit concert|benefit shows]] for [[human rights]] organization [[Amnesty International]]. The Weinsteins worked with Lewis to distill the two films into one film for the American marketplace. The resulting film, the American version of ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' was a successful release for Miramax in the summer of 1982. This release presaged a ''modus operandi'' that the company would undertake later in the 1980s of acquiring films from international filmmakers and reworking them to suit American sensibilities and audiences.\n\nAmong the company's other breakthrough films as distributors in the late 1980s and early 1990s were ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''; ''[[Scandal (1989 film)|Scandal]]''; ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]''; ''[[Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!]]''; ''[[The Crying Game]],'' and ''[[Clerks]]''. The company also made films such as ''[[Flirting with Disaster (film)|Flirting with Disaster]]'', ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' and ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]''.\n\nMiramax acquired and/or produced many other films that did extraordinarily well financially. The company became one of the leaders of the independent film boom of the 1990s. Miramax produced or distributed seven films with box office grosses totaling more than $100&nbsp;million; its most successful title, ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'', earned more than $300 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1816888833/|title=Chicago|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=February 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe company was also exceptionally successful in securing [[Academy Award]] nominations for its releases, many of which resulted in [[Academy Award|Oscar]] wins.\n\nIn 1992, Miramax began a deal with [[Paramount Pictures]] for home video and television distribution of certain Miramax releases. Paramount would also distribute theatrically certain releases that might have commercial appeal (such as ''[[Bob Roberts]]'', though video rights to that film were owned by [[Artisan Entertainment|LIVE Entertainment]] \u2013 which is now [[Lionsgate|Lions Gate Entertainment]]). Paramount still owns home video rights to some of these films, while television distribution is now with [[Trifecta Entertainment & Media]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1139F935A35751C0A964958260|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Miramax Deal On Distribution|date=February 6, 1992|access-date=May 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Disney era (1993\u20132010)===\nOn June 30, 1993, Miramax was purchased for $60 million by [[The Walt Disney Company]], which paved a way for Disney to enter the independent film market.<ref name=Mason>{{cite web|last=Mason|first=Ian Garrick|title=When Harvey met Mickey|work=New Statesman|location=UK|date=October 11, 2004|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/160714|access-date=January 11, 2007}}</ref> Bob and Harvey Weinstein continued to operate Miramax until they left the company on September 30, 2005. During their tenure, the Weinstein brothers ran Miramax independently of other Disney subsidiaries, and as a result had more autonomy than the other Disney-owned companies (for example, Miramax International, the international distribution arm of Miramax, distributed films both to cinemas and video through local independent affiliates and not also contracted with Disney or contracted with, but separately). Disney, however, had the final say on what Miramax could release (see ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' and ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', for examples).<ref name=Mason/> Disney's [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Buena Vista Home Entertainment]] division released Miramax output on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray Disc in some countries, including U.S.\n\nIn addition to owning Miramax between 1993 and 2010, Disney also owned the rights to Miramax's pre-1993 library at the time.\n\nWith a more stable budget, Miramax began moving beyond acquisitions and distribution and into film productions. Until September 30, 2005 the company also operated the label [[Dimension Films]], which was solely founded by Bob to specialize in teen, horror, and other genre films,<ref name=Mason/> and created the ''[[Scream (franchise)|Scream]]'' and ''[[Scary Movie (film series)|Scary Movie]]'' film franchises. Harvey funded larger projects and from up and coming directors including [[Robert Rodriguez]], [[Gus Van Sant]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Some of the films earned Oscars.<ref name=\"Mason\" />\n\nIn 1997, Miramax joined [[Peter Jackson]] as a primary financial backer in attempting to get the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' films produced. Disney disliked the cost of a two-parter, requesting that it be produced as a single film. Jackson and [[Saul Zaentz]] rejected Disney's request and looked for another studio or financier. Thus, Miramax sold the rights for ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' to [[New Line Cinema]] in August 1998 for about $12 million, which led ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be produced as a trilogy. Miramax retained a 5% stake in the films' gross and then gave 2.5% to the Weinsteins.<ref name=smh>{{cite news|last=Quinn|first=Karl|title=Lord of the Rings a chronicle of legal disputes|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/lord-of-the-rings-a-chronicle-of-legal-disputes-20131213-2zcxp.html|access-date=November 6, 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=14 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThrough Miramax, Harvey founded ''[[Talk (magazine)|Talk]]'' magazine with [[Tina Brown]] in 1998 (it shut down in 2002), albeit without the approval of then-Disney chief [[Michael Eisner]], which upset Eisner. Also that year, 30 former employees filed suit over unpaid overtime wages.<ref name=\"Mason\" />\n\nBy 2003, Miramax was less operative in the independent film market and became more of a mini-major as the company only acquired 3 films while producing ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'' for $80 million. The Weinsteins claimed the company was profitable, but Walt Disney Co. president [[Robert Iger]] indicated in June 2004 that they were not properly accounting for \"account standard overhead, distribution fees, bonuses that we pay Bob and Harvey. Nor are they applying current accounting rules.\"<ref name=\"Mason\" />\n\nAfter extensive negotiations and much media and industry speculation, on March 30, 2005, Disney and the Weinsteins announced that they would not renew their contractual relationship when their existing agreements expired at the end of September 2005. The primary source of dispute was over distribution of ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' by Michael Moore.<ref name=lsun/> Disney's film studio consortium, [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group]], assumed control of Miramax, which was projected to have a smaller annual production budget. The Weinsteins started a new film production company called [[The Weinstein Company]], and took the [[Dimension Films]] label with them. The Miramax name remained with the film studio owned by Disney. Production at Miramax was taken over by [[Daniel Battsek]],<ref name=lsun>{{cite news|title=Miramax offices close, Disney says brand continues|agency=Associated Press|website=Boston.com|date=January 29, 2010|url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/01/29/miramax_offices_close_disney_says_brand_continues/}}</ref> who had been head of [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures#International arrangements|Buena Vista International]] in the [[Great Britain|UK]].

It is headquartered in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Miramax was founded in 1979 by brothers [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]], and was a leading independent film motion picture distribution and production company before it was acquired by [[The Walt Disney Company]] on June 30, 1993. The Weinsteins operated Miramax with more creative and financial independence than any other division of Disney until September 30, 2005, when they left the company and founded a new studio, [[The Weinstein Company]]. Miramax was sold by Disney to [[Filmyard Holdings]], a joint venture of [[Colony NorthStar]], [[Tutor-Saliba Corporation]], and [[Qatar Investment Authority]], in 2010, ending Disney's 17-year ownership of the studio. In 2016, the company was sold to the [[beIN Media Group]]. In 2019, beIN agreed to sell a 49% stake in the company to [[ViacomCBS]] (via its [[Paramount Pictures]] unit); the sale was completed on April 3, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/04/viacomcbs-deal-stake-miramax-closes-1202899997/|title=ViacomCBS Closes Purchase Of Stake In Miramax, With Distribution And First Look Deals|last=Goldsmith|first=Jill|last2=Goldsmith|first2=Jill|date=2020-04-03|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Independent era (1979\u20131993)===\nThe company was founded by the brothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1979, and was named by combining the first names of their parents, Miriam and Max.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/04/max-weinstein-200304|title=All Thanks to Max|last=Weinstein|first=Bob|author-link=Bob Weinstein|date=April 2003|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]}}</ref> It was created to distribute [[independent film]]s deemed commercially unfeasible by the [[Major film studio|major studios]].\n\nThe company's first major success came when the Weinsteins teamed up with British producer [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] and acquired the U.S. rights to two concert films Lewis had produced of [[Benefit concert|benefit shows]] for [[human rights]] organization [[Amnesty International]]. The Weinsteins worked with Lewis to distill the two films into one film for the American marketplace. The resulting film, the American version of ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' was a successful release for Miramax in the summer of 1982. This release presaged a ''modus operandi'' that the company would undertake later in the 1980s of acquiring films from international filmmakers and reworking them to suit American sensibilities and audiences.\n\nAmong the company's other breakthrough films as distributors in the late 1980s and early 1990s were ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''; ''[[Scandal (1989 film)|Scandal]]''; ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]''; ''[[Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!]]''; ''[[The Crying Game]],'' and ''[[Clerks]]''. The company also made films such as ''[[Flirting with Disaster (film)|Flirting with Disaster]]'', ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' and ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]''.\n\nMiramax acquired and/or produced many other films that did extraordinarily well financially. The company became one of the leaders of the independent film boom of the 1990s. Miramax produced or distributed seven films with box office grosses totaling more than $100&nbsp;million; its most successful title, ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'', earned more than $300 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1816888833/|title=Chicago|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=February 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe company was also exceptionally successful in securing [[Academy Award]] nominations for its releases, many of which resulted in [[Academy Award|Oscar]] wins.\n\nIn 1992, Miramax began a deal with [[Paramount Pictures]] for home video and television distribution of certain Miramax releases. Paramount would also distribute theatrically certain releases that might have commercial appeal (such as ''[[Bob Roberts]]'', though video rights to that film were owned by [[Artisan Entertainment|LIVE Entertainment]] \u2013 which is now [[Lionsgate|Lions Gate Entertainment]]). Paramount still owns home video rights to some of these films, while television distribution is now with [[Trifecta Entertainment & Media]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1139F935A35751C0A964958260|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Miramax Deal On Distribution|date=February 6, 1992|access-date=May 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Disney era (1993\u20132010)===\nOn June 30, 1993, Miramax was purchased for $60 million by [[The Walt Disney Company]], which paved a way for Disney to enter the independent film market.<ref name=Mason>{{cite web|last=Mason|first=Ian Garrick|title=When Harvey met Mickey|work=New Statesman|location=UK|date=October 11, 2004|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/160714|access-date=January 11, 2007}}</ref> Bob and Harvey Weinstein continued to operate Miramax until they left the company on September 30, 2005. During their tenure, the Weinstein brothers ran Miramax independently of other Disney subsidiaries, and as a result had more autonomy than the other Disney-owned companies (for example, Miramax International, the international distribution arm of Miramax, distributed films both to cinemas and video through local independent affiliates and not also contracted with Disney or contracted with, but separately). Disney, however, had the final say on what Miramax could release (see ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' and ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', for examples).<ref name=Mason/> Disney's [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Buena Vista Home Entertainment]] division released Miramax output on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray Disc in some countries, including U.S.\n\nIn addition to owning Miramax between 1993 and 2010, Disney also owned the rights to Miramax's pre-1993 library at the time.\n\nWith a more stable budget, Miramax began moving beyond acquisitions and distribution and into film productions. Until September 30, 2005 the company also operated the label [[Dimension Films]], which was solely founded by Bob to specialize in teen, horror, and other genre films,<ref name=Mason/> and created the ''[[Scream (franchise)|Scream]]'' and ''[[Scary Movie (film series)|Scary Movie]]'' film franchises. Harvey funded larger projects and from up and coming directors including [[Robert Rodriguez]], [[Gus Van Sant]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Some of the films earned Oscars.<ref name=\"Mason\" />\n\nIn 1997, Miramax joined [[Peter Jackson]] as a primary financial backer in attempting to get the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' films produced. Disney disliked the cost of a two-parter, requesting that it be produced as a single film. Jackson and [[Saul Zaentz]] rejected Disney's request and looked for another studio or financier. Thus, Miramax sold the rights for ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' to [[New Line Cinema]] in August 1998 for about $12 million, which led ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be produced as a trilogy. Miramax retained a 5% stake in the films' gross and then gave 2.5% to the Weinsteins.<ref name=smh>{{cite news|last=Quinn|first=Karl|title=Lord of the Rings a chronicle of legal disputes|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/lord-of-the-rings-a-chronicle-of-legal-disputes-20131213-2zcxp.html|access-date=November 6, 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=14 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThrough Miramax, Harvey founded ''[[Talk (magazine)|Talk]]'' magazine with [[Tina Brown]] in 1998 (it shut down in 2002), albeit without the approval of then-Disney chief [[Michael Eisner]], which upset Eisner. Also that year, 30 former employees filed suit over unpaid overtime wages.<ref name=\"Mason\" />\n\nBy 2003, Miramax was less operative in the independent film market and became more of a mini-major as the company only acquired 3 films while producing ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'' for $80 million. The Weinsteins claimed the company was profitable, but Walt Disney Co. president [[Robert Iger]] indicated in June 2004 that they were not properly accounting for \"account standard overhead, distribution fees, bonuses that we pay Bob and Harvey. Nor are they applying current accounting rules.\"<ref name=\"Mason\" />\n\nAfter extensive negotiations and much media and industry speculation, on March 30, 2005, Disney and the Weinsteins announced that they would not renew their contractual relationship when their existing agreements expired at the end of September 2005. The primary source of dispute was over distribution of ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' by Michael Moore.<ref name=lsun/> Disney's film studio consortium, [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group]], assumed control of Miramax, which was projected to have a smaller annual production budget. The Weinsteins started a new film production company called [[The Weinstein Company]], and took the [[Dimension Films]] label with them. The Miramax name remained with the film studio owned by Disney. Production at Miramax was taken over by [[Daniel Battsek]],<ref name=lsun>{{cite news|title=Miramax offices close, Disney says brand continues|agency=Associated Press|website=Boston.com|date=January 29, 2010|url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/01/29/miramax_offices_close_disney_says_brand_continues/}}</ref> who had been head of [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures#International arrangements|Buena Vista International]] in the [[Great Britain|UK]].

The population was 7,313 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], a decrease from 7,731 in the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Marion County, Iowa|Marion County]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-31 }}</ref> Knoxville is home of the [[National Sprint Car Hall of Fame & Museum]], located next to the famous [[Knoxville Raceway]] dirt track.\n\n==History==\nThe site for the future county seat of Marion County was selected because it was within a mile of the geographic center of the county, reasonably level and near a good source of timber.\n\nKnoxville is located in south-central Iowa, some 35 miles southeast of Des Moines. The area was originally inhabited by Native Americans of the Sac and Fox tribes. At that time, prairie grass covered the countryside at heights of 8 to 10 feet. In 1835, Dragoons first explored the Des Moines River valley through this area. In 1842, the Sac and Fox Indians signed a treaty to sell lands in central Iowa to the new settlers known as the New Purchase of 1842. By 1843, settlers began moving here. The first Marion County Courthouse was erected three years later.\n\nKnoxville was founded in 1845 when Joseph Robinson and James Montgomery, Commissioners from Scott and Wapello County, selected the site for Knoxville and designated it as the county seat. They named Knoxville in honor of General Henry Knox, hero of the Revolutionary War. The City's main streets are named after Robinson and Montgomery.\n\nCounty surveyor Isaac B. Powers platted part of the town in September 1845, shortly after it was located. Clairborne Hall laid out the remainder of the town in the winter of 1846\u201347. Additional surveys were made in December 1849 and September 1852.\n\nThe first sale of lots on October 21, 1845 saw the best sites in town go for $15 to $65. The first survey made the streets 80 feet wide, alleys 10 feet wide, and lots 120\u2019 x 60\u2019, but the third survey changed the width of the streets to 50 feet, and made the blocks 265\u2019 x 240\u2019.\n\nThe first Marion County courthouse was built on a lot owned by L.C. Corny. Contractor Lewis M. Pearch started work on May 29, 1846 at a cost of approximately $80,000.\n\nKnoxville remained an unincorporated village until 1853, when a movement for incorporation began. A judicial order was issued after an election in which 64 votes were cast in favor of incorporation, with 4 votes against. Knoxville was duly incorporated as a City in 1855.\n\n[[File:Marion County, Iowa Courthouse.jpg|thumb|left|200px|<center>Marion County Courthouse</center>]]\nIn early 1853, the citizens of Marion County created a committee to attract railroad development to the county and to Knoxville, promising to buy shares in any railroad that reached town.  The first contender was the Muscatine, Oskaloosa & Council Bluffs, proposing an east\u2013west line that would pass through Knoxville, the line being suggested in January 1868 by the proposed Muscatine, Oskaloosa & Council Bluffs.<ref>[http://iagenweb.org/keokuk/1880/I&WRAILROAD.htm] I & W Railroad History, accessed January 2017</ref> By 1875, when this line reached Knoxville, it was the [[Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad]]. The second railroad to reach Knoxville was the [[Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific]], which completed a line from [[Oskaloosa, Iowa|Oskaloosa]] in 1876.<ref>pages 235-238.</ref>\n\nSystematic coal mining in Marion County began with the Union Coal Company's mine in Flagler, {{convert|4|mi|km}} east of Knoxville in around 1874 or 1875.  For several years, the Number 5 mine in Flagler was one of the most productive in Iowa, employing around 150 men and working a coal vein over 8 feet (2.5 m) thick.  The Oak Hill coal company also had mines in Flagler.\n\nShortly after the railroad reached Knoxville, J. T. James opened a coal mine in town just 8 blocks north of the courthouse.  This mine continued in operation until 1890. A second mine nearby was operated by W. A. Gamble.  In the 1880s, the White Breast Fuel Company opened the Number 11 mine at Flagler.  This mine operated in a coal vein that was locally up to 14 feet thick, but only locally. The mine continued operating until 1892, working in progressively thinner coal as it expanded.<ref>John W.

The population was 7,313 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], a decrease from 7,731 in the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Marion County, Iowa|Marion County]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-31 }}</ref> Knoxville is home of the [[National Sprint Car Hall of Fame & Museum]], located next to the famous [[Knoxville Raceway]] dirt track.\n\n==History==\nThe site for the future county seat of Marion County was selected because it was within a mile of the geographic center of the county, reasonably level and near a good source of timber.\n\nKnoxville is located in south-central Iowa, some 35 miles southeast of Des Moines. The area was originally inhabited by Native Americans of the Sac and Fox tribes. At that time, prairie grass covered the countryside at heights of 8 to 10 feet. In 1835, Dragoons first explored the Des Moines River valley through this area. In 1842, the Sac and Fox Indians signed a treaty to sell lands in central Iowa to the new settlers known as the New Purchase of 1842. By 1843, settlers began moving here. The first Marion County Courthouse was erected three years later.\n\nKnoxville was founded in 1845 when Joseph Robinson and James Montgomery, Commissioners from Scott and Wapello County, selected the site for Knoxville and designated it as the county seat. They named Knoxville in honor of General Henry Knox, hero of the Revolutionary War. The City's main streets are named after Robinson and Montgomery.\n\nCounty surveyor Isaac B. Powers platted part of the town in September 1845, shortly after it was located. Clairborne Hall laid out the remainder of the town in the winter of 1846-47. Additional surveys were made in December 1849 and September 1852.\n\nThe first sale of lots on October 21, 1845 saw the best sites in town go for $15 to $65. The first survey made the streets 80 feet wide, alleys 10 feet wide, and lots 120\u2019 x 60\u2019, but the third survey changed the width of the streets to 50 feet, and made the blocks 265\u2019 x 240\u2019.\n\nThe first Marion County courthouse was built on a lot owned by L.C. Corny. Contractor Lewis M. Pearch started work on May 29, 1846 at a cost of approximately $80,000.\n\nKnoxville remained an unincorporated village until 1853, when a movement for incorporation began. A judicial order was issued after an election in which 64 votes were cast in favor of incorporation, with 4 votes against. Knoxville was duly incorporated as a City in 1855.\n\n[[File:Marion County, Iowa Courthouse.jpg|thumb|left|200px|<center>Marion County Courthouse</center>]]\nIn early 1853, the citizens of Marion County created a committee to attract railroad development to the county and to Knoxville, promising to buy shares in any railroad that reached town.  The first contender was the Muscatine, Oskaloosa & Council Bluffs, proposing an east-west line that would pass through Knoxville, the line being suggested in January 1868 by the proposed Muscatine, Oskaloosa & Council Bluffs.<ref>[http://iagenweb.org/keokuk/1880/I&WRAILROAD.htm] I & W Railroad History, accessed January 2017</ref> By 1875, when this line reached Knoxville, it was the [[Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad]]. The second railroad to reach Knoxville was the [[Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific]], which completed a line from [[Oskaloosa, Iowa|Oskaloosa]] in 1876.<ref>pages 235-238.</ref>\n\nSystematic coal mining in Marion County began with the Union Coal Company's mine in Flagler, {{convert|4|mi|km}} east of Knoxville in around 1874 or 1875.  For several years, the Number 5 mine in Flagler was one of the most productive in Iowa, employing around 150 men and working a coal vein over 8 feet (2.5 m) thick.  The Oak Hill coal company also had mines in Flagler.\n\nShortly after the railroad reached Knoxville, J. T. James opened a coal mine in town just 8 blocks north of the courthouse.  This mine continued in operation until 1890. A second mine nearby was operated by W. A. Gamble.  In the 1880s, the White Breast Fuel Company opened the Number 11 mine at Flagler.  This mine operated in a coal vein that was locally up to 14 feet thick, but only locally. The mine continued operating until 1892, working in progressively thinner coal as it expanded.<ref>John W.

{"title_page": "Art Young", "text_new": "{{hatnote|\"Art Young\" is also the name of a [[DC Comics]] editor who co-founded the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] imprint.}}\n\n[[File:Art Young (1866-1943).jpg|thumb|Art Young, circa 1914]]\n'''Arthur Henry \"Art\" Young''' (January 14, 1866 \u2013 December 29, 1943) was an [[United States|American]] [[cartoon]]ist and writer. He is best known for his [[Socialism|socialist]] cartoons, especially those drawn for the left-wing political magazine ''[[The Masses]]'' between 1911 and 1917.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nArt Young was born January 14, 1866, near [[Orangeville, Illinois|Orangeville]], in [[Stephenson County, Illinois|Stephenson County]], [[Illinois]].  His family moved to [[Monroe, Wisconsin]], when he was a year old. He enrolled in the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago|Chicago Academy of Design]] in 1884, where he studied under [[John Vanderpoel|J. H. Vanderpoel]]. His first published cartoon appeared the same year in the trade paper, ''Nimble Nickel''. Also in that same year, he began working for a succession of [[Chicago]] newspapers including the ''Evening Mail'', the ''[[Chicago Daily News|Daily News]]'', and the ''[[Chicago Tribune|Tribune]]''.\n\nIn 1888, Young resumed his studies, first at the [[Art Students League of New York]] (until 1889), then at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] in [[Paris]] (1889\u201390). Following a long convalescence, he joined the ''[[Chicago Inter-Ocean]]'' (1892), to which he contributed [[political cartoon]]s and drawings for its Sunday color supplement.\n\nIn 1895 he married Elizabeth North. In 1895 or 1896, he worked briefly for the ''Denver Times'', then moved again to New York City after his separation with North, where he sold drawings to the humor magazines ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', and ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'', and drew cartoons for [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[New York Evening Journal]]'' and Sunday ''[[New York American]]''. From 1902 to 1906, Young studied rhetoric at [[Cooper Union]] in order to improve his skills as a cartoonist.\n\n===''The Masses''===\n[[File:2108-young-arrestthisman.jpg|alt=|thumb|Political cartoon by Art Young, first published in Young's magazine, ''[[Good Morning (magazine)|Good Morning]]'', Aug. 1921]]\n\nYoung started out as a generally apolitical [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], but gradually became interested in [[left wing]] ideas, and by 1906 or so considered himself a socialist. Young would begin increasingly to associate with such political leftist as [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] and Piet Vlag, both of whom he would work with at the radical socialist monthly, ''[[The Masses]]''. He became firmly ensconced in the radical environment of Greenwich Village after moving there in 1910. He became politically active, and by 1910, [[Racism|racial]] and [[Sexism|sexual discrimination]] and the apparent injustices of the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] system became prevalent themes in his work. Young would explain these sentiments in his autobiography, ''Art Young: His Life and Times'' (1939),\n\n<blockquote>\nI am antagonistic to the money-making fetish because it sidetracks our natural selves, leaving us no alternative but to accept the situation and take ''any'' kind of work for a weekly wage [...] We are caught and hurt by the system, and the more sensitive we are to life's highest values the harder it is to bear the abuse.<ref>Young, Art. ''Art Young: His Life and Times.'' Ed. John Nicholas Beffel. New York: Sheridan, 1939. 452. Print</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn an attempt to curb this abuse, Young ran for the [[New York State Assembly]] on the ticket of the Socialist Party of New York City (Part of the [[Socialist Party of America]], SPUSA) in 1913 but was unsuccessful.\n\nOne facet of the establishment Young challenged in his cartoons and drawings was the [[Associated Press]]. His attacks became overt and damning once he joined the staff of the ''Masses'' as a co-editor and contributor. He held this position from 1911 to 1918. Young was one of the few original editorial members that stayed with the magazine for its entire run until it folded in December 1917. In July 1913, the magazine published Young's cartoon \"Poisoned at the Source\", which depicted the AP's president, [[Frank Brett Noyes|Frank B. Noyes]], poisoning a well labeled \"The News\" with lies, suppressed facts, slander, and prejudice. The cartoon was a response to the lack of national news coverage on the [[Paint Creek-Cabin Creek strike of 1912]] in [[Kanawha County, West Virginia]]. The strike had lasted more than a year, and was characterized by deadly clashes between miners and militia hired by the coal companies. The coal companies were successful in having the Federal government declare martial law under a military tribunal, an egregious act according to the editors of the ''Masses''.\n\nThe fact that little had been heard about these occurrences outside of West Virginia troubled those on the magazine's staff. Young's cartoon and Max Eastman's editorial, published in the same issue, claimed the AP had willfully suppressed the facts in order to aid the coal companies. The AP responded in kind with two suits of libel against Eastman and Young on November 1913 and January 1914. Both suits eventually were dropped after Young and Eastman's attorney subpoenaed the records of the AP's Pittsburgh office, possibly out of fear that the testimony and evidence would be damaging after becoming public through the legal proceedings.\n\n===''The Liberator''===\nIn 1918 Young subsequently helped to establish a similar publication to the ''Masses'', the above-mentioned ''Liberator''.  He also served as an illustrator and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] correspondent for ''[[Metropolitan Magazine (New York)|Metropolitan Magazine]]'' (1912\u201317) until the magazine released him due to his outspoken anti-war sentiments. In 1918, Young again ran unsuccessfully for public office on the Socialist ticket, this time for the [[New York State Senate]].\n\nUnhappy with the way that editors Max and Crystal Eastman and a few others were able to live off the struggling magazine, while he received a nominal fee or worked pro bono, Young left ''The Liberator'' in 1919 to start a magazine of his own, ''[[Good Morning (magazine)|Good Morning]]''. This publication was later absorbed by the ''Art Young Quarterly'' in 1922.\n\n===Other publications===\nYoung also contributed illustrations to ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'', ''[[New Leader]]'', ''[[New Masses]]'', ''The Coming Nation'', ''Dawn'', ''The Call'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (after 1930), and ''Big Stick''.  Of the many books he wrote, two, ''On My Way'' (1928) and ''Art Young: His Life and Times'' (1939), are autobiographical.  Of special note are his series of drawings depicting Hell, published in ''[[Cosmopolitan magazine]]'' and in several books, including ''Through Hell With Hiprah Hunt'', available at Google Books.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Through Hell with Hiprah Hunt\n|author=Arthur Henry Young,  Art Young\n|year=1901\n|publisher=Zimmerman's\n|isbn=\n|url=https://archive.org/details/throughhellwith00youngoog\n|quote=hiprah.\n}}</ref> He issued a collection of his drawings, ''The Best of Art Young'', in 1936.\n\n===Legal difficulties===\n====First ''Masses'' Trial====\n[[File:Having Their Fling.jpg|thumb|''Having Their Fling'' by Art Young was brought into court as evidence during the second trial in September/October 1918.]]\nYoung would continue to get himself into legal trouble with his drawings during his years at the ''Masses''. In October 1917, Art Young, [[Max Eastman]], [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], [[Floyd Dell]], Merrill Rogers, and a one-time contributor were charged under the [[Espionage Act]] by the federal government on the charge of conspiracy to obstruct enlistment. The trial began in April the following year and Young was asked to justify his cartoon \"Having Their Fling\" in which four men, an editor, a capitalist, a politician, and a minister are depicted dancing in orgiastic bliss as Satan leads a band of war implements. Young stated he was simply illustrating [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman's]] well-known saying that \"war is hell.\" It seemed appropriate to Young, then, to have Satan as the conductor. The first trial ended in a hung jury. The official tally was 11-1 for conviction.\n\n====Second ''Masses'' Trial====\nThe second trial began in September 1918, and it was as full of humor and irreverence as the first, perhaps more humorous for the historian than for Young. Throughout the trial, Young had the tendency to nap, an act that brought him dangerously close to being charged with contempt of court. Afraid Young would get into more trouble than he already was, his attorneys insisted he be awakened and given a pencil and pad. Young took the pencil and pad and quickly completed a self-portrait. The drawing, \"Art Young on Trial for His Life\", appeared in the ''[[The Liberator (socialist)|Liberator]]'' in June 1918. The cartoon depicted Young slumped in a chair, dozing the trial away.\n\nYoung's propensity for napping worked to the defendant's advantage during the closing arguments. Prosecutor Barnes, wrapped in an American flag and giving a moving speech, told a story of a dead soldier in France. This soldier, Barnes claimed, \"is but one of a thousand whose voices are not silent. He died for you and he died for me. He died for Max Eastman. He died for John Reed. He died for Merrill Rogers. He demands that these men be punished.\"<ref>Fishbein, Leslie. ''Rebels in Bohemia: The Radicals of The'' Masses, 1911-1917. Chapel Hill: U of North Carolina P, 1982. 28. Print.</ref> Roused from his slumber by the impassioned speech, Young exclaimed, \"What! Didn't he die for me too?\" The beautiful oration successfully ruined, the second jury was unable to convict or acquit. Eight jurors voted for acquittal and four for conviction. It would be the last time Young appeared in court for the charges, as they were dropped after failing twice to garner any convictions.\n\n===Death===\nArt Young died on December 29, 1943, at the Hotel Irving in [[New York City]] at age 77.<ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Art Young |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/12/31/archives/art-young.html |quote=Art Young, who died in this city Wednesday night at the age of 77, wouldn't have liked to have it said that he was a lovable soul in spite of his sometimes heterodox opinions.

He is best known for his [[Socialism|socialist]] cartoons, especially those drawn for the left-wing political magazine ''[[The Masses]]'' between 1911 and 1917.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nArt Young was born January 14, 1866, near [[Orangeville, Illinois|Orangeville]], in [[Stephenson County, Illinois|Stephenson County]], [[Illinois]].  His family moved to [[Monroe, Wisconsin]], when he was a year old. He enrolled in the [[Chicago Academy of Design]] in 1884, where he studied under [[John Vanderpoel|J. H. Vanderpoel]]. His first published cartoon appeared the same year in the trade paper, ''Nimble Nickel''. Also in that same year, he began working for a succession of [[Chicago]] newspapers including the ''Evening Mail'', the ''[[Chicago Daily News|Daily News]]'', and the ''[[Chicago Tribune|Tribune]]''.\n\nIn 1888, Young resumed his studies, first at the [[Art Students League of New York]] (until 1889), then at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] in [[Paris]] (1889\u201390). Following a long convalescence, he joined the ''[[Chicago Inter-Ocean]]'' (1892), to which he contributed [[political cartoon]]s and drawings for its Sunday color supplement.\n\nIn 1895 he married Elizabeth North. In 1895 or 1896, he worked briefly for the ''Denver Times'', then moved again to New York City after his separation with North, where he sold drawings to the humor magazines ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', and ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'', and drew cartoons for [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[New York Evening Journal]]'' and Sunday ''[[New York American]]''. From 1902 to 1906, Young studied rhetoric at [[Cooper Union]] in order to improve his skills as a cartoonist.\n\n===''The Masses''===\n[[File:2108-young-arrestthisman.jpg|alt=|thumb|Political cartoon by Art Young, first published in Young's magazine, ''[[Good Morning (magazine)|Good Morning]]'', Aug. 1921]]\n\nYoung started out as a generally apolitical [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], but gradually became interested in [[left wing]] ideas, and by 1906 or so considered himself a socialist. Young would begin increasingly to associate with such political leftist as [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]] and Piet Vlag, both of whom he would work with at the radical socialist monthly, ''[[The Masses]]''. He became firmly ensconced in the radical environment of Greenwich Village after moving there in 1910. He became politically active, and by 1910, [[Racism|racial]] and [[Sexism|sexual discrimination]] and the apparent injustices of the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] system became prevalent themes in his work. Young would explain these sentiments in his autobiography, ''Art Young: His Life and Times'' (1939),\n\n<blockquote>\nI am antagonistic to the money-making fetish because it sidetracks our natural selves, leaving us no alternative but to accept the situation and take ''any'' kind of work for a weekly wage [...] We are caught and hurt by the system, and the more sensitive we are to life's highest values the harder it is to bear the abuse.<ref>Young, Art. ''Art Young: His Life and Times.'' Ed. John Nicholas Beffel. New York: Sheridan, 1939. 452. Print</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn an attempt to curb this abuse, Young ran for the [[New York State Assembly]] on the ticket of the Socialist Party of New York City (Part of the [[Socialist Party of America]], SPUSA) in 1913 but was unsuccessful.\n\nOne facet of the establishment Young challenged in his cartoons and drawings was the [[Associated Press]]. His attacks became overt and damning once he joined the staff of the ''Masses'' as a co-editor and contributor. He held this position from 1911 to 1918. Young was one of the few original editorial members that stayed with the magazine for its entire run until it folded in December 1917. In July 1913, the magazine published Young's cartoon \"Poisoned at the Source\", which depicted the AP's president, [[Frank Brett Noyes|Frank B. Noyes]], poisoning a well labeled \"The News\" with lies, suppressed facts, slander, and prejudice. The cartoon was a response to the lack of national news coverage on the [[Paint Creek-Cabin Creek strike of 1912]] in [[Kanawha County, West Virginia]]. The strike had lasted more than a year, and was characterized by deadly clashes between miners and militia hired by the coal companies. The coal companies were successful in having the Federal government declare martial law under a military tribunal, an egregious act according to the editors of the ''Masses''.\n\nThe fact that little had been heard about these occurrences outside of West Virginia troubled those on the magazine's staff. Young's cartoon and Max Eastman's editorial, published in the same issue, claimed the AP had willfully suppressed the facts in order to aid the coal companies. The AP responded in kind with two suits of libel against Eastman and Young on November 1913 and January 1914. Both suits eventually were dropped after Young and Eastman's attorney subpoenaed the records of the AP's Pittsburgh office, possibly out of fear that the testimony and evidence would be damaging after becoming public through the legal proceedings.\n\n===''The Liberator''===\nIn 1918 Young subsequently helped to establish a similar publication to the ''Masses'', the above-mentioned ''Liberator''.  He also served as an illustrator and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] correspondent for ''[[Metropolitan Magazine (New York)|Metropolitan Magazine]]'' (1912\u201317) until the magazine released him due to his outspoken anti-war sentiments. In 1918, Young again ran unsuccessfully for public office on the Socialist ticket, this time for the [[New York State Senate]].\n\nUnhappy with the way that editors Max and Crystal Eastman and a few others were able to live off the struggling magazine, while he received a nominal fee or worked pro bono, Young left ''The Liberator'' in 1919 to start a magazine of his own, ''[[Good Morning (magazine)|Good Morning]]''. This publication was later absorbed by the ''Art Young Quarterly'' in 1922.\n\n===Other publications===\nYoung also contributed illustrations to ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'', ''[[New Leader]]'', ''[[New Masses]]'', ''The Coming Nation'', ''Dawn'', ''The Call'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (after 1930), and ''Big Stick''.  Of the many books he wrote, two, ''On My Way'' (1928) and ''Art Young: His Life and Times'' (1939), are autobiographical.  Of special note are his series of drawings depicting Hell, published in ''[[Cosmopolitan magazine]]'' and in several books, including ''Through Hell With Hiprah Hunt'', available at Google Books.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Through Hell with Hiprah Hunt\n|author=Arthur Henry Young,  Art Young\n|year=1901\n|publisher=Zimmerman's\n|isbn=\n|url=https://archive.org/details/throughhellwith00youngoog\n|quote=hiprah.\n}}</ref> He issued a collection of his drawings, ''The Best of Art Young'', in 1936.\n\n===Legal difficulties===\n====First ''Masses'' Trial====\n[[File:Having Their Fling.jpg|thumb|''Having Their Fling'' by Art Young was brought into court as evidence during the second trial in September/October 1918.]]\nYoung would continue to get himself into legal trouble with his drawings during his years at the ''Masses''. In October 1917, Art Young, [[Max Eastman]], [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], [[Floyd Dell]], Merrill Rogers, and a one-time contributor were charged under the [[Espionage Act]] by the federal government on the charge of conspiracy to obstruct enlistment. The trial began in April the following year and Young was asked to justify his cartoon \"Having Their Fling\" in which four men, an editor, a capitalist, a politician, and a minister are depicted dancing in orgiastic bliss as Satan leads a band of war implements. Young stated he was simply illustrating [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman's]] well-known saying that \"war is hell.\" It seemed appropriate to Young, then, to have Satan as the conductor. The first trial ended in a hung jury. The official tally was 11-1 for conviction.\n\n====Second ''Masses'' Trial====\nThe second trial began in September 1918, and it was as full of humor and irreverence as the first, perhaps more humorous for the historian than for Young. Throughout the trial, Young had the tendency to nap, an act that brought him dangerously close to being charged with contempt of court. Afraid Young would get into more trouble than he already was, his attorneys insisted he be awakened and given a pencil and pad. Young took the pencil and pad and quickly completed a self-portrait. The drawing, \"Art Young on Trial for His Life\", appeared in the ''[[The Liberator (socialist)|Liberator]]'' in June 1918. The cartoon depicted Young slumped in a chair, dozing the trial away.\n\nYoung's propensity for napping worked to the defendant's advantage during the closing arguments. Prosecutor Barnes, wrapped in an American flag and giving a moving speech, told a story of a dead soldier in France. This soldier, Barnes claimed, \"is but one of a thousand whose voices are not silent. He died for you and he died for me. He died for Max Eastman. He died for John Reed. He died for Merrill Rogers. He demands that these men be punished.\"<ref>Fishbein, Leslie. ''Rebels in Bohemia: The Radicals of The'' Masses, 1911-1917. Chapel Hill: U of North Carolina P, 1982. 28. Print.</ref> Roused from his slumber by the impassioned speech, Young exclaimed, \"What! Didn't he die for me too?\" The beautiful oration successfully ruined, the second jury was unable to convict or acquit. Eight jurors voted for acquittal and four for conviction. It would be the last time Young appeared in court for the charges, as they were dropped after failing twice to garner any convictions.\n\n===Death===\nArt Young died on December 29, 1943, at the Hotel Irving in [[New York City]] at age 77.<ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Art Young |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/12/31/archives/art-young.html |quote=Art Young, who died in this city Wednesday night at the age of 77, wouldn't have liked to have it said that he was a lovable soul in spite of his sometimes heterodox opinions.
