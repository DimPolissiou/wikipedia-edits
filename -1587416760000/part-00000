Both the proportions of the limb bones, size and shape of the skull, and size and number of teeth changed as the animals grew. Historically, this has led to various growth stages (including growth stages of related pterosaurs) being mistaken for new species of ''Pterodactylus''. Several detailed studies using various methods to measure growth curves among known specimens have suggested that there is actually only one valid ''Pterodactylus'' species, ''P. antiquus''.<ref name=\"jouve2004\"/>\n\nThe youngest immature ''Pterodactylus antiquus'' specimens (alternately interpreted as young specimens of the distinct species ''P. kochi'') have a small number of teeth (as few as 15), and the teeth have a relatively broad base.<ref name=bennett1996a/> The teeth of other ''P. antiquus'' specimens are both narrower and more numerous (up to 90 teeth are present in some specimens).<ref name=\"jouve2004\"/>\n\n''Pterodactylus'' specimens can be divided into two distinct year classes. In the first year class, the skulls are only 15-45mm (0.59-1.77 inches) in length. The second year class is characterized by skulls 55-95mm (2.16-3.74 inches) long, but still immature. These first two size groups were once classified as juveniles and adults of the species ''P. kochi'', until further study showed that even the supposed \"adults\" were immature, and possibly belong to a distinct genus. A third year class is represented by specimens of the \"traditional\" ''P. antiquus'', as well as a few isolated, large specimens once assigned to ''P. kochi'' that overlap ''P. antiquus'' in size. However, all specimens in this third year class also show sign of immaturity. Fully mature ''Pterodactylus'' specimens remain unknown, or may have been mistakenly classified as a different genus.<ref name=bennett1996a/>\n\n===Growth and breeding seasons===\n[[Image:Pterodactylus grandipelvis Teylers 2.JPG|thumb|Fossil pelvis of a large specimen, referred to the dubious species ''P. grandipelvis'']]\nThe distinct year classes of ''Pterodactylus antiquus'' specimens show that this species, like the contemporary ''Rhamphorhynchus muensteri'', likely bred seasonally and grew consistently during its lifetime. A new generation of 1st year class ''P. antiquus'' would have been produced seasonally, and reached 2nd-year size by the time the next generation hatched, creating distinct 'clumps' of similarly-sized and aged individuals in the fossil record. The smallest size class probably consisted of individuals that had just begun to fly and were less than one year old.<ref name=bennett1996a/><ref name=wellnhofer1970>Wellnhofer, P. (1970).

In March 1800, Hermann alerted the French scientist [[George Cuvier]] to the existence of Collini's fossil, believing that it had been captured by the occupying armies of [[Napoleon]] and sent to the French collections in [[Paris]] (and perhaps to Cuvier himself) as war booty; at the time special French [[political commissar]]s systematically seized art treasures and objects of scientific interest. Hermann sent Cuvier a letter containing his own interpretation of the specimen (though he had not examined it personally), which he believed to be a [[mammal]], including the first known life restoration of a pterosaur. Hermann restored the animal with wing membranes extending from the long fourth finger to the ankle and a covering of fur (neither wing membranes nor fur had been preserved in the specimen). Hermann also added a membrane between the neck and wrist, as is the condition in [[bat]]s. Cuvier agreed with this interpretation, and at Hermann's suggestion, Cuvier became the first to publish these ideas in December 1800 in a very short description.<ref name=\"taquet&padian2004\"/> Cuvier remarked, \"[It is not possible to doubt that the long finger served to support a membrane that, by lengthening the anterior extremity of this animal, formed a good wing.]\"<ref name=\"cuvier1801\">{{Cite journal | author = Cuvier, G. | year = 1801 | title = [Reptile volant].

Rather, in 1802, following the death of Charles Theodore, it was brought to [[Munich]], where Baron [[Johann Paul Carl von Moll]] had obtained a general exemption of confiscation for the Bavarian collections. Cuvier asked von Moll to study the fossil but was informed it could not be found. In 1809 Cuvier published a somewhat longer description, in which he named the animal a \"ptero-dactyle\" and refuted a hypothesis by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] that it would have been a shore bird.\n[[File:Pterodactylus antiquus soemmerring.png|thumb|left|Von Soemmerring's incorrect 1817 restoration of ''[[Pterodactylus brevirostris|P. brevirostris]]'']]\nContrary to von Moll's report, the fossil was not missing; it was being studied by [[Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmerring]], who gave a public lecture about it on 27 December 1810. In January 1811, von S\u00f6mmerring wrote a letter to Cuvier deploring the fact that he had only recently been informed of Cuvier's request for information.

In the first half of the nineteenth century any new pterosaur species would be named ''Pterodactylus'', which thus became a typical \"[[wastebasket taxon]]\". Even after clearly different forms had later been given their own generic name, new species would be created from the very productive late Jurassic German sites, often based on only slightly different material.\n\nAround 1980, subsequent revisions by [[Peter Wellnhofer]] had reduced the number of recognized species to about half a dozen. Many species assigned to ''Pterodactylus'' had been based on juvenile specimens, and subsequently been recognized as immature individuals of other species or genera. By the 1990s it was understood that this was even true for part of the remaining species. ''P. elegans'', for example, was found by numerous studies to be an immature ''[[Ctenochasma]]''.<ref name=\"jouve2004\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1671/0272-4634(2004)024[0542:DOTSOA]2.0.CO;2 | author = Jouve, S. | year = 2004 | title = Description of the skull of a ''Ctenochasma'' (Pterosauria) from the latest Jurassic of eastern France, with a taxonomic revision of European Tithonian Pterodactyloidea | journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 542\u2013554 }}</ref> Another species of ''Pterodactylus'' originally based on small, immature specimens was ''P. micronyx''. However, it has been difficult to determine exactly of what genus and species ''P. micronyx'' might be the juvenile form. St\u00e9phane Jouve, Christopher Bennett and others had once suggested that it probably belonged either to ''[[Gnathosaurus|Gnathosaurus subulatus]]'' or one of the ''Ctenochasma'' species,<ref name =\"bennett2002\"/><ref name=\"jouve2004\"/> though after additional research Bennett assigned it to the genus ''[[Aurorazhdarcho]]''.<ref name=BennettPZ /> Another species with a complex history is ''P. longicollum'', named by von Meyer in 1854, based on a large specimen with a long neck and fewer teeth. Many researchers, including [[David Unwin]], have found ''P. longicollum'' to be distinct from ''P. kochi'' and ''P. antiquus''. Unwin found ''P. longicollum'' to be closer to ''Germanodactylus'' and therefore requiring a new genus name.<ref name=\"unwin2003\"/> It has sometimes been placed in the genus ''[[Diopecephalus]]'' because [[Harry Govier Seeley]] based this genus partly on the ''P. longicollum'' material. However, it was shown by Bennett that the [[type specimen]] later designated for ''Diopecephalus'' was a fossil belonging to ''P. kochi'', and no longer thought to be separate from ''Pterodactylus''. ''Diopecephalus'' is therefore a synonym of ''Pterodactylus'', and as such is unavailable for use as a new genus for \"P.\" ''longicollum''.<ref name=SCB06>{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=S.

However, most studies between 1995 and 2010 found little reason to separate even these two species, and treated them as synonymous.<ref name=\"unwin2003\">Unwin, D. M., (2003). \"On the phylogeny and evolutionary history of pterosaurs\", pp. 139\u2013190. in Buffetaut, E. & Mazin, J.-M., (eds.) (2003). ''Evolution and Palaeobiology of Pterosaurs''. Geological Society of London, Special Publications 217, London, 1\u2013347.</ref><ref name=SCB06/> In 1996, Bennett suggested that the differences between specimens of ''P. kochi'' and ''P. antiquus'' could be explained by differences in age, with ''P. kochi'' (including specimens alternately classified in the species ''P. scolopaciceps'') representing an immature growth stage of ''P. antiquus''. In a 2004 paper, Jouve used a different method of analysis and recovered the same result, showing that the \"distinctive\" features of ''P. kochi'' were age-related, and using mathematical comparison to show that the two forms are different growth stages of the same species.<ref name=\"jouve2004\"/> An additional review of the specimens published in 2013 demonstrated that some of the supposed differences between ''P. kochi'' and ''P. antiquus'' were due to measurement errors, further supporting their synonymy.<ref name=BennettPZ />\n\n===One species or three?===\nBy the 2010s, a large body of research had been developed based on the idea that ''P. kochi'' and ''P. scolopaciceps'' were early growth stages of ''P. antiquus''. However, in 2014, two scientists began publishing research that challenged this paradigm. Steven Vidovic and David Martill concluded that differences between specimens of ''P. kochi'', ''P. scolopaciceps'', and ''P. antiquus'', such as different lengths of neck vertebrae, thinner or thicker teeth, more rounded skulls, and how far the teeth extended back in the jaws, were significant enough to separate them into three distinct species. Vidovic and Martill also performed a phylogenetic analysis which treated all relevant specimens as distinct units, and found that the ''P. kochi'' type specimen did not form a natural group with that of ''P. antiquus''. They concluded that the genus ''Diopecephalus'' could be returned to use to distinguish \"P\". ''kochi'' from ''P. antiquus''. They named the new genus ''[[Aerodactylus]]'' for ''P. scolopaciceps'' as well. So, what Bennett considered early growth stages of one species, Vidovic and Martill considered representatives of new species.<ref name = aerodactylus>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0110646| title = ''Pterodactylus scolopaciceps'' Meyer, 1860 (Pterosauria, Pterodactyloidea) from the Upper Jurassic of Bavaria, Germany: The Problem of Cryptic Pterosaur Taxa in Early Ontogeny| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 9| issue = 10| pages = e110646| year = 2014| last1 = Vidovic | first1 = S.

He claimed that while Vidovic and Martill had identified real differences between the these three groups of specimens, they had not provided any rationale that the differences were enough to distinguish them as species, rather than just individual variation, growth changes, or simply due to crushing and distortion during the fossilization process. Bennett pointed in particular to the data used to distinguish \"''Aerodactylus''\", which was so different from the data for related species, it might be due to an unnatural assemblage of specimens. As a result, Bennett continued to consider ''Diopecephalus'' and ''Aerodactylus'' simply as year-classes of immature ''Pterodactylus antiquus''.<ref name=bennett_2017_pteranodon_juv>Bennett, S.C.

Both the proportions of the limb bones, size and shape of the skull, and size and number of teeth changed as the animals grew. Historically, this has led to various growth stages (including growth stages of related pterosaurs) being mistaken for new species of ''Pterodactylus''. Several detailed studies using various methods to measure growth curves among known specimens have suggested that there is actually only one valid ''Pterodactylus'' species, ''P. antiquus''.<ref name=\"jouve2004\"/>\n\nThe youngest immature ''Pterodactylus antiquus'' specimens (alternately interpreted as young specimens of the distinct species ''P. kochi'') have a small number of teeth (as few as 15), and the teeth have a relatively broad base.<ref name=bennett1996a/> The teeth of other ''P. antiquus'' specimens are both narrower and more numerous (up to 90 teeth are present in some specimens).<ref name=\"jouve2004\"/>\n\n''Pterodactylus'' specimens can be divided into two distinct year classes.

These first two size groups were once classified as juveniles and adults of the species ''P. kochi'', until further study showed that even the supposed \"adults\" were immature, and possibly belong to a distinct genus. A third year class is represented by specimens of the \"traditional\" ''P. antiquus'', as well as a few isolated, large specimens once assigned to ''P. kochi'' that overlap ''P. antiquus'' in size. However, all specimens in this third year class also show sign of immaturity.

A new generation of 1st year class ''P. antiquus'' would have been produced seasonally, and reached 2nd-year size by the time the next generation hatched, creating distinct 'clumps' of similarly-sized and aged individuals in the fossil record.

In March 1800, Hermann alerted the French scientist [[George Cuvier]] to the existence of Collini's fossil, believing that it had been captured by the occupying armies of [[Napoleon]] and sent to the French collections in [[Paris]] (and perhaps to Cuvier himself) as war booty; at the time special French [[political commissar]]s systematically seized art treasures and objects of scientific interest. Hermann sent Cuvier a letter containing his own interpretation of the specimen (though he had not examined it personally), which he believed to be a [[mammal]], including the first known life restoration of a pterosaur. Hermann restored the animal with wing membranes extending from the long fourth finger to the ankle and a covering of fur (neither wing membranes nor fur had been preserved in the specimen). Hermann also added a membrane between the neck and wrist, as is the condition in [[bat]]s. Cuvier agreed with this interpretation, and at Hermann's suggestion, Cuvier became the first to publish these ideas in December 1800 in a very short description.<ref name=\"taquet&padian2004\"/> Cuvier remarked, \"[It is not possible to doubt that the long finger served to support a membrane that, by lengthening the anterior extremity of this animal, formed a good wing.]\"<ref name=\"cuvier1801\">{{Cite journal | author = Cuvier, G. | year = 1801 | title = [Reptile volant].

Cuvier asked von Moll to study the fossil but was informed it could not be found. In 1809 Cuvier published a somewhat longer description, in which he named the animal a \"ptero-dactyle\" and refuted a hypothesis by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] that it would have been a shore bird.\n[[File:Pterodactylus antiquus soemmerring.png|thumb|left|Von Soemmerring's incorrect 1817 restoration of ''[[Pterodactylus brevirostris|P. brevirostris]]'']]\nContrary to von Moll's report, the fossil was not missing; it was being studied by [[Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmerring]], who gave a public lecture about it on 27 December 1810.

In the first half of the nineteenth century any new pterosaur species would be named ''Pterodactylus'', which thus became a typical \"[[wastebasket taxon]]\". Even after clearly different forms had later been given their own generic name, new species would be created from the very productive late Jurassic German sites, often based on only slightly different material.\n\nAround 1980, subsequent revisions by [[Peter Wellnhofer]] had reduced the number of recognized species to about half a dozen. Many species assigned to ''Pterodactylus'' had been based on juvenile specimens, and subsequently been recognized as immature individuals of other species or genera. By the 1990s it was understood that this was even true for part of the remaining species. ''P. elegans'', for example, was found by numerous studies to be an immature ''[[Ctenochasma]]''.<ref name=\"jouve2004\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1671/0272-4634(2004)024[0542:DOTSOA]2.0.CO;2 | author = Jouve, S. | year = 2004 | title = Description of the skull of a ''Ctenochasma'' (Pterosauria) from the latest Jurassic of eastern France, with a taxonomic revision of European Tithonian Pterodactyloidea | journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 542\u2013554 }}</ref> Another species of ''Pterodactylus'' originally based on small, immature specimens was ''P. micronyx''. However, it has been difficult to determine exactly of what genus and species ''P. micronyx'' might be the juvenile form.

Many researchers, including [[David Unwin]], have found ''P. longicollum'' to be distinct from ''P. kochi'' and ''P. antiquus''. Unwin found ''P. longicollum'' to be closer to ''Germanodactylus'' and therefore requiring a new genus name.<ref name=\"unwin2003\"/> It has sometimes been placed in the genus ''[[Diopecephalus]]'' because [[Harry Govier Seeley]] based this genus partly on the ''P. longicollum'' material. However, it was shown by Bennett that the [[type specimen]] later designated for ''Diopecephalus'' was a fossil belonging to ''P. kochi'', and no longer thought to be separate from ''Pterodactylus''.

In a 2004 paper, Jouve used a different method of analysis and recovered the same result, showing that the \"distinctive\" features of ''P. kochi'' were age-related, and using mathematical comparison to show that the two forms are different growth stages of the same species.<ref name=\"jouve2004\"/> An additional review of the specimens published in 2013 demonstrated that some of the supposed differences between ''P. kochi'' and ''P. antiquus'' were due to measurement errors, further supporting their synonymy.<ref name=BennettPZ />\n\n===One species or three?===\nBy the 2010s, a large body of research had been developed based on the idea that ''P. kochi'' and ''P. scolopaciceps'' were early growth stages of ''P. antiquus''. However, in 2014, two scientists began publishing research that challenged this paradigm. Steven Vidovic and David Martill concluded that differences between specimens of ''P. kochi'', ''P. scolopaciceps'', and ''P. antiquus'', such as different lengths of neck vertebrae, thinner or thicker teeth, more rounded skulls, and how far the teeth extended back in the jaws, were significant enough to separate them into three distinct species. Vidovic and Martill also performed a phylogenetic analysis which treated all relevant specimens as distinct units, and found that the ''P. kochi'' type specimen did not form a natural group with that of ''P. antiquus''. They concluded that the genus ''Diopecephalus'' could be returned to use to distinguish \"P\". ''kochi'' from ''P. antiquus''. They named the new genus ''[[Aerodactylus]]'' for ''P. scolopaciceps'' as well. So, what Bennett considered early growth stages of one species, Vidovic and Martill considered representatives of new species.<ref name = aerodactylus>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0110646| title = ''Pterodactylus scolopaciceps'' Meyer, 1860 (Pterosauria, Pterodactyloidea) from the Upper Jurassic of Bavaria, Germany: The Problem of Cryptic Pterosaur Taxa in Early Ontogeny| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 9| issue = 10| pages = e110646| year = 2014| last1 = Vidovic | first1 = S.

He claimed that while Vidovic and Martill had identified real differences between the these three groups of specimens, they had not provided any rationale that the differences were enough to distinguish them as species, rather than just individual variation, growth changes, or simply due to crushing and distortion during the fossilization process. Bennett pointed in particular to the data used to distinguish \"''Aerodactylus''\", which was so different from the data for related species, it might be due to an unnatural assemblage of specimens.

Cut to high school, when I was scared out of my mind of science and avoided science like the plague, and I don't think that I was really well-prepared for that dream. I found out later that you have to study rocks and dirt and all sorts of things that I didn't care about.

Over the course of the battle, the Loyalist fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelist fleet and lacking any [[ships of the line]] when compared to the Miguelist four, managed to close with the Miguelists, [[naval boarding|board]] their ships and engage in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelist fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelist fleet. \n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelist crews proved no match for the Loyalist crews, most of them being former [[Royal Navy]] personnel that had been discharged and sought service under [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Four ships of the line, one [[frigate]] and one [[corvette]] was captured, and the remainder of the Miguelist fleet retreated. The action took place in context of the [[Liberal Wars]], a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a [[pretender]] named [[Don Miguel]], whose supporters were called [[Miguelist|Miguelites]].  The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelist fleet at Cape St.Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the [[Battle of the Tagus]] on 11 July 1831 against a [[July Monarchy|French]] fleet led by [[Albin Roussin]]. The Miguelist-held [[Lisbon]], deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.\n\n==Background==\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the [[Azores]], Napier had become acquainted with some exiled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Liberalism|liberals]], who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Loyalist Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as Admiral of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in [[English language|English]], was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when he captured the French-held island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off [[Oporto]]. \n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as Vice Admiral, Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'', commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the total armed forces available to the Loyalists to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelists forces and march on and capture [[Lisbon]]. After successfully disembarking this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelist admiral Manuel Marreiros off [[Cape St. Vincent]] on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelist fleet.\n\n==The battle==\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier\u2019s force was positions to engage the Miguelist fleet. The Miguelist fleet significantly outnumbered the Loyalist one, and aimed to defeat the Loyalists via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as tugs, but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] fleet which consisted four [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns. \n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelist vessels and attempt to board and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his flagship leading the manoeuvre, the Loyalist fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelist fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelists desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Loyalist victory was that the majority of the Loyalist crews were British veterans from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelist fleet. In the battle the Loyalist forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Loyalist cause and swear allegiance to [[Don Pedro]]. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed (including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains) and about 60 wounded (including Charles Elers Napier), against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelist fleet, including the Admiral, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros. \n\n==Aftermath==\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by [[cholera]] outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelist fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Loyalist fleet and the captured Miguelist prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelistas had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]], a major Loyalist victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the [[peerage of Portugal]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the Navy List at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews , was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the height of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]]. \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent in the [[Peerage of Portugal]]. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelist ''The Lord of the Isles'' steamer at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Loyalist cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Loyalist and Miguelist armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Loyalist victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelist army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he passed away on September 24, 1834. Maria da Gl\u00f3ria resumed her interrupted reign as [[Maria II of Portugal]], until she finally passed away in 1853.\n\nAfter the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the restored Portuguese parliament. Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth parliamentary seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834. He then occupied himself until 1836 with writing a history of the Portuguese War and his own part in it.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n\n=== Loyalist fleet (Charles Napier) ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

'''Battle of Cape St Vincent''' was a naval encounter off [[Cape St. Vincent]] between a Loyalist fleet under the command of British naval officer [[Charles Napier (naval officer)|Charles Napier]] against a [[Miguelist]] fleet under the command of Portugese naval officer Manuel Marreiros, which was fought on 5 July 1833 during the [[Liberal Wars]] and resulted in a decisive victory for the Loyalist fleet. Over the course of the battle, the Loyalist fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelist fleet and lacking any [[ships of the line]] when compared to the Miguelist four, managed to close with the Miguelists, [[naval boarding|board]] their ships and engage in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelist fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelist fleet. \n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelist crews proved no match for the Loyalist crews, most of them being former [[Royal Navy]] personnel that had been discharged and sought service under [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Four ships of the line, one [[frigate]] and one [[corvette]] was captured, and the remainder of the Miguelist fleet retreated. The action took place in context of the [[Liberal Wars]], a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a [[pretender]] named [[Don Miguel]], whose supporters were called [[Miguelist|Miguelites]].  The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelist fleet at Cape St.Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the [[Battle of the Tagus]] on 11 July 1831 against a [[July Monarchy|French]] fleet led by [[Albin Roussin]]. The Miguelist-held [[Lisbon]], deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.\n\n==Background==\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the [[Azores]], Napier had become acquainted with some exiled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Liberalism|liberals]], who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Loyalist Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as Admiral of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in [[English language|English]], was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when he captured the French-held island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off [[Oporto]]. \n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as Vice Admiral, Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'', commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the total armed forces available to the Loyalists to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelists forces and march on and capture [[Lisbon]]. After successfully disembarking this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelist admiral Manuel Marreiros off [[Cape St. Vincent]] on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelist fleet.\n\n==The battle==\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier\u2019s force was positions to engage the Miguelist fleet. The Miguelist fleet significantly outnumbered the Loyalist one, and aimed to defeat the Loyalists via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as tugs, but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] fleet which consisted four [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns. \n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelist vessels and attempt to board and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his flagship leading the manoeuvre, the Loyalist fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelist fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelists desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Loyalist victory was that the majority of the Loyalist crews were British veterans from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelist fleet. In the battle the Loyalist forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Loyalist cause and swear allegiance to [[Don Pedro]]. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed (including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains) and about 60 wounded (including Charles Elers Napier), against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelist fleet, including the Admiral, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros. \n\n==Aftermath==\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by [[cholera]] outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelist fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Loyalist fleet and the captured Miguelist prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelistas had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]], a major Loyalist victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the [[peerage of Portugal]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the Navy List at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews , was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the height of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]]. \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent in the [[Peerage of Portugal]]. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelist ''The Lord of the Isles'' steamer at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Loyalist cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Loyalist and Miguelist armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Loyalist victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelist army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he died September 24, 1834. Maria da Gl\u00f3ria resumed her interrupted reign as [[Maria II of Portugal]], until she passed away in 1853.\n\nAfter the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the restored Portuguese parliament. Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth parliamentary seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834. He then occupied himself until 1836 with writing a history of the Portuguese War and his own part in it.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n\n=== Loyalist fleet (Charles Napier) ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233534126|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat&hl=en|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ standing rigging to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the galley (kitchen). A cruising yacht is likely to have a head (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such power is inboard on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63125961|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n==Racing==\n{{Under construction|section=Description|placedby=HopsonRoad}}\nWorld Sailing recognizes nine classes of racing yacht:<ref>[http://www.sailing.org/classes/#isaf_sliding_tab_item_classes_index_yacht World Sailing classes of yachts].</ref>\n\n#[[Class40]]\n#[[Farr 30]]\n#[[Farr 40]]\n#[[International Maxi Association]]\n#[[J/111]]\n#[[IMOCA 60]]\n#[[Soto 40]]\n#[[Swan 45]]\n#[[Swan 60]]\n#[[TP 52]]\n#[[X-35 (yacht)|X-35]]\n#[[X-41 (yacht)|X-41]]\n\n==See also==\n{{commonscat-inline|Sailing yachts}}\n*[[Dinghy sailing]]\n*[[International class]]\n*[[List of large sailing yachts]]\n*[[Skiff|Sailing skiff]]\n{{International Sailing Federation Classes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[Category:Sailing yachts]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n | title = Sailing yachts\n\n | image1 = 2013_Ahmanson_Cup_Regatta_yacht_Zapata_II_b_photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg\n | alt1 = A cruising yacht\n | caption1 = A {{Convert|50|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} cruising yacht\n\n | image2 = 60feet IMOCA SAFRAN 01.JPG\n | alt2 = A racing yacht\n | caption2 = A {{Convert|60|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[IMOCA 60|IMOCA]] ocean racing yacht\n\n | footer = Cruising and racing yachts embody different tradeoffs between comfort and performance.\n}}\n\nA '''sailing yacht''' (US ship prefixes SY or S/Y), is a leisure craft that uses sails as its primary means of propulsion.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233534126|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat&hl=en|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ standing rigging to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the galley (kitchen). A cruising yacht is likely to have a head (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such power is inboard on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63125961|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n==Racing==\n{{Under construction|section=Description|placedby=HopsonRoad}}\nWorld Sailing recognizes nine classes of racing yacht:<ref>[http://www.sailing.org/classes/#isaf_sliding_tab_item_classes_index_yacht World Sailing classes of yachts].</ref>\n\n#[[Class40]]\n#[[Farr 30]]\n#[[Farr 40]]\n#[[International Maxi Association]]\n#[[J/111]]\n#[[IMOCA 60]]\n#[[Soto 40]]\n#[[Swan 45]]\n#[[Swan 60]]\n#[[TP 52]]\n#[[X-35 (yacht)|X-35]]\n#[[X-41 (yacht)|X-41]]\n\n==See also==\n{{commonscat-inline|Sailing yachts}}\n*[[Dinghy sailing]]\n*[[International class]]\n*[[List of large sailing yachts]]\n*[[Skiff|Sailing skiff]]\n{{International Sailing Federation Classes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[Category:Sailing yachts]]\n", "name_user": "HopsonRoad", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:url", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing_yacht"}

Suneson said he had procured SMSes of his crew: one from his bodyguard about different versions of events, and another from an assistant showing they had uploaded edited videos on Instagram and asking Mayers to destroy everything on his cellphone. The DNA on the bottle allegedly used in the assault was also analyzed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/OpmlK1/asap-rocky-to-face-trial-in-assault-case |title=ASAP Rocky to face trial in assault case |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=July 25, 2019|accessdate=July 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJafari told the police that he first approached Mayers' entourage to ask if they had seen his missing friend, not knowing who they were, but was told by the guard to go away, and then pushed.

The Graduate School focuses on studies and research that are relevant to the Air Force mission as well as the needs of the defense establishment as a whole. AFIT's Aeronautics & Astronautics Department has graduated nine U. S. astronauts including [[Guion Bluford|Guy Bluford]] (PhD 1978), first African-American astronaut.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Graduate School of Engineering and Management|url=http://www.afit.edu/EN/aboutgradschool.cfm|publisher=USAF|accessdate=25 July 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026112041/http://www.afit.edu/en/aboutgradschool.cfm | archivedate = 26 October 2013| url-status=live}}</ref> Since graduate degrees were first granted in 1956, AFIT has awarded 19,619 master's and 898 doctor of philosophy degrees.\n\n=== Students ===\n[[File:AFIT Graduation.jpg|thumb|An AFIT graduation ceremony]]\nThe Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) enrolls over 700 full-time graduate students.

Selection of officers for graduate education is fully funded by their service and is based upon outstanding professional performance as an officer, promotion potential, and a strong academic background. Admission of non-Government affiliated civilians is based on academic preparation and requires U.S. citizenship. A substantial number of AFIT graduates are assigned to AFRL and NASIC upon graduation from AFIT. Many of the AFIT student thesis projects are influenced directly or indirectly by AFRL, NASIC, NRO and other Air Force and defense agencies.\n\n=== Faculty ===\nThe faculty body consists of approximately a 50\u201350 mix of military and civilian members all of whom hold a PhD in their fields.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The faculty to student ratio is typically 1 to 5 in the master's degree programs.\n\n=== Accreditation ===\nAFIT is accredited by [[the Higher Learning Commission]] of the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]], 30 North LaSalle Street, Suite 2400, Chicago, Illinois 60602-2504 to offer degrees to the doctorate level. Eight engineering programs in the Graduate School of Engineering and Management are accredited at the advanced level by the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET).\n\n=== Academic calendar ===\nThe Institute operates year-round on a quarter calendar which includes the Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer terms. The quarters are 10 weeks in length plus a week for examinations. Typically, the Fall term begins in late September and ends in mid-December; the Winter term begins in early January and ends in mid-March; the Spring term begins in late March and ends in mid-June; and the Summer term begins in late June and ends in early-September.\n\n=== Cost ===\nThe educational expenses for full-time military students assigned to AFIT are paid by their respective uniformed service. For tuition-paying students, the approximate cost is $6,420 per quarter for full-time enrollment (based on 12 quarter hours and a tuition rate of $535 per quarter-hour). AFIT is tuition-waived for civilian employees of the Department of Defense.\n\n=== Civilian Institution Programs ===\nThrough its Civilian Institution Programs, AFIT also manages the educational programs of officers enrolled in civilian universities, research centers, hospitals, and industrial organizations. Air Force students attending civilian institutions have earned more than 12,000 undergraduate and graduate degrees in the past twenty years.\n\n== Notable AFIT alumni ==\n* [[George Abbey|George W.S.

It also provides its own dialect of [[ECMAScript]] called [[JScript]].\n\nInternet Explorer was criticised by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] for its limited support for SVG, which is promoted by [[W3C]].<ref name=\"TBLcrit\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/26646919|title=Creator of Web spots a flaw in Internet Explorer|last=Svensson|first=Peter|date=September 10, 2008|website=NBC News|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Non-standard extensions===\nInternet Explorer has introduced an array of proprietary extensions to many of the standards, including HTML, CSS, and the DOM.  This has resulted in a number of web pages that appear broken in standards-compliant web browsers and has introduced the need for a \"quirks mode\" to allow for rendering improper elements meant for Internet Explorer in these other browsers.\n\nInternet Explorer has introduced a number of extensions to the DOM that have been adopted by other browsers. \n\nThese include the innerHTML property, which provides access to the HTML string within an element, which was part of IE 5 and was standardized as part of HTML 5 roughly 15 years later after all other browsers implemented it for compatibility<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xul.fr/en/html5/innerhtml.php|title=innerHTML and compatibility|website=www.xul.fr}}</ref>, the XMLHttpRequest object, which allows the sending of HTTP request and receiving of HTTP response, and may be used to perform [[AJAX]], and the designMode attribute of the contentDocument object, which enables rich text editing of HTML documents.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Some of these functionalities were not possible until the introduction of the W3C DOM methods. Its [[Ruby character]] extension to HTML is also accepted as a module in W3C XHTML 1.1, though it is not found in all versions of W3C HTML.\n\nMicrosoft submitted several other features of IE for consideration by the W3C for standardization. These include the 'behaviour' CSS property, which connects the HTML elements with JScript behaviours (known as HTML Components, HTC); [[HTMLplusTIME|HTML+TIME]] profile, which adds timing and media synchronization support to HTML documents (similar to the W3C [[XHTMLplusSMIL|XHTML+SMIL]]), and the [[VML]] [[vector graphics]] file format. However, all were rejected, at least in their original forms; VML was subsequently combined with [[PGML]] (proposed by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]), resulting in the W3C-approved SVG format, one of the few vector image formats being used on the web, which IE did not support until version 9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codedread.com/svg-support.php|title=SVG Support Tables|last=Schiller|first=Jeff|work=codedread.com|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther non-standard behaviours include: support for vertical text, but in a syntax different from W3C CSS3 candidate recommendation, support for a variety of image effects<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webfx.eae.net/tools/filtertool.html |title=Filter Tool (WebFX) |author= |date=May 12, 2005 |publisher=webfx.eae.net |accessdate=}}</ref> and page transitions, which are not found in W3C CSS, support for [[obfuscated code|obfuscated]] script code, in particular [[JScript.Encode]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions//cbfz3598(v=vs.85)|title=Using Script Encoder|date=October 24, 2011|work=Microsoft Docs|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> as well as support for [[font embedding|embedding]] [[Embedded OpenType|EOT]] fonts in [[Font embedding on the Web|web pages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/default.aspx|title=Font Embedding for the Web|date=February 26, 2001|work=Microsoft Typography|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428064515/http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/default.aspx|archive-date=April 28, 2005|url-status=|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Favicon===\nSupport for [[favicon]]s was first added in Internet Explorer 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537656(VS.85).aspx|title=How to Add a Shortcut Icon to a Web Page|work=[[MSDN]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217122653/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537656(VS.85).aspx|archive-date=December 17, 2008|url-status=|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> Internet Explorer supports favicons in [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], static [[GIF]] and [[ICO (file format)|native Windows icon]] formats.

Tabbed browsing can also be added to older versions by installing [[MSN Search Toolbar]] or [[Yahoo Toolbar]].\n\n===Cache===\n{{Main|Temporary Internet Files|Index.dat}}\n\nInternet Explorer caches visited content in the [[Temporary Internet Files]] folder to allow quicker access (or offline access) to previously visited pages.

Multiple Index.dat files exist which index different content\u2014visited content, [[web feed]]s, visited [[URL]]s, cookies, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/archive/2006/08/04/WinInet_Index_dat.aspx|title=A bit about WinInet's Index.dat|author=Windows Core Networking Team|date=August 4, 2006|website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112205144/http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/archive/2006/08/04/WinInet_Index_dat.aspx|archive-date=January 12, 2008|url-status=|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPrior to IE7, clearing the cache used to clear the index but the files themselves were not reliably removed, posing a potential security and privacy risk. In IE7 and later, when the cache is cleared, the cache files are more reliably removed, and the index.dat file is overwritten with null bytes.\n\nCaching has been improved in IE9.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2011/03/17/internet-explorer-9-network-performance-improvements/|title=Internet Explorer 9 Network Performance Improvements|date=March 17, 2011|website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Group Policy===\n{{Main|Group Policy}}\nInternet Explorer is fully configurable using [[Group Policy]].  Administrators of [[Windows Server domain]]s (for domain-joined computers) or the local computer can apply and enforce a variety of settings on computers that affect the user interface (such as disabling menu items and individual configuration options), as well as underlying security features such as downloading of files, zone configuration, per-site settings, ActiveX control behaviour and others.  Policy settings can be configured for each user and for each machine. Internet Explorer also supports [[Integrated Windows Authentication]].\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:IExplore.svg|thumb|right|The architecture of IE8. Previous versions had a similar architecture, except that both tabs and the UI were within the same process. Consequently, each browser window could have only one \"tab process\".]]\nInternet Explorer uses a [[software componentry|componentized]] architecture built on the [[Component Object Model]] (COM) technology. It consists of several major components, each of which is contained in a separate [[Dynamic-link library]] (DLL) and exposes a set of COM [[interface (computing)|programming interfaces]] hosted by the Internet Explorer main executable, {{samp|iexplore.exe}}:<ref name=\"architecture\">{{cite web|url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa741312.aspx |title = Internet Explorer Architecture | publisher = [[MSDN]] |accessdate = January 10, 2007}}</ref>\n* {{samp|WinInet.dll}} is the protocol handler for [[HTTP]], [[HTTPS]] and [[FTP]]. It handles all network communication over these protocols.\n* {{samp|URLMon.dll}} is responsible for MIME-type handling and download of web content, and provides a thread-safe wrapper around WinInet.dll and other protocol implementations.\n* {{samp|MSHTML.dll}} houses the [[Trident (rendering engine)|Trident]] [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering engine]] introduced in Internet Explorer 4, which is responsible for displaying the pages on-screen and handling the Document Object Model of the web pages. MSHTML.dll parses the HTML/CSS file and creates the internal DOM tree representation of it. It also exposes a set of [[API]]s for runtime inspection and modification of the DOM tree.  The DOM tree is further processed by a layout engine which then renders the internal representation on screen.\n* {{samp|IEFrame.dll}} contains the user interface and window of IE in Internet Explorer 7 and above.\n* {{samp|ShDocVw.dll}} provides the navigation, local caching and history functionalities for the browser.\n* {{samp|BrowseUI.dll}} is responsible for rendering the browser user interface such as menus and toolbars.<ref>{{cite web| first = Chris |last = Wilson | publisher = MSDN Channel9 | accessdate = March 7, 2008 | url = http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=388331 | title = Inside IE8 Beta 1 for Developers}}</ref>\n\nInternet Explorer does not include any native scripting functionality. Rather, {{samp|MSHTML.dll}} exposes an API that permits a programmer to develop a scripting environment to be plugged-in and to access the DOM tree. Internet Explorer 8 includes the bindings for the [[Active Scripting]] engine, which is a part of [[Microsoft Windows]] and allows any language implemented as an Active Scripting module to be used for client-side scripting. By default, only the JScript and [[VBScript]] modules are provided; third party implementations like [[ScreamingMonkey]] (for ECMAScript 4 support) can also be used. Microsoft also makes available the [[Microsoft Silverlight]] runtime (not supported in [[Windows RT]]) that allows [[CLI languages]], including [[Dynamic Language Runtime|DLR]]-based dynamic languages like [[IronPython]] and [[IronRuby]], to be used for client-side scripting.\n\nInternet Explorer 8 introduces some major architectural changes, called ''Loosely Coupled IE'' (LCIE). LCIE separates the main window process (frame process) from the processes hosting the different web applications in different tabs (tab processes). A frame process can create multiple tab processes, each of which can be of a different [[Mandatory Integrity Control|integrity level]]; each tab process can host multiple web sites. The processes use asynchronous [[Inter-Process Communication]] to synchronize themselves. Generally, there will be a single frame process for all web sites. In [[Windows Vista]] with Protected Mode turned on, however, opening privileged content (such as local HTML pages) will create a new tab process as it will not be constrained by Protected Mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2008/03/11/ie8-and-loosely-coupled-ie-lcie/|title=IE8 and Loosely Coupled IE|last=Zeigler|first=Andy|date=March 11, 2008|website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Extensibility==\nInternet Explorer exposes a set of Component Object Model (COM) interfaces that allows [[Plug-in (computing)|add-ons]] to extend the functionality of the browser.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> Extensibility is divided into two types: Browser extensibility and content extensibility. Browser extensibility involves adding context menu entries, toolbars, menu items or [[Browser Helper Objects]] (BHO). BHOs are used to extend the feature set of the browser, whereas the other extensibility options are used to expose that feature in the user interface. Content extensibility adds support for non-native content formats.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> It allows Internet Explorer to handle new [[file format]]s and new [[network protocol|protocols]], e.g. [[WebM]] or SPDY.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> In addition, web pages can integrate [[software widget|widgets]] known as ActiveX controls which run on Windows only but have vast potentials to extend the content capabilities; [[Adobe Flash Player]] and Microsoft Silverlight are examples.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> Add-ons can be installed either locally, or directly by a web site.\n\nSince malicious add-ons can compromise the security of a system, Internet Explorer implements several safeguards. Internet Explorer 6 with Service Pack 2 and later feature an Add-on Manager for enabling or disabling individual add-ons, complemented by a \"No Add-Ons\" mode. [[Security and safety features new to Windows Vista#Application isolation|Starting with Windows Vista]], Internet Explorer and its BHOs run with restricted privileges and are isolated from the rest of the system. Internet Explorer 9 introduced a new component&nbsp;\u2013 Add-on Performance Advisor. Add-on Performance Advisor shows a notification when one or more of installed add-ons exceed a pre-set performance threshold. The notification appears in the Notification Bar when the user launches the browser. Windows 8 and Windows RT introduce a [[Metro-style app|Metro-style version]] of Internet Explorer that is entirely sandboxed and does not run add-ons at all.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/australian-technology/a-look-at-internet-explorer-10-on-windows-rt/|title = A look at Internet Explorer 10 on Windows RT|date = January 20, 2013|accessdate = |website = [[TechRepublic]]|publisher = [[CBS Interactive]]|last = McSherry|first = Tony}}</ref> In addition, Windows RT cannot download or install ActiveX controls at all; although existing ones bundled with Windows RT still run in the traditional version of Internet Explorer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nInternet Explorer itself can be hosted by other applications via a set of COM interfaces. This can be used to embed the browser functionality inside a computer program or create [[Internet Explorer shell]]s.<ref name=\"architecture\" />\n\n==Security==\n{{See also|Browser security}}\nInternet Explorer uses a zone-based [[computer security|security]] framework that groups sites based on certain conditions, including whether it is an Internet- or intranet-based site as well as a user-editable whitelist. Security restrictions are applied per zone; all the sites in a zone are subject to the restrictions.\n\nInternet Explorer 6 SP2 onwards uses the ''Attachment Execution Service'' of Microsoft Windows to mark executable files downloaded from the Internet as being potentially unsafe. Accessing files marked as such will prompt the user to make an explicit trust decision to execute the file, as executables originating from the Internet can be potentially unsafe. This helps in preventing accidental installation of malware.\n\nInternet Explorer 7 introduced the phishing filter, that restricts access to [[phishing]] sites unless the user overrides the decision. With version 8, it also blocks access to sites known to host [[malware]]. Downloads are also checked to see if they are known to be malware-infected.\n\nIn Windows Vista, Internet Explorer by default runs in what is called ''Protected Mode'', where the privileges of the browser itself are severely restricted\u2014it cannot make any system-wide changes. One can optionally turn this mode off but this is not recommended. This also effectively restricts the privileges of any add-ons. As a result, even if the browser or any add-on is compromised, the damage the security breach can cause is limited.\n\nPatches and updates to the browser are released periodically and made available through the Windows Update service, as well as through Automatic Updates. Although security patches continue to be released for a range of platforms, most feature additions and security infrastructure improvements are only made available on operating systems which are in Microsoft's mainstream support phase.\n\nOn December 16, 2008, [[Trend Micro]] recommended users switch to rival browsers until an emergency patch was released to fix a potential security risk which \"could allow outside users to take control of a person's computer and steal their passwords\". Microsoft representatives countered this recommendation, claiming that \"0.02% of internet sites\" were affected by the flaw. A fix for the issue was released the following day with the Security Update for Internet Explorer KB960714, on Microsoft Windows Update.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/world/north-america/security-risk-detected-in-internet-explorer-software-14110209.html |title=Security risk detected in Internet Explorer software |date=December 16, 2008 |newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7784908.stm |newspaper=BBC News | title=Serious security flaw found in IE | date=December 16, 2008 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Germany's Federal Office for Information Security, known by its German initials, BSI, advised \"temporary use of alternative browsers\" because of a \"critical security hole\" in Microsoft's software that could allow hackers to remotely plant and run malicious code on Windows PCs. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Business Technology: Microsoft's Internet Explorer Is Under Fire in Europe|last=Wingfield|first=Nick|date=January 19, 2010|work=The Wall Street Journal|last2=McGroarty|first2=Patrick}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, a report by Accuvant, funded by Google, rated the security (based on sandboxing) of Internet Explorer worse than [[Google Chrome]] but better than [[Mozilla Firefox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/12/09/chrome_ie_firefox_security_bakeoff|title=Chrome is the most secured browser \u2013 new study|website=The Register|first=Dan|last=Goodin|date=December 9, 2011|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Accuvant Study Finds Chrome is Most Secure Browser|url=http://www.esecurityplanet.com/browser-security/accuvant-study-finds-chrome-is-most-secure-browser.html|date=December 13, 2011|publisher=eSecurity Planet|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nA 2017 browser security white paper comparing Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and [[Internet Explorer 11]] by X41 D-Sec in 2017 came to similar conclusions, also based on sandboxing and support of legacy web technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://browser-security.x41-dsec.de/X41-Browser-Security-White-Paper.pdf|title=Browser Security White Paper|publisher=X41-Dsec GmbH|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Security vulnerabilities===\n{{See also|Comparison of web browsers#Security and vulnerabilities}}\nInternet Explorer has been subjected to many security vulnerabilities and concerns:<!-- Now, in one sentence, we answer how the security issues, enumerated and detailed ELSEWHERE, affect people such that the volume of criticism for IE is unusually high --> much of the [[spyware]], [[adware]], and [[computer virus]]es across the Internet are made possible by exploitable bugs and flaws in the security architecture of Internet Explorer, sometimes requiring nothing more than viewing of a malicious web page in order to install themselves. This is known as a \"[[drive-by download|drive-by install]]\". There are also attempts to trick the user into installing malicious software by misrepresenting the software's true purpose in the description section of an ActiveX security alert.\n\nA number of security flaws affecting IE originated not in the browser itself, but ActiveX-based add-ons used by it. Because the add-ons have the same privilege as IE, the flaws can be as critical as browser flaws. This has led to the ActiveX-based architecture being criticized for being fault-prone. By 2005, some experts maintained that the dangers of ActiveX have been overstated and there were safeguards in place.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/The-Lame-Blame-of-ActiveX/\n|title=The Lame Blame of ActiveX\n|date=April 14, 2005\n|accessdate=April 7, 2006\n|work = Security\u2014Opinions\n|publisher=eWeek\n|last=Seltzer\n|first=Larry\n}}</ref> In 2006, new techniques using [[automated testing]] found more than a hundred vulnerabilities in standard Microsoft ActiveX components.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11403\n|title=ActiveX security faces storm before calm\n|date=July 31, 2006\n|accessdate=July 11, 2009\n|publisher=Security Focus\n|last=Lemos\n|first=Robert\n}}</ref> Security features introduced in Internet Explorer 7 mitigated some of these vulnerabilities.\n\nIn 2008, Internet Explorer had a number of published security vulnerabilities.

browsers]] according to [[StatCounter]] ]]\n[[File:Internet-explorer-usage-data.svg|thumb|left|300px|Historical market share of Internet Explorer]]\n\nThe adoption rate of Internet Explorer seems to be closely related to that of Microsoft Windows, as it is the default web browser that comes with Windows. Since the integration of Internet Explorer 2.0 with Windows 95 OSR 1 in 1996, and especially after version 4.0's release in 1997, the adoption was greatly accelerated: from below 20% in 1996, to about 40% in 1998, and over 80% in 2000. This made Microsoft the winner in the infamous '[[first browser war]]' against Netscape. [[Netscape Navigator]] was the dominant browser during 1995 and until 1997, but rapidly lost share to IE starting in 1998, and eventually slipped behind in 1999. The integration of IE with Windows led to a lawsuit by [[AOL]], Netscape's owner, accusing Microsoft of unfair competition. The infamous case was eventually won by AOL but by then it was too late, as Internet Explorer had already become the dominant browser.\n\nInternet Explorer peaked during 2002 and 2003, with about 95% share.

Because of the use of COM, it is possible to embed web-browsing functionality in third-party applications. Hence, there are a number of Internet Explorer shells, and a number of content-centric applications like [[RealPlayer]] also use Internet Explorer's web browsing module for viewing web pages within the applications.\n\n==Removal==\n{{Main|Removal of Internet Explorer}}\nWhile a major upgrade of Internet Explorer can be uninstalled in a traditional way if the user has saved the original application files for installation, the matter of uninstalling the version of the browser that has shipped with an operating system remains a controversial one.\n\nThe idea of removing a stock install of Internet Explorer from a Windows system was proposed during the ''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)|United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'' case. One of Microsoft's arguments during the trial was that removing Internet Explorer from Windows may result in system instability. Indeed, programs that depend on libraries installed by IE, including Windows help and support system, fail to function without IE. Before Windows Vista, it was not possible to run [[Windows Update]] without IE because the service used ActiveX technology, which no other web browser supports.\n\n==Impersonation by malware==\nThe popularity of Internet Explorer has led to the appearance of malware abusing its name. On January 28, 2011, a fake Internet Explorer browser calling itself \"Internet Explorer \u2013 Emergency Mode\" appeared. It closely resembles the real Internet Explorer, but has fewer buttons and no search bar. If a user attempts to launch any other browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] or the real Internet Explorer, this browser will be loaded instead. It also displays a fake error message, claiming that the computer is infected with malware and Internet Explorer has entered \"Emergency Mode\". It blocks access to legitimate sites such as [[Google]] if the user tries to access them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.im-infected.com/hijacker/internet-explorer-emergency-mode.html |title=IE

It also provides its own dialect of [[ECMAScript]] called [[JScript]].\n\nInternet Explorer was criticised by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] for its limited support for SVG, which is promoted by [[W3C]].<ref name=\"TBLcrit\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/26646919|title=Creator of Web spots a flaw in Internet Explorer|last=Svensson|first=Peter|date=September 10, 2008|website=NBC News|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Non-standard extensions===\nInternet Explorer has introduced an array of proprietary extensions to many of the standards, including HTML, CSS, and the DOM.  This has resulted in a number of web pages that appear broken in standards-compliant web browsers and has introduced the need for a \"quirks mode\" to allow for rendering improper elements meant for Internet Explorer in these other browsers.\n\nInternet Explorer has introduced a number of extensions to the DOM that have been adopted by other browsers. \n\nThese include the innerHTML property, which provides access to the HTML string within an element, which was part of IE 5 and was standardized as part of HTML 5 roughly 15 years later after all other browsers implemented it for compatibility<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xul.fr/en/html5/innerhtml.php|title=innerHTML and compatibility|website=www.xul.fr}}</ref>, the XMLHttpRequest object, which allows the sending of HTTP request and receiving of HTTP response, and may be used to perform [[AJAX]], and the designMode attribute of the contentDocument object, which enables rich text editing of HTML documents.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Some of these functionalities were not possible until the introduction of the W3C DOM methods. Its [[Ruby character]] extension to HTML is also accepted as a module in W3C XHTML 1.1, though it is not found in all versions of W3C HTML.\n\nMicrosoft submitted several other features of IE for consideration by the W3C for standardization. These include the 'behaviour' CSS property, which connects the HTML elements with JScript behaviours (known as HTML Components, HTC); [[HTMLplusTIME|HTML+TIME]] profile, which adds timing and media synchronization support to HTML documents (similar to the W3C [[XHTMLplusSMIL|XHTML+SMIL]]), and the [[VML]] [[vector graphics]] file format. However, all were rejected, at least in their original forms; VML was subsequently combined with [[PGML]] (proposed by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]), resulting in the W3C-approved SVG format, one of the few vector image formats being used on the web, which IE did not support until version 9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codedread.com/svg-support.php|title=SVG Support Tables|last=Schiller|first=Jeff|work=codedread.com|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther non-standard behaviours include: support for vertical text, but in a syntax different from W3C CSS3 candidate recommendation, support for a variety of image effects<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webfx.eae.net/tools/filtertool.html |title=Filter Tool (WebFX) |author= |date=May 12, 2005 |publisher=webfx.eae.net |accessdate=}}</ref> and page transitions, which are not found in W3C CSS, support for [[obfuscated code|obfuscated]] script code, in particular [[JScript.Encode]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions//cbfz3598(v=vs.85)|title=Using Script Encoder|date=October 24, 2011|work=Microsoft Docs|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> as well as support for [[font embedding|embedding]] [[Embedded OpenType|EOT]] fonts in [[Font embedding on the Web|web pages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/default.aspx|title=Font Embedding for the Web|date=February 26, 2001|work=Microsoft Typography|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428064515/http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/default.aspx|archive-date=April 28, 2005|url-status=|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Favicon===\nSupport for [[favicon]]s was first added in Internet Explorer 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537656(VS.85).aspx|title=How to Add a Shortcut Icon to a Web Page|work=[[MSDN]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217122653/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537656(VS.85).aspx|archive-date=December 17, 2008|url-status=|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> Internet Explorer supports favicons in [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], static [[GIF]] and [[ICO (file format)|native Windows icon]] formats.

Tabbed browsing can also be added to older versions by installing [[MSN Search Toolbar]] or [[Yahoo Toolbar]].\n\n===Cache===\n{{Main|Temporary Internet Files|Index.dat}}\n\nInternet Explorer caches visited content in the [[Temporary Internet Files]] folder to allow quicker access (or offline access) to previously visited pages. The content is indexed in a database file, known as [[Index.dat]]. Multiple Index.dat files exist which index different content\u2014visited content, [[web feed]]s, visited [[URL]]s, cookies, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/archive/2006/08/04/WinInet_Index_dat.aspx|title=A bit about WinInet's Index.dat|author=Windows Core Networking Team|date=August 4, 2006|website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112205144/http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/archive/2006/08/04/WinInet_Index_dat.aspx|archive-date=January 12, 2008|url-status=|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPrior to IE7, clearing the cache used to clear the index but the files themselves were not reliably removed, posing a potential security and privacy risk.

Administrators of [[Windows Server domain]]s (for domain-joined computers) or the local computer can apply and enforce a variety of settings on computers that affect the user interface (such as disabling menu items and individual configuration options), as well as underlying security features such as downloading of files, zone configuration, per-site settings, ActiveX control behaviour and others.  Policy settings can be configured for each user and for each machine. Internet Explorer also supports [[Integrated Windows Authentication]].\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:IExplore.svg|thumb|right|The architecture of IE8. Previous versions had a similar architecture, except that both tabs and the UI were within the same process. Consequently, each browser window could have only one \"tab process\".]]\nInternet Explorer uses a [[software componentry|componentized]] architecture built on the [[Component Object Model]] (COM) technology.

Rather, {{samp|MSHTML.dll}} exposes an API that permits a programmer to develop a scripting environment to be plugged-in and to access the DOM tree. Internet Explorer 8 includes the bindings for the [[Active Scripting]] engine, which is a part of [[Microsoft Windows]] and allows any language implemented as an Active Scripting module to be used for client-side scripting. By default, only the JScript and [[VBScript]] modules are provided; third party implementations like [[ScreamingMonkey]] (for ECMAScript 4 support) can also be used. Microsoft also makes available the [[Microsoft Silverlight]] runtime (not supported in [[Windows RT]]) that allows [[CLI languages]], including [[Dynamic Language Runtime|DLR]]-based dynamic languages like [[IronPython]] and [[IronRuby]], to be used for client-side scripting.\n\nInternet Explorer 8 introduces some major architectural changes, called ''Loosely Coupled IE'' (LCIE). LCIE separates the main window process (frame process) from the processes hosting the different web applications in different tabs (tab processes). A frame process can create multiple tab processes, each of which can be of a different [[Mandatory Integrity Control|integrity level]]; each tab process can host multiple web sites. The processes use asynchronous [[Inter-Process Communication]] to synchronize themselves. Generally, there will be a single frame process for all web sites. In [[Windows Vista]] with Protected Mode turned on, however, opening privileged content (such as local HTML pages) will create a new tab process as it will not be constrained by Protected Mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2008/03/11/ie8-and-loosely-coupled-ie-lcie/|title=IE8 and Loosely Coupled IE|last=Zeigler|first=Andy|date=March 11, 2008|website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Extensibility==\nInternet Explorer exposes a set of Component Object Model (COM) interfaces that allows [[Plug-in (computing)|add-ons]] to extend the functionality of the browser.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> Extensibility is divided into two types: Browser extensibility and content extensibility. Browser extensibility involves adding context menu entries, toolbars, menu items or [[Browser Helper Objects]] (BHO). BHOs are used to extend the feature set of the browser, whereas the other extensibility options are used to expose that feature in the user interface. Content extensibility adds support for non-native content formats.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> It allows Internet Explorer to handle new [[file format]]s and new [[network protocol|protocols]], e.g. [[WebM]] or SPDY.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> In addition, web pages can integrate [[software widget|widgets]] known as ActiveX controls which run on Windows only but have vast potentials to extend the content capabilities; [[Adobe Flash Player]] and Microsoft Silverlight are examples.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> Add-ons can be installed either locally, or directly by a web site.\n\nSince malicious add-ons can compromise the security of a system, Internet Explorer implements several safeguards. Internet Explorer 6 with Service Pack 2 and later feature an Add-on Manager for enabling or disabling individual add-ons, complemented by a \"No Add-Ons\" mode. [[Security and safety features new to Windows Vista#Application isolation|Starting with Windows Vista]], Internet Explorer and its BHOs run with restricted privileges and are isolated from the rest of the system. Internet Explorer 9 introduced a new component&nbsp;\u2013 Add-on Performance Advisor. Add-on Performance Advisor shows a notification when one or more of installed add-ons exceed a pre-set performance threshold. The notification appears in the Notification Bar when the user launches the browser. Windows 8 and Windows RT introduce a [[Metro-style app|Metro-style version]] of Internet Explorer that is entirely sandboxed and does not run add-ons at all.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/australian-technology/a-look-at-internet-explorer-10-on-windows-rt/|title = A look at Internet Explorer 10 on Windows RT|date = January 20, 2013|accessdate = |website = [[TechRepublic]]|publisher = [[CBS Interactive]]|last = McSherry|first = Tony}}</ref> In addition, Windows RT cannot download or install ActiveX controls at all; although existing ones bundled with Windows RT still run in the traditional version of Internet Explorer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nInternet Explorer itself can be hosted by other applications via a set of COM interfaces. This can be used to embed the browser functionality inside a computer program or create [[Internet Explorer shell]]s.<ref name=\"architecture\" />\n\n==Security==\n{{See also|Browser security}}\nInternet Explorer uses a zone-based [[computer security|security]] framework that groups sites based on certain conditions, including whether it is an Internet- or intranet-based site as well as a user-editable whitelist. Security restrictions are applied per zone; all the sites in a zone are subject to the restrictions.\n\nInternet Explorer 6 SP2 onwards uses the ''Attachment Execution Service'' of Microsoft Windows to mark executable files downloaded from the Internet as being potentially unsafe. Accessing files marked as such will prompt the user to make an explicit trust decision to execute the file, as executables originating from the Internet can be potentially unsafe. This helps in preventing accidental installation of malware.\n\nInternet Explorer 7 introduced the phishing filter, that restricts access to [[phishing]] sites unless the user overrides the decision. With version 8, it also blocks access to sites known to host [[malware]]. Downloads are also checked to see if they are known to be malware-infected.\n\nIn Windows Vista, Internet Explorer by default runs in what is called ''Protected Mode'', where the privileges of the browser itself are severely restricted\u2014it cannot make any system-wide changes. One can optionally turn this mode off but this is not recommended. This also effectively restricts the privileges of any add-ons. As a result, even if the browser or any add-on is compromised, the damage the security breach can cause is limited.\n\nPatches and updates to the browser are released periodically and made available through the Windows Update service, as well as through Automatic Updates. Although security patches continue to be released for a range of platforms, most feature additions and security infrastructure improvements are only made available on operating systems which are in Microsoft's mainstream support phase.\n\nOn December 16, 2008, [[Trend Micro]] recommended users switch to rival browsers until an emergency patch was released to fix a potential security risk which \"could allow outside users to take control of a person's computer and steal their passwords\". Microsoft representatives countered this recommendation, claiming that \"0.02% of internet sites\" were affected by the flaw. A fix for the issue was released the following day with the Security Update for Internet Explorer KB960714, on Microsoft Windows Update.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/world/north-america/security-risk-detected-in-internet-explorer-software-14110209.html |title=Security risk detected in Internet Explorer software |date=December 16, 2008 |newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7784908.stm |newspaper=BBC News | title=Serious security flaw found in IE | date=December 16, 2008 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Germany's Federal Office for Information Security, known by its German initials, BSI, advised \"temporary use of alternative browsers\" because of a \"critical security hole\" in Microsoft's software that could allow hackers to remotely plant and run malicious code on Windows PCs. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Business Technology: Microsoft's Internet Explorer Is Under Fire in Europe|last=Wingfield|first=Nick|date=January 19, 2010|work=The Wall Street Journal|last2=McGroarty|first2=Patrick}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, a report by Accuvant, funded by Google, rated the security (based on sandboxing) of Internet Explorer worse than [[Google Chrome]] but better than [[Mozilla Firefox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/12/09/chrome_ie_firefox_security_bakeoff|title=Chrome is the most secured browser \u2013 new study|website=The Register|first=Dan|last=Goodin|date=December 9, 2011|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Accuvant Study Finds Chrome is Most Secure Browser|url=http://www.esecurityplanet.com/browser-security/accuvant-study-finds-chrome-is-most-secure-browser.html|date=December 13, 2011|publisher=eSecurity Planet|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nA 2017 browser security white paper comparing Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and [[Internet Explorer 11]] by X41 D-Sec in 2017 came to similar conclusions, also based on sandboxing and support of legacy web technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://browser-security.x41-dsec.de/X41-Browser-Security-White-Paper.pdf|title=Browser Security White Paper|publisher=X41-Dsec GmbH|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Security vulnerabilities===\n{{See also|Comparison of web browsers#Security and vulnerabilities}}\nInternet Explorer has been subjected to many security vulnerabilities and concerns:<!-- Now, in one sentence, we answer how the security issues, enumerated and detailed ELSEWHERE, affect people such that the volume of criticism for IE is unusually high --> much of the [[spyware]], [[adware]], and [[computer virus]]es across the Internet are made possible by exploitable bugs and flaws in the security architecture of Internet Explorer, sometimes requiring nothing more than viewing of a malicious web page in order to install themselves. This is known as a \"[[drive-by download|drive-by install]]\". There are also attempts to trick the user into installing malicious software by misrepresenting the software's true purpose in the description section of an ActiveX security alert.\n\nA number of security flaws affecting IE originated not in the browser itself, but ActiveX-based add-ons used by it. Because the add-ons have the same privilege as IE, the flaws can be as critical as browser flaws. This has led to the ActiveX-based architecture being criticized for being fault-prone. By 2005, some experts maintained that the dangers of ActiveX have been overstated and there were safeguards in place.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/The-Lame-Blame-of-ActiveX/\n|title=The Lame Blame of ActiveX\n|date=April 14, 2005\n|accessdate=April 7, 2006\n|work = Security\u2014Opinions\n|publisher=eWeek\n|last=Seltzer\n|first=Larry\n}}</ref> In 2006, new techniques using [[automated testing]] found more than a hundred vulnerabilities in standard Microsoft ActiveX components.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11403\n|title=ActiveX security faces storm before calm\n|date=July 31, 2006\n|accessdate=July 11, 2009\n|publisher=Security Focus\n|last=Lemos\n|first=Robert\n}}</ref> Security features introduced in Internet Explorer 7 mitigated some of these vulnerabilities.\n\nIn 2008, Internet Explorer had a number of published security vulnerabilities.

browsers]] according to [[StatCounter]] ]]\n[[File:Internet-explorer-usage-data.svg|thumb|left|300px|Historical market share of Internet Explorer]]\n\nThe adoption rate of Internet Explorer seems to be closely related to that of Microsoft Windows, as it is the default web browser that comes with Windows. Since the integration of Internet Explorer 2.0 with Windows 95 OSR 1 in 1996, and especially after version 4.0's release in 1997, the adoption was greatly accelerated: from below 20% in 1996, to about 40% in 1998, and over 80% in 2000. This made Microsoft the winner in the infamous '[[first browser war]]' against Netscape. [[Netscape Navigator]] was the dominant browser during 1995 and until 1997, but rapidly lost share to IE starting in 1998, and eventually slipped behind in 1999. The integration of IE with Windows led to a lawsuit by [[AOL]], Netscape's owner, accusing Microsoft of unfair competition. The infamous case was eventually won by AOL but by then it was too late, as Internet Explorer had already become the dominant browser.\n\nInternet Explorer peaked during 2002 and 2003, with about 95% share. Its first notable competitor after beating Netscape was Firefox from [[Mozilla]], which itself was an offshoot from Netscape.\n\nFirefox 1.0 had surpassed Internet Explorer 5 in early 2005, with Firefox 1.0 at roughly 8 percent market share.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2&qpmr=40&qpdt=1&qpct=3&qptimeframe=M&qpsp=74 |title=Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines |author= |date= |publisher=marketshare.hitslink.com |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nApproximate usage over time based on various usage share counters averaged for the year overall, or for the fourth quarter, or for the last month in the year depending on availability of reference.<ref name=\"nashare\">{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/ |title=Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines |publisher=marketshare.hitslink.com |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}</ref><ref name=zdnetearly>Borland, John.

Because of the use of COM, it is possible to embed web-browsing functionality in third-party applications. Hence, there are a number of Internet Explorer shells, and a number of content-centric applications like [[RealPlayer]] also use Internet Explorer's web browsing module for viewing web pages within the applications.\n\n==Removal==\n{{Main|Removal of Internet Explorer}}\nWhile a major upgrade of Internet Explorer can be uninstalled in a traditional way if the user has saved the original application files for installation, the matter of uninstalling the version of the browser that has shipped with an operating system remains a controversial one.\n\nThe idea of removing a stock install of Internet Explorer from a Windows system was proposed during the ''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)|United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'' case. One of Microsoft's arguments during the trial was that removing Internet Explorer from Windows may result in system instability. Indeed, programs that depend on libraries installed by IE, including Windows help and support system, fail to function without IE. Before Windows Vista, it was not possible to run [[Windows Update]] without IE because the service used ActiveX technology, which no other web browser supports.\n\n==Impersonation by malware==\nThe popularity of Internet Explorer has led to the appearance of malware abusing its name. On January 28, 2011, a fake Internet Explorer browser calling itself \"Internet Explorer \u2013 Emergency Mode\" appeared. It closely resembles the real Internet Explorer, but has fewer buttons and no search bar.
