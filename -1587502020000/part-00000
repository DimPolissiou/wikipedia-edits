The analysis, often called an '''ESA''', typically addresses both the underlying land as well as physical improvements to the property. A proportion of contaminated sites are \"[[brownfield site]]s.\"  In severe cases, brownfield sites may be added to the [[National Priorities List]] where they will be subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's [[Superfund]] program. \n \nThe actual sampling of soil, air, groundwater and/or building materials is typically not conducted during a Phase I ESA.   The Phase I ESA is generally considered the first step in the process of environmental [[due diligence]].

Many times these studies were preparatory to understanding the nature of cleanup costs if the property was being considered for [[redevelopment]] or change of [[land use]].\n\nIn the [[United States of America]] demand increased dramatically for this type of study in the 1980s following judicial decisions related to liability of property owners to effect site cleanup.  Interpreting the [[Superfund|Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980]] (CERCLA), the U.S. courts have held that a buyer, lessor, or lender may be held responsible for [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of hazardous substance residues, even if a prior owner caused the contamination; performance of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, according to the courts' reasoning, creates a [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]], known as the 'Innocent Landowner Defense'.\n\nIn 1998 the necessity of performing a Phase I ESA was underscored by congressional action in passing the [[Superfund Cleanup Acceleration Act of 1998]].<ref>''Superfund Cleanup Acceleration Act of 1998'', U.S. Congress, March 26, 1998</ref>  This act requires purchasers of commercial property to perform a Phase I study meeting the specific standard of [[ASTM]] E1527: Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process.\n\nThe most recent standard is \"Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries\" 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 312<ref name = \"Final Rule\" /> which drew heavily from ASTM E1527-13, which is the ASTM Standard for conducting 'All Appropriate Inquiry' (AAI) for the environmental assessment of a real property.  Previous guidances regarding the ASTM E1527 standard were ASTM E1527-97, ASTM E1527-00, and ASTM E1527-05.\n\nResidential property purchasers need only conduct a site inspection and chain of title survey.\n\n==Triggering actions==\nA variety of reasons for a Phase I study to be performed exist, the most common being:<ref>Thomas M Missimer and Missimer M Missimer, ''A Lender's Guide to Environmental Liability Management'' [[CRC Press]] (1996)</ref>\n\n* Purchase of [[real property]] by a person or entity not previously on [[title (property)|title]].\n* Contemplation by a new lender to provide a loan on the subject [[real estate]].\n* Partnership buyout or principal redistribution of ownership.\n* Application to a [[government agency|public agency]] for change of use or other discretionary land use permit.\n* Existing property owner's desire to understand toxic history of the property.\n* Compulsion by a regulatory agency who suspects toxic conditions on the site.\n* Divestiture of properties\n\n==Scope==\nScrutiny of the land includes examination of potential [[soil contamination]], [[groundwater]] quality, [[surface water]] quality and sometimes issues related to hazardous substance uptake by [[biota (ecology)|biota]].  The examination of a site may include: definition of any chemical residues within structures; identification of possible [[asbestos]] containing [[building material]]s; inventory of [[hazardous]] substances stored or used on site; assessment of [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] and [[mildew]]; and evaluation of other [[indoor air quality]] parameters.<ref>[[Sara N Martin]], ''[[Site Assessment and Remediation Handbook]]'', [[CRC Press]] (2003)</ref>\n\n[[File:Asbestos fibres.jpg|thumb|200px|Asbestos-containing materials are not typically surveyed or sampled in a Phase I site inspection, but suspect building materials may be noted]]\n\nDepending upon precise protocols utilized, there are a number of variations in the scope of a Phase I study.

At least one jurisdiction in Canada ([[Ontario]]) now requires the completion of a Phase I prior to the transfer of some types of industrial properties.  Some parts of Europe began to conduct Phase I studies on selected properties in the 1990s, but still lack the comprehensive attention given to virtually all major real estate transactions in the USA.\n\nIn the United Kingdom contaminated land regulation is outlined in the [[Environment Act 1995]]. The [[Environment Agency]] of England and Wales have produced a set of guidance; CLEA a standardized approach to the assessment of land contamination. A Phase 1 Desktop Study is often required in support of a planning application.<ref>[http://southwest-environmental.co.uk/Deskto%20Study_copy(1).html Desktop Study Reports (Phase 1)]</ref> In the UK these reports must be assembled by a \"competent person\".\n\n==Other environmental site assessment types==\n[[File:Hazardous-pesticide.jpg|thumb|left|Storage and handling of toxics is assessed for each site within a Phase I study.]]\n\nThere are several other report types that have some resemblance in name or degree of detail to the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment:\n\n'''Phase II Environmental Site Assessment''' is an \"intrusive\" investigation which collects original samples of soil, groundwater or building materials to analyze for quantitative values of various contaminants.<ref>''[[Environmental Aspects of Real Estate and Commercial Transactions: From Brownfields to Green Buildings]]'', [[American Bar Association]], ed. by James B. Witkin (2002)</ref>  This investigation is normally undertaken when a Phase I ESA determines a likelihood of site contamination.  The most frequent substances tested are [[petroleum]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[heavy metals]], [[pesticide]]s, [[solvent]]s, asbestos and mold.\n\n'''Phase III Environmental Site Assessment''' is an investigation involving remediation of a site. Phase III investigations aim to delineate the physical extent of contamination based on recommendations made in Phase II assessments. Phase III investigations may involve intensive testing, sampling, and monitoring, \"fate and transport\" studies and other modeling, and the design of feasibility studies for remediation and remedial plans. This study normally involves assessment of alternative cleanup methods, costs and logistics. The associated reportage details the steps taken to perform site cleanup and the follow-up monitoring for residual contaminants.\n\n'''Limited Phase I Environmental Site Assessment''' is a truncated Phase I ESA, normally omitting one or more work segments such as the site visit or certain of the file searches. When the field visit component is deleted the study is sometimes called a '''Transaction Screen'''.\n\n'''Environmental Assessment''' has little to do with the subject of hazardous substance liability, but rather is a study preliminary to an [[Environmental Impact Statement]], which identifies environmental impacts of a land development action and analyzes a broad set of parameters including [[biodiversity]], [[environmental noise]], [[water pollution]], [[air pollution]], [[traffic]], [[geotechnical]] risks, visual impacts, public safety issues and also hazardous substance issues.\n\n'''SBA Phase I Environmental Site Assessment''' means {{visible anchor|all}} properties purchased through the United States [[Small Business Administration]]'s 504 Fixed Asset Financing Program require specific and often higher [[due diligence]] requirements than regular [[Real Estate]] transactions. Due diligence requirements are determined according to the [[NAICS]] codes associated with the prior business use of the property.  There are 58 specific NAICS codes that require Phase I Investigations.  These include, but are not limited to: Funeral Homes, Dry Cleaners, and [[Gas Station]]s. The SBA also requires Phase II Environmental Site Assessment to be performed on any Gas Station that has been in operation for more than 5 years. The additional cost to perform this assessment cannot be included in the amount requested in the loan and adds significant costs to the borrower.\n\n'''Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae Phase I Environmental Site Assessments'''[https://www.partneresi.com/resources/publications/going-through-a-phase-fannie-mae-freddie-mac-environmental-guidelines] are two specialized types of Phase I ESAs that are required when a loan is financed through Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae.  The scopes of work are based on the ASTM E1527-05 Standard but have specific requirements including the following: the percent and scope of the property inspection; requirements for radon testing; asbestos and lead-based paint testing and operations-and-maintenance (O&M) plans to manage the hazards in place; lead in drinking water; and mold inspection.

Among the [[List of the oldest schools in the United Kingdom|oldest schools in the United Kingdom]], it has a traceable history to 1096 as an episcopal [[grammar school]] established by [[Herbert de Losinga]], first [[Bishop of Norwich]]. In the 16th century the school came under the control of the city of Norwich and moved to [[St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich|Blackfriars' Hall]] following a successful petition to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The school was refounded in 1547 in a [[royal charter]] granted by [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and moved to its current site beside the cathedral in 1551. In the 19th century it became independent of the city and its [[Classics|classical]] curriculum was broadened in response to the declining demand for classical education following the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nEarly statutes declared the school was to instruct 90 sons of Norwich citizens, though it has since grown to a total enrolment of approximately 1,020 pupils. For most of its history it was a boys' school, before becoming co-educational in the [[sixth form]] in 1994 and in every year group in 2010. The school is divided into the Senior School, which has around 850 pupils aged from 11 to 18 across eight [[House system|houses]], and the [[Lower School, Norwich|Lower School]], which was established in 1946 and has around 250 pupils aged from 4 to 11. The school educates the choristers of the cathedral, with which the school has a close relationship and which is used for morning assemblies and events throughout the academic year. In league tables of British schools it is consistently ranked first in Norfolk and Suffolk and amongst the highest in the United Kingdom.\n\nFormer pupils are referred to as [[List of Old Norvicensians|Old Norvicensians]] or ONs. The school has maintained a strong academic tradition and has educated a number of notable figures including [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]] and 17 [[Fellows of the Royal Society]] among many others. Several members of the [[Norwich School (art movement)|Norwich School]] of painters, the first provincial [[art movement]] in England, were educated at the school and the movement's founder, [[John Crome]], also taught at the school.<ref name=Cundall1920p1>{{harvnb|Cundall|1920|p=1}}.</ref> It is a founding member of the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]] (HMC), a member of the [[List of choir schools|Choir Schools' Association]] and has a historical connection with the [[Worshipful Company of Dyers]], one of the [[Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]].\n\n==History==\n===Establishment and early history===\n[[Image:Herbert de Losinga, Bauchon Window, Norwich Cathedral.jpg|thumb|150px|right|alt=Stained glass window depicting Herbert de Losinga|Stained-glass depiction of Herbert de Losinga in Norwich Cathedral]]\n\nNorwich School traces its origins to the founding of an episcopal [[grammar school]] in 1096 by [[Herbert de Losinga]], first [[Bishop of Norwich]].

Among the [[List of the oldest schools in the United Kingdom|oldest schools in the United Kingdom]], it has a traceable history to 1096 as an episcopal [[grammar school]] established by [[Herbert de Losinga]], first [[Bishop of Norwich]]. In the 16th century the school came under the control of the city of Norwich and moved to [[St. Andrew's Hall, Norwich|Blackfriars' Hall]] following a successful petition to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The school was refounded in 1547 in a [[royal charter]] granted by [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and moved to its current site beside the cathedral in 1551. In the 19th century it became independent of the city and its [[Classics|classical]] curriculum was broadened in response to the declining demand for classical education following the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nEarly statutes declared the school was to instruct 90 sons of Norwich citizens, though it has since grown to a total enrolment of approximately 1,020 pupils. For most of its history it was a boys' school, before becoming co-educational in the [[sixth form]] in 1994 and in every year group in 2010. The school is divided into the Senior School, which has around 850 pupils aged from 12 to 18 across eight [[House system|houses]], and the [[Lower School, Norwich|Lower School]], which was established in 1946 and has around 250 pupils aged from 4 to 11. The school educates the choristers of the cathedral, with which the school has a close relationship and which is used for morning assemblies and events throughout the academic year. In league tables of British schools it is consistently ranked first in Norfolk and Suffolk and amongst the highest in the United Kingdom.\n\nFormer pupils are referred to as [[List of Old Norvicensians|Old Norvicensians]] or ONs. The school has maintained a strong academic tradition and has educated a number of notable figures including [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]] and 17 [[Fellows of the Royal Society]] among many others. Several members of the [[Norwich School (art movement)|Norwich School]] of painters, the first provincial [[art movement]] in England, were educated at the school and the movement's founder, [[John Crome]], also taught at the school.<ref name=Cundall1920p1>{{harvnb|Cundall|1920|p=1}}.</ref> It is a founding member of the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]] (HMC), a member of the [[List of choir schools|Choir Schools' Association]] and has a historical connection with the [[Worshipful Company of Dyers]], one of the [[Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]].\n\n==History==\n===Establishment and early history===\n[[Image:Herbert de Losinga, Bauchon Window, Norwich Cathedral.jpg|thumb|150px|right|alt=Stained glass window depicting Herbert de Losinga|Stained-glass depiction of Herbert de Losinga in Norwich Cathedral]]\n\nNorwich School traces its origins to the founding of an episcopal [[grammar school]] in 1096 by [[Herbert de Losinga]], first [[Bishop of Norwich]].

In some cases (secondarily), the horse may present with acute severe dyspnea, such that it really struggles to inspire sufficient air. This is a veterinary emergency.\n\nIn addition, a soft, moist cough may be seen, most commonly in association with exercise or eating. This cough may be productive, with expectoration of thick, viscous sputum.\n\nThere may also be an audible [[wheeze]].\n\nIn [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] cases, a \"heave line\" may be visible on the [[ventral]] abdomen. This is caused by [[hypertrophy]] of the extrinsic respiratory muscles.\n\nIf any of these symptoms are observed, veterinary advice should be sought. The veterinarian will usually [[auscultate]] (listen to the horse's chest with a stethoscope) to attempt to detect adventitious lung sounds. If these are very quiet, a rebreathing bag may be used - a plastic bag over the nose to intensify the horse's respiratory effort and hence the sounds. '''This procedure can be dangerous and should not be attempted by non-professionals.'''\n\n[[Blood gas analysis]] may also be carried out, although it is rarely required.\n\nIn some cases, a [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] may be carried out - an [[endoscope]] is used to look down the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], and mucus and cells are washed out of the lower airways for analysis. Typically, a BAL recovers an abnormally high percentage of [[neutrophils]] from an RAO horse - up to 50 or 70% in severe cases.<ref>RJ Rose & DR Hodgson, ''Manual of Equine Practice'' Copyright WB Saunders (2000)</ref><ref>H. Sasse (2001), \"Clinician's perspective of equine airway disease(Heaves)\", in \"\"International Workshop on Equine Chronic Airway Disease\", ''Equine Veterinary Journal'' 33(1) 5-19</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nAn [[allergic]] reaction to certain otherwise innocuous substances - [[allergen]]s, typically dust and [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] [[spore]]s (e.g. [[Aspergillus]] spp.). It is therefore most common in horses fed on hay and bedded on straw.<ref>Jackson, C.A.; Berney, C.; Jefcoat, A.M.; Robinson, N.E.

This can be a life-saving measure in an [[acute (medical)|acute]] attack.\n\nAs RAO is primarily a management condition, primary treatment is managemental.

The aim is to minimise dust and maximise air quality in the stable. This may be achieved by soaking hay or feeding a dust-free alternative (such as [[haylage]]). The length of time to soak hay for the maximum benefit is debated; however, approximately 30 minutes appears to be the current consensus.<ref>J M Clements, R S Pirie (2007) \"Respirable dust concentrations in equine stables.

One of the most common is [[clenbuterol]], either as an oral medication administered twice daily in feed, or via the [[intravenous]] route. \nAlternatively, [[aerosol]]ised drugs, such as [[salbutamol]] or clenbuterol, may be used.

Bertone, LJ. I. Horspool, ''Equine Clinical Pharmacology'' Published 2004, Elsevier Health Sciences</ref>\n\n2)  [[Corticosteroids]]:\nOral steroids such as [[prednisolone]] are commonly used; however, side effects are common, and the horse may be predisposed to [[laminitis]]. Therefore, the use of [[aerosol]]ised steroids via an equine inhaler are becoming more common. This route of administration reduces the dose required, and the risk of side effects. Originally, [[beclomethasone]] was used, but newer compounds are available now, such as [[fluticasone propionate]].<ref>Tamarinde TJM Laan (2001), \"Serum Cortisol Concentrations in Response to Fluticasone Propionate Inhalation Therapy in Horses\" ''The 20th Symposium of the Veterinary Comparative Respiratory Society'' [http://www.the-vcrs.org/2001-Edinburgh-Abstracts-1.pdf]</ref>\n\n3)  [[Mast cell]] stabilisers:\nCromoglycate has been used, but this is may or may not be fully effective, as in RAO mast cells have only a peripheral role in the [[pathophysiology]].<ref>Melissa R.

Hoffman (2003), \"Clinical techniques for diagnosis of inflammatory airway disease in the horse\", ''Clinical Techniques in Equine Practice'' Vol 2 Issue 3, 238-257</ref>\n\nCare should be taken with these drugs in competition horses, as many of them are forbidden substances under racing and [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] rules.\n\n4)  Hay Steamers:  A relatively new method of dealing with RAO with horses is to thoroughly Steam the Hay in a commercially available steamer.  Feedback from users is very encouraging on the relief factor obtained from RAO.  Consistency in feeding horses is important and the hay is just another feed component.  A great number of horses suffer from respiratory conditions that is a direct result of the hay they are feeding on. Stored hay contains dust and fungal spores that can cause irritation and inflammation, that can lead to COPD, airway and digestive conditions.\n\n5) Liver Function Monitoring: because mold may potentially cause liver damage, it is advisable to evaluate parameters related to liver health and, if possible, to adopt hepatoprotective foods or medicines, as well as other measures favorable to the reestablishment of liver functions\n\n==Prognosis==\nRAO often limits the horse's ability to work, and it may find strenuous activity difficult. However, with prompt diagnosis and treatment the condition can be managed successfully.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Horse diseases]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the disease that affects horses|the similar disease in humans|Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}}\n{{Redirect|Broken wind|Breaking wind|Flatulence}}\n{{Redirect|Heaves|the palpable precordial impulse|Parasternal heave|other uses|Heave (disambiguation){{!}}Heave}}\n'''Recurrent airway obstruction''', also known as '''broken wind''', '''heaves''', '''wind-broke horse''', or sometimes by the term usually reserved for humans, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] or disorder ('''COPD''') \u2013 it is a [[respiratory disease]] or [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] condition of horses involving an [[allergic]] [[bronchitis]] characterised by wheezing, coughing and laboured breathing.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSymptoms include, primarily, increased respiratory effort and [[dyspnea]], especially in response to strenuous exercise. In some cases (secondarily), the horse may present with acute severe dyspnea, such that it really struggles to inspire sufficient air. This is a veterinary emergency.\n\nIn addition, a soft, moist cough may be seen, most commonly in association with exercise or eating. This cough may be productive, with expectoration of thick, viscous sputum.\n\nThere may also be an audible [[wheeze]].\n\nIn [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] cases, a \"heave line\" may be visible on the [[ventral]] abdomen. This is caused by [[hypertrophy]] of the extrinsic respiratory muscles.\n\nIf any of these symptoms are observed, veterinary advice should be sought. The veterinarian will usually [[auscultate]] (listen to the horse's chest with a stethoscope) to attempt to detect adventitious lung sounds. If these are very quiet, a rebreathing bag may be used - a plastic bag over the nose to intensify the horse's respiratory effort and hence the sounds. '''This procedure can be dangerous and should not be attempted by non-professionals.'''\n\n[[Blood gas analysis]] may also be carried out, although it is rarely required.\n\nIn some cases, a [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] may be carried out - an [[endoscope]] is used to look down the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], and mucus and cells are washed out of the lower airways for analysis. Typically, a BAL recovers an abnormally high percentage of [[neutrophils]] from an RAO horse - up to 50 or 70% in severe cases.<ref>RJ Rose & DR Hodgson, ''Manual of Equine Practice'' Copyright WB Saunders (2000)</ref><ref>H.

The company is best known for the ''[[Black & White (series)|Black & White]]'' and ''[[Fable (video game series)|Fable]]'' series. Lionhead started as a breakaway from developer [[Bullfrog Productions]], which was also founded by Molyneux. Lionhead's first game was ''[[Black & White (video game)|Black & White]]'', a [[god game]] with elements of [[artificial life]] and [[Strategy game|strategy]] games. ''Black & White'' was published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 2001. Lionhead Studios is named after Webley's [[hamster]], which died not long after the naming of the studio, as a result of which the studio was very briefly renamed to Redeye Studios.\n\n''Black & White'' was followed up with the release of an expansion pack named ''[[Black & White: Creature Isle]]''. Lionhead released ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable]]'', from satellite developer [[Big Blue Box]]. In 2005, Lionhead released ''[[The Movies]]'' and ''[[Black & White 2]]''. Lionhead was acquired by [[Microsoft Studios]] in April 2006 due to encountering financial difficulties. Many Lionhead developers left around this time, including co-founder Jackson and several developers who left to found [[Media Molecule]]. Molyneux left Lionhead in early 2012 (shortly after the resignation of another group of developers who were dissatisfied with the company) to found [[22Cans]] because he wanted to be more creative. After Molyneux's departure, Microsoft had Lionhead switch to developing [[games as a service]] games. As a result, there were many changes within the studio.\n\nIn March 2016, [[Microsoft]] announced that it had proposed closing Lionhead Studios and that the planned game ''[[Fable Legends]]'' would be cancelled.<ref name=\"McWhertor\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/3/7/11172408/fable-legends-canceled-lionhead-studios-closing|title=Microsoft cancels Fable Legends, plans to shut down Lionhead Studios|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=7 March 2016|website=Polygon|language=en-US|access-date=7 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307165545/http://www.polygon.com/2016/3/7/11172408/fable-legends-canceled-lionhead-studios-closing|archive-date=7 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/fable-legends-is-cancelled-lionhead-studios-to-close/|title=Fable Legends is cancelled, Lionhead Studios to close|website=PC Gamer|access-date=7 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307172316/http://www.pcgamer.com/fable-legends-is-cancelled-lionhead-studios-to-close/|archive-date=7 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> On 29 April 2016, Lionhead Studios closed down.<ref name=\"eurogamer.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-29-fable-developer-lionhead-closes-down-today|title=Fable developer Lionhead closes down today|date=29 April 2016|work=Eurogamer.net|access-date=29 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429125502/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-29-fable-developer-lionhead-closes-down-today|archive-date=29 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A few months after Lionhead's closure, two key people (Webley and [[Gary Carr (video game developer)|Gary Carr]], who was Lionhead's creative director), founded [[Two Point Studios]].\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\n[[File:Peter-molyneux-at-university-of-southampton.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Peter Molyneux (2007), co-founder of Lionhead Studios]]\n[[Peter Molyneux]] founded [[Bullfrog Productions]] in 1987, which was later acquired by [[Electronic Arts]] (EA) in 1995.

featured a dog who was able to dig them up) to a modern one, despite the game being set in an earlier era. Lionhead and Microsoft conflicted over the game's marketing: Microsoft believed that role-playing games were about dragons and wanted to market the game as such, despite Lionhead's insistence that the game was \"a Monty Python-esque comedy\". According to ''Fable'' art director John McCormack, the marketing was \"shit\" and that dragons were ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' fare and had nothing to do with ''Fable''.<ref name=\"eg history\"/> Despite the row, most of the ''Fable II'' team thought highly of the relationship between Lionhead and Microsoft, and after the game's release, Lionhead won a [[BAFTA award]] for the best action adventure game. There was also a dispute over ''[[Fable III]]''{{'}}s box art.

[[Steve Jackson (British game designer)|Steve Jackson]]. The company is best known for the ''[[Black & White (series)|Black & White]]'' and ''[[Fable (video game series)|Fable]]'' series. Lionhead started as a breakaway from developer [[Bullfrog Productions]], which was also founded by Molyneux. Lionhead's first game was ''[[Black & White (video game)|Black & White]]'', a [[god game]] with elements of [[artificial life]] and [[Strategy game|strategy]] games. ''Black & White'' was published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 2001. Lionhead Studios is named after Webley's [[hamster]], which died not long after the naming of the studio, as a result of which the studio was very briefly renamed to Redeye Studios.\n\n''Black & White'' was followed up with the release of an expansion pack named ''[[Black & White: Creature Isle]]''. Lionhead released ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable]]'', from satellite developer [[Big Blue Box]]. In 2005, Lionhead released ''[[The Movies]]'' and ''[[Black & White 2]]''. Lionhead was acquired by [[Microsoft Studios]] in April 2006 due to encountering financial difficulties. Many Lionhead developers left around this time, including co-founder Jackson and several developers who left to found [[Media Molecule]]. Molyneux left Lionhead in early 2012 (shortly after the resignation of another group of developers who were dissatisfied with the company) to found [[22Cans]] because he wanted to be more creative. After Molyneux's departure, Microsoft had Lionhead switch to developing [[games as a service]] games. As a result, there were many changes within the studio.\n\nIn March 2016, [[Microsoft]] announced that it had proposed closing Lionhead Studios and that the planned game ''[[Fable Legends]]'' would be cancelled.<ref name=\"McWhertor\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/3/7/11172408/fable-legends-canceled-lionhead-studios-closing|title=Microsoft cancels Fable Legends, plans to shut down Lionhead Studios|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=7 March 2016|website=Polygon|language=en-US|access-date=7 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307165545/http://www.polygon.com/2016/3/7/11172408/fable-legends-canceled-lionhead-studios-closing|archive-date=7 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/fable-legends-is-cancelled-lionhead-studios-to-close/|title=Fable Legends is cancelled, Lionhead Studios to close|website=PC Gamer|access-date=7 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307172316/http://www.pcgamer.com/fable-legends-is-cancelled-lionhead-studios-to-close/|archive-date=7 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> On 29 April 2016, Lionhead Studios closed down.<ref name=\"eurogamer.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-29-fable-developer-lionhead-closes-down-today|title=Fable developer Lionhead closes down today|date=29 April 2016|work=Eurogamer.net|access-date=29 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429125502/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-29-fable-developer-lionhead-closes-down-today|archive-date=29 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A few months after Lionhead's closure, two key people (Webley and [[Gary Carr (video game developer)|Gary Carr]], who was Lionhead's creative director), founded [[Two Point Studios]].\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\n[[File:Peter-molyneux-at-university-of-southampton.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Peter Molyneux (2007), co-founder of Lionhead Studios]]\n[[Peter Molyneux]] founded [[Bullfrog Productions]] in 1987, which was later acquired by [[Electronic Arts]] (EA) in 1995.

general consensus amongst Lionhead was that the buyout \"benefited Lionhead greatly\".<ref name=\"eg history\"/> Microsoft purchased a lease that enabled Lionhead to expand to multiple floors, a canteen, and an office revamp.<ref name=\"eg history\"/> According to ''Fable'' franchise director Ted Timmins, the improvements felt like Lionhead was \"a real developer\".<ref name=\"eg history\"/> The pranks were also reduced.<ref name=\"eg history\"/> During the development of ''Fable II'', Lionhead received death threats because the game featured a gay character and some of the leading characters were black.<ref name=\"eg history\"/> Microsoft, for the most part, left Lionhead alone during the development of ''Fable II'', but did ask them to change the icon of a condom (the game featured a dog who was able to dig them up) to a modern one, despite the game being set in an earlier era. Lionhead and Microsoft conflicted over the game's marketing: Microsoft believed that role-playing games were about dragons and wanted to market the game as such, despite Lionhead's insistence that the game was \"a Monty Python-esque comedy\". According to ''Fable'' art director John McCormack, the marketing was \"shit\" and that dragons were ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' fare and had nothing to do with ''Fable''.<ref name=\"eg history\"/> Despite the row, most of the ''Fable II'' team thought highly of the relationship between Lionhead and Microsoft, and after the game's release, Lionhead won a [[BAFTA award]] for the best action adventure game. There was also a dispute over ''[[Fable III]]''{{'}}s box art. The game was developed and released in 18 months, but fell short of the expectations set by the previous instalment.<ref name=\"eg history\"/> Six months before its release, Lionhead attempted to integrate [[Kinect]] into the game, but failed.

Several Lionhead veterans, dissatisfied with the way the company was heading, resigned on the same day.

Lionhead became more professional and organised according to some staff. One said that Molyneux had the power to keep Microsoft at bay, and his departure left the remaining staff vulnerable.<ref name=\"eg history\"/> Around this time, Microsoft insisted that Lionhead make a [[games as a service]] ''Fable'' game or face closure. Microsoft also said that nobody was to continue making boxed single-player games, and wanted to make more money from the ''Fable'' series. Due to the switch to service games, the idea of ''Fable IV'' was rejected, and experts in monetisation and competitive game design were hired to assist the transition.

There was a small \"live operations\" team that conducted this process, but for others, work was optional.<ref name=\"eg history\"/> An attempt to save the project was made, under the name of ''Project Phoenix''.

However, unlike humans, they also need to digest plant fiber (largely [[cellulose]]) that comes from [[grass]] or [[hay]]. [[Ruminant]]s like cattle are [[foregut fermentation|foregut fermenters]], and digest [[fiber]] in plant matter by use of a multi-chambered [[stomach]], whereas horses use microbial fermentation in a part of the digestive system known as the ''[[cecum]]'' (or ''caecum'') to break down the cellulose.<ref name=\"Rutgers\">[http://www.esc.rutgers.edu/publications/factsheets_nutrition/FS038.htm  Williams, Carey A., Ph.D., Extension Specialist. \"The Basics of Equine Nutrition\"  ''from'' FS #038, Equine Science Center, Rutgers University, Revised: April 2004.] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070408100639/http://esc.rutgers.edu/publications/factsheets_nutrition/FS038.htm |date=2007-04-08 }}  Web site accessed February 9, 2007</ref>\n\nIn practical terms, horses prefer to eat small amounts of food steadily throughout the day, as they do in nature when [[grazing]] on [[pasture]] lands.<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090708022656/http://ohioline.osu.edu/b762/b762_13.html \"Horse Nutrition - Frequency.\" Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University.] Web site accessed February 9, 2007.</ref> Although this is not always possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, it is important to remember the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities.\n\nThe [[digestive system of the horse]] is somewhat delicate.

First, the animal selects pieces of [[forage]] and picks up finer foods, such as [[grain]], with sensitive, [[prehensile]], [[lip]]s.  The front [[horse teeth|teeth]] of the horse, called [[incisor]]s, nip off [[forage]], and food is ground up for swallowing by the [[premolar]]s and [[molars]].<ref name=\"Vet handbook\"/>\n\nThe [[esophagus]] carries food to the stomach. The esophagus enters the stomach at an acute angle, creating a one-way valve, with a powerful [[sphincter]] mechanism at the gastroesophageal junction, which is why horses cannot vomit.<ref name=\"Vet handbook\"/>  The esophagus is also the area of the digestive tract where horses may suffer from [[choke (horse)|choke]]. (''see'' [[#Illnesses related to improper feeding|Illnesses related to improper feeding]] ''below'')\n\n===The stomach and small intestine===\nHorses have a small [[stomach]] for their size, which limits the amount of feed that can be taken in at one time.  The average sized horse has a stomach with a capacity of only {{convert|4|USgal|l}}, and works best when it contains about {{convert|2|USgal|l}}.

Equine nutritionists recommend that 50% or more of the animal's diet by weight should be [[forage]]s.<ref name=\"Feeding factors\"/>  If a horse is working hard and requires more energy, the use of [[grain]] is increased and the percentage of forage decreased so that the horse obtains the energy content it needs for the work it is performing.  However, forage amount should never go below 1% of the horse's body weight per day.<ref name=\"Penn\"/>\n\n===Forages===\n[[File:GrassHay1.jpg|thumb|Good quality grass hay is green and has visible leaves and young seed heads.]]\n[[Forage]]s, also known as \"roughage,\" are plant materials classified as [[legume]]s or [[grass]]es, found in [[pasture]]s or in [[hay]]. Often, pastures and hayfields will contain a blend of both grasses and legumes. Nutrients available in forage vary greatly with maturity of the grasses, fertilization, management, and environmental conditions.<ref name=\"Penn\"/> Grasses are tolerant of a wide range of conditions and contain most necessary nutrients.  Some commonly used grasses include [[Timothy-grass|timothy]], [[bromus|brome]], [[fescue]], [[Cynodon|coastal Bermuda]], [[orchard grass]], and [[Smooth Meadow-grass|Kentucky bluegrass]]. Another type of forage sometimes provided to horses is [[beet pulp]], a byproduct left over from the processing of [[sugar beet]]s, which is high in energy as well as fiber.<ref name=\"Myths\"/>\n\nLegumes such as [[clover]] or [[alfalfa]] are usually higher in [[protein]], [[calcium]], and energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good soil to produce the best nutrients. Legume hays are generally higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.<ref name=\"Carbohydrates\"/>\n\n[[Hay]] is a dried mixture of [[grass]]es and [[legume]]s. It is cut in the field and then dried and baled for storage.<ref name=\"Penn\"/>  Hay is most nutritious when it is cut early on, before the seed heads are fully mature and before the stems of the plants become tough and thick.  Hay that is very green can be a good indicator of the amount of nutrients in the hay; however, color is not the sole indicator of quality&mdash;smell and texture are also important.<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090708015558/http://ohioline.osu.edu/b762/b762_21.html \"Horse Nutrition - Hay quality.\" Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University.] Web site accessed February 9, 2007</ref> Hay can be analyzed by many laboratories and that is the most reliable way to tell the nutritional values it contains.<ref name=\"Purdue\"/>\n\nHay, particularly alfalfa, is sometimes compressed into pellets or cubes.  Processed hay can be of more consistent quality and is more convenient to ship and to store.  It is also easily obtained in areas that may be suffering localized hay shortages.  However, these more concentrated forms can be overfed and horses are somewhat more prone to [[choke (horse)|choke]] on them. On the other hand, hay pellets and cubes can be soaked until they break apart into a pulp or thick slurry, and in this state are a very useful source of food for horses with [[horse teeth|tooth]] problems such as dental disease, tooth loss due to age, or structural anomalies.\n\n''Haylage'', also known as ''Round bale silage'' is a term for grass sealed in airtight plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the [[United Kingdom]] and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States.<ref name=\"Pony2\">[http://www.vetschool.bris.ac.uk/schools/petcare/ponycare/page_06.htm Pony Care:Feeding the pony/horse.  Web site, accessed March 13, 2007]</ref> Because haylage is a type of [[silage]], hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale.<ref name=\"Haylage\"/> If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent [[botulism]] toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.\n\nSometimes, [[straw]] or [[chaff]] is fed to animals. However, this is roughage with little nutritional value other than providing fiber.<ref name=\"Mackay\">[http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/180474/practical-feeding-of-horses.pdf Mackay, Bruce.  \"Practical feeding of horses\" PRIMEFACT 425 September, 2007, New South Wales, Department of Primary Industries.]  Web site accessed July 25, 2008</ref>  It is sometimes used as a filler; it can slow down horses who eat their grain too fast, or it can provide additional fiber when the horse must meet most nutritional needs via concentrated feeds.<ref name=\"Mackay\"/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212744/http://www.hygain.com.au/News/ChafforNoChaff.htm \"Chaff or no Chaff?\"] ''Hygain news,'' web site accessed July 4, 2009.</ref> Straw is more often used as a bedding in stalls to absorb wastes.\n{{See also|forage|hay}}\n\n===Concentrates===\n[[File:Haverkorrels Avena sativa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Oats]]\n[[File:GrainMix.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A premixed ration of crimped corn, oats, barley and pelleted supplement]]\n\n====Grains====\nWhole or crushed [[grain]]s are the most common form of concentrated feed, sometimes referred to generically as \"oats\" or \"corn\" even if those grains are not present, also sometimes called ''straights'' in the [[UK]].\n\n[[Oat]]s are the most popular [[grain]] for horses. Oats have a lower digestible energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains. They form a loose mass in the stomach that is well suited to the equine digestive system. They are also more palatable and digestible than other grains.<ref name=\"Carbohydrates\"/><ref name=\"Horse sense\"/>\n\n[[Barley]] is also fed to horses, but needs to be processed to crack the seed hull and allow easier digestibility.<ref name=\"Carbohydrates\"/> It is frequently fed in combination with oats and corn, a mix informally referred to by the acronym \"COB\" (for Corn, Oats and Barley).\n\n[[Wheat]] is generally not used as a concentrate.  However, [[wheat bran]] is sometimes added to the diet of a horse for supplemental nutrition, usually moistened and in the form of a bran mash.<ref name=\"Carbohydrates\"/>  Wheat bran is high in phosphorus, so must be fed carefully so that it does not cause an imbalance in the Ca:P ratio of a ration <ref>https://thehorse.com/19261/risks-associated-with-feeding-horses-traditional-bran-mashes/</ref>.  Once touted for a laxative effect, this use of bran is now considered unnecessary, as horses, unlike humans, obtain sufficient fiber in their diets from other sources.<ref name=\"Myths\"/>\n\n====Mixes and pellets====\nMany feed manufacturers combine various grains and add additional vitamin and mineral supplements to create a complete premixed feed that is easy for owners to feed and of predictable nutritional quality.<ref name=\"Horse sense\"/>  Some of these prepared feeds are manufactured in pelleted form, others retain the grains in their original form. In many cases [[molasses]] is used as a binder to keep down dust and for increased palatability.<ref name=\"Carbohydrates\"/> Grain mixes with added molasses are usually called \"sweet feed\" in the United States and \"coarse mix\" in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Pelleted]] or ''extruded'' feeds (sometimes referred to as \"nuts\" in the UK) may be easier to chew and result in less wasted feed. Horses generally eat pellets as easily as grain. However, pellets are also more expensive, and even \"complete\" rations do not eliminate the necessity for forage.<ref name=\"Briggs\">[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=635 Briggs, Karen. \"Pelleted Feeds: Packaged Nutrition.\" ''The Horse'', October 1, 1997]</ref>\n\n====Supplements====\nThe average modern horse on good hay or pasture with light work usually does not need supplements; however, horses subjected to stress due to age, intensive athletic work, or reproduction may need additional nutrition.<ref name=\"Penn\"/> Extra fat and protein are sometimes added to the horse's diet, along with vitamin and mineral supplements.<ref name=\"fat\"/> There are hundreds, if not thousands of commercially prepared vitamin and mineral supplements on the market, many tailored to horses with specialized needs.\n\n[[Soybean]] meal is a common protein supplement, and averages about 44% crude protein. The protein in soybean meal is high-quality, with the proper ratio of dietary essential [[amino acid]]s for equids.  [[Cottonseed]] meal, [[Linseed]] meal, and peanut meal are also used, but are not as common.<ref name=\"Protein\"/>\n\n==Feeding practices==\n[[File:PelletRation.jpg|thumb|200px|A pelleted or ''extruded'' horse ration contains grain and other plant products, plus vitamin and mineral supplements.]]\nMost horses only need quality forage, water, and a salt or mineral block.<ref name=\"Purdue\"/> Grain or other concentrates are often not necessary.<ref name=\"March\"/>  But, when grain or other concentrates are fed, quantities must be carefully monitored. To do so, horse feed is measured by weight, not volume.  For example, {{convert|1|lb|abbr=on}} of oats has a different volume than {{convert|1|lb|abbr=on}} of corn.<ref name=\"Rutgers\"/> When continuous access to feed is not possible, it is more consistent with natural feeding behavior to provide three small feedings per day instead of one or two large ones.  However, even two daily feedings is preferable to only one.<ref name=\"Nevada\"/> To gauge the amount to feed, a weight tape can be used to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of a horse's weight.  The tape measures the circumference of the horse's [[horse anatomy|barrel]], just behind the withers and elbows, and the tape is calibrated to convert circumference into approximate weight.\n\nActual amounts fed vary by the size of the horse, the age of the horse, the climate, and the work to which the animal is put.<ref>Giles SR, Rands SA, Nicol CJ, Harris PA. Obesity prevalence and associated risk factors in outdoor living domestic horses and ponies. PeerJ. 2014;2:e299</ref>  In addition, [[Genetics|genetic]] factors play a role.  Some animals are naturally [[easy keeper]]s (good doers), which means that they can thrive on small amounts of food and are prone to [[obesity]] and other health problems if overfed.  Others are [[hard keeper]]s (poor doers), meaning that they are prone to be thin and require considerably more food to maintain a healthy weight.\n\n[[Veterinarian]]s are usually a good source for recommendations on appropriate types and amounts of feed for a specific horse.  Animal nutritionists are also trained in how to develop equine rations and make recommendations. There are also numerous books written on the topic.  Feed manufacturers usually offer very specific guidelines for how to select and properly feed products from their company, and in the [[United States]], the local office of the [[Cooperative Extension Service]] can provide educational materials and expert recommendations.\n\n===Feeding forages===\nEquids always require forage.  When possible, nutritionists recommend it be available at all times, at least when doing so does not overfeed the animal and lead to [[obesity]].  It is safe to feed a ration that is 100% forage<ref name=\"March\"/> (along with water and supplemental salt), and any feed ration should be at least 50% forage.<ref name=\"Feeding factors\"/> Hay with alfalfa or other legumes has more concentrated nutrition and so is fed in smaller amounts than grass hay, though many hays have a mixture of both types of plant.\n\nWhen [[beet pulp]] is fed, a ration of {{convert|2|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|5|lb|abbr=on}} is usually soaked in water for 3 to 4 hours prior to feeding in order to make it more palatable, and to minimize the risk of choke and other problems.  It is usually soaked in a proportion of one part beet pulp to two parts water.  Beet pulp is usually fed in addition to hay, but occasionally is a replacement for hay when fed to very old horses who can no longer chew properly.<ref name=\"Myths\"/> It is available in both pelleted and shredded form, pellets must be soaked significantly longer than shredded beet pulp.\n\nSome pelleted rations are designed to be a \"complete\" feed that contains both hay and grain, meeting all the horse's nutritional needs.  However, even these rations should have some hay or pasture provided, a minimum of a half-pound of forage for every {{convert|100|lb|abbr=on}} of horse, in order to keep the digestive system functioning properly and to meet the horse's urge to graze.<ref name=\"Briggs\"/>\n\nWhen horses graze under natural conditions, they may spend up to 18 hours per day doing so.<ref>Blikslager, Anthony. \"Avoiding Colic Through Management.\" ''The Horse'' July 2008: 47-54.</ref>  However, on modern irrigated pastures, they may have their nutritional needs for forage met in as little as three hours per day, depending on the quality of grass available.\n\nRecent studies address the level of various [[non-structural carbohydrate]]s (NSC), such as [[fructan]], in forages.  Too high an NSC level causes difficulties for animals prone to [[laminitis]] or [[equine polysaccharide storage myopathy]] (EPSM).  NSC cannot be determined by looking at forage, but hay and pasture grasses can be tested for NSC levels.<ref>[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=9587 Watts, Kathryn. \"Finding and Testing Low-Sugar Forage,\" ''The Horse'' Web site, accessed May 16, 2007.]</ref>\n\n===Feeding concentrates===\nConcentrates, when fed, are recommended to be provided in quantities no greater than 1% of a horse's body weight per day,<ref name=\"Penn\"/> and preferably in two or more feedings.<ref name=\"Rutgers\"/>  If a ration needs to contain a higher percent of concentrates, such as that of a [[horse racing|race horse]], bulky grains such as oats should be used as much as possible; a loose mass of feed helps prevent impaction colic.<ref name=\"LSU\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070504152819/http://www.lsuagcenter.com/en/crops_livestock/livestock/horses/Nutrition/Nutrition+Feed.htm Depew, Clint. \"Proper Nutrition,\" LSUAgCenter.] Web site accessed March 13, 2007</ref> [[Peptic ulcer]]s are linked to a too-high concentration of grain in the diet, particularly noticed in modern racehorses, where some studies show such ulcers affecting up to 90% of all race horses.<ref>[http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/info_gastric.htm Gastric Ulcers in the Adult Horse]</ref>\n\nIn general, the portion of the ration that should be grain or other concentrated feed is 0-10% grain for mature idle horses; between 20-70% for horses at work, depending on age, intensity of activity, and energy requirements.<ref name=\"Feeding factors\"/> Concentrates should not be fed to horses within one hour before or after a heavy workout.<ref name=\"March\"/> Concentrates also need to be adjusted to level of performance.<ref name=\"Purdue\"/> Not only can excess grain and inadequate exercise lead to behavior problems,<ref name=\"Myths\"/> it may also trigger serious health problems that include [[Equine Exertional Rhabdomyolysis]], or \"tying up,\" in horses prone to the condition.<ref name=\"LSU\"/> Another possible risk are various forms of [[horse colic]]. A relatively uncommon, but usually fatal concern is [[colitis-X]], which may be triggered by excess protein and lack of forage in the diet that allows for the multiplication of [[Clostridium|clostridial]] organisms, and is exacerbated by stress.<ref name=Schiefer>{{cite journal|author=Schiefer, H. B. |title= Equine Colitis \"X\", Still an Enigma?|journal=Can Vet J |date=May 1981|issue=5|pages= 162\u2013165|pmid= 6265055|volume= 22|pmc= 1790040}}</ref>\n\n===Access to water===\nHorses normally require free access to all the fresh, clean [[water]] they want, and to avoid dehydration, should not be kept from water longer than four hours at any one time.<ref>\"Waiting for Water,\" from column, \"Ask Horse Journal.\" ''Horse Journal,'' August, 2007, p. 23</ref> However, water may need to be temporarily limited in quantity when a horse is very hot after a heavy workout. As long as a hot horse continues to work, it can drink its fill at periodic intervals, provided that common sense is used and that an overheated horse is not forced to drink from extremely cold water sources.  But when the workout is over, a horse needs to be cooled out and walked for 30\u201390 minutes before it can be allowed all the water it wants at one time. However, dehydration is also a concern, so some water needs to be offered during the cooling off process.  A hot horse will properly rehydrate while cooling off if offered a few swallows of water every three to five minutes while being walked.  Sometimes the thirst mechanism does not immediately kick in following a heavy workout, which is another reason to offer periodic refills of water throughout the cooling down period.<ref name=\"water\"/><ref name=\"Myths\"/>\n\nEven a slightly dehydrated horse is at higher risk of developing impaction [[horse colic|colic]]. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed.<ref name=\"Kane\"/> Thus, it is especially important for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add [[electrolytes]] to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.<ref name=\"Kane\"/>\n\n===Special feeding issues for ponies===\n{{Main|Pony|Miniature horse}}\n[[File:Gracie-rhs2005.jpg|thumb|Ponies need less feed than full-sized horses]]\n[[Pony|Ponies]] and [[miniature horse]]s are usually [[easy keeper]]s and need less feed than full-sized horses.  This is not only because they are smaller, but also, because they evolved under harsher living conditions than horses, they use feed more efficiently.<ref name=\"Pony\">[http://www.horses-and-horse-information.com/articles/0401ponyportions.shtml \"Don\u2019t Over Feed Your Pony: Ponies Need Smaller Portions than Horses for Proper Nutrition,\" ''Horses and Horse Information.''

[http://horses.about.com/od/feedingyourhorse/a/feedingponies.htm \"Feeding Your Pony\"] Web site accessed March 13, 2007.</ref>\n\nIncorrect feeding is also as much a concern as simple overfeeding. Ponies and miniatures need a diet relatively low in sugars and starches and calories, but higher in fibers.   Miniature horses in particular need fewer calories pound for pound than a regular horse, and are more prone to [[hyperlipemia]] than regular horses, and are also at higher risk of developing [[equine metabolic syndrome]].<ref name=\"King\"/>\n\nIt is important to track the weight of a pony carefully, by use of a weight tape.  Forages may be fed based on weight, at a rate of about {{convert|1|lb|abbr=on}} of forage for every {{convert|100|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Pony\"/>  Forage, along with water and a salt and mineral block, is all most ponies require.  If a hard-working pony needs concentrates, a ratio of no more than 30% concentrates to 70% forage is recommended.<ref name=\"Pony2\"/> Concentrates designed for horses, with added vitamins and minerals, will often provide insufficient nutrients at the small serving sizes needed for ponies. Therefore, if a pony requires concentrates, feed and supplements designed specially for ponies should be used.<ref name=\"Pony\"/>  In the UK, extruded pellets designed for ponies are sometimes called \"pony nuts\".<ref name=\"Pony2\"/>\n\n===Special feeding issues for mules and donkeys===\n{{Main|Donkey|Mule}}\n[[File:Adopted Burro.jpg|thumb|left|Donkeys and mules need less concentrated feed than horses]]\nLike ponies, [[mule]]s and [[donkey]]s are also very hardy and generally need less concentrated feed than horses.

They can meet their nutritional needs on 6 to 7 hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought. If they are worked long hours or do not have access to pasture, they require hay or a similar dried forage, with no more than a 1:4 ratio of legumes to grass.  They also require salt and mineral supplements, and access to clean, fresh water.<ref>Aganga, A.A., ''et al.''

There are also behavioral issues that some horses may develop if given too many treats, particularly a tendency to bite if hand-fed, and for this reason many horse trainers and riding instructors discourage the practice.<ref>\"The Debate Over Treats.\" ''Equus'' no. 345, June 2006, p. 42</ref>\n\nHowever, if treats are allowed, carrots and compressed hay pellets are common, nutritious, and generally not harmful.  Apples are also acceptable, though it is best if they are first cut into slices.  Horse \"cookies\" are often specially manufactured out of ordinary grains and some added molasses.  They generally will not cause nutritional problems when fed in small quantities.   However, many types of human foods are potentially dangerous to a horse and should not be fed.  This includes bread products, meat products, candy, and carbonated or alcoholic beverages.\n\nIt was once a common practice to give horses a weekly ''bran mash'' of wheat bran mixed with warm water and other ingredients.  It is still done regularly in some places.  While a warm, soft meal is a treat many horses enjoy, and was once considered helpful for its laxative effect, it is not nutritionally necessary.  An old horse with poor teeth may benefit from food softened in water, a mash may help provide extra [[Tissue hydration|hydration]], and a warm meal may be comforting in cold weather, but horses have far more fiber in their regular diet than do humans, and so any assistance from bran is unnecessary. There is also a risk that too much wheat bran may provide excessive phosphorus, unbalancing the diet, and a feed of unusual contents fed only once a week could trigger a bout of colic.<ref name=\"Myths\"/>\n\n==Feed storage==\n[[File:Grass hay by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Hay stored in a shed to keep it dry]]\nAll hay and concentrated feeds must be kept dry and free of [[Mold (fungus)|mold]], [[rodent]] feces, and other types of contamination that may cause illness in horses.<ref name=\"March\"/> Feed kept outside or otherwise exposed to moisture can develop mold quite quickly.  Due to fire hazards, hay is often stored under an open shed or under a tarp, rather than inside a horse barn itself, but should be kept under some kind of cover.  Concentrates take up less storage space, are less of a fire hazard, and are usually kept in a barn or enclosed shed.  A secure door or latched gate between the animals and any feed storage area is critical.  Horses accidentally getting into stored feed and eating too much at one time is a common but preventable way that horses develop colic or laminitis.

Low-status animals, who eat last, may not get enough food, and if there is little available feed, higher-ranking horses may keep lower-ranking ones from eating at all.  Therefore, unless a herd is on pasture that meets the nutritional needs of all individuals, it is important to either feed horses separately,<ref name=\"Purdue\"/> or spread  feed out in separate areas to be sure all animals get roughly equal amounts of food to eat.  In some situations where horses are kept together, they may still be placed into separate herds, depending on nutritional needs; overweight horses are kept separate from thin horses so that rations may be adjusted accordingly.  Horses may also eat in undesirable ways, such as [[bolting (horse)|bolting]] their feed, or eating too fast.  This can lead to either choke or colic under some circumstances.\n\n==Dental issues==\n{{Main|Horse teeth}}\nHorses' [[horse teeth|teeth]] continually erupt throughout their life, are worn down as they eat, and can develop uneven wear patterns that can interfere with chewing.

The most common cause of choke is horses not chewing their food thoroughly, usually because of eating their food too quickly, especially if they do not have sufficient access to water, but also sometimes due to dental problems that make chewing painful. It is exceedingly difficult for a horse to expel anything from the esophagus, and immediate treatment is often required.

Equine nutritionists recommend that 50% or more of the animal's diet by weight should be [[forage]]s.<ref name=\"Feeding factors\"/>  If a horse is working hard and requires more energy, the use of [[grain]] is increased and the percentage of forage decreased so that the horse obtains the energy content it needs for the work it is performing.  However, forage amount should never go below 1% of the horse's body weight per day.<ref name=\"Penn\"/>\n\n===Forages===\n[[File:GrassHay1.jpg|thumb|Good quality grass hay is green and has visible leaves and young seed heads.]]\n[[Forage]]s, also known as \"roughage,\" are plant materials classified as [[legume]]s or [[grass]]es, found in [[pasture]]s or in [[hay]]. Often, pastures and hayfields will contain a blend of both grasses and legumes. Nutrients available in forage vary greatly with maturity of the grasses, fertilization, management, and environmental conditions.<ref name=\"Penn\"/> Grasses are tolerant of a wide range of conditions and contain most necessary nutrients.  Some commonly used grasses include [[Timothy-grass|timothy]], [[bromus|brome]], [[fescue]], [[Cynodon|coastal Bermuda]], [[orchard grass]], and [[Smooth Meadow-grass|Kentucky bluegrass]]. Another type of forage sometimes provided to horses is [[beet pulp]], a byproduct left over from the processing of [[sugar beet]]s, which is high in energy as well as fiber.<ref name=\"Myths\"/>\n\nLegumes such as [[clover]] or [[alfalfa]] are usually higher in [[protein]], [[calcium]], and energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good soil to produce the best nutrients. Legume hays are generally higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.<ref name=\"Carbohydrates\"/>\n\n[[Hay]] is a dried mixture of [[grass]]es and [[legume]]s. It is cut in the field and then dried and baled for storage.<ref name=\"Penn\"/>  Hay is most nutritious when it is cut early on, before the seed heads are fully mature and before the stems of the plants become tough and thick.  Hay that is very green can be a good indicator of the amount of nutrients in the hay; however, color is not the sole indicator of quality&mdash;smell and texture are also important.<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090708015558/http://ohioline.osu.edu/b762/b762_21.html \"Horse Nutrition - Hay quality.\" Bulletin 762-00, Ohio State University.] Web site accessed February 9, 2007</ref> Hay can be analyzed by many laboratories and that is the most reliable way to tell the nutritional values it contains.<ref name=\"Purdue\"/>\n\nHay, particularly alfalfa, is sometimes compressed into pellets or cubes.  Processed hay can be of more consistent quality and is more convenient to ship and to store.  It is also easily obtained in areas that may be suffering localized hay shortages.  However, these more concentrated forms can be overfed and horses are somewhat more prone to [[choke (horse)|choke]] on them. On the other hand, hay pellets and cubes can be soaked until they break apart into a pulp or thick slurry, and in this state are a very useful source of food for horses with [[horse teeth|tooth]] problems such as dental disease, tooth loss due to age, or structural anomalies.\n\n''Haylage'', also known as ''Round bale silage'' is a term for grass sealed in airtight plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the [[United Kingdom]] and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States.<ref name=\"Pony2\">[http://www.vetschool.bris.ac.uk/schools/petcare/ponycare/page_06.htm Pony Care:Feeding the pony/horse.  Web site, accessed March 13, 2007]</ref> Because haylage is a type of [[silage]], hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale.<ref name=\"Haylage\"/> If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent [[botulism]] toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.\n\nSometimes, [[straw]] or [[chaff]] is fed to animals. However, this is roughage with little nutritional value other than providing fiber.<ref name=\"Mackay\">[http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/180474/practical-feeding-of-horses.pdf Mackay, Bruce.  \"Practical feeding of horses\" PRIMEFACT 425 September, 2007, New South Wales, Department of Primary Industries.]  Web site accessed July 25, 2008</ref>  It is sometimes used as a filler; it can slow down horses who eat their grain too fast, or it can provide additional fiber when the horse must meet most nutritional needs via concentrated feeds.<ref name=\"Mackay\"/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212744/http://www.hygain.com.au/News/ChafforNoChaff.htm \"Chaff or no Chaff?\"] ''Hygain news,'' web site accessed July 4, 2009.</ref> Straw is more often used as a bedding in stalls to absorb wastes.\n{{See also|forage|hay}}\n\n===Concentrates===\n[[File:Haverkorrels Avena sativa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Oats]]\n[[File:GrainMix.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A premixed ration of crimped corn, oats, barley and pelleted supplement]]\n\n====Grains====\nWhole or crushed [[grain]]s are the most common form of concentrated feed, sometimes referred to generically as \"oats\" or \"corn\" even if those grains are not present, also sometimes called ''straights'' in the [[UK]].\n\n[[Oat]]s are the most popular [[grain]] for horses. Oats have a lower digestible energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains. They form a loose mass in the stomach that is well suited to the equine digestive system. They are also more palatable and digestible than other grains.<ref name=\"Carbohydrates\"/><ref name=\"Horse sense\"/>\n\n[[Barley]] is also fed to horses, but needs to be processed to crack the seed hull and allow easier digestibility.<ref name=\"Carbohydrates\"/> It is frequently fed in combination with oats and corn, a mix informally referred to by the acronym \"COB\" (for Corn, Oats and Barley).\n\n[[Wheat]] is generally not used as a concentrate.  However, [[wheat bran]] is sometimes added to the diet of a horse for supplemental nutrition, usually moistened and in the form of a bran mash.<ref name=\"Carbohydrates\"/>  Wheat bran is high in phosphorus, so must be fed carefully so that it does not cause an imbalance in the Ca:P ratio of a ration <ref>https://thehorse.com/19261/risks-associated-with-feeding-horses-traditional-bran-mashes/</ref>.  Once touted for a laxative effect, this use of bran is now considered unnecessary, as horses, unlike humans, obtain sufficient fiber in their diets from other sources.<ref name=\"Myths\"/>\n\n====Mixes and pellets====\nMany feed manufacturers combine various grains and add additional vitamin and mineral supplements to create a complete premixed feed that is easy for owners to feed and of predictable nutritional quality.<ref name=\"Horse sense\"/>  Some of these prepared feeds are manufactured in pelleted form, others retain the grains in their original form. In many cases [[molasses]] is used as a binder to keep down dust and for increased palatability.<ref name=\"Carbohydrates\"/> Grain mixes with added molasses are usually called \"sweet feed\" in the United States and \"coarse mix\" in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Pelleted]] or ''extruded'' feeds (sometimes referred to as \"nuts\" in the UK) may be easier to chew and result in less wasted feed. Horses generally eat pellets as easily as grain. However, pellets are also more expensive, and even \"complete\" rations do not eliminate the necessity for forage.<ref name=\"Briggs\">[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=635 Briggs, Karen. \"Pelleted Feeds: Packaged Nutrition.\" ''The Horse'', October 1, 1997]</ref>\n\n====Supplements====\nThe average modern horse on good hay or pasture with light work usually does not need supplements; however, horses subjected to stress due to age, intensive athletic work, or reproduction may need additional nutrition.<ref name=\"Penn\"/> Extra fat and protein are sometimes added to the horse's diet, along with vitamin and mineral supplements.<ref name=\"fat\"/> There are hundreds, if not thousands of commercially prepared vitamin and mineral supplements on the market, many tailored to horses with specialized needs.\n\n[[Soybean]] meal is a common protein supplement, and averages about 44% crude protein. The protein in soybean meal is high-quality, with the proper ratio of dietary essential [[amino acid]]s for equids.  [[Cottonseed]] meal, [[Linseed]] meal, and peanut meal are also used, but are not as common.<ref name=\"Protein\"/>\n\n==Feeding practices==\n[[File:PelletRation.jpg|thumb|200px|A pelleted or ''extruded'' horse ration contains grain and other plant products, plus vitamin and mineral supplements.]]\nMost horses only need quality forage, water, and a salt or mineral block.<ref name=\"Purdue\"/> Grain or other concentrates are often not necessary.<ref name=\"March\"/>  But, when grain or other concentrates are fed, quantities must be carefully monitored. To do so, horse feed is measured by weight, not volume.  For example, {{convert|1|lb|abbr=on}} of oats has a different volume than {{convert|1|lb|abbr=on}} of corn.<ref name=\"Rutgers\"/> When continuous access to feed is not possible, it is more consistent with natural feeding behavior to provide three small feedings per day instead of one or two large ones.  However, even two daily feedings is preferable to only one.<ref name=\"Nevada\"/> To gauge the amount to feed, a weight tape can be used to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of a horse's weight.  The tape measures the circumference of the horse's [[horse anatomy|barrel]], just behind the withers and elbows, and the tape is calibrated to convert circumference into approximate weight.\n\nActual amounts fed vary by the size of the horse, the age of the horse, the climate, and the work to which the animal is put.<ref>Giles SR, Rands SA, Nicol CJ, Harris PA. Obesity prevalence and associated risk factors in outdoor living domestic horses and ponies. PeerJ. 2014;2:e299</ref>  In addition, [[Genetics|genetic]] factors play a role.  Some animals are naturally [[easy keeper]]s (good doers), which means that they can thrive on small amounts of food and are prone to [[obesity]] and other health problems if overfed.  Others are [[hard keeper]]s (poor doers), meaning that they are prone to be thin and require considerably more food to maintain a healthy weight.\n\n[[Veterinarian]]s are usually a good source for recommendations on appropriate types and amounts of feed for a specific horse.  Animal nutritionists are also trained in how to develop equine rations and make recommendations. There are also numerous books written on the topic.  Feed manufacturers usually offer very specific guidelines for how to select and properly feed products from their company, and in the [[United States]], the local office of the [[Cooperative Extension Service]] can provide educational materials and expert recommendations.\n\n===Feeding forages===\nEquids always require forage.  When possible, nutritionists recommend it be available at all times, at least when doing so does not overfeed the animal and lead to [[obesity]].  It is safe to feed a ration that is 100% forage<ref name=\"March\"/> (along with water and supplemental salt), and any feed ration should be at least 50% forage.<ref name=\"Feeding factors\"/> Hay with alfalfa or other legumes has more concentrated nutrition and so is fed in smaller amounts than grass hay, though many hays have a mixture of both types of plant.\n\nWhen [[beet pulp]] is fed, a ration of {{convert|2|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|5|lb|abbr=on}} is usually soaked in water for 3 to 4 hours prior to feeding in order to make it more palatable, and to minimize the risk of choke and other problems.  It is usually soaked in a proportion of one part beet pulp to two parts water.  Beet pulp is usually fed in addition to hay, but occasionally is a replacement for hay when fed to very old horses who can no longer chew properly.<ref name=\"Myths\"/> It is available in both pelleted and shredded form, pellets must be soaked significantly longer than shredded beet pulp.\n\nSome pelleted rations are designed to be a \"complete\" feed that contains both hay and grain, meeting all the horse's nutritional needs.  However, even these rations should have some hay or pasture provided, a minimum of a half-pound of forage for every {{convert|100|lb|abbr=on}} of horse, in order to keep the digestive system functioning properly and to meet the horse's urge to graze.<ref name=\"Briggs\"/>\n\nWhen horses graze under natural conditions, they may spend up to 18 hours per day doing so.<ref>Blikslager, Anthony. \"Avoiding Colic Through Management.\" ''The Horse'' July 2008: 47-54.</ref>  However, on modern irrigated pastures, they may have their nutritional needs for forage met in as little as three hours per day, depending on the quality of grass available.\n\nRecent studies address the level of various [[non-structural carbohydrate]]s (NSC), such as [[fructan]], in forages.  Too high an NSC level causes difficulties for animals prone to [[laminitis]] or [[equine polysaccharide storage myopathy]] (EPSM).  NSC cannot be determined by looking at forage, but hay and pasture grasses can be tested for NSC levels.<ref>[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=9587 Watts, Kathryn. \"Finding and Testing Low-Sugar Forage,\" ''The Horse'' Web site, accessed May 16, 2007.]</ref>\n\n===Feeding concentrates===\nConcentrates, when fed, are recommended to be provided in quantities no greater than 1% of a horse's body weight per day,<ref name=\"Penn\"/> and preferably in two or more feedings.<ref name=\"Rutgers\"/>  If a ration needs to contain a higher percent of concentrates, such as that of a [[horse racing|race horse]], bulky grains such as oats should be used as much as possible; a loose mass of feed helps prevent impaction colic.<ref name=\"LSU\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070504152819/http://www.lsuagcenter.com/en/crops_livestock/livestock/horses/Nutrition/Nutrition+Feed.htm Depew, Clint. \"Proper Nutrition,\" LSUAgCenter.] Web site accessed March 13, 2007</ref> [[Peptic ulcer]]s are linked to a too-high concentration of grain in the diet, particularly noticed in modern racehorses, where some studies show such ulcers affecting up to 90% of all race horses.<ref>[http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/info_gastric.htm Gastric Ulcers in the Adult Horse]</ref>\n\nIn general, the portion of the ration that should be grain or other concentrated feed is 0-10% grain for mature idle horses; between 20-70% for horses at work, depending on age, intensity of activity, and energy requirements.<ref name=\"Feeding factors\"/> Concentrates should not be fed to horses within one hour before or after a heavy workout.<ref name=\"March\"/> Concentrates also need to be adjusted to level of performance.<ref name=\"Purdue\"/> Not only can excess grain and inadequate exercise lead to behavior problems,<ref name=\"Myths\"/> it may also trigger serious health problems that include [[Equine Exertional Rhabdomyolysis]], or \"tying up,\" in horses prone to the condition.<ref name=\"LSU\"/> Another possible risk are various forms of [[horse colic]]. A relatively uncommon, but usually fatal concern is [[colitis-X]], which may be triggered by excess protein and lack of forage in the diet that allows for the multiplication of [[Clostridium|clostridial]] organisms, and is exacerbated by stress.<ref name=Schiefer>{{cite journal|author=Schiefer, H.

As long as a hot horse continues to work, it can drink its fill at periodic intervals, provided that common sense is used and that an overheated horse is not forced to drink from extremely cold water sources.  But when the workout is over, a horse needs to be cooled out and walked for 30\u201390 minutes before it can be allowed all the water it wants at one time. However, dehydration is also a concern, so some water needs to be offered during the cooling off process.  A hot horse will properly rehydrate while cooling off if offered a few swallows of water every three to five minutes while being walked.  Sometimes the thirst mechanism does not immediately kick in following a heavy workout, which is another reason to offer periodic refills of water throughout the cooling down period.<ref name=\"water\"/><ref name=\"Myths\"/>\n\nEven a slightly dehydrated horse is at higher risk of developing impaction [[horse colic|colic]]. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed.<ref name=\"Kane\"/> Thus, it is especially important for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add [[electrolytes]] to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.<ref name=\"Kane\"/>\n\n===Special feeding issues for ponies===\n{{Main|Pony|Miniature horse}}\n[[File:Gracie-rhs2005.jpg|thumb|Ponies need less feed than full-sized horses]]\n[[Pony|Ponies]] and [[miniature horse]]s are usually [[easy keeper]]s and need less feed than full-sized horses.  This is not only because they are smaller, but also, because they evolved under harsher living conditions than horses, they use feed more efficiently.<ref name=\"Pony\">[http://www.horses-and-horse-information.com/articles/0401ponyportions.shtml \"Don\u2019t Over Feed Your Pony: Ponies Need Smaller Portions than Horses for Proper Nutrition,\" ''Horses and Horse Information.''

[http://horses.about.com/od/feedingyourhorse/a/feedingponies.htm \"Feeding Your Pony\"] Web site accessed March 13, 2007.</ref>\n\nIncorrect feeding is also as much a concern as simple overfeeding. Ponies and miniatures need a diet relatively low in sugars and starches and calories, but higher in fibers.   Miniature horses in particular need fewer calories pound for pound than a regular horse, and are more prone to [[hyperlipemia]] than regular horses, and are also at higher risk of developing [[equine metabolic syndrome]].<ref name=\"King\"/>\n\nIt is important to track the weight of a pony carefully, by use of a weight tape.  Forages may be fed based on weight, at a rate of about {{convert|1|lb|abbr=on}} of forage for every {{convert|100|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Pony\"/>  Forage, along with water and a salt and mineral block, is all most ponies require.  If a hard-working pony needs concentrates, a ratio of no more than 30% concentrates to 70% forage is recommended.<ref name=\"Pony2\"/> Concentrates designed for horses, with added vitamins and minerals, will often provide insufficient nutrients at the small serving sizes needed for ponies. Therefore, if a pony requires concentrates, feed and supplements designed specially for ponies should be used.<ref name=\"Pony\"/>  In the UK, extruded pellets designed for ponies are sometimes called \"pony nuts\".<ref name=\"Pony2\"/>\n\n===Special feeding issues for mules and donkeys===\n{{Main|Donkey|Mule}}\n[[File:Adopted Burro.jpg|thumb|left|Donkeys and mules need less concentrated feed than horses]]\nLike ponies, [[mule]]s and [[donkey]]s are also very hardy and generally need less concentrated feed than horses.

There are also behavioral issues that some horses may develop if given too many treats, particularly a tendency to bite if hand-fed, and for this reason many horse trainers and riding instructors discourage the practice.<ref>\"The Debate Over Treats.\" ''Equus'' no. 345, June 2006, p. 42</ref>\n\nHowever, if treats are allowed, carrots and compressed hay pellets are common, nutritious, and generally not harmful.  Apples are also acceptable, though it is best if they are first cut into slices.  Horse \"cookies\" are often specially manufactured out of ordinary grains and some added molasses.  They generally will not cause nutritional problems when fed in small quantities.   However, many types of human foods are potentially dangerous to a horse and should not be fed.  This includes bread products, meat products, candy, and carbonated or alcoholic beverages.\n\nIt was once a common practice to give horses a weekly ''bran mash'' of wheat bran mixed with warm water and other ingredients.  It is still done regularly in some places.  While a warm, soft meal is a treat many horses enjoy, and was once considered helpful for its laxative effect, it is not nutritionally necessary.  An old horse with poor teeth may benefit from food softened in water, a mash may help provide extra [[Tissue hydration|hydration]], and a warm meal may be comforting in cold weather, but horses have far more fiber in their regular diet than do humans, and so any assistance from bran is unnecessary. There is also a risk that too much wheat bran may provide excessive phosphorus, unbalancing the diet, and a feed of unusual contents fed only once a week could trigger a bout of colic.<ref name=\"Myths\"/>\n\n==Feed storage==\n[[File:Grass hay by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Hay stored in a shed to keep it dry]]\nAll hay and concentrated feeds must be kept dry and free of [[mold]], [[rodent]] feces, and other types of contamination that may cause illness in horses.<ref name=\"March\"/> Feed kept outside or otherwise exposed to moisture can develop mold quite quickly.  Due to fire hazards, hay is often stored under an open shed or under a tarp, rather than inside a horse barn itself, but should be kept under some kind of cover.  Concentrates take up less storage space, are less of a fire hazard, and are usually kept in a barn or enclosed shed.  A secure door or latched gate between the animals and any feed storage area is critical.  Horses accidentally getting into stored feed and eating too much at one time is a common but preventable way that horses develop colic or laminitis.  (''see'' [[#Illnesses related to improper feeding|Illnesses related to improper feeding]] ''below'')\n\nIt is generally not safe to give a horse feed that was contaminated by the remains of a dead animal.  This is a potential source of [[botulism]].<ref>Heusner, Gary. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060906075124/http://www.ces.uga.edu/Agriculture/asdsvm/LVSeptOct2001.pdf \"Horse Feed Quality and Contamination\"] (PDF) Web site accessed July 4, 2009.</ref> This is not an uncommon situation.  For example, [[mouse|mice]] and [[bird]]s can get into poorly stored grain and be trapped; hay bales sometimes accidentally contain [[snake]]s, mice, or other small animals that were caught in the [[hay|baling]] machinery during the harvesting process.\n\n==Feeding behavior==\nHorses can become anxious or stressed if there are long periods of time between meals. They also do best when they are fed on a regular schedule; they are creatures of habit and easily upset by changes in routine.<ref name=\"Rutgers\"/>  When horses are in a herd, their [[horse behavior|behavior]] is hierarchical;<ref>[http://www.esc.rutgers.edu/publications/general/fs525.htm Williams, Carey A.Ph.D., Extension Specialist. \"The Basics of Equine Behavior,\" FS #525 ''from''  Equine Science Center, Rutgers University, 2004.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407081251/http://esc.rutgers.edu/publications/general/fs525.htm |date=2007-04-07 }}  Web site accessed February 14, 2007</ref> the higher-ranked animals in the herd eat and drink first.  Low-status animals, who eat last, may not get enough food, and if there is little available feed, higher-ranking horses may keep lower-ranking ones from eating at all.  Therefore, unless a herd is on pasture that meets the nutritional needs of all individuals, it is important to either feed horses separately,<ref name=\"Purdue\"/> or spread  feed out in separate areas to be sure all animals get roughly equal amounts of food to eat.  In some situations where horses are kept together, they may still be placed into separate herds, depending on nutritional needs; overweight horses are kept separate from thin horses so that rations may be adjusted accordingly.  Horses may also eat in undesirable ways, such as [[bolting (horse)|bolting]] their feed, or eating too fast.  This can lead to either choke or colic under some circumstances.\n\n==Dental issues==\n{{Main|Horse teeth}}\nHorses' [[horse teeth|teeth]] continually erupt throughout their life, are worn down as they eat, and can develop uneven wear patterns that can interfere with chewing.  For this reason, horses need a [[horse care|dental examination]] at least once a year, and particular care must be paid to the dental needs of older horses.<ref>[http://www.admani.com/Horse/Equine%20Library/Horse%20The%20Old%20Horse%20Dilemma.htm  Reynolds, Judith A, Ph.D., P.A.S. \"The 'Old Horse' Dilemma,\" ADM Alliance Nutrition.] Web site accessed June 6, 2012</ref> The process of grinding off uneven wear patterns on a horse's teeth is called ''floating'' and can be performed by a [[veterinarian]] or a specialist in equine dentistry.\n\n==Illnesses related to improper feeding==\nColic, choke, and laminitis can be life-threatening when a horse is severely affected, and [[veterinarian|veterinary]] care is necessary to properly treat these conditions.<ref>[http://www.ces.purdue.edu/extmedia/AS/AS_555_W.pdf Brady.

But colic has many other possible triggers including insufficient water, an irregular feeding schedule, stress, and illness.<ref>[http://www.uky.edu/Ag/AnimalSciences/pubs/asc128.pdf \"Colic in Horses\" Cooperative Extension Service, University of Kentucky, College of Agriculture.]  Web site accessed March 13, 2007</ref>  Because the horse cannot vomit and has a limited capacity to detoxify harmful substances, anything upsetting to the horse must travel all the way through the digestive system to be expelled.\n\n===Choke===\n{{Main|Choke (horse)}}\n[[Choke (horse)|Choke]] is not as common as colic, but is nonetheless commonly considered a veterinary emergency.  The most common cause of choke is horses not chewing their food thoroughly, usually because of eating their food too quickly, especially if they do not have sufficient access to water, but also sometimes due to dental problems that make chewing painful. It is exceedingly difficult for a horse to expel anything from the esophagus, and immediate treatment is often required. Unlike choking in humans, choke in horses does not cut off respiration.<ref name=\"Vet handbook\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.horse-previews.com/0600articles/vetcorner0600.html |title=Franklin, Frosty, DVM. \"Veterinary Corner 06/00: Esophageal Obstruction\"  Web site, accessed March 13, 2007 |access-date=March 13, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930203653/http://www.horse-previews.com/0600articles/vetcorner0600.html |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Laminitis===\n{{Main|Laminitis}}\nHorses are also susceptible to [[laminitis]], a disease of the lamina of the [[horse hoof|hoof]].
