Later, in 1944, he was appointed as head of the German Military Administration in the puppet state of the [[Italian Social Republic|Republic of Sal\u00f2]] in Italy. During the last two months of the war, he was responsible for the non-German forces at the [[Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA) in Berlin.\n\nIn 1940 68,000 [[Jew]]s were expelled from Krak\u00f3w and in 1941 the [[Krak\u00f3w Ghetto]] was created for the remaining 15,000 Jews by his [[decree]]s. On 28 September 1946 the Polish government requested the Military Governor of the United States Zone that W\u00e4chter be delivered to Poland for trial for \"mass murder, shooting and executions. Under his command of District Galicia more than one hundred thousand Polish citizens lost their lives.\"\n\nHe managed to evade the Allied authorities for 4 years.

His father, Joseph Freiherr von W\u00e4chter, was born in northern [[Bohemia]] and served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In the last year of the [[First World War]], Joseph Freiherr von W\u00e4chter was decorated with the [[Order of Maria Theresia|Knight's Cross of the Order of Maria Theresia]], which earned him the title of [[Freiherr]] (Baron).\n\nIn 1922, after the [[First Austrian Republic]] was established, he was twice nominated as Minister of Defence in the Cabinet of Monsignor Dr [[Ignaz Seipel]]. W\u00e4chter spent his first years in Vienna before the family moved to [[Trieste]] (then part of Austria-Hungary) in 1908. For the duration of World War I he lived in southern Bohemia, studying and taking his A-levels in 1919 in [[\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice]], where everyday life was dominated by the national differences between Germans and Czechs.\n\nThe family moved to Vienna, where W\u00e4chter studied law and joined a number of diverse national and sporting organizations. In 1923 he joined the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and became Austrian Champion in M8+ (eight-man rowing team). He received his doctorate in 1925 and in 1929 began practicing as a lawyer. His clients included indicted members of the [[Nazi Party]], which he joined on 24 October 1930 (party No: 301093). On 11 September 1932, W\u00e4chter married Charlotte Bleckmann (born 20 October 1908), daughter of a [[Styria (Slovenia)|Styrian]] steel magnate.<ref>The pair eventually had six children, four daughters and two sons: Otto Richard (1933-1997) and Horst Arthur (born 1939).</ref>\n\nW\u00e4chter continued to work for the Nazi Party in Vienna as organizer and defender of accused Nazis in court and subsequently played a leading role in the organization of the failed [[July Putsch]] of 25 July 1934, which eventually led to the assassination of Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]]. After the failed coup, W\u00e4chter fled to Nazi Germany. He entered the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] on 1 January 1932, (SS No: 235368) and completed his German military service in [[Freising]], Bavaria. In 1935 his Austrian citizenship was denied and German citizenship conferred upon him while he completed his academic training and education as a lawyer in Germany. In 1937 he started working in the relief organization of Austrian NS-refugees in Berlin.\n\n==State Secretary in the Nazi government in Vienna==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nFollowing the \u201c[[Anschluss]]\u201d, (the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany) on 12 March 1938, W\u00e4chter held the post of state commissar in the \"Liquidation Ministry\" under the Nazi governor of Austria, [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]], from 24 May 1938 to 30 April 1939.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The government body he headed known as the \"W\u00e4chter-Kommission\", and responsible for the dismissal and/or compulsory retirement of all Austrian officials who did not conform with the Nazi regime.

Its capital city, variously known as [[Lviv|L'viv]] (Ukrainian), Lw\u00f3w (Polish) and Lemberg (German), had been - after Vienna, Budapest and Prague - the largest in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where Poles, Ukrainians and Jews had lived together for centuries. The first German governor was {{ill|Karl Lasch|de}}, an intimate friend of Frank, who was later arrested and shot for extensive black market activities on orders of Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS [[Heinrich Himmler]]. W\u00e4chter was chosen by [[Adolf Hitler]] \"as the best man on the spot\",<ref>{{ill|Melitta Wiedemann|de}}, W\u00e4chter Archive sound recording of Charlotte W\u00e4chter.</ref> and inserted as Governor on 22 January 1943.\n\nHis first official visit was to the influential and respected Greek Catholic Metropolit [[Andrey Sheptytsky|Andrij Aleksander Szeptycki]] (Sheptytsky). With his assistance W\u00e4chter endeavored to promote a greater degree of co-operation among the occupying Germans and the various ethnic elements in the district of Galicia. Consequently, he immediately found himself in conflict with SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer [[Friedrich-Wilhelm Kr\u00fcger]], the Reichsf\u00fchrer\u2019s representative in the General Government and executor of his planned large scale resettlement programs. At the government meeting in Krak\u00f3w on 17 February, W\u00e4chter publicly opposed plans to \"germanize\" the city of Lemberg, which would have resulted in the expulsion of its entire population stating: \u201cA German colonization of the East during the war would bring about the collapse of production.\u201d<ref>In a five page letter to W\u00e4chter, after emphasising that he was W\u00e4chter's senior in both age and rank, Kr\u00fcger reminded him that his recent public pronouncements on this issue were a direct confrontation to the policies of the Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS: \u201cEven though you wear the uniform of an SS Brigade Leader, in performing the tasks provided to you, you have never guided that you are members of the SS.\u201d{{Clarify|date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\nW\u00e4chter's continued opposition to Kr\u00fcger's policies led to a number of open confrontations. To avoid further altercations, Himmler offered W\u00e4chter the chance to relocate to Vienna, which he declined. As Governor of Galicia, while he remained a firm believer in the principle 'Germany first', his administration often went further to accommodate the wishes of the population than it was required to. He was frequently obliged to use his influence and connections by first circumventing General Governor Hans Frank and by exploiting the strained relations between Frank and Himmler to pursue his own policies. W\u00e4chter consciously selected men with liberal views for the key posts in his administration, notably his department heads Otto Bauer and Dr {{ill|Ludwig Losacker|de}}, with whom he consulted before deciding all important issues.<ref>Losacker p. 127.<br>Losacker was dismissed of all his functions on 10 October 1943 for defending Poles and put into an SS penal squad on the Italian front; Bauer was shot by a Soviet agent, [[Nikolai Iwanowitsch Kusnezow]], on 9 February 1944 in place of W\u00e4chter after W. had been warned by the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] underground organisation UPA, calling him \u201ca very decent human\u201c (written in italics in the original): letter 28 September 1943 in Archive W\u00e4chter.</ref>\n\nIn late 1942 W\u00e4chter visited the \u201c[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]\u201d (eastern Ukraine) to witness first hand the effect of the implementation of the Nazi ''[[Untermensch]]'' (subhuman) philosophy by Gauleiter [[Erich Koch]] and his policies of repression and subjugation. On his return in December 1942 he sent a secret ten page letter to [[Martin Bormann]] in the [[F\u00fchrer Headquarters]] in Berlin, criticizing the serious mistakes made in the handling of the Ukrainians.\n\nWhilst Governor of Galicia, he established a Waffen-SS Division recruited from the Ukrainian population of Galicia, under German supervision, to fight against the hated Bolsheviks. The formation of the unit was approved by Himmler after the disastrous German [[Battle of Stalingrad|defeat at Stalingrad]]. W\u00e4chter submitted the proposal to Himmler on 1 March 1943, and, on 28 April, the [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician)|SS Division ''Galicia'']] was publicly inaugurated.<ref>Despite mandatory enrolment requirements, on 30 October 1943 the Supplementary Office of the Waffen-SS produced the following breakdown for the registrations: Volunteered/Registered 80,000; called up for service 19,047; actually reported 13,245.</ref>\n\n==End of the war==\nWith the loss of the entire District of Galicia on 26 July 1944 to the advancing [[Red Army]], W\u00e4chter sought to be released from his administrative obligations in the General Government so that he could take up a position in the Waffen-SS.<ref>Letter: 28 July 1944 dzt Kracow, Gouverneur des Distrikits Galizien, An den Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS und Chef der Deutschen Polizei Reichsinnenminister Heinrich Himmler, NA T175, roll 32.</ref> In response Himmler agreed to order his release on the basis that he assume a new commission as \"Chief of the Military Administration to the Plenipotentiary General of the German Wehrmacht in Italy headed by SS-Obergruppenfuhrer [[Karl Wolff]].<ref>Wolff managed to shorten the war in Italy by six days through secret negotiations with [[Allan Foster Dulles|Allan F.

In so doing, on 30 January 1945 Himmler appointed W\u00e4chter as subsidiary head of the Group D of the [[Reich Main Security Office|RSHA]] in Berlin,<ref>Germanic and Volunteer Central Office in the RSHA. He arrived in Berlin on 26 February 1945.</ref> which sought to utilize and combine the [[Russian Liberation Army]] of General [[Andrey Vlasov]] and the newly formed [[Ukrainian National Army]] which included the 1st Ukrainian Division (formerly the SS 14th Galician Division), the creation of which he had instigated.\n\nVlasov's 'federalist' concept which required the subordination of all the other former Soviet nationalities to his overall command, proved to be an insurmountable obstacle for W\u00e4chter who was unable to bring about the unification of Vlasov and the separatist Ukrainians led by General [[Pavlo Shandruk]]. Nevertheless, W\u00e4chter redoubled his efforts with the Ukrainians whom he rejoined on 7 April 1945 in [[Carinthia]].<ref>Shandruk: 28. The 1st Ukrainian Division.</ref> On 8 May 1945, W\u00e4chter informed General Shandruk of the [[German Instrument of Surrender|unconditional surrender of the German Reich]] with the following words: \"Now, General, you are the central figure in the action of saving the Division, and possibly of all of us who are with you.\"<ref>Shandruk: 29.

He left them near [[Tamsweg]] in the [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg mountain district]] to avoid being taken prisoner and inevitable extradition to the Soviet Union. Together with a young member of the [[24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Karstj\u00e4ger|24th Waffen-Gebirgs-(Karstj\u00e4ger-) Division]] of the Waffen-SS, he successfully hid for 4 years, sustained by his wife who supplied both men with food and equipment from secret pick-up points. In the spring of 1949 W\u00e4chter crossed the border to [[South Tyrol]] in Italy where he met his wife and his elder children for the last time.\n\nOn 24 April 1949 he arrived in Rome, where, through pro-Nazi Bishop [[Alois Hudal]], rector of the Teutonic College of [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]], he found rudimentary accommodation in the clerical institute \u201cVigna Pia\u201d on the southern outskirts of Rome under the name of Alfredo Reinhardt. In June he took part in an Italian film, playing the part of an actor and was in the process of collecting information about a flight to South America. As a result of his daily morning swim in the polluted [[Tiber]] he appeared [[jaundiced]] on 3 July. On 9 July, he was taken to [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Santo Spirito Hospital]] near the Vatican where W\u00e4chter revealed his true identity.

His father, Joseph Freiherr von W\u00e4chter, was born in northern [[Bohemia]] and served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In the last year of the [[First World War]], Joseph Freiherr von W\u00e4chter was decorated with the [[Order of Maria Theresia|Knight's Cross of the Order of Maria Theresia]], which earned him the title of [[Freiherr]] (Baron).\n\nIn 1922, after the [[First Austrian Republic]] was established, he was twice nominated as Minister of Defence in the Cabinet of Monsignor Dr [[Ignaz Seipel]]. W\u00e4chter spent his first years in Vienna before the family moved to [[Trieste]] (then part of Austria-Hungary) in 1908. For the duration of World War I he lived in southern Bohemia, studying and taking his A-levels in 1919 in [[\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice]], where everyday life was dominated by the national differences between Germans and Czechs.\n\nThe family moved to Vienna, where W\u00e4chter studied law and joined a number of diverse national and sporting organizations. In 1923 he joined the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and became Austrian Champion in M8+ (eight-man rowing team). He received his doctorate in 1925 and in 1929 began practicing as a lawyer. His clients included indicted members of the [[Nazi Party]], which he joined on 24 October 1930 (party No: 301093). On 11 September 1932, W\u00e4chter married Charlotte Bleckmann (born 20 October 1908), daughter of a [[Styria (Slovenia)|Styrian]] steel magnate.<ref>The pair eventually had six children, four daughters and two sons: Otto Richard (1933-1997) and Horst Arthur (born 1939).</ref>\n\nW\u00e4chter continued to work for the Nazi Party in Vienna as organizer and defender of accused Nazis in court and subsequently played a leading role in the organization of the failed [[July Putsch]] of 25 July 1934, which eventually led to the assassination of Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]]. After the failed coup, W\u00e4chter fled to Nazi Germany. He entered the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] on 1 January 1932, (SS No: 235368) and completed his German military service in [[Freising]], Bavaria. In 1935 his Austrian citizenship was denied and German citizenship conferred upon him while he completed his academic training and education as a lawyer in Germany.

Its capital city, variously known as [[Lviv|L'viv]] (Ukrainian), Lw\u00f3w (Polish) and Lemberg (German), had been - after Vienna, Budapest and Prague - the largest in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where Poles, Ukrainians and Jews had lived together for centuries. The first German governor was {{ill|Karl Lasch|de}}, an intimate friend of Frank, who was later arrested and shot for extensive black market activities on orders of Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS [[Heinrich Himmler]]. W\u00e4chter was chosen by [[Adolf Hitler]] \"as the best man on the spot\",<ref>{{ill|Melitta Wiedemann|de}}, W\u00e4chter Archive sound recording of Charlotte W\u00e4chter.</ref> and inserted as Governor on 22 January 1943.\n\nHis first official visit was to the influential and respected Greek Catholic Metropolit [[Andrey Sheptytsky|Andrij Aleksander Szeptycki]] (Sheptytsky). With his assistance W\u00e4chter endeavored to promote a greater degree of co-operation among the occupying Germans and the various ethnic elements in the district of Galicia. Consequently, he immediately found himself in conflict with SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer [[Friedrich-Wilhelm Kr\u00fcger]], the Reichsf\u00fchrer\u2019s representative in the General Government and executor of his planned large scale resettlement programs. At the government meeting in Krak\u00f3w on 17 February, W\u00e4chter publicly opposed plans to \"germanize\" the city of Lemberg, which would have resulted in the expulsion of its entire population stating: \u201cA German colonization of the East during the war would bring about the collapse of production.\u201d<ref>In a five page letter to W\u00e4chter, after emphasising that he was W\u00e4chter's senior in both age and rank, Kr\u00fcger reminded him that his recent public pronouncements on this issue were a direct confrontation to the policies of the Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS: \u201cEven though you wear the uniform of an SS Brigade Leader, in performing the tasks provided to you, you have never guided that you are members of the SS.\u201d{{Clarify|date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\nW\u00e4chter's continued opposition to Kr\u00fcger's policies led to a number of open confrontations. To avoid further altercations, Himmler offered W\u00e4chter the chance to relocate to Vienna, which he declined. As Governor of Galicia, while he remained a firm believer in the principle 'Germany first', his administration often went further to accommodate the wishes of the population than it was required to. He was frequently obliged to use his influence and connections by first circumventing General Governor Hans Frank and by exploiting the strained relations between Frank and Himmler to pursue his own policies. W\u00e4chter consciously selected men with liberal views for the key posts in his administration, notably his department heads Otto Bauer and Dr {{ill|Ludwig Losacker|de}}, with whom he consulted before deciding all important issues.<ref>Losacker p. 127.<br>Losacker was dismissed of all his functions on 10 October 1943 for defending Poles and put into an SS penal squad on the Italian front; Bauer was shot by a Soviet agent, [[Nikolai Iwanowitsch Kusnezow]], on 9 February 1944 in place of W\u00e4chter after W. had been warned by the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] underground organisation UPA, calling him \u201ca very decent human\u201c (written in italics in the original): letter 28 September 1943 in Archive W\u00e4chter.</ref>\n\nIn late 1942 W\u00e4chter visited the \u201c[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]\u201d (eastern Ukraine) to witness first hand the effect of the implementation of the Nazi ''[[Untermensch]]'' (subhuman) philosophy by Gauleiter [[Erich Koch]] and his policies of repression and subjugation. On his return in December 1942 he sent a secret ten page letter to [[Martin Bormann]] in the [[F\u00fchrer Headquarters]] in Berlin, criticizing the serious mistakes made in the handling of the Ukrainians.\n\nWhilst Governor of Galicia, he established a Waffen-SS Division recruited from the Ukrainian population of Galicia, under German supervision, to fight against the hated Bolsheviks. The formation of the unit was approved by Himmler after the disastrous German [[Battle of Stalingrad|defeat at Stalingrad]]. W\u00e4chter submitted the proposal to Himmler on 1 March 1943, and, on 28 April, the [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician)|SS Division ''Galicia'']] was publicly inaugurated.<ref>Despite mandatory enrolment requirements, on 30 October 1943 the Supplementary Office of the Waffen-SS produced the following breakdown for the registrations: Volunteered/Registered 80,000; called up for service 19,047; actually reported 13,245.</ref>\n\n==End of the war==\nWith the loss of the entire District of Galicia on 26 July 1944 to the advancing [[Red Army]], W\u00e4chter sought to be released from his administrative obligations in the General Government so that he could take up a position in the Waffen-SS.<ref>Letter: 28 July 1944 dzt Kracow, Gouverneur des Distrikits Galizien, An den Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS und Chef der Deutschen Polizei Reichsinnenminister Heinrich Himmler, NA T175, roll 32.</ref> In response Himmler agreed to order his release on the basis that he assume a new commission as \"Chief of the Military Administration to the Plenipotentiary General of the German Wehrmacht in Italy headed by SS-Obergruppenfuhrer [[Karl Wolff]].<ref>Wolff managed to shorten the war in Italy by six days through secret negotiations with [[Allan Foster Dulles|Allan F.

In so doing, on 30 January 1945 Himmler appointed W\u00e4chter as subsidiary head of the Group D of the [[Reich Main Security Office|RSHA]] in Berlin,<ref>Germanic and Volunteer Central Office in the RSHA. He arrived in Berlin on 26 February 1945.</ref> which sought to utilize and combine the [[Russian Liberation Army]] of General [[Andrey Vlasov]] and the newly formed [[Ukrainian National Army]] which included the 1st Ukrainian Division (formerly the SS 14th Galician Division), the creation of which he had instigated.\n\nVlasov's 'federalist' concept which required the subordination of all the other former Soviet nationalities to his overall command, proved to be an insurmountable obstacle for W\u00e4chter who was unable to bring about the unification of Vlasov and the separatist Ukrainians led by General [[Pavlo Shandruk]]. Nevertheless, W\u00e4chter redoubled his efforts with the Ukrainians whom he rejoined on 7 April 1945 in [[Carinthia]].<ref>Shandruk: 28. The 1st Ukrainian Division.</ref> On 8 May 1945, W\u00e4chter informed General Shandruk of the [[German Instrument of Surrender|unconditional surrender of the German Reich]] with the following words: \"Now, General, you are the central figure in the action of saving the Division, and possibly of all of us who are with you.\"<ref>Shandruk: 29.

He left them near [[Tamsweg]] in the [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg mountain district]] to avoid being taken prisoner and inevitable extradition to the Soviet Union. Together with a young member of the [[24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Karstj\u00e4ger|24th Waffen-Gebirgs-(Karstj\u00e4ger-) Division]] of the Waffen-SS, he successfully hid for 4 years, sustained by his wife who supplied both men with food and equipment from secret pick-up points. In the spring of 1949 W\u00e4chter crossed the border to [[South Tyrol]] in Italy where he met his wife and his elder children for the last time.\n\nOn 24 April 1949 he arrived in Rome, where, through pro-Nazi Bishop [[Alois Hudal]], rector of the Teutonic College of [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]], he found rudimentary accommodation in the clerical institute \u201cVigna Pia\u201d on the southern outskirts of Rome under the name of Alfredo Reinhardt. In June he took part in an Italian film, playing the part of an actor and was in the process of collecting information about a flight to South America. As a result of his daily morning swim in the polluted [[Tiber]] he appeared [[jaundiced]] on 3 July. On 9 July, he was taken to [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Santo Spirito Hospital]] near the Vatican where W\u00e4chter revealed his true identity.
