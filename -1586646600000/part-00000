The southern and central parts of the Gobi Desert have variable plant growth due to this [[monsoon]] activity.

It extends from the [[Inner Mongolia]]n [[Plateau]] in China northward into Mongolia. It includes the [[Yin Mountains]] and many low-lying areas with salt pans and small ponds. It is bounded by the [[Mongolian-Manchurian grassland]] to the north, the Yellow River Plain to the southeast, and the Alashan Plateau semi-desert to the southeast and east.\n* '''Alashan Plateau semi-desert''', lies west and southwest of the Eastern Gobi desert steppe. It consists of the desert basins and low mountains lying between the Gobi Altai range on the north, the [[Helan Mountains]] to the southeast, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and northeastern portion of the Tibetan Plateau on the southwest.\n* '''Gobi Lakes Valley desert steppe''', ecoregion lies north of Alashan Plateau semi-desert, between the Gobi Altai range to the south and the [[Khangai Mountains]] to the north.\n* '''[[Dzungarian Basin]] semi-desert''', includes the desert basin lying between the Altai mountains on the north and the [[Tian Shan]] range on the south. It includes the northern portion of China's Xinjiang province and extends into the southeastern corner of Mongolia. The Alashan Plateau semi-desert lies to the east, and the [[Emin Valley steppe]] to the west, on the China-[[Kazakhstan]] border.\n* '''[[Tian Shan range]]''', separates the Dzungarian Basin semi-desert from the [[Taklamakan Desert]], which is a low, sandy desert basin surrounded by the high mountain ranges of the Tibetan Plateau to the south and the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]] to the west. The Taklamakan Desert ecoregion includes the [[Desert of Lop]].\n\n===Eastern Gobi desert steppe===\n{{main|Eastern Gobi desert steppe}}\n[[File:Khulan.JPG|thumb|A Khulan ([[Mongolian wild ass]]) on a hill in the eastern Gobi of [[Mongolia]] at sunset.]]\nThe surface is extremely diversified, although there are no great differences in vertical elevation. Between [[Ulaanbaatar]] ({{Coord|48|00|N|107|00|E|}}) and the small lake of Iren-dubasu-nor ({{Coord|43|45|N|111|50|E|}}), the surface is greatly eroded. Broad flat depressions and basins are separated by groups of flat-topped mountains of relatively low elevation {{convert|150|to|180|m|abbr=on}}), through which archaic rocks crop out as crags and isolated rugged masses. The floors of the depressions lie mostly between {{convert|900|to|1000|m|abbr=on}} above sea-level. Farther south, between Iren-dutiasu-nor and the [[Yellow River]], comes a region of broad tablelands alternating with flat plains, the latter ranging at altitudes of 1000\u20131100&nbsp;m and the former at {{convert|1070|to|1200|m|abbr=on}}. The slopes of the plateaus are more or less steep, and are sometimes penetrated by \"bays\" of the lowlands.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAs the border-range of the Hyangan is approached, the country steadily rises up to {{convert|1370|m|abbr=on}} and then to {{convert|1630|m|abbr=on}}. Here small lakes frequently fill the depressions, though the water in them is generally salt or brackish. Both here and for {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|mi|0}} south of Ulaanbaatar, streams are frequent and grass grows more or less abundantly. Through all the central parts, until the bordering mountains are reached, trees and shrubs are utterly absent. Clay and sand are the predominant formations; the watercourses, especially in the north, being frequently excavated {{convert|2|to|abbr=on|3|m}} deep. In many places in the flat, dry valleys or depressions farther south, beds of [[loess]], {{convert|5|to|6|m|abbr=on}} thick, are exposed. West of the route from Ulaanbaatar to [[Kalgan]], the country presents approximately the same general features, except that the mountains are not so irregularly scattered in groups but have more strongly defined strikes, mostly east to west, west-north-west to east-south-east, and west-south-west to east-north-east.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe altitudes are higher, those of the lowlands ranging from {{convert|1000|to|1700|m|abbr=on}}, and those of the ranges from {{convert|200|to|500|m|abbr=on}} higher, though in a few cases they reach altitudes of {{convert|2400|m|abbr=on}}. The elevations do not form continuous chains, but make up a congeries of short ridges and groups rising from a common base and intersected by a labyrinth of ravines, gullies, glens and basins. But the [[Plateaus|tablelands]], built up of the horizontal red deposits of the Han-gai ([[Vladimir Obruchev|Obruchev]]'s Gobi formation) which are characteristic of the southern parts of eastern Mongolia, are absent here or occur only in one locality, near the Shara-muren river. They are greatly intersected by gullies or dry watercourses. Water is scarce, with no streams, no lakes, no wells, and precipitation falls seldom. The prevailing winds blow from the west and northwest, and the pall of dust overhangs the country as in the [[Takla Makan]] and the [[desert of Lop]]. Characteristic of the flora are wild garlic, ''Kalidium gracile'', [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]], [[saxaul]], ''[[Nitraria]] schoberi'', ''[[Caragana]]'', [[Ephedra (genus)|Ephedra]], saltwort and the [[Poaceae|grass]] ''[[Lasiagrostis]] splendens''.<ref name=EB1911/> The taana wild onion ''[[Allium]] polyrrhizum'' is the main browse eaten by many herd animals, and Mongolians claim that this is essential to produce the correct, slightly hazelnut-like flavour of camel [[Kumis|airag]] (fermented milk).\n\nThis great desert country of Gobi is crossed by several trade routes, some of which have been in use for thousands of years. Among the most important are those from [[Zhangjiakou|Kalgan]] (at the Great Wall) to Ulaanbaatar ({{convert|960|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Jiuquan]] (in [[Gansu]]) to Hami {{convert|670|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}; from Hami to Beijing ({{convert|2000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Hohhot]] to Hami and Barkul; and from [[Lanzhou]] (in Gansu) to Hami.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Alashan Plateau semi-desert===\n{{main|Alashan Plateau semi-desert}}\n[[File:- panoramio - \u6469\u6e38\u4e50 (47).jpg|thumb|[[Alxa Left Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\nThe southwestern portion of the Gobi, known also as the [[Hetao|Xitao]] and the [[Little Gobi]], fills the space between the great north loop of the [[Yellow River]] on the east, the [[Ejin River]] on the west, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and narrow rocky chain of [[Longshou]], {{convert|3200|to|3500|m|abbr=on}} in altitude, on the southwest. The [[Ordos Desert]], which covers the northeastern portion of the Ordos Plateau, in the great north loop of the Yellow River, is part of this ecoregion. It belongs to the middle basin of the three great depressions into which Potanin divides the Gobi as a whole.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n\"Topographically,\" says [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], \"it is a perfectly level plain, which in all probability once formed the bed of a huge lake or inland sea.\" He concludes this based on the level area of the region as a whole, the hard saldgine clay and the sand-strewn surface and, lastly, the salt lakes which occupy its lowest parts. For hundreds of kilometers, nothing can be seen but bare sands; in some places they continue so far without a break that the Mongols call them ''Tengger'' (i.e. sky). These vast expanses are absolutely waterless, nor do any oases relieve the unbroken stretches of yellow sand, which alternate with equally vast areas of saline clay or, nearer the foot of the mountains, with barren shingle. Although on the whole a level country with a general altitude of {{convert|1000|to|1500|m|abbr=on}}, this section, like most other parts of the Gobi, is crowned by a chequered network of hills and broken ranges going up 300&nbsp;m higher. The vegetation is confined to a few varieties of bushes and a dozen kinds of grasses and herbs, the most conspicuous being saxaul (''[[Haloxylon ammondendron]]'') and ''[[Agriophyllum gobicum]]''. The others include prickly [[convolvulus]], field wormwood (''[[Artemisia campestris]]''), [[acacia]], ''[[Inula ammophila]]'', ''[[Sophora flavescens]]'', ''[[Convolvulus ammanii]]'', ''[[Peganum]]'' and ''[[Astragalus]]'' species, but all dwarfed, deformed and starved. The fauna consists of little but antelope, wolf, fox, hare, hedgehog, marten, numerous lizards and a few birds, e.g. the sandgrouse, lark, stonechat, sparrow, crane, [[Henderson's ground jay]] (''[[Podoces hendersoni]]''), [[horned lark]] (''[[Eremophila alpestris]]''), and [[crested lark]] (''[[Galerida cristata]]'').<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Dzungarian Basin semi-desert===\n{{quote|The structure here is that of the mighty [[Tian Shan|T'ien Shan]], or Heavenly Mountains, running from west to east. It divides the northern one-third of Sinkiang from the southern two-thirds. On the northern side, rivers formed from the snow and glaciers of the high mountains break through barren foothill ranges and flow out into an immense, hollow plain. Here the rivers begin to straggle and fan out, and form great marshes with dense reed-beds. Westerners call this terrain the Dzungarian desert. The Chinese also call it a desert, but the Mongols call it a 'gobi'\u2014that is, a land of thin herbage, more suitable for camels than for cows, but capable also, if herds are kept small and moved frequently, of sustaining horses, sheep, and goats. The herbage comprises a high proportion of woody, fragrant plants. Gobi mutton is the most aromatic in the world.<ref>Lattimore (1973), p. 238.</ref>}}\n\nThe Yulduz valley or valley of the Haidag-gol ({{Coord|43|N|83|E |region:CN-65}}\u2013{{Coord|43|N|86|E |region:CN-65}}) is a mini desert enclosed by two prominent members of the Shanashen Trahen Osh mountain range, namely the chucis and the kracenard pine rallies, running perpendicular and far from one another. As they proceed south, they transcend and transpose, sweeping back on east and west respectively, with [[Lake Bosten]] in between. These two ranges mark the northern and the southern edges respectively of a great swelling, which extends eastward for nearly twenty degrees of longitude. On its northern side, the Chol-tagh descends steeply, and its foot is fringed by a string of deep depressions, ranging from [[Lukchun]] ({{convert|130|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level) to [[Hami City|Hami]] ({{convert|850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea-level). To the south of the Kuruk-tagh lie the desert of [[Lop Nur]], the [[Kum-tagh]] desert, and the valley of the [[Bulunzir-gol]]. To this great swelling, which arches up between the two border-ranges of the Chol-tagh and Kuruk-tagh, the [[Mongols]] give the name of ''[[Ghashuun-Gobi]]'' or \"Salt Desert\". It is some {{convert|130|to|160|km|abbr=on}} across from north to south, and is traversed by a number of minor parallel ranges, ridges and chains of hills. Down its middle runs a broad stony valley, {{convert|40|to|80|km|abbr=on}} wide, at an elevation of {{convert|900|to|1370|m|abbr=on}}. The Chol-tagh, which reaches an average altitude of {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, is absolutely sterile, and its northern foot rests upon a narrow belt of barren sand, which leads down to the depressions mentioned above.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe Kuruk-tagh is the greatly disintegrated, denuded and wasted relic of a mountain range which used to be of incomparably greater magnitude. In the west, between Lake Bosten and the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], it consists of two, possibly of three, principal ranges, which, although broken in continuity, run generally parallel to one another, and embrace between them numerous minor chains of heights. These minor ranges, together with the principal ranges, divide the region into a series of long; narrow valleys, mostly parallel to one another and to the enclosing mountain chains, which descend like terraced steps, on the one side towards the depression of Lukchun and on the other towards the desert of Lop.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn many cases these latitudinal valleys are barred transversely by ridges or spurs, generally elevations en masse of the bottom of the valley. Where such elevations exist, there is generally found, on the east side of the transverse ridge, a cauldron-shaped depression, which some time or other has been the bottom of a former lake, but is now nearly a dry salt-basin. The surface configuration is in fact markedly similar to that which occurs in the inter-mount latitudinal valleys of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. The [[hydrography]] of the Ghashiun-Gobi and the Kuruk-tagh is determined by these chequered arrangements of the latitudinal valleys. Most of the principal streams, instead of flowing straight down these valleys, cross them diagonally and only turn west after they have cut their way through one or more of the transverse barrier ranges.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nTo the highest range on the great swelling [[Grigory Grum-Grshimailo]] gives the name of [[Tuge-tau]], its altitude being {{convert|2700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the level of the sea and some {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the crown of the swelling itself. This range he considers to belong to the [[Choltagh]] system, whereas [[Sven Hedin]] would assign it to the Kuruk-tagh. This last, which is pretty certainly identical with the range of [[Kharateken-ula]] (also known as the [[Kyzyl-sanghir]], [[Sinir]], and [[Singher Mountains]]), that overlooks the southern shore of the Lake Bosten, though parted from it by the drift-sand desert of [[Ak-bel-kum]] (White Pass Sands), has at first a west-northwest to east-southeast strike, but it gradually curves round like a scimitar towards the east-northeast and at the same time gradually decreases in elevation.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 91\u00b0 east, while the principal range of the Kuruk-tagh system wheels to the east-northeast, four of its subsidiary ranges terminate, or rather die away somewhat suddenly, on the brink of a long narrow depression (in which Sven Hedin sees a northeast bay of the former great Central Asian lake of Lop-nor), having over against them the \u00e9cheloned terminals of similar subordinate ranges of the [[Pe-shan]] (Boy-san) system (see below). The Kuruk-tagh is throughout a relatively low, but almost completely barren range, being entirely destitute of animal life, save for hares, antelopes and wild camels, which frequent its few small, widely scattered oases. The vegetation, which is confined to these same relatively favoured spots, is of the scantiest and is mainly confined to bushes of [[Haloxylon ammodendron|saxaul]] ''(Haloxylon)'', ''[[Anabasis (plant)|anabasis]]'', reeds (kamish), [[tamarisk]]s, [[Populus|poplars]], and [[Ephedra]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==European exploration==\nThe Gobi had a long history of human habitation, mostly by nomadic peoples. By the early 20th century, the region was under the nominal control of Manchu-China, and inhabited mostly by [[Mongol]]s, [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and [[Kazakhs]]. The Gobi Desert as a whole was known only very imperfectly to outsiders, and information was confined to observations by individual travellers from their respective itineraries across the desert.

It extends from the [[Inner Mongolia]]n [[Plateau]] in China northward into Mongolia. It includes the [[Yin Mountains]] and many low-lying areas with salt pans and small ponds. It is bounded by the [[Mongolian-Manchurian grassland]] to the north, the Yellow River Plain to the southeast, and the Alashan Plateau semi-desert to the southeast and east.\n* '''Alashan Plateau semi-desert''', lies west and southwest of the Eastern Gobi desert steppe. It consists of the desert basins and low mountains lying between the Gobi Altai range on the north, the [[Helan Mountains]] to the southeast, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and northeastern portion of the Tibetan Plateau on the southwest.\n* '''Gobi Lakes Valley desert steppe''', ecoregion lies north of Alashan Plateau semi-desert, between the Gobi Altai range to the south and the [[Khangai Mountains]] to the north.\n* '''[[Dzungarian Basin]] semi-desert''', includes the desert basin lying between the Altai mountains on the north and the [[Tian Shan]] range on the south. It includes the northern portion of China's Xinjiang province and extends into the southeastern corner of Mongolia. The Alashan Plateau semi-desert lies to the east, and the [[Emin Valley steppe]] to the west, on the China-[[Kazakhstan]] border.\n* '''[[Tian Shan range]]''', separates the Dzungarian Basin semi-desert from the [[Taklamakan Desert]], which is a low, sandy desert basin surrounded by the high mountain ranges of the Tibetan Plateau to the south and the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]] to the west. The Taklamakan Desert ecoregion includes the [[Desert of Lop]].\n\n===Eastern Gobi desert steppe===\n{{main|Eastern Gobi desert steppe}}\n[[File:Khulan.JPG|thumb|A Khulan ([[Mongolian wild ass]]) on a hill in the eastern Gobi of [[Mongolia]] at sunset.]]\nThe surface is extremely diversified, although there are no great differences in vertical elevation. Between [[Ulaanbaatar]] ({{Coord|48|00|N|107|00|E|}}) and the small lake of Iren-dubasu-nor ({{Coord|43|45|N|111|50|E|}}), the surface is greatly eroded. Broad flat depressions and basins are separated by groups of flat-topped mountains of relatively low elevation {{convert|150|to|180|m|abbr=on}}), through which archaic rocks crop out as crags and isolated rugged masses. The floors of the depressions lie mostly between {{convert|900|to|1000|m|abbr=on}} above sea-level. Farther south, between Iren-dutiasu-nor and the [[Yellow River]], comes a region of broad tablelands alternating with flat plains, the latter ranging at altitudes of 1000\u20131100&nbsp;m and the former at {{convert|1070|to|1200|m|abbr=on}}. The slopes of the plateaus are more or less steep, and are sometimes penetrated by \"bays\" of the lowlands.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAs the border-range of the Hyangan is approached, the country steadily rises up to {{convert|1370|m|abbr=on}} and then to {{convert|1630|m|abbr=on}}. Here small lakes frequently fill the depressions, though the water in them is generally salt or brackish. Both here and for {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|mi|0}} south of Ulaanbaatar, streams are frequent and grass grows more or less abundantly. Through all the central parts, until the bordering mountains are reached, trees and shrubs are utterly absent. Clay and sand are the predominant formations; the watercourses, especially in the north, being frequently excavated {{convert|2|to|abbr=on|3|m}} deep. In many places in the flat, dry valleys or depressions farther south, beds of [[loess]], {{convert|5|to|6|m|abbr=on}} thick, are exposed. West of the route from Ulaanbaatar to [[Kalgan]], the country presents approximately the same general features, except that the mountains are not so irregularly scattered in groups but have more strongly defined strikes, mostly east to west, west-north-west to east-south-east, and west-south-west to east-north-east.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe altitudes are higher, those of the lowlands ranging from {{convert|1000|to|1700|m|abbr=on}}, and those of the ranges from {{convert|200|to|500|m|abbr=on}} higher, though in a few cases they reach altitudes of {{convert|2400|m|abbr=on}}. The elevations do not form continuous chains, but make up a congeries of short ridges and groups rising from a common base and intersected by a labyrinth of ravines, gullies, glens and basins. But the [[Plateaus|tablelands]], built up of the horizontal red deposits of the Han-gai ([[Vladimir Obruchev|Obruchev]]'s Gobi formation) which are characteristic of the southern parts of eastern Mongolia, are absent here or occur only in one locality, near the Shara-muren river. They are greatly intersected by gullies or dry watercourses. Water is scarce, with no streams, no lakes, no wells, and precipitation falls seldom. The prevailing winds blow from the west and northwest, and the pall of dust overhangs the country as in the [[Takla Makan]] and the [[desert of Lop]]. Characteristic of the flora are wild garlic, ''Kalidium gracile'', [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]], [[saxaul]], ''[[Nitraria]] schoberi'', ''[[Caragana]]'', [[Ephedra (genus)|Ephedra]], saltwort and the [[Poaceae|grass]] ''[[Lasiagrostis]] splendens''.<ref name=EB1911/> The taana wild onion ''[[Allium]] polyrrhizum'' is the main browse eaten by many herd animals, and Mongolians claim that this is essential to produce the correct, slightly hazelnut-like flavour of camel [[Kumis|airag]] (fermented milk).\n\nThis great desert country of Gobi is crossed by several trade routes, some of which have been in use for thousands of years. Among the most important are those from [[Zhangjiakou|Kalgan]] (at the Great Wall) to Ulaanbaatar ({{convert|960|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Jiuquan]] (in [[Gansu]]) to Hami {{convert|670|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}; from Hami to Beijing ({{convert|2000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}); from [[Hohhot]] to Hami and Barkul; and from [[Lanzhou]] (in Gansu) to Hami.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Alashan Plateau semi-desert===\n{{main|Alashan Plateau semi-desert}}\n[[File:- panoramio - \u6469\u6e38\u4e50 (47).jpg|thumb|[[Alxa Left Banner]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China]]\nThe southwestern portion of the Gobi, known also as the [[Hetao|Xitao]] and the [[Little Gobi]], fills the space between the great north loop of the [[Yellow River]] on the east, the [[Ejin River]] on the west, and the [[Qilian Mountains]] and narrow rocky chain of [[Longshou]], {{convert|3200|to|3500|m|abbr=on}} in altitude, on the southwest. The [[Ordos Desert]], which covers the northeastern portion of the Ordos Plateau, in the great north loop of the Yellow River, is part of this ecoregion. It belongs to the middle basin of the three great depressions into which Potanin divides the Gobi as a whole.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n\"Topographically,\" says [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], \"it is a perfectly level plain, which in all probability once formed the bed of a huge lake or inland sea.\" He concludes this based on the level area of the region as a whole, the hard saldgine clay and the sand-strewn surface and, lastly, the salt lakes which occupy its lowest parts. For hundreds of kilometers, nothing can be seen but bare sands; in some places they continue so far without a break that the Mongols call them ''Tengger'' (i.e. sky). These vast expanses are absolutely waterless, nor do any oases relieve the unbroken stretches of yellow sand, which alternate with equally vast areas of saline clay or, nearer the foot of the mountains, with barren shingle. Although on the whole a level country with a general altitude of {{convert|1000|to|1500|m|abbr=on}}, this section, like most other parts of the Gobi, is crowned by a chequered network of hills and broken ranges going up 300&nbsp;m higher. The vegetation is confined to a few varieties of bushes and a dozen kinds of grasses and herbs, the most conspicuous being saxaul (''[[Haloxylon ammondendron]]'') and ''[[Agriophyllum gobicum]]''. The others include prickly [[convolvulus]], field wormwood (''[[Artemisia campestris]]''), [[acacia]], ''[[Inula ammophila]]'', ''[[Sophora flavescens]]'', ''[[Convolvulus ammanii]]'', ''[[Peganum]]'' and ''[[Astragalus]]'' species, but all dwarfed, deformed and starved. The fauna consists of little but antelope, wolf, fox, hare, hedgehog, marten, numerous lizards and a few birds, e.g. the sandgrouse, lark, stonechat, sparrow, crane, [[Henderson's ground jay]] (''[[Podoces hendersoni]]''), [[horned lark]] (''[[Eremophila alpestris]]''), and [[crested lark]] (''[[Galerida cristata]]'').<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Dzungarian Basin semi-desert===\n{{quote|The structure here is that of the mighty [[Tian Shan|T'ien Shan]], or Heavenly Mountains, running from west to east. It divides the northern one-third of Sinkiang from the southern two-thirds. On the northern side, rivers formed from the snow and glaciers of the high mountains break through barren foothill ranges and flow out into an immense, hollow plain. Here the rivers begin to straggle and fan out, and form great marshes with dense reed-beds. Westerners call this terrain the Dzungarian desert. The Chinese also call it a desert, but the Mongols call it a 'gobi'\u2014that is, a land of thin herbage, more suitable for camels than for cows, but capable also, if herds are kept small and moved frequently, of sustaining horses, sheep, and goats. The herbage comprises a high proportion of woody, fragrant plants. Gobi mutton is the most aromatic in the world.<ref>Lattimore (1973), p. 238.</ref>}}\n\nThe Yulduz valley or valley of the Haidag-gol ({{Coord|43|N|83|E |region:CN-65}}\u2013{{Coord|43|N|86|E |region:CN-65}}) is a mini desert enclosed by two prominent members of the Shanashen Trahen Osh mountain range, namely the chucis and the kracenard pine rallies, running perpendicular and far from one another. As they proceed south, they transcend and transpose, sweeping back on east and west respectively, with [[Lake Bosten]] in between. These two ranges mark the northern and the southern edges respectively of a great swelling, which extends eastward for nearly twenty degrees of longitude. On its northern side, the Chol-tagh descends steeply, and its foot is fringed by a string of deep depressions, ranging from [[Lukchun]] ({{convert|130|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level) to [[Hami City|Hami]] ({{convert|850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea-level). To the south of the Kuruk-tagh lie the desert of [[Lop Nur]], the [[Kum-tagh]] desert, and the valley of the [[Bulunzir-gol]]. To this great swelling, which arches up between the two border-ranges of the Chol-tagh and Kuruk-tagh, the [[Mongols]] give the name of ''[[Ghashuun-Gobi]]'' or \"Salt Desert\". It is some {{convert|130|to|160|km|abbr=on}} across from north to south, and is traversed by a number of minor parallel ranges, ridges and chains of hills. Down its middle runs a broad stony valley, {{convert|40|to|80|km|abbr=on}} wide, at an elevation of {{convert|900|to|1370|m|abbr=on}}. The Chol-tagh, which reaches an average altitude of {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, is absolutely sterile, and its northern foot rests upon a narrow belt of barren sand, which leads down to the depressions mentioned above.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe Kuruk-tagh is the greatly disintegrated, denuded and wasted relic of a mountain range which used to be of incomparably greater magnitude. In the west, between Lake Bosten and the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], it consists of two, possibly of three, principal ranges, which, although broken in continuity, run generally parallel to one another, and embrace between them numerous minor chains of heights. These minor ranges, together with the principal ranges, divide the region into a series of long; narrow valleys, mostly parallel to one another and to the enclosing mountain chains, which descend like terraced steps, on the one side towards the depression of Lukchun and on the other towards the desert of Lop.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn many cases these latitudinal valleys are barred transversely by ridges or spurs, generally elevations en masse of the bottom of the valley. Where such elevations exist, there is generally found, on the east side of the transverse ridge, a cauldron-shaped depression, which some time or other has been the bottom of a former lake, but is now nearly a dry salt-basin. The surface configuration is in fact markedly similar to that which occurs in the inter-mount latitudinal valleys of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. The [[hydrography]] of the Ghashiun-Gobi and the Kuruk-tagh is determined by these chequered arrangements of the latitudinal valleys. Most of the principal streams, instead of flowing straight down these valleys, cross them diagonally and only turn west after they have cut their way through one or more of the transverse barrier ranges.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nTo the highest range on the great swelling [[Grigory Grum-Grshimailo]] gives the name of [[Tuge-tau]], its altitude being {{convert|2700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the level of the sea and some {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the crown of the swelling itself. This range he considers to belong to the [[Choltagh]] system, whereas [[Sven Hedin]] would assign it to the Kuruk-tagh. This last, which is pretty certainly identical with the range of [[Kharateken-ula]] (also known as the [[Kyzyl-sanghir]], [[Sinir]], and [[Singher Mountains]]), that overlooks the southern shore of the Lake Bosten, though parted from it by the drift-sand desert of [[Ak-bel-kum]] (White Pass Sands), has at first a west-northwest to east-southeast strike, but it gradually curves round like a scimitar towards the east-northeast and at the same time gradually decreases in elevation.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 91\u00b0 east, while the principal range of the Kuruk-tagh system wheels to the east-northeast, four of its subsidiary ranges terminate, or rather die away somewhat suddenly, on the brink of a long narrow depression (in which Sven Hedin sees a northeast bay of the former great Central Asian lake of Lop-nor), having over against them the \u00e9cheloned terminals of similar subordinate ranges of the [[Pe-shan]] (Boy-san) system (see below). The Kuruk-tagh is throughout a relatively low, but almost completely barren range, being entirely destitute of animal life, save for hares, antelopes and wild camels, which frequent its few small, widely scattered oases. The vegetation, which is confined to these same relatively favoured spots, is of the scantiest and is mainly confined to bushes of [[Haloxylon ammodendron|saxaul]] ''(Haloxylon)'', ''[[Anabasis (plant)|anabasis]]'', reeds (kamish), [[tamarisk]]s, [[Populus|poplars]], and [[Ephedra]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==European exploration==\nThe Gobi had a long history of human habitation, mostly by nomadic peoples. By the early 20th century, the region was under the nominal control of Manchu-China, and inhabited mostly by [[Mongol]]s, [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], and [[Kazakhs]]. The Gobi Desert as a whole was known only very imperfectly to outsiders, and information was confined to observations by individual travellers from their respective itineraries across the desert.

It is a variable that summarizes positive [[correlation]]s among different cognitive tasks, reflecting the fact that an individual's performance on one type of cognitive task tends to be comparable to that person's performance on other kinds of cognitive tasks. The ''g'' factor typically accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the between-individual performance differences on a given [[cognitive test]], and composite scores (\"IQ scores\") based on many tests are frequently regarded as estimates of individuals' standing on the ''g'' factor.<ref name=\"kamphaus2005\">Kamphaus et al. 2005</ref> The terms ''IQ, general intelligence, general cognitive ability, general mental ability'', and simply ''intelligence'' are often used interchangeably to refer to this common core shared by cognitive tests.<ref name=\"deary2010\">Deary et al. 2010</ref> The ''g'' factor targets a particular measure of  ''general intelligence''.\n\nFor broader coverage of IQ metrics, see [[Intelligence quotient]].\n\nThe existence of the ''g'' factor was originally proposed by the English psychologist [[Charles Spearman]] in the early years of the 20th century. He observed that children's performance ratings, across seemingly unrelated school subjects, were positively [[correlated]], and reasoned that these correlations reflected the influence of an underlying general mental ability that entered into performance on all kinds of mental tests. Spearman suggested that all mental performance could be conceptualized in terms of a single general ability factor, which he labeled ''g'', and many narrow task-specific ability factors. Soon after Spearman proposed the existence of ''g'', it was challenged by [[Godfrey Thomson]], who presented evidence that such intercorrelations among test results could arise even if no ''g''-factor existed.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=THOMSON |first=GODFREY H. |date=September 1916|journal=British Journal of Psychology |language=en |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=271\u2013281 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1916.tb00133.x |issn=0950-5652|title=A Hierarchy Without a General Factor1 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1447717 }}</ref> Today's factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three-level hierarchy, where there are many narrow [[Factor analysis|factors]] at the bottom of the hierarchy, a handful of broad, more general factors at the intermediate level, and at the apex a single factor, referred to as the ''g'' factor, which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks.\n\nTraditionally, research on ''g'' has concentrated on psychometric investigations of test data, with a special emphasis on [[factor analysis|factor analytic]] approaches. However, empirical research on the nature of ''g'' has also drawn upon experimental [[cognitive psychology]] and [[mental chronometry]], brain anatomy and physiology, [[quantitative genetics|quantitative]] and [[molecular genetics]], and [[Evolution of human intelligence|primate evolution]].<ref>Jensen 1998, 545</ref> Some scientists consider ''g'' as a statistical regularity and uncontroversial, and a general cognitive factor appears in data collected from people in nearly every human culture.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Warne|first=Russell T.|last2=Burningham|first2=Cassidy|date=2019|title=Spearman's g found in 31 non-Western nations: Strong evidence that g is a universal phenomenon|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=145|issue=3|pages=237\u2013272|doi=10.1037/bul0000184|pmid=30640496|url=http://psyarxiv.com/uv673/}}</ref> Yet, there is no consensus as to what causes the positive correlations between tests.\n\nResearch in the field of [[behavioral genetics]] has established that the construct of ''g'' is highly [[Heritability of IQ|heritable]].

Specific domains assessed by tests include mathematical skill, verbal fluency, spatial visualization, and memory, among others. However, individuals who excel at one type of test tend to excel at other kinds of tests, too, while those who do poorly on one test tend to do so on all tests, regardless of the tests' contents.<ref>Gottfredson 1998</ref> The English psychologist Charles Spearman was the first to describe this phenomenon.<ref>Deary 2001, 12</ref> In a famous research paper published in 1904,<ref>Spearman 1904</ref> he observed that children's performance measures across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated. This finding has since been replicated numerous times. The consistent finding of universally positive [[correlation matrix|correlation matrices]] of mental test results (or the \"positive manifold\"), despite large differences in tests' contents, has been described as \"arguably the most replicated result in all psychology\".<ref>Deary 2000, 6</ref> Zero or negative correlations between tests suggest the presence of [[sampling error]] or restriction of the range of ability in the sample studied.<ref name=\"jensen1992\">Jensen 1992</ref>\n\nUsing [[factor analysis]] or related statistical methods, it is possible to compute a single common factor that can be regarded as a summary variable characterizing the correlations between all the different tests in a test battery. Spearman referred to this common factor as the ''general factor'', or simply ''g''. (By convention, ''g'' is always printed as a lower case italic.) Mathematically, the ''g'' factor is ''a source of variance among individuals'', which entails that one cannot meaningfully speak of any one individual's mental abilities consisting of ''g'' or other factors to any specified degrees. One can only speak of an individual's standing on ''g'' (or other factors) compared to other individuals in a relevant population.<ref name=\"jensen1992\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 28</ref><ref name=\"maas\">van deer Maas et al. 2006</ref>\n\nDifferent tests in a test battery may correlate with (or \"load onto\") the ''g'' factor of the battery to different degrees. These correlations are known as ''g'' loadings. An individual test taker's ''g'' factor score, representing his or her relative standing on the ''g'' factor in the total group of individuals, can be estimated using the ''g'' loadings. Full-scale IQ scores from a test battery will usually be highly correlated with ''g'' factor scores, and they are often regarded as estimates of ''g''. For example, the correlations between ''g'' factor scores and full-scale IQ scores from [[David Wechsler]]'s tests have been found to be greater than .95.<ref name=\"kamphaus2005\"/><ref name=\"jensen1992\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 26, 36\u201339</ref> The terms IQ, general intelligence, general cognitive ability, general mental ability, or simply intelligence are frequently used interchangeably to refer to the common core shared by cognitive tests.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nThe ''g'' loadings of mental tests are always positive and usually range between .10 and .90, with a mean of about .60 and a standard deviation of about .15. [[Raven's Progressive Matrices]] is among the tests with the highest ''g'' loadings, around .80. Tests of vocabulary and general information are also typically found to have high ''g'' loadings.<ref>Jensen 1998, 26, 36\u201339, 89\u201390</ref><ref name=\"Jensen 2002\">Jensen 2002</ref> However, the ''g'' loading of the same test may vary somewhat depending on the composition of the test battery.<ref name=\"floyd2009\">Floyd et al. 2009</ref>\n\nThe complexity of tests and the demands they place on mental manipulation are related to the tests' ''g'' loadings. For example, in the forward digit span test the subject is asked to repeat a sequence of digits in the order of their presentation after hearing them once at a rate of one digit per second. The backward digit span test is otherwise the same except that the subject is asked to repeat the digits in the reverse order to that in which they were presented. The backward digit span test is more complex than the forward digit span test, and it has a significantly higher ''g'' loading. Similarly, the ''g'' loadings of arithmetic computation, spelling, and word reading tests are lower than those of arithmetic problem solving, text composition, and reading comprehension tests, respectively.<ref name=\"jensen1992\"/><ref name=\"Jensen 1980, 213\">Jensen 1980, 213</ref>\n\nTest difficulty and ''g'' loadings are distinct concepts that may or may not be empirically related in any specific situation. Tests that have the same difficulty level, as indexed by the proportion of test items that are failed by test takers, may exhibit a wide range of ''g'' loadings. For example, tests of [[rote memory]] have been shown to have the same level of difficulty but considerably lower ''g'' loadings than many tests that involve reasoning.<ref name=\"Jensen 1980, 213\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 94</ref>\n\n==Theories==\n\nWhile the existence of ''g'' as a statistical regularity is well-established and uncontroversial among experts, there is no consensus as to what causes the positive intercorrelations. Several explanations have been proposed.<ref name=\"Hunt 2011, 94\">Hunt 2011, 94</ref>\n\n===Mental energy or efficiency===\n\nCharles Spearman reasoned that correlations between tests reflected the influence of a common causal factor, a general mental ability that enters into performance on all kinds of mental tasks. However, he thought that the best indicators of ''g'' were those tests that reflected what he called ''the eduction of relations and correlates'', which included abilities such as [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], problem solving, grasping relationships, inferring rules, and spotting differences and similarities. Spearman hypothesized that ''g'' was equivalent with \"mental energy\". However, this was more of a metaphorical explanation, and he remained agnostic about the physical basis of this energy, expecting that future research would uncover the exact physiological nature of ''g''.<ref>Jensen 1998, 18\u201319, 35\u201336, 38. The idea of a general, unitary mental ability was introduced to psychology by [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Francis Galton]] in the latter half of the 19th century, but their work was largely speculative, with little empirical basis.</ref>\n\nFollowing Spearman, [[Arthur Jensen]] maintained that all mental tasks tap into ''g'' to some degree. According to Jensen, the ''g'' factor represents a \"distillate\" of scores on different tests rather than a summation or an average of such scores, with factor analysis acting as the [[distillation]] procedure.<ref name=\"Jensen 2002\"/> He argued that ''g'' cannot be described in terms of the item characteristics or information content of tests, pointing out that very dissimilar mental tasks may have nearly equal ''g'' loadings.  Wechsler similarly contended that ''g'' is not an ability at all but rather some general property of the brain. Jensen hypothesized that ''g'' corresponds to individual differences in the speed or efficiency of the neural processes associated with mental abilities.<ref>Jensen 1998, 91\u201392, 95</ref> He also suggested that given the associations between ''g'' and [[#Elementary cognitive tasks|elementary cognitive tasks]], it should be possible to construct a [[ratio scale]] test of ''g'' that uses [[time]] as the unit of measurement.<ref>Jensen 2000</ref>\n\n===Sampling theory===\n\nThe so-called sampling theory of ''g'', originally developed by [[E.L. Thorndike]] and [[Godfrey Thomson]], proposes that the existence of the positive manifold can be explained without reference to a unitary underlying capacity. According to this theory, there are a number of uncorrelated mental processes, and all tests draw upon different samples of these processes. The intercorrelations between tests are caused by an overlap between processes tapped by the tests.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 157</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 117</ref> Thus, the positive manifold arises due to a measurement problem, an inability to measure more fine-grained, presumably uncorrelated mental processes.<ref name=\"maas\"/>\n\nIt has been shown that it is not possible to distinguish statistically between Spearman's model of ''g'' and the sampling model; both are equally able to account for intercorrelations among tests.<ref>Bartholomew et al. 2009</ref> The sampling theory is also consistent with the observation that more complex mental tasks have higher ''g'' loadings, because more complex tasks are expected to involve a larger sampling of neural elements and therefore have more of them in common with other tasks.<ref>Jensen 1998, 120</ref>\n\nSome researchers have argued that the sampling model invalidates ''g'' as a psychological concept, because the model suggests that ''g'' factors derived from different test batteries simply reflect the shared elements of the particular tests contained in each battery rather than a ''g'' that is common to all tests. Similarly, high correlations between different batteries could be due to them measuring the same set of abilities rather than ''the'' same ability.<ref name=\"horn&mcardle\"/>\n\nCritics have argued that the sampling theory is incongruent with certain empirical findings. Based on the sampling theory, one might expect that related cognitive tests share many elements and thus be highly correlated. However, some closely related tests, such as forward and backward digit span, are only modestly correlated, while some seemingly completely dissimilar tests, such as vocabulary tests and Raven's matrices, are consistently highly correlated. Another problematic finding is that brain damage frequently leads to specific cognitive impairments rather than a general impairment one might expect based on the sampling theory.<ref name=\"maas\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 120\u2013121</ref>\n\n===Mutualism===\n\nThe \"mutualism\" model of ''g'' proposes that cognitive processes are initially uncorrelated, but that the positive manifold arises during individual development due to mutual beneficial relations between cognitive processes. Thus there is no single process or capacity underlying the positive correlations between tests. During the course of development, the theory holds, any one particularly efficient process will benefit other processes, with the result that the processes will end up being correlated with one another. Thus similarly high IQs in different persons may stem from quite different initial advantages that they had.<ref name=\"maas\"/><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 157\u2013158</ref> Critics have argued that the observed correlations between the ''g'' loadings and the heritability coefficients of subtests are problematic for the mutualism theory.<ref name=RJ2010/>\n\n===Social exchange and sexual selection===\n{{multiple image\n |align    = right\n |width    = 175\n |direction= vertical\n |image1   = Wason selection task cards.svg\n |caption1 = Each card has a number on one side, and a patch of color on the other.

Each small oval is a hypothetical mental test. The blue areas correspond to test-specific variance (''s''), while the purple areas represent the variance attributed to ''g''.]]\n\n[[Factor analysis]] is a family of mathematical techniques that can be used to represent correlations between intelligence tests in terms of a smaller number of variables known as factors. The purpose is to simplify the correlation matrix by using hypothetical underlying factors to explain the patterns in it. When all correlations in a matrix are positive, as they are in the case of IQ, factor analysis will yield a general factor common to all tests. The general factor of IQ tests is referred to as the ''g'' factor, and it typically accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the variance in IQ test batteries.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 44\u201345</ref> The presence of correlations between many widely varying cognitive tests has often been taken as evidence for the existence of ''g'', but McFarland (2012) showed that such correlations do not provide any more or less support for the existence of ''g'' than for the existence of multiple factors of intelligence.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McFarland |first=Dennis J. |date=2012 |title=A single g factor is not necessary to simulate positive correlations between cognitive tests |journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=378\u2013384 |doi=10.1080/13803395.2011.645018 |issn=1744-411X |pmid=22260190|quote=The fact that diverse cognitive tests tend to be positively correlated has been taken as evidence for a single general ability or \"g\" factor...the presence of a positive manifold in the correlations between diverse cognitive tests does not provide differential support for either single factor or multiple factor models of general abilities.|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b85fe663593c1272f614005da0868967077a754f }}</ref>\n\nCharles Spearman developed factor analysis in order to study correlations between tests. Initially, he developed a model of intelligence in which variations in all intelligence test scores are explained by only two kinds of variables: first, factors that are specific to each test (denoted ''s''); and second, a ''g'' factor that accounts for the positive correlations across tests. This is known as Spearman's two-factor theory. Later research based on more diverse test batteries than those used by Spearman demonstrated that ''g'' alone could not account for all correlations between tests. Specifically, it was found that even after controlling for ''g'', some tests were still correlated with each other. This led to the postulation of ''group factors'' that represent variance that groups of tests with similar task demands (e.g., verbal, spatial, or numerical) have in common in addition to the shared ''g'' variance.<ref>Jensen 1998, 18, 31\u201332</ref>\n\n[[Image:Carroll three stratum model of human Intelligence.png|right|thumb|500px|An illustration of [[John B. Carroll]]'s [[three stratum theory]], an influential contemporary model of cognitive abilities. The broad abilities recognized by the model are fluid intelligence (Gf), crystallized intelligence (Gc), general memory and learning (Gy), broad visual perception (Gv), broad auditory perception (Gu), broad retrieval ability (Gr), broad cognitive speediness (Gs), and processing speed (Gt). Carroll regarded the broad abilities as different \"flavors\" of ''g''.]]\n\nThrough [[Factor analysis#Rotation methods|factor rotation]], it is, in principle, possible to produce an infinite number of different factor solutions that are mathematically equivalent in their ability to account for the intercorrelations among cognitive tests. These include solutions that do not contain a ''g'' factor. Thus factor analysis alone cannot establish what the underlying structure of intelligence is. In choosing between different factor solutions, researchers have to examine the results of factor analysis together with other information about the structure of cognitive abilities.<ref name=\"carroll1995\">Carroll 1995</ref>\n\nThere are many psychologically relevant reasons for preferring factor solutions that contain a ''g'' factor. These include the existence of the positive manifold, the fact that certain kinds of tests (generally the more complex ones) have consistently larger ''g'' loadings, the substantial invariance of ''g'' factors across different test batteries, the impossibility of constructing test batteries that do not yield a ''g'' factor, and the widespread practical validity of ''g'' as a predictor of individual outcomes. The ''g'' factor, together with group factors, best represents the empirically established fact that, on average, overall ability differences ''between'' individuals are greater than differences among abilities ''within'' individuals, while a factor solution with orthogonal factors without ''g'' obscures this fact. Moreover, ''g'' appears to be the most heritable component of intelligence.<ref name=\"jensen1982\">Jensen 1982</ref> Research utilizing the techniques of [[confirmatory factor analysis]] has also provided support for the existence of ''g''.<ref name=\"carroll1995\"/>\n\nA ''g'' factor can be computed from a correlation matrix of test results using several different methods. These include exploratory factor analysis, [[principal components analysis]] (PCA), and confirmatory factor analysis. Different factor-extraction methods produce highly consistent results, although PCA has sometimes been found to produce inflated estimates of the influence of ''g'' on test scores.<ref name=\"floyd2009\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 73</ref>\n\nThere is a broad contemporary consensus that cognitive variance between people can be conceptualized at three hierarchical levels, distinguished by their degree of generality. At the lowest, least general level there are many narrow first-order factors; at a higher level, there are a relatively small number \u2013 somewhere between five and ten \u2013 of broad (i.e., more general) second-order factors (or group factors); and at the apex, there is a single third-order factor, ''g'', the general factor common to all tests.<ref name=\"deary2012\">Deary 2012</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 57</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 46</ref> The ''g'' factor usually accounts for the majority of the total common factor variance of IQ test batteries.<ref>Carroll 1997. The total common factor variance consists of the variance due to the ''g'' factor and the group factors considered together. The variance not accounted for by the common factors, referred to as ''uniqueness'', comprises subtest-specific variance and measurement error.</ref> Contemporary hierarchical models of intelligence include the [[three stratum theory]] and the [[Cattell\u2013Horn\u2013Carroll theory]].<ref name=\"d&k\">Davidson & Kemp 2011</ref>\n\n==\"Indifference of the indicator\"==\n\nSpearman proposed the principle of the ''indifference of the indicator'', according to which the precise content of intelligence tests is unimportant for the purposes of identifying ''g'', because ''g'' enters into performance on all kinds of tests. Any test can therefore be used as an indicator of ''g''.<ref name=\":2\" /> Following Spearman, Arthur Jensen more recently argued that a ''g'' factor extracted from one test battery will always be the same, within the limits of measurement error, as that extracted from another battery, provided that the batteries are large and diverse.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 151</ref> According to this view, every mental test, no matter how distinctive, calls on ''g'' to some extent. Thus a composite score of a number of different tests will load onto ''g'' more strongly than any of the individual test scores, because the ''g'' components cumulate into the composite score, while the uncorrelated non-''g'' components will cancel each other out. Theoretically, the composite score of an infinitely large, diverse test battery would, then, be a perfect measure of ''g''.<ref>Jensen 1998, 31</ref>\n\nIn contrast, [[L.L. Thurstone]] argued that a ''g'' factor extracted from a test battery reflects the average of all the abilities called for by the particular battery, and that ''g'' therefore varies from one battery to another and \"has no fundamental psychological significance.\"<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 151\u2013153</ref> Along similar lines, [[John L. Horn|John Horn]] argued that ''g'' factors are meaningless because they are not invariant across test batteries, maintaining that correlations between different ability measures arise because it is difficult to define a human action that depends on just one ability.<ref name=\"McGrew 2005\">McGrew 2005</ref><ref>Kvist & Gustafsson 2008</ref>\n\nTo show that different batteries reflect the same ''g'', one must administer several test batteries to the same individuals, extract ''g'' factors from each battery, and show that the factors are highly correlated. This can be done within a confirmatory factor analysis framework.<ref name=\"Hunt 2011, 94\"/> Wendy Johnson and colleagues have published two such studies.<ref>Johnson et al. 2004</ref><ref>Johnson et al. 2008</ref> The first found that the correlations between ''g'' factors extracted from three different batteries were .99, .99, and 1.00, supporting the hypothesis that ''g'' factors from different batteries are the same and that the identification of ''g'' is not dependent on the specific abilities assessed. The second study found that ''g'' factors derived from four of five test batteries correlated at between .95\u20131.00, while the correlations ranged from .79 to .96 for the fifth battery, the [[Culture Fair Intelligence Test|Cattell Culture Fair Intelligence Test]] (the CFIT). They attributed the somewhat lower correlations with the CFIT battery to its lack of content diversity for it contains only matrix-type items, and interpreted the findings as supporting the contention that ''g'' factors derived from different test batteries are the same provided that the batteries are diverse enough. The results suggest that the same ''g'' can be consistently identified from different test batteries.<ref name=\"deary2012\"/><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 150\u2013153. See also Keith et al. 2001 where the ''g'' factors from the [[Cognitive Assessment System|CAS]] and [[Woodcock\u2013Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities|WJ III]] test batteries were found to be statistically indistinguishable, and Stauffer et al. 1996 where similar results were found for the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery|ASVAB]] battery and a battery of cognitive-components-based tests.</ref>\n\n==Population distribution==\n\nThe form of the population distribution of ''g'' is unknown, because ''g'' cannot be measured on a [[ratio scale]]{{clarify|date=March 2018}}. (The distributions of scores on typical IQ tests are roughly normal, but this is achieved by construction, i.e., by [[Normalization (statistics)|normalizing]] the raw scores.) It has been argued{{who|date=May 2017}} that there are nevertheless good reasons for supposing that ''g'' is [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] in the general population, at least within a range of \u00b12 standard deviations from the mean. In particular, ''g'' can be thought of as a composite variable that reflects the additive effects of many independent genetic and environmental influences, and such a variable should, according to the [[central limit theorem]], follow a normal distribution.<ref>Jensen 1998, 88, 101\u2013103</ref>\n\n==Spearman's law of diminishing returns==\nA number of researchers have suggested that the proportion of variation accounted for by ''g'' may not be uniform across all subgroups within a population. ''Spearman's law of diminishing returns'' (SLODR), also termed the ''cognitive ability differentiation hypothesis'', predicts that the positive correlations among different cognitive abilities are weaker among more intelligent subgroups of individuals.  More specifically, (SLODR) predicts that the ''g'' factor will account for a smaller proportion of individual differences in cognitive tests scores at higher scores on the ''g'' factor.\n\n(SLODR) was originally proposed by [[Charles Spearman]],<ref>Spearman, C. (1927). ''The abilities of man''. New York: MacMillan.</ref> who reported that the average correlation between 12 cognitive ability tests was .466 in 78 normal children, and .782 in 22 \"defective\" children.  Detterman and Daniel rediscovered this phenomenon in 1989.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Detterman | first1 = D.K. | last2 = Daniel | first2 = M.H. | year = 1989 | title = Correlations of mental tests with each other and with cognitive variables are highest for low IQ groups | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 349\u2013359 | doi = 10.1016/s0160-2896(89)80007-8 }}</ref> They reported that for subtests of both the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]] and the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]], subtest intercorrelations decreased monotonically with ability group, ranging from approximately an average intercorrelation of .7 among individuals with IQs less than 78 to .4 among individuals with IQs greater than 122.<ref>Deary & Pagliari 1991</ref>\n\n(SLODR) has been replicated in a variety of child and adult samples who have been measured using broad arrays of cognitive tests.  The most common approach has been to divide individuals into multiple ability groups using an observable proxy for their general intellectual ability, and then to either compare the average interrelation among the subtests across the different groups, or to compare the proportion of variation accounted for by a single common factor, in the different groups.<ref name=\"deary et al\">Deary et al. 1996</ref> However, as both Deary et al. (1996).<ref name=\"deary et al\"/> and Tucker-Drob (2009)<ref name=\"Tucker-Drob, E. M. 2009\">Tucker-Drob 2009</ref> have pointed out, dividing the continuous distribution of intelligence into an arbitrary number of discrete ability groups is less than ideal for examining (SLODR).  Tucker-Drob (2009)<ref name=\"Tucker-Drob, E. M. 2009\"/> extensively reviewed the literature on (SLODR) and the various methods by which it had been previously tested, and proposed that (SLODR) could be most appropriately captured by fitting a common factor model that allows the relations between the factor and its indicators to be nonlinear in nature.  He applied such a factor model to a nationally representative data of children and adults in the United States and found consistent evidence for (SLODR). For example, Tucker-Drob (2009) found that a general factor accounted for approximately 75% of the variation in seven different cognitive abilities among very low IQ adults, but only accounted for approximately 30% of the variation in the abilities among very high IQ adults.\n\nA recent meta-analytic study by Blum and Holling<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = D. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | year = 2017 | title = Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns. A meta-analysis | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 60\u201366 | doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2017.07.004 }}</ref> also provided support for the differentiation hypothesis. As opposed to most research on the topic, this work made it possible to study ability and age variables as continuous predictors of the ''g'' saturation, and not just to compare lower- vs. higher-skilled or younger vs. older groups of testees. Results demonstrate that the mean correlation and ''g'' loadings of cognitive ability tests decrease with increasing ability, yet increase with respondent age. (SLODR), as described by [[Charles Spearman]], could be confirmed by a ''g''-saturation decrease as a function of IQ as well as a ''g''-saturation increase from middle age to senescence. Specifically speaking, for samples with a mean intelligence that is two standard deviations (i.e., 30 IQ-points) higher, the mean correlation to be expected is decreased by approximately .15 points. The question remains whether a difference of this magnitude could result in a greater apparent factorial complexity when cognitive data are factored for the higher-ability sample, as opposed to the lower-ability sample. It seems likely that greater factor dimensionality should tend to be observed for the case of higher ability, but the magnitude of this effect (i.e., how much more likely and how many more factors) remains uncertain.\n\n==Practical validity==\n\nThe practical validity of ''g'' as a predictor of educational, economic, and social outcomes is more far-ranging and universal than that of any other known psychological variable. The validity of ''g'' increases as the complexity of the measured task increases.<ref name=\"Jensen 1998, 270\">Jensen 1998, 270</ref><ref>Gottfredson 2002</ref>\n\nA test's practical validity is measured by its correlation with performance on some criterion external to the test, such as college grade-point average, or a rating of job performance. The correlation between test scores and a measure of some criterion is called the ''validity coefficient''. One way to interpret a validity coefficient is to square it to obtain the [[Coefficient of determination|variance accounted]] by the test. For example, a validity coefficient of .30 corresponds to 9 percent of variance explained. This approach has, however, been criticized as misleading and uninformative, and several alternatives have been proposed. One arguably more interpretable approach is to look at the percentage of test takers in each test score [[wikt:quintile|quintile]] who meet some agreed-upon standard of success. For example, if the correlation between test scores and performance is .30, the expectation is that 67 percent of those in the top quintile will be above-average performers, compared to 33 percent of those in the bottom quintile.<ref name=\"sackett2008\">Sackett et al. 2008</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 272, 301</ref>\n\n===Academic achievement===\n\nThe predictive validity of ''g'' is most conspicuous in the domain of scholastic performance. This is apparently because ''g'' is closely linked to the ability to learn novel material and understand concepts and meanings.<ref name=\"Jensen 1998, 270\"/>\n\nIn elementary school, the correlation between IQ and grades and achievement scores is between .60 and .70. At more advanced educational levels, more students from the lower end of the IQ distribution drop out, which restricts the range of IQs and results in lower validity coefficients. In high school, college, and graduate school the validity coefficients are .50\u2013.60, .40\u2013.50, and .30\u2013.40, respectively. The ''g'' loadings of IQ scores are high, but it is possible that some of the validity of IQ in predicting scholastic achievement is attributable to factors measured by IQ independent of ''g''. According to research by [[Robert L. Thorndike]], 80 to 90 percent of the ''predictable'' variance in scholastic performance is due to ''g'', with the rest attributed to non-''g'' factors measured by IQ and other tests.<ref>Jensen 1998, 279\u2013280</ref>\n\nAchievement test scores are more highly correlated with IQ than school grades. This may be because grades are more influenced by the teacher's idiosyncratic perceptions of the student.<ref>Jensen 1998, 279</ref> In a longitudinal English study, ''g'' scores measured at age 11 correlated with all the 25 subject tests of the national [[GCSE]] examination taken at age 16. The correlations ranged from .77 for the mathematics test to .42 for the art test. The correlation between ''g'' and a general educational factor computed from the GCSE tests was .81.<ref name=\"brody2006\">Brody 2006</ref>\n\nResearch suggests that the [[SAT]], widely used in college admissions, is primarily a measure of ''g''. A correlation of .82 has been found between ''g'' scores computed from an IQ test battery and SAT scores. In a study of 165,000 students at 41 U.S. colleges, SAT scores were found to be correlated at .47 with first-year college grade-point average after correcting for range restriction in SAT scores (the correlation rises to .55 when course difficulty is held constant, i.e., if all students attended the same set of classes).<ref name=\"sackett2008\"/><ref>Frey & Detterman 2004</ref>\n\n===Job attainment===\n\nThere is a high correlation of .90 to .95 between the prestige rankings of occupations, as rated by the general population, and the ''average'' general intelligence scores of people employed in each occupation. At the level of individual employees, the association between job prestige and ''g'' is lower \u2013 one large U.S. study reported a correlation of .65 (.72 [[Correction for attenuation|corrected for attenuation]]). Mean level of ''g'' thus increases with perceived job prestige. It has also been found that the [[Statistical dispersion|dispersion]] of general intelligence scores is smaller in more prestigious occupations than in lower level occupations, suggesting that higher level occupations have minimum ''g'' requirements.<ref name=\"s&h\">Schmidt & Hunter 2004</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 292\u2013293</ref>\n\n=== Job performance ===\nResearch indicates that tests of ''g'' are the best single predictors of job performance, with an average validity coefficient of .55 across several meta-analyses of studies based on supervisor ratings and job samples. The average meta-analytic validity coefficient for performance in job ''training'' is .63.<ref>Schmidt & Hunter 2004. These validity coefficients have been corrected for measurement error in the dependent variable (i.e., job or training performance) and for range restriction but not for measurement error in the independent variable (i.e., measures of ''g'').</ref> The validity of ''g'' in the highest complexity jobs (professional, scientific, and upper management jobs) has been found to be greater than in the lowest complexity jobs, but ''g'' has predictive validity even for the simplest jobs. Research also shows that specific aptitude tests tailored for each job provide little or no increase in predictive validity over tests of general intelligence. It is believed that ''g'' affects job performance mainly by facilitating the acquisition of job-related knowledge. The predictive validity of ''g'' is greater than that of work experience, and increased experience on the job does not decrease the validity of ''g''.<ref name=\"Jensen 1998, 270\"/><ref name=\"s&h\"/>\n\nIn a 2011 meta-analysis, researchers found that general cognitive ability (GCA) predicted job performance better than personality ([[Five factor model]]) and three streams of [[emotional intelligence]]. They examined the relative importance of these constructs on predicting job performance and found that cognitive ability explained most of the variance in job performance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O'Boyle Jr.|first=E.

For instance, an employee with low GCA will compensate his/her task performance and OCB, if [[emotional intelligence]] is high.\n\nAlthough these compensatory effects favour [[emotional intelligence]], GCA still remains as the best predictor of job performance.

Although the former is better than subjective ratings, most of studies in job performance and GCA have been based on supervisor performance ratings.

These findings were surprising, considering that the main criteria for assessing these employees would be the objective sales.\n\nIn understanding how GCA is associated job performance, several researchers concluded that GCA affects acquisition of job knowledge, which in turn improves [[job performance]]. In other words, people high in GCA are capable to learn faster and acquire more job knowledge easily, which allow them to perform better. Conversely, lack of ability to acquire job knowledge will directly affect job performance. This is due to low levels of GCA. Also, GCA has a direct effect on job performance. In a daily basis, employees are exposed constantly to challenges and problem solving tasks, which success depends solely on their GCA. These findings are discouraging for governmental entities in charge of protecting rights of workers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Frank L.|date=1 April 2002|title=The Role of General Cognitive Ability and Job Performance: Why There Cannot Be a Debate|journal=Human Performance|volume=15|issue=1\u20132|pages=187\u2013210|doi=10.1080/08959285.2002.9668091|issn=0895-9285}}</ref> Because of the high correlation of GCA on job performance, companies are hiring employees based on GCA tests scores.

The correlation is higher at higher levels of education and it increases with age, stabilizing when people reach their highest career potential in middle age. Even when education, occupation and socioeconomic background are held constant, the correlation does not vanish.<ref>Jensen 1998, 568</ref>\n\n===Other correlates===\n\nThe ''g'' factor is reflected in many social outcomes. Many social behavior problems, such as dropping out of school, chronic welfare dependency, accident proneness, and crime, are negatively correlated with ''g'' independent of social class of origin.<ref>Jensen 1998, 271</ref> Health and mortality outcomes are also linked to ''g'', with higher childhood test scores predicting better health and mortality outcomes in adulthood (see [[Cognitive epidemiology]]).<ref>Gottfredson 2007</ref>\n\n==Genetic and environmental determinants==\n{{Main|Heritability of IQ}}\n\nHeritability is the proportion of phenotypic variance in a trait in a population that can be attributed to genetic factors. The heritability of ''g'' has been estimated to fall between 40 and 80 percent using twin, adoption, and other family study designs as well as molecular genetic methods. Estimates based on the totality of evidence place the heritability of ''g'' at about 50%.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Plomin |first=Robert |last2=Spinath |first2=Frank M. |date=April 2002 |title=Genetics and general cognitive ability (g) |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=169\u2013176 |doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01853-2 |pmid=11912040 |issn=1364-6613}}</ref> It has been found to increase linearly with age. For example, a large study involving more than 11,000 pairs of twins from four countries reported the heritability of ''g'' to be 41 percent at age nine, 55 percent at age twelve, and 66 percent at age seventeen. Other studies have estimated that the heritability is as high as 80 percent in adulthood, although it may decline in old age. Most of the research on the heritability of ''g'' has been conducted in the United States and [[Western Europe]], but studies in Russia ([[Moscow]]), the former [[East Germany]], Japan, and rural India have yielded similar estimates of heritability as Western studies.<ref name=\"deary2012\"/><ref>Deary et al. 2006</ref><ref name=\"plomin&spinath\">Plomin & Spinath 2004</ref><ref>Haworth et al. 2010</ref>\n\nBehavioral genetic research has also established that the shared (or between-family) environmental effects on ''g'' are strong in childhood, but decline thereafter and are negligible in adulthood. This indicates that the environmental effects that are important to the development of ''g'' are unique and not shared between members of the same family.<ref name=\"plomin&spinath\"/>\n\nThe [[genetic correlation]] is a statistic that indicates the extent to which the same genetic effects influence two different traits. If the genetic correlation between two traits is zero, the genetic effects on them are independent, whereas a correlation of 1.0 means that the same set of genes explains the heritability of both traits (regardless of how high or low the heritability of each is). Genetic correlations between specific mental abilities (such as verbal ability and spatial ability) have been consistently found to be very high, close to 1.0. This indicates that genetic variation in cognitive abilities is almost entirely due to genetic variation in whatever ''g'' is. It also suggests that what is common among cognitive abilities is largely caused by genes, and that independence among abilities is largely due to environmental effects. Thus it has been argued that when genes for intelligence are identified, they will be \"generalist genes\", each affecting many different cognitive abilities.<ref name=\"plomin&spinath\"/><ref>Kovas & Plomin 2006</ref><ref name=\"penke2007\">Penke et al. 2007</ref>\n\nThe ''g'' loadings of mental tests have been found to correlate with their heritabilities, with correlations ranging from moderate to perfect in various studies. Thus the heritability of a mental test is usually higher the larger its ''g'' loading is.<ref name=RJ2010>Rushton & Jensen 2010</ref>\n\nMuch research points to ''g'' being a highly [[Polygenic inheritance#Quantitative traits|polygenic trait]] influenced by many common genetic variants, each having only small effects. Another possibility is that heritable differences in ''g'' are due to individuals having different [[Genetic load|\"loads\"]] of rare, deleterious mutations, with genetic variation among individuals persisting due to [[mutation\u2013selection balance]].<ref name=\"penke2007\"/><ref name=\"Chabris\">Chabris et al. 2012</ref>\n\nA number of [[candidate gene]]s have been reported to be associated with intelligence differences, but the effect sizes have been small and almost none of the findings have been replicated. No individual genetic variants have been conclusively linked to intelligence in the normal range so far. Many researchers believe that very large samples will be needed to reliably detect individual genetic polymorphisms associated with ''g''.<ref name=\"deary2012\"/><ref name=\"Chabris\"/> However, while genes influencing variation in ''g'' in the normal range have proven difficult to find, many [[Single gene disorder|single-gene disorders]] with [[mental retardation]] among their symptoms have been discovered.<ref>Plomin 2003</ref>\n\nSeveral studies suggest that tests with larger ''g'' loadings are more affected by [[inbreeding depression]] lowering test scores. There is also evidence that tests with larger ''g'' loadings are associated with larger positive [[Heterosis|heterotic]] effects on test scores. Inbreeding depression and heterosis suggest the presence of [[Dominance (genetics)|genetic dominance effects]] for ''g''.<ref>Jensen 1998, 189\u2013197</ref>\n\n==Neuroscientific findings==\n{{Main|Neuroscience and intelligence}}\n\n''g'' has a number of correlates in the brain. Studies using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) have established that ''g'' and total brain volume are moderately correlated (r~.3\u2013.4). External head size has a correlation of ~.2 with ''g''. MRI research on brain regions indicates that the volumes of [[Frontal cortex|frontal]], [[Parietal cortex|parietal]] and [[Temporal cortex|temporal cortices]], and the [[hippocampus]] are also correlated with ''g'', generally at .25 or more, while the correlations, averaged over many studies, with overall [[grey matter]] and overall [[white matter]] have been found to be .31 and .27, respectively. Some but not all studies have also found positive correlations between ''g'' and cortical thickness. However, the underlying reasons for these associations between the quantity of brain tissue and differences in cognitive abilities remain largely unknown.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nMost researchers believe that intelligence cannot be localized to a single brain region, such as the frontal lobe. Brain [[lesion]] studies have found small but consistent associations indicating that people with more white matter lesions tend to have lower cognitive ability. Research utilizing [[NMR spectroscopy]] has discovered somewhat inconsistent but generally positive correlations between intelligence and white matter integrity, supporting the notion that white matter is important for intelligence.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nSome research suggests that aside from the integrity of white matter, also its organizational efficiency is related to intelligence. The hypothesis that brain efficiency has a role in intelligence is supported by functional MRI research showing that more intelligent people generally process information more efficiently, i.e., they use fewer brain resources for the same task than less intelligent people.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nSmall but relatively consistent associations with intelligence test scores include also brain activity, as measured by [[EEG|EEG records]] or [[event-related potential]]s, and [[nerve conduction velocity]].<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 134\u2013138</ref><ref name=\"chabris2007\">Chabris 2007</ref>\n\n==''g'' in non-humans==\n\n{{Main|g factor in non-humans}}\n\nEvidence of a general factor of intelligence has also been observed in non-human animals.

[[Myopia]] is known to be associated with intelligence, with a correlation of around .2 to .25, and this association has been found within families, too.<ref>Jensen 1998, 146, 149\u2013150</ref>\n\n==Group similarities and differences==\n\n{{See also|Sex and psychology|Race and intelligence|Nations and intelligence}}\n\nCross-cultural studies indicate that the ''g'' factor can be observed whenever a battery of diverse, complex cognitive tests is administered to a human sample. The factor structure of IQ tests has also been found to be consistent across sexes and ethnic groups in the U.S. and elsewhere.<ref name=\"chabris2007\"/> The ''g'' factor has been found to be the most invariant of all factors in cross-cultural comparisons. For example, when the ''g'' factors computed from an American standardization sample of Wechsler's IQ battery and from large samples who completed the Japanese translation of the same battery were compared, the [[congruence coefficient]] was .99, indicating virtual identity. Similarly, the congruence coefficient between the ''g'' factors obtained from white and black standardization samples of the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]] battery in the U.S. was .995, and the variance in test scores accounted for by ''g'' was highly similar for both groups.<ref>Jensen 1998, 87\u201388</ref>\n\nMost studies suggest that there are negligible differences in the mean level of ''g'' between the sexes, and that sex differences in cognitive abilities are to be found in more narrow domains. For example, males generally outperform females in spatial tasks, while females generally outperform males in verbal tasks. Another difference that has been found in many studies is that males show more variability in both general and specific abilities than females, with proportionately more males at both the low end and the high end of the test score distribution.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 360\u2013373</ref>\n\nConsistent differences between racial and ethnic groups in ''g'' have been found, particularly in the U.S. A 2001 meta-analysis of millions of subjects indicated that there is a 1.1 standard deviation gap in the mean level of ''g'' between white and black Americans, favoring the former. The mean score of Hispanic Americans was found to be .72 standard deviations below that of non-Hispanic whites.<ref>Roth et al. 2001</ref> In contrast, Americans of East Asian descent generally slightly outscore white Americans.<ref>Hunt 2011, 421</ref> Several researchers have suggested that the magnitude of the black-white gap in cognitive ability tests is dependent on the magnitude of the test's ''g'' loading, with tests showing higher ''g'' loadings producing larger gaps (see [[Spearman's hypothesis]]).<ref>Jensen 1998, 369\u2013399</ref> It has also been claimed that racial and ethnic differences similar to those found in the U.S. can be observed globally.<ref>Lynn 2003</ref>\n\n==Relation to other psychological constructs==\n\n===Elementary cognitive tasks===\n{{Main|Elementary cognitive task|Mental chronometry}}\n[[Image:Jensen box.gif|right|thumb|300px|An illustration of the [[Jensen box]], an apparatus for measuring choice reaction time.]]\nElementary cognitive tasks (ECTs) also correlate strongly with ''g''.<!--{{Citation needed|reason=Really? According to whom? What?|date=September 2010}} See reference below.--> ECTs are, as the name suggests, simple tasks that apparently require very little intelligence, but still correlate strongly with more exhaustive intelligence tests. Determining whether a light is red or blue and determining whether there are four or five squares drawn on a computer screen are two examples of ECTs. The answers to such questions are usually provided by quickly pressing buttons. Often, in addition to buttons for the two options provided, a third button is held down from the start of the test. When the stimulus is given to the subject, they remove their hand from the starting button to the button of the correct answer. This allows the examiner to determine how much time was spent thinking about the answer to the question (reaction time, usually measured in small fractions of second), and how much time was spent on physical hand movement to the correct button (movement time).  Reaction time correlates strongly with ''g'', while movement time correlates less strongly.<ref>Jensen 1998, 213</ref>\nECT testing has allowed quantitative examination of hypotheses concerning test bias, subject motivation, and group differences.  By virtue of their simplicity, ECTs provide a link between classical IQ testing and biological inquiries such as [[fMRI]] studies.\n\n===Working memory===\n\nOne theory holds that ''g'' is identical or nearly identical to [[Working memory|working memory capacity]]. Among other evidence for this view, some studies have found factors representing ''g'' and working memory to be perfectly correlated. However, in a meta-analysis the correlation was found to be considerably lower.<ref>Ackerman et al. 2005</ref> One criticism that has been made of studies that identify ''g'' with working memory is that \"we do not advance understanding by showing that one mysterious concept is linked to another.\"<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 158</ref>\n\n===Piagetian tasks===\n\nPsychometric theories of intelligence aim at quantifying intellectual growth and identifying ability differences between individuals and groups. In contrast, [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|theory of cognitive development]] seeks to understand qualitative changes in children's intellectual development. Piaget designed a number of tasks to verify hypotheses arising from his theory. The tasks were not intended to measure individual differences, and they have no equivalent in psychometric intelligence tests.<ref name=\"Weinberg 1989\">Weinberg 1989</ref><ref>Lautrey 2002</ref> For example, in one of the best-known Piagetian [[Conservation (psychology)|conservation tasks]] a child is asked if the amount of water in two identical glasses is the same. After the child agrees that the amount is the same, the investigator pours the water from one of the glasses into a glass of different shape so that the amount appears different although it remains the same. The child is then asked if the amount of water in the two glasses is the same or different.\n\nNotwithstanding the different research traditions in which psychometric tests and Piagetian tasks were developed, the correlations between the two types of measures have been found to be consistently positive and generally moderate in magnitude. A common general factor underlies them. It has been shown that it is possible to construct a battery consisting of Piagetian tasks that is as good a measure of ''g'' as standard IQ tests.<ref name=\"Weinberg 1989\"/><ref>Humphreys et al. 1985</ref>\n\n===Personality===\n{{Main|Intelligence and personality}}\nThe traditional view in psychology is that there is no meaningful relationship between [[personality]] and intelligence, and that the two should be studied separately. Intelligence can be understood in terms of what an individual ''can'' do, or what his or her ''maximal'' performance is, while personality can be thought of in terms of what an individual ''will typically'' do, or what his or her general tendencies of behavior are. Research has indicated that correlations between measures of intelligence and personality are small, and it has thus been argued that ''g'' is a purely cognitive variable that is independent of personality traits. In a 2007 meta-analysis the correlations between ''g'' and the [[Big Five personality traits|\"Big Five\"]] personality traits were found to be as follows:\n* conscientiousness \u2212.04\n* agreeableness .00\n* extraversion .02\n* openness .22\n* emotional stability .09\nThe same meta-analysis found a correlation of .20 between [[self-efficacy]] and ''g''.<ref name=\"Stumm2011\">von Stumm et al. 2011</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 573</ref><ref>Judge et al. 2007</ref>\n\nSome researchers have argued that the associations between intelligence and personality, albeit modest, are consistent. They have interpreted correlations between intelligence and personality measures in two main ways. The first perspective is that personality traits influence performance on intelligence ''tests''. For example, a person may fail to perform at a maximal level on an IQ test due to his or her anxiety and stress-proneness. The second perspective considers intelligence and personality to be ''conceptually'' related, with personality traits determining how people apply and invest their cognitive abilities, leading to knowledge expansion and greater cognitive differentiation.<ref name=\"Stumm2011\"/><ref name=\"Stumm2009\">von Stumm et al. 2009</ref>\n\n===Creativity===\n\nSome researchers believe that there is a threshold level of ''g'' below which socially significant [[creativity]] is rare, but that otherwise there is no relationship between the two. It has been suggested that this threshold is at least one standard deviation above the population mean. Above the threshold, personality differences are believed to be important determinants of individual variation in creativity.<ref>Jensen 1998, 577</ref><ref>Eysenck 1995</ref>\n\nOthers have challenged the threshold theory. While not disputing that opportunity and personal attributes other than intelligence, such as energy and commitment, are important for creativity, they argue that ''g'' is positively associated with creativity even at the high end of the ability distribution. The longitudinal [[Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth]] has provided evidence for this contention. It has showed that individuals identified by standardized tests as intellectually gifted in early adolescence accomplish creative achievements (for example, securing patents or publishing literary or scientific works) at several times the rate of the general population, and that even within the top 1 percent of cognitive ability, those with higher ability are more likely to make outstanding achievements. The study has also suggested that the level of ''g'' acts as a predictor of the ''level'' of achievement, while specific cognitive ability patterns predict the ''realm'' of achievement.<ref>Lubinski 2009</ref><ref>Robertson et al. 2010</ref>\n\n==Challenges==\n\n===G''f''-G''c'' theory===\n\n{{Main|Fluid and crystallized intelligence}}\n\n[[Raymond Cattell]], a student of Charles Spearman's, rejected the unitary ''g'' factor model and divided ''g'' into two broad, relatively independent domains: fluid intelligence (G''f'') and crystallized intelligence (G''c''). G''f'' is conceptualized as a capacity to figure out novel problems, and it is best assessed with tests with little cultural or scholastic content, such as Raven's matrices. G''c'' can be thought of as consolidated knowledge, reflecting the skills and information that an individual acquires and retains throughout his or her life. G''c'' is dependent on education and other forms of acculturation, and it is best assessed with tests that emphasize scholastic and cultural knowledge.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/><ref name=\"d&k\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 122\u2013123</ref> G''f'' can be thought to primarily consist of ''current'' reasoning and problem solving capabilities, while G''c'' reflects the outcome of ''previously'' executed cognitive processes.<ref>Sternberg et al. 1981</ref>\n\nThe rationale for the separation of G''f'' and G''c'' was to explain individuals' cognitive development over time. While G''f'' and G''c'' have been found to be highly correlated, they differ in the way they change over a lifetime. G''f'' tends to peak at around age 20, slowly declining thereafter. In contrast, G''c'' is stable or increases across adulthood. A single general factor has been criticized as obscuring this bifurcated pattern of development. Cattell argued that G''f'' reflected individual differences in the efficiency of the [[central nervous system]]. G''c'' was, in Cattell's thinking, the result of a person \"investing\" his or her G''f'' in learning experiences throughout life.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/><ref name=\"horn&mcardle\">Horn & McArdle 2007</ref><ref name=\"d&k\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 123</ref>\n\nCattell, together with John Horn, later expanded the G''f''-G''c'' model to include a number of other broad abilities, such as G''q'' (quantitative reasoning) and G''v'' (visual-spatial reasoning). While all the broad ability factors in the extended G''f''-G''c'' model are positively correlated and thus would enable the extraction of a higher order ''g'' factor, Cattell and Horn maintained that it would be erroneous to posit that a general factor underlies these broad abilities. They argued that ''g'' factors computed from different test batteries are not invariant and would give different values of ''g'', and that the correlations among tests arise because it is difficult to test just one ability at a time.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/><ref name=\"McGrew 2005\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 124</ref>\n\nHowever, several researchers have suggested that the G''f''-G''c'' model is compatible with a ''g''-centered understanding of cognitive abilities. For example, [[John B. Carroll]]'s [[Three stratum theory|three-stratum model of intelligence]] includes both G''f'' and G''c'' together with a higher-order ''g'' factor. Based on factor analyses of many data sets, some researchers have also argued that G''f'' and ''g'' are one and the same factor and that ''g'' factors from different test batteries are substantially invariant provided that the batteries are large and diverse.<ref name=\"d&k\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 125</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 152\u2013153</ref>\n\n===Theories of uncorrelated abilities===\n\nSeveral theorists have proposed that there are intellectual abilities that are uncorrelated with each other. Among the earliest was [[L.L. Thurstone]] who created a model of ''primary mental abilities'' representing supposedly independent domains of intelligence. However, Thurstone's tests of these abilities were found to produce a strong general factor. He argued that the lack of independence among his tests reflected the difficulty of constructing \"factorially pure\" tests that measured just one ability. Similarly, [[J.P. Guilford]] proposed a model of intelligence that comprised up to 180 distinct, uncorrelated abilities, and claimed to be able to test all of them. Later analyses have shown that the factorial procedures Guilford presented as evidence for his theory did not provide support for it, and that the test data that he claimed provided evidence against ''g'' did in fact exhibit the usual pattern of intercorrelations after correction for statistical artifacts.<ref>Jensen 1998, 77\u201378, 115\u2013117</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 52, 239</ref>\n\nMore recently, [[Howard Gardner]] has developed the [[theory of multiple intelligences]]. He posits the existence of nine different and independent domains of intelligence, such as mathematical, linguistic, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, meta-cognitive, and existential intelligences, and contends that individuals who fail in some of them may excel in others. According to Gardner, tests and schools traditionally emphasize only linguistic and logical abilities while neglecting other forms of intelligence. While popular among educationalists, Gardner's theory has been much criticized by psychologists and psychometricians. One criticism is that the theory does violence to both scientific and everyday usages of the word \"intelligence.\" Several researchers have argued that not all of Gardner's intelligences fall within the cognitive sphere. For example, Gardner contends that a successful career in professional sports or popular music reflects bodily-kinesthetic ''intelligence'' and musical ''intelligence'', respectively, even though one might usually talk of athletic and musical ''skills'', ''talents'', or ''abilities'' instead. Another criticism of Gardner's theory is that many of his purportedly independent domains of intelligence are in fact correlated with each other. Responding to empirical analyses showing correlations between the domains, Gardner has argued that the correlations exist because of the [[Common-method variance|common format]] of tests and because all tests require linguistic and logical skills. His critics have in turn pointed out that not all IQ tests are administered in the paper-and-pencil format, that aside from linguistic and logical abilities, IQ test batteries contain also measures of, for example, spatial abilities, and that elementary cognitive tasks (for example, inspection time and reaction time) that do not involve linguistic or logical reasoning correlate with conventional IQ batteries, too.<ref name=\"brody2006\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 128\u2013132</ref><ref>Deary 2001, 15\u201316</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 236\u2013237</ref>\n\n[[Robert Sternberg]], working with various colleagues, has also suggested that intelligence has dimensions independent of ''g''. He argues that there are three classes of intelligence: analytic, practical, and creative. According to Sternberg, traditional psychometric tests measure only analytic intelligence, and should be augmented to test creative and practical intelligence as well. He has devised several tests to this effect. Sternberg equates analytic intelligence with academic intelligence, and contrasts it with practical intelligence, defined as an ability to deal with ill-defined real-life problems. Tacit intelligence is an important component of practical intelligence, consisting of knowledge that is not explicitly taught but is required in many real-life situations. Assessing creativity independent of intelligence tests has traditionally proved difficult, but Sternberg and colleagues have claimed to have created valid tests of creativity, too. The validation of Sternberg's theory requires that the three abilities tested are substantially uncorrelated and have independent predictive validity. Sternberg has conducted many experiments which he claims confirm the validity of his theory, but several researchers have disputed this conclusion. For example, in his reanalysis of a validation study of Sternberg's STAT test, [[Nathan Brody]] showed that the predictive validity of the STAT, a test of three allegedly independent abilities, was almost solely due to a single general factor underlying the tests, which Brody equated with the ''g'' factor.<ref>Hunt 2011, 120\u2013130</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 223\u2013235</ref>\n\n===Flynn's model===\n\n[[Jim Flynn (academic)|James Flynn]] has argued that intelligence should be conceptualized at three different levels: brain physiology, cognitive differences between individuals, and social trends in intelligence over time. According to this model, the ''g'' factor is a useful concept with respect to individual differences but its explanatory power is limited when the focus of investigation is either brain physiology, or, especially, the effect of social trends on intelligence. Flynn has criticized the notion that cognitive gains over time, or the Flynn effect, are \"hollow\" if they cannot be shown to be increases in ''g''. He argues that the Flynn effect reflects shifting social priorities and individuals' adaptation to them. To apply the individual differences concept of ''g'' to the Flynn effect is to confuse different levels of analysis. On the other hand, according to Flynn, it is also fallacious to deny, by referring to trends in intelligence over time, that some individuals have \"better brains and minds\" to cope with the cognitive demands of their particular time. At the level of brain physiology, Flynn has emphasized both that localized neural clusters can be affected differently by cognitive exercise, and that there are important factors that affect all neural clusters.<ref>Flynn 2011</ref>\n\n===Other criticisms===\n\nPerhaps the most famous critique of the construct of ''g'' is that of the paleontologist and biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]], presented in his 1981 book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]''. He argued that psychometricians have fallaciously [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]] the ''g'' factor as a physical thing in the brain, even though it is simply the product of statistical calculations (i.e., factor analysis). He further noted that it is possible to produce factor solutions of cognitive test data that do not contain a ''g'' factor yet explain the same amount of information as solutions that yield a ''g''. According to Gould, there is no rationale for preferring one factor solution to another, and factor analysis therefore does not lend support to the existence of an entity like ''g''. More generally, Gould criticized the ''g'' theory for abstracting intelligence as a single entity and for ranking people \"in a single series of worthiness\", arguing that such rankings are used to justify the oppression of disadvantaged groups.<ref name=\"carroll1995\"/><ref>Gould 1996, 56\u201357</ref>\n\nMany researchers have criticized Gould's arguments. For example, they have rejected the accusation of reification, maintaining that the use of extracted factors such as ''g'' as potential causal variables whose reality can be supported or rejected by further investigations constitutes a normal scientific practice that in no way distinguishes psychometrics from other sciences. Critics have also suggested that Gould did not understand the purpose of factor analysis, and that he was ignorant of relevant methodological advances in the field. While different factor solutions may be mathematically equivalent in their ability to account for intercorrelations among tests, solutions that yield a ''g'' factor are psychologically preferable for several reasons extrinsic to factor analysis, including the phenomenon of the positive manifold, the fact that the same ''g'' can emerge from quite different test batteries, the widespread practical validity of ''g'', and the linkage of ''g'' to many biological variables.<ref name=\"carroll1995\"/><ref name=\"jensen1982\"/><ref>Korb 1994</ref>\n\nJohn Horn and John McArdle have argued that the modern ''g'' theory, as espoused by, for example, Arthur Jensen, is [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]], because the existence of a common factor like ''g'' follows [[Tautology (logic)|tautologically]] from positive correlations among tests. They contrasted the modern hierarchical theory of ''g'' with Spearman's original two-factor theory which was readily falsifiable (and indeed was falsified).<ref name=\"horn&mcardle\"/>\n\nOne critic has argued that ''g'' \"...is to the psychometricians what [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]]' [[aether theories|ether]] was to early physicists: a nonentity taken as an article of faith instead of one in need of verification by real data.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Graves |first=Joseph L. |authorlink=Joseph L.

It is a variable that summarizes positive [[correlation]]s among different cognitive tasks, reflecting the fact that an individual's performance on one type of cognitive task tends to be comparable to that person's performance on other kinds of cognitive tasks. The ''g'' factor typically accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the between-individual performance differences on a given [[cognitive test]], and composite scores (\"IQ scores\") based on many tests are frequently regarded as estimates of individuals' standing on the ''g'' factor.<ref name=\"kamphaus2005\">Kamphaus et al. 2005</ref> The terms ''IQ, general intelligence, general cognitive ability, general mental ability'', and simply ''intelligence'' are often used interchangeably to refer to this common core shared by cognitive tests.<ref name=\"deary2010\">Deary et al. 2010</ref> The ''g'' factor targets a particular measure of  ''general intelligence''.\n\nFor broader coverage of IQ metrics, see [[Intelligence quotient]].\n\nThe existence of the ''g'' factor was originally proposed by the English psychologist [[Charles Spearman]] in the early years of the 20th century. He observed that children's performance ratings, across seemingly unrelated school subjects, were positively [[correlated]], and reasoned that these correlations reflected the influence of an underlying general mental ability that entered into performance on all kinds of mental tests. Spearman suggested that all mental performance could be conceptualized in terms of a single general ability factor, which he labeled ''g'', and many narrow task-specific ability factors. Soon after Spearman proposed the existence of ''g'', it was challenged by [[Godfrey Thomson]], who presented evidence that such intercorrelations among test results could arise even if no ''g''-factor existed.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=THOMSON |first=GODFREY H. |date=September 1916|journal=British Journal of Psychology |language=en |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=271\u2013281 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1916.tb00133.x |issn=0950-5652|title=A Hierarchy Without a General Factor1 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1447717 }}</ref> Today's factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three-level hierarchy, where there are many narrow [[Factor analysis|factors]] at the bottom of the hierarchy, a handful of broad, more general factors at the intermediate level, and at the apex a single factor, referred to as the ''g'' factor, which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks.\n\nTraditionally, research on ''g'' has concentrated on psychometric investigations of test data, with a special emphasis on [[factor analysis|factor analytic]] approaches. However, empirical research on the nature of ''g'' has also drawn upon experimental [[cognitive psychology]] and [[mental chronometry]], brain anatomy and physiology, [[quantitative genetics|quantitative]] and [[molecular genetics]], and [[Evolution of human intelligence|primate evolution]].<ref>Jensen 1998, 545</ref> Some scientists consider ''g'' as a statistical regularity and uncontroversial, and a general cognitive factor appears in data collected from people in nearly every human culture.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Warne|first=Russell T.|last2=Burningham|first2=Cassidy|date=2019|title=Spearman's g found in 31 non-Western nations: Strong evidence that g is a universal phenomenon|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=145|issue=3|pages=237\u2013272|doi=10.1037/bul0000184|pmid=30640496|url=http://psyarxiv.com/uv673/}}</ref> Yet, there is no consensus as to what causes the positive correlations between tests.\n\nResearch in the field of [[behavioral genetics]] has established that the construct of ''g'' is highly [[Heritability of IQ|heritable]]. It has a number of other biological correlates, including [[brain size]]. It is also a significant predictor of individual differences in many social outcomes, particularly in education and employment. The most widely accepted contemporary theories of intelligence incorporate the ''g'' factor.<ref>Neisser et al. 1996</ref> However, critics of ''g'' have contended that an emphasis on ''g'' is misplaced and entails a devaluation of other important abilities. [[Stephen Jay Gould|Stephen J.

Specific domains assessed by tests include mathematical skill, verbal fluency, spatial visualization, and memory, among others. However, individuals who excel at one type of test tend to excel at other kinds of tests, too, while those who do poorly on one test tend to do so on all tests, regardless of the tests' contents.<ref>Gottfredson 1998</ref> The English psychologist Charles Spearman was the first to describe this phenomenon.<ref>Deary 2001, 12</ref> In a famous research paper published in 1904,<ref>Spearman 1904</ref> he observed that children's performance measures across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated. This finding has since been replicated numerous times. The consistent finding of universally positive [[correlation matrix|correlation matrices]] of mental test results (or the \"positive manifold\"), despite large differences in tests' contents, has been described as \"arguably the most replicated result in all psychology\".<ref>Deary 2000, 6</ref> Zero or negative correlations between tests suggest the presence of [[sampling error]] or restriction of the range of ability in the sample studied.<ref name=\"jensen1992\">Jensen 1992</ref>\n\nUsing [[factor analysis]] or related statistical methods, it is possible to compute a single common factor that can be regarded as a summary variable characterizing the correlations between all the different tests in a test battery. Spearman referred to this common factor as the ''general factor'', or simply ''g''. (By convention, ''g'' is always printed as a lower case italic.) Mathematically, the ''g'' factor is ''a source of variance among individuals'', which entails that one cannot meaningfully speak of any one individual's mental abilities consisting of ''g'' or other factors to any specified degrees. One can only speak of an individual's standing on ''g'' (or other factors) compared to other individuals in a relevant population.<ref name=\"jensen1992\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 28</ref><ref name=\"maas\">van deer Maas et al. 2006</ref>\n\nDifferent tests in a test battery may correlate with (or \"load onto\") the ''g'' factor of the battery to different degrees. These correlations are known as ''g'' loadings. An individual test taker's ''g'' factor score, representing his or her relative standing on the ''g'' factor in the total group of individuals, can be estimated using the ''g'' loadings. Full-scale IQ scores from a test battery will usually be highly correlated with ''g'' factor scores, and they are often regarded as estimates of ''g''. For example, the correlations between ''g'' factor scores and full-scale IQ scores from [[David Wechsler]]'s tests have been found to be greater than .95.<ref name=\"kamphaus2005\"/><ref name=\"jensen1992\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 26, 36\u201339</ref> The terms IQ, general intelligence, general cognitive ability, general mental ability, or simply intelligence are frequently used interchangeably to refer to the common core shared by cognitive tests.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nThe ''g'' loadings of mental tests are always positive and usually range between .10 and .90, with a mean of about .60 and a standard deviation of about .15. [[Raven's Progressive Matrices]] is among the tests with the highest ''g'' loadings, around .80. Tests of vocabulary and general information are also typically found to have high ''g'' loadings.<ref>Jensen 1998, 26, 36\u201339, 89\u201390</ref><ref name=\"Jensen 2002\">Jensen 2002</ref> However, the ''g'' loading of the same test may vary somewhat depending on the composition of the test battery.<ref name=\"floyd2009\">Floyd et al. 2009</ref>\n\nThe complexity of tests and the demands they place on mental manipulation are related to the tests' ''g'' loadings. For example, in the forward digit span test the subject is asked to repeat a sequence of digits in the order of their presentation after hearing them once at a rate of one digit per second. The backward digit span test is otherwise the same except that the subject is asked to repeat the digits in the reverse order to that in which they were presented. The backward digit span test is more complex than the forward digit span test, and it has a significantly higher ''g'' loading. Similarly, the ''g'' loadings of arithmetic computation, spelling, and word reading tests are lower than those of arithmetic problem solving, text composition, and reading comprehension tests, respectively.<ref name=\"jensen1992\"/><ref name=\"Jensen 1980, 213\">Jensen 1980, 213</ref>\n\nTest difficulty and ''g'' loadings are distinct concepts that may or may not be empirically related in any specific situation. Tests that have the same difficulty level, as indexed by the proportion of test items that are failed by test takers, may exhibit a wide range of ''g'' loadings. For example, tests of [[rote memory]] have been shown to have the same level of difficulty but considerably lower ''g'' loadings than many tests that involve reasoning.<ref name=\"Jensen 1980, 213\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 94</ref>\n\n==Theories==\n\nWhile the existence of ''g'' as a statistical regularity is well-established and uncontroversial among experts, there is no consensus as to what causes the positive intercorrelations. Several explanations have been proposed.<ref name=\"Hunt 2011, 94\">Hunt 2011, 94</ref>\n\n===Mental energy or efficiency===\n\nCharles Spearman reasoned that correlations between tests reflected the influence of a common causal factor, a general mental ability that enters into performance on all kinds of mental tasks. However, he thought that the best indicators of ''g'' were those tests that reflected what he called ''the eduction of relations and correlates'', which included abilities such as [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], problem solving, grasping relationships, inferring rules, and spotting differences and similarities. Spearman hypothesized that ''g'' was equivalent with \"mental energy\". However, this was more of a metaphorical explanation, and he remained agnostic about the physical basis of this energy, expecting that future research would uncover the exact physiological nature of ''g''.<ref>Jensen 1998, 18\u201319, 35\u201336, 38. The idea of a general, unitary mental ability was introduced to psychology by [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Francis Galton]] in the latter half of the 19th century, but their work was largely speculative, with little empirical basis.</ref>\n\nFollowing Spearman, [[Arthur Jensen]] maintained that all mental tasks tap into ''g'' to some degree. According to Jensen, the ''g'' factor represents a \"distillate\" of scores on different tests rather than a summation or an average of such scores, with factor analysis acting as the [[distillation]] procedure.<ref name=\"Jensen 2002\"/> He argued that ''g'' cannot be described in terms of the item characteristics or information content of tests, pointing out that very dissimilar mental tasks may have nearly equal ''g'' loadings.  Wechsler similarly contended that ''g'' is not an ability at all but rather some general property of the brain. Jensen hypothesized that ''g'' corresponds to individual differences in the speed or efficiency of the neural processes associated with mental abilities.<ref>Jensen 1998, 91\u201392, 95</ref> He also suggested that given the associations between ''g'' and [[#Elementary cognitive tasks|elementary cognitive tasks]], it should be possible to construct a [[ratio scale]] test of ''g'' that uses [[time]] as the unit of measurement.<ref>Jensen 2000</ref>\n\n===Sampling theory===\n\nThe so-called sampling theory of ''g'', originally developed by [[E.L. Thorndike]] and [[Godfrey Thomson]], proposes that the existence of the positive manifold can be explained without reference to a unitary underlying capacity. According to this theory, there are a number of uncorrelated mental processes, and all tests draw upon different samples of these processes. The intercorrelations between tests are caused by an overlap between processes tapped by the tests.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 157</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 117</ref> Thus, the positive manifold arises due to a measurement problem, an inability to measure more fine-grained, presumably uncorrelated mental processes.<ref name=\"maas\"/>\n\nIt has been shown that it is not possible to distinguish statistically between Spearman's model of ''g'' and the sampling model; both are equally able to account for intercorrelations among tests.<ref>Bartholomew et al. 2009</ref> The sampling theory is also consistent with the observation that more complex mental tasks have higher ''g'' loadings, because more complex tasks are expected to involve a larger sampling of neural elements and therefore have more of them in common with other tasks.<ref>Jensen 1998, 120</ref>\n\nSome researchers have argued that the sampling model invalidates ''g'' as a psychological concept, because the model suggests that ''g'' factors derived from different test batteries simply reflect the shared elements of the particular tests contained in each battery rather than a ''g'' that is common to all tests. Similarly, high correlations between different batteries could be due to them measuring the same set of abilities rather than ''the'' same ability.<ref name=\"horn&mcardle\"/>\n\nCritics have argued that the sampling theory is incongruent with certain empirical findings. Based on the sampling theory, one might expect that related cognitive tests share many elements and thus be highly correlated. However, some closely related tests, such as forward and backward digit span, are only modestly correlated, while some seemingly completely dissimilar tests, such as vocabulary tests and Raven's matrices, are consistently highly correlated. Another problematic finding is that brain damage frequently leads to specific cognitive impairments rather than a general impairment one might expect based on the sampling theory.<ref name=\"maas\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 120\u2013121</ref>\n\n===Mutualism===\n\nThe \"mutualism\" model of ''g'' proposes that cognitive processes are initially uncorrelated, but that the positive manifold arises during individual development due to mutual beneficial relations between cognitive processes. Thus there is no single process or capacity underlying the positive correlations between tests. During the course of development, the theory holds, any one particularly efficient process will benefit other processes, with the result that the processes will end up being correlated with one another. Thus similarly high IQs in different persons may stem from quite different initial advantages that they had.<ref name=\"maas\"/><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 157\u2013158</ref> Critics have argued that the observed correlations between the ''g'' loadings and the heritability coefficients of subtests are problematic for the mutualism theory.<ref name=RJ2010/>\n\n===Social exchange and sexual selection===\n{{multiple image\n |align    = right\n |width    = 175\n |direction= vertical\n |image1   = Wason selection task cards.svg\n |caption1 = Each card has a number on one side, and a patch of color on the other.

The purpose is to simplify the correlation matrix by using hypothetical underlying factors to explain the patterns in it. When all correlations in a matrix are positive, as they are in the case of IQ, factor analysis will yield a general factor common to all tests. The general factor of IQ tests is referred to as the ''g'' factor, and it typically accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the variance in IQ test batteries.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 44\u201345</ref> The presence of correlations between many widely varying cognitive tests has often been taken as evidence for the existence of ''g'', but McFarland (2012) showed that such correlations do not provide any more or less support for the existence of ''g'' than for the existence of multiple factors of intelligence.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McFarland |first=Dennis J. |date=2012 |title=A single g factor is not necessary to simulate positive correlations between cognitive tests |journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=378\u2013384 |doi=10.1080/13803395.2011.645018 |issn=1744-411X |pmid=22260190|quote=The fact that diverse cognitive tests tend to be positively correlated has been taken as evidence for a single general ability or \"g\" factor...the presence of a positive manifold in the correlations between diverse cognitive tests does not provide differential support for either single factor or multiple factor models of general abilities.|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b85fe663593c1272f614005da0868967077a754f }}</ref>\n\nCharles Spearman developed factor analysis in order to study correlations between tests. Initially, he developed a model of intelligence in which variations in all intelligence test scores are explained by only two kinds of variables: first, factors that are specific to each test (denoted ''s''); and second, a ''g'' factor that accounts for the positive correlations across tests. This is known as Spearman's two-factor theory. Later research based on more diverse test batteries than those used by Spearman demonstrated that ''g'' alone could not account for all correlations between tests. Specifically, it was found that even after controlling for ''g'', some tests were still correlated with each other. This led to the postulation of ''group factors'' that represent variance that groups of tests with similar task demands (e.g., verbal, spatial, or numerical) have in common in addition to the shared ''g'' variance.<ref>Jensen 1998, 18, 31\u201332</ref>\n\n[[Image:Carroll three stratum model of human Intelligence.png|right|thumb|500px|An illustration of [[John B. Carroll]]'s [[three stratum theory]], an influential contemporary model of cognitive abilities. The broad abilities recognized by the model are fluid intelligence (Gf), crystallized intelligence (Gc), general memory and learning (Gy), broad visual perception (Gv), broad auditory perception (Gu), broad retrieval ability (Gr), broad cognitive speediness (Gs), and processing speed (Gt). Carroll regarded the broad abilities as different \"flavors\" of ''g''.]]\n\nThrough [[Factor analysis#Rotation methods|factor rotation]], it is, in principle, possible to produce an infinite number of different factor solutions that are mathematically equivalent in their ability to account for the intercorrelations among cognitive tests. These include solutions that do not contain a ''g'' factor. Thus factor analysis alone cannot establish what the underlying structure of intelligence is. In choosing between different factor solutions, researchers have to examine the results of factor analysis together with other information about the structure of cognitive abilities.<ref name=\"carroll1995\">Carroll 1995</ref>\n\nThere are many psychologically relevant reasons for preferring factor solutions that contain a ''g'' factor. These include the existence of the positive manifold, the fact that certain kinds of tests (generally the more complex ones) have consistently larger ''g'' loadings, the substantial invariance of ''g'' factors across different test batteries, the impossibility of constructing test batteries that do not yield a ''g'' factor, and the widespread practical validity of ''g'' as a predictor of individual outcomes. The ''g'' factor, together with group factors, best represents the empirically established fact that, on average, overall ability differences ''between'' individuals are greater than differences among abilities ''within'' individuals, while a factor solution with orthogonal factors without ''g'' obscures this fact. Moreover, ''g'' appears to be the most heritable component of intelligence.<ref name=\"jensen1982\">Jensen 1982</ref> Research utilizing the techniques of [[confirmatory factor analysis]] has also provided support for the existence of ''g''.<ref name=\"carroll1995\"/>\n\nA ''g'' factor can be computed from a correlation matrix of test results using several different methods. These include exploratory factor analysis, [[principal components analysis]] (PCA), and confirmatory factor analysis. Different factor-extraction methods produce highly consistent results, although PCA has sometimes been found to produce inflated estimates of the influence of ''g'' on test scores.<ref name=\"floyd2009\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 73</ref>\n\nThere is a broad contemporary consensus that cognitive variance between people can be conceptualized at three hierarchical levels, distinguished by their degree of generality. At the lowest, least general level there are many narrow first-order factors; at a higher level, there are a relatively small number \u2013 somewhere between five and ten \u2013 of broad (i.e., more general) second-order factors (or group factors); and at the apex, there is a single third-order factor, ''g'', the general factor common to all tests.<ref name=\"deary2012\">Deary 2012</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 57</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 46</ref> The ''g'' factor usually accounts for the majority of the total common factor variance of IQ test batteries.<ref>Carroll 1997. The total common factor variance consists of the variance due to the ''g'' factor and the group factors considered together. The variance not accounted for by the common factors, referred to as ''uniqueness'', comprises subtest-specific variance and measurement error.</ref> Contemporary hierarchical models of intelligence include the [[three stratum theory]] and the [[Cattell\u2013Horn\u2013Carroll theory]].<ref name=\"d&k\">Davidson & Kemp 2011</ref>\n\n==\"Indifference of the indicator\"==\n\nSpearman proposed the principle of the ''indifference of the indicator'', according to which the precise content of intelligence tests is unimportant for the purposes of identifying ''g'', because ''g'' enters into performance on all kinds of tests. Any test can therefore be used as an indicator of ''g''.<ref name=\":2\" /> Following Spearman, Arthur Jensen more recently argued that a ''g'' factor extracted from one test battery will always be the same, within the limits of measurement error, as that extracted from another battery, provided that the batteries are large and diverse.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 151</ref> According to this view, every mental test, no matter how distinctive, calls on ''g'' to some extent. Thus a composite score of a number of different tests will load onto ''g'' more strongly than any of the individual test scores, because the ''g'' components cumulate into the composite score, while the uncorrelated non-''g'' components will cancel each other out. Theoretically, the composite score of an infinitely large, diverse test battery would, then, be a perfect measure of ''g''.<ref>Jensen 1998, 31</ref>\n\nIn contrast, [[L.L. Thurstone]] argued that a ''g'' factor extracted from a test battery reflects the average of all the abilities called for by the particular battery, and that ''g'' therefore varies from one battery to another and \"has no fundamental psychological significance.\"<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 151\u2013153</ref> Along similar lines, [[John L. Horn|John Horn]] argued that ''g'' factors are meaningless because they are not invariant across test batteries, maintaining that correlations between different ability measures arise because it is difficult to define a human action that depends on just one ability.<ref name=\"McGrew 2005\">McGrew 2005</ref><ref>Kvist & Gustafsson 2008</ref>\n\nTo show that different batteries reflect the same ''g'', one must administer several test batteries to the same individuals, extract ''g'' factors from each battery, and show that the factors are highly correlated. This can be done within a confirmatory factor analysis framework.<ref name=\"Hunt 2011, 94\"/> Wendy Johnson and colleagues have published two such studies.<ref>Johnson et al. 2004</ref><ref>Johnson et al. 2008</ref> The first found that the correlations between ''g'' factors extracted from three different batteries were .99, .99, and 1.00, supporting the hypothesis that ''g'' factors from different batteries are the same and that the identification of ''g'' is not dependent on the specific abilities assessed. The second study found that ''g'' factors derived from four of five test batteries correlated at between .95\u20131.00, while the correlations ranged from .79 to .96 for the fifth battery, the [[Culture Fair Intelligence Test|Cattell Culture Fair Intelligence Test]] (the CFIT). They attributed the somewhat lower correlations with the CFIT battery to its lack of content diversity for it contains only matrix-type items, and interpreted the findings as supporting the contention that ''g'' factors derived from different test batteries are the same provided that the batteries are diverse enough. The results suggest that the same ''g'' can be consistently identified from different test batteries.<ref name=\"deary2012\"/><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 150\u2013153. See also Keith et al. 2001 where the ''g'' factors from the [[Cognitive Assessment System|CAS]] and [[Woodcock\u2013Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities|WJ III]] test batteries were found to be statistically indistinguishable, and Stauffer et al. 1996 where similar results were found for the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery|ASVAB]] battery and a battery of cognitive-components-based tests.</ref>\n\n==Population distribution==\n\nThe form of the population distribution of ''g'' is unknown, because ''g'' cannot be measured on a [[ratio scale]]{{clarify|date=March 2018}}. (The distributions of scores on typical IQ tests are roughly normal, but this is achieved by construction, i.e., by [[Normalization (statistics)|normalizing]] the raw scores.) It has been argued{{who|date=May 2017}} that there are nevertheless good reasons for supposing that ''g'' is [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] in the general population, at least within a range of \u00b12 standard deviations from the mean. In particular, ''g'' can be thought of as a composite variable that reflects the additive effects of many independent genetic and environmental influences, and such a variable should, according to the [[central limit theorem]], follow a normal distribution.<ref>Jensen 1998, 88, 101\u2013103</ref>\n\n==Spearman's law of diminishing returns==\nA number of researchers have suggested that the proportion of variation accounted for by ''g'' may not be uniform across all subgroups within a population. ''Spearman's law of diminishing returns'' (SLODR), also termed the ''cognitive ability differentiation hypothesis'', predicts that the positive correlations among different cognitive abilities are weaker among more intelligent subgroups of individuals.  More specifically, (SLODR) predicts that the ''g'' factor will account for a smaller proportion of individual differences in cognitive tests scores at higher scores on the ''g'' factor.\n\n(SLODR) was originally proposed by [[Charles Spearman]],<ref>Spearman, C. (1927). ''The abilities of man''. New York: MacMillan.</ref> who reported that the average correlation between 12 cognitive ability tests was .466 in 78 normal children, and .782 in 22 \"defective\" children.  Detterman and Daniel rediscovered this phenomenon in 1989.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Detterman | first1 = D.K. | last2 = Daniel | first2 = M.H. | year = 1989 | title = Correlations of mental tests with each other and with cognitive variables are highest for low IQ groups | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 349\u2013359 | doi = 10.1016/s0160-2896(89)80007-8 }}</ref> They reported that for subtests of both the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]] and the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]], subtest intercorrelations decreased monotonically with ability group, ranging from approximately an average intercorrelation of .7 among individuals with IQs less than 78 to .4 among individuals with IQs greater than 122.<ref>Deary & Pagliari 1991</ref>\n\n(SLODR) has been replicated in a variety of child and adult samples who have been measured using broad arrays of cognitive tests.  The most common approach has been to divide individuals into multiple ability groups using an observable proxy for their general intellectual ability, and then to either compare the average interrelation among the subtests across the different groups, or to compare the proportion of variation accounted for by a single common factor, in the different groups.<ref name=\"deary et al\">Deary et al. 1996</ref> However, as both Deary et al. (1996).<ref name=\"deary et al\"/> and Tucker-Drob (2009)<ref name=\"Tucker-Drob, E. M. 2009\">Tucker-Drob 2009</ref> have pointed out, dividing the continuous distribution of intelligence into an arbitrary number of discrete ability groups is less than ideal for examining (SLODR).  Tucker-Drob (2009)<ref name=\"Tucker-Drob, E. M. 2009\"/> extensively reviewed the literature on (SLODR) and the various methods by which it had been previously tested, and proposed that (SLODR) could be most appropriately captured by fitting a common factor model that allows the relations between the factor and its indicators to be nonlinear in nature.  He applied such a factor model to a nationally representative data of children and adults in the United States and found consistent evidence for (SLODR). For example, Tucker-Drob (2009) found that a general factor accounted for approximately 75% of the variation in seven different cognitive abilities among very low IQ adults, but only accounted for approximately 30% of the variation in the abilities among very high IQ adults.\n\nA recent meta-analytic study by Blum and Holling<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = D. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | year = 2017 | title = Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns. A meta-analysis | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 60\u201366 | doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2017.07.004 }}</ref> also provided support for the differentiation hypothesis. As opposed to most research on the topic, this work made it possible to study ability and age variables as continuous predictors of the ''g'' saturation, and not just to compare lower- vs. higher-skilled or younger vs. older groups of testees. Results demonstrate that the mean correlation and ''g'' loadings of cognitive ability tests decrease with increasing ability, yet increase with respondent age. (SLODR), as described by [[Charles Spearman]], could be confirmed by a ''g''-saturation decrease as a function of IQ as well as a ''g''-saturation increase from middle age to senescence. Specifically speaking, for samples with a mean intelligence that is two standard deviations (i.e., 30 IQ-points) higher, the mean correlation to be expected is decreased by approximately .15 points. The question remains whether a difference of this magnitude could result in a greater apparent factorial complexity when cognitive data are factored for the higher-ability sample, as opposed to the lower-ability sample. It seems likely that greater factor dimensionality should tend to be observed for the case of higher ability, but the magnitude of this effect (i.e., how much more likely and how many more factors) remains uncertain.\n\n==Practical validity==\n\nThe practical validity of ''g'' as a predictor of educational, economic, and social outcomes is more far-ranging and universal than that of any other known psychological variable. The validity of ''g'' increases as the complexity of the measured task increases.<ref name=\"Jensen 1998, 270\">Jensen 1998, 270</ref><ref>Gottfredson 2002</ref>\n\nA test's practical validity is measured by its correlation with performance on some criterion external to the test, such as college grade-point average, or a rating of job performance. The correlation between test scores and a measure of some criterion is called the ''validity coefficient''. One way to interpret a validity coefficient is to square it to obtain the [[Coefficient of determination|variance accounted]] by the test. For example, a validity coefficient of .30 corresponds to 9 percent of variance explained. This approach has, however, been criticized as misleading and uninformative, and several alternatives have been proposed. One arguably more interpretable approach is to look at the percentage of test takers in each test score [[wikt:quintile|quintile]] who meet some agreed-upon standard of success. For example, if the correlation between test scores and performance is .30, the expectation is that 67 percent of those in the top quintile will be above-average performers, compared to 33 percent of those in the bottom quintile.<ref name=\"sackett2008\">Sackett et al. 2008</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 272, 301</ref>\n\n===Academic achievement===\n\nThe predictive validity of ''g'' is most conspicuous in the domain of scholastic performance. This is apparently because ''g'' is closely linked to the ability to learn novel material and understand concepts and meanings.<ref name=\"Jensen 1998, 270\"/>\n\nIn elementary school, the correlation between IQ and grades and achievement scores is between .60 and .70. At more advanced educational levels, more students from the lower end of the IQ distribution drop out, which restricts the range of IQs and results in lower validity coefficients. In high school, college, and graduate school the validity coefficients are .50\u2013.60, .40\u2013.50, and .30\u2013.40, respectively. The ''g'' loadings of IQ scores are high, but it is possible that some of the validity of IQ in predicting scholastic achievement is attributable to factors measured by IQ independent of ''g''. According to research by [[Robert L. Thorndike]], 80 to 90 percent of the ''predictable'' variance in scholastic performance is due to ''g'', with the rest attributed to non-''g'' factors measured by IQ and other tests.<ref>Jensen 1998, 279\u2013280</ref>\n\nAchievement test scores are more highly correlated with IQ than school grades. This may be because grades are more influenced by the teacher's idiosyncratic perceptions of the student.<ref>Jensen 1998, 279</ref> In a longitudinal English study, ''g'' scores measured at age 11 correlated with all the 25 subject tests of the national [[GCSE]] examination taken at age 16. The correlations ranged from .77 for the mathematics test to .42 for the art test. The correlation between ''g'' and a general educational factor computed from the GCSE tests was .81.<ref name=\"brody2006\">Brody 2006</ref>\n\nResearch suggests that the [[SAT]], widely used in college admissions, is primarily a measure of ''g''. A correlation of .82 has been found between ''g'' scores computed from an IQ test battery and SAT scores. In a study of 165,000 students at 41 U.S. colleges, SAT scores were found to be correlated at .47 with first-year college grade-point average after correcting for range restriction in SAT scores (the correlation rises to .55 when course difficulty is held constant, i.e., if all students attended the same set of classes).<ref name=\"sackett2008\"/><ref>Frey & Detterman 2004</ref>\n\n===Job attainment===\n\nThere is a high correlation of .90 to .95 between the prestige rankings of occupations, as rated by the general population, and the ''average'' general intelligence scores of people employed in each occupation. At the level of individual employees, the association between job prestige and ''g'' is lower \u2013 one large U.S. study reported a correlation of .65 (.72 [[Correction for attenuation|corrected for attenuation]]). Mean level of ''g'' thus increases with perceived job prestige. It has also been found that the [[Statistical dispersion|dispersion]] of general intelligence scores is smaller in more prestigious occupations than in lower level occupations, suggesting that higher level occupations have minimum ''g'' requirements.<ref name=\"s&h\">Schmidt & Hunter 2004</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 292\u2013293</ref>\n\n=== Job performance ===\nResearch indicates that tests of ''g'' are the best single predictors of job performance, with an average validity coefficient of .55 across several meta-analyses of studies based on supervisor ratings and job samples. The average meta-analytic validity coefficient for performance in job ''training'' is .63.<ref>Schmidt & Hunter 2004. These validity coefficients have been corrected for measurement error in the dependent variable (i.e., job or training performance) and for range restriction but not for measurement error in the independent variable (i.e., measures of ''g'').</ref> The validity of ''g'' in the highest complexity jobs (professional, scientific, and upper management jobs) has been found to be greater than in the lowest complexity jobs, but ''g'' has predictive validity even for the simplest jobs. Research also shows that specific aptitude tests tailored for each job provide little or no increase in predictive validity over tests of general intelligence. It is believed that ''g'' affects job performance mainly by facilitating the acquisition of job-related knowledge. The predictive validity of ''g'' is greater than that of work experience, and increased experience on the job does not decrease the validity of ''g''.<ref name=\"Jensen 1998, 270\"/><ref name=\"s&h\"/>\n\nIn a 2011 meta-analysis, researchers found that general cognitive ability (GCA) predicted job performance better than personality ([[Five factor model]]) and three streams of [[emotional intelligence]]. They examined the relative importance of these constructs on predicting job performance and found that cognitive ability explained most of the variance in job performance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O'Boyle Jr.|first=E.

[[Emotional intelligence]] is a better predictor of task performance and OCB when GCA is low and vice versa. For instance, an employee with low GCA will compensate his/her task performance and OCB, if [[emotional intelligence]] is high.\n\nAlthough these compensatory effects favour [[emotional intelligence]], GCA still remains as the best predictor of job performance. Several researchers have studied the correlation between GCA and job performance among different job positions. For instance, Ghiselli (1973)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ghiselli|first=E.

Followed by jobs of medium complexity (0.51) and low complexity (0.38).\n\nJob performance is measured by objective rating performance and subjective ratings. Although the former is better than subjective ratings, most of studies in job performance and GCA have been based on supervisor performance ratings. This rating criteria is considered problematic and unreliable, mainly because of its difficulty to define what is a good and bad performance. Rating of supervisors tends to be subjective and inconsistent among employees.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gottfredson|first=L.

These findings were surprising, considering that the main criteria for assessing these employees would be the objective sales.\n\nIn understanding how GCA is associated job performance, several researchers concluded that GCA affects acquisition of job knowledge, which in turn improves [[job performance]]. In other words, people high in GCA are capable to learn faster and acquire more job knowledge easily, which allow them to perform better. Conversely, lack of ability to acquire job knowledge will directly affect job performance. This is due to low levels of GCA. Also, GCA has a direct effect on job performance. In a daily basis, employees are exposed constantly to challenges and problem solving tasks, which success depends solely on their GCA. These findings are discouraging for governmental entities in charge of protecting rights of workers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Frank L.|date=1 April 2002|title=The Role of General Cognitive Ability and Job Performance: Why There Cannot Be a Debate|journal=Human Performance|volume=15|issue=1\u20132|pages=187\u2013210|doi=10.1080/08959285.2002.9668091|issn=0895-9285}}</ref> Because of the high correlation of GCA on job performance, companies are hiring employees based on GCA tests scores.

Some researchers have warned the existence of [[Artifact (error)|statistical artifacts]] related to measures of job performance and GCA test scores.

Moreover, studies on GCA and job performance are always susceptible to range restriction, because data is gathered mostly from current employees, neglecting those that were not hired. Hence, sample comes from employees who successfully passed hiring process, including measures of GCA.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=J. E.|last2=Schmidt|first2=F.

The correlation is higher at higher levels of education and it increases with age, stabilizing when people reach their highest career potential in middle age. Even when education, occupation and socioeconomic background are held constant, the correlation does not vanish.<ref>Jensen 1998, 568</ref>\n\n===Other correlates===\n\nThe ''g'' factor is reflected in many social outcomes. Many social behavior problems, such as dropping out of school, chronic welfare dependency, accident proneness, and crime, are negatively correlated with ''g'' independent of social class of origin.<ref>Jensen 1998, 271</ref> Health and mortality outcomes are also linked to ''g'', with higher childhood test scores predicting better health and mortality outcomes in adulthood (see [[Cognitive epidemiology]]).<ref>Gottfredson 2007</ref>\n\n==Genetic and environmental determinants==\n{{Main|Heritability of IQ}}\n\nHeritability is the proportion of phenotypic variance in a trait in a population that can be attributed to genetic factors. The heritability of ''g'' has been estimated to fall between 40 and 80 percent using twin, adoption, and other family study designs as well as molecular genetic methods. Estimates based on the totality of evidence place the heritability of ''g'' at about 50%.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Plomin |first=Robert |last2=Spinath |first2=Frank M. |date=April 2002 |title=Genetics and general cognitive ability (g) |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=169\u2013176 |doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01853-2 |pmid=11912040 |issn=1364-6613}}</ref> It has been found to increase linearly with age. For example, a large study involving more than 11,000 pairs of twins from four countries reported the heritability of ''g'' to be 41 percent at age nine, 55 percent at age twelve, and 66 percent at age seventeen. Other studies have estimated that the heritability is as high as 80 percent in adulthood, although it may decline in old age. Most of the research on the heritability of ''g'' has been conducted in the United States and [[Western Europe]], but studies in Russia ([[Moscow]]), the former [[East Germany]], Japan, and rural India have yielded similar estimates of heritability as Western studies.<ref name=\"deary2012\"/><ref>Deary et al. 2006</ref><ref name=\"plomin&spinath\">Plomin & Spinath 2004</ref><ref>Haworth et al. 2010</ref>\n\nBehavioral genetic research has also established that the shared (or between-family) environmental effects on ''g'' are strong in childhood, but decline thereafter and are negligible in adulthood. This indicates that the environmental effects that are important to the development of ''g'' are unique and not shared between members of the same family.<ref name=\"plomin&spinath\"/>\n\nThe [[genetic correlation]] is a statistic that indicates the extent to which the same genetic effects influence two different traits. If the genetic correlation between two traits is zero, the genetic effects on them are independent, whereas a correlation of 1.0 means that the same set of genes explains the heritability of both traits (regardless of how high or low the heritability of each is). Genetic correlations between specific mental abilities (such as verbal ability and spatial ability) have been consistently found to be very high, close to 1.0. This indicates that genetic variation in cognitive abilities is almost entirely due to genetic variation in whatever ''g'' is. It also suggests that what is common among cognitive abilities is largely caused by genes, and that independence among abilities is largely due to environmental effects. Thus it has been argued that when genes for intelligence are identified, they will be \"generalist genes\", each affecting many different cognitive abilities.<ref name=\"plomin&spinath\"/><ref>Kovas & Plomin 2006</ref><ref name=\"penke2007\">Penke et al. 2007</ref>\n\nThe ''g'' loadings of mental tests have been found to correlate with their heritabilities, with correlations ranging from moderate to perfect in various studies. Thus the heritability of a mental test is usually higher the larger its ''g'' loading is.<ref name=RJ2010>Rushton & Jensen 2010</ref>\n\nMuch research points to ''g'' being a highly [[Polygenic inheritance#Quantitative traits|polygenic trait]] influenced by many common genetic variants, each having only small effects. Another possibility is that heritable differences in ''g'' are due to individuals having different [[Genetic load|\"loads\"]] of rare, deleterious mutations, with genetic variation among individuals persisting due to [[mutation\u2013selection balance]].<ref name=\"penke2007\"/><ref name=\"Chabris\">Chabris et al. 2012</ref>\n\nA number of [[candidate gene]]s have been reported to be associated with intelligence differences, but the effect sizes have been small and almost none of the findings have been replicated. No individual genetic variants have been conclusively linked to intelligence in the normal range so far. Many researchers believe that very large samples will be needed to reliably detect individual genetic polymorphisms associated with ''g''.<ref name=\"deary2012\"/><ref name=\"Chabris\"/> However, while genes influencing variation in ''g'' in the normal range have proven difficult to find, many [[Single gene disorder|single-gene disorders]] with [[mental retardation]] among their symptoms have been discovered.<ref>Plomin 2003</ref>\n\nSeveral studies suggest that tests with larger ''g'' loadings are more affected by [[inbreeding depression]] lowering test scores. There is also evidence that tests with larger ''g'' loadings are associated with larger positive [[Heterosis|heterotic]] effects on test scores. Inbreeding depression and heterosis suggest the presence of [[Dominance (genetics)|genetic dominance effects]] for ''g''.<ref>Jensen 1998, 189\u2013197</ref>\n\n==Neuroscientific findings==\n{{Main|Neuroscience and intelligence}}\n\n''g'' has a number of correlates in the brain. Studies using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) have established that ''g'' and total brain volume are moderately correlated (r~.3\u2013.4). External head size has a correlation of ~.2 with ''g''. MRI research on brain regions indicates that the volumes of [[Frontal cortex|frontal]], [[Parietal cortex|parietal]] and [[Temporal cortex|temporal cortices]], and the [[hippocampus]] are also correlated with ''g'', generally at .25 or more, while the correlations, averaged over many studies, with overall [[grey matter]] and overall [[white matter]] have been found to be .31 and .27, respectively. Some but not all studies have also found positive correlations between ''g'' and cortical thickness. However, the underlying reasons for these associations between the quantity of brain tissue and differences in cognitive abilities remain largely unknown.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nMost researchers believe that intelligence cannot be localized to a single brain region, such as the frontal lobe. Brain [[lesion]] studies have found small but consistent associations indicating that people with more white matter lesions tend to have lower cognitive ability. Research utilizing [[NMR spectroscopy]] has discovered somewhat inconsistent but generally positive correlations between intelligence and white matter integrity, supporting the notion that white matter is important for intelligence.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nSome research suggests that aside from the integrity of white matter, also its organizational efficiency is related to intelligence. The hypothesis that brain efficiency has a role in intelligence is supported by functional MRI research showing that more intelligent people generally process information more efficiently, i.e., they use fewer brain resources for the same task than less intelligent people.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nSmall but relatively consistent associations with intelligence test scores include also brain activity, as measured by [[EEG|EEG records]] or [[event-related potential]]s, and [[nerve conduction velocity]].<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 134\u2013138</ref><ref name=\"chabris2007\">Chabris 2007</ref>\n\n==''g'' in non-humans==\n\n{{Main|g factor in non-humans}}\n\nEvidence of a general factor of intelligence has also been observed in non-human animals.

The factor structure of IQ tests has also been found to be consistent across sexes and ethnic groups in the U.S. and elsewhere.<ref name=\"chabris2007\"/> The ''g'' factor has been found to be the most invariant of all factors in cross-cultural comparisons. For example, when the ''g'' factors computed from an American standardization sample of Wechsler's IQ battery and from large samples who completed the Japanese translation of the same battery were compared, the [[congruence coefficient]] was .99, indicating virtual identity. Similarly, the congruence coefficient between the ''g'' factors obtained from white and black standardization samples of the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]] battery in the U.S. was .995, and the variance in test scores accounted for by ''g'' was highly similar for both groups.<ref>Jensen 1998, 87\u201388</ref>\n\nMost studies suggest that there are negligible differences in the mean level of ''g'' between the sexes, and that sex differences in cognitive abilities are to be found in more narrow domains. For example, males generally outperform females in spatial tasks, while females generally outperform males in verbal tasks. Another difference that has been found in many studies is that males show more variability in both general and specific abilities than females, with proportionately more males at both the low end and the high end of the test score distribution.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 360\u2013373</ref>\n\nConsistent differences between racial and ethnic groups in ''g'' have been found, particularly in the U.S. A 2001 meta-analysis of millions of subjects indicated that there is a 1.1 standard deviation gap in the mean level of ''g'' between white and black Americans, favoring the former.

What?|date=September 2010}} See reference below.--> ECTs are, as the name suggests, simple tasks that apparently require very little intelligence, but still correlate strongly with more exhaustive intelligence tests. Determining whether a light is red or blue and determining whether there are four or five squares drawn on a computer screen are two examples of ECTs. The answers to such questions are usually provided by quickly pressing buttons. Often, in addition to buttons for the two options provided, a third button is held down from the start of the test. When the stimulus is given to the subject, they remove their hand from the starting button to the button of the correct answer. This allows the examiner to determine how much time was spent thinking about the answer to the question (reaction time, usually measured in small fractions of second), and how much time was spent on physical hand movement to the correct button (movement time).  Reaction time correlates strongly with ''g'', while movement time correlates less strongly.<ref>Jensen 1998, 213</ref>\nECT testing has allowed quantitative examination of hypotheses concerning test bias, subject motivation, and group differences.  By virtue of their simplicity, ECTs provide a link between classical IQ testing and biological inquiries such as [[fMRI]] studies.\n\n===Working memory===\n\nOne theory holds that ''g'' is identical or nearly identical to [[Working memory|working memory capacity]]. Among other evidence for this view, some studies have found factors representing ''g'' and working memory to be perfectly correlated. However, in a meta-analysis the correlation was found to be considerably lower.<ref>Ackerman et al. 2005</ref> One criticism that has been made of studies that identify ''g'' with working memory is that \"we do not advance understanding by showing that one mysterious concept is linked to another.\"<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 158</ref>\n\n===Piagetian tasks===\n\nPsychometric theories of intelligence aim at quantifying intellectual growth and identifying ability differences between individuals and groups. In contrast, [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|theory of cognitive development]] seeks to understand qualitative changes in children's intellectual development. Piaget designed a number of tasks to verify hypotheses arising from his theory. The tasks were not intended to measure individual differences, and they have no equivalent in psychometric intelligence tests.<ref name=\"Weinberg 1989\">Weinberg 1989</ref><ref>Lautrey 2002</ref> For example, in one of the best-known Piagetian [[Conservation (psychology)|conservation tasks]] a child is asked if the amount of water in two identical glasses is the same. After the child agrees that the amount is the same, the investigator pours the water from one of the glasses into a glass of different shape so that the amount appears different although it remains the same. The child is then asked if the amount of water in the two glasses is the same or different.\n\nNotwithstanding the different research traditions in which psychometric tests and Piagetian tasks were developed, the correlations between the two types of measures have been found to be consistently positive and generally moderate in magnitude. A common general factor underlies them. It has been shown that it is possible to construct a battery consisting of Piagetian tasks that is as good a measure of ''g'' as standard IQ tests.<ref name=\"Weinberg 1989\"/><ref>Humphreys et al. 1985</ref>\n\n===Personality===\n{{Main|Intelligence and personality}}\nThe traditional view in psychology is that there is no meaningful relationship between [[personality]] and intelligence, and that the two should be studied separately. Intelligence can be understood in terms of what an individual ''can'' do, or what his or her ''maximal'' performance is, while personality can be thought of in terms of what an individual ''will typically'' do, or what his or her general tendencies of behavior are. Research has indicated that correlations between measures of intelligence and personality are small, and it has thus been argued that ''g'' is a purely cognitive variable that is independent of personality traits. In a 2007 meta-analysis the correlations between ''g'' and the [[Big Five personality traits|\"Big Five\"]] personality traits were found to be as follows:\n* conscientiousness \u2212.04\n* agreeableness .00\n* extraversion .02\n* openness .22\n* emotional stability .09\nThe same meta-analysis found a correlation of .20 between [[self-efficacy]] and ''g''.<ref name=\"Stumm2011\">von Stumm et al. 2011</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 573</ref><ref>Judge et al. 2007</ref>\n\nSome researchers have argued that the associations between intelligence and personality, albeit modest, are consistent. They have interpreted correlations between intelligence and personality measures in two main ways. The first perspective is that personality traits influence performance on intelligence ''tests''. For example, a person may fail to perform at a maximal level on an IQ test due to his or her anxiety and stress-proneness. The second perspective considers intelligence and personality to be ''conceptually'' related, with personality traits determining how people apply and invest their cognitive abilities, leading to knowledge expansion and greater cognitive differentiation.<ref name=\"Stumm2011\"/><ref name=\"Stumm2009\">von Stumm et al. 2009</ref>\n\n===Creativity===\n\nSome researchers believe that there is a threshold level of ''g'' below which socially significant [[creativity]] is rare, but that otherwise there is no relationship between the two. It has been suggested that this threshold is at least one standard deviation above the population mean. Above the threshold, personality differences are believed to be important determinants of individual variation in creativity.<ref>Jensen 1998, 577</ref><ref>Eysenck 1995</ref>\n\nOthers have challenged the threshold theory. While not disputing that opportunity and personal attributes other than intelligence, such as energy and commitment, are important for creativity, they argue that ''g'' is positively associated with creativity even at the high end of the ability distribution. The longitudinal [[Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth]] has provided evidence for this contention. It has showed that individuals identified by standardized tests as intellectually gifted in early adolescence accomplish creative achievements (for example, securing patents or publishing literary or scientific works) at several times the rate of the general population, and that even within the top 1 percent of cognitive ability, those with higher ability are more likely to make outstanding achievements. The study has also suggested that the level of ''g'' acts as a predictor of the ''level'' of achievement, while specific cognitive ability patterns predict the ''realm'' of achievement.<ref>Lubinski 2009</ref><ref>Robertson et al. 2010</ref>\n\n==Challenges==\n\n===G''f''-G''c'' theory===\n\n{{Main|Fluid and crystallized intelligence}}\n\n[[Raymond Cattell]], a student of Charles Spearman's, rejected the unitary ''g'' factor model and divided ''g'' into two broad, relatively independent domains: fluid intelligence (G''f'') and crystallized intelligence (G''c''). G''f'' is conceptualized as a capacity to figure out novel problems, and it is best assessed with tests with little cultural or scholastic content, such as Raven's matrices. G''c'' can be thought of as consolidated knowledge, reflecting the skills and information that an individual acquires and retains throughout his or her life. G''c'' is dependent on education and other forms of acculturation, and it is best assessed with tests that emphasize scholastic and cultural knowledge.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/><ref name=\"d&k\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 122\u2013123</ref> G''f'' can be thought to primarily consist of ''current'' reasoning and problem solving capabilities, while G''c'' reflects the outcome of ''previously'' executed cognitive processes.<ref>Sternberg et al. 1981</ref>\n\nThe rationale for the separation of G''f'' and G''c'' was to explain individuals' cognitive development over time. While G''f'' and G''c'' have been found to be highly correlated, they differ in the way they change over a lifetime. G''f'' tends to peak at around age 20, slowly declining thereafter. In contrast, G''c'' is stable or increases across adulthood. A single general factor has been criticized as obscuring this bifurcated pattern of development. Cattell argued that G''f'' reflected individual differences in the efficiency of the [[central nervous system]]. G''c'' was, in Cattell's thinking, the result of a person \"investing\" his or her G''f'' in learning experiences throughout life.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/><ref name=\"horn&mcardle\">Horn & McArdle 2007</ref><ref name=\"d&k\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 123</ref>\n\nCattell, together with John Horn, later expanded the G''f''-G''c'' model to include a number of other broad abilities, such as G''q'' (quantitative reasoning) and G''v'' (visual-spatial reasoning). While all the broad ability factors in the extended G''f''-G''c'' model are positively correlated and thus would enable the extraction of a higher order ''g'' factor, Cattell and Horn maintained that it would be erroneous to posit that a general factor underlies these broad abilities. They argued that ''g'' factors computed from different test batteries are not invariant and would give different values of ''g'', and that the correlations among tests arise because it is difficult to test just one ability at a time.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/><ref name=\"McGrew 2005\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 124</ref>\n\nHowever, several researchers have suggested that the G''f''-G''c'' model is compatible with a ''g''-centered understanding of cognitive abilities. For example, [[John B. Carroll]]'s [[Three stratum theory|three-stratum model of intelligence]] includes both G''f'' and G''c'' together with a higher-order ''g'' factor. Based on factor analyses of many data sets, some researchers have also argued that G''f'' and ''g'' are one and the same factor and that ''g'' factors from different test batteries are substantially invariant provided that the batteries are large and diverse.<ref name=\"d&k\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 125</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 152\u2013153</ref>\n\n===Theories of uncorrelated abilities===\n\nSeveral theorists have proposed that there are intellectual abilities that are uncorrelated with each other. Among the earliest was [[L.L. Thurstone]] who created a model of ''primary mental abilities'' representing supposedly independent domains of intelligence. However, Thurstone's tests of these abilities were found to produce a strong general factor. He argued that the lack of independence among his tests reflected the difficulty of constructing \"factorially pure\" tests that measured just one ability. Similarly, [[J.P. Guilford]] proposed a model of intelligence that comprised up to 180 distinct, uncorrelated abilities, and claimed to be able to test all of them. Later analyses have shown that the factorial procedures Guilford presented as evidence for his theory did not provide support for it, and that the test data that he claimed provided evidence against ''g'' did in fact exhibit the usual pattern of intercorrelations after correction for statistical artifacts.<ref>Jensen 1998, 77\u201378, 115\u2013117</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 52, 239</ref>\n\nMore recently, [[Howard Gardner]] has developed the [[theory of multiple intelligences]]. He posits the existence of nine different and independent domains of intelligence, such as mathematical, linguistic, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, meta-cognitive, and existential intelligences, and contends that individuals who fail in some of them may excel in others. According to Gardner, tests and schools traditionally emphasize only linguistic and logical abilities while neglecting other forms of intelligence. While popular among educationalists, Gardner's theory has been much criticized by psychologists and psychometricians. One criticism is that the theory does violence to both scientific and everyday usages of the word \"intelligence.\" Several researchers have argued that not all of Gardner's intelligences fall within the cognitive sphere. For example, Gardner contends that a successful career in professional sports or popular music reflects bodily-kinesthetic ''intelligence'' and musical ''intelligence'', respectively, even though one might usually talk of athletic and musical ''skills'', ''talents'', or ''abilities'' instead. Another criticism of Gardner's theory is that many of his purportedly independent domains of intelligence are in fact correlated with each other. Responding to empirical analyses showing correlations between the domains, Gardner has argued that the correlations exist because of the [[Common-method variance|common format]] of tests and because all tests require linguistic and logical skills. His critics have in turn pointed out that not all IQ tests are administered in the paper-and-pencil format, that aside from linguistic and logical abilities, IQ test batteries contain also measures of, for example, spatial abilities, and that elementary cognitive tasks (for example, inspection time and reaction time) that do not involve linguistic or logical reasoning correlate with conventional IQ batteries, too.<ref name=\"brody2006\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 128\u2013132</ref><ref>Deary 2001, 15\u201316</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 236\u2013237</ref>\n\n[[Robert Sternberg]], working with various colleagues, has also suggested that intelligence has dimensions independent of ''g''. He argues that there are three classes of intelligence: analytic, practical, and creative. According to Sternberg, traditional psychometric tests measure only analytic intelligence, and should be augmented to test creative and practical intelligence as well. He has devised several tests to this effect. Sternberg equates analytic intelligence with academic intelligence, and contrasts it with practical intelligence, defined as an ability to deal with ill-defined real-life problems. Tacit intelligence is an important component of practical intelligence, consisting of knowledge that is not explicitly taught but is required in many real-life situations. Assessing creativity independent of intelligence tests has traditionally proved difficult, but Sternberg and colleagues have claimed to have created valid tests of creativity, too. The validation of Sternberg's theory requires that the three abilities tested are substantially uncorrelated and have independent predictive validity. Sternberg has conducted many experiments which he claims confirm the validity of his theory, but several researchers have disputed this conclusion. For example, in his reanalysis of a validation study of Sternberg's STAT test, [[Nathan Brody]] showed that the predictive validity of the STAT, a test of three allegedly independent abilities, was almost solely due to a single general factor underlying the tests, which Brody equated with the ''g'' factor.<ref>Hunt 2011, 120\u2013130</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 223\u2013235</ref>\n\n===Flynn's model===\n\n[[Jim Flynn (academic)|James Flynn]] has argued that intelligence should be conceptualized at three different levels: brain physiology, cognitive differences between individuals, and social trends in intelligence over time. According to this model, the ''g'' factor is a useful concept with respect to individual differences but its explanatory power is limited when the focus of investigation is either brain physiology, or, especially, the effect of social trends on intelligence. Flynn has criticized the notion that cognitive gains over time, or the Flynn effect, are \"hollow\" if they cannot be shown to be increases in ''g''. He argues that the Flynn effect reflects shifting social priorities and individuals' adaptation to them. To apply the individual differences concept of ''g'' to the Flynn effect is to confuse different levels of analysis. On the other hand, according to Flynn, it is also fallacious to deny, by referring to trends in intelligence over time, that some individuals have \"better brains and minds\" to cope with the cognitive demands of their particular time. At the level of brain physiology, Flynn has emphasized both that localized neural clusters can be affected differently by cognitive exercise, and that there are important factors that affect all neural clusters.<ref>Flynn 2011</ref>\n\n===Other criticisms===\n\nPerhaps the most famous critique of the construct of ''g'' is that of the paleontologist and biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]], presented in his 1981 book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]''. He argued that psychometricians have fallaciously [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]] the ''g'' factor as a physical thing in the brain, even though it is simply the product of statistical calculations (i.e., factor analysis). He further noted that it is possible to produce factor solutions of cognitive test data that do not contain a ''g'' factor yet explain the same amount of information as solutions that yield a ''g''. According to Gould, there is no rationale for preferring one factor solution to another, and factor analysis therefore does not lend support to the existence of an entity like ''g''. More generally, Gould criticized the ''g'' theory for abstracting intelligence as a single entity and for ranking people \"in a single series of worthiness\", arguing that such rankings are used to justify the oppression of disadvantaged groups.<ref name=\"carroll1995\"/><ref>Gould 1996, 56\u201357</ref>\n\nMany researchers have criticized Gould's arguments. For example, they have rejected the accusation of reification, maintaining that the use of extracted factors such as ''g'' as potential causal variables whose reality can be supported or rejected by further investigations constitutes a normal scientific practice that in no way distinguishes psychometrics from other sciences. Critics have also suggested that Gould did not understand the purpose of factor analysis, and that he was ignorant of relevant methodological advances in the field. While different factor solutions may be mathematically equivalent in their ability to account for intercorrelations among tests, solutions that yield a ''g'' factor are psychologically preferable for several reasons extrinsic to factor analysis, including the phenomenon of the positive manifold, the fact that the same ''g'' can emerge from quite different test batteries, the widespread practical validity of ''g'', and the linkage of ''g'' to many biological variables.<ref name=\"carroll1995\"/><ref name=\"jensen1982\"/><ref>Korb 1994</ref>\n\nJohn Horn and John McArdle have argued that the modern ''g'' theory, as espoused by, for example, Arthur Jensen, is [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]], because the existence of a common factor like ''g'' follows [[Tautology (logic)|tautologically]] from positive correlations among tests. They contrasted the modern hierarchical theory of ''g'' with Spearman's original two-factor theory which was readily falsifiable (and indeed was falsified).<ref name=\"horn&mcardle\"/>\n\nOne critic has argued that ''g'' \"...is to the psychometricians what [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]]' [[aether theories|ether]] was to early physicists: a nonentity taken as an article of faith instead of one in need of verification by real data.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Graves |first=Joseph L. |authorlink=Joseph L.

He spent six months investigating sheep ranches in California, but decided to try New Mexico, where land was cheaper and more abundant for ranching.  Soon after his arrival in the territorial capital [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], he met lawyer [[Alexander McSween]].\n\nHe told him of the potentially big profits to be made in [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]]. It was being rapidly settled. McSween was allied with [[John Chisum]], (1824\u20131884), the owner of a large ranch and over 100,000 head of cattle. McSween became a business partner of Tunstall, and they both sought Chisum's support.\n\nThe young British man bought a ranch on the Rio Feliz, some {{convert|30|mi|km}} nearly due south of the town of Lincoln, and went into business as a cattleman. In the town he also set up a mercantile store and bank down the road from the [[Lawrence Murphy|Murphy & Dolan]] mercantile and banking operation. It had been established a few years earlier by [[James Dolan (Lincoln County War)|James Dolan]], [[Lawrence Murphy]] and John H. Riley, all of Irish ancestry. The Murphy-Dolan store was known colloquially as \"The House.\"\n\nMurphy and Dolan ran the town and surrounding county of Lincoln as though the area were their fiefdom. Any business transaction of consequence in the county passed through them. They controlled the court. The Sheriff of Lincoln County, [[William J. Brady]], was theirs. Tunstall was eager to make money in Lincoln County. Offering decent prices and reasonable dealings at his store, he attracted locals eager to find a competitor to Murphy and Dolan. This, in turn, threatened to break their business monopoly over the town.\n\n== Death ==\n{{main|Lincoln County War}}\nTunstall\u2019s mercantile business put him into conflict with the powerful political, economic, and judicial structure that ruled [[New Mexico Territory]]. This group of men was known as the [[Santa Fe Ring]]. Ring members included [[Thomas Catron]] (1840-1921), the boss, who was the attorney general of New Mexico Territory. Catron owned {{convert|3000000|acre|km2}} of land, and was one of the largest land holders in the history of the United States. Catron numbered the following men among his colleagues: [[Samuel Beach Axtell]] [1819-1891], the Territorial governor, who was fired for corruption by 19th President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]];[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/61683345 Warren Henry Bristol] [1823-1890], a territorial judge; and [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/91922393/william-logan-rynerson William L. Rynerson] [1828-1893], a district attorney, who had assassinated [[John P. Slough]], the Chief Justice of New Mexico, and gotten away with it. Catron held the mortgage on \"The House,\" so had a direct interest in its success in Lincoln.\n\nWhen too many of the residents of Lincoln switched their business to Tunstall\u2019s store, Murphy-Dolan began a slide into bankruptcy, and Catron\u2019s bottom line was affected. Murphy and Dolan tried to put Tunstall out of business, first harassing him legally, then trying to goad him into a gunfight. They hired [[gunfighter|gunmen]], most of whom were members of the [[Jesse Evans]] Gang, ''aka'' \"The Boys.\"\n\nTunstall recruited supporters of his own: half a dozen local small ranchers and cowboys from those who disliked Murphy and Dolan. These men worked his ranch and protected him while he tried to settle his conflict with Murphy/Dolan. One of Tunstall's employees was the 18-year-old William Bonney (''aka'' Henry McCarty, ''aka'' William Henry Antrim, ''aka'' El Chivato, 1859 [?]- 1881). He was later dubbed as \"[[Billy the Kid]]\" when leading a gang of his own. \n\nOn 18 February 1878, Tunstall, [[Richard M. Brewer]], [[John Middleton (cowboy)|John Middleton]], [[Henry Newton Brown]], [[Robert Widenmann]], [[Fred Waite]] and William Bonney, were driving nine horses from Tunstall's ranch on the Rio Feliz to Lincoln. A posse deputized by Lincoln Sheriff Brady went to Tunstall's ranch on the Feliz to attach his cattle on a warrant that had been issued against his business partner, McSween. Finding Tunstall, his hands, and the horses gone, a sub-posse broke from the main posse and went in pursuit. But these horses were not covered by any legal action.\n\nEvans, Hill, Morton (and probably Frank Baker) rode ahead after Tunstall. Evans, Morton, and Hill caught Tunstall and his men a few miles from Lincoln, in an area covered with scrub timber. Tunstall, the nine horses, and his hands were spread out along the narrow trail. Bonney, who was riding drag, alerted the others. The deputies began firing without warning. Tunstall's hands galloped off through the brush to a hilltop overlooking the trail. Tunstall first stayed with his horses, then rode away, but was pursued by the three deputies.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nOnly the three deputies survived the confrontation. Most historians believe that Tunstall likely surrendered. He was reported as shot through the breast with a rifle, and shot in the back of the head with a revolver.  The posse faked the crime scene, removing Tunstall's gun and firing it, then arranging it near his body. This type of set-up was a common gambit in the Wild West. Not one of the Tunstall group believed the deputies' \"resisting arrest\" account. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe historian Robert Utley suggests that Tunstall may have tried to defend himself when cornered by Morton, Hill, and Evans. Joel Jacobsen notes that Tunstall died some hundred yards from his horses, suggesting the posse wanted him rather than the horses. Other evidence and testimony called into question the official story claimed by the three deputies and supported by the Murphy-Dolan faction.\n\n==Aftermath==\nTunstall's murder ignited the [[Lincoln County War]]. Bonney was especially affected by the murder as Tunstall had always treated him well.\n\nBonney, [[Richard M. Brewer]], [[Chavez y Chavez]], [[Doc Scurlock]], [[Charlie Bowdre]], [[George Coe (Lincoln County War)|George Coe]], [[Frank Coe (Lincoln County War)|Frank Coe]], [[Jim French (cowboy)|Jim French]], [[Frank McNab]] and other employees and friends of Tunstall's went to the Lincoln County Justice of the Peace, \"Squire\" John Wilson. He proved sympathetic to their cause and swore them all in as special constables to bring in Tunstall's killers.  This posse was legal and led by Richard \"Dick\" Brewer, a well-respected ranch owner who had also been Tunstall's foreman. The newly minted peace officers called themselves Regulators and went after Evans, Morton, Hill, and Baker and the others implicated in Tunstall's death. Thus, two legally deputized posses rode at large in Lincoln at war with each other.\n\nThe Regulators tracked down and captured Morton and Baker on March 6, killing them during an alleged escape After returning to Lincoln, they  said the two men had killed McCloskey of the Regulators. The same day Morton and Baker were killed, Evans and Tom Hill were rustling sheep during which Hill was killed and Evans was wounded by the sheep farmer. Several other killings, committed by both the Regulators and the gunmen hired by Murphy-Dolan, followed.\n\nOn April Fool's Day 1878, the Regulators killed [[William J. Brady|William Brady]], the sheriff of Lincoln, along with his deputy, George Hindemann. Half a dozen Regulators, including Bonney, Jim French, and Frank McNab, carried out the reprisals. The Regulators killed [[Buckshot Roberts]] at Blazer's Mills, southwest of Lincoln in area now within the Mescalero Apache Reservation. Their man, Richard Brewer, also died in this shootout.\n\nThe period of July 15 through July 19, 1878, [[Battle of Lincoln, New Mexico|Battle of Lincoln]], became known as \"The Five-Day Battle.\" The U.S. Army from nearby Fort Stanton, under the command of Colonel [[Nathan Dudley]], intervened in the fight and defeated the Regulators. Dudley threatened the Regulators while the Dolanites strutted along Lincoln's street. A new federal law of 1878, passed by a Democratic majority of Congress and in reaction to the former use of military forces in southern states to suppress violence targeting freedmen during the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] era, prohibited the Army from intervening in civilian conflicts.\n\nAfter their loss to the Dolan forces in the Five-Day Battle, the Regulators and their supporters quickly left town. Bonney remained in New Mexico, moving to [[Fort Sumner, New Mexico|Fort Sumner]] on the border of the [[Texas Panhandle]] near the [[Pecos River]]. Bonney operated as a bandit in the area with his own gang, and survived until July 14, 1881, when he was shot and killed at Fort Sumner by Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]] of Lincoln County. Garrett had been given a mandate to get rid of Billy the Kid and his gang.\n\n==Legacy==\nJohn Tunstall lived in Lincoln for about 18 months before being killed by Morton, Hill, and Evans. During this period, he regularly corresponded with his family in London. [[Frederick Nolan]] collected these letters and published them as ''The Life and Death of John Henry Tunstall,'' a basic work in the historiography of the Lincoln County War. Tunstall's letters reflect his ambition, biases, and youthful arrogance and high-spiritedness. They also reflect the economic, cultural, social, and political realities of the time and place. Tunstall's gun is held by the [[Royal Armouries Museum]] in [[Leeds]], UK. (website [http://www.royalarmouries.org/ www.royalarmouries.org]).\n\n==Representation in other media==\n*Tunstall was portrayed by actor [[Murray Matheson]] in the episode \"The Reversed Blade\" (February 4, 1961) of the [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]], ''[[The Tall Man (TV series)|The Tall Man]]''. The series uses the fictional name \"John Tundall\".\n*In the 1958 film ''[[The Left Handed Gun]]'', Tunstall was played by English actor [[Colin Keith-Johnston]]. In the 1970 film ''[[Chisum]],'' he was erroneously portrayed as an elderly gentleman by veteran English actor [[Patric Knowles]]. The [[England|English]] actor [[Terence Stamp]] played Tunstall in the 1988 movie ''[[Young Guns (film)|Young Guns]]''. Keith-Johnston was 62, Knowles 58 and Stamp 50 when they were picked to play the 24-year-old Tunstall. These films tended to portray Tunstall inaccurately as a kind of father figure to William Bonney (Billy the Kid). In fact, he was Billy's employer and good friend.\n*[[John Alderson (actor)|John Alderson]] played Tunstall in the 1966 episode \"The Kid from Hell's Kitchen\" of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] western series, ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]]. In the story line, The Kid ([[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]]) sets out to avenge the death of his friend Tunstall amid the Lincoln County Range War.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556817/?ref_=tt_ep_nx|title=\"The Kid from Hell's Kitchen\" on ''Death Valley Days''|date=October 20, 1966|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}</ref>\n*Tunstall is mentioned in the 2013 video game, ''[[Call of Juarez: Gunslinger]]'', as part of the [[Lincoln County War]].\n*Tunstall is represented in the 2015 \"Billy the Kid\" episode of \"Legends & Lies: The Real West\" on Fox News Channel.\n*Tunstall is represented in the 2016 \"Billy the Kid - The Phantom of Lincoln County\" episode of \"Legends of the West\" on American Heroes Channel.\n*Tunstall is mentioned in the 2019 semi-biographical novel of John Chisum's life, by Russ Brown, titled ''Miss Chisum''.<ref>Brown, Russ, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1527241246 Miss Chisum], Amazon and Kindle.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Fulton, Maurice Garland.

Their man, Richard Brewer, also died in this shootout.\n\nThe period of July 15 through July 19, 1878, [[Battle of Lincoln, New Mexico|Battle of Lincoln]], became known as \"The Five-Day Battle.\" The U.S. Army from nearby Fort Stanton, under the command of Colonel [[Nathan Dudley]], intervened in the fight and defeated the Regulators. Dudley threatened the Regulators while the Dolanites strutted along Lincoln's street. A new federal law of 1878, passed by a Democratic majority of Congress and in reaction to the former use of military forces in southern states to suppress violence targeting freedmen during the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] era, prohibited the Army from intervening in civilian conflicts.\n\nAfter their loss to the Dolan forces in the Five-Day Battle, the Regulators and their supporters quickly left town. Bonney remained in New Mexico, moving to [[Fort Sumner, New Mexico|Fort Sumner]] on the border of the [[Texas Panhandle]] near the [[Pecos River]]. Bonney operated as a bandit in the area with his own gang, and survived until July 14, 1881, when he was shot and killed at Fort Sumner by Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]] of Lincoln County. Garrett had been given a mandate to get rid of Billy the Kid and his gang.\n\n==Legacy==\nJohn Tunstall lived in Lincoln for about 18 months before being killed by Morton, Hill, and Evans. During this period, he regularly corresponded with his family in London. [[Frederick Nolan]] collected these letters and published them as ''The Life and Death of John Henry Tunstall,'' a basic work in the historiography of the Lincoln County War. Tunstall's letters reflect his ambition, biases, and youthful arrogance and high-spiritedness. They also reflect the economic, cultural, social, and political realities of the time and place. Tunstall's gun is held by the [[Royal Armouries Museum]] in [[Leeds]], UK. (website [http://www.royalarmouries.org/ www.royalarmouries.org]).\n\n==Representation in other media==\n*Tunstall was portrayed by actor [[Murray Matheson]] in the episode \"The Reversed Blade\" (February 4, 1961) of the [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]], ''[[The Tall Man (TV series)|The Tall Man]]''. The series uses the fictional name \"John Tundall\".\n*In the 1958 film ''[[The Left Handed Gun]]'', Tunstall was played by English actor [[Colin Keith-Johnston]]. In the 1970 film ''[[Chisum]],'' he was erroneously portrayed as an elderly gentleman by veteran English actor [[Patric Knowles]]. The [[England|English]] actor [[Terence Stamp]] played Tunstall in the 1988 movie ''[[Young Guns (film)|Young Guns]]''. Keith-Johnston was 62, Knowles 58 and Stamp 50 when they were picked to play the 24-year-old Tunstall. These films tended to portray Tunstall inaccurately as a kind of father figure to William Bonney (Billy the Kid). In fact, he was Billy's employer and good friend.\n*[[John Alderson (actor)|John Alderson]] played Tunstall in the 1966 episode \"The Kid from Hell's Kitchen\" of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] western series, ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]]. In the story line, The Kid ([[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]]) sets out to avenge the death of his friend Tunstall amid the Lincoln County Range War.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556817/?ref_=tt_ep_nx|title=\"The Kid from Hell's Kitchen\" on ''Death Valley Days''|date=October 20, 1966|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Andrew Bicknell]] played Tunstall in the 1989 [[television film]] ''[[Billy the Kid (1989 film)]]''\n*Tunstall is played by Terrence Stamp in the 1988 cult film \"Young Guns\" that covers the meeting of Tunstall and Bonney through the aftermath and the Lincoln County War, this was also followed up with \"Young Guns 2\"\n*Tunstall is mentioned in the 2013 video game, ''[[Call of Juarez: Gunslinger]]'', as part of the [[Lincoln County War]].\n*Tunstall is represented in the 2015 \"Billy the Kid\" episode of \"Legends & Lies: The Real West\" on Fox News Channel.\n*Tunstall is represented in the 2016 \"Billy the Kid - The Phantom of Lincoln County\" episode of \"Legends of the West\" on American Heroes Channel.\n*Tunstall is mentioned in the 2019 semi-biographical novel of John Chisum's life, by Russ Brown, titled ''Miss Chisum''.<ref>Brown, Russ, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1527241246 Miss Chisum], Amazon and Kindle.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Fulton, Maurice Garland.

It is the fifth main game in the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' series]] and a direct sequel to 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', and was released on March 20, 2020, for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and [[Xbox One]], with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version planned for a release at a later date. The game received positive reviews, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design, soundtrack and combat mechanics, while some disliked the game's increased focus on storytelling.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers once again take on the role of the [[Doom Slayer]], an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of [[Hell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game continues [[Doom (2016 video game)|its predecessor's]] emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" [[energy sword]] and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a [[grappling hook]], useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.<ref name=\"GIPre\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/10/a-bigger-badder-bloodier-demon-fest |title=Doom Eternal: A Bigger, Badder, Bloodier Demon Fest |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |date=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/ |title=Everything we know about Doom Eternal |first=Tom |last=Senior |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: 15 Minutes of DOOM Eternal Gameplay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyKppM68qs|language=en|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nLike its [[Doom (2016 video game)|predecessor]], ''Doom Eternal'' involves the player to develop simple tactics. As the game gets harder, the player needs to use the advantages of fight arenas and their bonuses smarter. They also need to decide which enemy has to be killed firstly and how to move on the battlefield.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-single-player-review|title=Doom Eternal Single-Player Review|last=McCaffrey|first=Ryan|date=April 8, 2020|website=IGN|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145|title=Doom Eternal: The Kotaku Review|last=Alexandra|first=Heather|date=March 24, 2020|website=Kotaku|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-eternal-review-intelligent-inferno/1900-6417432/|title=Doom Eternal Review - Intelligent Inferno|last=Hornshaw|first=Phil|date=March 27, 2020|website=GameSpot|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCreative director Hugo Martin has stated there would be twice as many demon types as in the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 reboot]]. There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called \"Destructible Demons\" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including \"Battlemode\". This game type is a 2v1 [[Player versus player|PvP]] multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a \"summoning wheel\", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. An additional mode, called \"Invasion\", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/doom-eternal-delayed/|title=DOOM Eternal Delayed To March 2020; Invasion Mode To Come After Launch|last=Meo|first=Francesco De|date=October 8, 2019|website=Wccftech|language=en-US|access-date=January 24, 2020}}</ref> In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-6-most-metal-things-in-the-doom-eternal-reveal/ |title=The 6 most metal things in the Doom Eternal reveal |first=Christopher |last=Livington |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/doom-eternal-reveals-new-powers-puts-hell-back-on-earth/ |title=Doom Eternal ushers in idTech 7, bloody new powers |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=August 11, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso new to the game is the hub area, called \"Fortress of Doom\", which players can visit between missions, containing a number of rooms with upgrades and gear locked behind doors.

What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of ARC, a resistance movement formed to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a satellite fortress controlled by the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests; Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to [[New York City]] and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr teleports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.\n\nAfter retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to [[Hell]] to retrieve a power source from a fallen Sentinel known as the Betrayer. He warns the Slayer that humanity's time has come before giving him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to a citadel in the [[Arctic]] where Deag Ranak has taken refuge, and the Slayer kills him after defeating his guardian Doom Hunters.\n\nIn response, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a hidden location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. Forced to change tactics, the Slayer destroys the Super Gore Nest in central Europe, where the invasion began. With no leads on finding the last Hell Priest, VEGA suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows the location of Deag Grav. The Slayer makes his way to an ARC compound where he retrieves Hayden\u2019s robot chassis as well as the Crucible before facing a Marauder, a demonic Sentinel sent to stop the Slayer. \n\nUpon uploading Hayden\u2019s mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime. With the only portal to Sentinel Prime located in the ancient city of Hebeth in Mars\u2019s core, the Slayer travels to a facility on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] where he uses the [[BFG (weapon)| BFG 10000]] to shoot a hole in Mars and makes his way to Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, flashbacks reveal the Slayer to be [[Doomguy]]. Found badly wounded by Sentinels, Doomguy was brought before the Deags and was subjected to fight in a gladiatorial arena. Impressed by Doomguy\u2019s ruthlessness in battle, the Deag\u2019s inducted him into the Sentinels while the Khan Maykr inquires into Doomguy\u2019s knowledge of the Demons. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena and defeats a massive demon known as the Gladiator. Despite knowing that it is against Sentinel law to murder Deag Grav on sacred ground, the Slayer kills him and returns to the fortress.\n\nUpon his return, the Slayer's fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr to prevent any further interference in her plans. She reveals her intentions to resurrect the demon world-eating super-predator, the [[Baphomet|Icon of Sin]], to consume mankind before having the Slayer attacked by demons. Surviving the ambush, the Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. \n\nFurther flashbacks reveal that during the ill fated battle of Argent d'Nur, a rogue Maykr known as [[Seraph]] had imbued Doomguy with superior abilities, transforming him into the Doom Slayer. After retrieving the hilt of the Crucible, it is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, Urdak, to survive.\n\nHayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to the Urdak. He then finds the Khan Maykr and stops the ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon\u2019s heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens from its dormant state and teleports to Earth. The Icon\u2019s awakening also breaks the alliance between the Maykrs and Demons, who proceed to invade Urdak. The Khan Maykr confronts the Slayer, saying that Urdak must destroy Earth to survive.

It is the fifth main game in the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' series]] and a direct sequel to 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', and was released on March 20th, 2020, for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and [[Xbox One]], with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version planned for a release at a later date. The game received positive reviews, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design, soundtrack and combat mechanics, while some disliked the game's increased focus on storytelling.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers once again take on the role of the [[Doom Slayer]], an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of [[Hell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game continues [[Doom (2016 video game)|its predecessor's]] emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" [[energy sword]] and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a [[grappling hook]], useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.<ref name=\"GIPre\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/10/a-bigger-badder-bloodier-demon-fest |title=Doom Eternal: A Bigger, Badder, Bloodier Demon Fest |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |date=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/ |title=Everything we know about Doom Eternal |first=Tom |last=Senior |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: 15 Minutes of DOOM Eternal Gameplay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyKppM68qs|language=en|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nLike its [[Doom (2016 video game)|predecessor]], ''Doom Eternal'' involves the player to develop simple tactics. As the game gets harder, the player needs to use the advantages of fight arenas and their bonuses smarter. They also need to decide which enemy has to be killed firstly and how to move on the battlefield.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-single-player-review|title=Doom Eternal Single-Player Review|last=McCaffrey|first=Ryan|date=April 8, 2020|website=IGN|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145|title=Doom Eternal: The Kotaku Review|last=Alexandra|first=Heather|date=March 24, 2020|website=Kotaku|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-eternal-review-intelligent-inferno/1900-6417432/|title=Doom Eternal Review - Intelligent Inferno|last=Hornshaw|first=Phil|date=March 27, 2020|website=GameSpot|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCreative director Hugo Martin has stated there would be twice as many demon types as in the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 reboot]]. There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called \"Destructible Demons\" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including \"Battlemode\". This game type is a 2v1 [[Player versus player|PvP]] multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch.

What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of ARC, a resistance movement formed to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a satellite fortress controlled by the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests; Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to [[New York City]] and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr teleports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.\n\nAfter retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to [[Hell]] to retrieve a power source from a fallen Sentinel known as the Betrayer. He warns the Slayer that humanity's time has come before giving him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to a citadel in the [[Arctic]] where Deag Ranak has taken refuge, and the Slayer kills him after defeating his guardian Doom Hunters.\n\nIn response, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a hidden location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. Forced to change tactics, the Slayer destroys the Super Gore Nest in central Europe, where the invasion began. With no leads on finding the last Hell Priest, VEGA suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows the location of Deag Grav. The Slayer makes his way to an ARC compound where he retrieves Hayden\u2019s robot chassis as well as the Crucible before facing a Marauder, a demonic Sentinel sent to stop the Slayer. \n\nUpon uploading Hayden\u2019s mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime. With the only portal to Sentinel Prime located in the ancient city of Hebeth in Mars\u2019s core, the Slayer travels to a facility on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] where he uses the [[BFG (weapon)| BFG 10000]] to shoot a hole in Mars and makes his way to Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, flashbacks reveal the Slayer to be [[Doomguy]]. Found badly wounded by Sentinels, Doomguy was brought before the Deags and was subjected to fight in a gladiatorial arena. Impressed by Doomguy\u2019s ruthlessness in battle, the Deag\u2019s inducted him into the Sentinels while the Khan Maykr inquires into Doomguy\u2019s knowledge of the Demons. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena and defeats a massive demon known as the Gladiator. Despite knowing that it is against Sentinel law to murder Deag Grav on sacred ground, the Slayer kills him and returns to the fortress.\n\nUpon his return, the Slayer's fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr to prevent any further interference in her plans. She reveals her intentions to resurrect the demon world-eating super-predator, the [[Baphomet|Icon of Sin]], to consume mankind before having the Slayer attacked by demons. Surviving the ambush, the Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. \n\nFurther flashbacks reveal that during the ill fated battle of Argent d'Nur, a rogue Maykr known as [[Seraph]] had imbued Doomguy with superior abilities, transforming him into the Doom Slayer. After retrieving the hilt of the Crucible, it is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, Urdak, to survive.\n\nHayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to the Urdak. He then finds the Khan Maykr and stops the ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon\u2019s heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens from its dormant state and teleports to Earth. The Icon\u2019s awakening also breaks the alliance between the Maykrs and Demons, who proceed to invade Urdak. The Khan Maykr confronts the Slayer, saying that Urdak must destroy Earth to survive. They battle and the Slayer kills the Khan Maykr before taking a portal back to Earth to confront the Icon of Sin, although VEGA is left behind to ensure the portal stays open. After an intense battle across the cityscape, the Slayer kills the Icon of Sin by stabbing it in the head with the Crucible, putting an end to Hell\u2019s invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development and release==\nPublisher [[Bethesda Softworks]] announced the game at [[E3 2018]], with the first gameplay footage being unveiled at [[QuakeCon]] 2018.

Two varieties of the mint flavor, known as \"Mentos Strong\" and \"Air action Mentos\" are sold in the Netherlands. Also available in the Netherlands is the Special Mix 4 pack, containing the flavors mint, fruit, berry mix, strawberry, banana, cherry, and mango orange. Two varieties of the [[Spearmint (flavour)|mint]] flavor are also sold in China, known as \"Mint\" and \"Strong Mint.\" Grape and 'N Cream (presumably Apples and Cream), Strawberry 'N Cream, and Banana 'N Cream are also marketed in Asia. [[Chocolate]] Mentos were produced in 1989, but the flavor was discontinued. In 2006, the citrus mango flavor was introduced to the Japanese market. In the Philippines, a \"Dalandan Fresh\" variant is available. Other varieties of Mentos include: Mentos Sours, which recently became available in the United States, featuring Watermelon, Green Apple, and Lemon flavors; caffeinated \"Energy\" Mentos, sold mainly in Germany, where one roll equals the amount of caffeine in two cups of coffee; \"Fresh Cola\" flavored Mentos released in New Zealand, Australia and parts of Europe and Asia; and \"AIR Mentos\" containing [[Menthol]], which are sold primarily in Belgium and the Netherlands.

Four novel flavors feature in the \"New Rainbow\" variety {{convert|37.5|g}} rollpack: Kiwi, Cranberry, Caramel and [[Yuzu]] (a Korean/Japanese sour mandarin flavor). Mentos Gum is also available in Peppermint, Spearmint and Orangemint.\n\nThe UK has five current flavors of rolls:\n*Fruit (Orange, lemon and strawberry)\n*Mint\n*Spearmint\n*Rainbow (with 2 flavors of each of the following: Strawberry, Apple, Raspberry, Orange, Watermelon, Blueberry & Pink Grapefruit (the last two are new flavors for 2015).\n*Tutti-Frutti - bubblegum flavored - new for 2012.\n\nIn the UK, Mentos Gum is also available in stick packs (peppermint, spearmint, pure white, air action (menthol) and fruit), Bottles (spearmint, peppermint and red fruit - which retails for approximately \u00a30.99), as well as flip top boxes. Flavours include peppermint or spearmint with green tea extract, and a pure white with white tea extract. Sugar free versions are available, but these are rarer to find, usually only found in large supermarkets. Mentos gum holds a 4% market share of the UK gum market. A new Mentos 3 was launched in January 2011, in two flavors - mint and Strawberry/Apple/Raspberry, which are similar to Wrigleys' 5 in packaging.

Shot in South Africa, individuals facing various day-to-day dilemmas consume Mentos and are subsequently inspired to solve their problems at hand in a creative, often-humorous fashion. For example, a job interviewee sits on a freshly painted bench, staining his suit, and then solves the problem by rolling around on the bench until his suit has pinstripes. Another features a woman whose parked car is boxed in; she calls a crew of construction workers over who lift her car onto the road for her. These unusual behaviors are typically witnessed by nearby, sometimes antagonistic characters, and a roll of Mentos is boisterously displayed by the commercial's respective protagonist to the observer as an explanation for their actions. The ad campaign was parodied in multiple television shows and music videos,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} including the Foo Fighters' \"[[Big Me]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/01/31/foo_fighters_get_hit_with_mentos_excited |title=Foo Fighters Get Hit With Mentos; Excited About Unusual Grammy Nomination |publisher=Starpulse.com |date=31 January 2006 |accessdate=6 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012031807/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/01/31/foo_fighters_get_hit_with_mentos_excited |archivedate=12 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn India, the slogan of Mentos is 'Mentos Khao Dimaag Ki bati jalao' which roughly translates to 'Eat Mentos and ignite the spark in your mind'. TV ads are generally based on a situation where a person facing a problem suddenly has a brainwave after eating Mentos and solves the problem innovatively.\n\nAnother Mentos advert highlighted the multicolored variety of the sweets by showing a scene where two young lovers are sitting in a living room. The teen girl screams as a small seemingly harmless spider crawls across the carpet. This prompts the teen boy to get off the couch that they are sitting on and pick up the spider, only to be violently thrown about by the spider. The slogan at the end reads \"sometimes it's best to be ready for the next thing\"\n\nMentos in Arabic countries, such as Egypt or Morocco, are often sold in smaller rolls roughly half the size of a regular Mentos roll.\n\n==Reaction with soft drink==\n[[File:Diet Coke Mentos.jpg|thumb|187px|right|A [[Diet Coke]] bottle, shortly after Mentos were dropped into it.]]\n{{Main|Diet Coke and Mentos eruption}}\n\nFirst demonstrated by chemistry teacher Lee Marek on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on September 14, 1999,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.uic.edu/marek/letterman0/video/mentos.htm|title = Video of Lee Marek on David Letterman Show, September 14, 1999|publisher=Chem.uic.edu|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref> and later popularized in a June 2006<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=%22Diet%20Coke%20and%20Mentos%22&cmpt=q | title = Google Insights timeline histogram of search topic 'Diet Coke and Mentos'|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>  viral Internet video by [[Eepybird]], a Mentos mint expedites a rapid release of carbon dioxide when dropped into a [[carbonation|carbonated liquid]], such as a [[soft drink]]. ''[[MythBusters]]'' concluded that the [[potassium benzoate]], [[aspartame]], and CO<sub>2</sub> gas contained in the Diet Coke, in combination with the [[gelatin]] and [[gum arabic]] ingredients of the Mentos, all contribute to the formation of the foam.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Mentos and Soda |episodelink=MythBusters_(2006_season)#Episode_57_.E2.80.93_.22Diet_Coke_and_Mentos.22 |series=MythBusters |serieslink=MythBusters |network=[[Discovery Channel]] |date=9 August 2006 |season=4 |number=14}}</ref>\n\nThe structure of the Mentos is the most significant cause of the eruption due to [[nucleation]]. ''MythBusters'' reported that when fruit-flavored Mentos with a smooth waxy coating were tested in [[carbonated drink]] there was hardly a reaction, whereas mint-flavored Mentos (with no such coating) added to carbonated drink formed an energetic eruption, supporting the nucleation-site theory. According to ''MythBusters'', the surface of the mint Mentos is covered with many small holes that increase the [[surface area]] available for reaction (and thus the quantity of reagents exposed to each other at any given time), thereby allowing CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles to form with the rapidity and quantity necessary for the \"jet\"-, \"geyser\"-, or \"eruption\"-like nature of the effusion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mythbusters: Diet Coke and Mentos MiniMyth|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/mythbusters-diet-coke-and-mentos.html|publisher=[[Discovery Channel]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502042917/http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/mythbusters-diet-coke-and-mentos.html|archivedate=2 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThis [[hypothesis]] gained further support when [[rock salt]] was used as a \"jump start\" to the reaction. A paper by Tonya Coffey, a physicist at [[Appalachian State University]] in Boone, North Carolina, confirmed that the rough surface of the Mentos candy helps speed the reaction. Coffey also found that the [[aspartame]] in diet soda lowers the [[surface tension]] and causes a bigger reaction, but that caffeine does not accelerate the reaction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14114-science-of-mentosdiet-coke-explosions-explained.html |title=Science of Mentos-Diet Coke explosions explained |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=12 June 2008 |first=Hazel |last=Muir |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1119/1.2888546 |title=Diet Coke and Mentos: What is really behind this physical reaction? | last=Coffey |first=Tonya Shea | journal=American Journal of Physics |date=June 2008 | volume=76 | issue=6 | pages=551\u2013557}}\n</ref> On the other hand, it has been shown that a wide variety of beverage additives such as sugars, citric acid, and natural flavors also enhance fountain heights.&nbsp;In some cases, dissolved solids that&nbsp;'''''increase'''''&nbsp;the surface tension of water (such as sugars) also increase fountain heights.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kuntzleman|first=Thomas S.|last2=Davenport|first2=Laura S.|last3=Cothran|first3=Victoria I.|last4=Kuntzleman|first4=Jacob T.|last5=Campbell|first5=Dean J.|date=2017-02-23|title=New Demonstrations and New Insights on the Mechanism of the Candy-Cola Soda Geyser|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=94|issue=5|pages=569\u2013576|doi=10.1021/acs.jchemed.6b00862|issn=0021-9584}}</ref>&nbsp;These results suggest that additives serve to enhance geyser heights not by decreasing surface tension, but rather by decreasing bubble coalescence.

According to ''MythBusters'', the surface of the mint Mentos is covered with many small holes that increase the [[surface area]] available for reaction (and thus the quantity of reagents exposed to each other at any given time), thereby allowing CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles to form with the rapidity and quantity necessary for the \"jet\"-, \"geyser\"-, or \"eruption\"-like nature of the effusion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mythbusters: Diet Coke and Mentos MiniMyth|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/mythbusters-diet-coke-and-mentos.html|publisher=[[Discovery Channel]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502042917/http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/mythbusters-diet-coke-and-mentos.html|archivedate=2 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThis [[hypothesis]] gained further support when [[rock salt]] was used as a \"jump start\" to the reaction.

The term ''mucilage'' describes a group of clear, colorless, gelling agents derived from plants. The mucilage obtained from psyllium comes from the seed coat. Mucilage is obtained by mechanical milling (i.e. grinding) of the outer layer of the seed. Mucilage yield amounts to about 25% (by weight) of the total seed yield. Plantago-seed mucilage is often referred to as [[husk]], or psyllium husk. The milled seed mucilage is a white fibrous material that is [[hydrophilic]], meaning that its molecular structure causes it to attract and bind to water.

of action==\nThe soluble fiber in psyllium is the [[polysaccharide]] [[Xylan|heteroxylan]], a [[hemicellulose]].<ref>Fischer MH, Yu N, Gray GR, Ralph J, Anderson L, Marlett JA. (2004) The gel-forming polysaccharide of psyllium husk (Plantago ovata Forsk). Carbohydr Res. 2004 Aug 2;339(11):2009\u201317.</ref>\n\nPsyllium is produced mainly for its [[mucilage]] content. The term ''mucilage'' describes a group of clear, colorless, gelling agents derived from plants. The mucilage obtained from psyllium comes from the seed coat. Mucilage is obtained by mechanical milling (i.e. grinding) of the outer layer of the seed. Mucilage yield amounts to about 25% (by weight) of the total seed yield. Plantago-seed mucilage is often referred to as [[husk]], or psyllium husk. The milled seed mucilage is a white fibrous material that is [[hydrophilic]], meaning that its molecular structure causes it to attract and bind to water. Upon absorbing water, the clear, colorless, mucilaginous gel that forms increases in volume by tenfold or more.\n\n==Cultivation==\nThe genus ''Plantago'' contains over 200 species. ''[[Plantago ovata|P. ovata]]'' and ''P. psyllium'' are produced commercially in several European countries, the former Soviet Union and [[India]]. Plantago seed, known commercially as black, French, or Spanish psyllium, is obtained from ''P. psyllium'', also known as ''P. arenaria''. Seed produced from ''P. ovata'' is known in trading circles as white or blonde psyllium, Indian plantago, or isabgol. Isabgol is the common name in India for ''P. ovata''. it is known as ''Aspaghol'' in [[Pakistan]], coming from the [[Persian language|Persian]] {{transl|fa|asp}} and {{transl|fa|gul}}, meaning \"horse flower\", which is descriptive of the shape of the seed. India dominates the world market in the production and export of psyllium.\n\n''Plantago ovata'' is an annual herb that grows to a height of {{convert|30|-|46|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Leaves are opposite, linear or linear [[lanceolate]] {{convert|1|x|19|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The root system has a well-developed tap root with few fibrous secondary roots. A large number of flowering shoots arise from the base of the plant. Flowers are numerous, small, and white. Plants flower about 60 days after planting. The seeds are enclosed in capsules that open at maturity.\n\nThe fields are generally irrigated prior to seeding to achieve ideal soil moisture, to enhance seed soil contact, and to avoid burying the seed too deeply as a result of later irrigations or rainfall. Maximum germination occurs at a seeding depth of 6&nbsp;mm (1/4 in). Emerging seedlings are frost sensitive; therefore, planting should be delayed until conditions are expected to remain frost free. Seed is broadcast at 5.5 to 8.25&nbsp;kg/hectare (5 to 7.5&nbsp;lb/acre) in India. In Arizonan trials, seeding rates of 22 to 27.5&nbsp;kg/ha (20 to 25&nbsp;lb/acre) resulted in stands of 1 plant/25mm (1&nbsp;inch) in 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;inch) rows produced excellent yields. Weed control is normally achieved by one or two hand weedings early in the growing season. Control of weeds by pre-plant irrigation that germinates weed seeds followed by shallow [[tillage]] may be effective on fields with minimal weed pressure. Psyllium is a poor competitor with most weed species.\n\nPlantago wilt (''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]'') and [[downy mildew]] (''Peronospora alta'') are the major diseases of Isabgol. [[White grub]]s and [[aphid]]s are the major insect pests.\n\nThe flower spikes turn reddish brown at ripening, the lower leaves dry and the upper leaves yellow. The crop is harvested in the morning after the dew is gone to minimize shattering and field losses. In India, mature plants are cut 15&nbsp;cm above the ground and then bound, left for a few days to dry, thrashed, and [[winnowed]].\n\nHarvested seed must be dried to below 12% moisture to allow for cleaning, milling, and storage. Seed stored for future crops has shown a significant loss in viability after 2 years in storage.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Psyllium}}\n* [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=PLOV USDA Plants Profile: ''Plantago ovata'' Forsk.]\n* [https://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?28790 USDA Germplasm Resources Information Network: ''Plantago ovata'' Forsk.]\n* [https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=504438 ITIS Standard Report: ''Plantago ovata'' Forsk.]\n* [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-psyllium.html National Institute of Health (NIH) Medline Plus: ''Psyllium (Plantago ovata, Plantago isphagula)'']\n* [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=PLPS USDA Plants Profile: ''Plantago psyllium'' L.]\n* [https://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?316476 USDA Germplasm Resources Information Network: ''Plantago psyllium'' L.

However he was overlooked in the 2011 AFL National Draft. He then played for the Burnie Dockers, and was part of their 2012 Tasmanian State League (TSL) flag, kicking a goal in the grand final<ref>https://www.tasmanianstateleague.com.au/2012-season/</ref>. After this he made the move to Melbourne and started playing with Maribyrnong Park in the Essendon District Football League (EDFL) for the 2013 season in the hopes of securing a place in the VFL. Prior to the 2014 season he was offered a place at the Werribee VFL side.\n\n==VFL Career==\nIn 2014, Mihocek signed with VFL club Werribee for 2 seasons, but when Werribee became fully aligned with AFL side North Melbourne, Mihocek sought a move. He met with Port Melbourne coach Gary Ayres, and moved to Port Melbourne searching for team success.<ref>https://www.sen.com.au/news/2018/07/19/mature-magpie-mihocek-recalls-his-prolonged-passage-to-the-afl/</ref>. Mihocek played 33 games for Port Melbourne over 2 seasons, being awarded the Jack McFarlane medal for the club's Best & Fairest in 2016, and played a key role Port Melbourne's 2017 VFL Premiership, being impressive both in attack and defence during his tenure<ref>https://www.portmelbournefc.com.au/brody-mihocek-set-to-make-afl-debut-with-collingwood/</ref>. At the conclusion of the 2017 season, the AFL side Collingwood made the move to draft Mihocek.\n\n==AFL Career==\nMihocek plays as a tall marking forward who possesses considerable marking and goalkicking skills. However he occasionally floats up onto a wing and plays a link-up role to send the ball inside the forward 50. Perhaps the most notable facet of his game, his work ethic, is what sets him apart as he's constantly running, applying pressure and positioning himself in the forward half.\n\n===2018===\nCollingwood had been watching Mihocek closely in the VFL for a couple years, and decided to pick him with pick 22 in the 2018 Rookie Draft. While he played primarily as a defender in the VFL, he made his debut as a tall forward against Fremantle in round 11 2018 to immediate effect, kicking 4 goals. He found himself a regular in Collingwood's best 22, playing every remaining game in the season, including the finals series and the 2018 Grand Final loss against the West Coast Eagles where he kicked 1 goal. He finished the season with 29 goals from 16 games.\n\n===2019===\nOff the back of an impressive debut season Mihocek was a walk-up starter for Collingwood, arguably the most important person in their forward line with his marking prowess, running and work-ethic great assets. As Collingwood struggled with injuries and suspensions to a host of their forwards, Mihocek's importance to Collingwood was underlined, as he played every game for the season, and led Collingwood's goalkicking with 36 goals.

However he was overlooked in the 2011 AFL National Draft. He then played for the Burnie Dockers, and was part of their 2012 Tasmanian State League (TSL) flag, kicking a goal in the grand final<ref>https://www.tasmanianstateleague.com.au/2012-season/</ref>. After this he made the move to Melbourne and started playing with Maribyrnong Park in the Essendon District Football League (EDFL) for the 2013 season in the hopes of securing a place in the VFL. Prior to the 2014 season he was offered a place at the Werribee VFL side.\n\n==VFL Career==\nIn 2014, Mihocek signed with VFL club Werribee for 2 seasons, but when Werribee became fully aligned with AFL side North Melbourne, Mihocek sought a move. He met with Port Melbourne coach Gary Ayres, and moved to Port Melbourne searching for team success.<ref>https://www.sen.com.au/news/2018/07/19/mature-magpie-mihocek-recalls-his-prolonged-passage-to-the-afl/</ref>. Mihocek played 33 games for Port Melbourne over 2 seasons, being awarded the Jack McFarlane medal for the club's Best & Fairest in 2016, and played a key role Port Melbourne's 2017 VFL Premiership, being impressive both in attack and defence during his tenure<ref>https://www.portmelbournefc.com.au/brody-mihocek-set-to-make-afl-debut-with-collingwood/</ref>. At the conclusion of the 2017 season, the AFL side Collingwood made the move to draft Mihocek.\n\n==AFL Career==\nMihocek plays as a tall marking forward who possesses considerable marking and goalkicking skills. However he occasionally floats up onto a wing and plays a link-up role to send the ball inside the forward 50. Perhaps the most notable facet of his game, his work ethic, is what sets him apart as he's constantly running, applying pressure and positioning himself in the forward half.\n\n===2018===\nCollingwood had been watching Mihocek closely in the VFL for a couple years, and decided to pick him with pick 22 in the 2018 Rookie Draft. While he played primarily as a defender in the VFL, he made his debut as a tall forward against Fremantle in round 11 2018 to immediate effect, kicking 4 goals. He found himself a regular in Collingwood's best 22, playing every remaining game in the season, including the finals series and the 2018 Grand Final loss against the West Coast Eagles where he kicked 1 goal. He finished the season with 29 goals from 16 games.\n\n===2019===\nOff the back of an impressive debut season Mihocek was a walk-up starter for Collingwood, arguably the most important person in their forward line with his marking prowess, running and work-ethic great assests. As Collingwood struggled with injuries and suspensions to a host of their forwards, Mihocek's importance to Collingwood was underlined, as he played every game for the season, and led Collingwood's goalkicking with 36 goals. He also received 4 Brownlow Votes in 2019.\n\n==Statistics==\n:''Statistics are correct to the end of 2019 season''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/B/Brody_Mihocek.html|title=Brody Mihocek|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{AFL player statistics legend}}\n{{AFL player statistics start}}\n|- style=\"background-color: #eaeaea\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2018 AFL season|2018]]\n|{{AFL Col}}\n| 41 || 16 || 29 || 18 || 127 || 58 || 185 || 79 || 33 || 1.8 || 1.1 || 7.9 || 3.6 || 11.6 || 4.9 || 2.1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[2019 AFL season|2019]]\n|{{AFL Col}}\n| 41 || 24 || 36 || 26 || 213 || 102 || 315 || 141 || 49 || 1.5 || 1.1 || 8.9 || 4.2 || 13.1 || 5.9 || 2.0\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 40\n! 65\n! 44\n! 340\n! 160\n! 500\n! 220\n! 82\n! 1.6\n! 1.1\n! 8.5\n! 4\n! 12.5\n! 5.5\n! 2.1\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons cat}}\n*[http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/B/Brody_Mihocek.html Brody Mihocek] from AFL Tables\n\n{{Collingwood player squad}}\n{{Collingwood leading goalkickers}}\n{{2018 AFL rookie draft}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mihocek, Brody}}\n[[Category:Collingwood Football Club players]]\n[[Category:Australian rules footballers from Tasmania]]\n[[Category:Australian people of Croatian descent]]\n[[Category:Port Melbourne Football Club players]]\n[[Category:1993 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Werribee Football Club players]]\n[[Category:Burnie Dockers Football Club players]]\n", "name_user": "Lee Vilenski", "label": "safe", "comment": "assests->assets -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Mihocek"}
