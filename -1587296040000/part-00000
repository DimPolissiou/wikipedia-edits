The population was 11,163 at the 2010 census. The village is located in the town of [[Brookhaven, New York|Brookhaven]]. The village is officially known as the '''Incorporated Village of Lake Grove'''.\n\nLake Grove is a popular commercial area in Suffolk County, including stores and attractions such as the [[Smith Haven Mall]], [[Trader Joe's]], Whole Foods, and other large chain stores including DSW. Additional stores and attractions are located nearby in [[Nesconset, New York|Nesconset]], [[Stony Brook, New York|Stony Brook]] and [[Setauket-East Setauket, New York|South Setauket]].\n\nThe village features a number of different styles and prices of housing, including many well-maintained developments such as Crestwood Forest, Lake Grove Estates, Country Pointe, The Pines, Brittany Hills, and Country Woods.  The village also has a number of parks, recreational facilities, and a nature preserve for residents to enjoy.\n\nSome areas within the Lake Grove zip code, such as the Hathaway Oaks development and parts of the Brittany Hills development, are actually located in the unincorporated hamlet of [[Lake Ronkonkoma, New York|Lake Ronkonkoma]] within the towns of Brookhaven and [[Smithtown, New York|Smithtown]].\n\n==History==\nThe area of Lake Grove was settled in the early 18th century along [[New York State Route 25|Middle Country Road]], which was then part of the Old Kings Highway, originally a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] footpath. The community's first church building, built in 1818, was the [[First Congregational Church of New Village]]. Placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002, the building has been preserved and is depicted on the village seal. In 1870, Lake Grove established its first [[United States Postal Service|post office]], which carried the mail to and from [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Lakeland station]] (discontinued in 1883) by horse and wagon. The area was variously called Lakeland, Lakeville, New Village, Ronkonkoma or West Middle Island until it settled on the name Lake Grove in mid-19th century, after the groves of trees near Lake Ronkonkoma.\n\nDuring the early 20th century [[Lake Ronkonkoma]] became a popular area for recreation, which prompted many small summer houses built on private roads of Lake Grove. In 1921, a new post office was erected in the eastern part of the area and given the name of [[Centereach, New York|Centereach]]. The next significant housing development built in Lake Grove was called Brook Lawn and was located on Stony Brook Road, which later grew into [[Stony Brook, New York|Stony Brook]]. More developments followed and the population of Lake Grove increased rapidly. In 1954, newly built [[New York State Route 347|Nesconset Highway]] created a major commercial crossroad in Lake Grove, which prompted the construction of the [[Smith Haven Mall]] in 1968, which made the local residents become concerned about the impact of new businesses and increased traffic in their community. In order to gain local control of the zoning and planning, Lake Grove was incorporated by a vote of 552 to 332 on September 9, 1968.<ref>[http://www.lakegroveny.gov/about_the_village.htm About The Village] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211063210/http://www.lakegroveny.gov/about_the_village.htm |date=2009-12-11 }} - Official website.</ref><ref>[http://www.prudentialelliman.com/MainSite/Neighborhoods/NeighborhoodDetail.aspx?HCode=LAKGROVE About Lake Grove] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120909024921/http://www.prudentialelliman.com/MainSite/Neighborhoods/NeighborhoodDetail.aspx?HCode=LAKGROVE |date=2012-09-09 }} \u2014 Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate.</ref>\n\n==Mayors==\n* 1968\u20131981: Alex Pisciotta (1898\u20131985)<ref>[http://www.sunysb.edu/libspecial/collections/manuscripts/pisciotta.shtml Alex Pisciotta manuscript collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125224025/http://www.sunysb.edu/libspecial/collections/manuscripts/pisciotta.shtml |date=2008-01-25 }} \u2014 Stony Brook Special Collections & Archives</ref>\n* 1981\u20131995: Lillian Griffin (1939\u20132004)<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01EFDF1F30F935A15751C1A9629C8B63&sec=&spon= The Dearly Departed, Class of '04; Lillian Griffin \u2014 Safeguarding Lake Grove's Character] \u2014 ''[[The New York Times]]'', December&nbsp;26, 2004</ref>\n* 1995\u20132001: Robert J.

Placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002, the building has been preserved and is depicted on the village seal. In 1870, Lake Grove established its first [[United States Postal Service|post office]], which carried the mail to and from [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Lakeland station]] (discontinued in 1883) by horse and wagon. The area was variously called Lakeland, Lakeville, New Village, Ronkonkoma or West Middle Island until it settled on the name Lake Grove in mid-19th century, after the groves of trees near Lake Ronkonkoma.\n\nDuring the early 20th century [[Lake Ronkonkoma]] became a popular area for recreation, which prompted many small summer houses built on private roads of Lake Grove. In 1921, a new post office was erected in the eastern part of the area and given the name of [[Centereach, New York|Centereach]]. The next significant housing development built in Lake Grove was called Brook Lawn and was located on Stony Brook Road, which later grew into [[Stony Brook, New York|Stony Brook]]. More developments followed and the population of Lake Grove increased rapidly. In 1954, newly built [[New York State Route 347|Nesconset Highway]] created a major commercial crossroad in Lake Grove, which prompted the construction of the [[Smith Haven Mall]] in 1968, which made the local residents become concerned about the impact of new businesses and increased traffic in their community. In order to gain local control of the zoning and planning, Lake Grove was incorporated by a vote of 552 to 332 on September 9, 1968.<ref>[http://www.lakegroveny.gov/about_the_village.htm About The Village] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211063210/http://www.lakegroveny.gov/about_the_village.htm |date=2009-12-11 }} - Official website.</ref><ref>[http://www.prudentialelliman.com/MainSite/Neighborhoods/NeighborhoodDetail.aspx?HCode=LAKGROVE About Lake Grove] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120909024921/http://www.prudentialelliman.com/MainSite/Neighborhoods/NeighborhoodDetail.aspx?HCode=LAKGROVE |date=2012-09-09 }} \u2014 Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate.</ref>\n\n==Mayors==\n* 1968\u20131981: Alex Pisciotta (1898\u20131985)<ref>[http://www.sunysb.edu/libspecial/collections/manuscripts/pisciotta.shtml Alex Pisciotta manuscript collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125224025/http://www.sunysb.edu/libspecial/collections/manuscripts/pisciotta.shtml |date=2008-01-25 }} \u2014 Stony Brook Special Collections & Archives</ref>\n* 1981\u20131995: Lillian Griffin (1939\u20132004)<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01EFDF1F30F935A15751C1A9629C8B63&sec=&spon= The Dearly Departed, Class of '04; Lillian Griffin \u2014 Safeguarding Lake Grove's Character] \u2014 ''[[The New York Times]]'', December&nbsp;26, 2004</ref>\n* 1995\u20132001: Robert J.

The A6M was designated as the {{Nihongo| Mitsubishi '''Navy Type 0 carrier fighter''' |\u96f6\u5f0f\u8266\u4e0a\u6226\u95d8\u6a5f|rei-shiki-kanj\u014d-sent\u014dki}}, or the Mitsubishi A6M Rei-sen. The A6M was usually referred to by its pilots as the ''Reisen'' ({{nihongo2|\u96f6\u6226}}, zero fighter), \"0\" being the last digit of the [[Japanese calendar#Years|imperial year]] 2600 (1940) when it entered service with the Imperial Navy. The official [[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Allied reporting name]] was \"'''Zeke'''\", although the use of the name \"Zero\" (from Type 0) was used colloquially by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] as well.\n\nThe Zero is considered to have been the most capable [[carrier-based aircraft|carrier-based]] fighter in the world when it was introduced early in [[World War II]], combining excellent maneuverability and very long range.<ref name=\"Hawks\">Hawks, Chuck. [http://www.chuckhawks.com/best_fighter_planes.htm \"The Best Fighter Planes of World War II\"]. chuckhawks.com. Retrieved: 18 January 2007.</ref> The [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] (IJNAS) also frequently used it as a land-based fighter.\n\nIn early combat operations, the Zero gained a reputation as a [[dogfight]]er,<ref name=\"Young 2013 36\">Young 2013, p. 36.</ref> achieving an outstanding kill ratio of 12 to 1,<ref name= \"Thompson with Smith p. 231.\">Thompson with Smith 2008, p. 231.</ref> but by mid-1942 a combination of new tactics and the introduction of better equipment enabled Allied pilots to engage the Zero on generally equal terms.<ref>Mersky, Peter B.

Retrieved: 18 January 2007.</ref> By 1943, due to inherent design weaknesses, such as a lack of hydraulic ailerons and rudder rendering it extremely unmaneuverable at high speeds, and an inability to equip it with a more powerful [[aircraft engine]], the Zero gradually became less effective against newer Allied fighters. By 1944, with opposing Allied fighters approaching its levels of maneuverability and consistently exceeding its firepower, armor, and speed, the A6M had largely become outdated as a fighter aircraft. However, as design delays and production difficulties hampered the introduction of newer Japanese aircraft models, the Zero continued to serve in a front-line role until the end of the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|war in the Pacific]].  During the final phases, it was also adapted for use in ''[[kamikaze]]'' operations.<ref>Willmott 1980, pp. 40\u201341.</ref> Japan produced more Zeros than any other model of combat aircraft during the war.<ref name= \" Angelucci and Matricardi p. 138.\">Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 138.</ref>\n\n==Design and development==\n\nThe [[Mitsubishi A5M]] fighter was just entering service in early 1937, when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) started looking for its eventual replacement. On October 5, 1937, it issued \"Planning Requirements for the Prototype 12-shi Carrier-based Fighter\", sending it to [[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]] and [[Mitsubishi]].

Armament was to consist of two 20&nbsp;mm [[cannon]]s, two 7.7&nbsp;mm (.303&nbsp;in) [[machine gun]]s and two {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[bomb]]s. A complete radio set was to be mounted in all aircraft, along with a [[radio direction finder]] for long-range navigation.<ref name=\"Franc70p363-4\">Francillon 1970, pp. 363\u2013364.</ref> The maneuverability was to be at least equal to that of the A5M, while the wingspan had to be less than {{cvt|12|m|abbr=on}} to allow for use on aircraft carriers.\n\nNakajima's team considered the new requirements unachievable and pulled out of the competition in January. Mitsubishi's chief designer, [[Jiro Horikoshi]], thought that the requirements could be met, but only if the aircraft were made as light as possible. Every possible weight-saving measure was incorporated into the design. Most of the aircraft was built of a new top-secret aluminium alloy developed by [[Sumitomo Metal Industries]] in 1936. Called \"[[7075 aluminium alloy|extra super duralumin]]\" (ESD), it was lighter, stronger and more ductile than other alloys (e.g. 24S alloy) used at the time, but was prone to corrosive attack, which made it brittle.<ref>Yoshio, Baba.[https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jilm1951/39/5/39_5_378/_article/cited-by \"Extra super duralumin and successive aluminum alloys for aircraft.\"] ''Journal of Japan Institute of Light Metals (Sumitomo Light Metal Ind. Ltd., Japan),'' Volume 39, Issue 5, pp. 378\u2013395. Retrieved: 22 November 2015.</ref> This detrimental effect was countered with an [[Zinc chromate|anti-corrosion coating]] applied after fabrication. No armour protection was provided for the pilot, engine or other critical points of the aircraft, and [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s, which were becoming common at the time, were not used. This made the Zero lighter, more maneuverable, and the longest-ranged single-engine fighter of World War II, which made it capable of searching out an enemy hundreds of kilometres away, bringing it to battle, then returning to its base or aircraft carrier. However, that tradeoff in weight and construction also made it prone to catching fire and exploding when struck by enemy fire.<ref>Tillman 1979, pp. 5, 6, 96.</ref>\n\nWith its low-wing [[cantilever]] [[monoplane]] layout, retractable, wide-set [[conventional landing gear]] and enclosed cockpit, the Zero was one of the most modern carrier-based aircraft in the world at the time of its introduction. It had a fairly high-lift, low-speed wing with very low [[wing loading]]. This, combined with its light weight, resulted in a very low [[stall (flight)|stalling speed]] of well below {{convert|60|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}}. This was the main reason for its phenomenal maneuverability, allowing it to out-turn any Allied fighter of the time. Early models were fitted with [[servo tab]]s on the [[aileron]]s after pilots complained that control forces became too heavy at speeds above {{convert|300|km/h}}. They were discontinued on later models after it was found that the lightened control forces were causing pilots to overstress the wings during vigorous maneuvers.<ref>Yoshimura 1996, p. 108.</ref>\n\nIt has been claimed that the Zero's design showed a clear influence from British and American fighter aircraft and components exported to Japan in the 1930s, and in particular on the American side, the [[Vought V-141|Vought V-143]] fighter. [[Vought|Chance Vought]] had sold the prototype for this aircraft and its plans to Japan in 1937. Eugene Wilson, president of Vought, claimed that when shown a captured Zero in 1943, he found that \"There on the floor was the Vought V&nbsp;142 {{sic}} or just the spitting image of it, Japanese-made\", while the \"power-plant installation was distinctly Chance Vought, the wheel stowage into the wing roots came from Northrop, and the Japanese designers had even copied the Navy inspection stamp from Pratt & Whitney type parts.\"<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp107-108\">Fernandez 1983, pp. 107\u2013108.</ref> While the sale of the V-143 was fully legal,<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp107-108\"/><ref name=\"Angel p436\">Angelucci and Bowers 1987, p. 436.</ref> Wilson later acknowledged the conflicts of interest that can arise whenever military technology is exported.<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp107-108\"/> Counterclaims maintain that there was no significant relationship between the V-143 (which was an unsuccessful design that had been rejected by the U.S. Army Air Corps and several export customers) and the Zero, with only a superficial similarity in layout.\n\nThe Zero resembled the 1937 British [[Gloster F.5/34]]. Performance of the Gloster F.5/34 was comparable to that of early model Zeros, with its dimensions and appearance remarkably close to the Zero.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/docs/air/avzero.html#m6|title=The Mitsubishi A6M Zero (\"Zeke\")|author=|date=|website=www.faqs.org}}</ref> Gloster had a relationship with the Japanese between the wars, with Nakajima building the carrier-based plane, the [[Nakajima A1N|Gloster Gambet]], under license.<ref>James 1987, p. 159</ref> However allegations about the Zero being a copy have been discredited by some authors.<ref name=\"Angel p436\"/><ref name=\"AI Oct73p199-0\">''Air International'' October 1973, pp. 199\u2013200.</ref>\n\n===Name===\n{{see also|World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft}}\nThe A6M is usually known as the \"Zero\" from its Japanese Navy [[Type (designation)|type designation]], Type 0 carrier fighter (''Rei shiki Kanj\u014d sent\u014dki'', {{nihongo2|\u96f6\u5f0f\u8266\u4e0a\u6226\u95d8\u6a5f}}), taken from the last digit of the [[Japanese calendar#Years|Imperial year]] 2600 (1940) when it entered service. In Japan, it was unofficially referred to as both ''Rei-sen'' and ''Zero-sen''; Japanese pilots most commonly called it ''Zero-sen,'' where ''sen'' is the first syllable of ''sent\u014dki,'' Japanese for \"fighter plane\".{{#tag:ref|Note: In Japanese service carrier fighter units were referred to as ''Kanj\u014d sent\u014dkitai''.

McCoy of Nashville, Tennessee (assigned to the [[#Allied_Technical_Air_Intelligence_Unit_.28ATAIU.29|Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit (ATAIU)]] at [[Eagle Farm Airport]] in Australia), who wanted quick, distinctive, easy-to-remember names. The [[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Allied code for Japanese aircraft]] was introduced in 1942, and McCoy chose \"Zeke\" for the \"Zero\". Later, two variants of the fighter received their own code names. The [[Nakajima A6M2-N]] [[floatplane]] version of the Zero was called \"Rufe\", and the A6M3-32 variant was initially called \"Hap\". General [[Henry H.

If a Zero latched onto the tail of one of the fighters, the two aircraft would turn toward each other. If the Zero followed his original target through the turn, he would come into a position to be fired on by the target's wingman. This tactic was first used to good effect during the [[Battle of Midway]] and later over the [[Solomon Islands]].\n\nMany highly experienced Japanese aviators were lost in combat, resulting in a progressive decline in quality, which became a significant factor in Allied successes.

In this battle, the Japs dove in, made the attack and then immediately pulled out, taking advantage of their superior climb and maneuverability. In attacking fighters, the Zeros usually attacked from above rear at high speed and recovered by climbing vertically until they lost some speed and then pulled on through to complete a small loop of high wing over which placed them out of reach and in position for another attack.

The instrument panel was a \"marvel of simplicity&nbsp;... with no superfluities to distract [the pilot].\" What most impressed the experts was that the Zero's fuselage and wings were constructed in one piece, unlike the American method that built them separately and joined the two parts together.

It first flew on 1 April, and passed testing within a remarkably short period. By September, it had already been accepted for Navy testing as the A6M1 Type 0 Carrier Fighter, with the only notable change being a switch to a three-bladed propeller to cure a vibration problem.\n\n===A6M2a Type 0 Model 11===\n[[File:Zero_11_on_China.JPG|thumb|A Zero over China]]\nWhile the navy was testing the first two prototypes, they suggested that the third be fitted with the {{convert|700|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[Nakajima Sakae]] 12 engine instead. Mitsubishi had its own engine of this class in the form of the [[Mitsubishi Kinsei|Kinsei]], so they were somewhat reluctant to use the Sakae. Nevertheless, when the first A6M2 was completed in January 1940, the Sakae's extra power pushed the performance of the Zero well past the original specifications.\n\nThe new version was so promising that the Navy had 15 built and shipped to China before they had completed testing. They arrived in [[Manchuria]] in July 1940, and first saw combat over [[Chungking]] in August. There they proved to be completely untouchable by the [[Polikarpov I-16]]s and [[Polikarpov I-153|I-153]]s that had been such a problem for the A5Ms when in service. In one encounter, 13 Zeros shot down 27 I-15s and I-16s in under three minutes without loss. After hearing of these reports, the navy immediately ordered the A6M2 into production as the Type 0 Carrier Fighter, Model 11.\nReports of the Zero's performance filtered back to the US slowly. There they were dismissed by most military officials, who thought it was impossible for the Japanese to build such an aircraft.\n\n===A6M2b Type 0 Model 21===\n[[File:Carrier shokaku.jpg|thumb|A6M2 \"Zero\" Model 21 of ''[[Sh\u014dkaku]]'' prior to attack on Pearl Harbor, 7 December 1941.]] \nAfter the delivery of the 65th aircraft, a further change was worked into the production lines, which introduced folding wingtips to allow them to fit on [[aircraft carrier]]s.<ref name=\"Francillon 1979, p. 365\"/> The resulting Model 21 would become one of the most produced versions early in the war. A feature was the improved range with {{convert|520|l|USgal|abbr=on}} wing tank and {{convert|320|l|USgal|abbr=on}} drop tank. When the lines switched to updated models, 740 Model 21s had been completed by Mitsubishi, and another 800 by Nakajima. Two other versions of the Model 21 were built in small numbers, the Nakajima-built [[Nakajima A6M2-N|A6M2-N]] \"Rufe\" [[floatplane]] (based on the Model 11 with a slightly modified tail), and the A6M2-K two-seat trainer of which a total of 508 were built by Hitachi and the Sasebo Naval Air Arsenal.<ref name=\"Francillon,1979, p. 399\">Francillon 1979, p. 399.</ref>\n\n===A6M3 Type 0 Model 32===\n[[File:A6M3 Model32-common.jpg|thumb|A6M3 Model 32.]]\n\nIn 1941, Nakajima introduced the Sakae 21 engine, which used a two-speed [[supercharger]] for better altitude performance, and increased power to {{convert|840|kW|hp|abbr=on}}. A prototype Zero with the new engine was first flown on July 15, 1941.<ref name=\"Nohara 1993, p. 76\">Nohara 1993, p. 76.</ref>\n\nThe new Sakae was slightly heavier and somewhat longer due to the larger supercharger, which moved the [[center of gravity]] too far forward on the existing airframe. To correct for this, the engine mountings were cut back by {{cvt|185|mm}} to move the engine toward the cockpit. This had the side effect of reducing the size of the main fuselage fuel tank (located between the engine and the cockpit) from {{convert|518|l|USgal|abbr=on}} to {{convert|470|l|USgal|abbr=on}}. The cowling was redesigned to enlarge the cowl flaps, revise the oil cooler air intake, and move the carburetor air intake to the upper half of the cowling.<ref name=\"Nohara 1993, p. 51\">Nohara 1993, p. 51.</ref><ref>''Reisen no Tsuioku'' (Model Art 883), 2013, p.&nbsp;75.</ref>\n\nThe wings were redesigned to reduce span, eliminate the folding tips, and square off the wingtips. The inboard edge of the aileron was moved outboard by one rib, and the wing fuel tanks were enlarged accordingly to {{convert|420|l|USgal|abbr=on}}. The two 20&nbsp;mm wing cannon were upgraded from the [[Type 99 cannon|Type 99 Mark l]] to the [[Type 99 cannon|Type 99 Mark II]],<ref name=\"Nohara 1993, p. 51\"/> which required a bulge in the sheet metal of the wing below each cannon. The wings also included larger ammunition boxes and thus allowing 100 rounds per cannon.\n\nThe Sakae 21 engine and other changes increased maximum speed by only {{convert|11|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} compared to the Model 21, but sacrificed nearly {{convert|1000|km|miles|abbr=on}} of range.<ref name=\"Nohara 1993, p. 76\"/> Nevertheless, the navy accepted the type and it entered production in April 1942.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe shorter wing span led to better roll, and the reduced drag allowed the diving speed to be increased to {{convert|670|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. On the downside, turning and range, which were the strengths of the Model 21, suffered due to smaller ailerons, decreased lift and greater fuel consumption. The shorter range proved a significant limitation during the Solomons Campaign, during which Zeros based at Rabaul had to travel nearly to their maximum range to reach Guadalcanal and return.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Mechanic of World Aircraft'' Vol. 5, Koujinsha, 1994, pp. 220\u2013221.</ref> Consequently, the Model 32 was unsuited to that campaign<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Nohara 1993, pp. 76\u201377.</ref> and was used mainly for shorter range offensive missions and interception.\n\nThe appearance of the redesigned A6M3-32 prompted the US to assign the Model 32 a new code name, \"Hap\". This name was short-lived, as a protest from [[USAAF]] Commanding General [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry \"Hap\" Arnold]] forced a change to \"Hamp\". Soon after, it was realized that it was simply a new model of the \"Zeke\" and was termed \"Zeke 32\".\n\nThis variant was flown by only a small number of units, and only 343 were built.\n\n===A6M3 Type 0 Model 22===\n\nIn order to correct the deficiencies of the Model 32, a new version with folding wingtips and redesigned wing was introduced. The fuel tanks were moved to the outer wings, fuel lines for a {{convert|330|l|USgal|abbr=on}} drop tank were installed under each wing and the internal fuel capacity was increased to {{convert|570|l|USgal|abbr=on}}. More importantly, it regained its capabilities for long operating ranges, similar to the previous A6M2 Model 21, which was vastly shortened by the Model 32.\n\nHowever, before the new design type was accepted formally by the Navy, the A6M3 Model 22 already stood ready for service in December 1942. Approximately 560 aircraft of the new type had been produced in the meantime by Mitsubishi Jukogyo K.K.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Nohara 1993, p. 78.</ref>\n\nAccording to a theory, the very late production Model 22 might have had wings similar to the shortened, rounded-tip wing of the Model 52.<ref>Mikesh 1994. p. 90.</ref> One plane of such arrangement was photographed at [[Lakunai Airfield]] (\"Rabaul East\") in the second half of 1943, and has been published widely in a number of Japanese books. While the engine cowling is the same of previous Model 32 and 22, the theory proposes that the plane is an early production Model 52.<ref>Famous Airplanes of the World 9, 1993 p. 33.</ref> \n\nThe Model 32, 22, 22 kou, 52, 52 kou and 52 otsu were all powered by the Nakajima {{nihongo2|\u6804}} (''Sakae'') {{nihongo2|21\u578b}} engine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> That engine kept its designation in spite of changes in the exhaust system for the Model 52.\n\n===A6M4 Type 0 Model 41/42===\nMitsubishi is unable to state with certainty that it ever used the designation \"A6M4\" or model numbers for it. However, \"A6M4\" does appear in a translation of a captured Japanese memo from a Naval Air Technical Arsenal, titled Quarterly Report on Research Experiments, dated 1 October 1942.<ref name=\"CINPAC 14\"/> It mentions a \"cross-section of the A6M4 intercooler\" then being designed. Some researchers believe \"A6M4\" was applied to one or two prototype planes fitted with an experimental turbo-supercharged Sakae engine designed for high altitude.<ref>Mikesh 1981, p. 32.</ref> Mitsubishi's involvement in the project was probably quite limited or nil; the unmodified Sakae engine was made by Nakajima.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The design and testing of the turbo-supercharger was the responsibility of the First Naval Air [Technical] Arsenal ({{lang|ja|\u7b2c\u4e00\u6d77\u8ecd\u822a\u7a7a\u5ee0}}, ''{{transl|ja|Dai Ichi Kaigun K\u014dk\u016bsh\u014d}}'') at Yokosuka.<ref name=\"CINPAC 14\">\"Quarterly Report on Research Experiments\", Vol. 1, 30 March 1945. ''CINCPAC-CINCPOA Bulletin'', Special Translation No. 52, No. 67\u201345, p. 14 D.</ref> At least one photo of a prototype plane exists. It shows a turbo unit mounted in the forward left fuselage.\n\nLack of suitable alloys for use in the manufacture of a turbo-supercharger and its related ducting caused numerous ruptures, resulting in fires and poor performance. Consequently, further development of a turbo-supercharged A6M was cancelled. The lack of acceptance by the navy suggests that the navy did not bestow model number 41 or 42 formally, although it appears that the arsenal did use the designation \"A6M4\". The prototype engines nevertheless provided useful experience for future engine designs.<ref>[http://www.j-aircraft.com/a6mresearch/a6m4.htm \"A6M4\".] ''J-Aircraft.com''.

As a result, some are referred to by conflicting manufacturer serial numbers. In other cases, such as those recovered after decades in a wrecked condition, they have been reconstructed to the point that the majority of their structure is made up of modern parts. All of this means the identities of survivors can be difficult to confirm.\n\nMost flying Zeros have had their engines replaced with [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830|similar American units]]. Only one, the [[Planes of Fame Museum]]'s A6M5, has the original Sakae engine.<ref>Seaman, Richard.

Retrieved: 13 October 2010.</ref>\n\nThe rarity of flyable Zeros accounts for the use of single-seat [[North American T-6 Texan]]s, with heavily modified fuselages and painted in Japanese markings, as substitutes for Zeros in the films ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'', ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'', and many other television and film depictions of the aircraft, such as ''[[Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)|Baa Baa Black Sheep]]'' (renamed ''Black Sheep Squadron'').

The A6M was designated as the {{Nihongo| Mitsubishi '''Navy Type 0 carrier fighter''' |\u96f6\u5f0f\u8266\u4e0a\u6226\u95d8\u6a5f|rei-shiki-kanj\u014d-sent\u014dki}}, or the Mitsubishi A6M Rei-sen. The A6M was usually referred to by its pilots as the ''Reisen'' ({{nihongo2|\u96f6\u6226}}, zero fighter), \"0\" being the last digit of the [[Japanese calendar#Years|imperial year]] 2600 (1940) when it entered service with the Imperial Navy.

By 1944, with opposing Allied fighters approaching its levels of maneuverability and consistently exceeding its firepower, armor, and speed, the A6M had largely become outdated as a fighter aircraft. However, as design delays and production difficulties hampered the introduction of newer Japanese aircraft models, the Zero continued to serve in a front-line role until the end of the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|war in the Pacific]].  During the final phases, it was also adapted for use in ''[[kamikaze]]'' operations.<ref>Willmott 1980, pp. 40\u201341.</ref> Japan produced more Zeros than any other model of combat aircraft during the war.<ref name= \" Angelucci and Matricardi p. 138.\">Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 138.</ref>\n\n==Design and development==\n\nThe [[Mitsubishi A5M]] fighter was just entering service in early 1937, when the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) started looking for its eventual replacement. On October 5, 1937, it issued \"Planning Requirements for the Prototype 12-shi Carrier-based Fighter\", sending it to [[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]] and [[Mitsubishi]]. Both firms started preliminary design work while they awaited more definitive requirements to be handed over in a few months.<ref>{{Cite book|title=F4F Wildcat vs A6M Zero-Sen: Pacific Theater 1942|last=Young|first=Edward M.|publisher=Osprey|year=2013|isbn=978-1-78096-322-8|location=Oxford, Great Britain|pages=18|quote=}}</ref>\n\nBased on the experiences of the A5M in China, the IJN sent out updated requirements in October calling for a speed of {{convert|270|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a climb to {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}} in 9.5 minutes. With [[drop tanks]], it wanted an endurance of two hours at normal power, or six to eight hours at economical cruising speed. Armament was to consist of two 20&nbsp;mm [[cannon]]s, two 7.7&nbsp;mm (.303&nbsp;in) [[machine gun]]s and two {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[bomb]]s. A complete radio set was to be mounted in all aircraft, along with a [[radio direction finder]] for long-range navigation.<ref name=\"Franc70p363-4\">Francillon 1970, pp. 363\u2013364.</ref> The maneuverability was to be at least equal to that of the A5M, while the wingspan had to be less than {{cvt|12|m|abbr=on}} to allow for use on aircraft carriers.\n\nNakajima's team considered the new requirements unachievable and pulled out of the competition in January. Mitsubishi's chief designer, [[Jiro Horikoshi]], thought that the requirements could be met, but only if the aircraft were made as light as possible. Every possible weight-saving measure was incorporated into the design. Most of the aircraft was built of a new top-secret aluminium alloy developed by [[Sumitomo Metal Industries]] in 1936. Called \"[[7075 aluminium alloy|extra super duralumin]]\" (ESD), it was lighter, stronger and more ductile than other alloys (e.g. 24S alloy) used at the time, but was prone to corrosive attack, which made it brittle.<ref>Yoshio, Baba.[https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jilm1951/39/5/39_5_378/_article/cited-by \"Extra super duralumin and successive aluminum alloys for aircraft.\"] ''Journal of Japan Institute of Light Metals (Sumitomo Light Metal Ind. Ltd., Japan),'' Volume 39, Issue 5, pp. 378\u2013395. Retrieved: 22 November 2015.</ref> This detrimental effect was countered with an [[Zinc chromate|anti-corrosion coating]] applied after fabrication. No armour protection was provided for the pilot, engine or other critical points of the aircraft, and [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s, which were becoming common at the time, were not used. This made the Zero lighter, more maneuverable, and the longest-ranged single-engine fighter of World War II, which made it capable of searching out an enemy hundreds of kilometres away, bringing it to battle, then returning to its base or aircraft carrier. However, that tradeoff in weight and construction also made it prone to catching fire and exploding when struck by enemy fire.<ref>Tillman 1979, pp. 5, 6, 96.</ref>\n\nWith its low-wing [[cantilever]] [[monoplane]] layout, retractable, wide-set [[conventional landing gear]] and enclosed cockpit, the Zero was one of the most modern carrier-based aircraft in the world at the time of its introduction. It had a fairly high-lift, low-speed wing with very low [[wing loading]]. This, combined with its light weight, resulted in a very low [[stall (flight)|stalling speed]] of well below {{convert|60|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}}. This was the main reason for its phenomenal maneuverability, allowing it to out-turn any Allied fighter of the time. Early models were fitted with [[servo tab]]s on the [[aileron]]s after pilots complained that control forces became too heavy at speeds above {{convert|300|km/h}}. They were discontinued on later models after it was found that the lightened control forces were causing pilots to overstress the wings during vigorous maneuvers.<ref>Yoshimura 1996, p. 108.</ref>\n\nIt has been claimed that the Zero's design showed a clear influence from British and American fighter aircraft and components exported to Japan in the 1930s, and in particular on the American side, the [[Vought V-141|Vought V-143]] fighter. [[Vought|Chance Vought]] had sold the prototype for this aircraft and its plans to Japan in 1937. Eugene Wilson, president of Vought, claimed that when shown a captured Zero in 1943, he found that \"There on the floor was the Vought V&nbsp;142 {{sic}} or just the spitting image of it, Japanese-made\", while the \"power-plant installation was distinctly Chance Vought, the wheel stowage into the wing roots came from Northrop, and the Japanese designers had even copied the Navy inspection stamp from Pratt & Whitney type parts.\"<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp107-108\">Fernandez 1983, pp. 107\u2013108.</ref> While the sale of the V-143 was fully legal,<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp107-108\"/><ref name=\"Angel p436\">Angelucci and Bowers 1987, p. 436.</ref> Wilson later acknowledged the conflicts of interest that can arise whenever military technology is exported.<ref name=\"Fernandez1983pp107-108\"/> Counterclaims maintain that there was no significant relationship between the V-143 (which was an unsuccessful design that had been rejected by the U.S. Army Air Corps and several export customers) and the Zero, with only a superficial similarity in layout.\n\nThe Zero resembled the 1937 British [[Gloster F.5/34]]. Performance of the Gloster F.5/34 was comparable to that of early model Zeros, with its dimensions and appearance remarkably close to the Zero.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/docs/air/avzero.html#m6|title=The Mitsubishi A6M Zero (\"Zeke\")|author=|date=|website=www.faqs.org}}</ref> Gloster had a relationship with the Japanese between the wars, with Nakajima building the carrier-based plane, the [[Nakajima A1N|Gloster Gambet]], under license.<ref>James 1987, p. 159</ref> However allegations about the Zero being a copy have been discredited by some authors.<ref name=\"Angel p436\"/><ref name=\"AI Oct73p199-0\">''Air International'' October 1973, pp. 199\u2013200.</ref>\n\n===Name===\n{{see also|World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft}}\nThe A6M is usually known as the \"Zero\" from its Japanese Navy [[Type (designation)|type designation]], Type 0 carrier fighter (''Rei shiki Kanj\u014d sent\u014dki'', {{nihongo2|\u96f6\u5f0f\u8266\u4e0a\u6226\u95d8\u6a5f}}), taken from the last digit of the [[Japanese calendar#Years|Imperial year]] 2600 (1940) when it entered service. In Japan, it was unofficially referred to as both ''Rei-sen'' and ''Zero-sen''; Japanese pilots most commonly called it ''Zero-sen,'' where ''sen'' is the first syllable of ''sent\u014dki,'' Japanese for \"fighter plane\".{{#tag:ref|Note: In Japanese service carrier fighter units were referred to as ''Kanj\u014d sent\u014dkitai''.

McCoy of Nashville, Tennessee (assigned to the [[#Allied_Technical_Air_Intelligence_Unit_.28ATAIU.29|Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit (ATAIU)]] at [[Eagle Farm Airport]] in Australia), who wanted quick, distinctive, easy-to-remember names. The [[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Allied code for Japanese aircraft]] was introduced in 1942, and McCoy chose \"Zeke\" for the \"Zero\". Later, two variants of the fighter received their own code names. The [[Nakajima A6M2-N]] [[floatplane]] version of the Zero was called \"Rufe\", and the A6M3-32 variant was initially called \"Hap\". General [[Henry H.

If a Zero latched onto the tail of one of the fighters, the two aircraft would turn toward each other. If the Zero followed his original target through the turn, he would come into a position to be fired on by the target's wingman. This tactic was first used to good effect during the [[Battle of Midway]] and later over the [[Solomon Islands]].\n\nMany highly experienced Japanese aviators were lost in combat, resulting in a progressive decline in quality, which became a significant factor in Allied successes.

Mitsubishi had its own engine of this class in the form of the [[Mitsubishi Kinsei|Kinsei]], so they were somewhat reluctant to use the Sakae. Nevertheless, when the first A6M2 was completed in January 1940, the Sakae's extra power pushed the performance of the Zero well past the original specifications.\n\nThe new version was so promising that the Navy had 15 built and shipped to China before they had completed testing. They arrived in [[Manchuria]] in July 1940, and first saw combat over [[Chungking]] in August. There they proved to be completely untouchable by the [[Polikarpov I-16]]s and [[Polikarpov I-153|I-153]]s that had been such a problem for the A5Ms when in service. In one encounter, 13 Zeros shot down 27 I-15s and I-16s in under three minutes without loss. After hearing of these reports, the navy immediately ordered the A6M2 into production as the Type 0 Carrier Fighter, Model 11.\nReports of the Zero's performance filtered back to the US slowly.

This had the side effect of reducing the size of the main fuselage fuel tank (located between the engine and the cockpit) from {{convert|518|l|USgal|abbr=on}} to {{convert|470|l|USgal|abbr=on}}. The cowling was redesigned to enlarge the cowl flaps, revise the oil cooler air intake, and move the carburetor air intake to the upper half of the cowling.<ref name=\"Nohara 1993, p. 51\">Nohara 1993, p. 51.</ref><ref>''Reisen no Tsuioku'' (Model Art 883), 2013, p.&nbsp;75.</ref>\n\nThe wings were redesigned to reduce span, eliminate the folding tips, and square off the wingtips. The inboard edge of the aileron was moved outboard by one rib, and the wing fuel tanks were enlarged accordingly to {{convert|420|l|USgal|abbr=on}}. The two 20&nbsp;mm wing cannon were upgraded from the [[Type 99 cannon|Type 99 Mark l]] to the [[Type 99 cannon|Type 99 Mark II]],<ref name=\"Nohara 1993, p. 51\"/> which required a bulge in the sheet metal of the wing below each cannon. The wings also included larger ammunition boxes and thus allowing 100 rounds per cannon.\n\nThe Sakae 21 engine and other changes increased maximum speed by only {{convert|11|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} compared to the Model 21, but sacrificed nearly {{convert|1000|km|miles|abbr=on}} of range.<ref name=\"Nohara 1993, p. 76\"/> Nevertheless, the navy accepted the type and it entered production in April 1942.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe shorter wing span led to better roll, and the reduced drag allowed the diving speed to be increased to {{convert|670|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. On the downside, turning and range, which were the strengths of the Model 21, suffered due to smaller ailerons, decreased lift and greater fuel consumption. The shorter range proved a significant limitation during the Solomons Campaign, during which Zeros based at Rabaul had to travel nearly to their maximum range to reach Guadalcanal and return.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Mechanic of World Aircraft'' Vol. 5, Koujinsha, 1994, pp. 220\u2013221.</ref> Consequently, the Model 32 was unsuited to that campaign<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Nohara 1993, pp. 76\u201377.</ref> and was used mainly for shorter range offensive missions and interception.\n\nThe appearance of the redesigned A6M3-32 prompted the US to assign the Model 32 a new code name, \"Hap\". This name was short-lived, as a protest from [[USAAF]] Commanding General [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry \"Hap\" Arnold]] forced a change to \"Hamp\". Soon after, it was realized that it was simply a new model of the \"Zeke\" and was termed \"Zeke 32\".\n\nThis variant was flown by only a small number of units, and only 343 were built.\n\n===A6M3 Type 0 Model 22===\n\nIn order to correct the deficiencies of the Model 32, a new version with folding wingtips and redesigned wing was introduced. The fuel tanks were moved to the outer wings, fuel lines for a {{convert|330|l|USgal|abbr=on}} drop tank were installed under each wing and the internal fuel capacity was increased to {{convert|570|l|USgal|abbr=on}}. More importantly, it regained its capabilities for long operating ranges, similar to the previous A6M2 Model 21, which was vastly shortened by the Model 32.\n\nHowever, before the new design type was accepted formally by the Navy, the A6M3 Model 22 already stood ready for service in December 1942. Approximately 560 aircraft of the new type had been produced in the meantime by Mitsubishi Jukogyo K.K.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Nohara 1993, p. 78.</ref>\n\nAccording to a theory, the very late production Model 22 might have had wings similar to the shortened, rounded-tip wing of the Model 52.<ref>Mikesh 1994. p. 90.</ref> One plane of such arrangement was photographed at [[Lakunai Airfield]] (\"Rabaul East\") in the second half of 1943, and has been published widely in a number of Japanese books. While the engine cowling is the same of previous Model 32 and 22, the theory proposes that the plane is an early production Model 52.<ref>Famous Airplanes of the World 9, 1993 p. 33.</ref> \n\nThe Model 32, 22, 22 kou, 52, 52 kou and 52 otsu were all powered by the Nakajima {{nihongo2|\u6804}} (''Sakae'') {{nihongo2|21\u578b}} engine.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> That engine kept its designation in spite of changes in the exhaust system for the Model 52.\n\n===A6M4 Type 0 Model 41/42===\nMitsubishi is unable to state with certainty that it ever used the designation \"A6M4\" or model numbers for it. However, \"A6M4\" does appear in a translation of a captured Japanese memo from a Naval Air Technical Arsenal, titled Quarterly Report on Research Experiments, dated 1 October 1942.<ref name=\"CINPAC 14\"/> It mentions a \"cross-section of the A6M4 intercooler\" then being designed. Some researchers believe \"A6M4\" was applied to one or two prototype planes fitted with an experimental turbo-supercharged Sakae engine designed for high altitude.<ref>Mikesh 1981, p. 32.</ref> Mitsubishi's involvement in the project was probably quite limited or nil; the unmodified Sakae engine was made by Nakajima.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The design and testing of the turbo-supercharger was the responsibility of the First Naval Air [Technical] Arsenal ({{lang|ja|\u7b2c\u4e00\u6d77\u8ecd\u822a\u7a7a\u5ee0}}, ''{{transl|ja|Dai Ichi Kaigun K\u014dk\u016bsh\u014d}}'') at Yokosuka.<ref name=\"CINPAC 14\">\"Quarterly Report on Research Experiments\", Vol. 1, 30 March 1945. ''CINCPAC-CINCPOA Bulletin'', Special Translation No. 52, No. 67\u201345, p. 14 D.</ref> At least one photo of a prototype plane exists. It shows a turbo unit mounted in the forward left fuselage.\n\nLack of suitable alloys for use in the manufacture of a turbo-supercharger and its related ducting caused numerous ruptures, resulting in fires and poor performance. Consequently, further development of a turbo-supercharged A6M was cancelled. The lack of acceptance by the navy suggests that the navy did not bestow model number 41 or 42 formally, although it appears that the arsenal did use the designation \"A6M4\". The prototype engines nevertheless provided useful experience for future engine designs.<ref>[http://www.j-aircraft.com/a6mresearch/a6m4.htm \"A6M4\".] ''J-Aircraft.com''.

As a result, some are referred to by conflicting manufacturer serial numbers. In other cases, such as those recovered after decades in a wrecked condition, they have been reconstructed to the point that the majority of their structure is made up of modern parts. All of this means the identities of survivors can be difficult to confirm.\n\nMost flying Zeros have had their engines replaced with [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830|similar American units]]. Only one, the [[Planes of Fame Museum]]'s A6M5, has the original Sakae engine.<ref>Seaman, Richard.

Retrieved: 13 October 2010.</ref>\n\nThe rarity of flyable Zeros accounts for the use of single-seat [[North American T-6 Texan]]s, with heavily modified fuselages and painted in Japanese markings, as substitutes for Zeros in the films ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'', ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'', and many other television and film depictions of the aircraft, such as ''[[Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)|Baa Baa Black Sheep]]'' (renamed ''Black Sheep Squadron'').

If this is correct, it is most likely one of the 123 aircraft lost by the Japanese during the assault of Rabaul.

{"title_page": "Chewing tobacco", "text_new": "[[File:Tuggtobak.jpg|thumb|right|American [[Red Man]] loose leaf and Danish [[Oliver Twist Tobacco|Oliver Twist]] tobacco bits are two leading chewing tobacco brands.]]\n\n'''Chewing tobacco''' is a type of [[smokeless tobacco]] [[tobacco product|product]] consumed by placing a portion of the tobacco between the cheek and gum or upper lip teeth and chewing. Unlike [[dipping tobacco]], it is not ground and must be manually crushed with the teeth to release flavour and [[nicotine]]. Unwanted juices are then spat.\n\nChewing tobacco is typically manufactured as several varieties of product \u2013 most often as loose leaf (or scrap), pellets (tobacco \"bites\" or \"bits\"), and \"plug\" (a form of loose leaf tobacco condensed with a binding sweetener). Nearly all modern chewing tobaccos are produced via a process of leaf curing, cutting, fermentation and processing or sweetening. Historically, a lot of American chewing tobacco brands (which were popular during the [[American Civil War]] era) were made with [[cigar]] clippings.\n\n==Health issues==\nOral and spit tobacco increase the risk for [[leukoplakia]], a precursor to [[oral cancer]].<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_3X_What_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_cancer.asp ''Detailed Guide: Cancer (General Information) Signs and Symptoms of Cancer''].</ref> Chewing tobacco has been known to cause [[cancer]], particularly of the mouth and throat.<ref name=\"IARC\" /> According to [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], \"Some health scientists have suggested that smokeless tobacco should be used in smoking cessation programs and have made implicit or explicit claims that its use would partly reduce the exposure of smokers to carcinogens and the risk for cancer. These claims, however, are not supported by the available evidence.\"<ref name=\"IARC\">{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=Smokeless Tobacco and Some Tobacco-specific N-Nitrosamines |journal=IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans |volume=87 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/iarcmono89/pdf/}} </ref>\n\n== History ==\nChewing is one of the oldest methods of consuming tobacco. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] in both North and South America chewed the leaves of the plant long before the arrival of Europeans, frequently mixed with the mineral [[Lime (mineral)|lime]], in the same way as [[coca]] leaves.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe southern United States was distinctive for its production of tobacco, which earned premium prices from around the world. Most farmers grew a little for their own use, or traded with neighbours who grew it. Commercial sales became important in the late 19th century as major tobacco companies rose in the South, becoming one of the largest employers in cities like [[Winston-Salem, NC]], [[Durham, NC]], and [[Richmond, VA]]. Southerners dominated the tobacco industry in the United States; even a concern as large as the [[Bloch Brothers Tobacco Company|Helme Tobacco Company]], headquartered in [[New Jersey]], was headed by former Confederate officer [[George Washington Helme]]. In 1938, [[R.J. Reynolds]] marketed eighty-four brands of chewing tobacco, twelve brands of smoking tobacco, and the top-selling [[Camel cigarettes|Camel brand of cigarettes]]. Reynolds sold large quantities of chewing tobacco, though that market peaked about 1910.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalink.org/tobacco/trg/Chapter17/Chap17_SmokelessPage5.html|title=globalink|accessdate=30 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926020900/http://www.globalink.org/tobacco/trg/Chapter17/Chap17_SmokelessPage5.html|archivedate=26 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nA historian of the American South in the late 1860s reported on typical usage in the region where it was grown, paying close attention to class and gender:<ref>''A History of the United States since the Civil War'' Volume: 1. by [[Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer]]; 1917. p. 93.</ref>\n{{bquote|The chewing of tobacco was well-nigh universal. This habit had been widespread among the agricultural population of America both North and South before the war. Soldiers had found the quid a solace in the field and continued to revolve it in their mouths upon returning to their homes. Out of doors where his life was principally led the chewer spat upon his lands without offence to other men, and his homes and public buildings were supplied with spittoons. Brown and yellow parabolas were projected to right and left toward these receivers, but very often without the careful aim which made for cleanly living. Even the pews of fashionable churches were likely to contain these familiar conveniences. The large numbers of Southern men, and these were of the better class (officers in the Confederate army and planters, worth $20,000 or more, and barred from general amnesty) who presented themselves for the pardon of President Johnson, while they sat awaiting his pleasure in the ante-room at the White House, covered its floor with pools and rivulets of their spittle. An observant traveller in the South in 1865 said that in his belief seven-tenths of all persons above the age of twelve years, both male and female, used tobacco in some form. Women could be seen at the doors of their cabins in their bare feet, in their dirty one-piece cotton garments, their chairs tipped back, smoking pipes made of corn cobs into which were fitted reed stems or goose quills. Boys of eight or nine years of age and half-grown girls smoked. Women and girls \"dipped\" in their houses, on their porches, in the public parlours of hotels and in the streets.}}\n\nChewing tobacco is still used, predominantly by young males in some parts of the American Southeast, but also in other areas and age groups. In September 2006 both the Republican and Democratic candidates for Senator from Virginia admitted to chewing tobacco and agreed that it sets a bad example for children.<ref>[https://archive.today/20070811044721/http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=111171&ran=197946 home.hamptonroads.com]</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, during the peak in popularity of chewing tobacco in the western United States, a device known as the [[spittoon]] was a ubiquitous feature throughout places both private and public (e.g. [[parlour]]s and [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]]). The purpose of the spittoon was to provide a receptacle for excess juices and spittle accumulated from the oral use of tobacco. As chewing tobacco's popularity declined throughout the years, the spittoon became merely a relic of the Old West and is rarely seen outside museums. Spittoons are still present on the floor of the [[U.S. Senate]]'s old chamber, honored as tradition.\n\n==Types==\nChewing tobacco comes in several different varieties.\n\n===Loose leaf===\nLoose leaf chewing tobacco is the most widely available and most frequently used type of chewing tobacco.  It consists of shredded tobacco leaf, usually sweetened and sometimes flavored, and often sold in a sealed pouch weighing on average 3oz.  Loose leaf chewing tobacco has a sticky texture due to the sweeteners added.  Common loose leaf chewing tobaccos include [[Red Man]], [[Levi Garrett]], Beechnut, and Stoker's.\n\n===Plug===\n[[File:Plug Chewing Tobaccos.JPG|thumb|200px|A selection of plug chewing tobaccos from the United States.]]\nPlug chewing tobacco is pressed tobacco leaves into a square, brick-like mass of tobacco called a plug.  From this, pieces are bitten off or cut from the plug and then chewed.  Plug tobacco is declining in popularity and is thus less readily available than loose leaf chewing tobacco. Historically, plug tobacco could be either smoked in a pipe or chewed, but today these are two distinct products.\n\n===Twist===\nTwist chewing tobacco is a rope-like piece of tobacco twisted together.  Unlike most loose leaf tobaccos, twist chewing tobacco is usually not sweetened.  Pieces of twist are either bitten off or cut and then chewed. Twist chewing tobacco is not widely available and is mostly found in [[Appalachia]].  Historically, twists could also be smoked in a pipe, or ground up into nasal [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pipesmagazine.com/python/tag/how-to-smoke-rope-twist-tobacco/|title=How To Smoke Rope & Twist Tobacco \u2013 With Pipe and Pen|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Chew bags===\nChew bags are traditional cut tobacco in a small bag containing between 0.5 and 1 gram each. Chew bags are used in much the same way as other chewing tobaccos although they have the appearance of snus portions. Chew bags are defined by European Commission, European Binding Tariff Information (EBTI) as cut or fine cut tobacco flakes (between 1-2 mm wide and 2-6 mm long) packed in sachets. By varying the sachet between the upper lip and by chewing, the consumer controls the release of flavor or nicotine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chadizzy1.blogspot.se/2017/01/general-cut-original-extra-strong-chew.html|title=General Cut (Original & Extra Strong) Chew Bags - Review.  20 January 2017.|author=|date=|website=chadizzy1.blogspot.se|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/ebti/ebti_details.jsp?Lang=en&selectedReference=&reference=SE2015-00330&refcountry=&valstartdate=&valstartdateto=&valenddate=&valenddateto=&suppldate=&nomenc=2403991000&nomencto=&keywordsearch=&descript=&orderby=0&totalRecords=17&linkVal=&viewVal=&keywordmatchrule=OR&specialkeyword|title=BTI Details|author=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Chewing tobacco and baseball==\nWhen the rules of baseball were first written in 1845, the carcinogenic potential of chewing tobacco was unknown. At that time, it was commonly used by players and coaches alike.<ref>Bird, Patrick J.. \"Chewing Tobacco the Spitting Image of Baseball\". Ocala Star-Banner April 11, 1989: 7C.</ref> Smokeless tobacco use became rampant by players by the early 1900s.

Today, however, more baseball players are actually using dipping tobacco, not chewing tobacco.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Notable players affected by chewing tobacco===\nAs shown below, a number of notable players have died of oral cancer as a result. [[Joe Garagiola]], who quit, warns about chewing tobacco: \n{{quote|\"I tell these guys, 'You may not like what I say, but with lung cancer you die of lung cancer,{{'\"}} ... \"With oral cancer, you die one piece at a time.

Tuttle was an outfielder for the [[Detroit Tigers]], [[Kansas City Athletics]], and the [[Minnesota Twins]]. He was an avid tobacco chewer; even his [[baseball card]]s pictured him with a bulge in his cheek from the tobacco. Nearly forty years after he began using smokeless tobacco, Tuttle developed a tumor in his mouth so severe it protruded through his skin. A few years before he died, Tuttle had many of his teeth, his jawbone, his gums, and his right cheekbone removed. He also had his taste buds removed.<ref>\"Smokeless Tobacco\".

He also dedicated time to the National Spit Tobacco Education Program, which was being run by friend and former Major League player, Joe Garagiola.

Unlike [[dipping tobacco]], it is not ground and must be manually crushed with the teeth to release flavour and [[nicotine]]. Unwanted juices are then expectorated (spat).\n\nChewing tobacco is typically manufactured as several varieties of product \u2013 most often as loose leaf (or scrap), pellets (tobacco \"bites\" or \"bits\"), and \"plug\" (a form of loose leaf tobacco condensed with a binding sweetener). Nearly all modern chewing tobaccos are produced via a process of leaf curing, cutting, fermentation and processing or sweetening. Historically, a lot of American chewing tobacco brands (which were popular during the [[American Civil War]] era) were made with [[cigar]] clippings.\n\n==Health issues==\nOral and spit tobacco increase the risk for [[leukoplakia]], a precursor to [[oral cancer]].<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_3X_What_are_the_signs_and_symptoms_of_cancer.asp ''Detailed Guide: Cancer (General Information) Signs and Symptoms of Cancer''].</ref> Chewing tobacco has been known to cause [[cancer]], particularly of the mouth and throat.<ref name=\"IARC\" /> According to [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], \"Some health scientists have suggested that smokeless tobacco should be used in smoking cessation programs and have made implicit or explicit claims that its use would partly reduce the exposure of smokers to carcinogens and the risk for cancer.

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] in both North and South America chewed the leaves of the plant long before the arrival of Europeans, frequently mixed with the mineral [[Lime (mineral)|lime]], in the same way as [[coca]] leaves.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe southern United States was distinctive for its production of tobacco, which earned premium prices from around the world. Most farmers grew a little for their own use, or traded with neighbours who grew it. Commercial sales became important in the late 19th century as major tobacco companies rose in the South, becoming one of the largest employers in cities like [[Winston-Salem, NC]], [[Durham, NC]], and [[Richmond, VA]]. Southerners dominated the tobacco industry in the United States; even a concern as large as the [[Bloch Brothers Tobacco Company|Helme Tobacco Company]], headquartered in [[New Jersey]], was headed by former Confederate officer [[George Washington Helme]]. In 1938, [[R.J. Reynolds]] marketed eighty-four brands of chewing tobacco, twelve brands of smoking tobacco, and the top-selling [[Camel cigarettes|Camel brand of cigarettes]]. Reynolds sold large quantities of chewing tobacco, though that market peaked about 1910.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalink.org/tobacco/trg/Chapter17/Chap17_SmokelessPage5.html|title=globalink|accessdate=30 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926020900/http://www.globalink.org/tobacco/trg/Chapter17/Chap17_SmokelessPage5.html|archivedate=26 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nA historian of the American South in the late 1860s reported on typical usage in the region where it was grown, paying close attention to class and gender:<ref>''A History of the United States since the Civil War'' Volume: 1. by [[Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer]]; 1917. p. 93.</ref>\n{{bquote|The chewing of tobacco was well-nigh universal. This habit had been widespread among the agricultural population of America both North and South before the war. Soldiers had found the quid a solace in the field and continued to revolve it in their mouths upon returning to their homes. Out of doors where his life was principally led the chewer spat upon his lands without offence to other men, and his homes and public buildings were supplied with spittoons. Brown and yellow parabolas were projected to right and left toward these receivers, but very often without the careful aim which made for cleanly living. Even the pews of fashionable churches were likely to contain these familiar conveniences. The large numbers of Southern men, and these were of the better class (officers in the Confederate army and planters, worth $20,000 or more, and barred from general amnesty) who presented themselves for the pardon of President Johnson, while they sat awaiting his pleasure in the ante-room at the White House, covered its floor with pools and rivulets of their spittle. An observant traveller in the South in 1865 said that in his belief seven-tenths of all persons above the age of twelve years, both male and female, used tobacco in some form. Women could be seen at the doors of their cabins in their bare feet, in their dirty one-piece cotton garments, their chairs tipped back, smoking pipes made of corn cobs into which were fitted reed stems or goose quills. Boys of eight or nine years of age and half-grown girls smoked. Women and girls \"dipped\" in their houses, on their porches, in the public parlours of hotels and in the streets.}}\n\nChewing tobacco is still used, predominantly by young males in some parts of the American Southeast, but also in other areas and age groups. In September 2006 both the Republican and Democratic candidates for Senator from Virginia admitted to chewing tobacco and agreed that it sets a bad example for children.<ref>[https://archive.today/20070811044721/http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/story.cfm?story=111171&ran=197946 home.hamptonroads.com]</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, during the peak in popularity of chewing tobacco in the western United States, a device known as the [[spittoon]] was a ubiquitous feature throughout places both private and public (e.g. [[parlour]]s and [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]]). The purpose of the spittoon was to provide a receptacle for excess juices and spittle accumulated from the oral use of tobacco. As chewing tobacco's popularity declined throughout the years, the spittoon became merely a relic of the Old West and is rarely seen outside museums. Spittoons are still present on the floor of the [[U.S. Senate]]'s old chamber, honored as tradition.\n\n==Types==\nChewing tobacco comes in several different varieties.\n\n===Loose leaf===\nLoose leaf chewing tobacco is the most widely available and most frequently used type of chewing tobacco.  It consists of shredded tobacco leaf, usually sweetened and sometimes flavored, and often sold in a sealed pouch weighing on average 3oz.  Loose leaf chewing tobacco has a sticky texture due to the sweeteners added.  Common loose leaf chewing tobaccos include [[Red Man]], [[Levi Garrett]], Beechnut, and Stoker's.\n\n===Plug===\n[[File:Plug Chewing Tobaccos.JPG|thumb|200px|A selection of plug chewing tobaccos from the United States.]]\nPlug chewing tobacco is pressed tobacco leaves into a square, brick-like mass of tobacco called a plug.  From this, pieces are bitten off or cut from the plug and then chewed.  Plug tobacco is declining in popularity and is thus less readily available than loose leaf chewing tobacco. Historically, plug tobacco could be either smoked in a pipe or chewed, but today these are two distinct products.\n\n===Twist===\nTwist chewing tobacco is a rope-like piece of tobacco twisted together.  Unlike most loose leaf tobaccos, twist chewing tobacco is usually not sweetened.  Pieces of twist are either bitten off or cut and then chewed. Twist chewing tobacco is not widely available and is mostly found in [[Appalachia]].  Historically, twists could also be smoked in a pipe, or ground up into nasal [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pipesmagazine.com/python/tag/how-to-smoke-rope-twist-tobacco/|title=How To Smoke Rope & Twist Tobacco \u2013 With Pipe and Pen|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Chew bags===\nChew bags are traditional cut tobacco in a small bag containing between 0.5 and 1 gram each. Chew bags are used in much the same way as other chewing tobaccos although they have the appearance of snus portions. Chew bags are defined by European Commission, European Binding Tariff Information (EBTI) as cut or fine cut tobacco flakes (between 1-2 mm wide and 2-6 mm long) packed in sachets. By varying the sachet between the upper lip and by chewing, the consumer controls the release of flavor or nicotine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chadizzy1.blogspot.se/2017/01/general-cut-original-extra-strong-chew.html|title=General Cut (Original & Extra Strong) Chew Bags - Review.  20 January 2017.|author=|date=|website=chadizzy1.blogspot.se|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/ebti/ebti_details.jsp?Lang=en&selectedReference=&reference=SE2015-00330&refcountry=&valstartdate=&valstartdateto=&valenddate=&valenddateto=&suppldate=&nomenc=2403991000&nomencto=&keywordsearch=&descript=&orderby=0&totalRecords=17&linkVal=&viewVal=&keywordmatchrule=OR&specialkeyword|title=BTI Details|author=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Chewing tobacco and baseball==\nWhen the rules of baseball were first written in 1845, the carcinogenic potential of chewing tobacco was unknown. At that time, it was commonly used by players and coaches alike.<ref>Bird, Patrick J.. \"Chewing Tobacco the Spitting Image of Baseball\". Ocala Star-Banner April 11, 1989: 7C.</ref> Smokeless tobacco use became rampant by players by the early 1900s.

[http://www.slate.com/id/2234341/ \"Why Do So Many Baseball Players Chew Tobacco?\"]. Slate November 2, 2009.</ref> The use of chewing tobacco in baseball steadily increased until the mid-20th century, when cigarettes became popular and took the place of some players' smokeless tobacco habit.  Today, however, more baseball players are actually using dipping tobacco, not chewing tobacco.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Notable players affected by chewing tobacco===\nAs shown below, a number of notable players have died of oral cancer as a result. [[Joe Garagiola]], who quit, warns about chewing tobacco: \n{{quote|\"I tell these guys, 'You may not like what I say, but with lung cancer you die of lung cancer,{{'\"}} ... \"With oral cancer, you die one piece at a time.

Tuttle was an outfielder for the [[Detroit Tigers]], [[Kansas City Athletics]], and the [[Minnesota Twins]]. He was an avid tobacco chewer; even his [[baseball card]]s pictured him with a bulge in his cheek from the tobacco. Nearly forty years after he began using smokeless tobacco, Tuttle developed a tumor in his mouth so severe it protruded through his skin. A few years before he died, Tuttle had many of his teeth, his jawbone, his gums, and his right cheekbone removed. He also had his taste buds removed.<ref>\"Smokeless Tobacco\". [http://kidshealth.org/teen/drug_alcohol/tobacco/smokeless.html KidsHealth.org]. April 28, 2010.</ref> Tuttle dedicated the last years of his life to speaking with Major League teams about not using chewing tobacco where television cameras could see the players so that children could not witness and be influenced by it. He also dedicated time to the National Spit Tobacco Education Program, which was being run by friend and former Major League player, Joe Garagiola. Tuttle died July 27, 1998, after a five-year battle with cancer.<ref name=\"No-Smoking.org\">Goldstein, Richard. \"Big League Anti-Tobacco Advocate Dies\".

This is true especially among white and Hispanic males.<ref name=\"Smith10\"/> In 1970, five times as many 65-and-older males used smokeless tobacco as 18- to 24-year-olds did (12.7% of the population were 65+ male users, 2.2% of the population were 18\u201324 male users). More specifically, moist snuff use increased for males ages 18\u201324 from 1% of the population to 6.2% of the population, while 65+ male users decreased from 4% to 2.2%.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nA 2009 survey by The U.S. Center for Disease Control revealed that 8.9% of U.S. high school students had used smokeless tobacco on at least 1 day during the 30 days before the survey.<ref name=CDC2009/> Usage was more common among males (15.0%) than females (2.2%) and among whites (11.9%) than blacks (3.3%) or Hispanics (5.1%).

Some of these include determining whether the search term appears in the [[body text]] or [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of a [[web page]]. Many search engines check for instances of spamdexing and will remove suspect pages from their indexes. Also, search-engine operators can quickly block the results listing from entire websites that use spamdexing, perhaps in response to user complaints of false matches. The rise of spamdexing in the mid-1990s made the leading search engines of the time less useful. Using unethical methods to make websites rank higher in search engine results than they otherwise would is commonly referred to in the SEO (search engine optimization) industry as \"black-hat SEO\". These methods are more focused on breaking the search-engine-promotion rules and guidelines. In addition to this, the perpetrators run the risk of their websites being severely penalized by the [[Google Panda]] and [[Google Penguin]] search-results ranking algorithms.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ann |last=Smarty |title=What Is BlackHat SEO? 5 Definitions |url=http://www.searchenginejournal.com/what-is-blackhat-seo-5-definitions/8151/ |work=Search Engine Journal |date=2008-12-17 |accessdate=2012-07-05 }}</ref>\n\nCommon spamdexing techniques can be classified into two broad classes: ''content spam''<ref name=\"Ntoulas\"/> (or ''term spam'') and ''link spam''.<ref name=Gyongyi/>\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known reference<ref name=\"wspy\"/> to the term ''spamdexing'' is by Eric Convey in his article \"Porn sneaks way back on Web,\" [[The Boston Herald]], May 22, 1996, where he said:\n\n<blockquote>The problem arises when site operators load their Web pages with hundreds of extraneous terms so search engines will list them among legitimate addresses.\nThe process is called \"spamdexing,\" a combination of [[spamming]] \u2014 the Internet term for sending users unsolicited information \u2014 and \"[[Web indexing|indexing]].\"<ref name=wspy/></blockquote>\n\n==Content spam==\nThese techniques involve altering the logical view that a search engine has over the page's contents. They all aim at variants of the [[vector space model]] for information retrieval on text collections.\n\n===Keyword stuffing===\nKeyword stuffing involves the calculated placement of keywords within a page to raise the keyword count, variety, and density of the page. This is useful to make a page appear to be relevant for a [[web crawler]] in a way that makes it more likely to be found. Example: A promoter of a [[Ponzi scheme]] wants to attract web surfers to a site where he advertises his scam. He places hidden text appropriate for a fan page of a popular music group on his page, hoping that the page will be listed as a fan site and receive many visits from music lovers. Older versions of indexing programs simply counted how often a keyword appeared, and used that to determine relevance levels. Most modern search engines have the ability to analyze a page for keyword stuffing and determine whether the frequency is consistent with other sites created specifically to attract search engine traffic. Also, large webpages are truncated, so that massive dictionary lists cannot be indexed on a single webpage.{{cn|date=December 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/03/21/dangers-of-keyword-stuffing|title=The Dangers of SEO Keyword Stuffing|last=Megan|first=Marrs|date=2017|website=https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/03/21/dangers-of-keyword-stuffing|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=19/4/2020}}</ref> (However, spammers can circumvent this webpage-size limitation merely by setting up multiple webpages, either independently or linked to each other.)\n  \n=== Hidden or invisible text ===\nUnrelated [[hidden text]] is disguised by making it the same color as the background, using a tiny font size, or hiding it within [[HTML]] code such as \"no frame\" sections, [[alt attribute]]s, zero-sized [[Span and div|DIVs]], and \"no script\" sections. People manually screening red-flagged websites for a search-engine company might temporarily or permanently block an entire website for having invisible text on some of its pages. However, hidden text is not always spamdexing: it can also be used to enhance [[web accessibility|accessibility]].\n\n===Meta-tag stuffing===\nThis involves repeating keywords in the [[meta tag]]s, and using meta keywords that are unrelated to the site's content. This tactic has been ineffective since 2005.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Doorway pages===\n\"Gateway\" or [[doorway page]]s are low-quality web pages created with very little content, but are instead stuffed with very similar keywords and phrases. They are designed to rank highly within the search results, but serve no purpose to visitors looking for information. A doorway page will generally have \"click here to enter\" on the page; autoforwarding can also be used for this purpose. In 2006, Google ousted vehicle manufacturer [[BMW]] for using \"doorway pages\" to the company's German site, BMW.de.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Segal |title=The Dirty Little Secrets of Search |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/business/13search.html?pagewanted=all |work=[[The NY Times]] |date=2011-02-13 |accessdate=2012-07-03 }}</ref>\n\n===Scraper sites===\n[[Scraper sites]] are created using various programs designed to \"scrape\" search-engine results pages or other sources of content and create \"content\" for a website.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The specific presentation of content on these sites is unique, but is merely an amalgamation of content taken from other sources, often without permission. Such websites are generally full of advertising (such as [[pay per click|pay-per-click]] ads), or they redirect the user to other sites. It is even feasible for scraper sites to outrank original websites for their own information and organization names.\n\n===Article spinning===\n[[Article spinning]] involves rewriting existing articles, as opposed to merely scraping content from other sites, to avoid penalties imposed by search engines for [[duplicate content]]. This process is undertaken by hired writers or automated using a [[thesaurus]] database or a [[neural network]].\n\n===Machine translation===\nSimilarly to [[article spinning]], some sites use machine translation to render their content in several languages, with no human editing, resulting in unintelligible texts that nonetheless continue to be indexed by search engines, thereby attracting traffic.\n \n===Pages with no information related to page title===\n{{Confusing|section|date=July 2014}}\nPublishing web pages that contain information that is unrelated to the title is a misleading practice known as deception. Despite being a target for penalties from the leading search engines that rank pages, deception is a common practice in some types of sites, including dictionary and encyclopedia sites.\n\n==Link spam==\n'''Link spam''' is defined as links between pages that are present for reasons\nother than merit.<ref name=Davison>{{Citation\n  | first=Brian | last=Davison | author-link=Brian D. Davison\n  | contribution = Recognizing Nepotistic Links on the Web\n  | contribution-url = http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/pubs/2000/aaaiws/aaai2000ws.pdf\n  | title=AAAI-2000 workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Web Search\n  | year=2000 | pages=23\u201328 | publisher=AAAI Press | place=Boston\n}}</ref> Link spam takes advantage of link-based ranking algorithms, which gives [[websites]] higher rankings the more other highly ranked websites link to it. These techniques also aim at influencing other link-based ranking techniques such as the [[HITS algorithm]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Link farms===\n{{main|Link farm}}\nLink farms are tightly-knit networks of websites that link to each other for the sole purpose of gaming the search engine ranking algorithms. These are also known facetiously as ''mutual admiration societies''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/courses/is141/f05/lectures/se-course-intro.pdf|title=Search Engines:Technology, Society, and Business - Marti Hearst, Aug 29, 2005|author=|date=|website=berkeley.edu}}</ref> Use of links farms has been greatly reduced after Google launched the first Panda Update in February 2011, which introduced significant improvements in its spam-detection algorithm.\n\n=== Private blog networks ===\nBlog networks (PBNs) are a group of authoritative websites used as a source of contextual links that point to the owner's main website to achieve higher search engine ranking. Owners of PBN websites use expired domains or [[Domain name auction|auction domains]] that have [[backlink]]s from high-authority websites. Google targeted and penalized PBN users on several occasions with several massive deindexing campaigns since 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-targets-sites-using-private-blog-networks-manual-action-ranking-penalties-204000|title=Google Targets Sites Using Private Blog Networks With Manual Action Ranking Penalties|date=2014-09-23|newspaper=Search Engine Land|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref>\n\n===Hidden links===\nPutting [[hyperlink]]s where visitors will not see them to increase [[link popularity]]. Highlighted link text can help rank a webpage higher for matching that phrase.\n\n===Sybil attack===\nA [[Sybil attack]] is the forging of multiple identities for malicious intent, named after the famous [[multiple personality disorder]] patient \"[[Sybil (Schreiber book)|Sybil]]\". A spammer may create multiple web sites at different [[domain name]]s that all link to each other, such as fake blogs (known as [[spam blogs]]).\n\n===Spam blogs===\n{{main|Spam blog}}\nSpam blogs are blogs created solely for commercial promotion and the passage of link authority to target sites. Often these \"splogs\" are designed in a misleading manner that will give the effect of a legitimate website but upon close inspection will often be written using spinning software or be very poorly written and barely readable content. They are similar in nature to link farms.\n\n===Guest blog spam===\n\nGuest blog spam is the process of placing guest blogs on websites for the sole purpose of gaining a link to another website or websites. Unfortunately, these are often confused with legitimate forms of guest blogging with other motives than placing links. This technique was made famous by Matt Cutts, who publicly declared \"war\" against this form of link spam.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/guest-blogging/|title=The decay and fall of guest blogging for SEO|author=|date=20 January 2014|website=mattcutts.com}}</ref>\n\n===Buying expired domains===\n{{See also|Domaining}}\nSome link spammers utilize expired domain crawler software or monitor DNS records for domains that will expire soon, then buy them when they expire and replace the pages with links to their pages. However, it is possible but not confirmed that Google resets the link data on expired domains. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} To maintain all previous Google ranking data for the domain, it is advisable that a buyer grab the domain before it is \"dropped\". \n   \nSome of these techniques may be applied for creating a [[Google bomb]] \u2014 that is, to cooperate with other users to boost the ranking of a particular page for a particular query.\n\n===Cookie stuffing===\n[[Cookie stuffing]] involves placing an [[affiliate marketing|affiliate]] tracking cookie on a website visitor's computer without their knowledge, which will then generate revenue for the person doing the cookie stuffing. This not only generates fraudulent affiliate sales, but also has the potential to overwrite other affiliates' cookies, essentially stealing their legitimately earned commissions.\n\n=== Using world-writable pages ===\n{{main|Forum spam}}\nWeb sites that can be edited by users can be used by spamdexers to insert links to spam sites if the appropriate anti-spam measures are not taken.\n\nAutomated [[spambot]]s can rapidly make the user-editable portion of a site unusable.\nProgrammers have developed a variety of automated [[Forum spam#Spam prevention|spam prevention techniques]] to block or at least slow down spambots.\n\n====Spam in blogs====\n{{main|Spam in blogs}}\n[[Spam in blogs]] is the placing or solicitation of links randomly on other sites, placing a desired keyword into the hyperlinked text of the inbound link. Guest books, forums, blogs, and any site that accepts visitors' comments are particular targets and are often victims of drive-by spamming where automated software creates nonsense posts with links that are usually irrelevant and unwanted.\n\n====Comment spam====\nComment spam is a form of link spam that has arisen in web pages that allow dynamic user editing such as [[wikis]], [[blogs]], and [[guestbooks]]. It can be problematic because [[Software agent|agents]] can be written that automatically randomly select a user edited web page, such as a Wikipedia article, and add spamming links.<ref name=Mishne>{{cite conference\n  | first = Gilad | last = Mishne | authorlink = Gilad Mishne |author2=David Carmel |author3=Ronny Lempel\n  | title = Blocking Blog Spam with Language Model Disagreement\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web\n  | pages= | publisher= | year=2005 | url = http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/2005/mishne.pdf\n  | accessdate = 2007-10-24 }}</ref>\n\n====Wiki spam====\nWiki spam is a form of link spam on wiki pages. The spammer uses the open editability of wiki systems to place links from the wiki site to the spam site. The subject of the spam site is often unrelated to the wiki page where the link is added.\n\n====Referrer log spamming====\n[[Referrer spam]] takes place when a spam perpetrator or facilitator accesses a [[web page]] (the ''referee''), by following a link from another web page (the ''[[referrer]]''), so that the referee is given the address of the referrer by the person's Internet browser. Some [[website]]s have a referrer log which shows which pages link to that site. By having a [[Internet bot|robot]] randomly access many sites enough times, with a message or specific address given as the referrer, that message or Internet address then appears in the referrer log of those sites that have referrer logs. Since some [[Web search engine]]s base the importance of sites on the number of different sites linking to them, referrer-log spam may increase the search engine rankings of the spammer's sites.  Also, site administrators who notice the referrer log entries in their logs may follow the link back to the spammer's referrer page.\n\n==== Countermeasures ====\nBecause of the large amount of spam posted to user-editable webpages, Google proposed a nofollow tag that could be embedded with links. A link-based search engine, such as Google's [[PageRank]] system, will not use the link to increase the score of the linked website if the link carries a nofollow tag. This ensures that spamming links to user-editable websites will not raise the sites ranking with search engines. Nofollow is used by several major websites, including [[WordPress|Wordpress]], [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] and [[Wikipedia]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n==Other types==\n\n===Mirror websites===\nA [[mirror website|mirror site]] is the hosting of multiple websites with conceptually similar content but using different [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]]. Some search engines give a higher rank to results where the keyword searched for appears in the URL.\n\n===URL redirection===\n[[URL redirection]] is the taking of the user to another page without his or her intervention, ''e.g.'', using [[META refresh]] tags, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]],  [[JavaScript]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[Server side redirect]]s. However, [[HTTP 301|301 Redirect]], or permanent redirect, is not considered as a malicious behavior.\n\n===Cloaking===\n[[Cloaking]] refers to any of several means to serve a page to the search-engine [[Web crawler|spider]] that is different from that seen by human users. It can be an attempt to mislead search engines regarding the content on a particular web site. Cloaking, however, can also be used to ethically increase accessibility of a site to users with disabilities or provide human users with content that search engines aren't able to process or parse. It is also used to deliver content based on a user's location; Google itself uses [[IP delivery]], a form of cloaking, to deliver results. Another form of cloaking is ''code swapping'', ''i.e.'', optimizing a page for top ranking and then swapping another page in its place once a top ranking is achieved. Google refers to these type of redirects as ''Sneaky Redirects''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721217?hl=en|title=Sneaky redirects - Search Console Help|author=|date=|website=support.google.com}}</ref>\n\n== Countermeasures ==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== By search engine maintainer ===\nSpamdexed pages are sometimes eliminated from search results by the search engine.\n\n=== By search engine user ===\nUsers can craft at search keyword, for example, a keyword preceding \"-\" (minus) will eliminate sites that contains the keyword in their pages or in their domain of URL of the pages from search result. Example, search keyword \"-naver\" will eliminate sites that contains word \"naver\" in their pages and the pages whose domain of URL contains \"naver\".\n\n=== Google Chrome extension ===\n\nGoogle itself launched the [[Google Chrome]] extension \"Personal Blocklist (by Google)\" in 2011 as part of countermeasures against [[content farm]]ing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigazine.net/news/20161129-personal-blocklist-by-google/|title=Google\u691c\u7d22\u7d50\u679c\u306e\u60aa\u8cea\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u975e\u8868\u793a\uff06\u901a\u5831\u3057\u691c\u7d22\u54c1\u8cea\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u8ca2\u732e\u3067\u304d\u308bGoogle\u516c\u5f0fChrome\u62e1\u5f35\u6a5f\u80fd\u300cPersonal Blocklist\u300d|author=|date=|website=gigazine.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/googles-personal-blocklist-delete-google-search-results-on-chrome-64757|title=New: Block Sites From Google Results Using Chrome's \"Personal Blocklist\" - Search Engine Land|author=|date=14 February 2011|website=searchengineland.com}}</ref>  As of 2018, the extension only works with the [[Personal Computer|PC]] version of Google Chrome.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Adversarial information retrieval]]\n* [[Index (search engine)]] \u2013 overview of search engine indexing technology\n* [[TrustRank]]\n* [[Web scraping]]\n*[[Microsoft SmartScreen]]\n*[[Windows Defender]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n\n{{Spamming}}\n\n[[Category:Black hat search engine optimization]]\n[[Category:Spamming]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Deliberate manipulation of search engine indexes}}\n{{more citations needed|date=February 2013}}\nIn [[digital marketing]] and [[online advertising]], '''spamdexing''' (also known as '''search engine spam''', '''search engine poisoning''', '''[[Black hat hacker|black-hat]] [[search engine optimization]] (SEO)''', '''search spam''' or '''web spam''')<ref>[http://searchengineland.com/what-is-search-engine-spam-the-video-edition-15202.php  ''SearchEngineLand'', Danny Sullivan's video explanation of Search Engine Spam, October 2008] .

Also, large webpages are truncated, so that massive dictionary lists cannot be indexed on a single webpage.{{cn|date=December 2019}} (However, spammers can circumvent this webpage-size limitation merely by setting up multiple webpages, either independently or linked to each other.)\n  \n=== Hidden or invisible text ===\nUnrelated [[hidden text]] is disguised by making it the same color as the background, using a tiny font size, or hiding it within [[HTML]] code such as \"no frame\" sections, [[alt attribute]]s, zero-sized [[Span and div|DIVs]], and \"no script\" sections. People manually screening red-flagged websites for a search-engine company might temporarily or permanently block an entire website for having invisible text on some of its pages. However, hidden text is not always spamdexing: it can also be used to enhance [[web accessibility|accessibility]].\n\n===Meta-tag stuffing===\nThis involves repeating keywords in the [[meta tag]]s, and using meta keywords that are unrelated to the site's content. This tactic has been ineffective since 2005.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Doorway pages===\n\"Gateway\" or [[doorway page]]s are low-quality web pages created with very little content, but are instead stuffed with very similar keywords and phrases. They are designed to rank highly within the search results, but serve no purpose to visitors looking for information. A doorway page will generally have \"click here to enter\" on the page; autoforwarding can also be used for this purpose. In 2006, Google ousted vehicle manufacturer [[BMW]] for using \"doorway pages\" to the company's German site, BMW.de.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Segal |title=The Dirty Little Secrets of Search |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/business/13search.html?pagewanted=all |work=[[The NY Times]] |date=2011-02-13 |accessdate=2012-07-03 }}</ref>\n\n===Scraper sites===\n[[Scraper sites]] are created using various programs designed to \"scrape\" search-engine results pages or other sources of content and create \"content\" for a website.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The specific presentation of content on these sites is unique, but is merely an amalgamation of content taken from other sources, often without permission. Such websites are generally full of advertising (such as [[pay per click|pay-per-click]] ads), or they redirect the user to other sites. It is even feasible for scraper sites to outrank original websites for their own information and organization names.\n\n===Article spinning===\n[[Article spinning]] involves rewriting existing articles, as opposed to merely scraping content from other sites, to avoid penalties imposed by search engines for [[duplicate content]]. This process is undertaken by hired writers or automated using a [[thesaurus]] database or a [[neural network]].\n\n===Machine translation===\nSimilarly to [[article spinning]], some sites use machine translation to render their content in several languages, with no human editing, resulting in unintelligible texts that nonetheless continue to be indexed by search engines, thereby attracting traffic.\n \n===Pages with no information related to page title===\n{{Confusing|section|date=July 2014}}\nPublishing web pages that contain information that is unrelated to the title is a misleading practice known as deception. Despite being a target for penalties from the leading search engines that rank pages, deception is a common practice in some types of sites, including dictionary and encyclopedia sites.\n\n==Link spam==\n'''Link spam''' is defined as links between pages that are present for reasons\nother than merit.<ref name=Davison>{{Citation\n  | first=Brian | last=Davison | author-link=Brian D. Davison\n  | contribution = Recognizing Nepotistic Links on the Web\n  | contribution-url = http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/pubs/2000/aaaiws/aaai2000ws.pdf\n  | title=AAAI-2000 workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Web Search\n  | year=2000 | pages=23\u201328 | publisher=AAAI Press | place=Boston\n}}</ref> Link spam takes advantage of link-based ranking algorithms, which gives [[websites]] higher rankings the more other highly ranked websites link to it. These techniques also aim at influencing other link-based ranking techniques such as the [[HITS algorithm]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Link farms===\n{{main|Link farm}}\nLink farms are tightly-knit networks of websites that link to each other for the sole purpose of gaming the search engine ranking algorithms. These are also known facetiously as ''mutual admiration societies''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/courses/is141/f05/lectures/se-course-intro.pdf|title=Search Engines:Technology, Society, and Business - Marti Hearst, Aug 29, 2005|author=|date=|website=berkeley.edu}}</ref> Use of links farms has been greatly reduced after Google launched the first Panda Update in February 2011, which introduced significant improvements in its spam-detection algorithm.\n\n=== Private blog networks ===\nBlog networks (PBNs) are a group of authoritative websites used as a source of contextual links that point to the owner's main website to achieve higher search engine ranking. Owners of PBN websites use expired domains or [[Domain name auction|auction domains]] that have [[backlink]]s from high-authority websites. Google targeted and penalized PBN users on several occasions with several massive deindexing campaigns since 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-targets-sites-using-private-blog-networks-manual-action-ranking-penalties-204000|title=Google Targets Sites Using Private Blog Networks With Manual Action Ranking Penalties|date=2014-09-23|newspaper=Search Engine Land|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref>\n\n===Hidden links===\nPutting [[hyperlink]]s where visitors will not see them to increase [[link popularity]]. Highlighted link text can help rank a webpage higher for matching that phrase.\n\n===Sybil attack===\nA [[Sybil attack]] is the forging of multiple identities for malicious intent, named after the famous [[multiple personality disorder]] patient \"[[Sybil (Schreiber book)|Sybil]]\". A spammer may create multiple web sites at different [[domain name]]s that all link to each other, such as fake blogs (known as [[spam blogs]]).\n\n===Spam blogs===\n{{main|Spam blog}}\nSpam blogs are blogs created solely for commercial promotion and the passage of link authority to target sites. Often these \"splogs\" are designed in a misleading manner that will give the effect of a legitimate website but upon close inspection will often be written using spinning software or be very poorly written and barely readable content. They are similar in nature to link farms.\n\n===Guest blog spam===\n\nGuest blog spam is the process of placing guest blogs on websites for the sole purpose of gaining a link to another website or websites. Unfortunately, these are often confused with legitimate forms of guest blogging with other motives than placing links. This technique was made famous by Matt Cutts, who publicly declared \"war\" against this form of link spam.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/guest-blogging/|title=The decay and fall of guest blogging for SEO|author=|date=20 January 2014|website=mattcutts.com}}</ref>\n\n===Buying expired domains===\n{{See also|Domaining}}\nSome link spammers utilize expired domain crawler software or monitor DNS records for domains that will expire soon, then buy them when they expire and replace the pages with links to their pages. However, it is possible but not confirmed that Google resets the link data on expired domains. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} To maintain all previous Google ranking data for the domain, it is advisable that a buyer grab the domain before it is \"dropped\". \n   \nSome of these techniques may be applied for creating a [[Google bomb]] \u2014 that is, to cooperate with other users to boost the ranking of a particular page for a particular query.\n\n===Cookie stuffing===\n[[Cookie stuffing]] involves placing an [[affiliate marketing|affiliate]] tracking cookie on a website visitor's computer without their knowledge, which will then generate revenue for the person doing the cookie stuffing. This not only generates fraudulent affiliate sales, but also has the potential to overwrite other affiliates' cookies, essentially stealing their legitimately earned commissions.\n\n=== Using world-writable pages ===\n{{main|Forum spam}}\nWeb sites that can be edited by users can be used by spamdexers to insert links to spam sites if the appropriate anti-spam measures are not taken.\n\nAutomated [[spambot]]s can rapidly make the user-editable portion of a site unusable.\nProgrammers have developed a variety of automated [[Forum spam#Spam prevention|spam prevention techniques]] to block or at least slow down spambots.\n\n====Spam in blogs====\n{{main|Spam in blogs}}\n[[Spam in blogs]] is the placing or solicitation of links randomly on other sites, placing a desired keyword into the hyperlinked text of the inbound link. Guest books, forums, blogs, and any site that accepts visitors' comments are particular targets and are often victims of drive-by spamming where automated software creates nonsense posts with links that are usually irrelevant and unwanted.\n\n====Comment spam====\nComment spam is a form of link spam that has arisen in web pages that allow dynamic user editing such as [[wikis]], [[blogs]], and [[guestbooks]]. It can be problematic because [[Software agent|agents]] can be written that automatically randomly select a user edited web page, such as a Wikipedia article, and add spamming links.<ref name=Mishne>{{cite conference\n  | first = Gilad | last = Mishne | authorlink = Gilad Mishne |author2=David Carmel |author3=Ronny Lempel\n  | title = Blocking Blog Spam with Language Model Disagreement\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web\n  | pages= | publisher= | year=2005 | url = http://airweb.cse.lehigh.edu/2005/mishne.pdf\n  | accessdate = 2007-10-24 }}</ref>\n\n====Wiki spam====\nWiki spam is a form of link spam on wiki pages. The spammer uses the open editability of wiki systems to place links from the wiki site to the spam site. The subject of the spam site is often unrelated to the wiki page where the link is added.\n\n====Referrer log spamming====\n[[Referrer spam]] takes place when a spam perpetrator or facilitator accesses a [[web page]] (the ''referee''), by following a link from another web page (the ''[[referrer]]''), so that the referee is given the address of the referrer by the person's Internet browser. Some [[website]]s have a referrer log which shows which pages link to that site. By having a [[Internet bot|robot]] randomly access many sites enough times, with a message or specific address given as the referrer, that message or Internet address then appears in the referrer log of those sites that have referrer logs. Since some [[Web search engine]]s base the importance of sites on the number of different sites linking to them, referrer-log spam may increase the search engine rankings of the spammer's sites.  Also, site administrators who notice the referrer log entries in their logs may follow the link back to the spammer's referrer page.\n\n==== Countermeasures ====\nBecause of the large amount of spam posted to user-editable webpages, Google proposed a nofollow tag that could be embedded with links. A link-based search engine, such as Google's [[PageRank]] system, will not use the link to increase the score of the linked website if the link carries a nofollow tag. This ensures that spamming links to user-editable websites will not raise the sites ranking with search engines. Nofollow is used by several major websites, including [[WordPress|Wordpress]], [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] and [[Wikipedia]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n==Other types==\n\n===Mirror websites===\nA [[mirror website|mirror site]] is the hosting of multiple websites with conceptually similar content but using different [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]]. Some search engines give a higher rank to results where the keyword searched for appears in the URL.\n\n===URL redirection===\n[[URL redirection]] is the taking of the user to another page without his or her intervention, ''e.g.'', using [[META refresh]] tags, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]],  [[JavaScript]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[Server side redirect]]s. However, [[HTTP 301|301 Redirect]], or permanent redirect, is not considered as a malicious behavior.\n\n===Cloaking===\n[[Cloaking]] refers to any of several means to serve a page to the search-engine [[Web crawler|spider]] that is different from that seen by human users. It can be an attempt to mislead search engines regarding the content on a particular web site. Cloaking, however, can also be used to ethically increase accessibility of a site to users with disabilities or provide human users with content that search engines aren't able to process or parse. It is also used to deliver content based on a user's location; Google itself uses [[IP delivery]], a form of cloaking, to deliver results. Another form of cloaking is ''code swapping'', ''i.e.'', optimizing a page for top ranking and then swapping another page in its place once a top ranking is achieved. Google refers to these type of redirects as ''Sneaky Redirects''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721217?hl=en|title=Sneaky redirects - Search Console Help|author=|date=|website=support.google.com}}</ref>\n\n== Countermeasures ==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== By search engine maintainer ===\nSpamdexed pages are sometimes eliminated from search results by the search engine.\n\n=== By search engine user ===\nUsers can craft at search keyword, for example, a keyword preceding \"-\" (minus) will eliminate sites that contains the keyword in their pages or in their domain of URL of the pages from search result. Example, search keyword \"-naver\" will eliminate sites that contains word \"naver\" in their pages and the pages whose domain of URL contains \"naver\".\n\n=== Google Chrome extension ===\n\nGoogle itself launched the [[Google Chrome]] extension \"Personal Blocklist (by Google)\" in 2011 as part of countermeasures against [[content farm]]ing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigazine.net/news/20161129-personal-blocklist-by-google/|title=Google\u691c\u7d22\u7d50\u679c\u306e\u60aa\u8cea\u306a\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3092\u975e\u8868\u793a\uff06\u901a\u5831\u3057\u691c\u7d22\u54c1\u8cea\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306b\u8ca2\u732e\u3067\u304d\u308bGoogle\u516c\u5f0fChrome\u62e1\u5f35\u6a5f\u80fd\u300cPersonal Blocklist\u300d|author=|date=|website=gigazine.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/googles-personal-blocklist-delete-google-search-results-on-chrome-64757|title=New: Block Sites From Google Results Using Chrome's \"Personal Blocklist\" - Search Engine Land|author=|date=14 February 2011|website=searchengineland.com}}</ref>  As of 2018, the extension only works with the [[Personal Computer|PC]] version of Google Chrome.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Adversarial information retrieval]]\n* [[Index (search engine)]] \u2013 overview of search engine indexing technology\n* [[TrustRank]]\n* [[Web scraping]]\n*[[Microsoft SmartScreen]]\n*[[Windows Defender]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n\n{{Spamming}}\n\n[[Category:Black hat search engine optimization]]\n[[Category:Spamming]]\n", "name_user": "Benlow98", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamdexing"}

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\".

At the Madras session of Indian National Congress held in 1887, Bipin Chandra Pal made a strong plea for repeal of the Arms Act which was discriminatory in nature. Along with [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] and [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] he belonged to the [[Lal Bal Pal|Lal, Bal, Pal]] trio that was associated with revolutionary activity. [[Aurobindo Ghosh]] and Pal were recognised as the chief exponents of a new national movement revolving around the ideals of [[Purna Swaraj]], [[Swadeshi]], boycott and national education. His programme consisted of Swadeshi, boycott and national education. He preached and encouraged the use of Swadeshi and the boycott of foreign goods to eradicate poverty and unemployment. He wanted to remove social evils from the form and arouse the feelings of nationalism through national criticism. He had no faith in mild protests in the form of non-cooperation with the British colonialists. On that one issue, the assertive nationalist leader had nothing common with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. During the last six years of his life, he parted company with the Congress and led a secluded life. Sri Aurobindo referred to him as one of ''mightiest prophets of nationalism''.Bipin Chandra Pal made his efforts to remove social and economic ills. He opposed caste system and advocated widow  remarriage. He advocated 48 hours of work week and demanded for the hike in wages of workers.

At the Madras session of Indian National Congress held in 1887, Bipin Chandra Pal made a strong plea for repeal of the Arms Act which was discriminatory in nature. Along with [[Lala Lajpat Rai]] and [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] he belonged to the [[Lal Bal Pal|Lal, Bal, Pal]] trio that was associated with revolutionary activity. [[Aurobindo Ghosh]] and Pal were recognised as the chief exponents of a new national movement revolving around the ideals of [[Purna Swaraj]], [[Swadeshi]], boycott and national education. His programme consisted of Swadeshi, boycott and national education. He preached and encouraged the use of Swadeshi and the boycott of foreign goods to eradicate poverty and unemployment. He wanted to remove social evils from the form and arouse the feelings of nationalism through national criticism. He had no faith in mild protests in the form of non-cooperation with the British colonialists. On that one issue, the assertive nationalist leader had nothing common with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. During the last six years of his life, he parted company with the Congress and led a secluded life. Sri Aurobindo referred to him as one of ''mightiest prophets of nationalism''.Bipin Chandra Pal made his efforts to remove social and economic ills. He opposed caste system and advocated widow  remarriage. He advocated 48 hours of work week and demanded for the hike in wages of workers. He expressed his disdain for Gandhi's ways, which he criticised for being rooted in \u201cmagic\u201d instead of \u201clogic\u201d.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAs a journalist, Pal worked for ''Bengal Public Opinion'', [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|''The Tribune'']] and ''New India'', where he propagated his brand of nationalism.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://studentsmorningstar.com/Books.aspx|title=Total History & Civics|last=Sequeira|first=Dolly|publisher=Morning Star (A unit of MSB Publishers Pvt.
