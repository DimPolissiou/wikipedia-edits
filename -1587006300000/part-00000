Only 10 years old at the time of her death, her dismembered remains were found in November 2010.  Because of the crime's gruesome nature and the series of events leading up to her death, Zahra's murder received worldwide media coverage.<ref name=Lagan />  In September 2011, the victim's stepmother, Elisa Baker, pleaded guilty to murdering Zahra, and was sentenced to eighteen years in prison.  In 2013, she was given an additional 10 years for drug related charges.\n\n==Australia==\n\nZahra Baker was born to Emily Dietrich and Adam Baker who both lived in [[Wagga Wagga, Australia]].  Emily Dietrich, who had postpartum depression after Zahra's birth, gave up custody to Adam.  Adam took Zahra and moved with his parents to [[Giru, Queensland]], in 2004 to work for a sugar mill.  Zahra, who was diagnosed with [[bone cancer]] in 2005, later suffered a bout of lung cancer as well.  As a result, she had the lower part of one leg amputated and had to wear  hearing aids. Adam Baker reportedly met Elisa Fairchild (originally from western [[North Carolina]]) online on an [[IMVU]] website. Elisa Fairchild visited Adam Baker in [[Queensland]] and they were soon married. Elisa had been previously married six times and was still married at the time she married Adam Baker. Zahra's cancer went into remission in 2008, shortly before she moved to the [[United States]] from [[Australia]] with her father and new stepmother.<ref name=Lagan>{{cite web|last=Lagan|first=Bernard|title=What happened to Zahra Baker?|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/what-happened-to-zahra-baker-20110516-1eoxc.html|publisher=www.smh.com.au|date=May 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==North Carolina, U.S.A.==\n\nAfter moving to [[North Carolina]], the Bakers settled in [[Hickory, North Carolina|Hickory]] where Zahra attended  public school until she started being home schooled.  It is not known, though, if she was ever actually home schooled.  It is suspected Zahra was taken out of public school because reports of [[child abuse]] were made to the school, implicating Elisa.  Many neighbors of Zahra's claimed that Elisa was physically and mentally abusive, and neglected the child. Two teachers visited Zahra's home, after Zahra went to school with a black eye in a public school in [[Hudson, North Carolina|Hudson]] while she was in the fourth grade.<ref name=Lagan />  [[Child Protective Services]] from both [[Caldwell County, North Carolina|Caldwell County]] and [[Catawba County]] visited the various residences of Zahra multiple times before Zahra died.

Adam explained that they called 911 earlier that day about the fire and implied that whoever started the fire, may have done so in order to distract the family, in order to take Zahra.  Adam explained the purported kidnapper mistakenly confused Zahra for Mr. Coffey's daughter. Mark Coffey's daughter was unharmed and with her family, Adam stated.  Adam said the last time he saw his daughter was at 2:30 am.  Apparently, Adam Baker left for work early in the morning and did not return until after Zahra went to sleep.<ref name=Lagan />\n\n==Investigation==\n\n===Arrests and charges===\n\nReportedly, Elisa failed a [[polygraph]] test she had taken early in the investigation.

The dogs gave positive alerts to the scent of human remains on both of the Bakers' cars, the Chevrolet Tahoe and a sedan.  The police took swabs of what they thought may be blood from the car.  On October 10, 2010, Elisa Baker was also arrested for various crimes which included communicating threats, writing bad checks, [[larceny]] and driving with a revoked license, crimes unrelated to the death of Zahra.<ref name=\"De Nies\">{{cite web|last=De Nies|first=Yunji|title=Zahra Baker Case: Police Doubt $1M Ransom Note in Disabled Girl's Disappearance|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/zahra-baker-search-ransom-note-lack-witnesses-strain/story?id=11848643|publisher=abcnews.go.com|date=Oct 11, 2010}}</ref> Baker, who was jailed, was next charged with [[obstruction of justice]] after admitting that she wrote the ransom note, which led the police astray.<ref name=Ferran />\n\n===Bond hearing===\n\nIn late October 2010, a [[Catawba County]] judge raised Elisa's bond from $40,000 to $65,000 at a bond hearing, believing that Elisa was a flight risk.  Amber Fairchild, Elisa's daughter testified at the hearing and said her mother told her she was thinking of leaving [[North Carolina]] the day before she was arrested.  Amber Fairchild also said her mother was involved in an online relationship with a man from [[England]] who had sent her thousands of dollars.  The prosecutor said that Elisa failed to show up at other court dates for other charges which included traffic violations and communicating threats, thus thwarting Elisa's attorney's attempt to lower her bond.<ref name=Black>{{cite web|last=Black|first=Caroline|title=Zahra Clare Baker Update: Stepmother Elisa Baker Deemed Flight Risk, Bail Increased|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20020307-504083.html|publisher=cbsnews.com|date=Oct 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Discoveries===\nElisa Baker's aunt Buzzie Winkler told reporters that Elisa told her Zahra died after being sick for 2 weeks, and both parents dismembered her and hid the remains.

Because these items were often bought in bulk, they were named after the French word for wholesaler, or \"grossier\". This, in turn, is derived from the Medieval Latin term \"grossarius\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Grocer\n|work=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=2nd |date=1989}}</ref> from which the term \"gross\" (meaning a quantity of 12 dozen, or 144) is also derived.\n\nAs increasing numbers of [[staple food]]-stuffs became available in [[Canning|cans]] and other less-perishable packaging, the trade expanded its province.  Today, grocers deal in a wide range of staple food-stuffs including such perishables as [[dairy product]]s, [[meat]]s, and [[produce]]. Such goods are, hence, called ''groceries''. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nMany rural areas still contain general stores that sell goods ranging from tobacco products to imported napkins. Traditionally, general stores have offered credit to their customers, a system of payment that works on trust rather than modern [[credit card]]s.

Grocery stores specializing in imported so-called \"ethnic\" foods are popular in many immigrant communities, offering imported food that large supermarket chains do not.]]\n[[File:Storeisle.png|thumb|left|An example of an American grocery store aisle]]\n\nThe early supermarkets began as [[Chain store|chains]] of grocer's shops. The development of supermarkets and other large grocery stores has meant that smaller grocery stores often must create a [[niche market]] by selling unique, premium quality, or ethnic foods that are not easily found in supermarkets. A small grocery store may also compete by locating in a mixed commercial-residential area close to, and convenient for, its customers. Organic foods are also becoming a more popular niche market for the smaller stores.\n\nGrocery stores operate in many different styles ranging from rural family-owned operations, such as [[IGA (supermarkets)|IGAs]], to boutique chains, such as [[Whole Foods Market]] and [[Trader Joe's]], to larger supermarket chain stores such as [[Walmart]] and [[Kroger]] Marketplace. In some places, [[food cooperative]]s, or \"co-op\" markets, owned by their own shoppers, have been popular. However, there has recently been a trend towards larger stores serving larger geographic areas. Very large \"all-in-one\" [[hypermarket]]s such as [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], and [[Meijer]] have recently forced consolidation of the grocery businesses in some areas, and the entry of [[variety store]]s such as [[Dollar General]] into rural areas has undercut many traditional grocery stores. The global buying power of such very efficient companies has put an increased financial burden on traditional local grocery stores as well as the national [[supermarket]] chains, and many have been caught up in the [[retail apocalypse]] of the 2010s.\n\n[[File:Mercearia (grocery store) - Braga, Portugal.jpg|thumb|150px|Over-the-counter grocery store in [[Portugal]]]]\nHowever, many European cities ([[Rome]], for example) are already so dense in population and buildings, large supermarkets, in the American sense, may not replace the neighbourhood grocer's shop. However, \"Metro\" shops have been appearing in town and city centres in many countries, leading to the decline of independent smaller shops. Large out-of-town [[supermarket]]s and [[hypermarket]]s, such as [[Tesco]] and [[Sainsbury's]] in the [[United Kingdom]], have been steadily weakening trade from smaller shops. Many grocery chains like [[Spar (retailer)|Spar]] or [[Mace (store)|Mace]] are taking over the regular family business model.\n\nMore recently smaller grocery stores have begun to sell products online to compete with large online retailers like Amazon.com that purchased Whole Foods. Local Grocers have even started offering new services like home delivery. Most recently, some stores have started to partner with apps to alert customers when in-demand products become available.<ref name=\"It Arrived\">{{cite website|url=https://www.itarrived.org/|title=It Arrived | accessdate=2020-04-15}}</ref> \n\n==Regional variations==\n{{further|List of supermarket chains}}\n{{generalize|section|date=April 2014|reason=can't have this much detail for every brand in the world (would be too long), so this needs to be more general information on brand and chains}}\n\n===Europe===\nLarger grocer complexes that include other facilities, such as [[petrol station]]s, is especially common in the [[United Kingdom]], where major chains such as [[Sainsbury's]] and [[Tesco]] have many locations operating under this format. Traditional shops throughout [[Europe]] have been preserved because of their history and their classic appearance. They are sometimes still found in rural areas, although they are rapidly disappearing.\n\n===South America===\n[[File:Tucuman Hipermercado Jumbo Portal Tucuman.JPG|thumb | right | 150px |A [[Jumbo (hypermarkets)|Jumbo]] hypermarket in Argentina]]\n\nGrocery stores in [[South America]] have been growing fast since the early 1980s. A large percentage of food sales and other articles take place in grocery stores today. Some examples are the [[Chile]]an chains [[Cencosud]] (Jumbo and Santa Isabel covering [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]]), [[Walmart Chile|Walmart]] ([[L\u00edder|Lider]] and [[Ekono]]) as well as [[Falabella (retail store)|Falabella]] ([[Tottus]] in Chile and Peru and Supermercados San Francisco in Chile). These three chains are subsidiaries of large retail companies which also have other kinds of business units, such as department stores and home improvement outlets. All three also operate their own credit cards, which are a key driver for sales, and they also sell insurance and operate travel agencies. These companies also run some malls in countries such as Argentina, Chile, Peru and Colombia.\n\nTwo other chains started in 2008: [[Unimarc]], which bought several small local chains and has over 20% of the grocery segment in Chile; and Southern Cross, a Chilean Investment Fund that has around 8.6% of the supermarket segment, mainly oriented to the southern areas of the country. In [[Puerto Rico]], popular grocery stores include [[Pueblo Supermarkets]] and [[Amigo Supermarkets|Amigo]].\n\n===North America===\nIn some countries such as the United States, grocery stores descended from [[trading post]]s, which sold not only food but clothing, furniture, household items, tools, and other miscellaneous merchandise. These trading posts evolved into larger retail businesses known as [[general store]]s.

Organic foods are also becoming a more popular niche market for the smaller stores.\n\nGrocery stores operate in many different styles ranging from rural family-owned operations, such as [[IGA (supermarkets)|IGAs]], to boutique chains, such as [[Whole Foods Market]] and [[Trader Joe's]], to larger supermarket chain stores such as [[Walmart]] and [[Kroger]] Marketplace. In some places, [[food cooperative]]s, or \"co-op\" markets, owned by their own shoppers, have been popular. However, there has recently been a trend towards larger stores serving larger geographic areas. Very large \"all-in-one\" [[hypermarket]]s such as [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], and [[Meijer]] have recently forced consolidation of the grocery businesses in some areas, and the entry of [[variety store]]s such as [[Dollar General]] into rural areas has undercut many traditional grocery stores. The global buying power of such very efficient companies has put an increased financial burden on traditional local grocery stores as well as the national [[supermarket]] chains, and many have been caught up in the [[retail apocalypse]] of the 2010s.\n\n[[File:Mercearia (grocery store) - Braga, Portugal.jpg|thumb|150px|Over-the-counter grocery store in [[Portugal]]]]\nHowever, many European cities ([[Rome]], for example) are already so dense in population and buildings, large supermarkets, in the American sense, may not replace the neighbourhood grocer's shop. However, \"Metro\" shops have been appearing in town and city centres in many countries, leading to the decline of independent smaller shops. Large out-of-town [[supermarket]]s and [[hypermarket]]s, such as [[Tesco]] and [[Sainsbury's]] in the [[United Kingdom]], have been steadily weakening trade from smaller shops. Many grocery chains like [[Spar (retailer)|Spar]] or [[Mace (store)|Mace]] are taking over the regular family business model.\n\n==Regional variations==\n{{further|List of supermarket chains}}\n{{generalize|section|date=April 2014|reason=can't have this much detail for every brand in the world (would be too long), so this needs to be more general information on brand and chains}}\n\n===Europe===\nLarger grocer complexes that include other facilities, such as [[petrol station]]s, is especially common in the [[United Kingdom]], where major chains such as [[Sainsbury's]] and [[Tesco]] have many locations operating under this format. Traditional shops throughout [[Europe]] have been preserved because of their history and their classic appearance. They are sometimes still found in rural areas, although they are rapidly disappearing.\n\n===South America===\n[[File:Tucuman Hipermercado Jumbo Portal Tucuman.JPG|thumb | right | 150px |A [[Jumbo (hypermarkets)|Jumbo]] hypermarket in Argentina]]\n\nGrocery stores in [[South America]] have been growing fast since the early 1980s. A large percentage of food sales and other articles take place in grocery stores today. Some examples are the [[Chile]]an chains [[Cencosud]] (Jumbo and Santa Isabel covering [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]]), [[Walmart Chile|Walmart]] ([[L\u00edder|Lider]] and [[Ekono]]) as well as [[Falabella (retail store)|Falabella]] ([[Tottus]] in Chile and Peru and Supermercados San Francisco in Chile). These three chains are subsidiaries of large retail companies which also have other kinds of business units, such as department stores and home improvement outlets. All three also operate their own credit cards, which are a key driver for sales, and they also sell insurance and operate travel agencies. These companies also run some malls in countries such as Argentina, Chile, Peru and Colombia.\n\nTwo other chains started in 2008: [[Unimarc]], which bought several small local chains and has over 20% of the grocery segment in Chile; and Southern Cross, a Chilean Investment Fund that has around 8.6% of the supermarket segment, mainly oriented to the southern areas of the country. In [[Puerto Rico]], popular grocery stores include [[Pueblo Supermarkets]] and [[Amigo Supermarkets|Amigo]].\n\n===North America===\nIn some countries such as the United States, grocery stores descended from [[trading post]]s, which sold not only food but clothing, furniture, household items, tools, and other miscellaneous merchandise. These trading posts evolved into larger retail businesses known as [[general store]]s. These facilities generally dealt only in \"dry\" goods such as [[baking soda]], canned foods, dry beans, and flour. Perishable foods were obtained from specialty markets, such as fresh meat or sausages from a [[butcher]] and milk from a local [[dairy]], while eggs and vegetables were either produced by families themselves, bartered for with neighbors, or purchased at a [[farmers' market]] or a local [[greengrocer]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn the US, there are many larger [[chain store]]s, but there are also many small chains and independent grocery stores.  About 11% of groceries is sold by a grocery store that is either independent or in a chain of just one, two, or three stores, making the independent stores, taken collectively, bigger than the biggest chains.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://longreads.com/2019/04/23/the-man-whos-going-to-save-your-grocery-store/|title=The Man Who\u2019s Going to Save Your Neighborhood Grocery Store|last=Fassler|first=Joe|date=2019-04-23|website=Longreads|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\nMost food in the US is bought at traditional [[Brick and mortar|brick-and-mortar]] grocery stores.<ref name=\":0\" />  As of 2019, about 3% of food was bought from an online retailer such as Amazon.com.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe economic trends affecting grocery stores include:\n\n* In every decade since the 1960s, Americans have spent an increasing share of their money on eating at restaurants, which reduces their need to buy groceries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Groceries are sold by many other stores, such as [[convenience store]]s, [[drug stores]], and [[dollar stores]].<ref name=\":0\" />  The result of [[retail channel blurring]] is that even when people are buying groceries, only about half of them are buying groceries from a grocery store.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Online sales of food are small but increasing.

They differ from [[general store]]s and village shops in that they are not in a rural location and are used as a convenient supplement to larger shops.\n\nAlthough larger, newer convenience stores may have quite a broad range of items, the selection is still limited compared to supermarkets, and, in many stores, only 1 or 2 choices are available. Convenience stores usually charge significantly higher prices than ordinary grocery stores or [[supermarket]]s, which they make up for with convenience by serving more locations and having shorter cashier lines.<ref>''Understanding Food: Principles and Preparation'', Amy Brown, {{ISBN|978-0538734981}}, 2013</ref> Many convenience stores offer food ready to eat, such as breakfast sandwiches and other breakfast food.\n\n====Delicatessen====\nA [[delicatessen]] store is a type of food store where fine foods are sold.

The 2019 season was [[Scott Calabrese]]'s third year as head coach for the program.\n\nUCF finished the season with a 15\u20133\u20132 overall record and a 6\u20130\u20131 conference record, best in the AAC. The Knights advanced to the finals of the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament|AAC Tournament]] where they fell to [[2019 SMU Mustangs men's soccer team|SMU]] for the third consecutive year. They received an at-large bid to the the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and advanced to the third round where they were defeated by SMU. \n\n== Background ==\n{{main|2018 UCF Knights men's soccer team}}\nThe Knights are coming off a 13\u20133\u20133 season where they finished 5\u20131\u20131 in AAC play, earning them their first [[American Athletic Conference]] regular season title. In the [[2018 American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament]], UCF lost to [[SMU Mustangs men's soccer|SMU]] in [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], 4\u20135 after a 1\u20131 draw in regulation and extra time. UCF earned an at-large berth into the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], where they were one of the 16 seeded teams (out of 48 teams total) given the 14 seed. It was UCF's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011. With the seed, they earned a bye into the second round where they hosted the winner of Washington and Lipscomb. Lipscomb beat Washington in penalties, and also ended up beating the Knights in overtime, thus ending the season for UCF.\n\nJunior striker, Cal Jennings, lead UCF in goals and assists for 2018 and was named a [[2018 NCAA Men's Soccer All-Americans|consensus All-American]] with [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]], ''[[Soccer America]]'', [[United Soccer Coaches]], and CollegeSoccerNews.com all naming him as a first-team All-American.\n\n== Player movement ==\n=== Departures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; \"\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Name\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Nat.\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Number\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Position\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Height\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Weight\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Year\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Hometown\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Reason for departure\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Andreas|Steineger|nolink=1}} || {{flag|NOR}} || 2 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=4}} || 190 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Oslo|Oslo, NOR]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Zachary|Waitman|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 5 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 165 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Montverde, Florida|Montverde, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Jonathan|Dean|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 6 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 155 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Macon, Georgia|Macon, GA]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Gorka|Aperribay|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 9 || {{sort|4|[[Forward (association football)|FW]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=1}} || 185 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Walker|Dawkins|nolink=1}}|| {{flag|USA}}  || 11 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=7}} || 135 || {{sort|4|RS-Senior}} || [[Royal Palm Beach, Florida|Royal Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9|Dulysse|nolink=1}} || {{flag|HAI}} || 16 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=0}} || 173 || {{sort|2|Sophomore}} || [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Transferred to [[Manhattan Jaspers soccer|Manhattan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gojaspers.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-soccer-manhattan-adds-two-for-2019.aspx|title=Manhattan Adds Two For 2019|website=Manhattan College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|C.

The regular season began on August 30 and concluded on November 5. It was the program's 44th season fielding a men's varsity soccer team, and their 7th season in the AAC. The 2019 season was [[Scott Calabrese]]'s third year as head coach for the program.\n\nUCF finished the season with a 15\u20133\u20132 overall record and a 6\u20130\u20131 conference record, best in the AAC. The Knights advanced to the finals of the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament|AAC Tournament]] where they fell to [[2019 SMU Mustangs men's soccer team|SMU]] for the third consecutive year. They received an at-large bid to the the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and advanced to the third round where they were defeated by SMU. \n\n== Background ==\n{{main|2018 UCF Knights men's soccer team}}\nThe Knights are coming off a 13\u20133\u20133 season where they finished 5\u20131\u20131 in AAC play, earning them their first [[American Athletic Conference]] regular season title. In the [[2018 American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament]], UCF lost to [[SMU Mustangs men's soccer|SMU]] in [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], 4\u20135 after a 1\u20131 draw in regulation and extra time. UCF earned an at-large berth into the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], where they were one of the 16 seeded teams (out of 48 teams total) given the 14 seed. It was UCF's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011. With the seed, they earned a bye into the second round where they hosted the winner of Washington and Lipscomb. Lipscomb beat Washington in penalties, and also ended up beating the Knights in overtime, thus ending the season for UCF.\n\nJunior striker, Cal Jennings, lead UCF in goals and assists for 2018 and was named a [[2018 NCAA Men's Soccer All-Americans|consensus All-American]] with [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]], ''[[Soccer America]]'', [[United Soccer Coaches]], and CollegeSoccerNews.com all naming him as a first-team All-American.\n\n== Player movement ==\n=== Departures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; \"\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Name\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Nat.\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Number\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Position\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Height\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Weight\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Year\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Hometown\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Reason for departure\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Andreas|Steineger|nolink=1}} || {{flag|NOR}} || 2 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=4}} || 190 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Oslo|Oslo, NOR]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Zachary|Waitman|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 5 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 165 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Montverde, Florida|Montverde, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Jonathan|Dean|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 6 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 155 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Macon, Georgia|Macon, GA]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Gorka|Aperribay|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 9 || {{sort|4|[[Forward (association football)|FW]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=1}} || 185 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Walker|Dawkins|nolink=1}}|| {{flag|USA}}  || 11 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=7}} || 135 || {{sort|4|RS-Senior}} || [[Royal Palm Beach, Florida|Royal Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9|Dulysse|nolink=1}} || {{flag|HAI}} || 16 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=0}} || 173 || {{sort|2|Sophomore}} || [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Transferred to [[Manhattan Jaspers soccer|Manhattan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gojaspers.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-soccer-manhattan-adds-two-for-2019.aspx|title=Manhattan Adds Two For 2019|website=Manhattan College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|C.

Part of the record-breaking [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]], which included three of the  ten [[List of the most intense tropical cyclones#North Atlantic Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricanes]] ever (along with #4 [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and #7 [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]]), Wilma was the twenty-second storm, thirteenth [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]], sixth [[major hurricane]], fourth [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] hurricane, and the second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 [[Atlantic hurricane season|season]]. A [[tropical depression]] formed in the [[Caribbean Sea]] near [[Jamaica]] on October 15, headed westward, and intensified into a [[tropical storm]] two days later, which abruptly turned southward and was named ''Wilma''. Wilma continued to strengthen, and eventually became a hurricane on October 18. Shortly thereafter, [[Rapid intensification|explosive intensification]] occurred, and in only 24 hours, Wilma became a Category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of {{convert|185|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nWilma's intensity slowly leveled off after becoming a Category 5 hurricane, and winds had decreased to {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} before it reached the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] on October 20 and 21. After crossing the Yucat\u00e1n, Wilma emerged into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as a Category 2 hurricane. As it began accelerating to the northeast, gradual re-intensification occurred, and the hurricane was upgraded to Category 3 status on October 24. Shortly thereafter, Wilma made landfall in [[Cape Romano]], [[Florida]] with winds of {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. As Wilma was crossing Florida, it briefly weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane, but again re-intensified as it reached the Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane intensified into a Category 3 hurricane for the last time, before weakening while accelerating northeastward. By October 26, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] southeast of [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nWilma made several landfalls, with the most destructive effects felt in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of [[Mexico]], [[Cuba]], and the U.S. state of Florida.

During this time, [[Atlantic hurricane season|major Atlantic hurricanes]] occurred slightly more frequently than average; they just did not make landfall in the United States.  Also, after Wilma, no hurricane struck the state of Florida until [[Hurricane Hermine]] did so nearly 11 years later in 2016, and no major hurricane struck Florida until nearly 12 years later when [[Hurricane Irma]] made landfall in early September 2017.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Wilma}}\n{{storm path|Wilma 2005 track.png}}\nDuring mid-October 2005, a large [[monsoon trough|monsoon-like]] system developed in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. A broad [[low pressure area]] formed on October&nbsp;13 to the southeast of Jamaica, which slowly became more defined. On October&nbsp;15, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while located about {{convert|220|mi|km|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Grand Cayman]]. The depression drifted southwestward through a favorable environment, including warm [[sea surface temperature]]s. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on October&nbsp;17, whereupon the NHC [[tropical cyclone naming|named]] it ''Wilma''. Initial intensification was slow, due to Wilma's large size and a flat [[pressure gradient]], although the associated [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] gradually organized.<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\nOn October&nbsp;18, Wilma intensified into a hurricane, and subsequently underwent [[rapid deepening|explosive deepening]] over the open waters of the Caribbean Sea. In a 30&ndash;period through October&nbsp;19, Wilma's [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] dropped from 982&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] (29.00&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHg]]) to 882&nbsp;mbar (26.05&nbsp;inHg); this made Wilma the [[List_of_the_most_intense_tropical_cyclones#North_Atlantic_Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricane on record]], based on pressure. During the same intensification period, the winds increased to a peak intensity of 185&nbsp;mph (295&nbsp;km/h), making Wilma a Category&nbsp;5 on the [[Saffir-Simpson scale]]. An [[eyewall replacement cycle]] caused Wilma to weaken below Category&nbsp;5 status on October&nbsp;20, as it drifted northwestward toward Mexico's [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Late on October&nbsp;21, Wilma made landfall on the island of [[Cozumel]], [[Quintana Roo]], with sustained winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h). About six hours later, Wilma made a second landfall on the Mexican mainland near [[Puerto Morelos]].<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n{{Most intense hurricanes|align=right}}\nThe hurricane weakened over land, but re-intensified once it reached the Gulf of Mexico. Wilma accelerated to the northeast, steered by a powerful [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. After passing northwest of the [[Florida Keys]], the hurricane struck southwestern Florida near [[Cape Romano]] on October&nbsp;24 with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). Wilma rapidly crossed the state and weakened, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near [[Jupiter, Florida]]. The hurricane briefly re-intensified while passing north of the Bahamas, absorbing the smaller [[Tropical Storm Alpha (2005)|Tropical Storm Alpha]] to the east. The hurricane passed west of [[Bermuda]] on October&nbsp;25. After cold air and wind shear penetrated the core of convection, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on October&nbsp;26 to the south of Nova Scotia; it was absorbed by another extratropical storm a day later over [[Atlantic Canada]].<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n===Records===\nAt 18:01&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;19, a [[Hurricane Hunters]] [[dropsonde]] measured a barometric pressure of {{convert|884|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} in the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] of Wilma, along with sustained winds of 23&nbsp;mph (46&nbsp;km/h); the wind value suggested that the central pressure was slightly lower, estimated at {{convert|882|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}.

The 2005 edition eventually took place using a modified format on December 22.\n\n===Cuba===\nThe United States offered emergency aid to [[Cuba]], and to the surprise of the State Department, the Cuban government accepted. Many times in the past, including during [[Hurricane Dennis]], the United States offered aid, but the Cuban government declined.

Part of the record-breaking [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]], which included three of the  ten [[List of the most intense tropical cyclones#North Atlantic Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricanes]] ever (along with #4 [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and #7 [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]]), Wilma was the twenty-second storm, thirteenth [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]], sixth [[major hurricane]], fourth [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] hurricane, and the second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 [[Atlantic hurricane season|season]]. A [[tropical depression]] formed in the [[Caribbean Sea]] near [[Jamaica]] on October 15, headed westward, and intensified into a [[tropical storm]] two days later, which abruptly turned southward and was named ''Wilma''. Wilma continued to strengthen, and eventually became a hurricane on October 18. Shortly thereafter, [[Rapid intensification|explosive intensification]] occurred, and in only 24 hours, Wilma became a Category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of {{convert|185|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nWilma's intensity slowly leveled off after becoming a Category 5 hurricane, and winds had decreased to {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} before it reached the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] on October 20 and 21. After crossing the Yucat\u00e1n, Wilma emerged into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as a Category 2 hurricane. As it began accelerating to the northeast, gradual re-intensification occurred, and the hurricane was upgraded to Category 3 status on October 24. Shortly thereafter, Wilma made landfall in [[Cape Romano]], [[Florida]] with winds of {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. As Wilma was crossing Florida, it briefly weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane, but again re-intensified as it reached the Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane intensified into a Category 3 hurricane for the last time, before weakening while accelerating northeastward. By October 26, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] southeast of [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nWilma made several landfalls, with the most destructive effects felt in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of [[Mexico]], [[Cuba]], and the U.S. state of Florida. At least 62 deaths were reported and damage totaled to $27.4 billion, of which $19 billion occurred in the United States.<ref name=\"tcr\">{{cite web|author1=Richard J. Pasch |author2=Eric S.

During this time, [[Atlantic hurricane season|major Atlantic hurricanes]] occurred slightly more frequently than average; they just did not make landfall in the United States.  Also, after Wilma, no hurricane struck the state of Florida until [[Hurricane Hermine]] did so nearly 11 years later in 2016, and no major hurricane struck Florida until nearly 12 years later when [[Hurricane Irma]] made landfall in early September 2017.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Wilma}}\n{{storm path|Wilma 2005 track.png}}\nDuring mid-October 2005, a large [[monsoon trough|monsoon-like]] system developed in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. A broad [[low pressure area]] formed on October&nbsp;13 to the southeast of Jamaica, which slowly became more defined. On October&nbsp;15, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four while located about {{convert|220|mi|km|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Grand Cayman]]. The depression drifted southwestward through a favorable environment, including warm [[sea surface temperature]]s. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on October&nbsp;17, whereupon the NHC [[tropical cyclone naming|named]] it ''Wilma''. Initial intensification was slow, due to Wilma's large size and a flat [[pressure gradient]], although the associated [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] gradually organized.<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\nOn October&nbsp;18, Wilma intensified into a hurricane, and subsequently underwent [[rapid deepening|explosive deepening]] over the open waters of the Caribbean Sea. In a 30&ndash;period through October&nbsp;19, Wilma's [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] dropped from 982&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]] (29.00&nbsp;[[Inch of mercury|inHg]]) to 882&nbsp;mbar (26.05&nbsp;inHg); this made Wilma the [[List_of_the_most_intense_tropical_cyclones#North_Atlantic_Ocean|most intense Atlantic hurricane on record]], based on pressure. During the same intensification period, the winds increased to a peak intensity of 185&nbsp;mph (295&nbsp;km/h), making Wilma a Category&nbsp;5 on the [[Saffir-Simpson scale]]. An [[eyewall replacement cycle]] caused Wilma to weaken below Category&nbsp;5 status on October&nbsp;20, as it drifted northwestward toward Mexico's [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Late on October&nbsp;21, Wilma made landfall on the island of [[Cozumel]], [[Quintana Roo]], with sustained winds of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h). About six hours later, Wilma made a second landfall on the Mexican mainland near [[Puerto Morelos]].<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n{{Most intense hurricanes|align=right}}\nThe hurricane weakened over land, but re-intensified once it reached the Gulf of Mexico. Wilma accelerated to the northeast, steered by a powerful [[trough (meteorology)|trough]]. After passing northwest of the [[Florida Keys]], the hurricane struck southwestern Florida near [[Cape Romano]] on October&nbsp;24 with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). Wilma rapidly crossed the state and weakened, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near [[Jupiter, Florida]]. The hurricane briefly re-intensified while passing north of the Bahamas, absorbing the smaller [[Tropical Storm Alpha (2005)|Tropical Storm Alpha]] to the east. The hurricane passed west of [[Bermuda]] on October&nbsp;25. After cold air and wind shear penetrated the core of convection, Wilma transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on October&nbsp;26 to the south of Nova Scotia; it was absorbed by another extratropical storm a day later over [[Atlantic Canada]].<ref name=\"tcr\"/>\n\n===Records===\nAt 18:01&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;19, a [[Hurricane Hunters]] [[dropsonde]] measured a barometric pressure of {{convert|884|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} in the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] of Wilma, along with sustained winds of 23&nbsp;mph (46&nbsp;km/h); the wind value suggested that the central pressure was slightly lower, estimated at {{convert|882|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}.

The 2008-2014 county development plan recorded 36 designated natural heritage sites of international and national importance in County Kilkenny, covering approximately 4.5% of the county.<ref>[http://www.kilkennycoco.ie/resources/eng/Services/Planning/Draft%20Development%20Plans/County/DraftCountyDevelopmentPlan2008-2014/Ch8_Heritage.pdf Chapter 8 - Heritage], Draft County Kilkenny Development Plan 2008\u20132014 - [[Kilkenny County Council]]</ref>\n\n==== Mountains and hills ====\n[[File:BrandonHill91.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brandon Hill]]]]\n{{See also|List of mountains in Ireland}}\nCounty Kilkenny is comparably low compared to other [[Geography of Ireland#Mountain ranges|mountain ranges in Ireland]] with the [[List of Irish counties by highest point|highest peak]] being [[Brandon Hill]] ({{irish place name|Cnoc Bhr\u00e9anail|}}), at {{convert|515|m|ft}} above [[sea level]]. The majority of rest of the county is hilly except for the centre of the County, just south of the city of [[Kilkenny]], which is comparably lower than the rest of the county. There are highlands in the North-East, the North-West and in the South of the county.\n\nIn the north of the county the uplands of the [[Castlecomer]] district, the [[Castlecomer Plateau]] includes the Culla Hills to the west of the [[River Nore|Nore]] Valley with Castlecomer Hills and Slieve Marcy to the east. These hills are divided by the valley of the [[Dinan]] river which joins the [[River Nore|Nore]] from the east. The highest point of the Castlecomer Hills is {{convert|313|m|ft}}, and located North-West of the town of Castlecomer and near the border with [[County Laois|Laois]]. The highest point of the Culla Hills is in Laois at {{convert|279|m|ft}}, but its undulating slopes spread over a considerable area of Kilkenny in the north-westerly area.\n\nIn the west of the county the [[Slieveardagh Hills]] and [[Booley Hills]] extend westwards to County Tipperary. The highest point in the Slieveardagh Hills is [[Knocknamuck]] at {{convert|340|m|ft}}. The Booley Mountains partly divide from [[Tory Hill]] to the valley of the Kilmacow River which flows into the [[River Suir|Suir]].\n\nIn the south of the county is [[Brandon Hill]], at {{convert|515|m|ft}} and is near the [[River Barrow|Barrow]] and [[Graiguenamanagh]]. The area enclosed between the rivers [[River Nore|Nore]] and [[River Barrow|Barrow]] towards their point of joining is elevated. Along the west of the [[River Barrow|Barrow]] and [[River Nore|Nore]] is mostly covered by hills of nearly equal elevation except along the left bank of the river Suir. Here there is a rich area of land between the river and the hills.\n\n===Baronies===\n{{See also|Baronies of Ireland}}\nThe county is subdivided into twelve [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] which are in turn divided into [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parishes]] and [[townland]]s. There are about 800 townlands in Kilkenny. Each barony was made up of a number of parishes or parts of parishes. Both civil parishes and baronies are now largely obsolete (except for purposes such as legal transactions involving land) and are no longer used for local government purposes.\n[[File:Ireland - 1885 Map of County Kilkenny.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Baronies of County Kilkenny]]\n# [[Callan (barony)|Callan]] (''Callainn'')\n# [[Cranagh (barony)|Cranagh]] (''Crannach'')\n# [[Fassadinin]] (''F\u00e1sach an Deighn\u00edn'')\n# [[Barony of Galmoy|Galmoy]] (''Gabhalmhaigh'')\n# [[Gowran (barony)|Gowran]] (''Gabhr\u00e1n'')\n# [[Barony of Ida|Ida]] (''U\u00ed Dhe\u00e1'')\n# [[Iverk]] (''U\u00edbh Eirc'')\n# [[Kells (County Kilkenny barony)|Kells]] (''Ceanannas'')\n# [[Kilculliheen]] (''Cill Choilch\u00edn'')\n# [[Kilkenny (barony)|Kilkenny]] (''Cill Chainnigh'')\n# [[Knocktopher (barony)|Knocktopher]] (''Cnoc an T\u00f3chair'')\n# [[Shillelogher (barony)|Shillelogher]] (''S\u00edol Fhaolchair'')\n\n===Civil parishes and townlands===\n{{Main|List of townlands of County Kilkenny}}\nFor religious administration, the county was divided into parishes. Every parish had at least one church. The barony boundaries and the parish boundaries were not connected.\n\nFrom the 17th to mid-19th centuries, civil parishes were based on early Christian and medieval monastic and church settlements. The civil parishes are divided into [[townland]]s (See [[List of townlands in County Kilkenny]]). As the population grew, new parishes were created and the civil parish covered the same area as the established [[Church of Ireland]]. The Roman Catholic Church adapted to a new structure based on towns and villages. There 2,508 civil parishes in Ireland, which often break both [[barony (Ireland)|barony]] and [[Counties of Ireland|county]] boundaries.\n\n===Towns and Villages===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Ballyhale]]\n* [[Ballyragget]]\n* [[Bennettsbridge]]\n* [[Callan, County Kilkenny|Callan]]\n* [[Carrigeen]]\n* [[Castlecomer]]\n* [[Castlewarren]]\n* [[Clogh, County Kilkenny|Clogh]]\n* Coan\n* [[Cuffesgrange]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Danesfort]] \n* [[Dungarvan, County Kilkenny|Dungarvan]]\n* [[Dunnamaggin|Dunnamaggan]]\n* [[Ferrybank, Waterford|Ferrybank]]\n* [[Flagmount]]\n* [[Freshford, County Kilkenny|Freshford]]\n* [[Galmoy]]\n* [[Goresbridge]]\n* [[Gowran]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Graiguenamanagh]]\n* Glenmore\n* [[Hugginstown]]\n* [[Inistioge]]\n* [[Jenkinstown, County Kilkenny|Jenkinstown]]\n* [[Johnstown, County Kilkenny|Johnstown]]\n* [[Johnswell]]\n* [[Kilkenny]]\n* [[Killinaspick]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Kilmacow]]\n* [[Kilmoganny]]\n* [[Knocktopher]]\n* Kilmanagh\n* [[Moneenroe]]\n* [[Mooncoin]]\n* [[Mullinavat]]\n* [[Paulstown]]\n* [[Piltown]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Redhouse, Kilkenny|Redhouse]]\n* [[Rosbercon|Tullogher-Rosbercon]]\n* [[Slieverue]]\n* [[Stoneyford, County Kilkenny|Stoneyford]]\n* [[Thomastown]]\n* [[Tullaroan]]\n* [[The Rower]]\n* [[Urlingford]]\n* [[Windgap, County Kilkenny|Windgap]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Local government and politics==\n===Local Government===\n{{main|Kilkenny County Council}}\nLocal government in County Kilkenny is governed by the ''Local Government Acts'', the most recent of which ([[Local Government Reform Act 2014]]) established a unitary structure of [[local government]]. This single-tier structure consists of [[Kilkenny County Council]]. Until 2014, the second tier of local government consisted of [[Kilkenny Borough Council]] which was a [[Town Councils in the Republic of Ireland|town council]]. The city of [[Kilkenny]] was allowed to use the title of \"Borough Council\" instead of \"Town Council\", but Kilkenny Borough Council had no additional responsibilities. Since the enactment of the aforementioned Act on 1 June 2014, which abolished the borough, the county council is solely responsible for local services.\n\nFor the purposes of local government, Kilkenny is divided into 4 [[Municipal district (Ireland)|local electoral areas]] - Callan\u2013Thomastown (6), Castlecomer (6), Kilkenny city (7) and Piltown (5) - which return a total of 24 elected members to Kilkenny County Council. The [[2019 Kilkenny County Council election|2019 Kilkenny local elections]] had a voter turnout of 53%, a decrease of 4.1% on the [[2014 Kilkenny County Council election|2014 election]]. The highest turnout was in Callan\u2013Thomastown (56.4%) and the lowest was in Kilkenny city (50.4%).\n\nIn the 2019 local elections, [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and [[Fine Gael]] emerged as the two dominant parties, holding 20 of the 24 seats between them. The [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] hold 2 seats, the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] hold 1 seat, and there is 1 independent. [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], which had held 3 seats, failed to gain a seat in the 2019 election.

The present form of the constituency was created for the [[1948 Irish general election|1948 general election]]. Kilkenny has been represented through several parliamentary constituencies in the past. From 1918\u20131921 Kilkenny was part of the [[North Kilkenny (UK Parliament constituency)|North Kilkenny]] [[List of former United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|United Kingdom Parliamentary constituency]]. In 1921 the [[Carlow\u2013Kilkenny (D\u00e1il constituency)|Carlow\u2013Kilkenny]] D\u00e1il constituency was created and has stayed apart from between 1937 and 1948 when there was just a [[Kilkenny (D\u00e1il constituency)|Kilkenny constituency]].\n\n===European Elections===\nFor statistical purposes at European level, the county is part of the [[South-East Region, Ireland|South-East Region]] - a NUTS III entity - which is in turn part of the level II NUTS entity - Southern. The county is located within the [[South (European Parliament constituency)|South]] constituency for elections to the [[European Parliament]]. The constituency has 5 seats and comprises the South-East, [[South-West Region, Ireland|South-West]] and [[Mid-West Region, Ireland|Mid-West]] regions of Ireland.\n\nAs the county is part of the [[South-East Region, Ireland|South-East Region]], some county councillors are also representatives on the Southern Regional Assembly.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kilkenny St Canice Cathedral SW 2007 08 28.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Canice's Cathedral]] and round tower around which Kilkenny developed]]\n\nCounty Kilkenny takes its name from the [[city status in Ireland|city]] of [[Kilkenny]]. Kilkenny is the anglicised version of the Irish ''Cill Chainnigh'', meaning ''Church (Cell) of Cainneach or Canice''. This probably relates to the church and [[Irish round tower|round tower]], now St. Canice's Cathedral, which was built in honour of [[Cainnech of Aghaboe|St. Canice]].\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Osraige]] was one of the ancient [[Kingdoms of Ireland]].  The [[Kings of Osraige]], the [[Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig]] family, reigned over [[Kingdom of Osraige|Osraige]] and Cill Chainnigh was their stronghold. The [[Kingdom of Ossory]] existed from at least the 2nd century until the 13th century AD. The current [[ecclesiastical]] [[diocese]]s of that area is still known as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ossory|Ossory]]. The medieval [[Diocese of Ossory]]<ref>Downham, \"Career\", p. 7; Mac Niocaill, ''Ireland before the Vikings'', pp. 3&#x2013;4.</ref> and was established in 549 AD,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/osso0.htm |title=Diocese of Ossory |publisher= |accessdate=2010-10-08}}. GCatholic.org. Retrieved on 2010-10-08.</ref> and its territory corresponded to the medieval [[Kingdom of Ossory]]. In historic times, Kilkenny replaced [[Aghaboe]] as the chief church in Osraige.\n\nThe kingdom was bounded by two of the [[The Three Sisters (Ireland)|Three Sisters]] the rivers [[River Barrow|Barrow]] and [[River Suir|Suir]] and the northern limit was, generally, the [[Slieve Bloom Mountains]].  The Osraige &mdash;their name means people of the deer&mdash; inhabited much of modern County Kilkenny and parts of neighbouring [[County Laois]]. To the west and south, Osraige was bounded by the [[River Suir]], to the east the watershed of the [[River Barrow]] marked the boundary with Leinster, and to the north it extended into and beyond the [[Slieve Bloom Mountains]].  The River Nore ran through the Kingdom.\n\nOsraige formed the easternmost part of the kingdom and province of [[Munster]] until the middle of the 9th century, after which it was attached to Leinster. Osraige was largely a [[buffer state]] between [[Leinster]] and [[Munster]]. Its most significant neighbours were the Lo\u00edgsi, [[U\u00ed Cheinnselaig]] and U\u00ed Baircche of Leinster to the north and east and the D\u00e9isi Muman, [[E\u00f3ganacht Chaisil]] and \u00c9ile of Munster to the south and west.<ref>Byrne, ''Irish kings and high-kings'', maps on pp. 133 & 172&#x2013;173; Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'', p. 236, map 9 & p. 532, map 13.</ref>\n\nThe name Osraige is said to be from the Usdaie, a [[List of Celtic tribes#Ireland|Celtic tribe]] that [[Ptolemy]]'s map of Ireland places in roughly the same area that Osraige would later occupy. The territory indicated by Ptolemy probably included the major late Iron Age hill-fort at [[Freestone Hill]] which produced some Roman finds. Also the interesting burial at [[Stoneyford, County Kilkenny|Stoneyford]] which is of typical Roman type and probably dates to the 1st century AD.<ref name=\"Knock\">{{Harvnb|Knock|2006|p=284}}</ref> The Osraighe themselves claimed to be descended from the [[\u00c9rainn]] people.

The Cisternians came to [[Jerpoint Abbey|Jerpoint]] and Kilkenny around 1155/60. Jerpoint Abbey is founded by Donal MacGiollaPhadruig, King of Ossory 1158. In 1168, [[Dermot MacMurrough]] the [[King of Leinster]] was driven out of his kingdom by [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair|Rory O'Connor]] the [[High King of Ireland]] with the help of [[Tighearn\u00e1n Ua Ruairc|Tiernan O'Rourke]]. [[Dermot MacMurrough|MacMurrough]] looked for help from [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and got help from a [[Cambro-Norman]] lord notable [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]], known to history as Strongbow. MacMurrough secured the services of Richard, promising him the hand of his daughter [[Aoife MacMurrough|Aoife of Leinster]] and the succession to Leinster. Richard and other [[Welsh Marches|Marcher]] barons and knights by King Henry assembled an army. The army, under [[Raymond FitzGerald|Raymond le Gros]], took [[Wexford]], [[Waterford]] and [[Dublin]] in 1169 and 1170, and Strongbow joined them in August 1170. The day after the capture of Waterford, he married MacMorrough's daughter, Aoife.\n\nThe [[Lordship of Ireland]] was a [[lordship]] created in the wake of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169\u201371. Kilkenny formed part of the lordship of Leinster. Strongbow became Lord of Leinster in 1171.\n\nFollowing the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]], the island of Ireland was divided into thirty-two [[county|counties]]. The [[Republic of Ireland]] today is made up of twenty-six of the traditional thirty-two counties with the other six forming [[Northern Ireland]]. Two former counties in the Republic have been subdivided, giving a modern total of twenty-nine [[administrative counties|counties for administrative purposes]] rather than twenty-six.\n\n==Places of interest==\n=== Architecture ===\n{{See also|Architecture of Ireland}}\nThe architecture of County Kilkenny contains features from all eras since the [[Stone Age]] including [[Norman architecture|Norman]] and [[Anglo-Irish]] [[castle]]s, [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] urban buildings, towns and villages with unique architectures, [[Palladian architecture|palladian]] and [[rococo]] [[country houses]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] [[cathedral]]s and buildings. In the late 20th century a new economic climate resulted in a renaissance of culture and design, with some at the cutting edge of [[modern architecture]]. County Kilkenny contains varied architecture including [[passage grave]]s, [[ringfort]]s, [[Irish round tower]]s, castles, churches and cathedrals, [[abbey]]s and [[Priory|priories]], bridges and roads, and [[townhouse]]s of varying style.\n\n==== Early architecture ====\n[[File:The Gowran Ogham Stone.jpg|thumbnail|right|180px|The Gowran Ogham Stone.

There are great burial mounds including the portal tombs and dolmens at Owning, [[Kilmogue Portal Tomb|Kilmogue-Harristown]] and Borrismore. There are passage graves at Clomantagh Hill and [[Knockroe Passage Tomb|Knockroe]]. There were non-megalith single-grave burial tombs, Linkardstown-type Cists, excavated at Jerpoint West. These are late Neolithic and before the single-grave rite of the Bronze Age.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ryan|1973}},{{Harvnb|Moody|2005}}</ref> A [[Neolithic]] house was identified in [[Granny, County Kilkenny|Granny]] near [[Waterford]], making it the oldest house in County Kilkenny.

The Gowran Ogham Stone which is on display in [[St. Mary's Collegiate Church Gowran]] is an example of a Christianised ogham stone. The ogham lettering is from the 3rd or 4th century. The Christian cross was carved c. 6th century following St. Patrck's arrival in Ireland in 432 AD. The ogham stone was found on the site during the rebuilding of the chancel in 1826. The Gowran Ogham Stone has survived to the present day due to the fact that it was used as a building stone in another part of the church and lay undisturbed for centuries.\n\n[[Passage grave]]s consisted of a central burial chamber, with a long passageway to the entrance. [[Knockroe Passage Tomb|Knockroe]] contains a passage tomb which is protected by listing order. From some time beginning around the Iron Age, Ireland has thousands of [[ringfort]]s, or \"raths\". [[Carigeen]], [[Danesfort]], [[Dunbell big]] and [[Tullaroan]] all contain ring forts protected by preservation order.\n\nThe [[Irish round tower|round stone tower]] is one feature of ''early historic architecture'' not usually found outside Ireland with only three in [[Scotland]] and one on the [[Isle of Man]]. The tower at [[St Canice's Cathedral]] in [[Kilkenny|Kilkenny City]] is a good example. Other round towers are situated around the county such as [[Tullaherin]] round tower, one near [[Bennettsbridge]], [[Kells, County Kilkenny|Kells]], [[Johnstown, County Kilkenny|Johnstown]], and [[Aghaviller]] near [[Knocktopher]].\n\n====Castles====\n[[File:KilkennyCastle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kilkenny Castle]]]]\n{{See also|List of castles in the Republic of Ireland#County Kilkenny|l1=List of Castles in County Kilkenny}}\n\n[[Kilkenny Castle]] is a [[castle]] in [[Kilkenny]]. It was the seat of the Butler family. Formerly the family name was FitzWalter. The castle was sold to the local Castle Restoration Committee in the middle of the 20th century for [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]50. Shortly afterwards it was handed over to the State, and has since been refurbished and is open to visitors. Part of the National Art Gallery is on display in the castle. There are ornamental gardens on the town side of the castle, and extensive land and gardens to the front. It has become one of the most visited tourist sites in Ireland.\n\n[[Foulksrath Castle]] is a 15th-century [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[tower house]] located in [[Jenkinstown, County Kilkenny|Jenkinstown]] in County Kilkenny. It was built by the Purcell clan, who also constructed several others nearby. After over three centuries as owners, the family was reduced to living as peasants in the castle stables after it was confiscated by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and given to his officers after the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]].\n\n==== Abbeys and priories ====\n{{See also|List_of_abbeys_and_priories_in_Ireland#County_Kilkenny|l1=List of abbeys and priories in County Kilkenny}}\n[[Jerpoint Abbey]] is a [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] abbey near [[Thomastown]]. It was constructed in 1180, probably on the site of an earlier [[Benedictine]] monastery built in 1160 by Domnall Mac Gilla Patraic, [[Kingdom of Osraige|King of Osraige]].<ref>''Illustrated Dictionary of Irish History.'' Mac Annaidh, S (ed). Gill and Macmillan, Dublin. 2001</ref> Jerpoint is notable for its stone carvings, including one at the tomb of Felix O'Dulany, [[Bishop of Ossory|Bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Ossory]] when the abbey was founded.\n[[File:Jerpoint Abbey E 1997 08 28.jpg|thumb|left|East front of [[Jerpoint Abbey]]]]\n[[File:Kells-Priory.jpg|thumb|[[Kells Priory]] in [[Kells, County Kilkenny|Kells]]]]\n[[File:Graiguenamanach Choir Window SE 1997 08 27.jpg|thumb|right|[[Duiske Abbey]] in [[Graiguenamanagh]]]]\n\n[[Duiske Abbey]] in [[Graiguenamanagh]] founded in 1204 was one of the first and largest [[Cistercians]] [[monastery|monasteries]] in Ireland. What remains of the monastery is a large gothic church which dominates the town centre in Graiguenamanagh. The abbey derives its name from the river Duiske or D\u00fabh Uisce which flows through the town on its way to the river Barrow which also flows through this town. Original floor tiles from the original building can be seen in the abbey along with the gothic and romanesque architecture.\n\nThe Black Abbey in Kilkenny, founded 1225, is a Dominican abbey with two-bay double-height lean-to lower aisle to south. It was extended, c. 1325, with four-bay double-height transept to south having four-bay double-height lean-to lower aisle to west.\n\n[[Kells Priory]] is one of the largest medieval historic monuments in Ireland. It is a [[National Monument (Ireland)|National Monument]] and is in the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works. The priory is scenically situated alongside King's River, about fifteen kilometres south of [[Kilkenny]]. One of its most striking feature is a collection of medieval [[tower house]]s spaced at intervals along and within walls which enclose a site of just over {{convert|3|acre|m2}}. These give the [[priory]] the appearance more of a fortress than of a place of worship and from them comes its local name of \"Seven Castles\".\n\nThe [[Callan Augustinian Friary]] is situated in [[Callan, County Kilkenny|Callan]]. It is known locally as the \"Abbey Meadow\" and is located at the North East of the town on the banks of the Kings Rover. Edmund Butler of Pottlerath, a noted patron of literature, successfully petitioned Pope Pius II for the foundation of the friary in 1461. After Edmund died in 1462, the actual buildings were erected by his son, James, probably after 1467 when he received a papal dispensation to marry his concubine, to whom he was related.\n\n==== 18th-century bridges ====\n[[File:Bennetsbridge42.jpg|thumb|left|Bennett's bridge in [[Bennettsbridge]] over the [[River Nore]]]]\nThere are many 18th-century bridges in County Kilkenny. These bridges are an important element of the civil engineering and transport heritage of County Kilkenny and so are included in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) Building Survey.<ref>[http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/highlights.jsp?county=KK&list=true Kilkenny Building Survey Highlights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529222116/http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/highlights.jsp?county=KK&list=true |date=29 May 2008 }}.''National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH)''</ref>\n\nThe Great Flood of 1763 washed away many of the major bridges crossing the [[River Nore]], and a comprehensive rebuilding programme was initiated. Many of the bridges are built to designs prepared by George Smith (1763\u201367), a pupil of [[George Semple]], and they feature Classical-style detailing, indicating the lasting influence of the illustrations included in [[Andrea Palladio]]'s ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' (1570). Smith designed [[Green's Bridge]] in [[Kilkenny]], [[Castlecomer]] Bridge on the Dinin (Deen) River; [[Thomastown]] Bridge on the River Nore; [[Graiguenamanagh]] Bridge on the River Barrow and [[Inistioge]] Bridge on the River Nore.\n[[File:St. Mary's Collegiate Church Gowran.jpg|thumbnail|St. Mary's Collegiate Church Gowran]]\nOther 18th-century bridges include; the bridges in [[Goresbridge]], [[Bennettsbridge]], [[Kells, County Kilkenny|Kells]], Threecastles, Dinin Bridge and the bridge at [[Mount Juliet Golf & Spa Hotel|Mount Juliet]].\n\n==== Churches ====\nIn Medieval times many fine churches in Ireland were also built such as [[St. Mary's Collegiate Church Gowran]], St. Canice's Cathedral in [[Kilkenny]] and [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Kilkenny|St. Mary's Cathedral]].\n\n[[St. Lachtain's Church]], [[Freshford, County Kilkenny|Freshford]] was built in 1731, incorporating a portal from 1100 as its main entrance, all that is left of the original church is the Hiberno-Romanesque (Irish-Roman) architectural porch and doorway. The remainder of the present church was built for Protestant worship in 1731. In St. Lachtains time Freshford was a diocese. In 1225 a bishops palace was built at Aghore (Achadh Ur), now Uppercourt. It was used as a summer residence for over 300 years.\n\n=== Tourist attractions ===\n{{See also|List of tourist attractions in Ireland}}\nIn County Kilkenny [[Jerpoint Abbey]] near [[Thomastown]], [[Kells Priory]] at [[Kells, County Kilkenny|Kells]].

The dialect shared the majority of its features with the surviving dialect of Ring in Co. Waterford. One distinct feature of the traditional Irish of Kilkenny (and Laois) as part of the Ossory dialect region was the pronunciation of [[slender R]] [\u027e\u02b2] as [\u0292\u02b2] like the G in the English word \"regime\". This [\u0292\u02b2] sound was devoiced to an \"sh\" sound when slender R was adjacent to the sound /h/. The Irish language scholar Riste\u00e1rd A. Breatnach wrote an MA thesis entitled \"Kilkenny Irish\" but this remains unpublished.\n\nBaile Sh\u00e9amais, in Glenmore, was home to P\u00e1draig Paor who was the last traditional native speaker of the Irish language in Co. Kilkenny. Audio-recordings were made of his speech in 1936 for the Irish Folklore Commission (Coimisi\u00fan B\u00e9aloideasa \u00c9ireann) by S\u00e9amus \u00d3 Duilearga and Riste\u00e1rd A Breatnach.<ref>\u00d3 h\u00d3g\u00e1in, D\u00e1ith\u00ed, Labhrann Laighnigh, Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, Coisc\u00e9im, 2011</ref> His speech contains the well-documented Ossory pronunciation of [[slender R]] [\u027e\u02b2] as [\u0292\u02b2], resembling the <j> sound of Standard French.\n\n==Economy==\n==== Cooperatives ====\n{{See also|Glanbia|Avonmore (Cooperative)}}\nIn 1966, County Kilkenny village creameries amalgamated to create [[Avonmore (Cooperative)|Avonmore]] Creameries, becoming Avonmore Food plc in 1988.

A large area in the north and east contains beds of coal, surrounded by limestone strata, alternated with shale, argillaceous ironstone, and sandstone. This occurs eastward of the [[River Nore|Nore]] around [[Castlecomer]], along the border with Laois. It is generally accompanied by [[culm Measures|culm]], which was used extensively for burning lime.\n\nThe natural environment and resources of County Kilkenny includes its rivers, wildlife (mammals, birds, plants), woodlands, hedgerows, and diverse landscapes and geological features. The main land use is grassland, dairy farming and tillage farming especially around Kilkenny City and in the fertile central plain of the Nore Valley. Conifer forests are found on the upland areas.\n\nHabitats of international and national importance, are designated under [[European Union]] and national legislation. The four categories of designated site in effect in County Kilkenny are [[Special Area of Conservation|Special Areas of Conservation]], Natural Heritage Areas, Statutory Nature Reserves and Wildfowl Sanctuaries. The 2008-2014 county development plan recorded 36 designated natural heritage sites of international and national importance in County Kilkenny, covering approximately 4.5% of the county.<ref>[http://www.kilkennycoco.ie/resources/eng/Services/Planning/Draft%20Development%20Plans/County/DraftCountyDevelopmentPlan2008-2014/Ch8_Heritage.pdf Chapter 8 - Heritage], Draft County Kilkenny Development Plan 2008\u20132014 - [[Kilkenny County Council]]</ref>\n\n==== Mountains and hills ====\n[[File:BrandonHill91.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brandon Hill]]]]\n{{See also|List of mountains in Ireland}}\nCounty Kilkenny is comparably low compared to other [[Geography of Ireland#Mountain ranges|mountain ranges in Ireland]] with the [[List of Irish counties by highest point|highest peak]] being [[Brandon Hill]] ({{irish place name|Cnoc Bhr\u00e9anail|}}), at {{convert|515|m|ft}} above [[sea level]]. The majority of rest of the county is hilly except for the centre of the County, just south of the city of [[Kilkenny]], which is comparably lower than the rest of the county. There are highlands in the North-East, the North-West and in the South of the county.\n\nIn the north of the county the uplands of the [[Castlecomer]] district, the [[Castlecomer Plateau]] includes the Culla Hills to the west of the [[River Nore|Nore]] Valley with Castlecomer Hills and Slieve Marcy to the east. These hills are divided by the valley of the [[Dinan]] river which joins the [[River Nore|Nore]] from the east. The highest point of the Castlecomer Hills is {{convert|313|m|ft}}, and located North-West of the town of Castlecomer and near the border with [[County Laois|Laois]]. The highest point of the Culla Hills is in Laois at {{convert|279|m|ft}}, but its undulating slopes spread over a considerable area of Kilkenny in the north-westerly area.\n\nIn the west of the county the [[Slieveardagh Hills]] and [[Booley Hills]] extend westwards to County Tipperary. The highest point in the Slieveardagh Hills is [[Knocknamuck]] at {{convert|340|m|ft}}. The Booley Mountains partly divide from [[Tory Hill]] to the valley of the Kilmacow River which flows into the [[River Suir|Suir]].\n\nIn the south of the county is [[Brandon Hill]], at {{convert|515|m|ft}} and is near the [[River Barrow|Barrow]] and [[Graiguenamanagh]]. The area enclosed between the rivers [[River Nore|Nore]] and [[River Barrow|Barrow]] towards their point of joining is elevated. Along the west of the [[River Barrow|Barrow]] and [[River Nore|Nore]] is mostly covered by hills of nearly equal elevation except along the left bank of the river Suir. Here there is a rich area of land between the river and the hills.\n\n===Baronies===\n{{See also|Baronies of Ireland}}\nThe county is subdivided into twelve [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] which are in turn divided into [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parishes]] and [[townland]]s. There are about 800 townlands in Kilkenny. Each barony was made up of a number of parishes or parts of parishes. Both civil parishes and baronies are now largely obsolete (except for purposes such as legal transactions involving land) and are no longer used for local government purposes.\n[[File:Ireland - 1885 Map of County Kilkenny.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Baronies of County Kilkenny]]\n# [[Callan (barony)|Callan]] (''Callainn'')\n# [[Cranagh (barony)|Cranagh]] (''Crannach'')\n# [[Fassadinin]] (''F\u00e1sach an Deighn\u00edn'')\n# [[Barony of Galmoy|Galmoy]] (''Gabhalmhaigh'')\n# [[Gowran (barony)|Gowran]] (''Gabhr\u00e1n'')\n# [[Barony of Ida|Ida]] (''U\u00ed Dhe\u00e1'')\n# [[Iverk]] (''U\u00edbh Eirc'')\n# [[Kells (County Kilkenny barony)|Kells]] (''Ceanannas'')\n# [[Kilculliheen]] (''Cill Choilch\u00edn'')\n# [[Kilkenny (barony)|Kilkenny]] (''Cill Chainnigh'')\n# [[Knocktopher (barony)|Knocktopher]] (''Cnoc an T\u00f3chair'')\n# [[Shillelogher (barony)|Shillelogher]] (''S\u00edol Fhaolchair'')\n\n===Civil parishes and townlands===\n{{Main|List of townlands of County Kilkenny}}\nFor religious administration, the county was divided into parishes. Every parish had at least one church. The barony boundaries and the parish boundaries were not connected.\n\nFrom the 17th to mid-19th centuries, civil parishes were based on early Christian and medieval monastic and church settlements. The civil parishes are divided into [[townland]]s (See [[List of townlands in County Kilkenny]]). As the population grew, new parishes were created and the civil parish covered the same area as the established [[Church of Ireland]]. The Roman Catholic Church adapted to a new structure based on towns and villages. There 2,508 civil parishes in Ireland, which often break both [[barony (Ireland)|barony]] and [[Counties of Ireland|county]] boundaries.\n\n===Towns and Villages===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Ballyhale]]\n* [[Ballyragget]]\n* [[Bennettsbridge]]\n* [[Callan, County Kilkenny|Callan]]\n* [[Carrigeen]]\n* [[Castlecomer]]\n* [[Castlewarren]]\n* [[Clogh, County Kilkenny|Clogh]]\n* Coan\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Danesfort]] \n* [[Dungarvan, County Kilkenny|Dungarvan]]\n* [[Dunnamaggin|Dunnamaggan]]\n* [[Ferrybank, Waterford|Ferrybank]]\n* [[Flagmount]]\n* [[Freshford, County Kilkenny|Freshford]]\n* [[Galmoy]]\n* [[Goresbridge]]\n* [[Gowran]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Graiguenamanagh]]\n* Glenmore\n* [[Hugginstown]]\n* [[Inistioge]]\n* [[Jenkinstown, County Kilkenny|Jenkinstown]]\n* [[Johnstown, County Kilkenny|Johnstown]]\n* [[Johnswell]]\n* [[Kilkenny]]\n* [[Killinaspick]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Kilmacow]]\n* [[Kilmoganny]]\n* [[Knocktopher]]\n* Kilmanagh\n* [[Moneenroe]]\n* [[Mooncoin]]\n* [[Mullinavat]]\n* [[Paulstown]]\n* [[Piltown]]\n{{Col-break}}\n* [[Redhouse, Kilkenny|Redhouse]]\n* [[Rosbercon|Tullogher-Rosbercon]]\n* [[Slieverue]]\n* [[Stoneyford, County Kilkenny|Stoneyford]]\n* [[Thomastown]]\n* [[Tullaroan]]\n* [[The Rower]]\n* [[Urlingford]]\n* [[Windgap, County Kilkenny|Windgap]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Local government and politics==\n===Local Government===\n{{main|Kilkenny County Council}}\nLocal government in County Kilkenny is governed by the ''Local Government Acts'', the most recent of which ([[Local Government Reform Act 2014]]) established a unitary structure of [[local government]]. This single-tier structure consists of [[Kilkenny County Council]]. Until 2014, the second tier of local government consisted of [[Kilkenny Borough Council]] which was a [[Town Councils in the Republic of Ireland|town council]]. The city of [[Kilkenny]] was allowed to use the title of \"Borough Council\" instead of \"Town Council\", but Kilkenny Borough Council had no additional responsibilities. Since the enactment of the aforementioned Act on 1 June 2014, which abolished the borough, the county council is solely responsible for local services.\n\nFor the purposes of local government, Kilkenny is divided into 4 [[Municipal district (Ireland)|local electoral areas]] - Callan\u2013Thomastown (6), Castlecomer (6), Kilkenny city (7) and Piltown (5) - which return a total of 24 elected members to Kilkenny County Council. The [[2019 Kilkenny County Council election|2019 Kilkenny local elections]] had a voter turnout of 53%, a decrease of 4.1% on the [[2014 Kilkenny County Council election|2014 election]]. The highest turnout was in Callan\u2013Thomastown (56.4%) and the lowest was in Kilkenny city (50.4%).\n\nIn the 2019 local elections, [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and [[Fine Gael]] emerged as the two dominant parties, holding 20 of the 24 seats between them. The [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] hold 2 seats, the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] hold 1 seat, and there is 1 independent. [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], which had held 3 seats, failed to gain a seat in the 2019 election. Council elections are held every 5 years, with the next election due to be held in May 2024.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|- \n!colspan=2|Party\n!Seats\n! % of votes\n! % Change since [[2014 Irish local elections|2014]]\n!

The present form of the constituency was created for the [[1948 Irish general election|1948 general election]]. Kilkenny has been represented through several parliamentary constituencies in the past. From 1918\u20131921 Kilkenny was part of the [[North Kilkenny (UK Parliament constituency)|North Kilkenny]] [[List of former United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|United Kingdom Parliamentary constituency]]. In 1921 the [[Carlow\u2013Kilkenny (D\u00e1il constituency)|Carlow\u2013Kilkenny]] D\u00e1il constituency was created and has stayed apart from between 1937 and 1948 when there was just a [[Kilkenny (D\u00e1il constituency)|Kilkenny constituency]].\n\n===European Elections===\nFor statistical purposes at European level, the county is part of the [[South-East Region, Ireland|South-East Region]] - a NUTS III entity - which is in turn part of the level II NUTS entity - Southern. The county is located within the [[South (European Parliament constituency)|South]] constituency for elections to the [[European Parliament]]. The constituency has 5 seats and comprises the South-East, [[South-West Region, Ireland|South-West]] and [[Mid-West Region, Ireland|Mid-West]] regions of Ireland.\n\nAs the county is part of the [[South-East Region, Ireland|South-East Region]], some county councillors are also representatives on the Southern Regional Assembly.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kilkenny St Canice Cathedral SW 2007 08 28.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Canice's Cathedral]] and round tower around which Kilkenny developed]]\n\nCounty Kilkenny takes its name from the [[city status in Ireland|city]] of [[Kilkenny]]. Kilkenny is the anglicised version of the Irish ''Cill Chainnigh'', meaning ''Church (Cell) of Cainneach or Canice''. This probably relates to the church and [[Irish round tower|round tower]], now St. Canice's Cathedral, which was built in honour of [[Cainnech of Aghaboe|St. Canice]].\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Osraige]] was one of the ancient [[Kingdoms of Ireland]].  The [[Kings of Osraige]], the [[Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig]] family, reigned over [[Kingdom of Osraige|Osraige]] and Cill Chainnigh was their stronghold. The [[Kingdom of Ossory]] existed from at least the 2nd century until the 13th century AD. The current [[ecclesiastical]] [[diocese]]s of that area is still known as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ossory|Ossory]]. The medieval [[Diocese of Ossory]]<ref>Downham, \"Career\", p. 7; Mac Niocaill, ''Ireland before the Vikings'', pp. 3&#x2013;4.</ref> and was established in 549 AD,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/osso0.htm |title=Diocese of Ossory |publisher= |accessdate=2010-10-08}}. GCatholic.org. Retrieved on 2010-10-08.</ref> and its territory corresponded to the medieval [[Kingdom of Ossory]]. In historic times, Kilkenny replaced [[Aghaboe]] as the chief church in Osraige.\n\nThe kingdom was bounded by two of the [[The Three Sisters (Ireland)|Three Sisters]] the rivers [[River Barrow|Barrow]] and [[River Suir|Suir]] and the northern limit was, generally, the [[Slieve Bloom Mountains]].  The Osraige &mdash;their name means people of the deer&mdash; inhabited much of modern County Kilkenny and parts of neighbouring [[County Laois]]. To the west and south, Osraige was bounded by the [[River Suir]], to the east the watershed of the [[River Barrow]] marked the boundary with Leinster, and to the north it extended into and beyond the [[Slieve Bloom Mountains]].  The River Nore ran through the Kingdom.\n\nOsraige formed the easternmost part of the kingdom and province of [[Munster]] until the middle of the 9th century, after which it was attached to Leinster. Osraige was largely a [[buffer state]] between [[Leinster]] and [[Munster]]. Its most significant neighbours were the Lo\u00edgsi, [[U\u00ed Cheinnselaig]] and U\u00ed Baircche of Leinster to the north and east and the D\u00e9isi Muman, [[E\u00f3ganacht Chaisil]] and \u00c9ile of Munster to the south and west.<ref>Byrne, ''Irish kings and high-kings'', maps on pp. 133 & 172&#x2013;173; Charles-Edwards, ''Early Christian Ireland'', p. 236, map 9 & p. 532, map 13.</ref>\n\nThe name Osraige is said to be from the Usdaie, a [[List of Celtic tribes#Ireland|Celtic tribe]] that [[Ptolemy]]'s map of Ireland places in roughly the same area that Osraige would later occupy. The territory indicated by Ptolemy probably included the major late Iron Age hill-fort at [[Freestone Hill]] which produced some Roman finds. Also the interesting burial at [[Stoneyford, County Kilkenny|Stoneyford]] which is of typical Roman type and probably dates to the 1st century AD.<ref name=\"Knock\">{{Harvnb|Knock|2006|p=284}}</ref> The Osraighe themselves claimed to be descended from the [[\u00c9rainn]] people.

The Cisternians came to [[Jerpoint Abbey|Jerpoint]] and Kilkenny around 1155/60. Jerpoint Abbey is founded by Donal MacGiollaPhadruig, King of Ossory 1158. In 1168, [[Dermot MacMurrough]] the [[King of Leinster]] was driven out of his kingdom by [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair|Rory O'Connor]] the [[High King of Ireland]] with the help of [[Tighearn\u00e1n Ua Ruairc|Tiernan O'Rourke]]. [[Dermot MacMurrough|MacMurrough]] looked for help from [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and got help from a [[Cambro-Norman]] lord notable [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]], known to history as Strongbow. MacMurrough secured the services of Richard, promising him the hand of his daughter [[Aoife MacMurrough|Aoife of Leinster]] and the succession to Leinster. Richard and other [[Welsh Marches|Marcher]] barons and knights by King Henry assembled an army. The army, under [[Raymond FitzGerald|Raymond le Gros]], took [[Wexford]], [[Waterford]] and [[Dublin]] in 1169 and 1170, and Strongbow joined them in August 1170. The day after the capture of Waterford, he married MacMorrough's daughter, Aoife.\n\nThe [[Lordship of Ireland]] was a [[lordship]] created in the wake of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169\u201371. Kilkenny formed part of the lordship of Leinster. Strongbow became Lord of Leinster in 1171.\n\nFollowing the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]], the island of Ireland was divided into thirty-two [[county|counties]]. The [[Republic of Ireland]] today is made up of twenty-six of the traditional thirty-two counties with the other six forming [[Northern Ireland]]. Two former counties in the Republic have been subdivided, giving a modern total of twenty-nine [[administrative counties|counties for administrative purposes]] rather than twenty-six.\n\n==Places of interest==\n=== Architecture ===\n{{See also|Architecture of Ireland}}\nThe architecture of County Kilkenny contains features from all eras since the [[Stone Age]] including [[Norman architecture|Norman]] and [[Anglo-Irish]] [[castle]]s, [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] urban buildings, towns and villages with unique architectures, [[Palladian architecture|palladian]] and [[rococo]] [[country houses]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] [[cathedral]]s and buildings. In the late 20th century a new economic climate resulted in a renaissance of culture and design, with some at the cutting edge of [[modern architecture]]. County Kilkenny contains varied architecture including [[passage grave]]s, [[ringfort]]s, [[Irish round tower]]s, castles, churches and cathedrals, [[abbey]]s and [[Priory|priories]], bridges and roads, and [[townhouse]]s of varying style.\n\n==== Early architecture ====\n[[File:The Gowran Ogham Stone.jpg|thumbnail|right|180px|The Gowran Ogham Stone.

There are great burial mounds including the portal tombs and dolmens at Owning, [[Kilmogue Portal Tomb|Kilmogue-Harristown]] and Borrismore. There are passage graves at Clomantagh Hill and [[Knockroe Passage Tomb|Knockroe]]. There were non-megalith single-grave burial tombs, Linkardstown-type Cists, excavated at Jerpoint West. These are late Neolithic and before the single-grave rite of the Bronze Age.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ryan|1973}},{{Harvnb|Moody|2005}}</ref> A [[Neolithic]] house was identified in [[Granny, County Kilkenny|Granny]] near [[Waterford]], making it the oldest house in County Kilkenny. The square house consisted of slot-trenches, internal floor surfaces, a hearth and wooden posts at each corner, one of the post-holes was radiocarbon-dated to 3997-3728 BC.

The Gowran Ogham Stone which is on display in [[St. Mary's Collegiate Church Gowran]] is an example of a Christianised ogham stone. The ogham lettering is from the 3rd or 4th century. The Christian cross was carved c. 6th century following St. Patrck's arrival in Ireland in 432 AD. The ogham stone was found on the site during the rebuilding of the chancel in 1826. The Gowran Ogham Stone has survived to the present day due to the fact that it was used as a building stone in another part of the church and lay undisturbed for centuries.\n\n[[Passage grave]]s consisted of a central burial chamber, with a long passageway to the entrance. [[Knockroe Passage Tomb|Knockroe]] contains a passage tomb which is protected by listing order. From some time beginning around the Iron Age, Ireland has thousands of [[ringfort]]s, or \"raths\". [[Carigeen]], [[Danesfort]], [[Dunbell big]] and [[Tullaroan]] all contain ring forts protected by preservation order.\n\nThe [[Irish round tower|round stone tower]] is one feature of ''early historic architecture'' not usually found outside Ireland with only three in [[Scotland]] and one on the [[Isle of Man]]. The tower at [[St Canice's Cathedral]] in [[Kilkenny|Kilkenny City]] is a good example. Other round towers are situated around the county such as [[Tullaherin]] round tower, one near [[Bennettsbridge]], [[Kells, County Kilkenny|Kells]], [[Johnstown, County Kilkenny|Johnstown]], and [[Aghaviller]] near [[Knocktopher]].\n\n====Castles====\n[[File:KilkennyCastle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kilkenny Castle]]]]\n{{See also|List of castles in the Republic of Ireland#County Kilkenny|l1=List of Castles in County Kilkenny}}\n\n[[Kilkenny Castle]] is a [[castle]] in [[Kilkenny]]. It was the seat of the Butler family. Formerly the family name was FitzWalter. The castle was sold to the local Castle Restoration Committee in the middle of the 20th century for [[Irish pound|\u00a3]]50. Shortly afterwards it was handed over to the State, and has since been refurbished and is open to visitors. Part of the National Art Gallery is on display in the castle. There are ornamental gardens on the town side of the castle, and extensive land and gardens to the front. It has become one of the most visited tourist sites in Ireland.\n\n[[Foulksrath Castle]] is a 15th-century [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[tower house]] located in [[Jenkinstown, County Kilkenny|Jenkinstown]] in County Kilkenny. It was built by the Purcell clan, who also constructed several others nearby. After over three centuries as owners, the family was reduced to living as peasants in the castle stables after it was confiscated by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and given to his officers after the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]].\n\n==== Abbeys and priories ====\n{{See also|List_of_abbeys_and_priories_in_Ireland#County_Kilkenny|l1=List of abbeys and priories in County Kilkenny}}\n[[Jerpoint Abbey]] is a [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] abbey near [[Thomastown]]. It was constructed in 1180, probably on the site of an earlier [[Benedictine]] monastery built in 1160 by Domnall Mac Gilla Patraic, [[Kingdom of Osraige|King of Osraige]].<ref>''Illustrated Dictionary of Irish History.'' Mac Annaidh, S (ed). Gill and Macmillan, Dublin. 2001</ref> Jerpoint is notable for its stone carvings, including one at the tomb of Felix O'Dulany, [[Bishop of Ossory|Bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Ossory]] when the abbey was founded.\n[[File:Jerpoint Abbey E 1997 08 28.jpg|thumb|left|East front of [[Jerpoint Abbey]]]]\n[[File:Kells-Priory.jpg|thumb|[[Kells Priory]] in [[Kells, County Kilkenny|Kells]]]]\n[[File:Graiguenamanach Choir Window SE 1997 08 27.jpg|thumb|right|[[Duiske Abbey]] in [[Graiguenamanagh]]]]\n\n[[Duiske Abbey]] in [[Graiguenamanagh]] founded in 1204 was one of the first and largest [[Cistercians]] [[monastery|monasteries]] in Ireland. What remains of the monastery is a large gothic church which dominates the town centre in Graiguenamanagh. The abbey derives its name from the river Duiske or D\u00fabh Uisce which flows through the town on its way to the river Barrow which also flows through this town. Original floor tiles from the original building can be seen in the abbey along with the gothic and romanesque architecture.\n\nThe Black Abbey in Kilkenny, founded 1225, is a Dominican abbey with two-bay double-height lean-to lower aisle to south. It was extended, c. 1325, with four-bay double-height transept to south having four-bay double-height lean-to lower aisle to west.\n\n[[Kells Priory]] is one of the largest medieval historic monuments in Ireland. It is a [[National Monument (Ireland)|National Monument]] and is in the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works. The priory is scenically situated alongside King's River, about fifteen kilometres south of [[Kilkenny]]. One of its most striking feature is a collection of medieval [[tower house]]s spaced at intervals along and within walls which enclose a site of just over {{convert|3|acre|m2}}. These give the [[priory]] the appearance more of a fortress than of a place of worship and from them comes its local name of \"Seven Castles\".\n\nThe [[Callan Augustinian Friary]] is situated in [[Callan, County Kilkenny|Callan]]. It is known locally as the \"Abbey Meadow\" and is located at the North East of the town on the banks of the Kings Rover. Edmund Butler of Pottlerath, a noted patron of literature, successfully petitioned Pope Pius II for the foundation of the friary in 1461. After Edmund died in 1462, the actual buildings were erected by his son, James, probably after 1467 when he received a papal dispensation to marry his concubine, to whom he was related.\n\n==== 18th-century bridges ====\n[[File:Bennetsbridge42.jpg|thumb|left|Bennett's bridge in [[Bennettsbridge]] over the [[River Nore]]]]\nThere are many 18th-century bridges in County Kilkenny. These bridges are an important element of the civil engineering and transport heritage of County Kilkenny and so are included in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) Building Survey.<ref>[http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/highlights.jsp?county=KK&list=true Kilkenny Building Survey Highlights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529222116/http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/highlights.jsp?county=KK&list=true |date=29 May 2008 }}.''National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH)''</ref>\n\nThe Great Flood of 1763 washed away many of the major bridges crossing the [[River Nore]], and a comprehensive rebuilding programme was initiated. Many of the bridges are built to designs prepared by George Smith (1763\u201367), a pupil of [[George Semple]], and they feature Classical-style detailing, indicating the lasting influence of the illustrations included in [[Andrea Palladio]]'s ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' (1570). Smith designed [[Green's Bridge]] in [[Kilkenny]], [[Castlecomer]] Bridge on the Dinin (Deen) River; [[Thomastown]] Bridge on the River Nore; [[Graiguenamanagh]] Bridge on the River Barrow and [[Inistioge]] Bridge on the River Nore.\n[[File:St. Mary's Collegiate Church Gowran.jpg|thumbnail|St. Mary's Collegiate Church Gowran]]\nOther 18th-century bridges include; the bridges in [[Goresbridge]], [[Bennettsbridge]], [[Kells, County Kilkenny|Kells]], Threecastles, Dinin Bridge and the bridge at [[Mount Juliet Golf & Spa Hotel|Mount Juliet]].\n\n==== Churches ====\nIn Medieval times many fine churches in Ireland were also built such as [[St. Mary's Collegiate Church Gowran]], St. Canice's Cathedral in [[Kilkenny]] and [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Kilkenny|St. Mary's Cathedral]].\n\n[[St. Lachtain's Church]], [[Freshford, County Kilkenny|Freshford]] was built in 1731, incorporating a portal from 1100 as its main entrance, all that is left of the original church is the Hiberno-Romanesque (Irish-Roman) architectural porch and doorway. The remainder of the present church was built for Protestant worship in 1731. In St. Lachtains time Freshford was a diocese. In 1225 a bishops palace was built at Aghore (Achadh Ur), now Uppercourt. It was used as a summer residence for over 300 years.\n\n=== Tourist attractions ===\n{{See also|List of tourist attractions in Ireland}}\nIn County Kilkenny [[Jerpoint Abbey]] near [[Thomastown]], [[Kells Priory]] at [[Kells, County Kilkenny|Kells]].

The dialect shared the majority of its features with the surviving dialect of Ring in Co. Waterford. One distinct feature of the traditional Irish of Kilkenny (and Laois) as part of the Ossory dialect region was the pronunciation of [[slender R]] [\u027e\u02b2] as [\u0292\u02b2] like the G in the English word \"regime\". This [\u0292\u02b2] sound was devoiced to an \"sh\" sound when slender R was adjacent to the sound /h/. The Irish language scholar Riste\u00e1rd A. Breatnach wrote an MA thesis entitled \"Kilkenny Irish\" but this remains unpublished.\n\nBaile Sh\u00e9amais, in Glenmore, was home to P\u00e1draig Paor who was the last traditional native speaker of the Irish language in Co. Kilkenny. Audio-recordings were made of his speech in 1936 for the Irish Folklore Commission (Coimisi\u00fan B\u00e9aloideasa \u00c9ireann) by S\u00e9amus \u00d3 Duilearga and Riste\u00e1rd A Breatnach.<ref>\u00d3 h\u00d3g\u00e1in, D\u00e1ith\u00ed, Labhrann Laighnigh, Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, Coisc\u00e9im, 2011</ref> His speech contains the well-documented Ossory pronunciation of [[slender R]] [\u027e\u02b2] as [\u0292\u02b2], resembling the <j> sound of Standard French.\n\n==Economy==\n==== Cooperatives ====\n{{See also|Glanbia|Avonmore (Cooperative)}}\nIn 1966, County Kilkenny village creameries amalgamated to create [[Avonmore (Cooperative)|Avonmore]] Creameries, becoming Avonmore Food plc in 1988.
