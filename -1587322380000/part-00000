It was introduced in 2010 in conjunction with ''[[Pac-Man Championship Edition DX]]'' for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]]. ''[[Galaga Legions DX]]'' was the second game to use the brand, being released in 2011. Two other games were in production under the Namco Generations label, a ''[[Metro-Cross]]'' sequel named ''Aero-Cross'' and a remaster of ''[[Dancing Eyes]]'', both of which were cancelled.\n\nThe Namco Generations brand was conceived and lead by chief producer [[Hideo Yoshizawa]], known as the creator of ''[[Klonoa]]'' and ''[[Mr. Driller]]'', and assisted by Tadashi Iguchi. The idea behind the series was to recreate the healthy proximity between developers and consumers that the original [[Namco]] company had done, and to modernize and garner interest in their older franchises. Each Namco Generations game came with a digital newsletter that provided information on upcoming titles, developer interviews, and gameplay tips. Updates on the project began to slow down as the years progressed, before ultimately being shuttered in late 2012.\n\nPublications have deemed the Namco Generations project as a failure. They considered the company's unusual silence towards it and the general lack of a wider audience to have contributed to its downfall, alongside the two cancelled games being generally unimpressive and not living up to expectations. Both ''Pac-Man Championship Edition DX'' and ''Galaga Legions DX'' remain available on their respective platforms \u2014 the 2013 update to the former, renaming it to ''Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+'', removes all instances of Namco Generations from the game.\n\n==History==\nThe Namco Generations series was lead by chief producer [[Hideo Yoshizawa]].<ref name=\"NG News Special\">{{cite web

It was introduced in 2010 in conjunction with ''[[Pac-Man Championship Edition DX]]'' for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]]. ''[[Galaga Legions DX]]'' was the second game to use the brand, being released in 2011. Two other games were in production under the Namco Generations label, a ''[[Metro-Cross]]'' sequel named ''Aero-Cross'' and a remaster of ''[[Dancing Eyes]]'', both of which were cancelled.\n\nThe Namco Generations brand was conceived and lead by chief producer [[Hideo Yoshizawa]], known as the creator of ''[[Klonoa]]'' and ''[[Mr. Driller]]'', and assisted by Tadashi Iguchi. The idea behind the series was to recreate the healthy proximity between developers and consumers that the original [[Namco]] company had done, and to modernize and garner interest in their older franchises. Each Namco Generations game came with a digital newsletter that provided information on upcoming titles, developer interviews, and gameplay tips. Updates on the project began to slow down as the years progressed, before ultimately being shuttered in late 2012.\n\nPublications have deemed the Namco Generations project as a failure. They considered the company's unusual silence towards it and the general lack of a wider audience to have contributed to its downfall, alongside the two cancelled games being generally unimpressive and not living up to expectations. Both ''Pac-Man Championship Edition DX'' and ''Galaga Legions DX'' remain available on their respective platforms \u2014 the 2013 update to the former, renaming it to ''Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+'', removes all instances of Namco Generations from the game.\n\n==History==\nThe Namco Generations series was lead by chief producer [[Hideo Yoshizawa]].<ref name=\"NG News Special\">{{cite web

First described by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] surgeon and [[zoologist]] [[Andrew Smith (zoologist)|Andrew Smith]] in 1849, it has a slender build with bright green upperparts and yellow-green underparts. The adult female averages around {{convert|2.0|m|ft}} in length, and the male is slightly smaller. \n\nA shy and elusive species, the eastern green mamba is rarely seen. This elusiveness is usually attributed to the species' green colouration which blends with its environment, and its arboreal lifestyle. It has also been observed to use \"sit-and-wait\" or [[Ambush predator|ambush predation]] like many [[viper]]s, unlike the active foraging style typical of other [[Elapidae|elapid]] snakes. The eastern green mamba preys on [[birds]], [[egg]]s, [[bat]]s, and rodents such as mice, rats, and gerbils. \n\nThe eastern green mamba's [[venom]] consists of both [[neurotoxin]]s and [[cardiotoxin]]s. Symptoms of [[envenomation]] include swelling of the bite site, dizziness and nausea, accompanied by difficulty breathing and swallowing, irregular heartbeat and [[convulsions]] progressing to [[respiratory paralysis]]. Bites that produce severe poisoning can be quickly fatal.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe eastern green mamba was first described as ''Naja angusticeps'' by a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] surgeon and zoologist, [[Andrew Smith (zoologist)|Andrew Smith]] in 1849, who reported it from [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] and east to [[Maputo Bay]].<ref name=SmithA>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Andrew |title=Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa, Reptilia.|year=1849 | volume=Volume 4 | at=Plate 70 | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/51564275 | publisher=Smith, Elder and Co.|location=London}}</ref> The [[Species|specific name]] ''angusticeps'' is derived from the Latin word ''angustus'', \"narrow\",<ref name=angustus>{{cite book |title=Etymological Dictionary of Latin and the other Italic Languages |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ecZ1DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA42 | page=42 | first=Michiel | last= de Vaan | publisher=Leiden |location= Boston | origyear= 2008 | year=2018 | isbn=978-90-04-16797-1}}</ref> and ''ceps'', an abbreviated form of ''caput'' (\"head\") when used in a compound word.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Whitmore |title=The principal roots and derivatives of the Latin language, with a display of their incorporation into English |date=1861 |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman & Roberts |location=London |pages=153 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=k9UNAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA153}}</ref> The German-British zoologist [[Albert G\u00fcnther]] described ''Dendroaspis intermedius'' from the [[Zambezi]] River in northern Mozambique in 1865.<ref>{{ cite journal | last=G\u00fcnther | first=Albert | author-link=Albert G\u00fcnther | year=1865 | title=Fourth account of new species of snakes in the collection of the British Museum  | journal=Annals and Magazine of Natural History | series=3rd series | volume=15 | issue=86 | pages=89\u201398 [98] | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/16004402 | doi=10.1080/00222936508681770 }}</ref> This was subsequently [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymised]] with ''D. angusticeps''.<ref name=suricata/> \n\nIn 1896, the Belgian-British zoologist [[George Albert Boulenger]] combined the species ''Dendroaspis angusticeps'' with the [[black mamba]] (''Dendroaspis polylepis''),<ref>{{cite book | title=Catalogue of the snakes in the British Museum (Natural History) | last=Boulenger | first=  George Albert | year= 1896 | publisher=Printed by order of the Trustees British Museum (Natural History).

As well as wild forest habitats, it is also commonly found in thickets and farm trees (such as citrus, mango, coconut, and cashew). In coastal East Africa it is known to enter houses and may even shelter in thatched roof dwellings. Specimens have been found at elevations up to {{convert|1500|m|ft}} above sea level.<ref name=\"S&B95\" />\n\n===Conservation status===\nThe eastern green mamba's conservation status has not been assessed by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). It is a fairly common species of snake throughout its range, and populations are believed to be stable. Large concentrations of two to three individuals per hectare have been documented in coastal Kenya and southern Tanzania, and in one instance a group of five eastern green mambas were seen in a single tree. Although populations of this species are stable overall, [[habitat destruction]] and [[deforestation]] pose a possible threat.<ref name=S&B95/> In South Africa, it is rated as \"vulnerable\" as its habitat is highly fragmented and being transformed into coastal housing developments.<ref name=suricata/>\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Eastern Green Mamba.jpg|right|thumb|A green mamba at a German serpentarium next to shed skin|alt=A bright green snake on a log next to shedded skin]]\nA [[Diurnality|diurnal]] species, the eastern green mamba is active by day and sleeps at night coiled up in foliage or rarely a hollow within the trunk or branch.<ref name=Marais04/><ref name=WCH/> An agile snake and an adept climber, it is not commonly found on the ground though may come down to bask in the morning sun ([[thermoregulation]]).<ref name=S&B95/> In a study of the movement patterns of two adult specimens over a 27-day period, the researcher found their activity range areas to be very low, comparable to other predators who ambush prey rather than actively hunt. This is in contrast to most elapid species, including other mambas, who tend to actively hunt or forage for prey. The study's preliminary evidence sheds some light on this species' method of hunting prey and suggests that it may be an ambush predator due to the sit-and-wait behaviour displayed. This evidence does not preclude active foraging. A specimen systematically hunting a sleeping bat was observed.<ref name=Ang94>{{cite journal|last=Angilletta|first=Michael J.|title=Sedentary behaviors by Green Mambas ''Dendroaspis angusticeps''|journal=Herpetological Natural History|year=1994|volume=2|issue=2|pages=105\u2013111|url=http://angilletta.lab.asu.edu/Publications/Angilletta%201994.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190427/http://angilletta.lab.asu.edu/Publications/Angilletta%201994.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nThere is no evidence that the eastern green mamba migrates.

[[Gravidity and parity|Gravid]] females tend to be sedentary, but males actively search out and court prospective mates during the rainy season\u2014between April and June. Males have been observed engaging in [[agonistic behaviour]] and may fight each other over potential mating opportunities, or possibly to establish a [[dominance hierarchy]]. Typically, a male initiates a fight by moving on top of the other\u2019s body and tongue-flicking, after which the two snakes twine together and push in an attempt to pin each other's head to the ground. Male-male combat can last for several hours, though is less aggressive than commonly seen in the black mamba and combatants do not bite each other.<ref name=H&M89/> \n\nMales locate females by following a scent trail. The male courts the female by aligning his body along the female\u2019s while rapidly tongue-flicking. If the female is receptive to [[mating]], she will lift her tail and cloacal juxtaposition will follow shortly. Courtship and mating take place in the trees, after which the female lays 4\u201317 eggs (an average of 10 to 15 eggs are laid), which occurs in October and November.<ref name=H&M89/> The eggs are small and elongated, usually measuring 47\u201358 x 25\u201328 mm.<ref name=\"FitzSimons70\">{{cite book|last1=FitzSimons|first1=Vivian F.

Documented prey include the [[sombre greenbul]], which occur in dense areas of natural and cultivated vegetation along Kenya's coastline. Ionides and Pitman (1965) reported a large [[bushveld gerbil]] in the stomach of a green mamba in Tanzania.

First described by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] surgeon and [[zoologist]] [[Andrew Smith (zoologist)|Andrew Smith]] in 1849, it has a slender build with bright green upperparts and yellow-green underparts. The adult female averages around {{convert|2.0|m|ft}} in length, and the male is slightly smaller. \n\nA shy and elusive species, the eastern green mamba is rarely seen. This elusiveness is usually attributed to the species' green colouration which blends with its environment, and its arboreal lifestyle. It has also been observed to use \"sit-and-wait\" or [[Ambush predator|ambush predation]] like many [[viper]]s, unlike the active foraging style typical of other [[Elapidae|elapid]] snakes. The eastern green mamba preys on [[birds]], [[egg]]s, [[bat]]s, and rodents such as mice, rats, and gerbils. \n\nThe eastern green mamba's [[venom]] consists of both [[neurotoxin]]s and [[cardiotoxin]]s. Symptoms of [[envenomation]] include swelling of the bite site, dizziness and nausea, accompanied by difficulty breathing and swallowing, irregular heartbeat and [[convulsions]] progressing to [[respiratory paralysis]]. Bites that produce severe poisoning can be quickly fatal.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe eastern green mamba was first described as ''Naja angusticeps'' by a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] surgeon and zoologist, [[Andrew Smith (zoologist)|Andrew Smith]] in 1849, who reported it from [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] and east to [[Maputo Bay]].<ref name=SmithA>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Andrew |title=Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa, Reptilia.|year=1849 | volume=Volume 4 | at=Plate 70 | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/51564275 | publisher=Smith, Elder and Co.|location=London}}</ref> The [[Species|specific name]] ''angusticeps'' is derived from the Latin word ''angustus'', \"narrow\",<ref name=angustus>{{cite book |title=Etymological Dictionary of Latin and the other Italic Languages |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ecZ1DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA42 | page=42 | first=Michiel | last= de Vaan | publisher=Leiden |location= Boston | origyear= 2008 | year=2018 | isbn=978-90-04-16797-1}}</ref> and ''ceps'', an abbreviated form of ''caput'' (\"head\") when used in a compound word.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Whitmore |title=The principal roots and derivatives of the Latin language, with a display of their incorporation into English |date=1861 |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman & Roberts |location=London |pages=153 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=k9UNAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA153}}</ref> The German-British zoologist [[Albert G\u00fcnther]] described ''Dendroaspis intermedius'' from the [[Zambezi]] River in northern Mozambique in 1865.<ref>{{ cite journal | last=G\u00fcnther | first=Albert | author-link=Albert G\u00fcnther | year=1865 | title=Fourth account of new species of snakes in the collection of the British Museum  | journal=Annals and Magazine of Natural History | series=3rd series | volume=15 | issue=86 | pages=89\u201398 [98] | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/16004402 | doi=10.1080/00222936508681770 }}</ref> This was subsequently [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymised]] with ''D. angusticeps''.<ref name=suricata/> \n\nIn 1896, the Belgian-British zoologist [[George Albert Boulenger]] combined the species ''Dendroaspis angusticeps'' with the [[black mamba]] (''Dendroaspis polylepis''),<ref>{{cite book | title=Catalogue of the snakes in the British Museum (Natural History) | last=Boulenger | first=  George Albert | year= 1896 | publisher=Printed by order of the Trustees British Museum (Natural History).

This is in contrast to most elapid species, including other mambas, who tend to actively hunt or forage for prey. The study's preliminary evidence sheds some light on this species' method of hunting prey and suggests that it may be an ambush predator due to the sit-and-wait behaviour displayed. This evidence does not preclude active foraging.

On average, individuals move only about {{convert|5.4|m|ft}} per day.<ref name=H&M89/><ref name=Ang94/> The eastern green mamba generally avoid confrontation with humans or other predators when possible, only biting if pressed.<ref name=\"WCH\"/> \n\n===Reproduction and lifespan===\nThe eastern green mamba is [[Solitary animal|solitary]], except during breeding season. [[Gravidity and parity|Gravid]] females tend to be sedentary, but males actively search out and court prospective mates during the rainy season\u2014between April and June. Males have been observed engaging in [[agonistic behaviour]] and may fight each other over potential mating opportunities, or possibly to establish a [[dominance hierarchy]]. Typically, a male initiates a fight by moving on top of the other\u2019s body and tongue-flicking, after which the two snakes twine together and push in an attempt to pin each other's head to the ground. Male-male combat can last for several hours, though is less aggressive than commonly seen in the black mamba and combatants do not bite each other.<ref name=H&M89/> \n\nMales locate females by following a scent trail. The male courts the female by aligning his body along the female\u2019s while rapidly tongue-flicking. If the female is receptive to [[mating]], she will lift her tail and cloacal juxtaposition will follow shortly. Courtship and mating take place in the trees, after which the female lays 4\u201317 eggs (an average of 10 to 15 eggs are laid), which occurs in October and November.<ref name=H&M89/> The eggs are small and elongated, usually measuring 47\u201358 x 25\u201328 mm.<ref name=\"FitzSimons70\">{{cite book|last1=FitzSimons|first1=Vivian F.

Dobbins]] became the first Buckeye running back to eclipse the 2,000 yard mark, finishing tied atop the Big Ten with Wisconsin's [[Jonathan Taylor (American football)|Jonathan Taylor]] at 2,003 yards and 21 touchdowns. On defense, Ohio State was led by [[Chuck Bednarik Award]], [[Ted Hendricks Award]], and [[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]]-winning defensive end [[Chase Young]], who led the country with 16.5 sacks and also finished in fourth in Heisman Trophy voting. He was joined on the [[2019 College Football All-America Team|first-team All-America]] by cornerback [[Jeff Okudah]]. Head coach Ryan Day was named [[Big Ten Coach of the Year]] by the media, becoming the first Ohio State head coach to win it since [[Earle Bruce]] in [[1979 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1979]].\n\n== Previous season==\nThe [[2018 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Buckeyes]] finished the [[2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2018 season]] 13\u20131, 8\u20131 in [[2018 Big Ten Conference football season|Big Ten play]] to win the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|East division]]. They defeated [[2018 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]] in the [[2018 Big Ten Football Championship Game|Big Ten Championship]] 45\u201324. However, despite a 12\u20131 record, they failed to receive an invitation to the [[College Football Playoff]]. Instead, they received a bid to the [[2019 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] where they defeated [[2018 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] 28\u201323. This was the final season for [[Urban Meyer]] as the Buckeyes' head coach, who coached at Ohio State for seven seasons. In January 2019, it was announced [[University of Georgia|Georgia]] Quarterback [[Justin Fields]] would be transferring to Ohio State.\n\n==Preseason==\n===Spring Game===\nThe 2019 Spring Game was held at Ohio Stadium on April 13, 2019, with the Gray team defeating the Scarlet team, 35\u201317.<ref>{{cite web |title=3 things learned from the Ohio State spring game |url=https://www.landgrantholyland.com/2019/4/13/18309275/ohio-state-spring-game-analysis-justin-fields-matthew-baldwin-garrett-wilson-jahsen-wint |website=www.landgrantholyland.com |publisher=SBNation |accessdate=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!

The Buckeyes found success on the drive and were able to drive 85 yards and score on a 27-yard pass from [[Justin Fields]] to Chris Olave. This score gave the Buckeyes a 10\u20130 lead at halftime.\n\nOhio State received the second-half kick which ended after failing to convert a first down. The Badgers were able to partially block their punt and it only went 13 yards, giving Wisconsin prime field position.

The Buckeyes played their home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. This was the Buckeyes' 130th overall season and 107th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. They were led by [[Ryan Day (American football)|Ryan Day]], in his first season as Ohio State's full-time head coach.\n\nOhio State began the year ranked fifth in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. The Buckeyes climbed to number one in the [[College Football Playoff]] rankings by the end of the regular season, after dominating wins over [[Conference USA]] champion [[2019 Florida Atlantic Owls football team|Florida Atlantic]], [[American Athletic Conference]] runner-up [[2019 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]], and [[Mid-American Conference]] champion [[2019 Miami RedHawks football team|Miami (OH)]] in the non-conference schedule; and comfortable wins over ranked Big Ten teams [[2019 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], [[2019 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], and [[2019 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] in conference play. In the [[2019 Big Ten Championship Game|Big Ten Championship Game]], Ohio State defeated Wisconsin a second time, by a score of 34\u201321 to win their third consecutive conference title. In the final CFP rankings of the season, Ohio State dropped from first to second, passed by SEC champion [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], which placed Ohio State in the [[2019 Fiesta Bowl (December)|Fiesta Bowl]] to play defending national champion and third-seeded [[2019 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]. Ohio State lost that game, 29\u201323, to end the year at 13\u20131.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led on offense by sophomore quarterback [[Justin Fields]], an incoming transfer from [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]] that was granted a waiver for immediate eligibility by the NCAA. He led the Big Ten with 3,273 passing yards and 41 passing touchdowns to go along with 10 rushing touchdowns, and finished third in voting for the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Running back [[J. K. Dobbins]] became the first Buckeye running back to eclipse the 2,000 yard mark, finishing tied atop the Big Ten with Wisconsin's [[Jonathan Taylor (American football)|Jonathan Taylor]] at 2,003 yards and 21 touchdowns. On defense, Ohio State was led by [[Chuck Bednarik Award]], [[Ted Hendricks Award]], and [[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]]-winning defensive end [[Chase Young]], who led the country with 16.5 sacks and also finished in fourth in Heisman Trophy voting. He was joined on the [[2019 College Football All-America Team|first-team All-America]] by cornerback [[Jeff Okudah]]. Head coach Ryan Day was named [[Big Ten Coach of the Year]] by the media, becoming the first Ohio State head coach to win it since [[Earle Bruce]] in [[1979 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1979]].\n\n== Previous season==\nThe [[2018 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Buckeyes]] finished the [[2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2018 season]] 13\u20131, 8\u20131 in [[2018 Big Ten Conference football season|Big Ten play]] to win the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|East division]]. They defeated [[2018 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]] in the [[2018 Big Ten Football Championship Game|Big Ten Championship]] 45\u201324. However, despite a 12\u20131 record, they failed to receive an invitation to the [[College Football Playoff]]. Instead, they received a bid to the [[2019 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] where they defeated [[2018 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] 28\u201323. This was the final season for [[Urban Meyer]] as the Buckeyes' head coach, who coached at Ohio State for seven seasons. In January 2019, it was announced [[University of Georgia|Georgia]] Quarterback [[Justin Fields]] would be transferring to Ohio State.\n\n==Preseason==\n===Spring Game===\nThe 2019 Spring Game was held at Ohio Stadium on April 13, 2019, with the Gray team defeating the Scarlet team, 35\u201317.<ref>{{cite web |title=3 things learned from the Ohio State spring game |url=https://www.landgrantholyland.com/2019/4/13/18309275/ohio-state-spring-game-analysis-justin-fields-matthew-baldwin-garrett-wilson-jahsen-wint |website=www.landgrantholyland.com |publisher=SBNation |accessdate=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!

Defense reigned supreme in the first quarter, as was expected. The Buckeyes were only able to gain 44 yards of total offense while Wisconsin put together 59.

The game was tied at 0\u20130 at the end of the first.\n\nIt wasn't until the 6:56 mark of the second quarter, when Ohio State's Blake Haubeil made a 49-yard field goal, that the stalemate was broken. Ohio State was able to halt Wisconsin's ensuing drive and get the ball back with 2:37 remaining. The Buckeyes found success on the drive and were able to drive 85 yards and score on a 27-yard pass from [[Justin Fields]] to Chris Olave. This score gave the Buckeyes a 10\u20130 lead at halftime.\n\nOhio State received the second-half kick which ended after failing to convert a first down. The Badgers were able to partially block their punt and it only went 13 yards, giving Wisconsin prime field position. In three plays, Wisconsin scored on a 26-yard touchdown pass from [[Jack Coan]] to AJ Taylor, making the score 10\u20137. Following the Wisconsin score, Ohio State would go on to score touchdowns on their next four drives, while Wisconsin would punt twice and fumble twice.
