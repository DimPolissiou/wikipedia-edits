As a subdivision of the [[National Premier Leagues|nationwide NPL]], the league is the highest level within the [[Football Victoria#Soccer pyramid in Victoria|Victorian soccer league system]], serving jointly as the second tier within the overall [[Australian soccer league system|Australian pyramid]].\n\nAdministered by [[Football Victoria]], NPL Victoria is the latest iteration of first division competitions in the state. Historically known as the '''Victorian State League''' and later as the '''Victorian Premier League''', the league was first founded in 1908. It adopted its current branding in 2014, following [[Football Federation Australia]]'s 2012 National Competition Review. \n\nNPL Victoria is contested by 14 clubs. Running from February to September each year, the league sees teams play 26 regular season fixtures, once at home and once away against each other club. The first-placed team at the conclusion of the regular season is termed the \"premier\". The top six-placed clubs then play a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out]] [[playoffs|finals series]], with the winner becoming the \"champion\". The bottom-placed teams operate a system of promotion and relegation with the division below, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. \n\nThe league premier qualifies as Victoria's representative in the [[National Premier Leagues#Competition format##NPL Finals Series|national finals series]], whilst the champion plays against the [[Dockerty Cup]] winner in the [[FV Community Shield]].\n\n==History==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Victorian Premier League 2010.png|thumb|150px|Victorian Premier League logo.]] -->\nThe league commenced in 1909 with [[Carlton United FC|Carlton United]] being the first champions. It has run continuously except for a three season postponement from 1916 to 1918 owing to World War I. After 1945 the league, like fellow state competitions around the country, received a massive boost in numbers and quality with the post-war influx of European migrants, whose dominance was established so effectively that no club which had won the title before 1952, [[Brunswick Juventus|Juventus]]' first title, has won one since.\n\nJuventus would go on to dominate the league in the 1950s, winning six titles, including five in a row from 1952 to 1956. In 1958, after the Victorian Amateur Soccer Federation was formed, the league became known as the Victorian State League. From 1962 until 1976 the league was largely dominated by [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne Hellas]] and [[Footscray JUST]], which won 11 titles between them.\n\nWith creation of the [[National Soccer League]] (NSL) in 1977, the league gradually lost most of its stronger clubs, a trend that reached its peak between 1984 and 1986, when the NSL used a split conference system. After 1987, however, the league slowly started regaining clubs, firstly those discarded when the conference system experiment was abandoned and later when clubs became permanently relegated by the NSL to their respective state leagues. The dominant side during the years from 1977 to 2004 was [[Green Gully Cavaliers|Green Gully]], who won six titles during this period, despite also missing the years 1984\u20131986 from being in the NSL.\n\nIn 1991 the league rebranded again to become the Victorian Premier League and the first finals to determine the champions were staged in 1992, won by the newly promoted [[North Geelong Warriors|North Geelong]]. Following the demise of the NSL in 2004, the remaining two Victorian NSL teams [[Melbourne Knights]] and [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] were granted permission to play in the VPL season of 2005. The league received a major boost at the start of the 2005 season when [[Vodafone]] became major naming rights sponsors, with the competition being renamed the Vodafone Cup. The 2005 season initially saw crowds attending in record numbers to witness the return of old derbies such as that between South Melbourne and [[Heidelberg United]], but with the formation of the A-League filling the void of a national domestic league, 2006 saw a sharp decline in attendances.\n\nThe end of the 2006 season also witnessed a controversial finish to the relegation battle. With three teams finishing on 30 points, [[Sunshine George Cross FC|Sunshine George Cross]] were relegated on goal difference. However, a post-season appeal to the tribunal on the grounds that [[Bulleen Royals|Essendon Royals]] had fielded a suspended player (Ilcho Mladenovski in round 24) saw the Royals deducted a point and relegated. Ultimately, both clubs reprised their position in the following season's competition with the inclusion of the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] evening out the numbers to 16, and as the first part of reforms to the competition set to be brought about in 2008.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Sport experiment was largely derided by the local clubs, and after their removal from the competition in 2008, the league reverted to 12 teams and a Top 5 Finals-Series in 2009. However, the concept of a youth development squad was reintroduced in 2010 with the National Training Centre team playing in midweek fixtures throughout the season but not for competition points. In 2011 the team, mostly comprising players from the [[Melbourne Victory]] youth squad, was renamed Victorian Training Centre Football and was eligible to score competition points for its matches but ineligible to qualify for the finals series or be relegated.\n\nOn 15 September 2013, Victoria Police arrested up to ten people, including [[Southern Stars FC]] players David Obaze, Nicholas McKoy and Joe Woolley as well as the coach, Zaya Younan, for allegations of match fixing. They are expected to be charged with corrupting the outcome of betting.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/victorian-detectives-bust-soccer-matchfixing-syndicate-20130915-2tsh5.html ''The Age'' newspaper]</ref>\n\nIn early 2013, it was announced that Victoria would join the [[National Premier Leagues]], with the Victorian Premier League expected to be rebranded for the 2014 season.<ref name=\"australian-gallop-fa-cup\">{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/football/gallop-aims-for-aussie-fa-cup/story-fn63e0vj-1226577434849 | title=Gallop aims for Aussie FA Cup | work=The Australian | date=14 February 2013 | agency=Australian Associated Press | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"442-seconddivision\">{{cite news | url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/252498,second-division-by-2022.aspx | title=Second Division 'By 2022'? | work=Australian FourFourTwo | date=3 October 2012 | agency=Sportal Australia | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> Although Football Federation Victoria's initial proposal was halted with the announcement of a deferral in November 2013 after several clubs objected to the process for selecting team.

The season is staged during the Australian winter, running from February to September. The league combines aspects of both the traditional European-style [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] and Australian-style [[playoffs|finals series]] within its competition format.  \n===Regular season===\nThe regular season consists of a double [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]]. Each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 26 matches. Teams receive [[three points for a win]], one point for a draw and no points for a loss. The clubs are ranked first based on the number of points acquired during the season. If two teams have an equal number of points, they are separated firstly by [[goal difference]] and then the number of goals scored, calculated across all matches. The Rules of Competition provide head-to-head aggregate and head-to-head [[away goals rule|away goals]] as further tiebreakers if necessary.<ref>https://www.footballvictoria.com.au/sites/ffv/files/2019-02/2019%20Rules%20of%20Competitions%20Mens%20%20Boys%20final.pdf</ref> The team ranked first at the end of the regular season is termed the premiers, and becomes Victoria's entry for the [[National Premier Leagues|national NPL finals]]. \n===Finals series===\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the six highest-ranked clubs qualify for the (Victorian) finals series. The finals take place over three weeks, with teams entering the series based on their respective finishes in the regular season. The teams ranked 3\u20136 enter at the elimination finals stage. The third-ranked team plays the sixth-ranked team, whilst the fourth-ranked team plays the fifth-ranked one. The two winners of the elimination finals meet the teams ranked 1 and 2 in the semi-finals. The premier in the regular season plays the lower-ranked qualifier from the elimination finals, whilst the runner-up plays the higher-ranked qualifier. The finals conclude with the [[grand final]], played between the two winners of the semi-finals. The winner of the grand final is crowned the champions. As all finals matches require a winner, they are all [[single-elimination tournament|knock-out fixtures]]. If a draw occurs at the end of normal time, 30 minutes of [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] are played. A [[penalty shoot-out]] is played if the teams are still drawn.\n\n===Promotion and relegation===\nNPL Victoria also operates a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with the division immediately below it, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. The 13th and 14th-ranked clubs are automatically relegated. From NPL 2, the winners of each of the conferences, East and West, are automatically promoted to replaced the two lowest-ranked NPL clubs. The 12th-ranked NPL club also participates in a single-leg promotion/relegation play-off against an NPL 2 team, with the winner competing in the following year's NPL. The NPL 2 representative in the promotion/relegation play-off is determined by an earlier play-off between the runners-up of the two respective conferences.\n\n==Current clubs==\nThe following clubs are contesting the 2020 NPL Victoria season:\n\n[[Eastern Lions SC|Eastern Lions]] and [[St Albans Saints SC|St Albans]] were promoted from [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]] in 2019 as the champions of the East and West conferences, respectively, while [[Pascoe Vale FC|Pascoe Vale]] and [[Kingston City FC|Kingston City]] were relegated as the two last-placed finishers. [[Dandenong Thunder SC|Dandenong Thunder]] avoided relegation by winning the promotion/relegation play-off against [[FC Bulleen Lions|Bulleen Lions]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne |caption=Locations of 2020 NPL Victoria clubs within metropolitan Melbourne\n| width = 380\n| places =\n {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Avondale FC|Avondale]] \n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37.7626|S|144.8583|E}} }}\n {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Altona Magic SC|Altona]] \n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = top\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|50|48|S|144|51|25|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Bentleigh Greens|Bentleigh]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|58|7|S|145|5|27|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Green Gully SC|Green Gully]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = left\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|43|27|S|144|49|8|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Heidelberg United FC|Heidelberg]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|44|23|S|145|2|3|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Hume City FC|Hume]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = top\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|39|55|S|144|54|58|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Melbourne Knights FC|Knights]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = left\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|45|44|S|144|50|43|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Oakleigh Cannons FC|Oakleigh]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37|54|22|S|145|5|55|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[Eastern Lions SC|Eastern Lions]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37.8585318|S|145.0983669|E}} }} \n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[St Albans Saints SC|St Albans]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{coord|37.7330618|S|144.8119635|E}}  }} \n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = [[Port Melbourne SC|Port Melbourne]]\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = bottom\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|37|49|59.92|S|144|55|44.17|E}} }}\n  {{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[Dandenong Thunder SC|Dandenong Thunder]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|38.0023|S|145.2092|E}} }}\n{{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[Dandenong City SC|Dandenong City]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|37.9599|S|145.2377|E}} }}\n{{Location map~ | Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n  | label = {{nowrap|[[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]]}}\n  | label_size = 56\n  | position = right\n  | background = lightblue\n  | coordinates = {{Coord|37|50|25|S|144|57|54|E}} }}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

As a subdivision of the [[National Premier Leagues|nationwide NPL]], the league is the highest level within the [[Football Victoria#Soccer pyramid in Victoria|Victorian soccer league system]], serving jointly as the second tier within the overall [[Australian soccer league system|Australian pyramid]].\n\nAdministered by [[Football Victoria]], NPL Victoria is the latest iteration of first division competitions in the state. Historically known as the '''Victorian State League''' and later as the '''Victorian Premier League''', the league was first founded in 1908. It adopted its current branding in 2014, following [[Football Federation Australia]]'s 2012 National Competition Review. \n\nNPL Victoria is contested by 14 clubs. Running from February to September each year, the league sees teams play 26 regular season fixtures, once at home and once away against each other club. The first-placed team at the conclusion of the regular season is termed the \"premier\". The top six-placed clubs then play a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out]] [[playoffs|finals series]], with the winner becoming the \"champion\". The bottom-placed teams operate a system of promotion and relegation with the division below, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. \n\nThe league premier qualifies as Victoria's representative in the [[National Premier Leagues#Competition format##NPL Finals Series|national finals series]], whilst the champion plays against the [[Dockerty Cup]] winner in the [[FV Community Shield]].\n\n==History==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Victorian Premier League 2010.png|thumb|150px|Victorian Premier League logo.]] -->\nThe league commenced in 1909 with [[Carlton United FC|Carlton United]] being the first champions. It has run continuously except for a three season postponement from 1916 to 1918 owing to World War I. After 1945 the league, like fellow state competitions around the country, received a massive boost in numbers and quality with the post-war influx of European migrants, whose dominance was established so effectively that no club which had won the title before 1952, [[Brunswick Juventus|Juventus]]' first title, has won one since.\n\nJuventus would go on to dominate the league in the 1950s, winning six titles, including five in a row from 1952 to 1956. In 1958, after the Victorian Amateur Soccer Federation was formed, the league became known as the Victorian State League. From 1962 until 1976 the league was largely dominated by [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne Hellas]] and [[Footscray JUST]], which won 11 titles between them.\n\nWith creation of the [[National Soccer League]] (NSL) in 1977, the league gradually lost most of its stronger clubs, a trend that reached its peak between 1984 and 1986, when the NSL used a split conference system. After 1987, however, the league slowly started regaining clubs, firstly those discarded when the conference system experiment was abandoned and later when clubs became permanently relegated by the NSL to their respective state leagues. The dominant side during the years from 1977 to 2004 was [[Green Gully Cavaliers|Green Gully]], who won six titles during this period, despite also missing the years 1984\u20131986 from being in the NSL.\n\nIn 1991 the league rebranded again to become the Victorian Premier League and the first finals to determine the champions were staged in 1992, won by the newly promoted [[North Geelong Warriors|North Geelong]]. Following the demise of the NSL in 2004, the remaining two Victorian NSL teams [[Melbourne Knights]] and [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]] were granted permission to play in the VPL season of 2005. The league received a major boost at the start of the 2005 season when [[Vodafone]] became major naming rights sponsors, with the competition being renamed the Vodafone Cup. The 2005 season initially saw crowds attending in record numbers to witness the return of old derbies such as that between South Melbourne and [[Heidelberg United]], but with the formation of the A-League filling the void of a national domestic league, 2006 saw a sharp decline in attendances.\n\nThe end of the 2006 season also witnessed a controversial finish to the relegation battle. With three teams finishing on 30 points, [[Sunshine George Cross FC|Sunshine George Cross]] were relegated on goal difference. However, a post-season appeal to the tribunal on the grounds that [[Bulleen Royals|Essendon Royals]] had fielded a suspended player (Ilcho Mladenovski in round 24) saw the Royals deducted a point and relegated. Ultimately, both clubs reprised their position in the following season's competition with the inclusion of the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] evening out the numbers to 16, and as the first part of reforms to the competition set to be brought about in 2008.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Sport experiment was largely derided by the local clubs, and after their removal from the competition in 2008, the league reverted to 12 teams and a Top 5 Finals-Series in 2009. However, the concept of a youth development squad was reintroduced in 2010 with the National Training Centre team playing in midweek fixtures throughout the season but not for competition points. In 2011 the team, mostly comprising players from the [[Melbourne Victory]] youth squad, was renamed Victorian Training Centre Football and was eligible to score competition points for its matches but ineligible to qualify for the finals series or be relegated.\n\nOn 15 September 2013, Victoria Police arrested up to ten people, including [[Southern Stars FC]] players David Obaze, Nicholas McKoy and Joe Woolley as well as the coach, Zaya Younan, for allegations of match fixing. They are expected to be charged with corrupting the outcome of betting.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/victorian-detectives-bust-soccer-matchfixing-syndicate-20130915-2tsh5.html ''The Age'' newspaper]</ref>\n\nIn early 2013, it was announced that Victoria would join the [[National Premier Leagues]], with the Victorian Premier League expected to be rebranded for the 2014 season.<ref name=\"australian-gallop-fa-cup\">{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/football/gallop-aims-for-aussie-fa-cup/story-fn63e0vj-1226577434849 | title=Gallop aims for Aussie FA Cup | work=The Australian | date=14 February 2013 | agency=Australian Associated Press | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"442-seconddivision\">{{cite news | url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/252498,second-division-by-2022.aspx | title=Second Division 'By 2022'? | work=Australian FourFourTwo | date=3 October 2012 | agency=Sportal Australia | accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref> Although Football Federation Victoria's initial proposal was halted with the announcement of a deferral in November 2013 after several clubs objected to the process for selecting team.

The season is staged during the Australian winter, running from February to September. The league combines aspects of both the traditional European-style [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] and Australian-style [[playoffs|finals series]] within its competition format.  \n===Regular season===\nThe regular season consists of a double [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]]. Each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 26 matches. Teams receive [[three points for a win]], one point for a draw and no points for a loss. The clubs are ranked first based on the number of points acquired during the season. If two teams have an equal number of points, they are separated firstly by [[goal difference]] and then the number of goals scored, calculated across all matches. The Rules of Competition provide head-to-head aggregate and head-to-head [[away goals rule|away goals]] as further tiebreakers if necessary.<ref>https://www.footballvictoria.com.au/sites/ffv/files/2019-02/2019%20Rules%20of%20Competitions%20Mens%20%20Boys%20final.pdf</ref> The team ranked first at the end of the regular season is termed the premiers, and becomes Victoria's entry for the [[National Premier Leagues|national NPL finals]]. \n===Finals series===\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the six highest-ranked clubs qualify for the (Victorian) finals series. The finals take place over three weeks, with teams entering the series based on their respective finishes in the regular season. The teams ranked 3\u20136 enter at the elimination finals stage. The third-ranked team plays the sixth-ranked team, whilst the fourth-ranked team plays the fifth-ranked one. The two winners of the elimination finals meet the teams ranked 1 and 2 in the semi-finals. The premier in the regular season plays the lower-ranked qualifier from the elimination finals, whilst the runner-up plays the higher-ranked qualifier. The finals conclude with the [[grand final]], played between the two winners of the semi-finals. The winner of the grand final is crowned the champions. As all finals matches require a winner, they are all [[single-elimination tournament|knock-out fixtures]]. If a draw occurs at the end of normal time, 30 minutes of [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] are played. A [[penalty shoot-out]] is played if the teams are still drawn.\n\n===Promotion and relegation===\nNPL Victoria also operates a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with the division immediately below it, [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]]. The 13th and 14th-ranked clubs are automatically relegated. From NPL 2, the winners of each of the conferences, East and West, are automatically promoted to replaced the two lowest-ranked NPL clubs. The 12th-ranked NPL club also participates in a single-leg promotion/relegation play-off against an NPL 2 team, with the winner competing in the following year's NPL. The NPL 2 representative in the promotion/relegation play-off is determined by an earlier play-off between the runners-up of the two respective conferences.\n\n==Current clubs==\nThe following clubs are contesting the 2020 NPL Victoria season:\n\n[[Eastern Lions SC|Eastern Lions]] and [[St Albans Saints SC|St Albans]] were promoted from [[National Premier Leagues Victoria 2|NPL 2]] in 2019 as the champions of the East and West conferences, respectively, while [[Pascoe Vale FC|Pascoe Vale]] and [[Kingston City FC|Kingston City]] were relegated as the two last-placed finishers.

A member of the [[Yoruba people]], Olatunji was introduced to traditional African music at an early age.  He read in ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' magazine about the [[Rotary International]] Foundation's scholarship program, and applied for it.  He went to the United States of America in 1950.\n\n===Education===\nOlatunji received a Rotary scholarship in 1950 and was educated at [[Morehouse College]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], where he desired to, but never sang in the [[Morehouse College Glee Club]]. Olatunji was a good friend of Glee Club director Dr. Wendell P. Whalum and collaborated with him on a staple of the choir's repertoire, \"Betelehemu\", a Nigerian Christmas carol. After graduating from Morehouse, he went on to [[New York University]] to study public administration. There, he started a small percussion group to earn money on the side while he continued his studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://africanmusic.org/artists/olatunji.html|title=Babatunde Olatunji 1927 \u2013 2003|date=May 2003|publisher=African Music Encyclopedia|accessdate=June 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605084448/http://africanmusic.org/artists/olatunji.html| archivedate= June 5, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Musical career===\nAfter hearing Olatunji perform with the 66 piece Radio City Music Hall orchestra [[Columbia Records]] [[A&R]] man [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] signed Olatunji to the Columbia label in 1957. Two years later he released his first of six records on the Columbia label, called ''[[Drums of Passion (album)|Drums of Passion]]''. ''Drums of Passion'' became a major hit and remains in print; it introduced many Americans to [[world music]]. Drums of Passion also served as the band's name.\n\nOlatunji won a following among [[jazz]] musicians, notably creating a strong relationship with [[John Coltrane]], with whose help he founded the Olatunji Center for African Culture in [[Harlem]]. This was the site of Coltrane's final recorded performance. Coltrane wrote the composition \"Tunji\" on the 1962 album ''[[Coltrane (1962 album)|Coltrane]]'' in dedication to him. Olatunji recorded with many other prominent musicians (often credited as \"Michael Olatunji\"), including [[Cannonball Adderley]] (on his 1961 ''[[African Waltz]]'' album), [[Horace Silver]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Pee Wee Ellis]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Randy Weston]], and with [[Max Roach]] and [[Abbey Lincoln]] on the pivotal ''Freedom Now Suite'' aka ''[[We Insist!]]'', and with [[Grateful Dead]] member [[Mickey Hart]] on his [[Grammy]] winning ''Planet Drum'' projects. He is also mentioned in the lyrics of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"I Shall Be Free\" as recorded on the album ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]''.\n\nIn 1969, [[Carlos Santana]] had a major hit with his cover version of \"[[Jin-go-lo-ba]]\" from Olatunji's first album, which Santana recorded on his debut album, ''[[Santana (1969 album)|Santana]]'', as \"Jingo\".<!--Somebody's got to explain why Aaron Copland is credited on the original album.

His [[Progressivism|progressive]] political beliefs are outlined in ''The Beat of My Drum: An Autobiography'', with a foreword by [[Joan Baez]], ([[Temple University]] Press, 2005). He toured the American south with Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and joined King in the [[march on Washington]].\n\nWhen he performed before the United Nations General Assembly, Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] took off his shoes and danced.

He taught drum and dance workshops year-round starting in the late 1950s. Over the years he presented workshops nationally and internationally at colleges, universities, civic, cultural, and governmental organizations.\n\nHe co-wrote ''Musical Instruments of Africa: Their Nature, Use and Place in the Life of a Deeply Musical People'' with Betty Warner-Dietz (John Day Company, 1965).

He also taught at the [[Esalen Institute]] in California beginning in 1985.\n\n==Last years==\nFor the few years before his death Olatunji made his home at the wild [[Big Sur]] coastline. He became a scholar-in-residence at the [[Esalen Institute]].

A member of the [[Yoruba people]], Olatunji was introduced to traditional African music at an early age.  He read in ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' magazine about the [[Rotary International]] Foundation's scholarship program, and applied for it.  He went to the United States of America in 1950.\n\n===Education===\nOlatunji received a Rotary scholarship in 1950 and was educated at [[Morehouse College]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], where he desired to, but never sang in the [[Morehouse College Glee Club]]. Olatunji was a good friend of Glee Club director Dr. Wendell P. Whalum and collaborated with him on a staple of the choir's repertoire, \"Betelehemu\", a Nigerian Christmas carol. After graduating from Morehouse, he went on to [[New York University]] to study public administration. There, he started a small percussion group to earn money on the side while he continued his studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://africanmusic.org/artists/olatunji.html|title=Babatunde Olatunji 1927 \u2013 2003|date=May 2003|publisher=African Music Encyclopedia|accessdate=June 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605084448/http://africanmusic.org/artists/olatunji.html| archivedate= June 5, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Musical career===\nAfter hearing Olatunji perform with the 66 piece Radio City Music Hall orchestra [[Columbia Records]] [[A&R]] man [[John H.
