{"title_page": "Dealul Mitropoliei", "text_new": "{{short description|heritage site in Bucharest, Romania}}\n'''Dealul Mitropoliei''' ({{IPA-ro|\u02c8de\u032falul mitropo\u02c8li.ej|lang}}, ''Metropolitanate Hill''), also called '''Dealul Patriarhiei''' ({{IPA-ro|\u02c8de\u032falul patriar\u02c8hi.ej|IPA}}, ''Patriarchate Hill''), is a small hill in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]] and an important historic, cultural, architectural, religious and touristic point in the national capital. From a religious point of view, it is one of the centres of [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodoxy]]: the headquarters of the Romanian Patriarchy and the residence of the [[List of Patriarchs of All Romania|Patriarch]] are both located here.\n\nA series of events in the [[history of Romania]] is closely linked to this place, for until 1997, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania]] as well as the [[Great National Assembly]] met in the [[Palace of the Chamber of Deputies]] in the Patriarchal complex. Also here, in the building where the Princely Divan met, [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] was elected prince of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bucuresti sec XIX.jpg|250px|thumb|Bucharest at the beginning of the 19th century. Dealul Mitropoliei is in the centre of the drawing; [[Curtea Ars\u0103]] to the left and [[Radu Vod\u0103 Monastery]] to the right (drawing by R. Bielitz)]]\n\n[[File:Dealul Mitropoliei, 1832, N. Barabas.jpg|250px|thumb|Scene atop the hill from 1832]]\nIn about 1650 the hill was covered in grapevines owned by the country's [[voivode]]s. The monastic complex was surrounded by walls, like a citadel; beginning in 1698, access to the monastery yard was provided by the bell tower built by [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]]. Three stone crosses stood within the yard: one in memory of Metropolitan Teodosie (d. 1708), another in honour of [[Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich|General Miloradovich]] (d. 1825), and one commemorating the 1655 revolt of the ''[[seimen]]i'', during the reign of [[Constantin \u015eerban]], against the [[boyar]]s. The ''seimeni'' were a regiment of 2,000 foreign soldiers, drawn up by the prince, whose mission was to fight in foreign wars. During this revolt Papa Br\u00e2ncoveanu, Constantin's father, was killed. Preda, Papa's father, later assassinated by [[Radu Mihnea]], raised a wooden cross on the spot where his son was killed. Later, one of Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu's sons, Constantin Beizadea, replaced the wooden cross with one of stone, still preserved, with an inscription stating it was built on July 20, 1713.\n\nIn 1859, the election of Alexander John Cuza as prince of Moldavia and Wallachia was greeted with widespread acclaim by the two provinces' inhabitants. However, there existed in Wallachia a conservative movement opposed to Cuza's victory. As the conservatives held a majority in the electoral assembly, the unionists decided to gather together a crowd during the sessions of January 22\u201324, 1859. Over 30,000 people gathered on Dealul Mitropoliei, residents of Bucharest and its surroundings who came in support of Cuza and to keep the legislature under pressure.<ref>http://www.actrus.ro/buletin/2_2003/b1.pdf</ref> Attempting to free the assembly from popular pressure, the Wallachian [[kaymakam|''caimacam'']]'s office decided to move two battalions of troops in the middle of the masses on the hill and to use force to disperse them. Due to pressure from the masses and the desire to avoid a bloodbath, General [[Barbu Vl\u0103doianu]] was compelled to order his troops to return to their barracks. On the evening of January 23 the conservatives realised that they could not depend on the army to sustain their position, so the following day the assembly voted unanimously to support [[Vasile Boerescu]]'s motion that Cuza be proclaimed prince of Moldavia and Wallachia.\n\n==Sites==\n\nThe [[Romanian Patriarchal Cathedral]] is in the centre of the square on the hill. The other buildings are located as follows: to the west, old monastic cells (''chilii''), later transformed into the Patriarchate's offices; to the southeast, the Patriarchal Palace; to the east, the chapel (''paraclis'') and the former Chamber of Deputies; to the north, the bell tower. Booths line the slope of the hill and religious objects such as beeswax candles, prayer books and icons are sold there; the complex is guarded by [[Romanian Army]] soldiers. On major feast days such as [[Easter|Pascha]], dense crowds throng the hill, a practice that did not abate even under the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]].\n\n===Romanian Patriarchal Cathedral===\n[[Image:Bucuresti, Romania (CATEDRALA PATRIARHALA) (fatada) (B-II-m-A-18571.01).jpg|250px|thumb|Romanian Patriarchal Cathedral]]\n[[Image:Mitropolia, 1837, Raffet.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The cathedral in 1837]]\nThe cathedral, dedicated to Saints [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and [[Helena of Constantinople|Helen]], was built between 1654 and 1658 by Constantin \u0218erban and his wife B\u0103la\u0219a, and consecrated under [[Mihnea III]] in 1658. Soon afterwards, the church became Wallachia's metropolitan cathedral. In 1925 the Metropolitanate was elevated to the rank of Patriarchate.\n\nAs is usual for churches of that time and place, the builder's name is unknown. The officials (''dreg\u0103tori'') were [[Logothete|''logof\u0103t'']] Radu Dudescu and Gheorghe Sufariu.\n\nBroadly speaking, the building is a copy of [[Curtea de Arge\u015f Cathedral]]; the cupolas resemble those of [[Neagoe Basarab]]\u2019s church. The cathedral was restored several times (in 1792\u201399, 1834\u201339, 1850, 1886 and 1932\u201335), for which reason the present building is no longer in its original form, various finishing touches and adjustments having been made over time. Inside are the relics of Saint [[Dimitrie Basarabov]] (Dimitrie the New), preserved in a silver coffin, having been brought from [[Bulgaria]] on July 13, 1774.\n\nIt will eventually be replaced as the Patriarchal seat by the [[Romanian People's Salvation Cathedral|People's Salvation Cathedral]].\n\n===Chapel of the Patriarchal Palace===\n\nThe chapel is the most valuable building on Dealul Mitropoliei.<ref>Ionescu, p. 252.</ref> Built in the 17th century along with the palace, the chapel was rebuilt in 1723. Its dedication is found on a [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription inside, painted above the door. The inscription, in verses by the poet [[Dimitrie Notara]], is imprecise: [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos|Nicolae Mavrocordat]] and Metropolitan [[Daniil Topoloveanu]] (1719\u20131731) are presented as being its founders, when in fact they were its restorers.<ref>Ionescu, p. 253.</ref>\n\n===Bell tower=== \nWhen the bell tower (''clopotni\u021ba'') was built, the monastic complex was surrounded by walls, the buildings being located within a yard bounded by these walls. In 1698, Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu ordered the construction of a traditional entrance-gate, that is, in the form of a bell tower. The edifice was restored in 1956\u201358.\n\nIt was beneath this bell tower that [[Barbu Catargiu]], the first [[Prime Minister of Romania]], was assassinated at five o\u2019clock in the evening on June 20, 1862. He had arrived on the hill to give a speech before the Assembly of Deputies, in session in the nearby Palace of the Chamber of Deputies.\n\n===Patriarchal Palace=== \n[[Image:Palatul Patriarhiei - panoramio.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Palace of the Chamber of Deputies]]\nThe building that is today the Patriarchal Palace (''Palatul Patriarhal'') was built under Constantin \u0218erban and was intended to house the monastery's [[starets]]. After 1688, when [[Radu Leon]] named the monastery the country's metropolitan cathedral, the old palace was rebuilt; over time, it was expanded and new wings were added. Between 1932 and 1935 the architect Gheorghe Simotta added a new section to the palace, today its main area, which includes a large throne room, chancelleries, the Patriarch's apartment and several other rooms.\n\nOn the palace walls there is a series of paintings that depicts several scenes in the monastery's history, as well as from Romanian history. The rooms are decorated with paintings and sculptures representing several of the Patriarchate's heads. Inside, expensive vestments and objects used in religious services are displayed in glass cases.\n\n===Palace of the Chamber of Deputies===\n \nThe Palace was built in 1907 after the plans of architect [[Dimitrie Maimarolu]], on the site of the princely divan, itself built where a group of old monastic buildings once were. It is built in a neo-classical style, with an 80-metre fa\u00e7ade, in the centre of which is a [[peristyle]] featuring six [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]]. Inside are bronze and marble busts, as well as paintings, of important political figures from Romania's history. The palace library contains over 11,000 volumes of parliamentary debates, copies of ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'' and similar official publications, and over 7,000 books.<ref>As of 1938, according to Ionescu, p. 256.</ref>\n\nThe building housed the Chamber of Deputies until 1997, when the lower house of [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] moved into the [[Palace of the Parliament]]. Since that year, the Romanian Patriarchate has administered the palace.\n\n==Monuments== \nThe '''Statue of Alexander John Cuza''' was unveiled on March 20, 2004, the 184th anniversary of the subject's birth. [[Ion Iliescu]], [[President of Romania]], performed the unveiling in the presence of other dignitaries, including Prime Minister [[Adrian N\u0103stase]] and Patriarch [[Teoctist Ar\u0103pa\u015fu|Teoctist]].<ref>[http://www.agenda.ro/2004/13-04-sapta.htm agenda.ro]</ref> Paul Vasilescu was the sculptor. Romanian officials regarded the placing of the statue in Bucharest as the righting of an historical error, given that Romania's national capital lacked a statue of the country's first modern ruler.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://ziua.ro/mail.php?id=142514&data=2004-03-22 Statuia lui Cuza, dezvelit\u0103 la Bucure\u015fti\" (\"Cuza's Statue, Unveiled in Bucharest\")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180758/http://ziua.ro/mail.php?id=142514&data=2004-03-22 |date=2007-09-30 }}, ''[[Ziua]]'', March 22, 2004.</ref> Patriarch Teoctist noted that the location chosen was not random, but linked to the fact that it was on Dealul Mitropoliei that Cuza was elected prince.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nUntil 1984, a statue of Barbu Catargiu stood on the hill where he was murdered, as did a [[Capitoline Wolf Statue, Bucharest|Capitoline Wolf Statue]] from 1931 to 1965.\n\n===Sun clock===\n\nThe sun clock (''ceasornicul de soare'') or mid-day cannon (''tunul meridian'') was located on the hill; its exact position is unknown but it was in the vicinity of the bell tower. Placed on Dealul Mitropoliei in 1845, it functioned until the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]], when it was destroyed by an angry populace, together with ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'', which was burned.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Gheorghe Vasilescu, [http://www.crestinortodox.ro/Ceasornicul_de_pe_dealul_Mitropoliei_din_Bucuresti-160-7455.html \"Ceasornicul de soare sau tunul meridian de pe dealul Mitropoliei din Bucure\u015fti\"]</ref>\n\nThe clock's mechanism was fairly simple but ingenious. A sundial was placed on a marble pedestal; the system was based on lenses and a cannon barrel. These two elements were placed such that the sun's rays focused on the lens, after which the resulting solar energy made contact with the cannon's gunpowder. The resulting blast was heard throughout Bucharest, alerting the inhabitants that it was noon. Today only the base survives, although plans for rebuilding the clock were made intermittently during the rest of the 19th century.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n* Ionescu, Grigore.

In Polish, {{lang|pl|Krak\u00f3w}} is an archaic [[possessive case|possessive]] form of ''Krak'' and essentially means \"Krak's (town)\". Krakus's name may derive from \"krakula\", a [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] word<ref name=\"Krak or Krakus?\"/> meaning a judge's staff, or from \"krak\", a Proto-Slavic word meaning an [[oak]], once a [[sacred tree]] most often associated with the concept of [[genealogy]]. The first recorded mention of Prince Krakus (then written as ''Grakch'') dates back to 1190, although the town existed as early as the 7th century, when it was inhabited by the tribe of [[Vistulans]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nThe city's full official name is {{lang|pl|Sto\u0142eczne Kr\u00f3lewskie Miasto Krak\u00f3w}},<ref name=\"bip.krakow-UCHWA\u0141A\"/> which can be translated as \"[[royal city|Royal Capital City]] of Krak\u00f3w\". In English, a person born or living in Krak\u00f3w is a Cracovian ({{lang-pl|krakowianin}}). While in the 1990s the English version of the name was often written Cracow, the most widespread modern English version is Krakow.<ref>[http://krakow.wyborcza.pl/krakow/1,44425,4824554.html?disableRedirects=true Cracow czy Krakow?

On 26 October 1939, the Nazi Regime constructed [[Distrikt Krakau]], one of four total districts within the General Government. On the same day, the city of Krak\u00f3w also became the capital of the administration. The General Government was ruled by [[Hans Frank]] who was based in the city's [[Wawel Castle]]. The Nazis envisioned turning Krak\u00f3w into a completely Germanised city; after removal of all the Jews and Poles, renaming of locations and streets into the German language, and sponsorship of propaganda trying to portray it as a historically German city.<ref>[http://www.tygodnik.com.pl/dodatek-ks/04/sabor.html Cztery miasta w jednym \u2013 nowa historia wojennego Krakowa Niechciana \"stolica\" ] Agnieszka Sabor Tygodnik Powszechny Nr 4 (2794), 26 stycznia 2003</ref> On 28 November 1939 Hans Frank created [[Judenrat|Judenr\u00e4te]] (Jewish Councils) which were to be run by Jewish citizens for the purpose of carrying out orders for the Nazis.

As the city expanded, so too did the architectural achievements of its builders. It is for this reason that the variations in style and urban planning are so easily recognisable.\n\nBuilt from its earliest nucleus outward, and having escaped much of the destruction endured by Poland during the 20th-century wars, Krak\u00f3w's many architectural monuments can typically be seen in historical order by walking from the city centre out, towards its later districts. Krak\u00f3w is one of the few medieval towns in Poland that does not have a historic [[Ratusz]] [[town hall]] in its [[Main Market Square, Krak\u00f3w|Main Square]], because it has not survived the [[Partitions of Poland]].\n\nKrak\u00f3w's historic centre, which includes [[Krak\u00f3w Old Town|the Old Town]], [[Kazimierz]] and the [[Wawel Castle]], was included as the first of its kind on the list of UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s in 1978.<ref name=\"Centre\"/> The ''Stare Miasto'' is the most prominent example of an old town in the country.<ref name=\"Gustafson\"/> For many centuries Krak\u00f3w was [[List of Polish monarchs|the royal]] capital of Poland, until [[Sigismund III Vasa]] relocated the court to [[Warsaw]] in 1596. The whole district is bisected by [[Royal Road, Krak\u00f3w|the Royal Road]], the coronation route traversed by the [[List of Polish monarchs|Kings of Poland]]. The Route begins at [[St. Florian's Church]] outside the northern flank of the old city-walls in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] suburb of Kleparz; passes the [[Krak\u00f3w barbican|Barbican of Krak\u00f3w]] (''Barbakan'') built in 1499, and enters ''Stare Miasto'' through the [[Florian Gate]]. It leads down Floria\u0144ska Street through the Main Square, and up Grodzka to [[Wawel]], the former seat of Polish royalty, overlooking the [[Vistula River|Vistula river]]. Old Town attracts visitors from all over the World. Krak\u00f3w historic centre is one of the 13 places in Poland that are included in the UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. The architectural design of the district had survived all cataclysms of the past and retained its original form coming from the medieval times. The Old Town of Krak\u00f3w is home to about six thousand historic sites and more than two million works of art.<ref name=\"architecture72\"/> Its rich variety of heritage architecture includes Romanesque (e.g., [[St. Andrew's Church, Krak\u00f3w]]), [[Culture of medieval Poland|Gothic]], [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque in Poland|Baroque]] buildings. Krak\u00f3w's palaces, churches, theatres and mansions display great variety of color, architectural details, [[stained glass]], paintings, sculptures, and furnishings.\n\n[[File:Krakow Kanonicza 20070804 1000.jpg|left|thumb|Kanonicza Street, at the foot of the [[Wawel Castle]]]]\n\nIn addition to the old town, the city's district of [[Kazimierz]] is particularly notable for its many renaissance buildings and picturesque streets, as well as the historic Jewish quarter located in the north-eastern part of Kazimierz. Kazimierz was founded in the 14th century to the south-east of the city centre and soon became a wealthy, well-populated area where construction of imposing properties became commonplace. Perhaps the most important feature of medieval Kazimierz was the only major, permanent bridge (''Pons Regalis'') across the northern arm of the Vistula. This natural barrier used to separate Kazimierz from the Old Town for several centuries, while the bridge connected Krak\u00f3w to the [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]] and the lucrative Hungarian trade route. The last structure at this location (at the end of modern Stradom Street) was dismantled in 1880 when the northern arm of the river was filled in with earth and rock, and subsequently built over.<ref name=\"\u015awiszczowski\"/><ref name=\"wandaluzja-1\"/>\n\n[[File:Krak\u00f3w 239a.jpg|thumb|upright=2|View of Krak\u00f3w from St. Mary's Basilica in the Market Square]]\n\nBy the 1930s, Krak\u00f3w had 120 officially [[Synagogues of Krak\u00f3w|registered synagogues]] and prayer houses that spanned across the old city. Much of Jewish intellectual life had moved to new centres like [[Podg\u00f3rze]].<ref name=\"krakow.jewish.org.pl-pdf\"/> This in turn, led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz and the development of new districts in Krak\u00f3w. Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their original form. Some old buildings, however, were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War, and have remained empty. Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993. Kazimierz is now a well-visited area, seeing a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops.\n\n[[File:DZolopa 033 2013.jpg|left|thumb|[[Krak\u00f3w Society of Friends of Fine Arts|Palace of Art]] at Szczepa\u0144ski Square, is an example of [[Art Nouveau]] architecture in central Krak\u00f3w<ref name=\"Palace of Art\"/>]]\n\nAs the city of Krak\u00f3w began to expand further under the rule of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the new architectural styles also developed. Key buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries in Krak\u00f3w include the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts, the directorate of the Polish State Railways as well as the original complex of [[Krak\u00f3w G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station]] and the city's [[Cracow University of Economics|Academy of Economics]]. It was also at around that time that Krak\u00f3w's first radial boulevards began to appear, with the city undergoing a large-scale program aimed at transforming the ancient Polish capital into a sophisticated regional centre of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. New representative government buildings and multi-story tenement houses were built at around that time. Much of the urban-planning beyond the walls of the Old Town was done by Polish architects and engineers trained in [[Vienna]]. Some major projects of the era include the development of the [[Jagiellonian University]]'s new premises and the building of the [[Collegium Novum]] just west of the Old Town. The imperial style planning of the city's further development continued until the return of Poland's independence, following the First World War. Early modernist style in Krak\u00f3w is represented by such masterpieces as [[Krak\u00f3w Society of Friends of Fine Arts|the Palace of Art]] by [[Franciszek M\u0105czy\u0144ski]] and the 'House under the Globe'. [[Vienna Secession#Architecture|Secession style]] architecture, which had arrived in Krak\u00f3w from [[Vienna]], became popular towards the end of [[Partitions of Poland|the Partitions]].<ref name=\"Strasz\"/>\n\n[[File:Basztowa Ur.Woj i NBP, Krakow.jpg|upright|thumb|''Basztowa Street'', filled with some of the most unique historical buildings in all architectural styles; part of the [[Royal Road, Krak\u00f3w|Royal Route of Krak\u00f3w]]]]\nWith Poland's regained independence came the major change in the fortunes of Krak\u00f3w\u2014now the second most important city of a sovereign nation. The state began to make new plans for the city development and commissioned a number of representative buildings. The predominant style for new projects was modernism with various interpretations of the art-deco style.<ref name=\"Vogt-Nassery\"/> Important buildings constructed in the style of [[Polish modernism]] include the Feniks 'LOT' building on Basztowa Street, the Feniks department store on the [[Main Market Square, Krak\u00f3w|Main Square]] and the Municipal Savings Bank on Szczepa\u0144ski Square. The J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski house is also of note as a particularly good example of interwar architecture in the city.<ref name=\"Krak\u00f3w, Oleandry \u2013 Dom im. J\u00f3zefa Pi\u0142sudskiego\"/>\n\nAfter the Second World War, new government turned toward Soviet influence and the [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist monumentalism]]. The doctrine of [[Socialist realism in Poland]], as in other countries of the [[People's Republic]]s, was enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of art, but its most spectacular achievements were made in the field of urban design. The guidelines for this new trend were spelled-out in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects. Architecture was to become a weapon in establishing the new social order by the communists.<ref name=\"inyourpocket/sightseeing\">{{cite web|url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/poland/krakow/sightseeing/Nowa-Huta|title=Nowa Huta \u2013 Sightseeing in Krak\u00f3w \u2013 In Your Pocket city guide \u2013 essential travel guides to cities in Poland|publisher=Inyourpocket.com|accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref> The ideological impact of urban design was valued more than aesthetics.

However, in the course of incorporating the principles of Socialist realism, there were quite a few deviations introduced by the communists.

In Polish, {{lang|pl|Krak\u00f3w}} is an archaic [[possessive case|possessive]] form of ''Krak'' and essentially means \"Krak's (town)\". Krakus's name may derive from \"krakula\", a [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] word<ref name=\"Krak or Krakus?\"/> meaning a judge's staff, or from \"krak\", a Proto-Slavic word meaning an [[oak]], once a [[sacred tree]] most often associated with the concept of [[genealogy]]. The first recorded mention of Prince Krakus (then written as ''Grakch'') dates back to 1190, although the town existed as early as the 7th century, when it was inhabited by the tribe of [[Vistulans]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nThe city's full official name is {{lang|pl|Sto\u0142eczne Kr\u00f3lewskie Miasto Krak\u00f3w}},<ref name=\"bip.krakow-UCHWA\u0141A\"/> which can be translated as \"[[royal city|Royal Capital City]] of Krak\u00f3w\". In English, a person born or living in Krak\u00f3w is a Cracovian ({{lang-pl|krakowianin}}). While in the 1990s the English version of the name was often written Cracow, the most widespread modern English version is Krakow.<ref>[http://krakow.wyborcza.pl/krakow/1,44425,4824554.html?disableRedirects=true Cracow czy Krakow?

On 26 October 1939, the Nazi Regime constructed [[Distrikt Krakau]], one of four total districts within the General Government. On the same day, the city of Krak\u00f3w also became the capital of the administration. The General Government was ruled by [[Hans Frank]] who was based in the city's [[Wawel Castle]]. The Nazis envisioned turning Krak\u00f3w into a completely Germanised city; after removal of all the Jews and Poles, renaming of locations and streets into the German language, and sponsorship of propaganda trying to portray it as a historically German city.<ref>[http://www.tygodnik.com.pl/dodatek-ks/04/sabor.html Cztery miasta w jednym \u2013 nowa historia wojennego Krakowa Niechciana \"stolica\" ] Agnieszka Sabor Tygodnik Powszechny Nr 4 (2794), 26 stycznia 2003</ref> On 28 November 1939 Hans Frank created [[Judenrat|Judenr\u00e4te]] (Jewish Councils) which were to be run by Jewish citizens for the purpose of carrying out orders for the Nazis.

Initially, most ghettos were open and Jews were allowed to enter and exit freely.  However, with time ghettos were generally closed and security became tighter.

As the city expanded, so too did the architectural achievements of its builders. It is for this reason that the variations in style and urban planning are so easily recognisable.\n\nBuilt from its earliest nucleus outward, and having escaped much of the destruction endured by Poland during the 20th-century wars, Krak\u00f3w's many architectural monuments can typically be seen in historical order by walking from the city centre out, towards its later districts. Krak\u00f3w is one of the few medieval towns in Poland that does not have a historic [[Ratusz]] [[town hall]] in its [[Main Market Square, Krak\u00f3w|Main Square]], because it has not survived the [[Partitions of Poland]].\n\nKrak\u00f3w's historic centre, which includes [[Krak\u00f3w Old Town|the Old Town]], [[Kazimierz]] and the [[Wawel Castle]], was included as the first of its kind on the list of UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s in 1978.<ref name=\"Centre\"/> The ''Stare Miasto'' is the most prominent example of an old town in the country.<ref name=\"Gustafson\"/> For many centuries Krak\u00f3w was [[List of Polish monarchs|the royal]] capital of Poland, until [[Sigismund III Vasa]] relocated the court to [[Warsaw]] in 1596. The whole district is bisected by [[Royal Road, Krak\u00f3w|the Royal Road]], the coronation route traversed by the [[List of Polish monarchs|Kings of Poland]]. The Route begins at [[St. Florian's Church]] outside the northern flank of the old city-walls in the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] suburb of Kleparz; passes the [[Krak\u00f3w barbican|Barbican of Krak\u00f3w]] (''Barbakan'') built in 1499, and enters ''Stare Miasto'' through the [[Florian Gate]]. It leads down Floria\u0144ska Street through the Main Square, and up Grodzka to [[Wawel]], the former seat of Polish royalty, overlooking the [[Vistula River|Vistula river]]. Old Town attracts visitors from all over the World. Krak\u00f3w historic centre is one of the 13 places in Poland that are included in the UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. The architectural design of the district had survived all cataclysms of the past and retained its original form coming from the medieval times. The Old Town of Krak\u00f3w is home to about six thousand historic sites and more than two million works of art.<ref name=\"architecture72\"/> Its rich variety of heritage architecture includes Romanesque (e.g., [[St. Andrew's Church, Krak\u00f3w]]), [[Culture of medieval Poland|Gothic]], [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque in Poland|Baroque]] buildings. Krak\u00f3w's palaces, churches, theatres and mansions display great variety of color, architectural details, [[stained glass]], paintings, sculptures, and furnishings.\n\n[[File:Krakow Kanonicza 20070804 1000.jpg|left|thumb|Kanonicza Street, at the foot of the [[Wawel Castle]]]]\n\nIn addition to the old town, the city's district of [[Kazimierz]] is particularly notable for its many renaissance buildings and picturesque streets, as well as the historic Jewish quarter located in the north-eastern part of Kazimierz. Kazimierz was founded in the 14th century to the south-east of the city centre and soon became a wealthy, well-populated area where construction of imposing properties became commonplace. Perhaps the most important feature of medieval Kazimierz was the only major, permanent bridge (''Pons Regalis'') across the northern arm of the Vistula. This natural barrier used to separate Kazimierz from the Old Town for several centuries, while the bridge connected Krak\u00f3w to the [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]] and the lucrative Hungarian trade route. The last structure at this location (at the end of modern Stradom Street) was dismantled in 1880 when the northern arm of the river was filled in with earth and rock, and subsequently built over.<ref name=\"\u015awiszczowski\"/><ref name=\"wandaluzja-1\"/>\n\n[[File:Krak\u00f3w 239a.jpg|thumb|upright=2|View of Krak\u00f3w from St. Mary's Basilica in the Market Square]]\n\nBy the 1930s, Krak\u00f3w had 120 officially [[Synagogues of Krak\u00f3w|registered synagogues]] and prayer houses that spanned across the old city. Much of Jewish intellectual life had moved to new centres like [[Podg\u00f3rze]].<ref name=\"krakow.jewish.org.pl-pdf\"/> This in turn, led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz and the development of new districts in Krak\u00f3w. Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their original form. Some old buildings, however, were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War, and have remained empty. Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993. Kazimierz is now a well-visited area, seeing a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops.\n\n[[File:DZolopa 033 2013.jpg|left|thumb|[[Krak\u00f3w Society of Friends of Fine Arts|Palace of Art]] at Szczepa\u0144ski Square, is an example of [[Art Nouveau]] architecture in central Krak\u00f3w<ref name=\"Palace of Art\"/>]]\n\nAs the city of Krak\u00f3w began to expand further under the rule of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the new architectural styles also developed. Key buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries in Krak\u00f3w include the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts, the directorate of the Polish State Railways as well as the original complex of [[Krak\u00f3w G\u0142\u00f3wny railway station]] and the city's [[Cracow University of Economics|Academy of Economics]]. It was also at around that time that Krak\u00f3w's first radial boulevards began to appear, with the city undergoing a large-scale program aimed at transforming the ancient Polish capital into a sophisticated regional centre of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. New representative government buildings and multi-story tenement houses were built at around that time. Much of the urban-planning beyond the walls of the Old Town was done by Polish architects and engineers trained in [[Vienna]]. Some major projects of the era include the development of the [[Jagiellonian University]]'s new premises and the building of the [[Collegium Novum]] just west of the Old Town. The imperial style planning of the city's further development continued until the return of Poland's independence, following the First World War. Early modernist style in Krak\u00f3w is represented by such masterpieces as [[Krak\u00f3w Society of Friends of Fine Arts|the Palace of Art]] by [[Franciszek M\u0105czy\u0144ski]] and the 'House under the Globe'. [[Vienna Secession#Architecture|Secession style]] architecture, which had arrived in Krak\u00f3w from [[Vienna]], became popular towards the end of [[Partitions of Poland|the Partitions]].<ref name=\"Strasz\"/>\n\n[[File:Basztowa Ur.Woj i NBP, Krakow.jpg|upright|thumb|''Basztowa Street'', filled with some of the most unique historical buildings in all architectural styles; part of the [[Royal Road, Krak\u00f3w|Royal Route of Krak\u00f3w]]]]\nWith Poland's regained independence came the major change in the fortunes of Krak\u00f3w\u2014now the second most important city of a sovereign nation. The state began to make new plans for the city development and commissioned a number of representative buildings. The predominant style for new projects was modernism with various interpretations of the art-deco style.<ref name=\"Vogt-Nassery\"/> Important buildings constructed in the style of [[Polish modernism]] include the Feniks 'LOT' building on Basztowa Street, the Feniks department store on the [[Main Market Square, Krak\u00f3w|Main Square]] and the Municipal Savings Bank on Szczepa\u0144ski Square. The J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski house is also of note as a particularly good example of interwar architecture in the city.<ref name=\"Krak\u00f3w, Oleandry \u2013 Dom im. J\u00f3zefa Pi\u0142sudskiego\"/>\n\nAfter the Second World War, new government turned toward Soviet influence and the [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist monumentalism]]. The doctrine of [[Socialist realism in Poland]], as in other countries of the [[People's Republic]]s, was enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of art, but its most spectacular achievements were made in the field of urban design. The guidelines for this new trend were spelled-out in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects. Architecture was to become a weapon in establishing the new social order by the communists.<ref name=\"inyourpocket/sightseeing\">{{cite web|url=http://www.inyourpocket.com/poland/krakow/sightseeing/Nowa-Huta|title=Nowa Huta \u2013 Sightseeing in Krak\u00f3w \u2013 In Your Pocket city guide \u2013 essential travel guides to cities in Poland|publisher=Inyourpocket.com|accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref> The ideological impact of urban design was valued more than aesthetics. It aimed at expressing persistence and power. This form of architecture was implemented in the new industrial district of Nowa Huta with apartment blocks constructed according to a Stalinist blueprint, with repetitious courtyards and wide, tree-lined avenues.<ref name=\"Nh.pl-1\"/>\n\n[[File:Pawilon Wyspia\u0144ski 2000, Krak\u00f3w.JPG|left|thumb|Pawilon Wyspia\u0144ski 2000 is a rare piece of [[Postmodern architecture]] present in Krak\u00f3w's ''Old Town''<ref name=\"sztuka-architektury1\"/>]]\n\nSince the style of the [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]] was generally regarded as the most revered in old Polish architecture, it was also used for augmenting Poland's [[Socialist realism in Poland|Socialist national]] format. However, in the course of incorporating the principles of Socialist realism, there were quite a few deviations introduced by the communists. One of these was to more closely reflect Soviet architecture, which resulted in the majority of works blending into one another. From 1953, critical opinions in the Party were increasingly frequent, and the doctrine was given up in 1956 marking the end of [[Stalinism in Poland|Stalinism]].<ref name=\"SOCREALIZM in Poland (1949\u20131955)\"/> The [[socrealism|soc-realist]] centre of Nowa Huta is considered to be a meritorious monument of the times. This period in postwar architecture was followed by the mass-construction of large [[Plattenbau|Panel System]] apartment blocks, most of which were built outside the city centre and thus do not encroach upon the beauty of the old or new towns. Some examples of the new style (e.g., Hotel Cracovia) recently listed as heritage monuments were built during the latter half of the 20th century in Krak\u00f3w.<ref name=\"naszemiasto-cracovia\"/>\n\nAfter the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the birth of the [[Third Polish Republic|Third Republic]] in the latter half of the 20th century, a number of new architectural projects were completed, including the construction of large business parks and commercial facilities such as the [[Galeria Krakowska]], or infrastructure investments like the [[Tramways in Krak\u00f3w#Krak\u00f3w Fast Tram|Krak\u00f3w Fast Tram]]. A good example of this would be the 2007-built ''Pawilon Wyspia\u0144ski 2000'',<ref name=\"sztuka-architektury1\"/> which is used as a multi-purpose information and exhibition space, or the Ma\u0142opolski Garden of Arts (''[[:pl:Ma\u0142opolski Ogr\u00f3d Sztuki w Krakowie|Ma\u0142opolski Ogr\u00f3d Sztuki]]''), a multi-purpose exhibition and theatre complex located in the historic Old Town.<ref>Ma\u0142opolski Regionalny Program Operacyjny, [http://www.slowacki.krakow.pl/pl/aktualnosci/malopolski_ogrod_sztuki/ Budowa Ma\u0142opolskiego Ogrodu Sztuki w Krakowie.] Teatr im.

External 3.5-in [[floppy drive]]s are also fairly common, following a trend to not integrate floppy drives into compact and [[laptop]] computers. Pre-built external drives are available through all major manufacturers of hard drives, as well as several third parties.\n\nThese may also be referred to as a '''caddy'''&nbsp;\u2013 a sheath, typically plastic or metallic, within which a [[hard disk drive]] can be placed and connected with the same type of adapters as a conventional motherboard and power supply would use. The exterior of the caddy typically has two female sockets, used for data transfer and power.\n[[File:External hdd principle wiring diagram.svg|thumb|Simplified circuit diagrams of harddiskdrive enclosure.]]\n\nVariants of caddy:<ref>{{cite web|author=Maris|title=External Disk Enclosures and Caddies|url=https://hddmag.com/2016/01/external-disk-enclosures.html|website=HDDMag|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n* some larger caddies can support several devices at once and can feature either separate outputs to connect each device to a different computer, or a single output to connect both over the same data cable\n* certain caddies don't require a power supply, instead depending for power on the computer to which they are connected\n* some caddies have integrated fans with which to keep the drives within at a cool temperature\n* caddies for all major standards exist, supporting for example [[AT Attachment|ATA]], [[SCSI]] and [[SATA]] drives and [[USB]], SCSI and [[FireWire]] outputs\n\nAdvantages:\n* relatively high transfer speed; typically faster than other common portable media such as CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives, slower than drives connected using solely ATA, SCSI and SATA connectors\n* storage; typically larger than [[CD]]s, [[DVD]]s and [[USB flash drive]]s\n* price-to-storage ratio; typically better than CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives\n\nDisadvantages:\n* power; most variants require a supply, unlike CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives...\n* size; typically larger than CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives\n\n==Form factors==<!-- See hard disk drives#Form factors for refs -->\n[[Image:Buffalo HD-H250U2.jpg|thumb|250px|Factory-assembled [[Melco|Buffalo]] external hard drive in a disk enclosure]]\n* ''Multiple drives:'' RAID-enabled enclosures and iSCSI enclosures commonly hold multiple drives. High-end and server-oriented chassis are often built around 3.5-in drives in hot-swappable drive caddies.\n* ''\"5.25-inch\" drive:'' (5.75 in \u00d7 8 in \u00d7 1.63 in = 146.1&nbsp;mm \u00d7 203&nbsp;mm \u00d7 41.4&nbsp;mm)<br/>Most desktop models of drives for optical 120-mm discs ([[DVD-ROM]] or [[CD-ROM]] drives, [[CD burner|CD]] or [[DVD burner]]s), are designed to be mounted into a so-called \"5.25-inch slot\", which obtained its nickname because this slot size was initially used by drives for {{convert|5.25|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[floppy disk]]s in the [[IBM PC AT]]. (The original \"5.25-inch  slot\" in the [[IBM PC]] was with 3.25 in (82.6&nbsp;mm) twice as high as the one commonly used today; in fact, the PC's drive size was called \"5.25-inch full-height\", and the size used in the PC AT and commonly used today is \"5.25-inch half-height\".)\n* ''\"3.5-inch\" drive:'' (4 in \u00d7 5.75 in \u00d7 1 in = 101.6&nbsp;mm \u00d7 146.05&nbsp;mm \u00d7 25.4&nbsp;mm)<br/> This smaller, {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} disk-drive form factor was introduced with the [[Apple Macintosh]] series in 1984, and later adopted throughout the industry beginning widely with the [[IBM PS/2]] series in 1987, which included drives of this size for 90-mm (\"3.5-inch\") floppy disks. This form factor is today used by most desktop hard drives. They usually have 10 mounting holes with American [[Unified Thread Standard|6-32 UNC 2B]] threads: three on each side and four on the bottom.\n* ''\"2.5-inch\" drive:'' (2.75 in \u00d7 3.945 in \u00d7 0.374 in = 69.85&nbsp;mm \u00d7 100.2&nbsp;mm \u00d7 9.5&nbsp;mm)<br/>This even smaller, {{convert|2.75|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} form factor is widely used today in notebook computers and similar small-footprint devices. One commonplace feature for these drives is radically lower power consumption than is found in larger drives. This enables enclosure vendors to power the devices directly from the host device's USB or other external bus, in most cases.\n*  ''\"1.8-inch\" drive:'' Found in extremely compact devices, such as certain portable media players and smaller notebooks, these devices are not standardized like their 2.5&nbsp;inch cousins.\nA range of other form factors has emerged for mobile devices. While laptop hard drives are today generally of the 9.5&nbsp;mm high variant of the \"2.5-inch\" drive form factor, older laptops and notebooks had hard drives that varied in height, which can make it difficult to find a well-fitting chassis.  Laptop optical drives require \"slim\" 5.25-in enclosures, since they have approximately half the thickness of their desktop counterparts, and most models use a special 50-pin connector that differs from the 40-pin connectors used on desktop [[AT Attachment|ATA]] drives.\n\nWhile they are less common now than they once were, it is also possible to purchase a drive chassis and mount that will convert a 3.5-inch hard drive into a removable hard disk that can be plugged into and removed from a mounting bracket permanently installed in a desktop PC case.  The mounting bracket carries the data bus and power connections over a proprietary connector, and converts back into the drive's native data bus format and power connections inside the drive's chassis.\n\n==Enterprise enclosures==\nIn [[enterprise storage]] the term refers to a larger physical chassis. The term can be used both in reference to network-attached storage (NAS)<ref name=InfoworldSun /> and components of a [[storage area network]] (SAN) or be used to describe a chassis directly attached to one or more servers over an external bus. Like their conventional server brethren, these devices may include a [[backplane]], [[temperature]] [[sensors]], cooling systems, enclosure management devices, and redundant [[power supplies]].\n\n==Connections==\n[[Image:HDDCaddyEsata.JPG|thumb|An eSATA and Mini USB hard disk enclosure board]]\n[[Image:ESATACASE.JPG|thumb|Multiple connectors including external power on a 2.5 inch enclosure]]\n[[Image:HDDEControler.JPG|thumb|The [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] of an enclosure controls the data transfer, generic mass storage device drivers are readily available on most operating systems]]\n[[Image:HDDCaddy.JPG|thumb|This 2.5 inch caddy uses a single connector mini USB]]\n\n===Native drive interfaces===\n{{main|Direct Attached Storage}}\n[[SCSI]], [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]], [[Fibre Channel]], [[eSATAp]], and [[eSATA]] interfaces can be used to directly connect the external hard drive to an internal [[host adapter]], without the need for any intervening controller.  External variants of these native drive [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]] are extremely similar to the internal protocols, but are often expanded to carry power (such as eSATAp and the SCSI [[Single Connector Attachment]]) and to use a more durable physical connector. A [[host adapter]] with external port may be necessary to connect a drive, if a computer lacks an available external port.\n\n===Direct attach serial interfaces===\n[[USB]] or [[FireWire]] connections are typically used to attach consumer class external hard drives to a computer. Unlike SCSI, eSATA, or SAS these require circuitry to convert the hard disk's native signal to the appropriate protocol. [[AT Attachment|Parallel ATA]] and internal Serial ATA hard disks are frequently connected to such chassis because nearly all computers on the market today have USB or FireWire ports, and these chassis are inexpensive and easy to find.\n\n===Network protocols===\n{{main|Network-attached storage}}\n[[iSCSI]], [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]], or [[CIFS]] are all commonly used protocols that are used to allow an external hard drive to use a network to send data to a computer system. This type of external hard drive is also known as [[Network-attached storage]] or NAS.  Often, such drives are [[embedded computer]]s running operating systems such as [[Linux]] or [[VxWorks]] that use their [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] daemons and [[SAMBA]] to provide a networked file system. A newer technology NAS, has been applied to some disk enclosures, which allows network ability, direct connection (e.g., USB) and even RAID features.\n\n== Hard drive shucking ==\n\"Shucking\" refers to the process of purchasing an external hard disk drive and removing the drive from its enclosure, in order for it to be used as an internal disk drive. This is performed because external drives are often cheaper than internal drives of the same capacity and model, and that external drives designed for continuous usage often contain hard drives designed for increased reliability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/324769/how-to-get-premium-hard-drives-for-cheap-by-shucking-external-drives/|title=How to Get Premium Hard Drives for Cheap by \"Shucking\" External Drives|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Jason|website=How-To Geek|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the hard disk drive shortages caused by the [[2011 Thailand floods]], data storage company [[Backblaze]] reduced its cost of acquiring hard drives by purchasing external hard drives and shucking them.

External 3.5-in [[floppy drive]]s are also fairly common, following a trend to not integrate floppy drives into compact and [[laptop]] computers. Pre-built external drives are available through all major manufacturers of hard drives, as well as several third parties.\n\nThese may also be referred to as a '''caddy'''&nbsp;\u2013 a sheath, typically plastic or metallic, within which a [[hard disk drive]] can be placed and connected with the same type of adapters as a conventional motherboard and power supply would use. The exterior of the caddy typically has two female sockets, used for data transfer and power.\n[[File:External hdd principle wiring diagram.svg|thumb|Simplified circuit diagrams of harddiskdrive enclosure.]]\n\nVariants of caddy:<ref>{{cite web|author=Maris|title=External Disk Enclosures and Caddies|url=https://hddmag.com/2016/01/external-disk-enclosures.html|website=HDDMag|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>\n* some larger caddies can support several devices at once and can feature either separate outputs to connect each device to a different computer, or a single output to connect both over the same data cable\n* certain caddies don't require a power supply, instead depending for power on the computer to which they are connected\n* some caddies have integrated fans with which to keep the drives within at a cool temperature\n* caddies for all major standards exist, supporting for example [[AT Attachment|ATA]], [[SCSI]] and [[SATA]] drives and [[USB]], SCSI and [[FireWire]] outputs\n\nAdvantages:\n* relatively high transfer speed; typically faster than other common portable media such as CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives, slower than drives connected using solely ATA, SCSI and SATA connectors\n* storage; typically larger than [[CD]]s, [[DVD]]s and [[USB flash drive]]s\n* price-to-storage ratio; typically better than CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives\n\nDisadvantages:\n* power; most variants require a supply, unlike CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives...\n* size; typically larger than CDs, DVDs and USB flash drives\n\n==Form factors==<!-- See hard disk drives#Form factors for refs -->\n[[Image:Buffalo HD-H250U2.jpg|thumb|250px|Factory-assembled [[Melco|Buffalo]] external hard drive in a disk enclosure]]\n* ''Multiple drives:'' RAID-enabled enclosures and iSCSI enclosures commonly hold multiple drives. High-end and server-oriented chassis are often built around 3.5-in drives in hot-swappable drive caddies.\n* ''\"5.25-inch\" drive:'' (5.75 in \u00d7 8 in \u00d7 1.63 in = 146.1&nbsp;mm \u00d7 203&nbsp;mm \u00d7 41.4&nbsp;mm)<br/>Most desktop models of drives for optical 120-mm discs ([[DVD-ROM]] or [[CD-ROM]] drives, [[CD burner|CD]] or [[DVD burner]]s), are designed to be mounted into a so-called \"5.25-inch slot\", which obtained its nickname because this slot size was initially used by drives for {{convert|5.25|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[floppy disk]]s in the [[IBM PC AT]]. (The original \"5.25-inch  slot\" in the [[IBM PC]] was with 3.25 in (82.6&nbsp;mm) twice as high as the one commonly used today; in fact, the PC's drive size was called \"5.25-inch full-height\", and the size used in the PC AT and commonly used today is \"5.25-inch half-height\".)\n* ''\"3.5-inch\" drive:'' (4 in \u00d7 5.75 in \u00d7 1 in = 101.6&nbsp;mm \u00d7 146.05&nbsp;mm \u00d7 25.4&nbsp;mm)<br/> This smaller, {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} disk-drive form factor was introduced with the [[Apple Macintosh]] series in 1984, and later adopted throughout the industry beginning widely with the [[IBM PS/2]] series in 1987, which included drives of this size for 90-mm (\"3.5-inch\") floppy disks. This form factor is today used by most desktop hard drives. They usually have 10 mounting holes with American [[Unified Thread Standard|6-32 UNC 2B]] threads: three on each side and four on the bottom.\n* ''\"2.5-inch\" drive:'' (2.75 in \u00d7 3.945 in \u00d7 0.374 in = 69.85&nbsp;mm \u00d7 100.2&nbsp;mm \u00d7 9.5&nbsp;mm)<br/>This even smaller, {{convert|2.75|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} form factor is widely used today in notebook computers and similar small-footprint devices. One commonplace feature for these drives is radically lower power consumption than is found in larger drives. This enables enclosure vendors to power the devices directly from the host device's USB or other external bus, in most cases.\n*  ''\"1.8-inch\" drive:'' Found in extremely compact devices, such as certain portable media players and smaller notebooks, these devices are not standardized like their 2.5&nbsp;inch cousins.\nA range of other form factors has emerged for mobile devices. While laptop hard drives are today generally of the 9.5&nbsp;mm high variant of the \"2.5-inch\" drive form factor, older laptops and notebooks had hard drives that varied in height, which can make it difficult to find a well-fitting chassis.  Laptop optical drives require \"slim\" 5.25-in enclosures, since they have approximately half the thickness of their desktop counterparts, and most models use a special 50-pin connector that differs from the 40-pin connectors used on desktop [[AT Attachment|ATA]] drives.\n\nWhile they are less common now than they once were, it is also possible to purchase a drive chassis and mount that will convert a 3.5-inch hard drive into a removable hard disk that can be plugged into and removed from a mounting bracket permanently installed in a desktop PC case.  The mounting bracket carries the data bus and power connections over a proprietary connector, and converts back into the drive's native data bus format and power connections inside the drive's chassis.\n\n==Enterprise enclosures==\nIn [[enterprise storage]] the term refers to a larger physical chassis. The term can be used both in reference to network-attached storage (NAS)<ref name=InfoworldSun /> and components of a [[storage area network]] (SAN) or be used to describe a chassis directly attached to one or more servers over an external bus. Like their conventional server brethren, these devices may include a [[backplane]], [[temperature]] [[sensors]], cooling systems, enclosure management devices, and redundant [[power supplies]].\n\n==Connections==\n[[Image:HDDCaddyEsata.JPG|thumb|An eSATA and Mini USB hard disk enclosure board]]\n[[Image:ESATACASE.JPG|thumb|Multiple connectors including external power on a 2.5 inch enclosure]]\n[[Image:HDDEControler.JPG|thumb|The [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] of an enclosure controls the data transfer, generic mass storage device drivers are readily available on most operating systems]]\n[[Image:HDDCaddy.JPG|thumb|This 2.5 inch caddy uses a single connector mini USB]]\n\n===Native drive interfaces===\n{{main|Direct Attached Storage}}\n[[SCSI]], [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]], [[Fibre Channel]], [[eSATAp]], and [[eSATA]] interfaces can be used to directly connect the external hard drive to an internal [[host adapter]], without the need for any intervening controller.  External variants of these native drive [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]] are extremely similar to the internal protocols, but are often expanded to carry power (such as eSATAp and the SCSI [[Single Connector Attachment]]) and to use a more durable physical connector. A [[host adapter]] with external port may be necessary to connect a drive, if a computer lacks an available external port.\n\n===Direct attach serial interfaces===\n[[USB]] or [[FireWire]] connections are typically used to attach consumer class external hard drives to a computer. Unlike SCSI, eSATA, or SAS these require circuitry to convert the hard disk's native signal to the appropriate protocol. [[AT Attachment|Parallel ATA]] and internal Serial ATA hard disks are frequently connected to such chassis because nearly all computers on the market today have USB or FireWire ports, and these chassis are inexpensive and easy to find.\n\n===Network protocols===\n{{main|Network-attached storage}}\n[[iSCSI]], [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]], or [[CIFS]] are all commonly used protocols that are used to allow an external hard drive to use a network to send data to a computer system. This type of external hard drive is also known as [[Network-attached storage]] or NAS.  Often, such drives are [[embedded computer]]s running operating systems such as [[Linux]] or [[VxWorks]] that use their [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] daemons and [[SAMBA]] to provide a networked file system. A newer technology NAS, has been applied to some disk enclosures, which allows network ability, direct connection (e.g., USB) and even RAID features.\n\n== Hard drive shucking ==\n\"Shucking\" refers to the process of purchasing an external hard disk drive and removing the drive from its enclosure, in order for it to be used as an internal disk drive. This is performed because external drives are often cheaper than internal drives of the same capacity and model, and that external drives designed for continuous usage often contain hard drives designed for increased reliability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/324769/how-to-get-premium-hard-drives-for-cheap-by-shucking-external-drives/|title=How to Get Premium Hard Drives for Cheap by \u201cShucking\u201d External Drives|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Jason|website=How-To Geek|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the hard disk drive shortages caused by the [[2011 Thailand floods]], data storage company [[Backblaze]] reduced its cost of acquiring hard drives by purchasing external hard drives and shucking them.

In 1832, the hitherto semi-legendary state was officially proclaimed the first kingdom of [[Burmese monarchy]] by ''[[Glass Palace Chronicle|Hmannan Yazawin]]'', the [[Burmese chronicles|Royal Chronicle]] of the [[Konbaung Dynasty]]. ''Hmannan'' adds that the \"kingdom\" was founded by [[Abhiyaza]] of the [[Shakya|Sakya clan]] of the [[Buddha]] in 850 [[Common era|BCE]], and that through Abiyaza, Burmese monarchs traced their lineage to the Buddha and the first Buddhist (mythical) king of the world [[Maha Sammata]].<ref name=hy-1-153-154/> ''Hmannan'' also introduces another Sakya prince [[Dazayaza]] who founded the second Tagaung dynasty c. 600 BCE. The narrative superseded then prevailing pre-Buddhist [[Myth of origins|origin story]] in which the monarchy was founded by a descendant of a solar spirit and a dragon princess.\n\nArchaeological evidence indicates that [[Neolithic Age|Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] cultures existed at Tagaung, and a city-state founded by the [[Pyu people|Pyu]] emerged in the early centuries CE.

In 503 BCE, the queen of the last king of Tagaung, Thado Maha Yaza gave birth to twin blind sons, [[Maha Thanbawa]] and [[Sula Thanbawa]]. The king was ashamed, and ordered them killed. The queen hid her sons, and raised them in secret. Nineteen years later, in 484 BCE, the king found out that the brothers were still alive, and again ordered them killed.

The connection to the Pagan Dynasty was important because all later Burmese dynasties, [[Myinsaing Kingdom|Myinsaing]] to [[Konbaung Dynasty|Konbaung]] claimed lineage to the monarchs of Pagan.\n\n===Historicity===\nThe Abhiyaza story first appeared in Hmannan Yazawin (the Glass Palace Chronicle), compiled in 1832. The Burmese chronicles down to the early 18th century, including ''[[Maha Yazawin]]'' (the Great Chronicle) written in 1724, upon which ''Hmannan'' is heavily based, do not mention Abhiyaza. Instead, the pre-Hmannan origin story of the Burmese monarchy speaks of one Pyusawhti, son a solar spirit and a dragon princess, who later founded the [[Pagan Dynasty]].<ref name=tt-1964-ix-x>Than Tun 1964: ix\u2013x</ref> Moreover, the Abhiyaza/Dazayaza stories were layered upon the oral histories/legends of Tagaung and Sri Ksetra.\n\nHistorians trace the rise of Abhiyaza/Dazayaza stories to the 1770s, part of the early Konbaung kings' efforts to promote a more orthodox version of [[Theravada Buddhism]]. The trend gained ground under King [[Bodawpaya]] (r. 1782\u20131819) who, like his father [[Alaungpaya]], believed that he was the next Buddha, [[Maitreya]]. Though the king would later reluctantly gave up his claim and acceded to his late father's claim,<ref name=mha-188-189>Htin Aung 1967: 188\u2013189</ref> his purification drive devalued \"local sources of sanctity\" in favour of \"universal textual forms endorsed by the crown and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|monkhood]]\", and \"outlawed animal sacrifices atop [[Mt. Popa]] and other sacred sites while female and transvestite shamans lost status.\" In the reign of his successor [[Bagyidaw]] in 1832, the pre-Buddhist origin story of Pyusawhti was officially superseded with the Abhiyaza story's \"claims of royal descent from the clan of Gotama Buddha and thence the first Buddhist king of the world, Maha Sammata\".<ref name=vbl-196>Lieberman 2003: 196</ref>\n\nThe Chinese history book ''[[History of Yuan|Yuanshi]]'' also recorded the name \"Tagaung\"(\u592a\u516c). But it just a small town in north Burma. Chinese historian said the name \"Taruk\" is evolved from [[Turkic peoples|Turk]], thus the Chinese invasion happened in 13 century known as [[First Mongol invasion of Burma]].<ref>He 2004: 39 - 40</ref> G. E. Harvey said that it was probably [[Nanzhao]]'s invasion in 754 AD.<ref name=-geh-307-309/> Anyway, ''Hmannan Yazawin'' move it up to 6 BCE and became the history of Tagaung.\n\nThe late inclusion of Abhiyaza/Dazayaza stories did much damage to the credibility of the chronicles to the European historians of the [[British rule in Burma|British colonial era]]. They outright dismissed much of the chronicle tradition of early Burmese history as \"copies of Indian legends taken from Sanskrit or Pali originals\", highly doubted the antiquity of the chronicle tradition, and dismissed the possibility that any sort of civilisation in Burma could be much older than 500 CE.<ref name=tmu-2006-44-45/><ref name=dgeh-7>Hall 1960: 7</ref><ref name=-geh-307-309>Harvey 1925: 307\u2013309</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Pyu city-states}}\n[[File:Pyu Realm.png|thumb|left|150px|Pyu city-states circa 8th century]]\n\nThe Abhiyaza myth notwithstanding, evidence does indicate that many of the places mentioned in the royal records have indeed been inhabited continuously for at least 3500 years.<ref name=tmu-2006-44-45/> [[Neolithic Age|Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] artefacts discovered at Kyan Hnyat (30&nbsp;km south of Tagaung) confirm human habitation at Tagaung in the same era (1st millennium BCE) of both Tagaung dynasties reported in pre-''Hmannan'' chronicles.<ref name=ehm-2011-4-5>Moore 2011: 4\u20135</ref> To be sure, evidence of human habitation is not the same as that of a city-state.

(However, Tagaung has not been extensively excavated, and earlier evidence may yet emerge. Aside from Sri Ksetra and Beikthano, the rest of the Pyu sites have not been extensively excavated.)

One group moved down and settled at [[Bagan|Thunapayanta]] which was then inhabited by [[Pyu people|Pyus]], [[Kanyan people|Kanyans]] and [[Thet people|Thets]]. Another group went southeast, and founded what would later be known as the 19 districts of [[Kyaukse]]. They became known as the Binnaka line.<ref name=hy-1-155-156/> (Thunapayanta was located near present-day Pagan (Bagan), and the primary Pyu city-state in Kyaukse was [[Maingmaw]].<ref name=ehm-236>Moore 2007: 236</ref>) A third group led by Naga Hsein ({{my|\u1014\u102c\u1002\u1006\u102d\u1014\u103a}}), the queen of Binnaka Yaza, remained at Tagaung.\n\nThe queen then met [[Dazayaza]] (Dhajaraja), of royal Sakya lineage who had recently settled in Mauriya (somewhere in Upper Burma). She married him. Dazayaza and Naga Hsein built a new capital at Old Pagan, close to Tagaung. A dynasty of 16 kings followed.<ref name=hy-1-159-160>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 159\u2013160</ref> Some time after 483 BCE, invaders from the east sacked the kingdom during the reign of [[Thado Maha Yaza]], the 17th and last king.<ref name=app-276>Phayre 1883: 276</ref>\n\n===Tagaung legacy and linkage to later Burmese dynasties===\nBut the Sakya lineage had not died out, ''Hmannan'' continues. In 503 BCE, the queen of the last king of Tagaung, Thado Maha Yaza gave birth to twin blind sons, [[Maha Thanbawa]] and [[Sula Thanbawa]]. The king was ashamed, and ordered them killed. The queen hid her sons, and raised them in secret. Nineteen years later, in 484 BCE, the king found out that the brothers were still alive, and again ordered them killed. The queen managed to put the sons on a raft down the Irrawaddy.<ref name=hy-1-164-165>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 164\u2013165</ref> Adrift in the river, the brothers miraculously gained sight with the help of the ogress.\n\nIn 483 BCE, the brothers founded another kingdom much farther down the Irrawaddy at [[Sri Ksetra]], near modern [[Pyay]] (Prome). Maha Thanbawa was the first king and ruled for six years. He was followed by Sula Thanbawa, ruling for 35 years. He was followed by King Duttabaung, son of Maha Thanbawa. Duttabaung ruled for 70 years.<ref name=app-277-278>Phayre 1883: 277\u2013278</ref> In all, Sri Ksetra lasted nearly six centuries.<ref name=tmu-2006-44-45/>\n\nAround 107 CE, [[Thamoddarit]] ({{my|\u101e\u1019\u102f\u1012\u1039\u1012\u101b\u102c\u1007\u103a}}), nephew of the last king of Sri Ksetra, founded the city of [[Bagan|Pagan]] (Bagan) (formally, Arimaddana-pura ({{my|\u1021\u101b\u102d\u1019\u1012\u1039\u1012\u1014\u102c\u1015\u1030\u101b}}), lit. \"the City that Tramples on Enemies\").<ref name=vbl-91>Lieberman 2003: 91</ref> The site reportedly was visited by the Buddha himself during his lifetime, and it was where he allegedly pronounced that a great kingdom would arise at this very location 651 years after his death.<ref name=hy-1-188>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 188</ref> Thamoddarit was followed by a caretaker, and then Pyusawhti in 167 CE. The connection to the Pagan Dynasty was important because all later Burmese dynasties, [[Myinsaing Kingdom|Myinsaing]] to [[Konbaung Dynasty|Konbaung]] claimed lineage to the monarchs of Pagan.\n\n===Historicity===\nThe Abhiyaza story first appeared in Hmannan Yazawin (the Glass Palace Chronicle), compiled in 1832. The Burmese chronicles down to the early 18th century, including ''[[Maha Yazawin]]'' (the Great Chronicle) written in 1724, upon which ''Hmannan'' is heavily based, do not mention Abhiyaza. Instead, the pre-Hmannan origin story of the Burmese monarchy speaks of one Pyusawhti, son a solar spirit and a dragon princess, who later founded the [[Pagan Dynasty]].<ref name=tt-1964-ix-x>Than Tun 1964: ix\u2013x</ref> Moreover, the Abhiyaza/Dazayaza stories were layered upon the oral histories/legends of Tagaung and Sri Ksetra.\n\nHistorians trace the rise of Abhiyaza/Dazayaza stories to the 1770s, part of the early Konbaung kings' efforts to promote a more orthodox version of [[Theravada Buddhism]]. The trend gained ground under King [[Bodawpaya]] (r. 1782\u20131819) who, like his father [[Alaungpaya]], believed that he was the next Buddha, [[Maitreya]]. Though the king would later reluctantly gave up his claim and acceded to his late father's claim,<ref name=mha-188-189>Htin Aung 1967: 188\u2013189</ref> his purification drive devalued \"local sources of sanctity\" in favour of \"universal textual forms endorsed by the crown and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|monkhood]]\", and \"outlawed animal sacrifices atop [[Mt. Popa]] and other sacred sites while female and transvestite shamans lost status.\" In the reign of his successor [[Bagyidaw]] in 1832, the pre-Buddhist origin story of Pyusawhti was officially superseded with the Abhiyaza story's \"claims of royal descent from the clan of Gotama Buddha and thence the first Buddhist king of the world, Maha Sammata\".<ref name=vbl-196>Lieberman 2003: 196</ref>\n\nThe Chinese history book ''[[History of Yuan|Yuanshi]]'' also recorded the name \"Tagaung\"(\u592a\u516c). But it just a small town in north Burma. Chinese invasion happened in 13 century that known as [[First Mongol invasion of Burma]]. ''Hmannan Yazawin'' move it up to 6 BCE and became the history of Tagaung.<ref>He 2004: 39 - 40</ref>\n\nThe late inclusion of Abhiyaza/Dazayaza stories did much damage to the credibility of the chronicles to the European historians of the [[British rule in Burma|British colonial era]]. They outright dismissed much of the chronicle tradition of early Burmese history as \"copies of Indian legends taken from Sanskrit or Pali originals\", highly doubted the antiquity of the chronicle tradition, and dismissed the possibility that any sort of civilisation in Burma could be much older than 500 CE.<ref name=tmu-2006-44-45/><ref name=dgeh-7>Hall 1960: 7</ref><ref name=-geh-307-309>Harvey 1925: 307\u2013309</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Pyu city-states}}\n[[File:Pyu Realm.png|thumb|left|150px|Pyu city-states circa 8th century]]\n\nThe Abhiyaza myth notwithstanding, evidence does indicate that many of the places mentioned in the royal records have indeed been inhabited continuously for at least 3500 years.<ref name=tmu-2006-44-45/> [[Neolithic Age|Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] artefacts discovered at Kyan Hnyat (30&nbsp;km south of Tagaung) confirm human habitation at Tagaung in the same era (1st millennium BCE) of both Tagaung dynasties reported in pre-''Hmannan'' chronicles.<ref name=ehm-2011-4-5>Moore 2011: 4\u20135</ref> To be sure, evidence of human habitation is not the same as that of a city-state. Extant evidence indicates that Tagaung emerged as a city-state (a triple-walled emerged as a city-state site on the east bank of the Irrawaddy) only in the \"early centuries CE\". (However, Tagaung has not been extensively excavated, and earlier evidence may yet emerge. Aside from Sri Ksetra and Beikthano, the rest of the Pyu sites have not been extensively excavated.) Moreover, the states of Tagaung, Sri Ksetra and Pagan all existed in the order, though not in the discrete fashion reported in the chronicles.

This design approach is used by companies whose product strategy is family-based or platform-driven, where a prescriptive design strategy is fundamental to the success of the design process by embedding engineering constraints and relationships to quickly optimize the design, or where the resulting geometry may be complex or based upon equations.  Creo Elements provides a complete set of design, analysis and manufacturing capabilities on one, integral, scalable platform.  These required capabilities include Solid Modeling, Surfacing, Rendering, Data Interoperability, Routed Systems Design, Simulation, Tolerance Analysis, and [[numerical control|NC]] and Tooling Design.\n\nCreo Elements can be used to create a complete 3D digital model of manufactured goods. The models consist of 2D and 3D solid model data which can also be used downstream in [[finite element analysis]], [[rapid prototyping]], tooling design, and CNC manufacturing.  All data are associative and interchangeable between the CAD, CAE and CAM modules without [[Data conversion|conversion]].  A product and its entire [[bill of materials]] (BOM) can be modeled accurately with fully associative [[engineering drawing]]s, and revision control information.  The associativity functionality in Creo Elements enables users to make changes in the design at any time during the product development process and automatically update downstream deliverables.  This capability enables [[concurrent engineering]] \u2013 design, analysis and manufacturing engineers working in parallel \u2013 and streamlines product development processes.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Creo Elements Pro screen cap 01.png|thumb|left]] -->\n==Summary of capabilities==\n\nCreo Elements is a software application within the CAID/CAD/CAM/CAE category.\n\nCreo Elements is a parametric, feature-based modeling architecture incorporated into a single database philosophy with rule-based design capabilities. It provides in-depth control of complex geometry, as exemplified by the [[trajpar]] parameter. The capabilities of the product can be split into the three main headings of Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing. This data is then documented in a standard 2D [[production drawing]] or the 3D drawing standard [[ASME Y14.41-2003]].\n\n=== Product Design ===\n\nCreo Elements offers a range of tools to enable the generation of a complete digital representation of the product being designed. In addition to the general geometry tools there is also the ability to generate geometry of other integrated design disciplines such as industrial and standard [[Piping|pipe work]] and complete wiring definitions. Tools are also available to support collaborative development.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bottombracket-Creo-Freeform-image.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot captured from Creo 1.0 as an example of the FreeForm surfaces. Sub'D surfaces new in Creo 1.0 This geometry started as a square cube]] -->\n\nA number of concept design tools that provide up-front Industrial Design concepts can then be used in the downstream process of engineering the product. These range from conceptual Industrial design sketches, reverse engineering with point cloud data and comprehensive free-form surface.\n=== Analysis ===\n\nCreo Elements has numerous analysis tools available and covers thermal, static, dynamic and fatigue finite element analysis along with other tools all designed to help with the development of the product. These tools include human factors, manufacturing tolerance, mould flow and design optimization. The design optimization can be used at a geometry level to obtain the optimum design dimensions and in conjunction with the finite element analysis.\n\n=== Surface Modeling ===\nCreo has a good surface modeling capabilities also. Using commands like Boundary blend and Sweep we can create surface models. Advance options like Style (Interactive Surface Design Extension - ISDX) and Freestyle <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ptc.com/cad/3d-design/parametric-and-freestyle-surfacing|title=Parametric and Freestyle Surfacing - PTC|publisher=}}</ref> provide more capabilities to designer to create complicated models with ease.\n\n'''Manufacturing'''\n\nBy using the fundamental abilities of the software with regards to the single data source principle, it provides a rich set of tools in the manufacturing environment in the form of tooling design and simulated CNC machining and output.\n\nTooling options cover specialty tools for molding, die-casting and progressive tooling design.\n\n==Release History==\nThe [[UNIX]] version was discontinued after 4.0,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.single-sourcing.com/release/20100212-arbortext-support-solaris-linux/|title=News from PTC: PTC announces end of Arbortext Linux and Solaris support|publisher=single-sourcing.com|url-status=live|access-date=2011-12-06}}</ref> except [[x86-64]] UNIX on [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]].<ref>{{citation|title=Software Update Availability (Advanced)|date=2012-06-06|url=http://www.ptc.com/cgi/support/apps/sft_upd_dsp/sft_upd_dsp_adv.pl?product=ENG|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810203624/http://www.ptc.com/cgi/support/apps/sft_upd_dsp/sft_upd_dsp_adv.pl?product=ENG|publisher=PTC|accessdate=2012-06-06|archivedate=2012-08-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> The name changed to Creo 1.0 after Pro/Engineer Wildfire 5.0 (rebranded PTC Creo Elements/Pro),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ptc.com/appserver/wcms/standards/textsub.jsp?&im_dbkey=118992&icg_dbkey=21|title=PTC - PTC Introduces Creo Design Software|publisher=}}</ref> took place on October 28, 2010, which coincided with PTC\u2019s announcement of [[Creo (design software)|Creo]], a new design software application suite.\n\nFor the first 10 years, PTC generally released 2 versions per year, with some exceptions.

This design approach is used by companies whose product strategy is family-based or platform-driven, where a prescriptive design strategy is fundamental to the success of the design process by embedding engineering constraints and relationships to quickly optimize the design, or where the resulting geometry may be complex or based upon equations.  Creo Elements provides a complete set of design, analysis and manufacturing capabilities on one, integral, scalable platform.  These required capabilities include Solid Modeling, Surfacing, Rendering, Data Interoperability, Routed Systems Design, Simulation, Tolerance Analysis, and [[numerical control|NC]] and Tooling Design.\n\nCreo Elements can be used to create a complete 3D digital model of manufactured goods. The models consist of 2D and 3D solid model data which can also be used downstream in [[finite element analysis]], [[rapid prototyping]], tooling design, and CNC manufacturing.  All data are associative and interchangeable between the CAD, CAE and CAM modules without [[Data conversion|conversion]].  A product and its entire [[bill of materials]] (BOM) can be modeled accurately with fully associative [[engineering drawing]]s, and revision control information.  The associativity functionality in Creo Elements enables users to make changes in the design at any time during the product development process and automatically update downstream deliverables.  This capability enables [[concurrent engineering]] \u2013 design, analysis and manufacturing engineers working in parallel \u2013 and streamlines product development processes.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Creo Elements Pro screen cap 01.png|thumb|left]] -->\n==Summary of capabilities==\n\nCreo Elements is a software application within the CAID/CAD/CAM/CAE category.\n\nCreo Elements is a parametric, feature-based modeling architecture incorporated into a single database philosophy with rule-based design capabilities. It provides in-depth control of complex geometry, as exemplified by the [[trajpar]] parameter. The capabilities of the product can be split into the three main headings of Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing. This data is then documented in a standard 2D [[production drawing]] or the 3D drawing standard [[ASME Y14.41-2003]].\n\n=== Product Design ===\n\nCreo Elements offers a range of tools to enable the generation of a complete digital representation of the product being designed. In addition to the general geometry tools there is also the ability to generate geometry of other integrated design disciplines such as industrial and standard [[Piping|pipe work]] and complete wiring definitions. Tools are also available to support collaborative development.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bottombracket-Creo-Freeform-image.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot captured from Creo 1.0 as an example of the FreeForm surfaces. Sub'D surfaces new in Creo 1.0 This geometry started as a square cube]] -->\n\nA number of concept design tools that provide up-front Industrial Design concepts can then be used in the downstream process of engineering the product. These range from conceptual Industrial design sketches, reverse engineering with point cloud data and comprehensive free-form surface.\n=== Analysis ===\n\nCreo Elements has numerous analysis tools available and covers thermal, static, dynamic and fatigue finite element analysis along with other tools all designed to help with the development of the product. These tools include human factors, manufacturing tolerance, mould flow and design optimization. The design optimization can be used at a geometry level to obtain the optimum design dimensions and in conjunction with the finite element analysis.\n\n=== Surface Modeling ===\nCreo has a good surface modeling capabilities also. Using commands like Boundary blend and Sweep we can create surface models. Advance options like Style (Interactive Surface Design Extension - ISDX) and Freestyle <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ptc.com/cad/3d-design/parametric-and-freestyle-surfacing|title=Parametric and Freestyle Surfacing - PTC|publisher=}}</ref> provide more capabilities to designer to create complicated models with ease.\n\n'''Manufacturing'''\n\nBy using the fundamental abilities of the software with regards to the single data source principle, it provides a rich set of tools in the manufacturing environment in the form of tooling design and simulated CNC machining and output.\n\nTooling options cover specialty tools for molding, die-casting and progressive tooling design.\n\n==Release History==\nThe [[UNIX]] version was discontinued after 4.0,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.single-sourcing.com/release/20100212-arbortext-support-solaris-linux/|title=News from PTC: PTC announces end of Arbortext Linux and Solaris support|publisher=single-sourcing.com|url-status=live|access-date=2011-12-06}}</ref> except [[x86-64]] UNIX on [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]].<ref>{{citation|title=Software Update Availability (Advanced)|date=2012-06-06|url=http://www.ptc.com/cgi/support/apps/sft_upd_dsp/sft_upd_dsp_adv.pl?product=ENG|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810203624/http://www.ptc.com/cgi/support/apps/sft_upd_dsp/sft_upd_dsp_adv.pl?product=ENG|publisher=PTC|accessdate=2012-06-06|archivedate=2012-08-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> The name changed to Creo 1.0 after Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 5.0 (rebranded PTC Creo Elements/Pro),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ptc.com/appserver/wcms/standards/textsub.jsp?&im_dbkey=118992&icg_dbkey=21|title=PTC - PTC Introduces Creo Design Software|publisher=}}</ref> took place on October 28, 2010, which coincided with PTC\u2019s announcement of [[Creo (design software)|Creo]], a new design software application suite.\n\nFor the first 10 years, PTC generally released 2 versions per year, with some exceptions.
