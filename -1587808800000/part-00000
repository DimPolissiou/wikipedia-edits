Execution by [[shooting]] is a fairly old practice. Some reasons for its use are that [[firearm]]s are usually readily available and a [[gunshot]] to a [[vital organ]], such as brain or heart, most often, will kill relatively quickly.\n\nA firing squad is normally composed of several military personnel. Usually, all members of the group are instructed to fire simultaneously, thus preventing both disruption of the process by a single member and identification of the member who fired the lethal shot. To avoid disfigurement due to multiple shots to the head, the shooters are typically instructed to aim at the [[heart]], sometimes aided by a paper target. The prisoner is typically blindfolded or hooded, as well as restrained, although in some cases prisoners have asked to be allowed to face the firing squad without their eyes covered. Media portrayals have frequently shown condemned being offered a final cigarette as well. [[Execution (legal)|Executions]] can be carried out with the condemned either standing or sitting. There is a tradition in some jurisdictions that such executions are carried out at [[dawn|first light]] or at sunrise. This gave rise to the phrase \"shot at dawn\".\n\nExecution by firing squad is distinct from other forms of execution by firearms, such as an [[execution by shooting]] to the back of the head or neck. However, the single shot by the squad's officer with a pistol ([[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]) is sometimes incorporated in a firing squad execution, particularly if the initial volley turns out not to be immediately fatal. Before the introduction of firearms, [[Bow (weapon)|bow]]s or [[crossbow]]s were often used\u2014[[Saint Sebastian]] is usually depicted as executed by a squad of [[auxilia|Roman auxiliary]] archers in around 288 AD; King [[Edmund the Martyr]] of [[East Anglia]], by some accounts, was tied to a tree and executed by [[Viking]] archers on 20 November 869 or 870 AD.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Military significance==\n[[File:Poprava v\u016fdc\u016f rumbursk\u00e9 vzpoury 1918.jpg|thumb|Execution by [[Austria-Hungary]] of the Czech leaders of a [[mutiny]] against their superior officers, 1918.]]\n\nThe method is often the supreme punishment or disciplinary means employed by [[military court]]s for crimes such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[espionage]], [[murder]], [[mutiny]], or [[treason]].\n\nIf the condemned prisoner is an ex-officer who is acknowledged to have shown bravery in their past career, they may be accorded the privilege of giving the order to fire. An example of this is [[Marshal of France]] [[Michel Ney]]. As a means of insulting the condemned, however, past executions have had them shot in the back, denied blindfolds, or even tied to chairs. This was the method used to execute [[Galeazzo Ciano]], son-in-law of Benito Mussolini, and several other former Fascists who voted to remove him from power. By some reports, Ciano managed to twist his chair around at the last second to face his executioners.\n\n==Blank cartridge==\nIn some cases, one or more members of the firing squad may be issued a weapon containing a [[Blank (cartridge)|blank cartridge]].<ref>{{Cite book | isbn= 978-1594160035 | page= 208 | last= Huie | first= William Bradford | title= The Execution of Private Slovik | year= 1954 | publisher= Duell, Sloan & Pearce| title-link= The Execution of Private Slovik }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/firing-squad |title=Crime Library: Firing Squad |publisher=Crime Museum |date=2016-05-25 |accessdate=2016-05-30}}</ref> No member of the firing squad is told beforehand if they are using live ammunition. This is believed to reinforce the sense of [[diffusion of responsibility]] among the firing squad members. This diffusion of responsibility makes the execution process more reliable because the members are more likely to aim to kill if they are not entirely blamed for it, or if there is a chance they did not fire the lethal shot. It also allows each member of the firing squad to believe afterwards that he did not personally fire a fatal shot<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/procedure_dec-1947.pdf | date= December 1947 | title= Procedure for Military Executions | publisher = Department of the Army | access-date=2017-01-23}}</ref>\u2014for this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the \"conscience round\".\n[[File:Austrians executing Serbs 1917.JPG|thumb|right|Serbian [[prisoners of war]] arranged in a semi-circle, executed by an [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] firing squad in World War&nbsp;I.]]\n\nAccording to Pte.

The death penalty is never the only possible sentence for a crime, and the punishment must be imposed by the military courts system. Per the norms of the Brazilian Code of Military Penal Procedure, the death penalty is carried out by firing squad.\n\nAlthough Brazil still permits the use of capital punishment during wartime, no convicts were actually executed during Brazil's last military conflict, the Second World War.

The last death penalty in Denmark was executed on 20 July 1950 at Ib Birkedal Hansen, who was convicted of treason as a result of his work as a Gestapo interrogator and torture executioner during the occupation.

Usually the executions were carried out by the regimental military police platoon, or in the case of spies by the local military police. One Finn, [[Toivo Koljonen]], was executed for a civilian crime (six murders). Most executions occurred in 1941 and during the Soviet Summer Offensive in 1944.

Execution by [[shooting]] is a fairly old practice. Some reasons for its use are that [[firearm]]s are usually readily available and a [[gunshot]] to a [[vital organ]], such as brain or heart, most often, will kill relatively quickly.\n\nA firing squad is normally composed of several military personnel. Usually, all members of the group are instructed to fire simultaneously, thus preventing both disruption of the process by a single member and identification of the member who fired the lethal shot. To avoid disfigurement due to multiple shots to the head, the shooters are typically instructed to aim at the [[heart]], sometimes aided by a paper target. The prisoner is typically blindfolded or hooded, as well as restrained, although in some cases prisoners have asked to be allowed to face the firing squad without their eyes covered. Media portrayals have frequently shown condemned being offered a final cigarette as well. [[Execution (legal)|Executions]] can be carried out with the condemned either standing or sitting. There is a tradition in some jurisdictions that such executions are carried out at [[dawn|first light]] or at sunrise. This gave rise to the phrase \"shot at dawn\".\n\nExecution by firing squad is distinct from other forms of execution by firearms, such as an [[execution by shooting]] to the back of the head or neck. However, the single shot by the squad's officer with a pistol ([[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]) is sometimes incorporated in a firing squad execution, particularly if the initial volley turns out not to be immediately fatal. Before the introduction of firearms, [[Bow (weapon)|bow]]s or [[crossbow]]s were often used\u2014[[Saint Sebastian]] is usually depicted as executed by a squad of [[auxilia|Roman auxiliary]] archers in around 288 AD; King [[Edmund the Martyr]] of [[East Anglia]], by some accounts, was tied to a tree and executed by [[Viking]] archers on 20 November 869 or 870 AD.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Military significance==\n[[File:Poprava v\u016fdc\u016f rumbursk\u00e9 vzpoury 1918.jpg|thumb|Execution by [[Austria-Hungary]] of the Czech leaders of a [[mutiny]] against their superior officers, 1918.]]\n\nThe method is often the supreme punishment or disciplinary means employed by [[military court]]s for crimes such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[espionage]], [[murder]], [[mutiny]], or [[treason]].\n\nIf the condemned prisoner is an ex-officer who is acknowledged to have shown bravery in their past career, they may be accorded the privilege of giving the order to fire. An example of this is [[Marshal of France]] [[Michel Ney]]. As a means of insulting the condemned, however, past executions have had them shot in the back, denied blindfolds, or even tied to chairs. This was the method used to execute [[Galeazzo Ciano]], son-in-law of Benito Mussolini, and several other former Fascists who voted to remove him from power. By some reports, Ciano managed to twist his chair around at the last second to face his executioners.\n\n==Blank cartridge==\nIn some cases, one or more members of the firing squad may be issued a weapon containing a [[Blank (cartridge)|blank cartridge]].<ref>{{Cite book | isbn= 978-1594160035 | page= 208 | last= Huie | first= William Bradford | title= The Execution of Private Slovik | year= 1954 | publisher= Duell, Sloan & Pearce| title-link= The Execution of Private Slovik }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/firing-squad |title=Crime Library: Firing Squad |publisher=Crime Museum |date=2016-05-25 |accessdate=2016-05-30}}</ref> No member of the firing squad is told beforehand if they are using live ammunition. This is believed to reinforce the sense of [[diffusion of responsibility]] among the firing squad members. This diffusion of responsibility makes the execution process more reliable because the members are more likely to aim to kill if they are not entirely blamed for it, or if there is a chance they did not fire the lethal shot. It also allows each member of the firing squad to believe afterwards that he did not personally fire a fatal shot<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/procedure_dec-1947.pdf | date= December 1947 | title= Procedure for Military Executions | publisher = Department of the Army | access-date=2017-01-23}}</ref>\u2014for this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the \"conscience round\".\n[[File:Austrians executing Serbs 1917.JPG|thumb|right|Serbian [[prisoners of war]] arranged in a semi-circle, executed by an [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] firing squad in World War&nbsp;I.]]\n\nAccording to Pte. W. A. Quinton, who served in the [[British Army]] during the [[First World War]] and had the experience of serving with a firing squad in October 1915, he and 11 colleagues were relieved of any live ammunition and their own rifles before being issued replacement weapons.
