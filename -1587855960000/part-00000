The letter was composed at some time between AD 70 and AD 140, most likely around 96. It ranks with [[Didache]] as one of the earliest\u2014if not the earliest\u2014of extant Christian documents outside the canonical [[New Testament]]. As the name suggests, a [[Second Epistle of Clement]] is known, but this is a later work by a different author. Neither 1 nor 2 Clement are part of the [[Biblical canon|canonical New Testament]], but they are part of the [[Apostolic Fathers]] collection.\n\nThe letter is a response to events in Corinth, where the congregation had deposed certain elders (presbyters). The author called on the congregation to repent, to restore the elders to their position, and to obey their superiors. He said that the [[Apostles]] had appointed the church leadership and directed them on how to perpetuate the ministry.\n\nThe work is attributed to Clement I, the [[Bishop of Rome]]. In Corinth, the letter was read aloud from time to time. This practice spread to other churches, and Christians translated the Greek work into Latin, Syriac, and other languages. Some early Christians even treated the work like scripture. The work was lost for centuries, but since the 1600s various copies or fragments have been found and studied. It has provided valuable evidence about the structure of the [[early church]].\n\n==Authorship and date==\nAlthough traditionally attributed to [[Pope Clement I|Clement of Rome]],<ref>{{citation|editor-last=Jurgens|editor-first=W A|title=The Faith of the Early Fathers: A Source-book of Theological and Historical Passages from the Christian Writings of the Pre-Nicene and Nicene Eras|url=https://books.google.com/?id=l62q-d4Wi20C|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1970|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-0432-8|page=6}}</ref> the letter does not include Clement's name, and is anonymous, though scholars generally consider it to be genuine.<ref name=ODCC_Clement>\"Clement of Rome, St.\" Cross, F.

Since none of the presbyters were charged with moral offences, 1 Clement charges that their removal was high-handed and unjustifiable. The letter is extremely lengthy\u2014twice as long as the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]]\u2014and includes many references to the Old Testament.<ref name=\"Metzger\">[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''Canon of the New Testament'' ([[Oxford University Press]]) 1987:42\u201343.</ref>\n\n1 Clement offers valuable evidence about the state of the ministry in the early church. He calls on the Corinthians to repent and to reinstate the leaders that they had deposed. He explains that the Apostles had appointed \u201dbishops and deacons\u201d, that they had given instructions on how to perpetuate the ministry, and that Christians were to obey their superiors. The author uses the terms \u201dbishops\u201d (overseers, episkopos) and \u201delders\u201d (presbyters) interchangeably.<ref name=ODCC_Clement/>\n\nNew Testament references include admonition to \u201cTake up the epistle of the blessed Paul the Apostle\u201d (xlvii. 1) which was written to this Corinthian audience; a reference which seems to imply written documents available at both Rome and Corinth. 1 Clement also alludes to the first epistle of [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|Paul to the Corinthians]]; and may allude to Paul's epistles to the Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, and Philippians, numerous phrases from the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], and possible material from Acts, James, and I Peter. In several instances, the author asks his readers to \u201cremember\u201d the words of [[Jesus]], although they do not attribute these sayings to a specific written account. These New Testament allusions are employed as authoritative sources which strengthen the letter's arguments to the Corinthian church. According to [[Bruce Metzger]], Clement never explicitly refers to these New Testament references as \u201cScripture\u201d.<ref name=\"Metzger\"/>\n\nAdditionally, 1 Clement expressly references the martyrdom of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] and very strongly implies the martyrdom of [[Peter the Apostle|Peter]] (sections 5:4 to 6:1).<ref>{{cite book|last1=McDowell|first1=Sean|title=The Fate of the Apostles|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|pages=55\u2013114}}</ref>\n\n1 Clement was written at a time when some Christians were keenly aware that Jesus had not returned as they had expected. Like 2 Peter, this epistle criticizes those who had doubts about the faith because the Second Coming hadn't yet occurred.<ref>[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible.

The letter was composed at some time between AD 70 and AD 140, most likely around 96. It ranks with [[Didache]] as one of the earliest\u2014if not the earliest\u2014of extant Christian documents outside the canonical [[New Testament]]. As the name suggests, a [[Second Epistle of Clement]] is known, but this is a later work by a different author. Neither 1 nor 2 Clement are part of the [[Biblical canon|canonical New Testament]], but they are part of the [[Apostolic Fathers]] collection.\n\nThe letter is a response to events in Corinth, where the congregation had deposed certain elders (presbyters). The author called on the congregation to repent, to restore the elders to their position, and to obey their superiors. He said that the [[Apostles]] had appointed the church leadership and directed them on how to perpetuate the ministry. \n\nThe work is attributed to Clement I, the [[Bishop of Rome]]. In Corinth, the letter was read aloud from time to time. This practice spread to other churches, and Christians translated the Greek work into Latin, Syriac, and other languages. Some early Christians even treated the work like scripture. The work was lost for centuries, but since the 1600s various copies or fragments have been found and studied. It has provided valuable evidence about the structure of the [[early church]].\n\n==Authorship and date==\nAlthough traditionally attributed to [[Pope Clement I|Clement of Rome]],<ref>{{citation|editor-last=Jurgens|editor-first=W A|title=The Faith of the Early Fathers: A Source-book of Theological and Historical Passages from the Christian Writings of the Pre-Nicene and Nicene Eras|url=https://books.google.com/?id=l62q-d4Wi20C|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1970|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-0432-8|page=6}}</ref> the letter does not include Clement's name, and is anonymous, though scholars generally consider it to be genuine.<ref name=ODCC_Clement>\"Clement of Rome, St.\" Cross, F.

Since none of the presbyters were charged with moral offences, 1 Clement charges that their removal was high-handed and unjustifiable. The letter is extremely lengthy\u2014twice as long as the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]]\u2014and includes many references to the Old Testament.<ref name=\"Metzger\">[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''Canon of the New Testament'' ([[Oxford University Press]]) 1987:42\u201343.</ref>\n\n1 Clement offers valuable evidence about the state of the ministry in the early church. He calls on the Corinthians to repent and to reinstate the leaders that they had deposed. He explains that the Apostles had appointed \u201dbishops and deacons\u201d, that they had given instructions on how to perpetuate the ministry, and that Christians were to obey their superiors. The author uses the terms \u201dbishops\u201d (overseers, episkopos) and \u201delders\u201d (presbyters) interchangeably.<ref name=ODCC_Clement/>\n\nNew Testament references include admonition to \u201cTake up the epistle of the blessed Paul the Apostle\u201d (xlvii. 1) which was written to this Corinthian audience; a reference which seems to imply written documents available at both Rome and Corinth. 1 Clement also alludes to the first epistle of [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|Paul to the Corinthians]]; and may allude to Paul's epistles to the Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, and Philippians, numerous phrases from the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], and possible material from Acts, James, and I Peter. In several instances, the author asks his readers to \u201cremember\u201d the words of [[Jesus]], although they do not attribute these sayings to a specific written account. These New Testament allusions are employed as authoritative sources which strengthen the letter's arguments to the Corinthian church. According to [[Bruce Metzger]], Clement never explicitly refers to these New Testament references as \u201cScripture\u201d.<ref name=\"Metzger\"/>\n\nAdditionally, 1 Clement expressly references the martyrdom of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] and very strongly implies the martyrdom of [[Peter the Apostle|Peter]] (sections 5:4 to 6:1).<ref>{{cite book|last1=McDowell|first1=Sean|title=The Fate of the Apostles|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|pages=55\u2013114}}</ref>\n\n1 Clement was written at a time when some Christians were keenly aware that Jesus had not returned as they had expected. Like 2 Peter, this epistle criticizes those who had doubts about the faith because the Second Coming hadn't yet occurred.<ref>[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible.

While he viewed himself as a [[man of letters]], he prized his stories and poems above his other work.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=149}} To Goodman, writing was \"his vice\" or \"way of being in the world\".{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=150}}\n\n{{toc limit|2}}\n\n== Background ==\n<!--to be reorganized into a general overview with sections on novels and stories -->\n\nGoodman began to write stories in high school. He often composed in pencil on scraps that he carried. Goodman wrote his stories on cheap newsprint and his longhand filled every available space, to its edges. He typed his second draft and might pencil corrections before sending it for editing. Goodman's passion was for writing, not finishing. He continually returned to his works and was known to make revisions in printed editions even when the work had no plans for re-release. He would receive criticism for revising some works dozens of years after their publication, \"spoiling their favorites\".{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=149}} For the first half of his life, Goodman thought he did his best work in the middle of the night. He attempted a rhythm of writing at least a page daily such that he would have frequent temptation to lose himself in the work. This daily calisthenic of finishing a thought at his own pace contributed to Goodman's prolific output. Goodman's story manuscripts read as rhapsodic episodes, showing few pauses and fitting together like a prose poem.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=150}}\n\nIn his early years, Goodman also wrote scenes in the style of [[Guy de Maupassant]], was accused of imitating [[James Joyce]], and explored the styles of [[Ring Lardner]], [[Jean Cocteau]], and [[Pierre Mac Orlan]]. But Goodman's [[literary executor]], [[Taylor Stoehr]], likened Goodman's style to [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] most of all.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=151}}\n\nMuch of Goodman's fiction was based on his life{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=151}}<!--note where his material came from?--> and as a result, included self-examination among its themes.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=152}} ''Johnson'' and ''The Break-Up of Our Camp'', written after his college graduation, were based on a romantic interest and Jewish boys' camp where Goodman was a counselor. Some chapters of these novels-in-stories were published in magazines.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=151}}<!-- more on both in source -->\n\nIn the late 1930s, after moving to Chicago, Goodman reconsidered his approach to fiction and wrote a dozen works of prose in a style he termed \"cubist\", in which he abstracted its formal/literary elements as alienated from mere character relations.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|pp=153\u2013154}} Of these stories, \"A Ceremonial\", received the most critical attention, but [[Klaus Mann]] saw serenity where Goodman had intended an alienated tone.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=155}} Goodman received fair recognition within New York literary circles into 1940 as he published in multiple magazines,{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=155}} but many opportunities soon fell through, particularly as Goodman made enemies with his aggressive [[World War II]] pacifism. <!--Goodman's pacifism led him to lambaste his own literary supporters [[James Laughlin]] and [[John Crowe Ransom]] for endorsing the war-->Goodman's Japanese Noh plays, ''Stop-Light'', released a week after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. ''The Grand Piano'', his antiwar novel, fell flat against the [[Philippines campaign (1941\u20131942)|Philippines campaign]]. After publishing little in 1943 and being fired for seducing his students, Goodman was becoming notorious.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=156}}\n\nSmall presses continued to publish his works, but Goodman was bothered by his self-image as an embattled writer alienated from society, both well-published and unknown at once.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|pp=156\u2013157}} While continuing to write over 100 stories, plays, essays, and constant poems throughout the 1940s, Goodman channeled his troubles into his writing and focused on the social issues associated with his alienation\u2014politics, psychosexuality, religion\u2014and wrote on topics including education, anarchism (\"[[The May Pamphlet]]\"), and civic design (''[[Communitas (book)|Communitas]]'').{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=156}} Meanwhile, in his fiction, Goodman's [[epic novel]] project ''[[The Empire City]]'' was an inward-looking satire subtitled \"An Almanac of Alienation\". He wrote it as a series of heroic portraits whose characters were abstractions of \"sociological and psychological causes\". In his short stories, Goodman removed conventional plot, character, and setting as familial essays with his self-styled \"cubist\" literary emphasis on formal manner.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=157}} He called these styles \"expressionistic naturalism\" and \"dialectical lyrics\", respectively, though the literary experiments outgrew the label. He stopped categorizing his career stages upon growing comfortable with his stature in the field.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|pp=157\u2013158}}\n\nIn the mid-1940s, Goodman's stories became more polemical in indignant self-defense of his provocative lifestyle,<!--thin characters; \"moral and psychological fogs\" impenetrable \"without the biographical key\"--> though as he entered therapy, the stories became self-critical and reflective of psychoanalytic ideas. In one work, he remarked that \"disparaging the ego\" and hatred of self were the core theme of his stories. In \"Incidents of the Labyrinth\", an allegory of soul-searching in the myth of the [[Labyrinth]], Goodman recounted how those who search for the [[meaning of life]] (or others who ask those questions) are likely to be unhappy.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=158}} His late-1940s stories were part of his self-analysis (e.g., free analysis and childhood memories) with fewer formal devices, more openings to the unconscious, and clear analogies of inward searching.<!--also ego vs. imagination-->{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\nGoodman came to see his fiction as \"myths\" in the 1950s, either by finding something mythical in a traditional American scene or in finding something familiar in an ancient, foreign myth.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|pp=160\u2013161}} In these works, Goodman wrote about rescuers and doctors who save their victims but not themselves.<!-- list below but also see this page for The Death of Aesculapius and An Asclepiad; Jeremy Owen; St. Wayward fifth book of Empire City-->{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=161}} In this period, Goodman moved past motifs of \"divided self\" and towards making whole: \"Relent, remedy\".{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|pp=159\u2013160}} Goodman believed in [[paradise lost]], that the power of healers (to remedy) comes from sacrificing their own health and happiness (to relent).<!-- list of themes in relation to the 50s-->{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=161}} For example, the sailors of \"The Galley to Mytilene\" <!--cut \"down the suicidal inhabitants\"?-->revive the survivors, signifying how after relenting towards himself, Goodman is free to relent towards others (the survivors).{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=160}} The plot of \"relent, remedy\" recurs throughout much of the Goodman's remaining fiction (\"The Death of Aesculapius\", \"Bathers at Westover Pond\"<!--, \"A Lifeguard\", \"A Rescue\"-->) up through his breakthrough work of social criticism, ''[[Growing Up Absurd]]'' (1960), which brought the theme into real life.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=160}} Goodman said that the book was the action he had wanted for his fictional heroes, the culmination of his therapy, theorizing, alienation, and provocations.<!--Adam/Everyman-->{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=163}} Throughout the 1960s, Goodman focused on social criticism and his therapeutic role in healing the alienated.

But Goodman's [[literary executor]], [[Taylor Stoehr]], likened Goodman's style to [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] most of all.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=151}}\n\nMuch of Goodman's fiction was based on his life{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=151}}<!--note where his material came from?--> and as a result, included self-examination among its themes.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=152}} ''Johnson'' and ''The Break-Up of Our Camp'', written after his college graduation, were based on a romantic interest and Jewish boys' camp where Goodman was a counselor. Some chapters of these novels-in-stories were published in magazines.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=151}}<!-- more on both in source -->\n\nIn the late 1930s, after moving to Chicago, Goodman reconsidered his approach to fiction and wrote a dozen works of prose in a style he termed \"cubist\", in which he abstracted its formal/literary elements as alienated from mere character relations.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|pp=153\u2013154}} Of these stories, \"A Ceremonial\", received the most critical attention, but [[Klaus Mann]] saw serenity where Goodman had intended an alienated tone.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=155}} Goodman received fair recognition within New York literary circles into 1940 as he published in multiple magazines,{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=155}} but many opportunities soon fell through, particularly as Goodman made enemies with his aggressive [[World War II]] pacifism. <!--Goodman's pacifism led him to lambaste his own literary supporters [[James Laughlin]] and [[John Crowe Ransom]] for endorsing the war-->Goodman's Japanese Noh plays, ''Stop-Light'', released a week after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. ''The Grand Piano'', his antiwar novel, fell flat against the [[Philippines campaign (1941\u20131942)|Philippines campaign]]. After publishing little in 1943 and being fired for seducing his students, Goodman was becoming notorious.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=156}}\n\nSmall presses continued to publish his works, but Goodman was bothered by his self-image as an embattled writer alienated from society, both well-published and unknown at once.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|pp=156\u2013157}} While continuing to write over 100 stories, plays, essays, and constant poems throughout the 1940s, Goodman channeled his troubles into his writing and focused on the social issues associated with his alienation\u2014politics, psychosexuality, religion\u2014and wrote on topics including education, anarchism (\"[[The May Pamphlet]]\"), and civic design (''[[Communitas (book)|Communitas]]'').{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=156}} Meanwhile, in his fiction, Goodman's [[epic novel]] project ''[[The Empire City]]'' was an inward-looking satire subtitled \"An Almanac of Alienation\". He wrote it as a series of heroic portraits whose characters were abstractions of \"sociological and psychological causes\". In his short stories, Goodman removed conventional plot, character, and setting as familial essays with his self-styled \"cubist\" literary emphasis on formal manner.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=157}} He called these styles \"expressionistic naturalism\" and \"dialectical lyrics\", respectively, though the literary experiments outgrew the label. He stopped categorizing his career stages upon growing comfortable with his stature in the field.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|pp=157\u2013158}}\n\nIn the mid-1940s, Goodman's stories became more polemical in indignant self-defense of his provocative lifestyle,<!--thin characters; \"moral and psychological fogs\" impenetrable \"without the biographical key\"--> though as he entered therapy, the stories became self-critical and reflective of psychoanalytic ideas. In one work, he remarked that \"disparaging the ego\" and hatred of self were the core theme of his stories. In \"Incidents of the Labyrinth\", an allegory of soul-searching in the myth of the [[Labyrinth]], Goodman recounted how those who search for the [[meaning of life]] (or others who ask those questions) are likely to be unhappy.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=158}} His late-1940s stories were part of his self-analysis (e.g., free analysis and childhood memories) with fewer formal devices, more openings to the unconscious, and clear analogies of inward searching.<!--also ego vs. imagination-->{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|pp=158\u2013159}} \n\nGoodman came to see his fiction as \"myths\" in the 1950s, either by finding something mythical in a traditional American scene or in finding something familiar in an ancient, foreign myth.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|pp=160\u2013161}} In these works, Goodman wrote about rescuers and doctors who save their victims but not themselves.<!-- list below but also see this page for The Death of Aesculapius and An Asclepiad; Jeremy Owen; St. Wayward fifth book of Empire City-->{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=161}} In this period, Goodman moved past motifs of \"divided self\" and towards making whole: \"Relent, remedy\".{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|pp=159\u2013160}} Goodman believed in [[paradise lost]], that the power of healers (to remedy) comes from sacrificing their own health and happiness (to relent).<!-- list of themes in relation to the 50s-->{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=161}} For example, the sailors of \"The Galley to Mytilene\" <!--cut \"down the suicidal inhabitants\"?-->revive the survivors, signifying how after relenting towards himself, Goodman is free to relent towards others (the survivors).{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=160}} The plot of \"relent, remedy\" recurs throughout much of the Goodman's remaining fiction (\"The Death of Aesculapius\", \"Bathers at Westover Pond\"<!--, \"A Lifeguard\", \"A Rescue\"-->) up through his breakthrough work of social criticism, ''[[Growing Up Absurd]]'' (1960), which brought the theme into real life.{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=160}} Goodman said that the book was the action he had wanted for his fictional heroes, the culmination of his therapy, theorizing, alienation, and provocations.<!--Adam/Everyman-->{{sfn|Stoehr|1986|p=163}} Throughout the 1960s, Goodman focused on social criticism and his therapeutic role in healing the alienated.

Eisenhower]] on July 7, 1958, allowing [[Alaska]] to become the 49th [[U.S. state]] on January 3, 1959.\n\n==History==\nFrom 1867 to 1884, [[Alaska]] was considered to be a military district of the [[United States]] under the control of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], known as the [[Department of Alaska]]. From 1884 to 1912, it was designated as the [[District of Alaska]], and from 1912 to 1959, was organized into the incorporated [[Territory of Alaska]]. Alaskans had sought statehood since as early as the 1920s, though this vision was not realized until the decade after [[World War II]].\n\n===The First Organic Act===\nIn 1884, the Department of Alaska was organized into the District of Alaska, when Congress passed the Organic Act allowing for Alaska to become a judicial district as well as a civil one, with judges, clerks, marshals, and limited government officials appointed by the federal government to run the territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=170|title=Alaska History and Cultural Studies|publisher=Alaska Humanities Forum|accessdate=June 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103122630/http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=170|archive-date=2005-01-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> Furthermore, during [[Klondike Gold Rush|the Gold Rush Era]] (1890\u20131900), over 100,000 people traveled north into the Yukon Territory and Alaska in search of gold. Several industries flourished as a result, such as fishing, trapping, mining and mineral production. Alaska's resources were depleted to the extent that it came to be considered a \"colonial economy\". Alaska was still just a district, however, and the local government had little control over local affairs.\n\n===The Second Organic Act===\nSeveral issues arose that made it more difficult for Alaska to push towards self-government. One of these was the formation of the \"Alaska Syndicate\" in 1906 by the two barons [[J. P. Morgan]] and [[Simon Guggenheim]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Southcentral Alaska 1900-1915 FIGHT FOR A RAILROAD|url=http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=87|website=Alaska History and Cultural Studies|accessdate=2014-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328221404/http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=87|archive-date=2015-03-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their influence spread and they came to control the Kennecott copper mine, steamship and railroad companies, and salmon packing. The influence of the Syndicate in Washington D.C. opposed any further movement towards Alaskan home rule. [[James Wickersham]], however, grew increasingly concerned over the exploitation of Alaska for personal and corporate interests and took it upon himself to fight for Alaskan self-rule. He used the [[Pinchot\u2013Ballinger controversy|Ballinger\u2013Pinchot affair]] in order to help achieve this. As a result of the affair, Alaska was on the national headlines, and President [[William Howard Taft]] was forced to send a message to Congress on February 2, 1912, insisting that they listen to Wickersham. In August 1912 Congress passed the Second Organic Act, which established the [[Territory of Alaska]] as a [[U.S. territory]], with a capital at Juneau and an elected legislature.<ref>An Act to create a legislative assembly in the Territory of Alaska, to confer legislative power thereon, and for other purposes, 62nd Congress, 2nd Session, ch. 387 (Public Law No. 334), [https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/62nd-congress/session-2/c62s2ch387.pdf 37 Stat. 512] (August 24, 1912).</ref> The federal government still retained much of the control over laws regarding fishing, gaming, and natural resources and the governor was also still appointed by the President. In 1916, Wickersham, who was now a delegate to Congress, proposed the first bill for Alaskan statehood. The bill, however, failed, partly due to domestic disinterest among Alaskans in gaining statehood.\n\n===National and Congressional discrimination===\nDiscrimination against the Alaskan Territory made it difficult for Congress to get much done. Discussion of revising the Second Organic Act took up much time but came to no avail. Instead, Congress passed the Jones Act (also known as the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920]]) and the White Act of 1924 both of which made the fishing problem worse for Alaskans rather than better. Alaskans were angered by these two acts and felt they were discriminatory. Matters were made worse by regional conflicts which drew attention away from the issue of statehood. In the 1930s, Alaska was plagued by the Depression. During this time, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] did two significant things for Alaska. First, he allowed for 1,000 selected farmers hurt by the depression to move to Alaska and colonize the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]], being given a second chance at agricultural success. Second and more importantly, Roosevelt appointed [[Ernest Gruening]] as governor of Alaska in 1939. [[Bob Bartlett|Edward Lewis \"Bob\" Bartlett]], who was one of Alaska's territorial delegates to Congress from 1944 to 1958 when he became a U.S. senator representing Alaska, would become one of Gruening's most important allies in supporting the cause for Alaskan statehood.\n\n===Breaking down the barriers toward statehood===\nAlaska's desire for statehood was much aided by the amount of attention it received during World War II.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cloe |first1=John |title=The Cold War Years 1946 - 1991 |url=https://alaskahistoricalsociety.org/discover-alaska/glimpses-of-the-past/the-cold-war-years-1946-1991/ |website=Alaska Historical Society |publisher=Alaska Historical Society |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref> After Japan initiated the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] in June 1942, the territory became an important strategic military base and a key to the Pacific during the war, and its population increased with the number of American servicemen sent there. It remained critically important in deterring Soviet aggression through the [[Bering Strait]] during the [[Cold War]]. However, many barriers still stood between Alaska and statehood. Many Alaskans, like the [[Lomen Company|Lomen brothers]] of [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] and [[Austin E. Lathrop|Austin E. \"Cap\" Lathrop]], who benefited largely from Alaska's small tax base, did not want themselves or their businesses to be hurt financially by the increase in taxes that would result from statehood. Other Alaskans feared that statehood would result in a flood of more people coming to Alaska, which they didn't want. There was enough of a majority, though, that did want statehood so as to be able to pass a referendum for statehood in Alaska in 1946 by a 3:2 vote.\n\n===The opposition===\nWith the help of the referendum, Bartlett was able to introduce a bill to Congress. The bill, however, was immediately shot down by a coalition of Democrats and Republicans. (Republicans feared that Alaska would be unable to raise enough taxes due to its small population, and end up as a welfare state. The Southern Democrats feared more pro-civil rights congressmen.) To retaliate, Gruening established the \"Alaska Statehood Committee\" in 1949. He encouraged journalists, newspaper editors, politicians, and members of national and labor organizations to help use their positions and power to make the issue of Alaskan statehood more known.

Eisenhower]] on July 7, 1958, allowing [[Alaska]] to become the 49th [[U.S. state]] on January 3, 1959.\n\n==History==\nFrom 1867 to 1884, [[Alaska]] was considered to be a military district of the [[United States]] under the control of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], known as the [[Department of Alaska]]. From 1884 to 1912, it was designated as the [[District of Alaska]], and from 1912 to 1959, was organized into the incorporated [[Territory of Alaska]]. Alaskans had sought statehood since as early as the 1920s, though this vision was not realized until the decade after [[World War II]].\n\n===The First Organic Act===\nIn 1884, the Department of Alaska was organized into the District of Alaska, when Congress passed the Organic Act allowing for Alaska to become a judicial district as well as a civil one, with judges, clerks, marshals, and limited government officials appointed by the federal government to run the territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=170|title=Alaska History and Cultural Studies|publisher=Alaska Humanities Forum|accessdate=June 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103122630/http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=170|archive-date=2005-01-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> Furthermore, during [[Klondike Gold Rush|the Gold Rush Era]] (1890\u20131900), over 100,000 people traveled north into the Yukon Territory and Alaska in search of gold. Several industries flourished as a result, such as fishing, trapping, mining and mineral production. Alaska's resources were depleted to the extent that it came to be considered a \"colonial economy\". Alaska was still just a district, however, and the local government had little control over local affairs.\n\n===The Second Organic Act===\nSeveral issues arose that made it more difficult for Alaska to push towards self-government. One of these was the formation of the \"Alaska Syndicate\" in 1906 by the two barons [[J. P. Morgan]] and [[Simon Guggenheim]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Southcentral Alaska 1900-1915 FIGHT FOR A RAILROAD|url=http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=87|website=Alaska History and Cultural Studies|accessdate=2014-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328221404/http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=87|archive-date=2015-03-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their influence spread and they came to control the Kennecott copper mine, steamship and railroad companies, and salmon packing. The influence of the Syndicate in Washington D.C. opposed any further movement towards Alaskan home rule. [[James Wickersham]], however, grew increasingly concerned over the exploitation of Alaska for personal and corporate interests and took it upon himself to fight for Alaskan self-rule. He used the [[Pinchot\u2013Ballinger controversy|Ballinger\u2013Pinchot affair]] in order to help achieve this. As a result of the affair, Alaska was on the national headlines, and President [[William Howard Taft]] was forced to send a message to Congress on February 2, 1912, insisting that they listen to Wickersham. In August 1912 Congress passed the Second Organic Act, which established the [[Territory of Alaska]] as a [[U.S. territory]], with a capital at Juneau and an elected legislature.<ref>An Act to create a legislative assembly in the Territory of Alaska to confer legislative power thereon, and for other purposes, 62nd Congress, 2nd Session, ch. 387 (Public Law No. 334), [https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/62nd-congress/session-2/c62s2ch387.pdf 37 Stat. 512] (August 24, 1912).</ref> The federal government still retained much of the control over laws regarding fishing, gaming, and natural resources and the governor was also still appointed by the President. In 1916, Wickersham, who was now a delegate to Congress, proposed the first bill for Alaskan statehood. The bill, however, failed, partly due to domestic disinterest among Alaskans in gaining statehood.\n\n===National and Congressional discrimination===\nDiscrimination against the Alaskan Territory made it difficult for Congress to get much done. Discussion of revising the Second Organic Act took up much time but came to no avail. Instead, Congress passed the Jones Act (also known as the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920]]) and the White Act of 1924 both of which made the fishing problem worse for Alaskans rather than better. Alaskans were angered by these two acts and felt they were discriminatory. Matters were made worse by regional conflicts which drew attention away from the issue of statehood. In the 1930s, Alaska was plagued by the Depression. During this time, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] did two significant things for Alaska. First, he allowed for 1,000 selected farmers hurt by the depression to move to Alaska and colonize the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]], being given a second chance at agricultural success. Second and more importantly, Roosevelt appointed [[Ernest Gruening]] as governor of Alaska in 1939. [[Bob Bartlett|Edward Lewis \"Bob\" Bartlett]], who was one of Alaska's territorial delegates to Congress from 1944 to 1958 when he became a U.S. senator representing Alaska, would become one of Gruening's most important allies in supporting the cause for Alaskan statehood.\n\n===Breaking down the barriers toward statehood===\nAlaska's desire for statehood was much aided by the amount of attention it received during World War II.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cloe |first1=John |title=The Cold War Years 1946 - 1991 |url=https://alaskahistoricalsociety.org/discover-alaska/glimpses-of-the-past/the-cold-war-years-1946-1991/ |website=Alaska Historical Society |publisher=Alaska Historical Society |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref> After Japan initiated the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] in June 1942, the territory became an important strategic military base and a key to the Pacific during the war, and its population increased with the number of American servicemen sent there. It remained critically important in deterring Soviet aggression through the [[Bering Strait]] during the [[Cold War]]. However, many barriers still stood between Alaska and statehood. Many Alaskans, like the [[Lomen Company|Lomen brothers]] of [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] and [[Austin E. Lathrop|Austin E. \"Cap\" Lathrop]], who benefited largely from Alaska's small tax base, did not want themselves or their businesses to be hurt financially by the increase in taxes that would result from statehood. Other Alaskans feared that statehood would result in a flood of more people coming to Alaska, which they didn't want. There was enough of a majority, though, that did want statehood so as to be able to pass a referendum for statehood in Alaska in 1946 by a 3:2 vote.\n\n===The opposition===\nWith the help of the referendum, Bartlett was able to introduce a bill to Congress. The bill, however, was immediately shot down by a coalition of Democrats and Republicans. (Republicans feared that Alaska would be unable to raise enough taxes due to its small population, and end up as a welfare state. The Southern Democrats feared more pro-civil rights congressmen.) To retaliate, Gruening established the \"Alaska Statehood Committee\" in 1949. He encouraged journalists, newspaper editors, politicians, and members of national and labor organizations to help use their positions and power to make the issue of Alaskan statehood more known. He gathered a group of 100 prominent figures, including [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], actor [[James Cagney]], [[Pearl S. Buck]], [[John Gunther]], historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr]]. and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], who all stood for the Alaskan cause. Another bill was introduced to Congress in 1949 and passed in the House by a 186 to 146 vote in 1950. However, the bill was then shot down in the Senate, again for fear of adding more Democrats to the 81st Congress (1949\u20131951) Democratic (54 seats) Republican (42 seats).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/one_item_and_teasers/partydiv.htm|title=Party Division in the Senate}}</ref> On February 27, 1952, the Senate by a one-vote margin (45-44) killed the statehood bill for another year.
