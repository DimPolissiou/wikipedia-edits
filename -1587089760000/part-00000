It was released in theaters on November 25, 2009 and was released on DVD March 9, 2010.\n\nThe movie is dedicated to both Bernie Mac (who died in August 2008 and had his final acting role in the film) and Jett Travolta (John Travolta's son who died in January 2009). The film was panned by critics and grossed $96.7 million worldwide on a $35 million budget.<ref name=\"doggross\"/><!--THE GROSS IS SHOWN TO BE NEARLY TRIPLE THAT OF THE BUDGET--> At the [[30th Golden Raspberry Awards]] ceremony, ''Old Dogs'' was nominated in four categories: Worst Picture, Worst Actor for John Travolta, Worst Supporting Actress for Kelly Preston and Worst Director for Walt Becker.\n\nCanadian rocker [[Bryan Adams]] wrote the theme song for the film, \"[[You've Been a Friend to Me]]\".\n\n==Plot==\nDan Rayburn ([[Robin Williams]]) and Charlie Reed ([[John Travolta]]) are best friends and co-owners of a successful sports marketing firm. Seven years prior, Dan, recently divorced, married Vicki ([[Kelly Preston]]) after being whisked away by Charlie for a tropical vacation. The marriage, however, is short lived. Seven years later, Vicki resurfaces to tell Dan that their short marriage resulted in something he never suspected: twins Zach (Conner Rayburn) and Emily (Ella Bleu Travolta).\n\nVicki, facing jail time for her work as an environmental activist, asks Dan to take care of the kids while she does her time. Thinking this might be his chance to get back with Vicki, Dan agrees, but only if Charlie will help him since neither have any experience taking care of kids. At the same time, the two must finalize a huge marketing deal with a Japanese company, something they've always dreamed of, but will take all of their talents to clinch.\n\nBecause Dan's condo does not allow children, he has to board with Charlie. Whilst this is happening, Charlie and Dan are close to securing the biggest account in the history of their careers with the Japanese corporation. Charlie and Dan's attempts to take care of the kids are well-intentioned, but very misguided. On a trip with the kids to an overnight camp, a hard-nosed camp instructor ([[Matt Dillon]]) becomes convinced that Dan and Charlie are homosexual partners. The trip ends with a bang after Dan accidentally sets a beloved statue of the camp's founder on fire.\n\nThe kids then proceed to spill and replace Charlie and Dan's prescriptions, mixing them up in the process. Dan then must play a game of golf with the Japanese executives while experiencing extreme side effects and Charlie tries to woo Amanda ([[Lori Loughlin]]) with a face frozen by the pills.\n\nDesperate to help Dan communicate with the children despite his inexperience with children, Charlie recruits his friend Jimmy Lunchbox ([[Bernie Mac]]), a [[Effeminacy|flamboyant]] children's entertainer, who is famous around the world. Jimmy comes by and straps Dan and Charlie in motion control puppet suits so Charlie can help Dan make all the right moves with his daughter while having a tea party. The suits malfunction, but Dan speaks from the heart, winning over Emily but his speech makes Jimmy emotional. Everything is great with Vicki as she returns home upon having served time in jail. However, the guys have sealed their Japanese deal, sending junior associate Craig ([[Seth Green]]) to Tokyo. When Craig goes missing after arriving there, Charlie and Dan must fly to Tokyo themselves to work. Dan must leave the kids and Vicki despite his (and their) desire to be a family.\n\nOnce in Tokyo, Dan realizes that what he really wants is to be a good father. He leaves the meeting without sealing the deal, rushing with Charlie to Vermont for the kids' birthday party. They aren't able to get into the Burlington Zoo in time and are forced to break in with the help of Craig. However, they mistakenly wind up in the [[gorilla]] enclosure. Though Dan and Charlie escape, Craig is captured by the gorilla (which takes a strong liking to him).\n\nDan then pays a birthday party performer hired by Vicki to use his jet pack and suit, flies into the ceremony and wins his kids back over. When the jet pack stops working in mid-air, he is taken to an ambulance on a stretcher. One year later, Dan and Vicki are together, Charlie has married Amanda, and Craig has become like a new \"uncle\" to the kids.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Travolta]] as Charlie Reed\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Daniel \"Dan\" Rayburn\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Vicki Greer\n* Ella Bleu Travolta as Emily Greer\n* [[Lori Loughlin]] as Amanda\n* [[Seth Green]] as Craig White\n* [[Rita Wilson]] as Jenna\n* [[Bernie Mac]] as Jimmy Lunchbox\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Troop Leader Barry\n* [[Justin Long]] as Troop Leader Adam (''uncredited'')\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Child Proofer Gary (''uncredited'')\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Child Proofer Nick (''uncredited'')\n* [[Sab Shimono]] as Yoshiro Nishamura\n* Kevin W.

It was released in theaters on November 25, 2009 and was released on DVD March 9, 2010.\n\nThe movie is dedicated to both Bernie Mac (who died in August 2008 and had his final acting role in the film) and Jett Travolta (John Travolta's son who died in January 2009). The film was panned by critics and grossed $96.7 million worldwide on a $35 million budget.<ref name=\"doggross\"/><!--THE GROSS IS SHOWN TO BE NEARLY TRIPLE THAT OF THE BUDGET-->\n\nCanadian rocker [[Bryan Adams]] wrote the theme song for the film, \"[[You've Been a Friend to Me]]\".\n\nAt the [[30th Golden Raspberry Awards]] ceremony, ''Old Dogs'' was nominated in four categories: Worst Picture, Worst Actor for John Travolta, Worst Supporting Actress for Kelly Preston and Worst Director for Walt Becker.\n\n==Plot==\nDan Rayburn ([[Robin Williams]]) and Charlie Reed ([[John Travolta]]) are best friends and co-owners of a successful sports marketing firm. Seven years prior, Dan, recently divorced, married Vicki ([[Kelly Preston]]) after being whisked away by Charlie for a tropical vacation. The marriage, however, is short lived. Seven years later, Vicki resurfaces to tell Dan that their short marriage resulted in something he never suspected: twins Zach (Conner Rayburn) and Emily (Ella Bleu Travolta).\n\nVicki, facing jail time for her work as an environmental activist, asks Dan to take care of the kids while she does her time. Thinking this might be his chance to get back with Vicki, Dan agrees, but only if Charlie will help him since neither have any experience taking care of kids. At the same time, the two must finalize a huge marketing deal with a Japanese company, something they've always dreamed of, but will take all of their talents to clinch.\n\nBecause Dan's condo does not allow children, he has to board with Charlie. Whilst this is happening, Charlie and Dan are close to securing the biggest account in the history of their careers with the Japanese corporation. Charlie and Dan's attempts to take care of the kids are well-intentioned, but very misguided. On a trip with the kids to an overnight camp, a hard-nosed camp instructor ([[Matt Dillon]]) becomes convinced that Dan and Charlie are homosexual partners. The trip ends with a bang after Dan accidentally sets a beloved statue of the camp's founder on fire.\n\nThe kids then proceed to spill and replace Charlie and Dan's prescriptions, mixing them up in the process. Dan then must play a game of golf with the Japanese executives while experiencing extreme side effects and Charlie tries to woo Amanda ([[Lori Loughlin]]) with a face frozen by the pills.\n\nDesperate to help Dan communicate with the children despite his inexperience with children, Charlie recruits his friend Jimmy Lunchbox ([[Bernie Mac]]), a [[Effeminacy|flamboyant]] children's entertainer, who is famous around the world. Jimmy comes by and straps Dan and Charlie in motion control puppet suits so Charlie can help Dan make all the right moves with his daughter while having a tea party. The suits malfunction, but Dan speaks from the heart, winning over Emily but his speech makes Jimmy emotional. Everything is great with Vicki as she returns home upon having served time in jail. However, the guys have sealed their Japanese deal, sending junior associate Craig ([[Seth Green]]) to Tokyo. When Craig goes missing after arriving there, Charlie and Dan must fly to Tokyo themselves to work. Dan must leave the kids and Vicki despite his (and their) desire to be a family.\n\nOnce in Tokyo, Dan realizes that what he really wants is to be a good father. He leaves the meeting without sealing the deal, rushing with Charlie to Vermont for the kids' birthday party. They aren't able to get into the Burlington Zoo in time and are forced to break in with the help of Craig. However, they mistakenly wind up in the [[gorilla]] enclosure. Though Dan and Charlie escape, Craig is captured by the gorilla (which takes a strong liking to him).\n\nDan then pays a birthday party performer hired by Vicki to use his jet pack and suit, flies into the ceremony and wins his kids back over. When the jet pack stops working in mid-air, he is taken to an ambulance on a stretcher. One year later, Dan and Vicki are together, Charlie has married Amanda, and Craig has become like a new \"uncle\" to the kids.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Travolta]] as Charlie Reed\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Daniel \"Dan\" Rayburn\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Vicki Greer\n* Ella Bleu Travolta as Emily Greer\n* [[Lori Loughlin]] as Amanda\n* [[Seth Green]] as Craig White\n* [[Rita Wilson]] as Jenna\n* [[Bernie Mac]] as Jimmy Lunchbox\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Troop Leader Barry\n* [[Justin Long]] as Troop Leader Adam (''uncredited'')\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Child Proofer Gary (''uncredited'')\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Child Proofer Nick (''uncredited'')\n* [[Sab Shimono]] as Yoshiro Nishamura\n* Kevin W.

The base of the emblem represents the country's lush, green landscape, decorated with oak leaves. A symbol of strength, the native oak has been venerated in Lithuania for centuries. Following the lines of the FIFA Futsal World Cup Trophy, oaks give way to farmland and meadows in the colours of the Lithuanian flag. The prominence given to the landscape highlights Lithuania's commitment to the preservation of its natural heritage.\n\nThe top half of the emblem is inspired by Lithuania's modern technological industries. Lasers shoot skywards towards a stylised futsal pitch as a reminder of the country's accomplishments in the science and high-tech industries.\n\nThe Mascot and Slogan will be unveiled in early 2020.\n\n==Squads==\n{{main|2020 FIFA Futsal World Cup squads}}\n\n==Group stage==\nThe top two teams of each group and the four best third-placed teams advance to the round of 16.\n\nAll times are

Sailing [[yacht]]s are actively used in sport and are among categories recognized by the governing body of sailing sports, [[World Sailing]].<ref>[http://www.sailing.org/classes/#isaf_sliding_tab_item_classes_index_yacht World Sailing classes of yachts].</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe history of pleasure boats begins with rowed craft in Pharaonic Egyptian times. The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors.
