Various programs were developed with the aim of promoting safe sex practices among college students. These programs were focused on promoting the use of the condom, a better knowledge about the partner's sexual history and limiting the number of [[sexual partner]]s. The first book on this subject appeared in the same year. The book was entitled \"Safe Sex in the Age of AIDS\", it had 88 pages and it described both positive and negative approaches to sexual life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Sexual behavior could be either safe ([[kiss]]ing, [[hug]]ging, [[massage]], [[Non-penetrative sex|body-to-body rubbing]], [[mutual masturbation]], [[exhibitionism]], [[phone sex]], and use of separate [[sex toy]]s); possibly safe (use of condoms); and unsafe.<ref name=\"A\"/>\n\nIn 1997, specialists in this matter promoted the use of condoms as the most accessible safe sex method (besides abstinence) and they called for [[TV commercials]] featuring condoms. During the same year, the [[Catholic Church]] in the United States issued their own \"safer sex\" guidelines on which condoms were listed, though two years later the [[Holy See|Vatican]] urged [[chastity]] and [[heterosexual]] marriage, attacking the American Catholic bishops' guidelines.\n\nA study carried out in 2006 by Californian specialists showed that the most common definitions of safe sex are condom use (68% of the interviewed subjects), abstinence (31.1% of the interviewed subjects), monogamy (28.4% of the interviewed subjects) and safe partner (18.7% of the interviewed subjects).<ref name=\"A\"/>\n\nThe term ''safer sex'' in Canada and the United States has gained greater use by health workers, reflecting that risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections in various [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] is a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]].

PrEP drugs are taken ''prior'' to HIV exposure to prevent the transmission of the virus, usually between sexual partners. PrEP drugs do not prevent other STI infections or pregnancy.\n\nAs of 2018, the most-widely approved form of ''PrEP'' combines two drugs (tenofovir and emtricitabine) in one pill. That drug combination is sold under the brand name Truvada by Gilead Sciences. It is also sold in generic formulations worldwide. Other drugs are also being studied for use as PrEP.\n\nDifferent countries have approved different protocols for using the tenofovir/emtricitabine-combination drug as ''PrEP''. That two-drug combination has been shown to prevent HIV infection in different populations when taken daily, intermittently, and on demand. Numerous studies have found the tenofovir/emtricitabine combination to be over 90% effective at preventing HIV transmission between sexual partners.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep/ |title=Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) |date=19 September 2016 |website= |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=14 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Treatment as prevention ===\n{{Main|Treatment as prevention}}\nTreatment as Prevention (often abbreviated as ''TasP'') is the practice of testing for and treating HIV infection as a way to prevent further spread of the virus. Those having knowledge of their HIV-positive status can use safe-sex practices to protect themselves and their partners (such as using condoms, sero-sorting partners, or choosing less-risky sexual activities). And, because HIV-positive people with durably suppressed or undetectable amounts of HIV in their blood ''cannot transmit HIV to sexual partners'', sexual activity with HIV-positive partners on effective treatment is a form of safe sex (to prevent HIV infection). This fact has given rise to the concept of \"U=U\" (\"Undetectable = Untransmittable\").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.preventionaccess.org/ |title=U=U|date=2017|website= |publisher=Prevention Access Campaign|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Other forms of safe sex===\nOther methods proven effective at reducing STI risks during sexual activity are:\n* [[Immunization]] against certain sexually-transmitted viruses. The most common vaccines protect against [[Hepatitis B vaccine|Hepatitis B]] and [[HPV vaccine|Human papilloma virus (HPV)]], which can cause [[cervical cancer]], [[penile cancer]], [[oral cancer]], and [[genital warts]]. Immunization before initiation of sexual activity increases effectiveness of these vaccines. HPV vaccines are recommended for all teen girls and women as well as teen boys and men through age 26 and 21 respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm|title=Prevention - STD Information from CDC|date=2019-05-28|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref>  \n* Limiting numbers of sexual partners, particularly casual sexual partners, or restricting sexual activity to those who know and share their STI status, can also reduce STI risks. [[Monogamy]] or [[polyfidelity]], practiced faithfully, is very safe (as far as STIs are concerned) when all partners are non-infected. However, many monogamous people have been infected with sexually transmitted diseases by partners who are [[Adultery|sexually unfaithful]], have used injection drugs, or were infected by previous sexual partners. The same risks apply to polyfidelitous people, who face higher risks depending on how many people are in the polyfidelitous group.\n* [[Communication]] with sexual partners about sexual history and STI status, preferred safe sex practices, and acceptable risks for partnered sexual activities.\n* Engaging in less-risky sexual activities. In general, solo sexual activities are less risky than partnered activities. Sexual penetration of orifices (mouth, vagina, anus) and sharing body fluids (such as semen, blood, vaginal fluids, and rectal mucus) between sexual partners carry the most risk for STIs. \n* Regular STI testing and treatment, especially by those who are sexually active with more than one casual sexual partner.<ref name=Kahn>{{cite journal | last = Kahn | first = J.

It specifically named illnesses (Kaposi's sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia) that would later be understood as symptoms of advanced HIV disease (or [[AIDS]]). The pamphlet advocated a range of safe-sex practices, including abstinence, condoms, personal hygiene, use of personal lubricants, and STI testing/treatment. It took a casual, sex-positive approach while also emphasizing personal and social responsibility. In May 1983\u2014the same month HIV was isolated and named in France\u2014the New York City-based HIV/AIDS activists Richard Berkowitz and Michael Callen published similar advice in their booklet, ''[[How to Have Sex in an Epidemic: One Approach]]''.

Various programs were developed with the aim of promoting safe sex practices among college students. These programs were focused on promoting the use of the condom, a better knowledge about the partner's sexual history and limiting the number of [[sexual partner]]s. The first book on this subject appeared in the same year. The book was entitled \"Safe Sex in the Age of AIDS\", it had 88 pages and it described both positive and negative approaches to sexual life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Sexual behavior could be either safe ([[kiss]]ing, [[hug]]ging, [[massage]], [[Non-penetrative sex|body-to-body rubbing]], [[mutual masturbation]], [[exhibitionism]], [[phone sex]], and use of separate [[sex toy]]s); possibly safe (use of condoms); and unsafe.<ref name=\"A\"/>\n\nIn 1997, specialists in this matter promoted the use of condoms as the most accessible safe sex method (besides abstinence) and they called for [[TV commercials]] featuring condoms. During the same year, the [[Catholic Church]] in the United States issued their own \"safer sex\" guidelines on which condoms were listed, though two years later the [[Holy See|Vatican]] urged [[chastity]] and [[heterosexual]] marriage, attacking the American Catholic bishops' guidelines.\n\nA study carried out in 2006 by Californian specialists showed that the most common definitions of safe sex are condom use (68% of the interviewed subjects), abstinence (31.1% of the interviewed subjects), monogamy (28.4% of the interviewed subjects) and safe partner (18.7% of the interviewed subjects).<ref name=\"A\"/>\n\nThe term ''safer sex'' in Canada and the United States has gained greater use by health workers, reflecting that risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections in various [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] is a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]].

PrEP drugs are taken ''prior'' to HIV exposure to prevent the transmission of the virus, usually between sexual partners. PrEP drugs do not prevent other STI infections or pregnancy.\n\nAs of 2018, the most-widely approved form of ''PrEP'' combines two drugs (tenofovir and emtricitabine) in one pill. That drug combination is sold under the brand name Truvada by Gilead Sciences. It is also sold in generic formulations worldwide. Other drugs are also being studied for use as PrEP.\n\nDifferent countries have approved different protocols for using the tenofovir/emtricitabine-combination drug as ''PrEP''. That two-drug combination has been shown to prevent HIV infection in different populations when taken daily, intermittently, and on demand. Numerous studies have found the tenofovir/emtricitabine combination to be over 90% effective at preventing HIV transmission between sexual partners.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep/ |title=Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) |date=19 September 2016 |website= |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=14 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Treatment as prevention ===\n{{Main|Treatment as prevention}}\nTreatment as Prevention (often abbreviated as ''TasP'') is the practice of testing for and treating HIV infection as a way to prevent further spread of the virus. Those having knowledge of their HIV-positive status can use safe-sex practices to protect themselves and their partners (such as using condoms, sero-sorting partners, or choosing less-risky sexual activities). And, because HIV-positive people with durably suppressed or undetectable amounts of HIV in their blood ''cannot transmit HIV to sexual partners'', sexual activity with HIV-positive partners on effective treatment is a form of safe sex (to prevent HIV infection). This fact has given rise to the concept of \"U=U\" (\"Undetectable = Untransmittable\").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.preventionaccess.org/ |title=U=U|date=2017|website= |publisher=Prevention Access Campaign|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Other forms of safe sex===\nOther methods proven effective at reducing STI risks during sexual activity are:\n* [[Immunization]] against certain sexually-transmitted viruses. The most common vaccines protect against [[Hepatitis B vaccine|Hepatitis B]] and [[HPV vaccine|Human papilloma virus (HPV)]], which can cause [[cervical cancer]], [[penile cancer]], [[oral cancer]], and [[genital warts]]. Immunization before initiation of sexual activity increases effectiveness of these vaccines. HPV vaccines are recommended for all teen girls and women as well as teen boys and men through age 26 and 21 respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/default.htm|title=Prevention - STD Information from CDC|date=2019-05-28|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref>  \n* Limiting numbers of sexual partners, particularly casual sexual partners, or restricting sexual activity to those who know and share their STI status, can also reduce STI risks. [[Monogamy]] or [[polyfidelity]], practiced faithfully, is very safe (as far as STIs are concerned) when all partners are non-infected. However, many monogamous people have been infected with sexually transmitted diseases by partners who are [[Adultery|sexually unfaithful]], have used injection drugs, or were infected by previous sexual partners. The same risks apply to polyfidelitous people, who face higher risks depending on how many people are in the polyfidelitous group.\n* [[Communication]] with sexual partners about sexual history and STI status, preferred safe sex practices, and acceptable risks for partnered sexual activities.\n* Engaging in less-risky sexual activities. In general, solo sexual activities are less risky than partnered activities. Sexual penetration of orifices (mouth, vagina, anus) and sharing body fluids (such as semen, blood, vaginal fluids, and rectal mucus) between sexual partners carry the most risk for STIs. \n* Regular STI testing and treatment, especially by those who are sexually active with more than one casual sexual partner.<ref name=Kahn>{{cite journal | last = Kahn | first = J.

Directed by [[James Mangold]], it stars [[Winona Ryder]] (who also served as an executive producer) as Kaysen, with a supporting cast including [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Clea DuVall]], [[Brittany Murphy]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Elisabeth Moss]], and [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\n''Girl, Interrupted'' began a limited release on December 21, 1999, with a wide expansion on January 14, 2000. Although it received mixed reviews from critics, Jolie's performance received critical acclaim and won her the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]], the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture]], and the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role]].\n\n==Plot==\nAfter 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen has a [[Mental disorder|nervous breakdown]] and overdoses, she is checked into a psychiatric hospital, Claymoore. Previously, she had an affair with her high school English teacher and a casual relationship with a boy, Tobias. On the ward, she befriends Polly Clark, a childlike [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]]; Georgina Tuskin, a [[Pathological lying|pathological liar]] and Susanna's roommate; and Daisy Randone, who [[self-harm]]s and has [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]]. She is drawn to [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] Lisa Rowe, who is rebellious but charismatic and encourages Susanna to stop taking her medication and resist therapy.\n\nLisa has been at Claymoore for eight years, and knows how to manipulate the system. She helps the girls sneak around at night, as well as constantly provokes them and the staff. One day, Tobias visits Susanna, begging her to run away with him. She tells him she has become friends with the other girls and would like to leave someday, just not with him. One day, Lisa convinces Susanna to escape with her, and they run away to Daisy's home. Daisy has been recently discharged and is living in a house provided by her adoring father. After Lisa taunts Daisy for enjoying the sexual abuse she suffers from her father, Susanna finds Daisy dead the next morning, having apparently slit her wrists and hanged herself. Susanna is appalled when Lisa searches Daisy's room and body for cash. Realizing she does not want to become like Lisa, she phones for an ambulance and returns to Claymoore.\n\nSusanna works on her painting and writing, and cooperates with her therapy. Before she is released, Lisa is returned to Claymoore. She steals Susanna's diary and reads it for the amusement of the patients, turning them against Susanna. After reading an entry in which Susanna feels sympathy for Lisa being a cold, dark person, Lisa attacks Susanna, who then runs. After Susanna confronts her, Lisa breaks down and attempts to commit suicide, but the patients dissuade her from doing so. Before Susanna is released the next day, she goes to see Lisa. Susanna reflects that she will remember Claymoore forever.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as [[Susanna Kaysen]], the protagonist.

It is later revealed in Polly's file that she was the victim of a house fire.\n* [[Angela Bettis]] as Janet Webber, an [[anorexia nervosa|anorexic]]. Like Lisa, she is abrasive and seemingly aloof, but is also easily irritated or upset. She is twenty years old.\n* [[Jillian Armenante]] as Cynthia Crowley.

After reading the book, Ryder immediately tried to secure the rights; however, they had been purchased by [[Douglas Wick]] a week earlier. Ryder then decided to team up with Wick along with her manager Carol Bodie, who acted as executive producer along with Ryder. Ryder also stated that she tried hard to persuade [[James Mangold]] to direct the film, who was reluctant at first. She states that she knew Mangold was the right director after she saw his directorial debut ''[[Heavy (film)|Heavy]]'', which explored similar themes to ''Girl, Interrupted''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Filming==\nFilming took place along [[Main Street]] in [[Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania]], as well as in [[Harrisburg State Hospital]] in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]. Mechanicsburg was chosen for its old-fashioned appearance and its old-style drugstore simply titled \"Drugs\", all of which gave the film its time-dated appearance.

Ryder also stated that she tried hard to persuade [[James Mangold]] to direct the film, who was reluctant at first. She states that she knew Mangold was the right director after she saw his directorial debut ''[[Heavy (film)|Heavy]]'', which explored similar themes to ''Girl, Interrupted''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Filming==\nFilming took place along [[Main Street]] in [[Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania]], as well as in [[Harrisburg State Hospital]] in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].

The cast also includes [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Giovanni Ribisi]], [[Hilary Swank]], [[Katie Holmes]], and [[Greg Kinnear]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the town of Brixton, Georgia, widow Annie Wilson ([[Cate Blanchett]]) is a [[clairvoyant]] fortune-teller. Jessica King ([[Katie Holmes]]), the fianc\u00e9e of the local school's principal, Wayne Collins ([[Greg Kinnear]]), disappears.\n\nAnnie receives a vision revealing that Jessica has been killed and her corpse thrown into a pond. She informs local sheriff Pearl Johnson ([[J.K. Simmons]]) of her vision, and despite his skepticism, Johnson searches a pond at the home of Donnie Barksdale ([[Keanu Reeves]]), the abusive husband of one of Annie's clients, Valerie ([[Hilary Swank]]). Donnie had previously threatened Annie and her three children after Annie advised Valerie to leave him. Valerie permits the search while Donnie is absent, but he returns while the search is proceeding. The police find Jessica's corpse in the pond and Donnie is arrested for her murder.\n\nDuring his trial for Jessica's murder, it is revealed that Jessica and Donnie had an affair. Donnie is convicted and sent to prison. Buddy Cole ([[Giovanni Ribisi]]), a mentally ill acquaintance of Annie's, harbors a hatred for his father, and tries to explain to Annie why, but Annie is preoccupied and refuses to listen. That evening, Buddy's mother calls Annie to come to their house, as Buddy has snapped and has his father bound to a chair. Buddy sets his father on fire, and it is revealed that Buddy's father [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] him as a child. Buddy is eventually taken to a mental hospital.\n\nLater, Annie receives another vision revealing that Donnie is innocent. She asks prosecutor David Duncan ([[Gary Cole]]) to reopen the case. After Duncan declines, Annie counters that if he does not do so she will reveal David and Jessica's affair, which she witnessed. Duncan attempts to bribe Annie in exchange for her silence, but Annie refuses.\n\nAnnie tells Wayne that Donnie is not responsible for Jessica's death, and that Duncan will not reopen the investigation. At Wayne's suggestion, he and Annie drive out to the pond that night, where Annie learns from a vision that Wayne is actually the murderer. Wayne confesses to Annie that he was angry after he discovered that Jessica was cheating on him with Donnie. Wayne attempts to kill Annie by striking her in the head with a flashlight, but Buddy appears and knocks him out. Annie and Buddy lock the unconscious Wayne in the trunk of Annie's car.\n\nTo stop her head wound from bleeding, Buddy uses a baby's bib that Annie had lent him earlier. The two drive to the police station. Annie tells Buddy that he will have to return to the mental hospital, and he waits in the car while she enters the station. When she returns to the car with the police, Buddy has disappeared. When Annie explains to Johnson what happened at the pond, he informs her that Buddy could not have aided her, as he had committed suicide at the mental hospital earlier that day.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Annabelle \"Annie\" Wilson\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as Buddy Cole\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Donnie Barksdale\n* [[Katie Holmes]] as Jessica King\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Wayne Collins\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as Valerie Barksdale\n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Gerald Weems\n* [[Kim Dickens]] as Linda\n* [[Gary Cole]] as David Duncan\n* [[Rosemary Harris]] as Annie's grandmother\n* [[J.K.

In 1992, the FIS recognized roller skiing as a sport distinct from cross-country skiing.\n\nThe first [[World Games]] were held in [[The Hague]] in 1993, and the first World Cup roller ski races later in the same year. In 1998, in [[Prague]], the FIS granted roller skiing an official FIS World Championships. On 30 August- 3 September 2000, these competitions took place in the [[Netherlands]].\n \nRaces have a variety of formats with different terrain. Formats include relays, sprints, team races, individual races and pursuit races. Terrain varies from relatively flat to hilly. On flat courses the speed can be as fast as 50 kilometres per hour (30 miles per hour). Average speed on flat tracks in World Cup races can easily be 30 kilometres per hour (20 miles per hour). As in regular cross-country skiing, the skiers compete in classic and freestyle. Helmets and protective eyeglasses in competitions are mandatory.\n\n===World Cup and World Championships===\nLike their cross-country counterparts, the Italian, Russian, Norwegian, Swedish, German and French rollers have been very strong in competitions compared to other nations since the beginning of competitive roller skiing. Note that World Roller Skiing championships are not an officially sanctioned races by FIS or recognized sports governing bodies.\n\n====Men====\nSo far, the World Cup and World Championships, have been dominated by a few skiers. Successful roller skiers include Italian Alfio di Gregorio, who has won the World Games three times and World Cup four times; Russian Igor Glushkov, who has won the World Cup three times; and Frenchman [[Vincent Vittoz]], who won the World Championships in 2002.\n\n====Women====\nMateja Bogatec from Italy has been one of the most successful female rollers since the beginning of the [[International Ski Federation|FIS]] World Cup in 2000.\n\n==Equipment==\n{{OR-section|date=December 2015}}\n{{POV section|date=December 2015}}\n'''Roller skis''' for classic and skate style skiing are used, as well as \"combi\" skis which may be used for either technique. Off-road rollerskis are a variation designed for rougher surface conditions.\n\nClassic style rollerskis usually have wide wheels to improve balance and better simulate classic ski technique. The wheel diameter is often less than 75mm to reduce the overall weight of the rollerskis. A ratchet mechanism is installed in either the front or rear wheel of each classic rollerski to allow uni-directional travel and simulate propulsion from classic ski strides on snow. The non-ratcheted wheel on each classic rollerski is free-rolling.\n\nSkate rollerski wheels are usually {{convert|24|mm}} wide (similar to those used on inline skates) with a wheel diameter of 100mm. 105mm skate rollerski wheels are a less common standard. Pneumatic rollerski wheels are also available but are especially rare and require pneumatic specific rollerskis. Pneumatic roller ski wheels have significantly greater diameter than non-pneumatic rollerski wheels. Both wheels on skate rollerskis are free-rolling.\n\nRollerski shafts may be composed of many different materials depending on the manufacturer and model. Wood was originally used, though this has mostly been replaced by [[aluminum]], [[fiberglass]], [[kevlar]], [[carbon fiber]] or a combination of these materials. The [[wheelbase]] of skate rollerskis is typically around 610mm while classic rollerskis generally have a wheelbase of at least 700mm. The longer shafts of classic rollerskis help provide a better simulation of snow skiing. Many manufacturers sell junior roller skis, with shorter shafts to reduce the overall weight for younger skiers. Longer shafts generally provides straighter tracking and more stability. Rollerskis also feel more balanced when the bindings are properly mounted as close to balance point as possible. The bindings should never be mounted in a place that allows the cross country boot to be attached behind the balance point of the rollerski.\n\nWheels are connected to rollerski shafts using arms that are either integrated into the shaft design or mounted to the shaft using bolts. Most composite rollerski frames made of fiberglass or carbon fiber have aluminum arms mounted with bolts.\n[[File:Roller Ski TrueSki Technology, Rundle Sport.gif|thumb|Dynasports and Rundle Sport use pivoting forks designs on their rollerskis.

Producers were disturbed by his approach to the [[incest]]-laden story, however, and [[Jeffrey Bloom]] ended up with writing and directing duties.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter the sudden death of their father, teenagers Chris and Cathy and 5-year-old twins Cory and Carrie are forced to travel with their mother Corrine to live with her wealthy parents, who disowned her years ago.\n\nCorrine's mother Olivia, a religious fanatic, takes in her daughter and grandchildren on the condition that the children must be sequestered in a locked room, so her dying husband Malcolm will never know of their existence. The children are shut inside one of the mansion's bedrooms, with access only to the attic via a secret stairway. Their grandmother reveals the truth of what caused Corrine to be stricken from her father's will: Corrine's husband was her father's half-brother, making their children the product of [[incest]]. Returning to the children that night, Corinne is forced to show that she has been [[bullwhip]]ped by her mother, as punishment for marrying her uncle and having children. Corrine explains that, because her father does not know about the children, she still has a chance to inherit his fortune when he soon dies.\n\nThe children struggle with their confinement as their mother's visits become infrequent, and clash with their ultra-religious grandmother. Olivia becomes obsessed with the warped belief that Chris and Cathy are lovers, echoing Corrine and her uncle. Finding them sleeping in the same bed, Olivia smashes Cathy's ballerina music box, her father's gift. She discovers the siblings talking while Cathy is bathing, and Chris chases her away, but Olivia ambushes Cathy in the bedroom, locks Chris in the closet, and hacks off Cathy's hair. She starves them for a week, and Chris is forced to feed Cory his own blood.\n\nThe children are often sick, especially Cory and Carrie. Chris and Cathy remove the hinges from their locked door to occasionally sneak out, and discover their mother has been living a life of luxury and dating a young lawyer, Bart Winslow. She visits them, and they confront her for neglecting them, but she storms out. Cory becomes deathly ill, and Olivia and Corrine agree to take him to the hospital, but Corrine returns to inform the children that Cory has died. The children are devastated, but find their pet mouse dead after eating a cookie Cory did not finish. Chris discovers that Cory and the mouse were killed by [[arsenic]] in the sugar on the cookies they are served with breakfast. Believing their grandmother has been poisoning them, the siblings decide to escape.\n\nChris sneaks out to steal money before they flee, and learns their mother will marry Winslow at the mansion the next morning. Chris suggests they sneak out during the wedding in fancy clothes from the attic. When Olivia enters the next day, hoping to catch them in an \"evil\" act, Chris beats her unconscious with a bedpost. Cathy tells Chris they should tell their grandfather the truth; they had once found him sleeping while investigating their mother's absence. They find his room empty with the bed dismantled \u2013 their grandfather has been dead for months. They also find a copy of his will, two months old, with a clause that if it is ever revealed, even after his death, that Corrine had children from her first marriage, she will be disinherited. The children realize that Corrine, not their grandmother, was poisoning them to secure her inheritance.\n\nCrashing the wedding, the children expose their mother to the guests and the groom. Corrine refuses to acknowledge the children as her own, and Cathy and Chris scold her for breaking her promise to free them after her father died. Chris reveals they found the recent will, and Corrine denies their accusations, but Chris reveals the dead mouse as proof. Cathy tries to force her mother to eat an arsenic-coated cookie, chasing her onto a balcony where Corrine falls and is hanged to death by her own veil. The children leave the mansion as their grandmother looks on with scorn. \n\nThe narrator, an older Cathy, explains that the children survived on their own; Chris became a doctor and Cathy resumed dancing, although Carrie was \"never truly healthy\".

Andrews]] herself demanded and, eventually received, script approval when she sold the film rights to producers Thomas Fries and Sy Levin. She turned down five scripts (the violent and graphic screenplay by Wes Craven<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wes Craven FITA Movie Script|url=http://www.completevca.com/bio_exclusive_craven.shtml|website=The Complete V.C Andrews|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> was rejected by the producers, though), before choosing the script by [[Jeffrey Bloom]], who would also direct. Bloom's script was the one that was the closest to the novel, but, as he did not have full control over the matter of the film, the numerous producers and the two studios forcefully made changes to the script; thus stripping from it many plot points and themes of the novel, including the incestuous relationship between the oldest siblings. Bloom said there was a lot of conflict in production, but he could do nothing to talk the producers out of the many drastic changes made in the script.\n\nOriginally, Bloom wanted [[David Shire]] to score the film, but [[Christopher Young]] was chosen by the producers instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.completevca.com/bio_exclusive_bloom.shtml|title=The Complete VCA: Director Jeffrey Bloom Speaks About The FITA Movie|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nVeteran actresses [[Louise Fletcher]] and [[Victoria Tennant]] were cast as the Grandmother and Mother, respectively, while the four children were played by newcomers [[Kristy Swanson]], [[Jeb Stuart Adams]], Ben Ryan Ganger, and [[Lindsay Parker]], respectively. Swanson once stated that when V.C. Andrews met her, she said Swanson was just like she pictured Cathy.\n\nBeing a fairly low-budget production, Bloom said, big names were not considered for any role in the film. Jeffrey Bloom had a young [[Sharon Stone]] audition for the film, but he could not convince the producers to give her the part of Corrine, the mother.\n\n===Filming===\nLouise Fletcher wanted to get deep inside her role, so she called Andrews one night to ask about the motivation of her character in the film. She was also so into the part, that she stayed strictly within the character of the Grandmother all the time, even when she was not shooting. \"I couldn't let myself think about distractions like what a beautiful day or what are we going to have for lunch?\" she said in an interview.\n\nAndrews was given a cameo as a maid in Foxworth Hall, scrubbing the glass of a window after Chris and Cathy attempt to escape from the rooftop. Anne Patty, present at the filming of Andrews' scene, said that her part is [[metaphor]]ical. \"The writer is a person who wipes the window clean so that the reader can clearly see into the lives of the characters.\"\n\nBloom stated that, after filming was completed, the producers approached him to refilm a new ending, and one of the many ideas was that the siblings accidentally kill Corinne during their escape. Bloom tried to talk them out of it and when he was unable to convince them otherwise, he eventually quit. The new ending, partly inspired by the ending of Wes Craven's own screenplay, was eventually filmed by someone else.\n\n[[Castle Hill (Ipswich, Massachusetts)|Castle Hill]], a [[Tudor Revival]] mansion in [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]], served as Foxworth Hall and was the main location at which nearly all interior and exterior scenes were filmed. The beginning scene shows the children walking towards the front of the house after being dropped off by the bus. In reality the bus stop is at the end of the rolling green where the lawn ends and the ocean begins. The final scene of the film, where Cathy pushes her mother Corrine off of the balcony and her bridal veil gets caught in the trellis, strangling her to death, was filmed at [[Greystone Mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]].\n\n===Post-production===\nJeffrey Bloom had no involvement in the final edit of the film, as he had walked off the set, and the new ending was inserted. He also stated, regarding scenes involving incest between Chris and Cathy, scenes were indeed cut.\n\nBloom's original early cut of the movie was screened to a test audience in December 1986 in San Fernando Valley, and it was met with negative reactions, mostly because of the scenes of incest between Cathy and Chris. The test audience, mostly consisting of female adolescents (the same demographic the book series was targeted towards), reported in test cards that they were revolted by the scenes and another where Corrine disrobes in front of her father to be whipped by her mother. They also disliked the original ending, where Louise Fletcher's character tries to kill the children with a butcher knife, because they found it to be \"too horrific.\"\n\nThe producers insisted on a new ending because they thought that the audience for the film would want to see the children take revenge on Corrine, so an unknown director was brought in to film the new ending where Corrine dies (despite the fact that her character lives in the first three books in the series). While most of the movie was filmed in Massachusetts, the new ending was filmed in California. The film was severely re-cut. This was done not just to remove \"sensitive content\" but also to make it shorter to secure more theatrical screenings, as well as the addition of the infamous new ending that writer and director Jeffrey Bloom hated and refused to film. The film was then again screened to a test audience in January 1987. This version was met with more positive feedback and was the version that was released in theaters. Due to drastic re-editing, the film was pushed back to November from its original release in March, almost an entire year later than Bloom's original cut was completed and test screened.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-15/entertainment/ca-20643_1_meat-cleaver|title=No Rose Garden|first=Sheldon|last=Teitelbaum|date=15 November 1987|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\nOne of the scenes deleted from the final cut of the film was shown in a TV program covering the behind-the-scenes production of the film. It is an extended scene from when Chris and Cathy enter Corrine's bedroom. It shows Cathy going about the room wondering why there are no pictures of Corrine's children or her husband in the room. Another deleted scene was shown being filmed where Corrine and the grandmother confront each other after Cory's death and the grandmother is shown smiling, indicating that she was involved in Cory's funeral.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8s-P9Cy6DQ|title=V.C. Andrews Last Interview?|first=|last=amy butchas|date=21 August 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Bloom in a 2010 interview, nudity and scenes of incest were not cut out solely because of negative feedback from test audiences, but also because the studio and the producers wanted to secure a lower rating. Even the \"small shots and small suggestive stuff\" were cut out to make sure that the film received a PG-13 rating from the MPAA.<ref>http://natsukashi.wordpress.com/2010/01/08/flowers-in-the-attic-with-director-jeffrey-bloom/ (13:55)</ref>\n\nKristy Swanson stated in a 2014 interview that there was a test screening which had all scenes of incest included, but after the audience found them to be uncomfortable, they were cut out. Producer Sy Levin also mentioned that one of the cut scenes had Chris watching Cathy through the crack of the door while she was taking off her clothes and getting into a bathtub. Also, test screenings of the film in San Jose and Ohio, after re-editing, were said to include another alternate ending, but no further details were reported. According to a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' interview (at the time when the movie was released in theaters) with actor Alex Koba who played butler John Hall, just like in Andrews' novel, his character had a much bigger role in the original script and also provided a key surprise plot twist. After several rewrites, his character was severely reduced and had only one line of dialogue in the entire film (\"Good evening, Mr. Winthrop\"), and the butler had become little more than a gloomy figure in black who wheels a serving cart back and forth across the screen; as a result, the plot twist was gone. Koba also said about different versions of the endings for the movie: \"They had three different endings for that movie, and they picked the worst one, the one you're seeing now.\" In another, earlier article it was also mentioned that Bloom's original intended ending was very similar to the ending of the original book, and it included the children simply walking out of their attic prison into the sunshine during the wedding, to symbolize growing up, Bloom said, with \"the way to freedom clear.\" It is not known whether this version of the ending was included only in Bloom's original script, or whether it actually was filmed and is the second alternate ending that was shown in some test screenings. Despite interest from fans, no uncut version of the film was released, nor was Bloom's original director's cut, and it is not known if the deleted footage still exists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/631039-exclusive-interview-kristy-swanson-revisits-flowers-in-the-attic|title=Exclusive Interview: Kristy Swanson Revisits Flowers in the Attic|date=16 January 2014|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-02/entertainment/ca-17371_1_big-screen|title=Actor's Big Screen 'Splash' Evaporates in Cutting Room|first=JAN|last=HERMAN|date=2 December 1987|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Bloom, the original ending consisted of:\n\n<blockquote>Briefly, the surviving children interrupt the wedding ceremony and dramatically confront Corrine. All in attendance are horrified by what the children say about how their mother locked them up and poisoned them. The groom is shocked speechless. The grandmother is outraged. The grandfather is there, in his wheelchair, to hear it all. Corrine denies everything, but it doesn't matter; it's too late. The children's story is bolstered by the fact that they look half dead. They leave the wedding, but before leaving the house the grandmother tries to attack them [with a big knife]. They're saved by John Hall, the butler. The grandmother is subdued by him and the children leave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.completevca.com/bio_exclusive_bloom.shtml#altending|title=The Complete VCA: Director Jeffrey Bloom Speaks About The FITA Movie|publisher=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received mostly negative reviews from critics and fans of the book, who both disliked the film's slow pacing, acting and plot changes. It currently holds a rating of 13% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 8 reviews.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flowers_in_the_attic/| title=Flowers in the Attivc (1987)| publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] commented that, \"V.C.

I remember running into [[Louise Fletcher]] in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] about four years ago. She asked me if I had gotten the ''Petals on the Wind'' script, which I had, and she wanted to know if I had read it. I told her I had and that they had called me about it. I was interested but then I didn't hear from them anymore. And apparently the same thing happened with her. It's like they wanted to do it but they couldn't get it off the ground ... When I read the script, I wasn't too thrilled with it. I know Cathy goes through a lot in the next book, and the script was a real \"sexfest.\" She gets pregnant and has so many affairs. There's her brother, Christopher, and then she has an affair with Julian, the dancer, and there's Paul, the doctor. I was actually kind of wondering if I should even do a sequel, you know?

Producers were disturbed by his approach to the [[incest]]-laden story, however, and [[Jeffrey Bloom]] ended up with writing and directing duties.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter the sudden death of their father, teenagers Chris and Cathy and 5-year-old twins Cory and Carrie are forced to travel with their mother Corrine to live with her wealthy parents, who disowned her years ago.\n\nCorrine's mother Olivia, a religious fanatic, takes in her daughter and grandchildren on the condition that the children must be sequestered in a locked room, so her dying husband Malcolm will never know of their existence. The children are shut inside one of the mansion\u2019s bedrooms, with access only to the attic via a secret stairway. Their grandmother reveals the truth of what caused Corrine to be stricken from her father's will: Corrine's husband was her father's half-brother, making their children the product of [[incest]]. Returning to the children that night, Corinne is forced to show that she has been [[bullwhip]]ped by her mother, as punishment for marrying her uncle and having children. Corrine explains that, because her father does not know about the children, she still has a chance to inherit his fortune when he soon dies.\n\nThe children struggle with their confinement as their mother\u2019s visits become infrequent, and clash with their ultra-religious grandmother. Olivia becomes obsessed with the warped belief that Chris and Cathy are lovers, echoing Corrine and her uncle. Finding them sleeping in the same bed, Olivia smashes Cathy's ballerina music box, her father\u2019s gift. She discovers the siblings talking while Cathy is bathing, and Chris chases her away, but Olivia ambushes Cathy in the bedroom, locks Chris in the closet, and hacks off Cathy's hair. She starves them for a week, and Chris is forced to feed Cory his own blood.\n\nThe children are often sick, especially Cory and Carrie. Chris and Cathy remove the hinges from their locked door to occasionally sneak out, and discover their mother has been living a life of luxury and dating a young lawyer, Bart Winslow. She visits them, and they confront her for neglecting them, but she storms out. Cory becomes deathly ill, and Olivia and Corrine agree to take him to the hospital, but Corrine returns to inform the children that Cory has died. The children are devastated, but find their pet mouse dead after eating a cookie Cory did not finish. Chris discovers that Cory and the mouse were killed by [[arsenic]] in the sugar on the cookies they are served with breakfast. Believing their grandmother has been poisoning them, the siblings decide to escape.\n\nChris sneaks out to steal money before they flee, and learns their mother will marry Winslow at the mansion the next morning. Chris suggests they sneak out during the wedding in fancy clothes from the attic. When Olivia enters the next day, hoping to catch them in an \"evil\" act, Chris beats her unconscious with a bedpost. Cathy tells Chris they should tell their grandfather the truth; they had once found him sleeping while investigating their mother's absence. They find his room empty with the bed dismantled \u2013 their grandfather has been dead for months. They also find a copy of his will, two months old, with a clause that if it is ever revealed, even after his death, that Corrine had children from her first marriage, she will be disinherited. The children realize that Corrine, not their grandmother, was poisoning them to secure her inheritance.\n\nCrashing the wedding, the children expose their mother to the guests and the groom. Corrine refuses to acknowledge the children as her own, and Cathy and Chris scold her for breaking her promise to free them after her father died. Chris reveals they found the recent will, and Corrine denies their accusations, but Chris reveals the dead mouse as proof. Cathy tries to force her mother to eat an arsenic-coated cookie, chasing her onto a balcony where Corrine falls and is hanged to death by her own veil. The children leave the mansion as their grandmother looks on with scorn. \n\nThe narrator, an older Cathy, explains that the children survived on their own; Chris became a doctor and Cathy resumed dancing, although Carrie was \"never truly healthy\". She wonders if her grandmother is still alive, anticipating Cathy's eventual return to claim the family fortune.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kristy Swanson]] as 15\u201318-year-old Cathy Dollanganger\n* [[Jeb Stuart Adams]] as 17\u201320-year-old Chris Dollanganger\n* [[Victoria Tennant]] as Corrine Dollanganger (Mother)\n* [[Louise Fletcher]] as Olivia Foxworth (Grandmother)\n* Ben Ryan Ganger as 5\u20137-year-old Cory Dollanganger\n* [[Lindsay Parker]] as 5\u20137-year-old Carrie Dollanganger\n* [[Marshall Colt]] as Christopher Dollanganger (Father)\n* [[Nathan Davis (actor)|Nathan Davis]] as Malcolm Foxworth (Grandfather)\n* Brooke Fries as Flower Girl\n* Alex Koba as John Hall, the butler\n* [[Leonard Mann (actor)|Leonard Mann]] as Bart Winslow\n* Bruce Neckels as Minister\n* Gus Peters as Caretaker\n* Clare Peck as Cathy (narrator)\n* [[V.

Andrews]] herself demanded and, eventually received, script approval when she sold the film rights to producers Thomas Fries and Sy Levin. She turned down five scripts (the violent and graphic screenplay by Wes Craven<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wes Craven FITA Movie Script|url=http://www.completevca.com/bio_exclusive_craven.shtml|website=The Complete V.C Andrews|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> was rejected by the producers, though), before choosing the script by [[Jeffrey Bloom]], who would also direct. Bloom's script was the one that was the closest to the novel, but, as he did not have full control over the matter of the film, the numerous producers and the two studios forcefully made changes to the script; thus stripping from it many plot points and themes of the novel, including the incestuous relationship between the oldest siblings. Bloom said there was a lot of conflict in production, but he could do nothing to talk the producers out of the many drastic changes made in the script.\n\nOriginally, Bloom wanted [[David Shire]] to score the film, but [[Christopher Young]] was chosen by the producers instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.completevca.com/bio_exclusive_bloom.shtml|title=The Complete VCA: Director Jeffrey Bloom Speaks About The FITA Movie|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nVeteran actresses [[Louise Fletcher]] and [[Victoria Tennant]] were cast as the Grandmother and Mother, respectively, while the four children were played by newcomers [[Kristy Swanson]], [[Jeb Stuart Adams]], Ben Ryan Ganger, and [[Lindsay Parker]], respectively. Swanson once stated that when V.C. Andrews met her, she said Swanson was just like she pictured Cathy.\n\nBeing a fairly low-budget production, Bloom said, big names were not considered for any role in the film. Jeffrey Bloom had a young [[Sharon Stone]] audition for the film, but he could not convince the producers to give her the part of Corrine, the mother.\n\n===Filming===\nLouise Fletcher wanted to get deep inside her role, so she called Andrews one night to ask about the motivation of her character in the film. She was also so into the part, that she stayed strictly within the character of the Grandmother all the time, even when she was not shooting. \"I couldn't let myself think about distractions like what a beautiful day or what are we going to have for lunch?\" she said in an interview.\n\nAndrews was given a cameo as a maid in Foxworth Hall, scrubbing the glass of a window after Chris and Cathy attempt to escape from the rooftop. Anne Patty, present at the filming of Andrews' scene, said that her part is [[metaphor]]ical. \"The writer is a person who wipes the window clean so that the reader can clearly see into the lives of the characters.\"\n\nBloom stated that, after filming was completed, the producers approached him to refilm a new ending, and one of the many ideas was that the siblings accidentally kill Corinne during their escape. Bloom tried to talk them out of it and when he was unable to convince them otherwise, he eventually quit. The new ending, partly inspired by the ending of Wes Craven's own screenplay, was eventually filmed by someone else.\n\n[[Castle Hill (Ipswich, Massachusetts)|Castle Hill]], a [[Tudor Revival]] mansion in [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]], served as Foxworth Hall and was the main location at which nearly all interior and exterior scenes were filmed. The beginning scene shows the children walking towards the front of the house after being dropped off by the bus. In reality the bus stop is at the end of the rolling green where the lawn ends and the ocean begins. The final scene of the film, where Cathy pushes her mother Corrine off of the balcony and her bridal veil gets caught in the trellis, strangling her to death, was filmed at [[Greystone Mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]].\n\n===Post-production===\nJeffrey Bloom had no involvement in the final edit of the film, as he had walked off the set, and the new ending was inserted. He also stated, regarding scenes involving incest between Chris and Cathy, scenes were indeed cut.\n\nBloom's original early cut of the movie was screened to a test audience in December 1986 in San Fernando Valley, and it was met with negative reactions, mostly because of the scenes of incest between Cathy and Chris. The test audience, mostly consisting of female adolescents (the same demographic the book series was targeted towards), reported in test cards that they were revolted by the scenes and another where Corrine disrobes in front of her father to be whipped by her mother. They also disliked the original ending, where Louise Fletcher's character tries to kill the children with a butcher knife, because they found it to be \"too horrific.\"\n\nThe producers insisted on a new ending because they thought that the audience for the film would want to see the children take revenge on Corrine, so an unknown director was brought in to film the new ending where Corrine dies (despite the fact that her character lives in the first three books in the series). While most of the movie was filmed in Massachusetts, the new ending was filmed in California. The film was severely re-cut. This was done not just to remove \"sensitive content\" but also to make it shorter to secure more theatrical screenings, as well as the addition of the infamous new ending that writer and director Jeffrey Bloom hated and refused to film. The film was then again screened to a test audience in January 1987. This version was met with more positive feedback and was the version that was released in theaters. Due to drastic re-editing, the film was pushed back to November from its original release in March, almost an entire year later than Bloom's original cut was completed and test screened.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-15/entertainment/ca-20643_1_meat-cleaver|title=No Rose Garden|first=Sheldon|last=Teitelbaum|date=15 November 1987|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\nOne of the scenes deleted from the final cut of the film was shown in a TV program covering the behind-the-scenes production of the film. It is an extended scene from when Chris and Cathy enter Corrine's bedroom. It shows Cathy going about the room wondering why there are no pictures of Corrine's children or her husband in the room. Another deleted scene was shown being filmed where Corrine and the grandmother confront each other after Cory's death and the grandmother is shown smiling, indicating that she was involved in Cory's funeral.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8s-P9Cy6DQ|title=V.C. Andrews Last Interview?|first=|last=amy butchas|date=21 August 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Bloom in a 2010 interview, nudity and scenes of incest were not cut out solely because of negative feedback from test audiences, but also because the studio and the producers wanted to secure a lower rating. Even the \"small shots and small suggestive stuff\" were cut out to make sure that the film received a PG-13 rating from the MPAA.<ref>http://natsukashi.wordpress.com/2010/01/08/flowers-in-the-attic-with-director-jeffrey-bloom/ (13:55)</ref>\n\nKristy Swanson stated in a 2014 interview that there was a test screening which had all scenes of incest included, but after the audience found them to be uncomfortable, they were cut out. Producer Sy Levin also mentioned that one of the cut scenes had Chris watching Cathy through the crack of the door while she was taking off her clothes and getting into a bathtub. Also, test screenings of the film in San Jose and Ohio, after re-editing, were said to include another alternate ending, but no further details were reported. According to a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' interview (at the time when the movie was released in theaters) with actor Alex Koba who played butler John Hall, just like in Andrews' novel, his character had a much bigger role in the original script and also provided a key surprise plot twist. After several rewrites, his character was severely reduced and had only one line of dialogue in the entire film (\"Good evening, Mr. Winthrop\"), and the butler had become little more than a gloomy figure in black who wheels a serving cart back and forth across the screen; as a result, the plot twist was gone. Koba also said about different versions of the endings for the movie: \"They had three different endings for that movie, and they picked the worst one, the one you're seeing now.\" In another, earlier article it was also mentioned that Bloom's original intended ending was very similar to the ending of the original book, and it included the children simply walking out of their attic prison into the sunshine during the wedding, to symbolize growing up, Bloom said, with \"the way to freedom clear.\" It is not known whether this version of the ending was included only in Bloom's original script, or whether it actually was filmed and is the second alternate ending that was shown in some test screenings. Despite interest from fans, no uncut version of the film was released, nor was Bloom's original director's cut, and it is not known if the deleted footage still exists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/631039-exclusive-interview-kristy-swanson-revisits-flowers-in-the-attic|title=Exclusive Interview: Kristy Swanson Revisits Flowers in the Attic|date=16 January 2014|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-02/entertainment/ca-17371_1_big-screen|title=Actor's Big Screen 'Splash' Evaporates in Cutting Room|first=JAN|last=HERMAN|date=2 December 1987|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Bloom, the original ending consisted of:\n\n<blockquote>Briefly, the surviving children interrupt the wedding ceremony and dramatically confront Corrine. All in attendance are horrified by what the children say about how their mother locked them up and poisoned them. The groom is shocked speechless. The grandmother is outraged. The grandfather is there, in his wheelchair, to hear it all. Corrine denies everything, but it doesn't matter; it's too late. The children's story is bolstered by the fact that they look half dead. They leave the wedding, but before leaving the house the grandmother tries to attack them [with a big knife]. They're saved by John Hall, the butler. The grandmother is subdued by him and the children leave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.completevca.com/bio_exclusive_bloom.shtml#altending|title=The Complete VCA: Director Jeffrey Bloom Speaks About The FITA Movie|publisher=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received mostly negative reviews from critics and fans of the book, who both disliked the film's slow pacing, acting and plot changes. It currently holds a rating of 13% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 8 reviews.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flowers_in_the_attic/| title=Flowers in the Attivc (1987)| publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] commented that, \"V.C.

I remember running into [[Louise Fletcher]] in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] about four years ago. She asked me if I had gotten the ''Petals on the Wind'' script, which I had, and she wanted to know if I had read it. I told her I had and that they had called me about it. I was interested but then I didn't hear from them anymore. And apparently the same thing happened with her. It's like they wanted to do it but they couldn't get it off the ground ... When I read the script, I wasn't too thrilled with it. I know Cathy goes through a lot in the next book, and the script was a real \"sexfest.\" She gets pregnant and has so many affairs. There's her brother, Christopher, and then she has an affair with Julian, the dancer, and there's Paul, the doctor. I was actually kind of wondering if I should even do a sequel, you know?

The tale has been adapted to various media including opera, musical, and animated film. The tale is completely Andersen's invention and owes no debt to fairy tales or folklore.\n\n==Plot==\n\nWhen the story begins, a mother duck's eggs hatch. One of the little birds is perceived by the other birds and animals on the farm as an ugly little creature and suffers much verbal and physical abuse from them. He wanders sadly from the barnyard and lives with wild ducks and geese until hunters slaughter the flocks. He finds a home with an old woman, but her cat and hen tease and taunt him mercilessly and once again he sets off alone.\n\nThe duckling sees a flock of migrating wild swans. He is delighted and excited, but he cannot join them, for he is too young and cannot fly. Winter arrives. A farmer finds and carries the freezing little duckling home, but the foundling is frightened by the farmer\u2019s noisy children and flees the house. He spends a miserable winter alone in the outdoors, mostly hiding in a cave on the lake that partly freezes over. When spring arrives, a flock of swans descends on the lake.\n\nThe ugly duckling, now having fully grown and matured, is unable to endure a life of solitude and hardship any more and decides to throw himself at the flock of swans deciding that it is better to be killed by such beautiful birds than to live a life of ugliness and misery. He is shocked when the swans welcome and accept him, only to realize by looking at his reflection in the water that he had been, not a duckling, but a swan all this time. The flock takes to the air, and the now beautiful swan spreads his gorgeous large wings and takes flight with the rest of his new family.\n\n==Composition and publication history==\nAndersen first conceived the story in 1842 while enjoying the beauty of nature during his stay at the country estate of Bregentved, and lavished a year's worth of attention upon it. He initially considered \"The Young Swans\" as the tale's title but, not wanting to spoil the element of surprise in the protagonist\u2019s transformation, discarded it for \"The Ugly Duckling\". He later confessed that the story was \"a reflection of my own life\", and, when the critic Georg Brandes questioned Andersen about whether he would write his autobiography, the poet claimed that it had already been written \u2014 \"The Ugly Duckling\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Elias |last=Bredsdorff |title=Hans Christian Andersen: The Story of his Life and Work 1805-75 |publisher=Phaidon |year=1975 |isbn=0-7148-1636-1}}</ref>\n\n\u201cThe Ugly Duckling\u201d was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark 11 November 1843 in ''[[New Fairy Tales (1844)|New Fairy Tales.

For the first time the phrase \"told for children\" was not part of the title&mdash;an omission Andersen scholar Jackie Wullschlager believes exhibited a new confidence on Andersen's part: \"These [tales] were the most mature and perfectly constructed tales he had written, and though some of them at once became, and have remained, favorites of children, Andersen here melds together the childlike and the profound with exceptional artistry.\" The first edition of 850 was sold out by December 18, and Reitzel planned another 850.<ref name=\"Wullschlager\">{{cite book |last=Wullschlager |first=Jackie |title=Hans Christian Andersen: The Life of a Storyteller |url=https://archive.org/details/hanschristianand0000wull |url-access=registration |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2002}}</ref>\n\nThe tale was fourth and last in the volume that included (in contents order), \"[[The Angel (fairy tale)|The Angel]]\" (\"Englen\"), \"[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]\" (\"Nattergalen\"), and \"[[The Sweethearts; or, The Top and the Ball]]\" (\"Kj\u00e6restefolkene [Toppen og bolden]\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/rundtom/faq/index_e.html?emne=bogudg |publisher=Hans Christian Andersen Center |title=Hans Christian Andersen - FAQ: Books by Hans Christian Andersen}}</ref> The volume sold out almost immediately and Andersen wrote on December 18, 1843: \u201cThe book is selling like hot cakes.

Things are simply fated and unfold accordingly, whether or not the hero takes some action.\u201d In conjunction with Bettelheim\u2019s assessment, [[Maria Tatar]] notes  in \u2019\u2019The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen\u2019\u2019 that Andersen suggests that the Ugly Duckling's superiority resides in the fact that he is of a breed different from the barnyard rabble, and that dignity and worth, moral and aesthetic superiority are determined by nature rather than accomplishment.<ref name=\"Tatar\" />\n\nAccording to Carole Rosen, the story was inspired in part by Andersen's friend [[Jenny Lind]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rosen |first=Carole |editor1-last=Matthew |editor1-first=H.

The tale was adapted to a variety of media. Films based on the tale include two ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' animated shorts produced by Walt Disney called ''[[The Ugly Duckling (1939 film)|The Ugly Duckling]]''. The first was produced in 1931 in black and white, and a remake in 1939 in [[Technicolor]]. The latter film won the 1939 [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intanibase.com/shorts.aspx?shortID=288&studioID=1 |title=The 1939 Silly Symphony |publisher=The Internet Animation Database}}</ref> and was the last Silly Symphony to be made. The main difference between the Andersen story and the Disney version is that, in the latter, the little bird's ordeal lasts for only a few minutes, not for months. In 1936, the Fleischer brothers adapted the story for their animated short \"The Little Stranger\", reversing the story by having an odd chick born into a family of ducks. In 1956 the Soviet animation studio [[Soyuzmultfilm]] produced its own 19 minutes version of The Ugly Duckling.<ref>''[http://www.animator.ru/db/?ver=eng&p=show_film&fid=3072 The Ugly Duckling]'' at [[Animator.ru]]</ref> The anime ''[[Princess Tutu]]'' is about a duck that turns into a swan-like ballerina. In 2006, the Danish animation studio [[A. Film]] produced a spin-off CG feature called ''[[The Ugly Duckling and Me!]]'', and later produced a children's CG television series ''Ugly Duckling Junior'' which featured the same characters as the movie. The 1954 [[Tom and Jerry]] cartoon ''[[Downhearted Duckling]]'' is also based on the famous story.\n\nThe tale has seen various musical adaptations. In 1914, the Russian composer [[Sergei Prokofiev]] composed a work for voice and piano based on Nina Meshcherskaya's adaptation of the tale and, in 1932, arranged the work for voice and orchestra. This was transcribed by Lev Konov in 1996, and his opera was a great success in Russia. Other musical versions include the song \u201cThe Ugly Duckling\u201d composed by [[Frank Loesser]] and sung by [[Danny Kaye]] for the 1952 [[Charles Vidor]] [[musical film]] ''[[Hans Christian Andersen (film)|Hans Christian Andersen]]'', and  ''[[Honk!]]'', a musical based on the tale which was produced in Britain and won an [[Olivier Award]]. The tale was adapted to a musical by Gail Deschamps and Paul Hamilton with a planned United States tour 2002-2003. In 1998, the musical played the Piccolo Spoleto for seventeen days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmtproductions.com/p-duckling.htm |title=GMT: The Ugly Duckling}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Jerry Pinkney]] [[The Ugly Duckling (Pinkney book)|adapted the story]] as a children's picture book.<ref>{{cite book |title=The ugly duckling |publisher=Online Computer Library Center |oclc = 39051276}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the [[Dance Theatre]] of [[Bradenton, Florida]], presented the ballet version of the popular tale (Allison Norton: The Ugly Duckling).\n\nIn 2010, [[Garri Bardin]] directed a feature-length [[stop-motion]] [[musical film|musical]] of the story set to [[Music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky#Ballets|Tchaikovsky's ballet music]].\n\nIn 2012, a musical adaptation of the story, with ten original songs, was released by JJ\u2019s Tunes & Tales.  The album, titled \u201cThe Ugly Duckling: Story with Songs\u201d contains both songs and spoken narration, and was released independently on [[CD Baby]] and [[iTunes]].  Examples of song titles include:  Hatching of the Eggs; A Better Place; Song of the Swans; What\u2019s the Matter with You; It\u2019s a Big, Big World; Pretty Good Place to Live.\n\n''GivingTales'' \u2013 in 2015 a storytelling app for children was created in aid of Unicef.

A farmer finds and carries the freezing little duckling home, but the foundling is frightened by the farmer\u2019s noisy children and flees the house. He spends a miserable winter alone in the outdoors, mostly hiding in a cave on the lake that partly freezes over. When spring arrives, a flock of swans descends on the lake.\n\nThe ugly duckling, now having fully grown and matured, is unable to endure a life of solitude and hardship any more and decides to throw himself at the flock of swans deciding that it is better to be killed by such beautiful birds than to live a life of ugliness and misery. He is shocked when the swans welcome and accept him, only to realize by looking at his reflection in the water that he had been, not a duckling, but a swan all this time. The flock takes to the air, and the now beautiful swan spreads his gorgeous large wings and takes flight with the rest of his new family.\n\n==Composition and publication history==\nAndersen first conceived the story in 1842 while enjoying the beauty of nature during his stay at the country estate of Bregentved, and lavished a year's worth of attention upon it. He initially considered \"The Young Swans\" as the tale's title but, not wanting to spoil the element of surprise in the protagonist\u2019s transformation, discarded it for \"The Ugly Duckling\". He later confessed that the story was \"a reflection of my own life\", and, when the critic Georg Brandes questioned Andersen about whether he would write his autobiography, the poet claimed that it had already been written \u2014 \"The Ugly Duckling\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Elias |last=Bredsdorff |title=Hans Christian Andersen: The Story of his Life and Work 1805-75 |publisher=Phaidon |year=1975 |isbn=0-7148-1636-1}}</ref>\n\n\u201cThe Ugly Duckling\u201d was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark 11 November 1843 in ''[[New Fairy Tales (1844)|New Fairy Tales. First Book. First Collection. 1844. (Nye Eventyr. F\u00f8rste Bind. F\u00f8rste Samling. 1844.)]]''. For the first time the phrase \"told for children\" was not part of the title&mdash;an omission Andersen scholar Jackie Wullschlager believes exhibited a new confidence on Andersen's part: \"These [tales] were the most mature and perfectly constructed tales he had written, and though some of them at once became, and have remained, favorites of children, Andersen here melds together the childlike and the profound with exceptional artistry.\" The first edition of 850 was sold out by December 18, and Reitzel planned another 850.<ref name=\"Wullschlager\">{{cite book |last=Wullschlager |first=Jackie |title=Hans Christian Andersen: The Life of a Storyteller |url=https://archive.org/details/hanschristianand0000wull |url-access=registration |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2002}}</ref>\n\nThe tale was fourth and last in the volume that included (in contents order), \"[[The Angel (fairy tale)|The Angel]]\" (\"Englen\"), \"[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]\" (\"Nattergalen\"), and \"[[The Sweethearts; or, The Top and the Ball]]\" (\"Kj\u00e6restefolkene [Toppen og bolden]\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/rundtom/faq/index_e.html?emne=bogudg |publisher=Hans Christian Andersen Center |title=Hans Christian Andersen - FAQ: Books by Hans Christian Andersen}}</ref> The volume sold out almost immediately and Andersen wrote on December 18, 1843: \u201cThe book is selling like hot cakes.

The ugly duckling is the child of a swan whose egg accidentally rolled into a duck's nest.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/06/05/boand05.xml |title=The tale of an ugly duckling |first=Anne |last=Chisholm |date=2006-06-05 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n\nSpeculation suggests that Andersen was the illegitimate son of Prince Christian Frederik (later King [[Christian VIII of Denmark]]), and found this out some time before he wrote the book, and then that being a swan in the story was a metaphor not just for inner beauty and talent but also for secret royal lineage.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article409116.ece |title=The Little Prince |first=Neil |last=Philip |date=2005-01-08 |newspaper=[[The Times]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Bruno Bettelheim]] observes in ''[[The Uses of Enchantment]]'' that the Ugly Duckling is not confronted with the tasks, tests, or trials of the typical fairy tale hero. \u201cNo need to accomplish anything is expressed in \u201cThe Ugly Duckling\u201d. Things are simply fated and unfold accordingly, whether or not the hero takes some action.\u201d In conjunction with Bettelheim\u2019s assessment, [[Maria Tatar]] notes  in \u2019\u2019The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen\u2019\u2019 that Andersen suggests that the Ugly Duckling's superiority resides in the fact that he is of a breed different from the barnyard rabble, and that dignity and worth, moral and aesthetic superiority are determined by nature rather than accomplishment.<ref name=\"Tatar\" />\n\nAccording to Carole Rosen, the story was inspired in part by Andersen's friend [[Jenny Lind]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rosen |first=Carole |editor1-last=Matthew |editor1-first=H.

The tale was adapted to a variety of media. Films based on the tale include two ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' animated shorts produced by Walt Disney called ''[[The Ugly Duckling (1939 film)|The Ugly Duckling]]''. The first was produced in 1931 in black and white, and a remake in 1939 in [[Technicolor]]. The latter film won the 1939 [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intanibase.com/shorts.aspx?shortID=288&studioID=1 |title=The 1939 Silly Symphony |publisher=The Internet Animation Database}}</ref> and was the last Silly Symphony to be made. The main difference between the Andersen story and the Disney version is that, in the latter, the little bird's ordeal lasts for only a few minutes, not for months. In 1936, the Fleischer brothers adapted the story for their animated short \"The Little Stranger\", reversing the story by having an odd chick born into a family of ducks. In 1956 the Soviet animation studio [[Soyuzmultfilm]] produced its own 19 minutes version of The Ugly Duckling.<ref>''[http://www.animator.ru/db/?ver=eng&p=show_film&fid=3072 The Ugly Duckling]'' at [[Animator.ru]]</ref> The anime ''[[Princess Tutu]]'' is about a duck that turns into a swan-like ballerina. In 2006, the Danish animation studio [[A. Film]] produced a spin-off CG feature called ''[[The Ugly Duckling and Me!]]'', and later produced a children's CG television series ''Ugly Duckling Junior'' which featured the same characters as the movie. The 1954 [[Tom and Jerry]] cartoon ''[[Downhearted Duckling]]'' is also based on the famous story.\n\nThe tale has seen various musical adaptations. In 1914, the Russian composer [[Sergei Prokofiev]] composed a work for voice and piano based on Nina Meshcherskaya's adaptation of the tale and, in 1932, arranged the work for voice and orchestra. This was transcribed by Lev Konov in 1996, and his opera was a great success in Russia. Other musical versions include the song \u201cThe Ugly Duckling\u201d composed by [[Frank Loesser]] and sung by [[Danny Kaye]] for the 1952 [[Charles Vidor]] [[musical film]] ''[[Hans Christian Andersen (film)|Hans Christian Andersen]]'', and  ''[[Honk!]]'', a musical based on the tale which was produced in Britain and won an [[Olivier Award]]. The tale was adapted to a musical by Gail Deschamps and Paul Hamilton with a planned United States tour 2002-2003. In 1998, the musical played the Piccolo Spoleto for seventeen days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmtproductions.com/p-duckling.htm |title=GMT: The Ugly Duckling}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Jerry Pinkney]] [[The Ugly Duckling (Pinkney book)|adapted the story]] as a children's picture book.<ref>{{cite book |title=The ugly duckling |publisher=Online Computer Library Center |oclc = 39051276}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the [[Dance Theatre]] of [[Bradenton, Florida]], presented the ballet version of the popular tale (Allison Norton: The Ugly Duckling).\n\nIn 2010, [[Garri Bardin]] directed a feature-length [[stop-motion]] [[musical film|musical]] of the story set to [[Music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky#Ballets|Tchaikovsky's ballet music]].\n\nIn 2012, a musical adaptation of the story, with ten original songs, was released by JJ\u2019s Tunes & Tales.  The album, titled \u201cThe Ugly Duckling: Story with Songs\u201d contains both songs and spoken narration, and was released independently on [[CD Baby]] and [[iTunes]].  Examples of song titles include:  Hatching of the Eggs; A Better Place; Song of the Swans; What\u2019s the Matter with You; It\u2019s a Big, Big World; Pretty Good Place to Live.\n\n''GivingTales'' \u2013 in 2015 a storytelling app for children was created in aid of Unicef.

G\u00e9rard visits them with a present from Dargelos of an exotic poison, a subject that had fascinated the two at school. \n\nHaving lost Agathe and now a virtual prisoner of \u00c9lisabeth, Paul in despair takes the poison. When Agathe visits him on his deathbed, they discover how \u00c9lisabeth has destroyed their love. \u00c9lisabeth realises that Paul's death would end the game with him winning. Subsequently, to ruin their reconciliation and to avoid being on her own, \u00c9lisabeth openly shoots herself and dies seconds before Paul.
