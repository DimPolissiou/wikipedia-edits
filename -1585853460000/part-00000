Leader [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was, above all, a revolutionary movement.\n\nSurrealism developed out of the [[Dada]] activities during [[World War I]]. The most important center of the movement was [[Paris]], France. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, impacting the visual arts, literature, film, and [[Surrealist music|music]] of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social theory.\n\n==Founding of the movement==\nThe word 'surrealism' was first coined in March 1917 by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].<ref>Hargrove, Nancy (1998). \"The Great Parade: Cocteau, Picasso, Satie, Massine, Diaghilev\u2014and T.S. Eliot\". Journal for the Interdisciplinary Study of Literature 31 (1)</ref> He wrote in a letter to [[Paul Derm\u00e9e]]: \"All things considered, I think in fact it is better to adopt surrealism than supernaturalism, which I first used\" [''Tout bien examin\u00e9, je crois en effet qu'il vaut mieux adopter surr\u00e9alisme que surnaturalisme que j'avais d'abord employ\u00e9''].<ref>Jean-Paul Cl\u00e9bert, ''Dictionnaire du surr\u00e9alisme'', A.T.P. & Le Seuil, Chamali\u00e8res, p. 17, 1996.</ref>\n\nApollinaire used the term in his program notes for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]], ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'', which premiered 18 May 1917. ''Parade'' had a one-act scenario by [[Jean Cocteau]] and was performed with music by [[Erik Satie]]. Cocteau described the ballet as \"realistic\". Apollinaire went further, describing ''Parade'' as \"surrealistic\":<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150922015316/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-07112005-201540/unrestricted/Doyle_dis.pdf Tracy A.

We may expect it to bring about profound changes in our arts and manners through universal joyfulness, for it is only natural, after all, that they keep pace with scientific and industrial progress. (Apollinaire, 1917)<ref>Vassiliki Kolocotroni, Jane Goldman, and Olga Taxidou, ''Modernism: An Anthology of Sources and Documents'', University of Chicago Press, 1998, 211.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe term was taken up again by Apollinaire, both as subtitle and in the preface to his play ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias|Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias: Drame surr\u00e9aliste]]'',<ref>Gascoyne, p. 39</ref> which was written in 1903 and first performed in 1917.<ref>Sams, p. 282</ref>\n\n[[World War I]] scattered the writers and artists who had been based in Paris, and in the interim many became involved with Dada, believing that excessive rational thought and [[bourgeois]] values had brought the conflict of the war upon the world. The Dadaists protested with [[anti-art]] gatherings, performances, writings and art works. After the war, when they returned to Paris, the Dada activities continued.\n\nDuring the war, [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], who had trained in medicine and psychiatry, served in a [[Neurology|neurological]] hospital where he used [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychoanalytic methods with soldiers suffering from [[shell-shock]]. Meeting the young writer [[Jacques Vach\u00e9]], Breton felt that Vach\u00e9 was the spiritual son of writer and [[pataphysics]] founder [[Alfred Jarry]].  He admired the young writer's anti-social attitude and disdain for established artistic tradition. Later Breton wrote, \"In literature, I was successively taken with [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], with Jarry, with Apollinaire, with [[Germain Nouveau|Nouveau]], with [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont|Lautr\u00e9amont]], but it is Jacques Vach\u00e9 to whom I owe the most.\"<ref>Breton, \"Vach\u00e9 is surrealist in me\", in ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''.</ref>\n\nBack in Paris, Breton joined in Dada activities and started the literary journal ''[[Litt\u00e9rature (magazine)|Litt\u00e9rature]]'' along with [[Louis Aragon]] and [[Philippe Soupault]]. They began experimenting with [[Surrealist automatism|automatic writing]]\u2014spontaneously writing without censoring their thoughts\u2014and published the writings, as well as accounts of dreams, in the magazine. Breton and Soupault continued writing evolving their techniques of automatism and published ''[[Les Champs Magn\u00e9tiques|The Magnetic Fields]]'' (1920).\n\nBy October 1924 two rival Surrealist groups had formed to publish a [[Surrealist Manifesto]]. Each claimed to be successors of a revolution launched by Appolinaire. One group, led by [[Yvan Goll]] consisted of [[Pierre Albert-Birot]], [[Paul Derm\u00e9e]], [[C\u00e9line Arnauld]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], [[Marcel Arland]], [[Joseph Delteil]], [[Jean Painlev\u00e9]] and [[Robert Delaunay]], among others<ref>G\u00e9rard Durozoi, An excerpt from History of the Surrealist Movement, Chapter Two, 1924-1929, Salvation for Us Is Nowhere, translation by Alison Anderson, U of Chicago Press, pp. 63-74, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-226-17411-2}}.</ref> The group led by Andr\u00e9 Breton claimed that [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] was a better tactic for societal change than those of Dada, as led by Tzara, who was now among their rivals.

They also looked to the [[Dialectical#Marxist dialectics|Marxist dialectic]] and the work of such theorists as [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nFreud's work with free association, dream analysis, and the unconscious was of utmost importance to the Surrealists in developing methods to liberate imagination. They embraced [[idiosyncrasy]], while rejecting the idea of an underlying madness. As Dal\u00ed later proclaimed, \"There is only one difference between a madman and me. I am not mad.\"<ref name=\"Diary of a Genius\"/>\n\nBeside the use of dream analysis, they emphasized that \"one could combine inside the same frame, elements not normally found together to produce illogical and startling effects.\"<ref name=\"PynchonSurralism\"/> Breton included the idea of the startling juxtapositions in his 1924 manifesto, taking it in turn from a 1918 essay by poet [[Pierre Reverdy]], which said: \"a juxtaposition of two more or less distant realities. The more the relationship between the two juxtaposed realities is distant and true, the stronger the image will be\u2212the greater its emotional power and poetic reality.\"<ref name=\"Breton (1924)\">Breton (1924) ''[http://www.tcf.ua.edu/Classes/Jbutler/T340/SurManifesto/ManifestoOfSurrealism.htm Manifesto of Surrealism].'' [[Pierre Reverdy]]'s comment was published in his journal ''Nord-Sud'', March 1918</ref>\n\nThe group aimed to revolutionize human experience, in its personal, cultural, social, and political aspects.  They wanted to free people from false rationality, and restrictive customs and structures. Breton proclaimed that the true aim of Surrealism was \"long live the social revolution, and it alone!\" To this goal, at various times Surrealists aligned with [[communism]] and [[anarchism]].\n\nIn 1924 two Surrealist factions declared their philosophy in two separate Surrealist Manifestos. That same year the [[Bureau of Surrealist Research]] was established, and began publishing the journal ''[[La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste]]''.\n\n===Surrealist Manifestos===\n[[File:Yvan Goll, Surr\u00e9alisme, Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme, Volume 1, Number 1, October 1, 1924, cover by Robert Delaunay.jpg|thumb|[[Yvan Goll]], ''Surr\u00e9alisme'', ''Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme'',<ref name=\"Surr\u00e9alisme\">[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&d=bmtnaaj19241001-01&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------# Surr\u00e9alisme, ''Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme'', Volume 1, Number 1, 1 October 1924, Blue Mountain Project]</ref> Volume 1, Number 1, October 1, 1924, cover by [[Robert Delaunay]]]]\n{{main|Surrealist Manifesto}}\nLeading up to 1924, two rival surrealist groups had formed.

He included citations of the influences on Surrealism, examples of Surrealist works, and discussion of Surrealist automatism. He provided the following definitions:\n\n{{quotation|'''Dictionary:''' Surrealism, n.

Breton initially doubted that visual arts could even be useful in the Surrealist movement since they appeared to be less malleable and open to chance and [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]]. This caution was overcome by the discovery of such techniques as [[frottage (art)|frottage]] and [[decalcomania]].\n\nSoon more visual artists became involved, including [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Valentine Hugo]], [[M\u00e9ret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Kansuke Yamamoto (artist)|Kansuke Yamamoto]] and later after the second war: [[Enrico Donati]]. Though Breton admired [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] and courted them to join the movement, they remained peripheral.<ref name=\"tomkins\">[[Calvin Tomkins|Tomkins, Calvin]], ''Duchamp: A Biography''. Henry Holt and Company, Inc, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8050-5789-7}}</ref> More writers also joined, including former Dadaist [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Ren\u00e9 Char]], and [[Georges Sadoul]].\n\n[[File:Masson automatic drawing.jpg|thumb|[[Andr\u00e9 Masson]]. Automatic Drawing. 1924. Ink on paper, 23.5 x 20.6 cm. [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.]]\nIn 1925 an autonomous Surrealist group formed in Brussels. The group included the musician, poet, and artist [[E. L. T. Mesens]], painter and writer [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]], [[Paul Noug\u00e9]], [[Marcel Lecomte]], and [[Andr\u00e9 Souris]]. In 1927 they were joined by the writer [[Louis Scutenaire]]. They corresponded regularly with the Paris group, and in 1927 both Goemans and Magritte moved to Paris and frequented Breton's circle.<ref name=\"grove\"/> The artists, with their roots in [[Dada]] and [[Cubism]], the abstraction of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Expressionism]], and [[Post-Impressionism]], also reached to older \"bloodlines\" or [[Proto-Surrealism|proto-surrealists]] such as [[Hieronymus Bosch]], and the so-called primitive and naive arts.\n\n[[Andr\u00e9 Masson]]'s [[automatic drawing]]s of 1923 are often used as the point of the acceptance of visual arts and the break from Dada, since they reflect the influence of the idea of the [[unconscious mind]]. Another example is Giacometti's 1925 ''Torso'', which marked his movement to simplified forms and inspiration from preclassical sculpture.\n\nHowever, a striking example of the line used to divide Dada and Surrealism among art experts is the pairing of 1925's [[Little Machine Constructed by Minimax Dadamax in Person|''Little Machine Constructed by Minimax Dadamax in Person (Von minimax dadamax selbst konstruiertes maschinchen)'']]<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1129 Link to Guggenheim collection] with reproduction of the painting and further information.</ref> with ''The Kiss (Le Baiser)''<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1132 Link to Guggenheim collection] with reproduction of the painting and further information.</ref> from 1927 by Max Ernst. The first is generally held to have a distance, and erotic subtext, whereas the second presents an erotic act openly and directly. In the second the influence of [[Joan Mir\u00f3|Mir\u00f3]] and the drawing style of [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] is visible with the use of fluid curving and intersecting lines and colour, whereas the first takes a directness that would later be influential in movements such as [[Pop art]].\n[[File:The Red Tower.jpg|left|thumb|[[Giorgio de Chirico]], ''The Red Tower (La Tour Rouge)'', 1913, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]]]\nGiorgio de Chirico, and his previous development of [[metaphysical art]], was one of the important joining figures between the philosophical and visual aspects of Surrealism. Between 1911 and 1917, he adopted an unornamented depictional style whose surface would be adopted by others later. ''The Red Tower (La tour rouge)'' from 1913 shows the stark colour contrasts and illustrative style later adopted by Surrealist painters. His 1914 ''The Nostalgia of the Poet (La Nostalgie du po\u00e8te)''<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/854 Link to Guggenheim collection] with reproduction of the painting and further information.</ref> has the figure turned away from the viewer, and the juxtaposition of a bust with glasses and a fish as a relief defies conventional explanation. He was also a writer whose novel ''[[Hebdomeros]]'' presents a series of dreamscapes with an unusual use of punctuation, syntax, and grammar designed to create an atmosphere and frame its images. His images, including set designs for the [[Ballets Russes]], would create a decorative form of Surrealism, and he would be an influence on the two artists who would be even more closely associated with Surrealism in the public mind: Dal\u00ed and Magritte. He would, however, leave the Surrealist group in 1928.\n\nIn 1924, Mir\u00f3 and Masson applied Surrealism to painting. The first Surrealist exhibition, ''La Peinture Surrealiste'', was held at Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. It displayed works by Masson, [[Man Ray]], [[Paul Klee]], Mir\u00f3, and others. The show confirmed that Surrealism had a component in the visual arts (though it had been initially debated whether this was possible), and techniques from Dada, such as [[photomontage]], were used. The following year, on March 26, 1926 Galerie Surr\u00e9aliste opened  with an exhibition by Man Ray. Breton published ''Surrealism and Painting'' in 1928 which summarized the movement to that point, though he continued to update the work until the 1960s.\n\n===Surrealist literature===\n{{See also|List of Surrealist poets}}\n[[File:MagrittePipe.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Treachery of Images]]'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]] (1929), featuring the famous declaration, \"This is not a pipe.\" [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]]]\n\nThe first Surrealist work, according to leader Br\u00eaton, was [[Les Chants de Maldoror]];<ref>Br\u00eaton, Andr\u00e9. ''Communicating Vessels''. Trans. Mary Ann Caws & Geoffrey T. Harris. London & Lincoln: U of Nebraska Press/Bison Books, 1990.</ref> and the first work written and published by his group of ''Surr\u00e9alistes'' was ''[[Les Champs Magn\u00e9tiques]]'' (May\u2013June 1919).<ref>Br\u00eaton, Andr\u00e9. Les Vases communicants. Paris: Gallimard, 1955.</ref> ''Litt\u00e9rature'' contained automatist works and accounts of dreams. The magazine and the portfolio both showed their disdain for literal meanings given to objects and focused rather on the undertones, the poetic undercurrents present. Not only did they give emphasis to the poetic undercurrents, but also to the connotations and the overtones which \"exist in ambiguous relationships to the visual images\"<ref>Vaneigem, Raoul. A Cavalier History of Surrealism. Trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith. Oakland: AK Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nBecause Surrealist writers seldom, if ever, appear to organize their thoughts and the images they present, some people find much of their work difficult to parse. This notion however is a superficial comprehension, prompted no doubt by Breton's initial emphasis on automatic writing as the main route toward a higher reality. But\u2014as in Breton's case\u2014much of what is presented as purely automatic is actually edited and very \"thought out\". Breton himself later admitted that automatic writing's centrality had been overstated, and other elements were introduced, especially as the growing involvement of visual artists in the movement forced the issue, since automatic painting required a rather more strenuous set of approaches. Thus such elements as collage were introduced, arising partly from an ideal of startling juxtapositions as revealed in [[Pierre Reverdy]]'s poetry. And\u2014as in Magritte's case (where there is no obvious recourse to either automatic techniques or collage)\u2014the very notion of convulsive joining became a tool for revelation in and of itself. Surrealism was meant to be always in flux\u2014to be more modern than modern\u2014and so it was natural there should be a rapid shuffling of the philosophy as new challenges arose.\n\nSurrealists revived interest in Isidore Ducasse, known by his pseudonym [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont]], and for the line \"beautiful as the chance meeting on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella\", and [[Arthur Rimbaud]], two late 19th-century writers believed to be the precursors of Surrealism.\n\nExamples of Surrealist literature are Artaud's ''Le P\u00e8se-Nerfs'' (1926), Aragon's ''[[Irene's Cunt]]'' (1927), P\u00e9ret's ''Death to the Pigs'' (1929), Crevel's ''Mr. Knife Miss Fork'' (1931), [[Sadegh Hedayat]]'s ''[[the Blind Owl]]'' (1937), and Breton's ''Sur la route de San Romano'' (1948).\n\n''[[La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste]]'' continued publication into 1929 with most pages densely packed with columns of text, but also included reproductions of art, among them works by de Chirico, Ernst, Masson, and Man Ray. Other works included books, poems, pamphlets, automatic texts and theoretical tracts.\n\n===Surrealist films===\n{{Main|Surrealist cinema}}\nEarly films by Surrealists include:\n* ''[[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]]'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]] (1924)\n* ''[[The Seashell and the Clergyman|La Coquille et le clergyman]]'' by [[Germaine Dulac]], screenplay by Antonin Artaud (1928)\n* ''[[L'\u00c9toile de mer]]'' by Man Ray (1928)\n* ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' by Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Salvador Dal\u00ed (1929)\n* ''[[L'\u00c2ge d'Or]]'' by Bu\u00f1uel and Dal\u00ed (1930)\n* ''[[The Blood of a Poet|Le sang d'un po\u00e8te]]'' by Jean Cocteau (1930)\n\n===Surrealist theatre===\nThe word ''surrealist'' was first used by Apollinaire to describe his 1917 play ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias|Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias]]'' (\"The Breasts of Tiresias\"), which was later [[Les mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias|adapted into an opera]] by [[Francis Poulenc]].\n\nAntonin Artaud, an early Surrealist, rejected the majority of Western theatre as a perversion of its original intent, which he felt should be a mystical, metaphysical experience. He thought that rational discourse comprised \"falsehood and illusion\". Theorising a new theatrical form that would be immediate and direct, that would link the unconscious minds of performers and spectators in a sort of ritual event, Artaud created the [[Theatre of Cruelty]], in which emotions, feelings, and the metaphysical were expressed not through language but physically, creating a mythological, archetypal, allegorical vision, closely related to the world of dreams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |title=The Theatre Of The Absurd |publisher=Arts.gla.ac.uk |date= |access-date=2009-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823075755/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |archive-date=2009-08-23 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holycross.edu/departments/theatre/eisser/semiotics.html |title=Artaud and Semiotics |publisher=Holycross.edu |date= |access-date=2009-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906153307/http://www.holycross.edu/departments/theatre/eisser/semiotics.html |archive-date=2008-09-06 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe other major theatre practitioner to have experimented with surrealism in the theatre is the Spanish playwright and director [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], particularly in his plays ''[[The Public (play)|The Public]]'' (1930), ''[[When Five Years Pass]]'' (1931), and ''[[Play Without a Title]]'' (1935). Other surrealist plays include Aragon's ''Backs to the Wall'' (1925) and [[Roger Vitrac]]'s ''The Mysteries of Love'' (1927) and ''Victor, or The Children Take Over'' (1928).<ref>Louis Aragon, ''Backs to the Wall'', in ''The Drama Review'' 18.4 (Dec. 1974): 88-107; Roger Vitrac, ''The Mysteries of Love'', in ''Theater of the Avant-Garde 1890-1950: A Critical Anthology.''

New Haven and London: Yale UP, 2001. 421-495.</ref>\n\n===Surrealist music===\n{{Main|Surrealist music}}\nIn the 1920s several composers were influenced by Surrealism, or by individuals in the Surrealist movement. Among them were [[Bohuslav Martin\u016f]], [[Andr\u00e9 Souris]], [[Erik Satie]], and [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]], who stated that his work ''Arcana'' was drawn from a dream sequence.<ref>Bernard, Jonathan W. \"Edgard Var\u00e9se's \u201cArcana\u201d.\" American Symphony Orchestra. Leon Botstein. Web. http://americansymphony.org/arcana/</ref> Souris in particular was associated with the movement: he had a long relationship with Magritte, and worked on [[Paul Noug\u00e9]]'s publication ''Adieu Marie''.\n\n[[Germaine Tailleferre]] of the French group [[Les Six]] wrote several works which could be considered to be inspired by Surrealism{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}, including the 1948 ballet ''Paris-Magie'' (scenario by [[Lise Deharme]]), the operas ''La Petite Sir\u00e8ne'' (book by Philippe Soupault) and ''Le Ma\u00eetre'' (book by Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco).<ref>[https://books.google.es/books?id=V-bSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT467&redir_esc=y Robert Shapiro, ''Les Six: The French Composers and Their Mentors Jean Cocteau and Erik Satie''.] London: Peter Owen, 2014. 467. {{ISBN|9780720617740}}</ref> Tailleferre also wrote popular songs to texts by Claude Marci, the wife of Henri Jeanson, whose portrait had been painted by Magritte in the 1930s.\n\nEven though Breton by 1946 responded rather negatively to the subject of music with his essay ''Silence is Golden'', later Surrealists, such as [[Paul Garon]], have been interested in\u2014and found parallels to\u2014Surrealism in the improvisation of [[jazz]] and the [[blues]]. Jazz and blues musicians have occasionally reciprocated this interest. For example, the [[1976 World Surrealist Exhibition]] included performances by [[David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards]].\n\n==Surrealism and international politics==\nSurrealism as a political force developed unevenly around the world: in some places more emphasis was on artistic practices, in other places on political practices, and in other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to supersede both the arts and politics. During the 1930s, the Surrealist idea spread from Europe to North America, South America (founding of the ''[[Mandr\u00e1gora]]'' group in Chile in 1938), [[Central America]], [[the Caribbean]], and throughout Asia, as both an artistic idea and as an ideology of political change.<ref name=\"Bauduin et al\">[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=135137902X Tessel M.

Breton and his comrades supported [[Leon Trotsky]] and his [[International Left Opposition]] for a while, though there was an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after World War II. Some Surrealists, such as [[Benjamin P\u00e9ret]], Mary Low, and Juan Bre\u00e1, aligned with forms of [[left communism]]. Others fought for complete liberty from political ideologies, like [[Wolfgang Paalen]], who, after Trotsky's assassination in Mexico, prepared a schism between art and politics through his counter-surrealist art-magazine [[DYN (magazine)|DYN]] and so prepared the ground for the abstract expressionists. Dal\u00ed supported capitalism and the fascist dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]] but cannot be said to represent a trend in Surrealism in this respect; in fact he was considered, by Breton and his associates, to have betrayed and left Surrealism. Benjamin P\u00e9ret, Mary Low and Juan Bre\u00e1 joined the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref name=\"Bauduin et al\" /><ref name=\"Spiteri\" />\n\nBreton's followers, along with the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]], were working for the \"liberation of man\". However, Breton's group refused to prioritize the [[proletarian]] struggle over radical creation such that their struggles with the Party made the late 1920s a turbulent time for both. Many individuals closely associated with Breton, notably Aragon, left his group to work more closely with the Communists.<ref name=\"Bauduin et al\" /><ref name=\"Spiteri\" />\n\nSurrealists have often sought to link their efforts with political ideals and activities. In the ''Declaration of January 27, 1925'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1925Surrealism.html |title=Modern History Sourcebook: A Surrealist Manifesto, 1925 |publisher=Fordham.edu |date=1925-01-27 |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> for example, members of the Paris-based [[Bureau of Surrealist Research]] (including Breton, Aragon and Artaud, as well as some two dozen others) declared their affinity for revolutionary politics. While this was initially a somewhat vague formulation, by the 1930s many Surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism. The foremost document of this tendency within Surrealism is the ''Manifesto for a Free Revolutionary Art'',<ref>[http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcSurrealism1.html Generation-online.org]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref> published under the names of Breton and [[Diego Rivera]], but actually co-authored by Breton and [[Leon Trotsky]].<ref>Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1933 the Surrealists\u2019 assertion that a '[[proletarian literature]]' within a capitalist society was impossible led to their break with the Association des Ecrivains et Artistes R\u00e9volutionnaires, and the expulsion of Breton, \u00c9luard and Crevel from the Communist Party.<ref name=\"grove\"/>\n\nIn 1925, the Paris Surrealist group and the extreme left of the [[French Communist Party]] came together to support [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd-el-Krim]], leader of the [[Rif]] uprising against French colonialism in [[Morocco]]. In an open letter to writer and French ambassador to Japan, [[Paul Claudel]], the Paris group announced:\n\n:\"We Surrealists pronounced ourselves in favour of changing the imperialist war, in its chronic and colonial form, into a civil war. Thus we placed our energies at the disposal of the revolution, of the proletariat and its struggles, and defined our attitude towards the colonial problem, and hence towards the colour question.\"\n\nThe anticolonial revolutionary and proletarian politics of \"Murderous Humanitarianism\" (1932) which was drafted mainly by Crevel, signed by Breton, \u00c9luard, P\u00e9ret, Tanguy, and the Martiniquan Surrealists [[Pierre Yoyotte]] and [[J.M. Monnerot]] perhaps makes it the original document of what is later called 'black Surrealism',<ref>[[Robin Kelley|Kelley, Robin D.G.]] ''A Poetics of Anticolonialism''. November 1999.</ref> although it is the contact between [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] and Breton in the 1940s in [[Martinique]] that really lead to the communication of what is known as 'black Surrealism'.\n\nAnticolonial revolutionary writers in the [[N\u00e9gritude]] movement of [[Martinique]], a French colony at the time, took up Surrealism as a revolutionary method - a critique of European culture and a radical subjective. This linked with other Surrealists and was very important for the subsequent development of Surrealism as a revolutionary praxis. The journal ''[[Tropiques]]'', featuring the work of C\u00e9saire along with [[Suzanne C\u00e9saire]], [[Ren\u00e9 M\u00e9nil]], [[Lucie Th\u00e9s\u00e9e]], [[Aristide Maug\u00e9e]] and others, was first published in 1941.<ref>[[Robin Kelley|Kelley, Robin D.G.]] \"Poetry and the Political Imagination: Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, Negritude, & the Applications of Surrealism\". July 2001</ref>\n\nIn 1938 Andr\u00e9 Breton traveled with his wife, the painter [[Jacqueline Lamba]], to [[Mexico]] to meet Trotsky (staying as the guest of Diego Rivera's former wife Guadalupe Marin), and there he met [[Frida Kahlo]] and saw her paintings for the first time. Breton declared Kahlo to be an \"innate\" Surrealist painter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fridakahlofans.com/chronologyenglish.html |title=Frida Kahlo, Paintings, Chronology, Biography, Bio |publisher=Fridakahlofans.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref>\n\n===Internal politics===\nIn 1929 the satellite group associated with the journal ''Le Grand Jeu'', including [[Roger Gilbert-Lecomte]], [[Maurice Henry]] and the Czech painter [[Josef Sima]], was ostracized. Also in February, Breton asked Surrealists to assess their \"degree of moral competence\", and theoretical refinements included in the second ''[[Surrealist Manifesto|manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme]]'' excluded anyone reluctant to commit to collective action, a list which included Leiris, Limbour, Morise, Baron, Queneau, Pr\u00e9vert, Desnos, Masson and Boiffard. Excluded members launched a counterattack, sharply criticizing Breton in the pamphlet ''[[Un Cadavre]]'', which featured a picture of Breton wearing a [[crown of thorns]]. The pamphlet drew upon an earlier act of subversion by likening Breton to [[Anatole France]], whose unquestioned value Breton had challenged in 1924.n\n\nThe disunion of 1929-30 and the effects of ''Un Cadavre'' had very little negative impact upon Surrealism as Breton saw it, since core figures such as Aragon, Crevel, Dal\u00ed and Bu\u00f1uel remained true the idea of group action, at least for the time being. The success (or the controversy) of Dal\u00ed and Bu\u00f1uel's film [[L'Age d'Or]] in December 1930 had a regenerative effect, drawing a number of new recruits, and encouraging countless new artistic works the following year and throughout the 1930s.\n\nDisgruntled surrealists moved to the periodical ''[[Documents (magazine)|Documents]]'', edited by [[Georges Bataille]], whose anti-idealist materialism formed a hybrid Surrealism intending to expose the base instincts of humans.<ref name=\"grove\"/><ref name=\"pompidou\">[http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm Surrealist Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918070327/http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm |date=2012-09-18 }} from [[Centre Pompidou]]. Retrieved March 20, 2007.</ref> To the dismay of many, ''Documents'' fizzled out in 1931, just as Surrealism seemed to be gathering more steam.\n\nThere were a number of reconciliations after this period of disunion, such as between Breton and Bataille, while Aragon left the group after committing himself to the [[French Communist Party]] in 1932. More members were ousted over the years for a variety of infractions, both political and personal, while others left in pursuit of their own style.\n\nBy the end of World War II the surrealist group led by Andr\u00e9 Breton decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote \"It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself.\"<ref name=\"anarchosurrealism\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/history/1919-1950-the-politics-of-surrealism |title=1919-1950: The politics of Surrealism by Nick Heath |publisher=Libcom.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> \"Breton was consistent in his support for the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Anarchiste|francophone Anarchist Federation]] and he continued to offer his solidarity after the [[Platformism|Platformists]] supporting Fontenis transformed the FA into the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Communiste Libertaire.

He refused to take sides on the splits in the French anarchist movement and both he and Peret expressed solidarity as well with the new [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration anarchiste]] set up by the synthesist anarchists and worked in the Antifascist Committees of the 60s alongside the FA.\"<ref name=\"anarchosurrealism\"/>\n\n==Golden age==\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:The Persistence of Memory.jpg|thumb|[[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'' (1931), [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[Manhattan]]]] -->\nThroughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in London]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Another English Surrealist group developed [[Birmingham Surrealists|in Birmingham]], meanwhile, and was distinguished by its opposition to the London surrealists and preferences for surrealism's French heartland. The two groups would reconcile later in the decade.\n\nDal\u00ed and Magritte created the most widely recognized images of the movement. Dal\u00ed joined the group in 1929, and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.\n\nSurrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth; stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, in order to evoke empathy from the viewer.\n\n1931 was a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: Magritte's ''Voice of Space (La Voix des airs)''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/2593?tmpl=component&print=1 |title=Surrealism - Magritte - Voice of Space |publisher=Guggenheim Collection |date= |access-date=2009-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319041151/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/2593?tmpl=component&print=1 |archive-date=2015-03-19 |df= }}</ref> is an example of this process, where three large spheres representing bells hang above a landscape. Another Surrealist landscape from this same year is Yves Tanguy's ''[[:File:Premontory Palace.jpg|Promontory Palace (Palais promontoire)]]'', with its molten forms and liquid shapes. Liquid shapes became the trademark of Dal\u00ed, particularly in his ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', which features the image of watches that sag as if they were melting.\n\nThe characteristics of this style\u2014a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological\u2014came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the [[modernism|modern]] period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be \"made whole with one's individuality\".\n\nBetween 1930 and 1933, the Surrealist Group in Paris issued the periodical ''[[Le Surr\u00e9alisme au service de la r\u00e9volution]]'' as the successor of ''La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste''.\n\nFrom 1936 through 1938 [[Wolfgang Paalen]], [[Gordon Onslow Ford]], and [[Roberto Matta]] joined the group. Paalen contributed [[Fumage]] and Onslow Ford [[Coulage]] as new pictorial automatic techniques.\n\nLong after personal, political and professional tensions fragmented the Surrealist group, Magritte and Dal\u00ed continued to define a visual program in the arts. This program reached beyond painting, to encompass photography as well, as can be seen from a Man Ray self-portrait, whose use of assemblage influenced [[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s collage boxes.\n[[File:L'Ange du Foyeur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Ernst]], ''L'Ange du Foyer ou le Triomphe du Surr\u00e9alisme'' (1937), private collection.]]\nDuring the 1930s [[Peggy Guggenheim]], an important American art collector, married Max Ernst and began promoting work by other Surrealists such as Yves Tanguy and the British artist [[John Tunnard]].\n\n'''Major exhibitions in the 1930s'''\n* 1936 - ''[[London International Surrealist Exhibition]]'' is organised in London by the art historian [[Herbert Read]], with an introduction by Andr\u00e9 Breton.\n* 1936 - [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York shows the exhibition ''[[Fantastic Art]], Dada and Surrealism''.\n* 1938 - A new ''[[Exposition Internationale du Surr\u00e9alisme]]'' was held at the Beaux-arts Gallery, Paris, with more than 60 artists from different countries, and showed around 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs and installations. The Surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act and called on Marcel Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray and others to do so. At the exhibition's entrance Salvador Dal\u00ed placed his [[Rainy Taxi]] (an old taxi rigged to produce a steady drizzle of water down the inside of the windows, and a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat and a blond mannequin crawling with live snails in the back) greeted the patrons who were in full evening dress. ''Surrealist Street'' filled one side of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various Surrealists. Paalen and Duchamp designed the main hall to seem like cave with 1,200 coal bags suspended from the ceiling over a coal brazier with a single light bulb which provided the only lighting, as well as the floor covered with humid leaves and mud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/interviews/hirschhorn/popup_8.html |title=Marcel Duchamp |publisher=Toutfait.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> The patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art. On the floor Wolfgang Paalen created a small lake with grasses and the aroma of roasting coffee filled the air. Much to the Surrealists' satisfaction the exhibition scandalized the viewers.<ref name=\"tomkins\"/>\n\n===World War II and the Post War period===\n[[File:Indefinite Divisibility.jpg|thumb|[[Yves Tanguy]] ''Indefinite Divisibility'' 1942, [[Albright Knox Art Gallery]], Buffalo, New York]]\nWorld War II created havoc not only for the general population of Europe but especially for the European artists and writers that opposed Fascism and Nazism. Many important artists fled to North America and relative safety in the United States. The art community in New York City in particular was already grappling with Surrealist ideas and several artists like [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Robert Motherwell]] converged closely with the surrealist artists themselves, albeit with some suspicion and reservations. Ideas concerning the unconscious and dream imagery were quickly embraced. By the Second World War, the taste of the American [[avant-garde]] in New York City swung decisively towards [[Abstract Expressionism]] with the support of key taste makers, including [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Leo Steinberg]] and [[Clement Greenberg]]. However, it should not be easily forgotten that Abstract Expressionism itself grew directly out of the meeting of American (particularly New York) artists with European Surrealists self-exiled during World War II. In particular, Gorky and Paalen influenced the development of this American art form, which, as Surrealism did, celebrated the instantaneous human act as the well-spring of creativity. The early work of many Abstract Expressionists reveals a tight bond between the more superficial aspects of both movements, and the emergence (at a later date) of aspects of [[Dadaist]]ic humor in such artists as [[Rauschenberg]] sheds an even starker light upon the connection. Up until the emergence of [[Pop Art]], Surrealism can be seen to have been the single most important influence on the sudden growth in American arts, and even in Pop, some of the humor manifested in Surrealism can be found, often turned to a cultural criticism.\n\nThe Second World War overshadowed, for a time, almost all intellectual and artistic production. In 1939 Wolfgang Paalen was the first to leave Paris for the New World as exile. After a long trip through the forests of British Columbia, he settled in Mexico and founded his influential art-magazine [[DYN (journal)|Dyn]]. In 1940 Yves Tanguy married American Surrealist painter [[Kay Sage]]. In 1941, Breton went to the United States, where he co-founded the short-lived magazine ''[[VVV (magazine)|VVV]]'' with Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, and the American artist [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]]. However, it was the American poet, [[Charles Henri Ford]], and his magazine ''[[View (magazine)|View]]'' which offered Breton a channel for promoting Surrealism in the United States. The ''View'' special issue on Duchamp was crucial for the public understanding of Surrealism in America. It stressed his connections to Surrealist methods, offered interpretations of his work by Breton, as well as Breton's view that Duchamp represented the bridge between early modern movements, such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] and [[Cubism]], to Surrealism. Wolfgang Paalen left the group in 1942 due to political/philosophical differences with Breton.\n\nThough the war proved disruptive for Surrealism, the works continued. Many Surrealist artists continued to explore their vocabularies, including Magritte. Many members of the Surrealist movement continued to correspond and meet. While Dal\u00ed may have been excommunicated by Breton, he neither abandoned his themes from the 1930s, including references to the \"persistence of time\" in a later painting, nor did he become a depictive pompier. His classic period did not represent so sharp a break with the past as some descriptions of his work might portray, and some, such as [[Andr\u00e9 Thirion]], argued that there were works of his after this period that continued to have some relevance for the movement.\n\nDuring the 1940s Surrealism's influence was also felt in England, America and the Netherlands where Gertrude Pape and her husband Theo van Baaren helped to popularize it in their publication The Clean Handkerchief.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Surrealist women : an international anthology|date=1998|publisher=University of Texas Press|others=Rosemont, Penelope.|isbn=978-0292770881|edition=1st|location=Austin|oclc=37782914|url=https://archive.org/details/surrealistwomeni00rose}}</ref> [[Mark Rothko]] took an interest in [[biomorphism|biomorphic]] figures, and in England [[Henry Moore]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] used or experimented with Surrealist techniques. However, [[Conroy Maddox]], one of the first British Surrealists whose work in this genre dated from 1935, remained within the movement, and organized an exhibition of current Surrealist work in 1978 in response to an earlier show which infuriated him because it did not properly represent Surrealism. Maddox's exhibition, titled ''Surrealism Unlimited'', was held in Paris and attracted international attention. He held his last one-man show in 2002, and died three years later.\nMagritte's work became more realistic in its depiction of actual objects, while maintaining the element of juxtaposition, such as in 1951's ''Personal Values (Les Valeurs Personnelles)''<ref>[http://www.sfmoma.org/MSoMA/newAWScreen.asp?awScreenNum=5139 SFmoma.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001014708/http://www.sfmoma.org/MSoMA/newAWScreen.asp?awScreenNum=5139 |date=October 1, 2008 }}</ref> and 1954's ''Empire of Light  (L\u2019Empire des lumi\u00e8res)''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/2594 |title=Artist - Magritte - Empire of Light - Large |publisher=Guggenheim Collection |date= January 1953|accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> Magritte continued to produce works which have entered artistic vocabulary, such as ''Castle in the Pyrenees (Le Ch\u00e2teau des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es)'',<ref>[https://artacademieparis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/magritte_Castle-in-the-Pyrenees.jpg Artacademieparis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510184620/https://artacademieparis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/magritte_Castle-in-the-Pyrenees.jpg |date=2018-05-10 }}</ref> which refers back to ''Voix'' from 1931, in its suspension over a landscape.\n\nOther figures from the Surrealist movement were expelled. Several of these artists, like [[Roberto Matta]] (by his own description) \"remained close to Surrealism\".<ref name=\"tomkins\"/>\n\nAfter the crushing of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], [[Endre Rozsda]] returned to Paris to continue creating his own word that had been transcended the surrealism. The preface to his first exhibition in the Furstenberg Gallery (1957) was written by Breton yet.<ref name=\"breton\">Breton, Andr\u00e9. ''Surrealism and Painting'', Icon, 1973</ref>\n\nMany new artists explicitly took up the Surrealist banner. [[Dorothea Tanning]] and [[Louise Bourgeois]] continued to work, for example, with Tanning's ''Rainy Day Canape'' from 1970. Duchamp continued to produce sculpture in secret including an installation with the realistic depiction of a woman viewable only through a peephole.\n\nBreton continued to write and espouse the importance of liberating the human mind, as with the publication ''[[The Tower of Light]]'' in 1952. Breton's return to France after the War, began a new phase of Surrealist activity in Paris, and his critiques of rationalism and dualism found a new audience. Breton insisted that Surrealism was an ongoing revolt against the reduction of humanity to market relationships, religious gestures and misery and to espouse the importance of liberating the human mind.\n\n'''Major exhibitions of the 1940s, '50s and '60s'''\n* 1942 - ''First Papers of Surrealism'' - New York - The Surrealists again called on Duchamp to design an exhibition. This time he wove a 3-dimensional web of string throughout the rooms of the space, in some cases making it almost impossible to see the works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/interviews/hirschhorn/popup_9.html |title=Marcel Duchamp |publisher=Toutfait.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> He made a secret arrangement with an associate's son to bring his friends to the opening of the show, so that when the finely dressed patrons arrived they found a dozen children in athletic clothes kicking and passing balls, and skipping rope.

While [[Guy Debord]] was critical of and distanced himself from Surrealism, others, such as [[Asger Jorn]], were explicitly using Surrealist techniques and methods. [[May 1968 events in France|The events of May 1968]] in France included a number of Surrealist ideas, and among the slogans the students spray-painted on the walls of the Sorbonne were familiar Surrealist ones. [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] would commemorate this in a painting titled ''May 1968.'' There were also groups who associated with both currents and were more attached to Surrealism, such as the [[Revolutionary Surrealist Group]].\n\nDuring the 1980s, behind the [[Iron Curtain]], Surrealism again entered into politics with an underground artistic opposition movement known as the [[Orange Alternative]]. The Orange Alternative was created in 1981 by [[Waldemar Fydrych]] (alias 'Major'), a graduate of history and art history at the University of [[Wroc\u0142aw]]. They used Surrealist symbolism and terminology in their large scale happenings organized in the major Polish cities during the [[Jaruzelski]] regime, and painted Surrealist graffiti on spots covering up anti-regime slogans. Major himself was the author of a \"Manifesto of Socialist Surrealism\". In this manifesto, he stated that the socialist (communist) system had become so Surrealistic that it could be seen as an expression of art itself.\n\nSurrealistic art also remains popular with museum patrons. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City held an exhibit, ''Two Private Eyes'', in 1999, and in 2001 [[Tate Modern]] held an exhibition of Surrealist art that attracted over 170,000 visitors. In 2002 the [[Metropolitan Museum|Met]] in New York City held a show, ''Desire Unbound'', and the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris a show called ''La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste''.\n\nSurrealists groups and literary publications have continued to be active up to the present day, with groups such as the [[Chicago Surrealist Group]], the Leeds Surrealist Group, and the Surrealist Group of Stockholm. [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]] of the Czech-Slovak Surrealists continues to make films and experiment with objects.\n\n==Impact of Surrealism==\nWhile Surrealism is typically associated with the arts, it has impacted many other fields. In this sense, Surrealism does not specifically refer only to self-identified \"Surrealists\", or those sanctioned by Breton, rather, it refers to a range of creative acts of revolt and efforts to liberate imagination.<ref>Vaneigem, Raoul (Dupuis Jules-Fran\u00e7ois), ''Histoire d\u00e9sinvolte du surr\u00e9alisme''.

One might say that Surrealist strands may be found in movements such as [[Free Jazz]] ([[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Cecil Taylor]] etc.) and even in the daily lives of people in confrontation with limiting social conditions.

The original Paris Surrealist Group was disbanded by member Jean Schuster in 1969, but another Parisian surrealist group was later formed. The current Surrealist Group of Paris has recently published the first issue of their new journal, ''Alcheringa''. The Group of Czech-Slovak Surrealists never disbanded, and continue to publish their journal ''Analogon'', which now spans 80 volumes.\n\n===Surrealism and the theatre===\nSurrealist theatre and Artaud's \"Theatre of Cruelty\" were inspirational to many within the group of playwrights that the critic Martin Esslin called the \"[[Theatre of the Absurd]]\" (in his 1963 book of the same name). Though not an organized movement, Esslin grouped these playwrights together based on some similarities of theme and technique; Esslin argues that these similarities may be traced to an influence from the Surrealists. [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] in particular was fond of Surrealism, claiming at one point that Breton was one of the most important thinkers in history.<ref>Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco.

We may expect it to bring about profound changes in our arts and manners through universal joyfulness, for it is only natural, after all, that they keep pace with scientific and industrial progress.

The Dadaists protested with [[anti-art]] gatherings, performances, writings and art works. After the war, when they returned to Paris, the Dada activities continued.\n\nDuring the war, [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], who had trained in medicine and psychiatry, served in a [[Neurology|neurological]] hospital where he used [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychoanalytic methods with soldiers suffering from [[shell-shock]]. Meeting the young writer [[Jacques Vach\u00e9]], Breton felt that Vach\u00e9 was the spiritual son of writer and [[pataphysics]] founder [[Alfred Jarry]].  He admired the young writer's anti-social attitude and disdain for established artistic tradition. Later Breton wrote, \"In literature, I was successively taken with [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], with Jarry, with Apollinaire, with [[Germain Nouveau|Nouveau]], with [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont|Lautr\u00e9amont]], but it is Jacques Vach\u00e9 to whom I owe the most.\"<ref>Breton, \"Vach\u00e9 is surrealist in me\", in ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''.</ref>\n\nBack in Paris, Breton joined in Dada activities and started the literary journal ''[[Litt\u00e9rature (magazine)|Litt\u00e9rature]]'' along with [[Louis Aragon]] and [[Philippe Soupault]]. They began experimenting with [[Surrealist automatism|automatic writing]]\u2014spontaneously writing without censoring their thoughts\u2014and published the writings, as well as accounts of dreams, in the magazine. Breton and Soupault continued writing evolving their techniques of automatism and published ''[[Les Champs Magn\u00e9tiques|The Magnetic Fields]]'' (1920).\n\nBy October 1924 two rival Surrealist groups had formed to publish a [[Surrealist Manifesto]]. Each claimed to be successors of a revolution launched by Appolinaire. One group, led by [[Yvan Goll]] consisted of [[Pierre Albert-Birot]], [[Paul Derm\u00e9e]], [[C\u00e9line Arnauld]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], [[Marcel Arland]], [[Joseph Delteil]], [[Jean Painlev\u00e9]] and [[Robert Delaunay]], among others<ref>G\u00e9rard Durozoi, An excerpt from History of the Surrealist Movement, Chapter Two, 1924-1929, Salvation for Us Is Nowhere, translation by Alison Anderson, U of Chicago Press, pp. 63-74, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-226-17411-2}}.</ref> The group led by Andr\u00e9 Breton claimed that [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] was a better tactic for societal change than those of Dada, as led by Tzara, who was now among their rivals.

They embraced [[idiosyncrasy]], while rejecting the idea of an underlying madness. As Dal\u00ed later proclaimed, \"There is only one difference between a madman and me. I am not mad.\"<ref name=\"Diary of a Genius\"/>\n\nBeside the use of dream analysis, they emphasized that \"one could combine inside the same frame, elements not normally found together to produce illogical and startling effects.\"<ref name=\"PynchonSurralism\"/> Breton included the idea of the startling juxtapositions in his 1924 manifesto, taking it in turn from a 1918 essay by poet [[Pierre Reverdy]], which said: \"a juxtaposition of two more or less distant realities.

They wanted to free people from false rationality, and restrictive customs and structures. Breton proclaimed that the true aim of Surrealism was \"long live the social revolution, and it alone!\" To this goal, at various times Surrealists aligned with [[communism]] and [[anarchism]].\n\nIn 1924 two Surrealist factions declared their philosophy in two separate Surrealist Manifestos.

He included citations of the influences on Surrealism, examples of Surrealist works, and discussion of Surrealist automatism. He provided the following definitions:\n\n{{quotation|'''Dictionary:''' Surrealism, n.

Breton initially doubted that visual arts could even be useful in the Surrealist movement since they appeared to be less malleable and open to chance and [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]]. This caution was overcome by the discovery of such techniques as [[frottage (art)|frottage]] and [[decalcomania]].\n\nSoon more visual artists became involved, including [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Valentine Hugo]], [[M\u00e9ret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Kansuke Yamamoto (artist)|Kansuke Yamamoto]] and later after the second war: [[Enrico Donati]]. Though Breton admired [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] and courted them to join the movement, they remained peripheral.<ref name=\"tomkins\">[[Calvin Tomkins|Tomkins, Calvin]], ''Duchamp: A Biography''. Henry Holt and Company, Inc, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8050-5789-7}}</ref> More writers also joined, including former Dadaist [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Ren\u00e9 Char]], and [[Georges Sadoul]].\n\n[[File:Masson automatic drawing.jpg|thumb|[[Andr\u00e9 Masson]]. Automatic Drawing. 1924. Ink on paper, 23.5 x 20.6 cm. [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.]]\nIn 1925 an autonomous Surrealist group formed in Brussels. The group included the musician, poet, and artist [[E. L. T. Mesens]], painter and writer [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]], [[Paul Noug\u00e9]], [[Marcel Lecomte]], and [[Andr\u00e9 Souris]]. In 1927 they were joined by the writer [[Louis Scutenaire]]. They corresponded regularly with the Paris group, and in 1927 both Goemans and Magritte moved to Paris and frequented Breton's circle.<ref name=\"grove\"/> The artists, with their roots in [[Dada]] and [[Cubism]], the abstraction of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Expressionism]], and [[Post-Impressionism]], also reached to older \"bloodlines\" or [[Proto-Surrealism|proto-surrealists]] such as [[Hieronymus Bosch]], and the so-called primitive and naive arts.\n\n[[Andr\u00e9 Masson]]'s [[automatic drawing]]s of 1923 are often used as the point of the acceptance of visual arts and the break from Dada, since they reflect the influence of the idea of the [[unconscious mind]]. Another example is Giacometti's 1925 ''Torso'', which marked his movement to simplified forms and inspiration from preclassical sculpture.\n\nHowever, a striking example of the line used to divide Dada and Surrealism among art experts is the pairing of 1925's [[Little Machine Constructed by Minimax Dadamax in Person|''Little Machine Constructed by Minimax Dadamax in Person (Von minimax dadamax selbst konstruiertes maschinchen)'']]<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1129 Link to Guggenheim collection] with reproduction of the painting and further information.</ref> with ''The Kiss (Le Baiser)''<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1132 Link to Guggenheim collection] with reproduction of the painting and further information.</ref> from 1927 by Max Ernst. The first is generally held to have a distance, and erotic subtext, whereas the second presents an erotic act openly and directly. In the second the influence of [[Joan Mir\u00f3|Mir\u00f3]] and the drawing style of [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] is visible with the use of fluid curving and intersecting lines and colour, whereas the first takes a directness that would later be influential in movements such as [[Pop art]].\n[[File:The Red Tower.jpg|left|thumb|[[Giorgio de Chirico]], ''The Red Tower (La Tour Rouge)'', 1913, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]]]\nGiorgio de Chirico, and his previous development of [[metaphysical art]], was one of the important joining figures between the philosophical and visual aspects of Surrealism. Between 1911 and 1917, he adopted an unornamented depictional style whose surface would be adopted by others later. ''The Red Tower (La tour rouge)'' from 1913 shows the stark colour contrasts and illustrative style later adopted by Surrealist painters. His 1914 ''The Nostalgia of the Poet (La Nostalgie du po\u00e8te)''<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/854 Link to Guggenheim collection] with reproduction of the painting and further information.</ref> has the figure turned away from the viewer, and the juxtaposition of a bust with glasses and a fish as a relief defies conventional explanation. He was also a writer whose novel ''[[Hebdomeros]]'' presents a series of dreamscapes with an unusual use of punctuation, syntax, and grammar designed to create an atmosphere and frame its images. His images, including set designs for the [[Ballets Russes]], would create a decorative form of Surrealism, and he would be an influence on the two artists who would be even more closely associated with Surrealism in the public mind: Dal\u00ed and Magritte. He would, however, leave the Surrealist group in 1928.\n\nIn 1924, Mir\u00f3 and Masson applied Surrealism to painting. The first Surrealist exhibition, ''La Peinture Surrealiste'', was held at Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. It displayed works by Masson, [[Man Ray]], [[Paul Klee]], Mir\u00f3, and others. The show confirmed that Surrealism had a component in the visual arts (though it had been initially debated whether this was possible), and techniques from Dada, such as [[photomontage]], were used. The following year, on March 26, 1926 Galerie Surr\u00e9aliste opened  with an exhibition by Man Ray. Breton published ''Surrealism and Painting'' in 1928 which summarized the movement to that point, though he continued to update the work until the 1960s.\n\n===Surrealist literature===\n{{See also|List of Surrealist poets}}\n[[File:MagrittePipe.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Treachery of Images]]'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]] (1929), featuring the famous declaration, \"This is not a pipe.\" [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]]]\n\nThe first Surrealist work, according to leader Br\u00eaton, was [[Les Chants de Maldoror]];<ref>Br\u00eaton, Andr\u00e9. ''Communicating Vessels''. Trans. Mary Ann Caws & Geoffrey T. Harris. London & Lincoln: U of Nebraska Press/Bison Books, 1990.</ref> and the first work written and published by his group of ''Surr\u00e9alistes'' was ''[[Les Champs Magn\u00e9tiques]]'' (May\u2013June 1919).<ref>Br\u00eaton, Andr\u00e9. Les Vases communicants. Paris: Gallimard, 1955.</ref> ''Litt\u00e9rature'' contained automatist works and accounts of dreams. The magazine and the portfolio both showed their disdain for literal meanings given to objects and focused rather on the undertones, the poetic undercurrents present. Not only did they give emphasis to the poetic undercurrents, but also to the connotations and the overtones which \"exist in ambiguous relationships to the visual images\"<ref>Vaneigem, Raoul. A Cavalier History of Surrealism. Trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith. Oakland: AK Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nBecause Surrealist writers seldom, if ever, appear to organize their thoughts and the images they present, some people find much of their work difficult to parse. This notion however is a superficial comprehension, prompted no doubt by Breton's initial emphasis on automatic writing as the main route toward a higher reality. But\u2014as in Breton's case\u2014much of what is presented as purely automatic is actually edited and very \"thought out\". Breton himself later admitted that automatic writing's centrality had been overstated, and other elements were introduced, especially as the growing involvement of visual artists in the movement forced the issue, since automatic painting required a rather more strenuous set of approaches. Thus such elements as collage were introduced, arising partly from an ideal of startling juxtapositions as revealed in [[Pierre Reverdy]]'s poetry. And\u2014as in Magritte's case (where there is no obvious recourse to either automatic techniques or collage)\u2014the very notion of convulsive joining became a tool for revelation in and of itself. Surrealism was meant to be always in flux\u2014to be more modern than modern\u2014and so it was natural there should be a rapid shuffling of the philosophy as new challenges arose.\n\nSurrealists revived interest in Isidore Ducasse, known by his pseudonym [[Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont]], and for the line \"beautiful as the chance meeting on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella\", and [[Arthur Rimbaud]], two late 19th-century writers believed to be the precursors of Surrealism.\n\nExamples of Surrealist literature are Artaud's ''Le P\u00e8se-Nerfs'' (1926), Aragon's ''[[Irene's Cunt]]'' (1927), P\u00e9ret's ''Death to the Pigs'' (1929), Crevel's ''Mr. Knife Miss Fork'' (1931), [[Sadegh Hedayat]]'s ''[[the Blind Owl]]'' (1937), and Breton's ''Sur la route de San Romano'' (1948).\n\n''[[La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste]]'' continued publication into 1929 with most pages densely packed with columns of text, but also included reproductions of art, among them works by de Chirico, Ernst, Masson, and Man Ray. Other works included books, poems, pamphlets, automatic texts and theoretical tracts.\n\n===Surrealist films===\n{{Main|Surrealist cinema}}\nEarly films by Surrealists include:\n* ''[[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]]'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]] (1924)\n* ''[[The Seashell and the Clergyman|La Coquille et le clergyman]]'' by [[Germaine Dulac]], screenplay by Antonin Artaud (1928)\n* ''[[L'\u00c9toile de mer]]'' by Man Ray (1928)\n* ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' by Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Salvador Dal\u00ed (1929)\n* ''[[L'\u00c2ge d'Or]]'' by Bu\u00f1uel and Dal\u00ed (1930)\n* ''[[The Blood of a Poet|Le sang d'un po\u00e8te]]'' by Jean Cocteau (1930)\n\n===Surrealist theatre===\nThe word ''surrealist'' was first used by Apollinaire to describe his 1917 play ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias|Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias]]'' (\"The Breasts of Tiresias\"), which was later [[Les mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias|adapted into an opera]] by [[Francis Poulenc]].\n\nAntonin Artaud, an early Surrealist, rejected the majority of Western theatre as a perversion of its original intent, which he felt should be a mystical, metaphysical experience. He thought that rational discourse comprised \"falsehood and illusion\". Theorising a new theatrical form that would be immediate and direct, that would link the unconscious minds of performers and spectators in a sort of ritual event, Artaud created the [[Theatre of Cruelty]], in which emotions, feelings, and the metaphysical were expressed not through language but physically, creating a mythological, archetypal, allegorical vision, closely related to the world of dreams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |title=The Theatre Of The Absurd |publisher=Arts.gla.ac.uk |date= |access-date=2009-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823075755/http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Absurd.htm |archive-date=2009-08-23 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holycross.edu/departments/theatre/eisser/semiotics.html |title=Artaud and Semiotics |publisher=Holycross.edu |date= |access-date=2009-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906153307/http://www.holycross.edu/departments/theatre/eisser/semiotics.html |archive-date=2008-09-06 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe other major theatre practitioner to have experimented with surrealism in the theatre is the Spanish playwright and director [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], particularly in his plays ''[[The Public (play)|The Public]]'' (1930), ''[[When Five Years Pass]]'' (1931), and ''[[Play Without a Title]]'' (1935).

Jazz and blues musicians have occasionally reciprocated this interest. For example, the [[1976 World Surrealist Exhibition]] included performances by [[David \"Honeyboy\" Edwards]].\n\n==Surrealism and international politics==\nSurrealism as a political force developed unevenly around the world: in some places more emphasis was on artistic practices, in other places on political practices, and in other places still, Surrealist praxis looked to supersede both the arts and politics. During the 1930s, the Surrealist idea spread from Europe to North America, South America (founding of the ''[[Mandr\u00e1gora]]'' group in Chile in 1938), [[Central America]], [[the Caribbean]], and throughout Asia, as both an artistic idea and as an ideology of political change.<ref name=\"Bauduin et al\">[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=135137902X Tessel M.

Breton and his comrades supported [[Leon Trotsky]] and his [[International Left Opposition]] for a while, though there was an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after World War II. Some Surrealists, such as [[Benjamin P\u00e9ret]], Mary Low, and Juan Bre\u00e1, aligned with forms of [[left communism]]. Others fought for complete liberty from political ideologies, like [[Wolfgang Paalen]], who, after Trotsky's assassination in Mexico, prepared a schism between art and politics through his counter-surrealist art-magazine [[DYN (magazine)|DYN]] and so prepared the ground for the abstract expressionists. Dal\u00ed supported capitalism and the fascist dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]] but cannot be said to represent a trend in Surrealism in this respect; in fact he was considered, by Breton and his associates, to have betrayed and left Surrealism. Benjamin P\u00e9ret, Mary Low and Juan Bre\u00e1 joined the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification|POUM]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref name=\"Bauduin et al\" /><ref name=\"Spiteri\" />\n\nBreton's followers, along with the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]], were working for the \"liberation of man\". However, Breton's group refused to prioritize the [[proletarian]] struggle over radical creation such that their struggles with the Party made the late 1920s a turbulent time for both. Many individuals closely associated with Breton, notably Aragon, left his group to work more closely with the Communists.<ref name=\"Bauduin et al\" /><ref name=\"Spiteri\" />\n\nSurrealists have often sought to link their efforts with political ideals and activities. In the ''Declaration of January 27, 1925'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1925Surrealism.html |title=Modern History Sourcebook: A Surrealist Manifesto, 1925 |publisher=Fordham.edu |date=1925-01-27 |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> for example, members of the Paris-based [[Bureau of Surrealist Research]] (including Breton, Aragon and Artaud, as well as some two dozen others) declared their affinity for revolutionary politics. While this was initially a somewhat vague formulation, by the 1930s many Surrealists had strongly identified themselves with communism. The foremost document of this tendency within Surrealism is the ''Manifesto for a Free Revolutionary Art'',<ref>[http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcSurrealism1.html Generation-online.org]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref> published under the names of Breton and [[Diego Rivera]], but actually co-authored by Breton and [[Leon Trotsky]].<ref>Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1933 the Surrealists\u2019 assertion that a '[[proletarian literature]]' within a capitalist society was impossible led to their break with the Association des Ecrivains et Artistes R\u00e9volutionnaires, and the expulsion of Breton, \u00c9luard and Crevel from the Communist Party.<ref name=\"grove\"/>\n\nIn 1925, the Paris Surrealist group and the extreme left of the [[French Communist Party]] came together to support [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd-el-Krim]], leader of the [[Rif]] uprising against French colonialism in [[Morocco]]. In an open letter to writer and French ambassador to Japan, [[Paul Claudel]], the Paris group announced:\n\n:\"We Surrealists pronounced ourselves in favour of changing the imperialist war, in its chronic and colonial form, into a civil war. Thus we placed our energies at the disposal of the revolution, of the proletariat and its struggles, and defined our attitude towards the colonial problem, and hence towards the colour question.\"\n\nThe anticolonial revolutionary and proletarian politics of \"Murderous Humanitarianism\" (1932) which was drafted mainly by Crevel, signed by Breton, \u00c9luard, P\u00e9ret, Tanguy, and the Martiniquan Surrealists [[Pierre Yoyotte]] and [[J.M. Monnerot]] perhaps makes it the original document of what is later called 'black Surrealism',<ref>[[Robin Kelley|Kelley, Robin D.G.]] ''A Poetics of Anticolonialism''. November 1999.</ref> although it is the contact between [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] and Breton in the 1940s in [[Martinique]] that really lead to the communication of what is known as 'black Surrealism'.\n\nAnticolonial revolutionary writers in the [[N\u00e9gritude]] movement of [[Martinique]], a French colony at the time, took up Surrealism as a revolutionary method - a critique of European culture and a radical subjective. This linked with other Surrealists and was very important for the subsequent development of Surrealism as a revolutionary praxis. The journal ''[[Tropiques]]'', featuring the work of C\u00e9saire along with [[Suzanne C\u00e9saire]], [[Ren\u00e9 M\u00e9nil]], [[Lucie Th\u00e9s\u00e9e]], [[Aristide Maug\u00e9e]] and others, was first published in 1941.<ref>[[Robin Kelley|Kelley, Robin D.G.]] \"Poetry and the Political Imagination: Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, Negritude, & the Applications of Surrealism\". July 2001</ref>\n\nIn 1938 Andr\u00e9 Breton traveled with his wife, the painter [[Jacqueline Lamba]], to [[Mexico]] to meet Trotsky (staying as the guest of Diego Rivera's former wife Guadalupe Marin), and there he met [[Frida Kahlo]] and saw her paintings for the first time. Breton declared Kahlo to be an \"innate\" Surrealist painter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fridakahlofans.com/chronologyenglish.html |title=Frida Kahlo, Paintings, Chronology, Biography, Bio |publisher=Fridakahlofans.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref>\n\n===Internal politics===\nIn 1929 the satellite group associated with the journal ''Le Grand Jeu'', including [[Roger Gilbert-Lecomte]], [[Maurice Henry]] and the Czech painter [[Josef Sima]], was ostracized. Also in February, Breton asked Surrealists to assess their \"degree of moral competence\", and theoretical refinements included in the second ''[[Surrealist Manifesto|manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme]]'' excluded anyone reluctant to commit to collective action, a list which included Leiris, Limbour, Morise, Baron, Queneau, Pr\u00e9vert, Desnos, Masson and Boiffard. Excluded members launched a counterattack, sharply criticizing Breton in the pamphlet ''[[Un Cadavre]]'', which featured a picture of Breton wearing a [[crown of thorns]]. The pamphlet drew upon an earlier act of subversion by likening Breton to [[Anatole France]], whose unquestioned value Breton had challenged in 1924.n\n\nThe disunion of 1929-30 and the effects of ''Un Cadavre'' had very little negative impact upon Surrealism as Breton saw it, since core figures such as Aragon, Crevel, Dal\u00ed and Bu\u00f1uel remained true the idea of group action, at least for the time being. The success (or the controversy) of Dal\u00ed and Bu\u00f1uel's film [[L'Age d'Or]] in December 1930 had a regenerative effect, drawing a number of new recruits, and encouraging countless new artistic works the following year and throughout the 1930s.\n\nDisgruntled surrealists moved to the periodical ''[[Documents (magazine)|Documents]]'', edited by [[Georges Bataille]], whose anti-idealist materialism formed a hybrid Surrealism intending to expose the base instincts of humans.<ref name=\"grove\"/><ref name=\"pompidou\">[http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm Surrealist Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918070327/http://www.cnac-gp.fr/education/ressources/ENS-Surrealistart-EN/ENS-Surrealistart-EN.htm |date=2012-09-18 }} from [[Centre Pompidou]]. Retrieved March 20, 2007.</ref> To the dismay of many, ''Documents'' fizzled out in 1931, just as Surrealism seemed to be gathering more steam.\n\nThere were a number of reconciliations after this period of disunion, such as between Breton and Bataille, while Aragon left the group after committing himself to the [[French Communist Party]] in 1932. More members were ousted over the years for a variety of infractions, both political and personal, while others left in pursuit of their own style.\n\nBy the end of World War II the surrealist group led by Andr\u00e9 Breton decided to explicitly embrace anarchism. In 1952 Breton wrote \"It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself.\"<ref name=\"anarchosurrealism\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/history/1919-1950-the-politics-of-surrealism |title=1919-1950: The politics of Surrealism by Nick Heath |publisher=Libcom.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> \"Breton was consistent in his support for the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Anarchiste|francophone Anarchist Federation]] and he continued to offer his solidarity after the [[Platformism|Platformists]] supporting Fontenis transformed the FA into the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Communiste Libertaire. He was one of the few intellectuals who continued to offer his support to the FCL during the Algerian war when the FCL suffered severe repression and was forced underground. He sheltered Fontenis whilst he was in hiding. He refused to take sides on the splits in the French anarchist movement and both he and Peret expressed solidarity as well with the new [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration anarchiste]] set up by the synthesist anarchists and worked in the Antifascist Committees of the 60s alongside the FA.\"<ref name=\"anarchosurrealism\"/>\n\n==Golden age==\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:The Persistence of Memory.jpg|thumb|[[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'' (1931), [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[Manhattan]]]] -->\nThroughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in London]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Another English Surrealist group developed [[Birmingham Surrealists|in Birmingham]], meanwhile, and was distinguished by its opposition to the London surrealists and preferences for surrealism's French heartland. The two groups would reconcile later in the decade.\n\nDal\u00ed and Magritte created the most widely recognized images of the movement. Dal\u00ed joined the group in 1929, and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.\n\nSurrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth; stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, in order to evoke empathy from the viewer.\n\n1931 was a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: Magritte's ''Voice of Space (La Voix des airs)''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/2593?tmpl=component&print=1 |title=Surrealism - Magritte - Voice of Space |publisher=Guggenheim Collection |date= |access-date=2009-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319041151/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/2593?tmpl=component&print=1 |archive-date=2015-03-19 |df= }}</ref> is an example of this process, where three large spheres representing bells hang above a landscape. Another Surrealist landscape from this same year is Yves Tanguy's ''[[:File:Premontory Palace.jpg|Promontory Palace (Palais promontoire)]]'', with its molten forms and liquid shapes. Liquid shapes became the trademark of Dal\u00ed, particularly in his ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', which features the image of watches that sag as if they were melting.\n\nThe characteristics of this style\u2014a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological\u2014came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the [[modernism|modern]] period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be \"made whole with one's individuality\".\n\nBetween 1930 and 1933, the Surrealist Group in Paris issued the periodical ''[[Le Surr\u00e9alisme au service de la r\u00e9volution]]'' as the successor of ''La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste''.\n\nFrom 1936 through 1938 [[Wolfgang Paalen]], [[Gordon Onslow Ford]], and [[Roberto Matta]] joined the group. Paalen contributed [[Fumage]] and Onslow Ford [[Coulage]] as new pictorial automatic techniques.\n\nLong after personal, political and professional tensions fragmented the Surrealist group, Magritte and Dal\u00ed continued to define a visual program in the arts. This program reached beyond painting, to encompass photography as well, as can be seen from a Man Ray self-portrait, whose use of assemblage influenced [[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s collage boxes.\n[[File:L'Ange du Foyeur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Ernst]], ''L'Ange du Foyer ou le Triomphe du Surr\u00e9alisme'' (1937), private collection.]]\nDuring the 1930s [[Peggy Guggenheim]], an important American art collector, married Max Ernst and began promoting work by other Surrealists such as Yves Tanguy and the British artist [[John Tunnard]].\n\n'''Major exhibitions in the 1930s'''\n* 1936 - ''[[London International Surrealist Exhibition]]'' is organised in London by the art historian [[Herbert Read]], with an introduction by Andr\u00e9 Breton.\n* 1936 - [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York shows the exhibition ''[[Fantastic Art]], Dada and Surrealism''.\n* 1938 - A new ''[[Exposition Internationale du Surr\u00e9alisme]]'' was held at the Beaux-arts Gallery, Paris, with more than 60 artists from different countries, and showed around 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs and installations. The Surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act and called on Marcel Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray and others to do so. At the exhibition's entrance Salvador Dal\u00ed placed his [[Rainy Taxi]] (an old taxi rigged to produce a steady drizzle of water down the inside of the windows, and a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat and a blond mannequin crawling with live snails in the back) greeted the patrons who were in full evening dress. ''Surrealist Street'' filled one side of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various Surrealists. Paalen and Duchamp designed the main hall to seem like cave with 1,200 coal bags suspended from the ceiling over a coal brazier with a single light bulb which provided the only lighting, as well as the floor covered with humid leaves and mud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/interviews/hirschhorn/popup_8.html |title=Marcel Duchamp |publisher=Toutfait.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> The patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art. On the floor Wolfgang Paalen created a small lake with grasses and the aroma of roasting coffee filled the air. Much to the Surrealists' satisfaction the exhibition scandalized the viewers.<ref name=\"tomkins\"/>\n\n===World War II and the Post War period===\n[[File:Indefinite Divisibility.jpg|thumb|[[Yves Tanguy]] ''Indefinite Divisibility'' 1942, [[Albright Knox Art Gallery]], Buffalo, New York]]\nWorld War II created havoc not only for the general population of Europe but especially for the European artists and writers that opposed Fascism and Nazism. Many important artists fled to North America and relative safety in the United States. The art community in New York City in particular was already grappling with Surrealist ideas and several artists like [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Robert Motherwell]] converged closely with the surrealist artists themselves, albeit with some suspicion and reservations. Ideas concerning the unconscious and dream imagery were quickly embraced. By the Second World War, the taste of the American [[avant-garde]] in New York City swung decisively towards [[Abstract Expressionism]] with the support of key taste makers, including [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Leo Steinberg]] and [[Clement Greenberg]]. However, it should not be easily forgotten that Abstract Expressionism itself grew directly out of the meeting of American (particularly New York) artists with European Surrealists self-exiled during World War II. In particular, Gorky and Paalen influenced the development of this American art form, which, as Surrealism did, celebrated the instantaneous human act as the well-spring of creativity. The early work of many Abstract Expressionists reveals a tight bond between the more superficial aspects of both movements, and the emergence (at a later date) of aspects of [[Dadaist]]ic humor in such artists as [[Rauschenberg]] sheds an even starker light upon the connection. Up until the emergence of [[Pop Art]], Surrealism can be seen to have been the single most important influence on the sudden growth in American arts, and even in Pop, some of the humor manifested in Surrealism can be found, often turned to a cultural criticism.\n\nThe Second World War overshadowed, for a time, almost all intellectual and artistic production. In 1939 Wolfgang Paalen was the first to leave Paris for the New World as exile. After a long trip through the forests of British Columbia, he settled in Mexico and founded his influential art-magazine [[DYN (journal)|Dyn]]. In 1940 Yves Tanguy married American Surrealist painter [[Kay Sage]]. In 1941, Breton went to the United States, where he co-founded the short-lived magazine ''[[VVV (magazine)|VVV]]'' with Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, and the American artist [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]]. However, it was the American poet, [[Charles Henri Ford]], and his magazine ''[[View (magazine)|View]]'' which offered Breton a channel for promoting Surrealism in the United States. The ''View'' special issue on Duchamp was crucial for the public understanding of Surrealism in America. It stressed his connections to Surrealist methods, offered interpretations of his work by Breton, as well as Breton's view that Duchamp represented the bridge between early modern movements, such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] and [[Cubism]], to Surrealism. Wolfgang Paalen left the group in 1942 due to political/philosophical differences with Breton.\n\nThough the war proved disruptive for Surrealism, the works continued. Many Surrealist artists continued to explore their vocabularies, including Magritte. Many members of the Surrealist movement continued to correspond and meet. While Dal\u00ed may have been excommunicated by Breton, he neither abandoned his themes from the 1930s, including references to the \"persistence of time\" in a later painting, nor did he become a depictive pompier. His classic period did not represent so sharp a break with the past as some descriptions of his work might portray, and some, such as [[Andr\u00e9 Thirion]], argued that there were works of his after this period that continued to have some relevance for the movement.\n\nDuring the 1940s Surrealism's influence was also felt in England, America and the Netherlands where Gertrude Pape and her husband Theo van Baaren helped to popularize it in their publication The Clean Handkerchief.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Surrealist women : an international anthology|date=1998|publisher=University of Texas Press|others=Rosemont, Penelope.|isbn=978-0292770881|edition=1st|location=Austin|oclc=37782914|url=https://archive.org/details/surrealistwomeni00rose}}</ref> [[Mark Rothko]] took an interest in [[biomorphism|biomorphic]] figures, and in England [[Henry Moore]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] used or experimented with Surrealist techniques. However, [[Conroy Maddox]], one of the first British Surrealists whose work in this genre dated from 1935, remained within the movement, and organized an exhibition of current Surrealist work in 1978 in response to an earlier show which infuriated him because it did not properly represent Surrealism. Maddox's exhibition, titled ''Surrealism Unlimited'', was held in Paris and attracted international attention. He held his last one-man show in 2002, and died three years later.\nMagritte's work became more realistic in its depiction of actual objects, while maintaining the element of juxtaposition, such as in 1951's ''Personal Values (Les Valeurs Personnelles)''<ref>[http://www.sfmoma.org/MSoMA/newAWScreen.asp?awScreenNum=5139 SFmoma.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001014708/http://www.sfmoma.org/MSoMA/newAWScreen.asp?awScreenNum=5139 |date=October 1, 2008 }}</ref> and 1954's ''Empire of Light  (L\u2019Empire des lumi\u00e8res)''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/2594 |title=Artist - Magritte - Empire of Light - Large |publisher=Guggenheim Collection |date= January 1953|accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref> Magritte continued to produce works which have entered artistic vocabulary, such as ''Castle in the Pyrenees (Le Ch\u00e2teau des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es)'',<ref>[https://artacademieparis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/magritte_Castle-in-the-Pyrenees.jpg Artacademieparis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510184620/https://artacademieparis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/magritte_Castle-in-the-Pyrenees.jpg |date=2018-05-10 }}</ref> which refers back to ''Voix'' from 1931, in its suspension over a landscape.\n\nOther figures from the Surrealist movement were expelled. Several of these artists, like [[Roberto Matta]] (by his own description) \"remained close to Surrealism\".<ref name=\"tomkins\"/>\n\nAfter the crushing of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], [[Endre Rozsda]] returned to Paris to continue creating his own word that had been transcended the surrealism. The preface to his first exhibition in the Furstenberg Gallery (1957) was written by Breton yet.<ref name=\"breton\">Breton, Andr\u00e9. ''Surrealism and Painting'', Icon, 1973</ref>\n\nMany new artists explicitly took up the Surrealist banner. [[Dorothea Tanning]] and [[Louise Bourgeois]] continued to work, for example, with Tanning's ''Rainy Day Canape'' from 1970. Duchamp continued to produce sculpture in secret including an installation with the realistic depiction of a woman viewable only through a peephole.\n\nBreton continued to write and espouse the importance of liberating the human mind, as with the publication ''[[The Tower of Light]]'' in 1952. Breton's return to France after the War, began a new phase of Surrealist activity in Paris, and his critiques of rationalism and dualism found a new audience. Breton insisted that Surrealism was an ongoing revolt against the reduction of humanity to market relationships, religious gestures and misery and to espouse the importance of liberating the human mind.\n\n'''Major exhibitions of the 1940s, '50s and '60s'''\n* 1942 - ''First Papers of Surrealism'' - New York - The Surrealists again called on Duchamp to design an exhibition.

While [[Guy Debord]] was critical of and distanced himself from Surrealism, others, such as [[Asger Jorn]], were explicitly using Surrealist techniques and methods. [[May 1968 events in France|The events of May 1968]] in France included a number of Surrealist ideas, and among the slogans the students spray-painted on the walls of the Sorbonne were familiar Surrealist ones. [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] would commemorate this in a painting titled ''May 1968.'' There were also groups who associated with both currents and were more attached to Surrealism, such as the [[Revolutionary Surrealist Group]].\n\nDuring the 1980s, behind the [[Iron Curtain]], Surrealism again entered into politics with an underground artistic opposition movement known as the [[Orange Alternative]]. The Orange Alternative was created in 1981 by [[Waldemar Fydrych]] (alias 'Major'), a graduate of history and art history at the University of [[Wroc\u0142aw]]. They used Surrealist symbolism and terminology in their large scale happenings organized in the major Polish cities during the [[Jaruzelski]] regime, and painted Surrealist graffiti on spots covering up anti-regime slogans. Major himself was the author of a \"Manifesto of Socialist Surrealism\". In this manifesto, he stated that the socialist (communist) system had become so Surrealistic that it could be seen as an expression of art itself.\n\nSurrealistic art also remains popular with museum patrons. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City held an exhibit, ''Two Private Eyes'', in 1999, and in 2001 [[Tate Modern]] held an exhibition of Surrealist art that attracted over 170,000 visitors. In 2002 the [[Metropolitan Museum|Met]] in New York City held a show, ''Desire Unbound'', and the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris a show called ''La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste''.\n\nSurrealists groups and literary publications have continued to be active up to the present day, with groups such as the [[Chicago Surrealist Group]], the Leeds Surrealist Group, and the Surrealist Group of Stockholm. [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]] of the Czech-Slovak Surrealists continues to make films and experiment with objects.\n\n==Impact of Surrealism==\nWhile Surrealism is typically associated with the arts, it has impacted many other fields. In this sense, Surrealism does not specifically refer only to self-identified \"Surrealists\", or those sanctioned by Breton, rather, it refers to a range of creative acts of revolt and efforts to liberate imagination.<ref>Vaneigem, Raoul (Dupuis Jules-Fran\u00e7ois), ''Histoire d\u00e9sinvolte du surr\u00e9alisme''.

One might say that Surrealist strands may be found in movements such as [[Free Jazz]] ([[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Cecil Taylor]] etc.) and even in the daily lives of people in confrontation with limiting social conditions. Thought of as the effort of humanity to liberate imagination as an act of insurrection against society, Surrealism finds precedents in the [[alchemy|alchemists]], possibly [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Hieronymus Bosch]],<ref name=\"thecityreview1\">[http://www.thecityreview.com/surreal.html ''Surrealism:Two Private Eyes''].

This period is known as the [[Postmodern]] era; though there's no widely agreed upon central definition of [[Postmodernism]], many themes and techniques commonly identified as Postmodern are nearly identical to Surrealism.\n\nMany writers from and associated with the [[Beat Generation]] were influenced greatly by Surrealists.

Spike Jones Jr., whose father's orchestral recordings had a deep and indelible effect on me as a child, said once in an interview, 'One of the things that people don't realize about Dad's kind of music is, when you replace a C-sharp with a gunshot, it has to be a C-sharp gunshot or it sounds awful.'\"<ref name=\"PynchonSurralism\">[[Thomas Pynchon]] (1984) ''[[Slow Learner]]'', p.20</ref>\n\nMany other postmodern fiction writers have been directly influenced by Surrealism.

The original Paris Surrealist Group was disbanded by member Jean Schuster in 1969, but another Parisian surrealist group was later formed. The current Surrealist Group of Paris has recently published the first issue of their new journal, ''Alcheringa''. The Group of Czech-Slovak Surrealists never disbanded, and continue to publish their journal ''Analogon'', which now spans 80 volumes.\n\n===Surrealism and the theatre===\nSurrealist theatre and Artaud's \"Theatre of Cruelty\" were inspirational to many within the group of playwrights that the critic Martin Esslin called the \"[[Theatre of the Absurd]]\" (in his 1963 book of the same name). Though not an organized movement, Esslin grouped these playwrights together based on some similarities of theme and technique; Esslin argues that these similarities may be traced to an influence from the Surrealists. [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] in particular was fond of Surrealism, claiming at one point that Breton was one of the most important thinkers in history.<ref>Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco.

Many critics feel these works belong to [[fantastic art]] rather than having a significant connection with Surrealism.<ref>\"...the tendency to interpret Bosch's imagery in terms of modern Surrealism or Freudian psychology is anachronistic. We forget too often that Bosch never read Freud and that modern psychoanalysis would have been incomprehensible to the medieval mind... Modern psychology may explain the appeal Bosch's pictures have for us, but it cannot explain the meaning they had for Bosch and his contemporaries. Bosch did not intend to evoke the subconscious of the viewer, but to teach him certain moral and spiritual truths, and thus his images generally had a precise and premeditated significance.\" {{Cite book|title=Hieronymus Bosch, c. 1450-1516 : between heaven and hell|last=Bosing, Walter.|date=2000|publisher=Taschen|isbn=3822858560|location=London|oclc=45329900}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Avant-garde]]\n*[[Bizarre object|Bizarre Object]]\n*[[Dada]]\n* {{annotated link|Neo-Fauvism}}\n* {{annotated link|Organic Surrealism}}\n* {{annotated link|Outsider art}}\n* {{annotated link|Psychedelic art}}\n* {{annotated link|Sal\u00f3n de Mayo}} (Cuba)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''[[Andr\u00e9 Breton]]'''\n* ''Manifestoes of Surrealism'' containing the first, second and introduction to a possible third manifesto, the novel ''The Soluble Fish'', and political aspects of the Surrealist movement. {{ISBN|0-472-17900-4}} .\n* ''What is Surrealism?: Selected Writings of Andr\u00e9 Breton''. {{ISBN|0-87348-822-9}} .\n* ''Conversations: The Autobiography of Surrealism'' (Gallimard 1952) (Paragon House English rev. ed. 1993). {{ISBN|1-56924-970-9}}.\n* ''The Abridged Dictionary of Surrealism'', reprinted in:\n** Bonnet, Marguerite, ed.

Two of Robin's songs, \"Embrace\" and \"Promise The Earth\" are [[Europop]] dance songs, while Barry's \"Technicolor Dreams\" is an exception to the rule, as it is an homage to the typical 1930s [[Tin Pan Alley]] melody. Maurice Gibb provides lead vocals for two songs, \"Man in the Middle\" and \"Walking on Air\".<ref name=\":0\" /> In the United Kingdom, two bonus tracks were published, \"Just in Case\" and \"Promise the Earth\" as well as other countries issued the album with 14 tracks.<ref name=\"records\"/>\n\n===Recording===\nOne song in the album, \"Sacred Trust\" was recorded in early 1998 in [[Miami Beach]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/98.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1998 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=13 January 2014}}</ref> Around 1999, the Bee Gees recorded \"I Will Be There\" but only as a demo as they sent it to [[Tina Turner]] and she recorded it for her album ''[[Twenty Four Seven (Tina Turner album)|Twenty Four Seven]]'' that same year.

Also in 1999, three new Barry Gibb compositions \"Technicolor Dreams\", \"Loose Talk Costs Lives\" and \"Voice in the Wilderness\" were recorded as well as four new Maurice Gibb compositions, but only \"Walking on Air\" and \"Man in the Middle\" were released.

It was one of the first Bee Gees albums to be re-released on [[Reprise Records]] in 2006, when the brothers regained the rights to all of their recordings.\n\n==Background==\nThe album features main vocals from all three of the brothers, and employs a variety of musical styles. \"This Is Where I Came In\" recalls the rock/indie theme more commonly found on 1960s Bee Gees songs. \"She Keeps on Coming\" and \"Voice in the Wilderness\" have strong rock themes, while \"Sacred Trust\", \"Just in Case\" and \"Wedding Day\" continue the Bee Gees' trend for love songs. Two of Robin's songs, \"Embrace\" and \"Promise The Earth\" are [[Europop]] dance songs, while Barry's \"Technicolor Dreams\" is an exception to the rule, as it is an homage to the typical 1930s [[Tin Pan Alley]] melody. Maurice Gibb provides lead vocals for two songs, \"Man in the Middle\" and \"Walking on Air\". In the United Kingdom, two bonus tracks were published, \"Just in Case\" and \"Promise the Earth\" as well as other countries issued the album with 14 tracks.<ref name=\"records\"/>\n\n===Recording===\nOne song in the album, \"Sacred Trust\" was recorded in early 1998 in [[Miami Beach]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/98.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1998 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=13 January 2014}}</ref> Around 1999, the Bee Gees recorded \"I Will Be There\" but only as a demo as they sent it to [[Tina Turner]] and she recorded it for her album ''[[Twenty Four Seven (Tina Turner album)|Twenty Four Seven]]'' that same year. Maurice Gibb was busy producing songs for the band Luna Park. Also in 1999, three new Barry Gibb compositions \"Technicolor Dreams\", \"Loose Talk Costs Lives\" and \"Voice in the Wilderness\" were recorded as well as four new Maurice Gibb compositions, but only \"Walking on Air\" and \"Man in the Middle\" were released. Also in 1999, the new Robin Gibb composition, \"Embrace\" was recorded. In October that year, the group recorded \"Wedding Day\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/99.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1999 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=13 January

From its beginning as a sparsely populated trading port to its modern role as a cosmopolitan international financial centre of over seven million people, the territory has attracted refugees, immigrants and expatriates alike searching for a new life.\nCitizenship matters were complicated by the fact that [[British nationality law]] treated those born in Hong Kong as [[British subjects]] (although they did not enjoy full rights and citizenship), while the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) did not recognise Hong Kong Chinese as such. The main reason for this was that recognising these people as British was seen as a tacit acceptance of a series of historical treaties that the PRC labelled as \"unequal\", including the ones which ceded [[Hong Kong Island]], the [[Kowloon Peninsula]] and the [[New Territories]] to Britain. The British government, however, recognising the unique political situation of Hong Kong, granted 3.4 million Hong Kongers a new type of nationality known as [[British National (Overseas)]], which is established in accordance with the Hong Kong Act 1985. Among those 3.4 million people, there are many British Nationals (Overseas) who are eligible for full British citizenship.

Even today their influence is apparent in specific areas, such as the banks and the navy, as well as in certain social activities, such as [[Association football|football]], horse racing, and the custom of drinking tea.\n\nDuring the movement for [[independence]] (1818), it was mainly the British who formed the [[Chilean Navy]], under the command of [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]].\n\nBritish investment helped Chile become prosperous and British seamen helped the Chilean navy become a strong force in the South Pacific. Chile won two wars, the first against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation and the second, the [[War of the Pacific]], in 1878\u201379, against an alliance between [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]]. The liberal-socialist \"Revolution of 1891\" introduced political reforms modelled on British parliamentary practice and lawmaking.\n\nBritish immigrants were also important in the northern zone of the country during the [[saltpetre]] boom, in the ports of [[Iquique]] and [[Pisagua, Chile|Pisagua]]. The \"King of Saltpetre\", [[John Thomas North]], was the principal tycoon of nitrate mining. The British legacy is reflected in the streets of the historic district of the city of Iquique, with the foundation of various institutions, such as the [[Club Hipico de Santiago|Club H\u00edpico]] (Racing Club). Nevertheless, the British active presence came to an end with the saltpetre crisis during the 1930s.\n\nSome [[Scottish people|Scots]] settled in the country's more temperate regions, where the climate and the forested landscape with glaciers and islands may have reminded them of their homeland (the Highlands and Northern Scotland) while [[English Chilean|English]] and [[Welsh Chilean|Welsh]] made up the rest. The Irish immigrants, who were frequently confused with the British, arrived as [[merchants]], [[tradesmen]] and sailors, settling along with the British in the main trading cities and ports.\n\nAn important contingent of British (principally Welsh) immigrants arrived between 1914 and 1950, settling in the present-day region of [[Magallanes y la Ant\u00e1rtica Chilena Region|Magallanes]]. British families were established in other areas of the country, such as [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Coquimbo]], the [[Araucan\u00eda Region|Araucan\u00eda]], and [[Chilo\u00e9]].\n\nThe cultural legacy of the British in Chile is notable and has spread beyond the British Chilean community into society at large. Customs taken from the British include [[afternoon tea]] (called [[Tea|onces]] by Chileans), [[Association football|football]], [[rugby union]] and [[horse racing]].

From its beginning as a sparsely populated trading port to its modern role as a cosmopolitan international financial centre of over seven million people, the territory has attracted refugees, immigrants and expatriates alike searching for a new life.\nCitizenship matters were complicated by the fact that [[British nationality law]] treated those born in Hong Kong as [[British subjects]] (although they did not enjoy full rights and citizenship), while the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) did not recognise Hong Kong Chinese as such. The main reason for this was that recognising these people as British was seen as a tacit acceptance of a series of historical treaties that the PRC labelled as \"unequal\", including the ones which ceded [[Hong Kong Island]], the [[Kowloon Peninsula]] and the [[New Territories]] to Britain. The British government, however, recognising the unique political situation of Hong Kong, granted 3.4 million Hong Kongers a new type of nationality known as [[British National (Overseas)]], which is established in accordance with the Hong Kong Act 1985. Among those 3.4 million people, there are many British Nationals (Overseas) who are eligible for full British citizenship.

Even today their influence is apparent in specific areas, such as the banks and the navy, as well as in certain social activities, such as [[Association football|football]], horse racing, and the custom of drinking tea.\n\nDuring the movement for [[independence]] (1818), it was mainly the British who formed the [[Chilean Navy]], under the command of [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]].\n\nBritish investment helped Chile become prosperous and British seamen helped the Chilean navy become a strong force in the South Pacific. Chile won two wars, the first against the Peru-Bolivian Confederation and the second, the [[War of the Pacific]], in 1878\u201379, against an alliance between [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]]. The liberal-socialist \"Revolution of 1891\" introduced political reforms modelled on British parliamentary practice and lawmaking.\n\nBritish immigrants were also important in the northern zone of the country during the [[saltpetre]] boom, in the ports of [[Iquique]] and [[Pisagua, Chile|Pisagua]]. The \"King of Saltpetre\", [[John Thomas North]], was the principal tycoon of nitrate mining. The British legacy is reflected in the streets of the historic district of the city of Iquique, with the foundation of various institutions, such as the [[Club Hipico de Santiago|Club H\u00edpico]] (Racing Club). Nevertheless, the British active presence came to an end with the saltpetre crisis during the 1930s.\n\nSome [[Scottish people|Scots]] settled in the country's more temperate regions, where the climate and the forested landscape with glaciers and islands may have reminded them of their homeland (the Highlands and Northern Scotland) while [[English Chilean|English]] and [[Welsh Chilean|Welsh]] made up the rest. The Irish immigrants, who were frequently confused with the British, arrived as [[merchants]], [[tradesmen]] and sailors, settling along with the British in the main trading cities and ports.\n\nAn important contingent of British (principally Welsh) immigrants arrived between 1914 and 1950, settling in the present-day region of [[Magallanes y la Ant\u00e1rtica Chilena Region|Magallanes]]. British families were established in other areas of the country, such as [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Coquimbo]], the [[Araucan\u00eda Region|Araucan\u00eda]], and [[Chilo\u00e9]].\n\nThe cultural legacy of the British in Chile is notable and has spread beyond the British Chilean community into society at large. Customs taken from the British include [[afternoon tea]] (called [[Tea|onces]] by Chileans), [[Association football|football]], [[rugby union]] and [[horse racing]].

She had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the [[Lake District]], developing a love of landscape, flora, and fauna, all of which she closely observed and painted.\n\nPotter's study and watercolours of fungi led to her being widely respected in the field of [[mycology]]. In her thirties, Potter self-published the highly successful children's book ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit''. Following this, Potter began writing and illustrating children's books full-time.\n\nIn all, Potter wrote thirty books; the best known being her [[Beatrix Potter#Publications|twenty-three children's tales]]. With the proceeds from the books and a legacy from an aunt, in 1905 Potter bought [[Hill Top, Cumbria|Hill Top Farm]] in [[Near and Far Sawrey|Near Sawrey]], a village in the [[Lake District]] which at that time was in [[Lancashire]]. Over the following decades, she purchased additional farms to preserve the unique hill country landscape. In 1913, at the age of 47, she married William Heelis, a respected local solicitor from [[Hawkshead]]. Potter was also a prize-winning breeder of [[Herdwick sheep]] and a prosperous farmer keenly interested in land preservation. She continued to write and illustrate, and to design spin-off merchandise based on her children's books for British publisher Warne until the duties of land management and her diminishing eyesight made it difficult to continue.\n\nPotter died of [[pneumonia]] and [[heart disease]] on 22 December 1943 at her home in Near Sawrey at the age of 77, leaving almost all her property to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. She is credited with preserving much of the land that now constitutes the [[Lake District National Park]]. Potter's books continue to sell throughout the world in many languages with her stories being retold in songs, films, ballet, and animations, and her life depicted in a feature film and television film.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life ===\n[[File:Young Beatrix.jpg|thumb|left|Potter at fifteen years with her [[English Springer Spaniel|springer spaniel]], Spot]]\n\nPotter's paternal grandfather, [[Edmund Potter]], from [[Glossop]] in [[Derbyshire]], owned what was then the largest [[calico]] printing works in England, and later served as a Member of Parliament.<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 10\u201314</ref>\n\nBeatrix's father, Rupert William Potter (1832\u20131914), was educated at Manchester College by the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] philosopher [[James Martineau]].<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Tim|title=Mandrake-The Duchess of Cambridge is related to Beatrix Potter, who once gave the Middleton family her own original hand-painted illustrations|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/10980599/Kate-Middleton-is-related-to-Beatrix-Potter.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph | location=UK | page=8 | date=22 July 2014|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|last=Taylor\n|first=Judy\n|title=Beatrix Potter \u2013  Artist, Storyteller \n|url=http://www.e-reading.co.uk/bookreader.php/1007152/Taylor_-_Beatrix_Potter_Artist,_Storyteller_and_Countrywoman.html\n|publisher=Frederick Warne, 1996\n|accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> He then trained as a barrister in London.

Her parents were artistic, interested in nature, and enjoyed the countryside. As children, Beatrix and Bertram had numerous small animals as pets which they observed closely and drew endlessly. In their schoolroom, Beatrix and Bertram kept a variety of small pets, mice, rabbits, a hedgehog and some bats, along with collections of butterflies and other insects which they drew and studied.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 31, pp. 37\u201344, p. 458nn15</ref> Beatrix was devoted to the care of her small animals, often taking them with her on long holidays.<ref>Judy Taylor, Joyce Irene Whalley, Anne Stevenson Hobbs and Elizabeth Battrick, (1987) ''Beatrix Potter, 1866\u20131943: The Artist and Her World'', pp.9\u201317, 35\u201348; Lear, pp. 25\u201348.</ref> In most of the first fifteen years of her life, Beatrix spent summer holidays at [[Dalguise]], an estate on the [[River Tay]] in Perthshire, Scotland. There she sketched and explored an area that nourished her imagination and her observation.<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 26\u20138, 51</ref> Beatrix and her brother were allowed great freedom in the country, and both children became adept students of [[natural history]]. In 1882, when Dalguise was no longer available, the Potters took their first summer holiday in the [[Lake District]], at [[Wray Castle]] near [[Windermere|Lake Windermere]].<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 51\u20132</ref> Here Beatrix met [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], vicar of Wray and later the founding secretary of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], whose interest in the countryside and country life inspired the same in Beatrix and who was to have a lasting impact on her life.<ref>Potter, ''The Journal, 1885\u20131897''</ref><ref>Lear 2007, pp. 52\u20133</ref>\n\nAt about the age of 14, Beatrix began to keep a diary. It was written in a code of her own devising which was a simple letter for letter [[Substitution cipher|substitution]]. Her ''Journal'' was important to the development of her creativity, serving as both sketchbook and literary experiment: in tiny handwriting, she reported on society, recorded her impressions of art and artists, recounted stories and observed life around her.<ref>Lear 2007, pp.49\u201351 ''cf.'' also p. 463nn1</ref> The ''Journal'', decoded and transcribed by Leslie Linder in 1958, does not provide an intimate record of her personal life, but it is an invaluable source for understanding a vibrant part of British society in the late 19th century. It describes Potter's maturing artistic and intellectual interests, her often amusing insights on the places she visited, and her unusual ability to observe nature and to describe it. Started in 1881, her journal ends in 1897 when her artistic and intellectual energies were absorbed in scientific study and in efforts to publish her drawings.<ref>Potter, \"The Journal, 1885\u20131897\"</ref> Precocious but reserved and often bored, she was searching for more independent activities and wished to earn some money of her own while dutifully taking care of her parents, dealing with her especially demanding mother,<ref>Lear 2007, p. 94 also ''cf.'' p. 474nn55</ref> and managing their various households.\n\n===Scientific illustrations and work in mycology===\n[[File:Beatrix Potter- Mycology. Source- Armitt Museum and Library.jpg|thumb|Beatrix Potter: reproductive system of [[Hygrocybe coccinea]], 1897.]]\nBeatrix Potter's parents did not discourage higher education. As was common in the [[Victorian era]], women of her class were privately educated and rarely went to university.<ref>Taylor, ''Artist, Storyteller'', pp. 59\u201361; Elizabeth E. Battrick, (1999) ''Beatrix Potter: The Unknown Years''; Lynn Barber, (1980) ''The Heyday of Natural History'', Brian Gardiner, \"Breatrix Potter\u2019s Fossils and Her Interests in Geology\", The Linnean, 16/1 (January 2000), 31\u201347; Lear 2007, pp. 76\u2013103; Potter, ''Journal, 1891\u20131897''.</ref>\n\nBeatrix Potter was interested in every branch of natural science save [[astronomy]].<ref>Lear 2007, p. 98</ref> [[Botany]] was a passion for most [[Victorians]] and nature study was a popular enthusiasm. Potter was eclectic in her tastes: collecting fossils,<ref>Brian G. Gardiner, \"Beatrix Potter's fossils and her interest in Geology,\" ''The Linnean: Newsletter and Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London'' 16/1 (January 2000), pp. 31\u201347</ref> studying [[archeology|archaeological]] artefacts from London excavations, and interested in [[entomology]]. In all these areas, she drew and painted her specimens with increasing skill. By the 1890s, her scientific interests centred on [[mycology]]. First drawn to fungi because of their colours and evanescence in nature and her delight in painting them, her interest deepened after meeting Charles McIntosh, a revered naturalist and amateur mycologist, during a summer holiday in Dunkeld in [[Perthshire]] in 1892. He helped improve the accuracy of her illustrations, taught her [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and supplied her with live specimens to paint during the winter. Curious as to how fungi reproduced, Potter began microscopic drawings of fungus spores (the [[agaric]]s) and in 1895 developed a theory of their [[germination]].<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 81\u2013103</ref> Through the connections of her uncle [[Henry Enfield Roscoe|Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe]], a chemist and [[vice-chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]] of the [[University of London]], she consulted with botanists at [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew Gardens]], convincing [[George Edward Massee|George Massee]] of her ability to germinate spores and her theory of [[F1 hybrid|hybridisation]].<ref>Lear 2007, p. 117</ref> She did not believe in the theory of [[symbiosis]] proposed by [[Simon Schwendener]], the German mycologist, as previously thought; instead, she proposed a more independent process of reproduction.<ref>M.A. Taylor and R.H.

It was introduced by Massee because, as a female, Potter could not attend proceedings or read her paper. She subsequently withdrew it, realising that some of her samples were contaminated, but continued her microscopic studies for several more years. Her paper has only recently been rediscovered, along with the rich, artistic illustrations and drawings that accompanied it. Her work is only now being properly evaluated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beatrix Potter and the Linnean Society|url=http://www.linnean.org/index.php?id=104|publisher=Linnean Society|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref><ref>Lear 2007, pp. 104\u201325</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Publications/The-Linnaen/Lin%20Vol%2016_%20no%201_%20Jan%202000.pdf |last=Watling |first=Roy |title=Helen Beatrix Potter: Her interest in fungi |work=The Linnean: Newsletter and Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London |volume=16 |issue=1 |date=January 2000 |pages=24\u201331 |authorlink=Roy Watling |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513210936/https://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Publications/The-Linnaen/Lin%20Vol%2016_%20no%201_%20Jan%202000.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2013  }}</ref> Potter later gave her other mycological and scientific drawings to the [[Armitt Library|Armitt Museum and Library]] in Ambleside, where mycologists still refer to them to identify fungi. There is also a collection of her fungus paintings at the [[Perth Museum and Art Gallery]] in Perth, Scotland, donated by Charles McIntosh. In 1967, the mycologist [[Walter Philip Kennedy Findlay|W.P.K. Findlay]] included many of Potter's beautifully accurate fungus drawings in his ''Wayside & Woodland Fungi'', thereby fulfilling her desire to one day have her fungus drawings published in a book.<ref>Walter Philip Kennedy Findlay, (1967) ''Wayside & Woodland Fungi''</ref> In 1997, the Linnean Society issued a posthumous apology to Potter for the sexism displayed in its handling of her research.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 125, p.482nn58</ref>\n\n===Artistic and literary career===\n[[File:Peter Rabbit first edition 1902a.jpg|thumb|upright|First edition, 1902]]\nPotter's artistic and literary interests were deeply influenced by fairies, fairy tales and fantasy. She was a student of the classic fairy tales of Western Europe. As well as stories from the [[Old Testament]], [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', she grew up with ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'', the fairy tales of the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|The Water Babies]]'',<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 30\u20131</ref> the folk tales and [[Scottish mythology|mythology of Scotland]], the [[German Romanticism|German Romantics]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],<ref>Lear 2007, p. 95. She liked to memorise his plays by heart.</ref> and the romances of [[Sir Walter Scott]].<ref>Lear 2007, p. 35. Beatrix said she learnt to read \"on\" Scott</ref> As a young child, before the age of eight, [[Edward Lear]]'s ''Book of Nonsense'', including the much loved ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]'', and [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' had made their impression, although she later said of ''Alice'' that she was more interested in [[John Tenniel|Tenniel]]'s illustrations than what they were about.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 34</ref> The ''[[Brer Rabbit]]'' stories of [[Joel Chandler Harris]] had been family favourites, and she later studied his ''[[Uncle Remus]]'' stories and illustrated them.<ref>Lear 2007, p.131. She began eight ''Uncle Remus'' drawings in the same year 1893 she began writing the ''Peter Rabbit'' picture letters to Noel Moore, completing the last in 1896.</ref> She studied book illustration from a young age and developed her own tastes, but the work of the picture book triumvirate [[Walter Crane]], [[Kate Greenaway]] and [[Randolph Caldecott]], the last an illustrator whose work was later collected by her father, was a great influence.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 33</ref> When she started to illustrate, she chose first the traditional rhymes and stories, \"[[Cinderella]]\", \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\", \"[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]\", \"[[Puss in Boots|Puss-in-boots]]\", and \"[[Red Riding Hood]]\".<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 127\u20138</ref> However, most often her illustrations were fantasies featuring her own pets: mice, rabbits, kittens, and guinea pigs.<ref>Taylor, et al., ''The Artist and her World,'' pp. 49\u201370;  Potter, ''Journal, 1884\u20131897''; Humphrey Carpenter (1985), ''Secret Gardens: The Golden Age of Children\u2019s Literature.''</ref>\n\nIn her teenage years, Potter was a regular visitor to the art galleries of London, particularly enjoying the summer and winter exhibitions at the [[Royal Academy]] in London.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 47-8. [[J. M. W. Turner]] was the first artist to impress her.</ref> Her ''Journal'' reveals her growing sophistication as a critic as well as the influence of her father's friend, the artist [[Sir John Everett Millais]], who recognised Beatrix's talent of observation. Although Potter was aware of art and artistic trends, her drawing and her prose style were uniquely her own.<ref>Taylor, ''Artist, Storyteller,'' pp. 70\u201395; Taylor, ed. 1989, ''Beatrix Potters Letters''.</ref>\n\nAs a way to earn money in the 1890s, Beatrix and her brother began to print Christmas cards of their own design, as well as cards for special occasions. Mice and rabbits were the most frequent subject of her fantasy paintings. In 1890, the firm of Hildesheimer and Faulkner bought several of the drawings of her rabbit [[Benjamin Bunny]] to illustrate verses by [[Frederic Weatherly]] titled ''A Happy Pair''. In 1893, the same printer bought several more drawings for Weatherly's ''Our Dear Relations'', another book of rhymes, and the following year Potter sold a series of frog illustrations and verses for ''Changing Pictures'', a popular annual offered by the art publisher Ernest Nister. Potter was pleased by this success and determined to publish her own illustrated stories.<ref>Taylor, et al. 1987, pp. 107\u2013148; Katherine Chandler, \"Thoroughly Post-Victorian, Pre-Modern Beatrix.\" ''Children's Literature Quarterly''. 32(4): 287\u2013307.</ref>\n\nWhenever Potter went on holiday to the [[Lake District]] or [[Scotland]], she sent letters to young friends, illustrating them with quick sketches. Many of these letters were written to the children of her former governess Annie Carter Moore, particularly to Moore's eldest son Noel who was often ill. In September 1893, Potter was on holiday at Eastwood in [[Dunkeld]], Perthshire. She had run out of things to say to Noel, and so she told him a story about \"four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter\". It became one of the most famous children's letters ever written and the basis of Potter's future career as a writer-artist-storyteller.<ref>Judy Taylor 1992, ''Letters to Children from Beatrix Potter''.</ref>\n[[File:Beatrix Potter dummy manuscripts.jpg|thumb|left|Potter's dummy manuscripts of three of her books \u2013 designed to see how the printed book would look]]\nIn 1900, Potter revised her tale about the four little rabbits, and fashioned a dummy book of it \u2013 it has been suggested, in imitation of [[Helen Bannerman]]'s 1899 bestseller ''[[The Story of Little Black Sambo]]''.<ref>Stevenson, Laura C. \"A Vogue for Small Books\": The Tale of Peter Rabbit and its Contemporary Competitors\" [http://www.lauracstevenson.org/avogueoflittlebooks.htm]</ref> Unable to find a buyer for the work, she published it for family and friends at her own expense in December 1901. It was drawn in black and white with a coloured frontispiece. Rawnsley had great faith in Potter's tale, recast it in didactic verse, and made the rounds of the London publishing houses. [[Frederick Warne & Co]] had previously rejected the tale but, eager to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted the \"bunny book\" (as the firm called it) following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist [[L. Leslie Brooke]].<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 144\u20137</ref> The firm declined Rawnsley's verse in favour of Potter's original prose, and Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations, choosing the then-new [[Edmund Evans#Later work and retirement|Hentschel three-colour process]] to reproduce her watercolours.<ref name=\"Hobbs15\">Hobbs 1989, p. 15</ref>\n[[File:Tower Bank Arms.jpg|thumb|right|Potter used many real locations for her book illustrations. The Tower Bank Arms, Near Sawrey appears in ''The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck''.]]\nOn 2 October 1902, ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' was published,<ref>Taylor 1996, p. 76</ref> and was an immediate success. It was followed the next year by ''[[The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin]]'' and ''[[The Tailor of Gloucester]]'', which had also first been written as picture letters to the Moore children. Working with [[Norman Warne]] as her editor, Potter published two or three little books each year: 23 books in all. The last book in this format was ''[[Cecily Parsley's Nursery Rhymes]]'' in 1922, a collection of favourite rhymes. Although ''[[The Tale of Little Pig Robinson]]'' was not published until 1930, it had been written much earlier. Potter continued creating her little books until after the [[First World War]] when her energies were increasingly directed toward her farming, sheep-breeding and land conservation.<ref>Judy Taylor 2002, ''That Naughty Rabbit: Beatrix Potter and Peter Rabbit'';  Lear 2007, pp. 207\u2013247; Anne Stevenson Hobbs, ed. 1989, ''Beatrix Potter\u2019s Art: Paintings and Drawings''.</ref>\n\nThe immense popularity of Potter's books was based on the lively quality of her illustrations, the non-didactic nature of her stories, the depiction of the rural countryside, and the imaginative qualities she lent to her animal characters.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qdVTAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA165|last=Kutzer|first=M.

As early as 1903, she made and patented a [[Peter Rabbit]] doll. It was followed by other \"spin-off\" merchandise over the years, including painting books, board games, wall-paper, figurines, baby blankets and china tea-sets. All were licensed by [[Frederick Warne & Co]] and earned Potter an independent income, as well as immense profits for her publisher.<ref>See Judy Taylor 2002, \"That Naughty Rabbit\"</ref>\n\nIn 1905, Potter and [[Norman Warne]] became unofficially engaged. Potter's parents objected to the match because Warne was \"in trade\" and thus not socially suitable. The engagement lasted only one month until Warne died of [[pernicious anaemia]] at age 37.<ref>Lear 2007, pp.198- 201</ref> That same year, Potter used some of her income and a small inheritance from an aunt to buy [[Hill Top Farm]] in [[Near Sawrey]] in the English [[Lake District]] near Windermere. Potter and Warne may have hoped that Hill Top Farm would be their holiday home, but after Warne's death, Potter went ahead with its purchase as she had always wanted to own that farm, and live in \"that charming village\".<ref>Lear 2007, p. 207</ref>\n\n===Country life===\n[[File:Hill Top Farm.jpg|thumb|right|Hill Top, Near Sawrey&nbsp;\u2013 Potter's former home, now owned by the National Trust and preserved as it was when she lived and wrote her stories there.]]\nThe tenant farmer John Cannon and his family agreed to stay on to manage the farm for her while she made physical improvements and learned the techniques of [[fell farming]] and of raising livestock, including pigs, cows and chickens; the following year she added sheep. Realising she needed to protect her boundaries, she sought advice from W.H. Heelis & Son, a local firm of solicitors with offices in nearby [[Hawkshead]]. With William Heelis acting for her, she bought contiguous pasture, and in 1909 the {{convert|20|acre|ha}} Castle Farm across the road from Hill Top Farm. She visited Hill Top at every opportunity, and her books written during this period (such as ''[[The Tale of Ginger and Pickles]]'', about the local shop in Near Sawrey and ''[[The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse]]'', a wood mouse) reflect her increasing participation in village life and her delight in country living.<ref>Taylor, ed., (2002) ''Beatrix Potter's Letters''; Hunter Davies, ''Beatrix Potter's Lakeland''; W.R. Mitchell, ''Potter: Her Life in the Lake District''.</ref>\n\nOwning and managing these working farms required routine collaboration with the widely respected William Heelis. By the summer of 1912, Heelis had proposed marriage and Beatrix had accepted; although she did not immediately tell her parents, who once again disapproved because Heelis was only a country solicitor. Potter and Heelis were married on 15 October 1913 in London at [[St Mary Abbots]] in [[Kensington]]. The couple moved immediately to [[Near and Far Sawrey|Near Sawrey]], residing at Castle Cottage, the renovated farmhouse on Castle Farm, which was 34 acres large. Hill Top remained a working farm but was now remodelled to allow for the tenant family and Potter's private studio and workshop. At last her own woman, Potter settled into the partnerships that shaped the rest of her life: her country solicitor husband and his large family, her farms, the Sawrey community and the predictable rounds of country life. ''[[The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Tom Kitten]]'' are representative of Hill Top Farm and her farming life and reflect her happiness with her country life.<ref>John Heelis, (1999) ''The Tale of Mrs William Heelis&nbsp;\u2013 Beatrix Potter''; Lear, Ch. 13.</ref>\n\nRupert Potter died in 1914 and, with the outbreak of [[World War I]], Potter, now a wealthy woman, persuaded her mother to move to the Lake District and found a property for her to rent in Sawrey. Finding life in Sawrey dull, Helen Potter soon moved to Lindeth Howe (now a 34 bedroomed hotel) a large house the Potters had previously rented for the summer in [[Bowness-on-Windermere|Bowness]], on the other side of Lake Windermere,<ref>{{cite book|last= McDowell|first= Marta|title=Beatrix Potter's Gardening Life: The Plants and Places That Inspired the classic children's tales|publisher=Timber Press|date=2013|pages=116|isbn=1604693630}}</ref> Potter continued to write stories for Frederick Warne & Co and fully participated in country life. She established a Nursing Trust for local villages and served on various committees and councils responsible for footpaths and other rural issues.<ref>Taylor et al. ''The Artist and Her World'', pp. 185\u2013194; Taylor, ''Artist Storyteller'', pp. 105\u2013144.</ref>\n\n===Sheep farming===\nSoon after acquiring Hill Top Farm, Potter became keenly interested in the breeding and raising of [[Herdwick|Herdwick sheep]], the indigenous fell sheep. In 1923 she bought a large sheep farm in the Troutbeck Valley called [[Troutbeck Park|Troutbeck Park Farm]], formerly a deer park, restoring its land with thousands of Herdwick sheep. This established her as one of the major Herdwick sheep farmers in the county. She was admired by her shepherds and farm managers for her willingness to experiment with the latest biological remedies for the common diseases of sheep, and for her employment of the best shepherds, sheep breeders, and farm managers.<ref>William Rollinson, (1981) ''How They Lived in the Lake District''; Susan Denyer, 1993 ''Herdwick Sheep Farming''; Geoff Brown, (2009) ''Herdwicks: Herdwick Sheep and the English Lake District''; Judy Taylor, ed., (1998) ''Beatrix Potter\u2019s Farming Friendship. Lake District Letters to Joseph Moscrop, 1926\u20131943''.</ref>\n\nBy the late 1920s, Potter and her Hill Top farm manager Tom Storey had made a name for their prize-winning Herdwick flock, which took many prizes at the local agricultural shows, where Potter was often asked to serve as a judge. In 1942 she became President-elect of the Herdwick Sheepbreeders\u2019 Association, the first time a woman had been elected but died before taking office.<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 381\u2013404</ref>\n\n==Lake District conservation==\n{{no reference|section|date=July 2019}}\nPotter had been a disciple of the land conservation and preservation ideals of her long-time friend and mentor, [[Hardwicke Rawnsley|Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley]], the first secretary and founding member of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]]. She supported the efforts of the National Trust to preserve not just the places of extraordinary beauty but also those heads of valleys and low grazing lands that would be irreparably ruined by development. Potter was also an authority on the traditional Lakeland crafts, period furniture and stonework. She restored and preserved the farms that she bought or managed, making sure that each farm house had in it a piece of antique Lakeland furniture. Potter was interested in preserving not only the [[Herdwick sheep]] but also the way of life of fell farming. In 1930 the Heelises became partners with the National Trust in buying and managing the fell farms included in the large Monk Coniston Estate. The estate was composed of many farms spread over a wide area of north-western Lancashire, including the [[Tarn Hows]]. Potter was the ''de facto'' estate manager for the Trust for seven years until the National Trust could afford to repurchase most of the property from her. Potter's stewardship of these farms earned her full regard, but she was not without her critics, not the least of which were her contemporaries who felt she used her wealth and the position of her husband to acquire properties in advance of their being made public. She was notable in observing the problems of [[afforestation]], preserving the intake grazing lands, and husbanding the quarries and timber on these farms. All her farms were stocked with Herdwick sheep and frequently with [[Galloway cattle]].\n[[File:Derwent Water, Lake District, Cumbria - June 2009.jpg|thumb|Lake District]]\n\n==Later life==\nPotter continued to write stories and to draw, although mostly for her own pleasure. Her books in the late 1920s included the semi-autobiographical ''[[The Fairy Caravan]]'', a fanciful tale set in her beloved [[Troutbeck Tongue|Troutbeck fells]]. It was published only in the US during Potter's lifetime, and not until 1952 in the UK. ''Sister Anne'', Potter's version of the story of [[Bluebeard]], was written for her American readers, but illustrated by Katharine Sturges. A final folktale, ''Wag by Wall'', was published posthumously by ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'' in 1944. Potter was a generous patron of the [[Girl Guides]], whose troupes she allowed to make their summer encampments on her land, and whose company she enjoyed as an older woman.<ref>Jane Morse, ed., (1982) ''Beatrix Potter's Americans: Selected Letters''; Susan Denyer, (2000) ''At Home with Beatrix Potter: The Creator of Peter Rabbit''.</ref>\n\nPotter and William Heelis enjoyed a happy marriage of thirty years, continuing their farming and preservation efforts throughout the hard days of [[World War II]]. Although they were childless, Potter played an important role in William's large family, particularly enjoying her relationship with several nieces whom she helped educate, and giving comfort and aid to her husband's brothers and sisters.<ref>Heelis, ''Mrs. William Heelis''; Taylor, ed., ''Beatrix Potter's Letters''.</ref>\n\nPotter died of complications from [[pneumonia]] and [[heart disease]] on 22 December 1943 at Castle Cottage, and her remains were cremated at [[Carleton Crematorium and Cemetery|Carleton Crematorium]]. She left nearly all her property to the National Trust, including over {{convert|4000|acre|km2}} of land, sixteen farms, cottages and herds of cattle and Herdwick sheep. Hers was the largest gift at that time to the National Trust, and it enabled the preservation of the land now included in the [[Lake District National Park]] and the continuation of fell farming. The central office of the National Trust in [[Swindon]] was named \"Heelis\" in 2005 in her memory. William Heelis continued his stewardship of their properties and of her literary and artistic work for the twenty months he survived her. When he died in August 1945, he left the remainder to the National Trust.<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 405\u2013440; Taylor, ed., ''Beatrix Potter's Letters''; Taylor, et al., ''The Artist and Her World''.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Goody and Mrs. Hackee.jpg|thumb|left|Goody and Mrs. Hackee, illustration to ''The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes'', 1911]]\nPotter left almost all the original illustrations for her books to the National Trust. The copyright to her stories and merchandise was then given to her publisher Frederick Warne & Co, now a division of the [[Penguin Group]]. On 1 January 2014, the copyright expired in the UK and other countries with a 70-years-after-death limit. Hill Top Farm was opened to the public by the National Trust in 1946; her artwork was displayed there until 1985 when it was moved to William Heelis's former law offices in [[Hawkshead]], also owned by the National Trust as the [[Beatrix Potter Gallery]].<ref>Bruce L.

She had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the [[Lake District]], developing a love of landscape, flora, and fauna, all of which she closely observed and painted.\n\nPotter's study and watercolours of fungi led to her being widely respected in the field of [[mycology]]. In her thirties, Potter self-published the highly successful children's book ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit''. Following this, Potter began writing and illustrating children's books full-time.\n\nIn all, Potter wrote thirty books; the best known being her [[Beatrix Potter#Publications|twenty-three children's tales]]. With the proceeds from the books and a legacy from an aunt, in 1905 Potter bought [[Hill Top, Cumbria|Hill Top Farm]] in [[Near and Far Sawrey|Near Sawrey]], a village in the [[Lake District]] which at that time was in [[Lancashire]]. Over the following decades, she purchased additional farms to preserve the unique hill country landscape. In 1913, at the age of 47, she married William Heelis, a respected local solicitor from [[Hawkshead]]. Potter was also a prize-winning breeder of [[Herdwick sheep]] and a prosperous farmer keenly interested in land preservation. She continued to write and illustrate, and to design spin-off merchandise based on her children's books for British publisher Warne until the duties of land management and her diminishing eyesight made it difficult to continue.\n\nPotter died of [[pneumonia]] and [[heart disease]] on 22 December 1943 at her home in Near Sawrey at the age of 77, leaving almost all her property to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. She is credited with preserving much of the land that now constitutes the [[Lake District National Park]]. Potter's books continue to sell throughout the world in many languages with her stories being retold in songs, films, ballet, and animations, and her life depicted in a feature film and television film.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life ===\n[[File:Young Beatrix.jpg|thumb|left|Potter at fifteen years with her [[English Springer Spaniel|springer spaniel]], Spot]]\n\nPotter's paternal grandfather, [[Edmund Potter]], from [[Glossop]] in [[Derbyshire]], owned what was then the largest [[calico]] printing works in England, and later served as a Member of Parliament.<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 10\u201314</ref>\n\nBeatrix's father, Rupert William Potter (1832\u20131914), was educated at Manchester College by the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] philosopher [[James Martineau]].<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Tim|title=Mandrake-The Duchess of Cambridge is related to Beatrix Potter, who once gave the Middleton family her own original hand-painted illustrations|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/10980599/Kate-Middleton-is-related-to-Beatrix-Potter.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph | location=UK | page=8 | date=22 July 2014|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|last=Taylor\n|first=Judy\n|title=Beatrix Potter \u2013  Artist, Storyteller \n|url=http://www.e-reading.co.uk/bookreader.php/1007152/Taylor_-_Beatrix_Potter_Artist,_Storyteller_and_Countrywoman.html\n|publisher=Frederick Warne, 1996\n|accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> He then trained as a barrister in London.

Her parents were artistic, interested in nature, and enjoyed the countryside. As children, Beatrix and Bertram had numerous small animals as pets which they observed closely and drew endlessly. In their schoolroom, Beatrix and Bertram kept a variety of small pets, mice, rabbits, a hedgehog and some bats, along with collections of butterflies and other insects which they drew and studied.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 31, pp. 37\u201344, p. 458nn15</ref> Beatrix was devoted to the care of her small animals, often taking them with her on long holidays.<ref>Judy Taylor, Joyce Irene Whalley, Anne Stevenson Hobbs and Elizabeth Battrick, (1987) ''Beatrix Potter, 1866\u20131943: The Artist and Her World'', pp.9\u201317, 35\u201348; Lear, pp. 25\u201348.</ref> In most of the first fifteen years of her life, Beatrix spent summer holidays at [[Dalguise]], an estate on the [[River Tay]] in Perthshire, Scotland. There she sketched and explored an area that nourished her imagination and her observation.<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 26\u20138, 51</ref> Beatrix and her brother were allowed great freedom in the country, and both children became adept students of [[natural history]]. In 1882, when Dalguise was no longer available, the Potters took their first summer holiday in the [[Lake District]], at [[Wray Castle]] near [[Windermere|Lake Windermere]].<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 51\u20132</ref> Here Beatrix met [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], vicar of Wray and later the founding secretary of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], whose interest in the countryside and country life inspired the same in Beatrix and who was to have a lasting impact on her life.<ref>Potter, ''The Journal, 1885\u20131897''</ref><ref>Lear 2007, pp. 52\u20133</ref>\n\nAt about the age of 14, Beatrix began to keep a diary. It was written in a code of her own devising which was a simple letter for letter [[Substitution cipher|substitution]]. Her ''Journal'' was important to the development of her creativity, serving as both sketchbook and literary experiment: in tiny handwriting, she reported on society, recorded her impressions of art and artists, recounted stories and observed life around her.<ref>Lear 2007, pp.49\u201351 ''cf.'' also p. 463nn1</ref> The ''Journal'', decoded and transcribed by Leslie Linder in 1958, does not provide an intimate record of her personal life, but it is an invaluable source for understanding a vibrant part of British society in the late 19th century. It describes Potter's maturing artistic and intellectual interests, her often amusing insights on the places she visited, and her unusual ability to observe nature and to describe it. Started in 1881, her journal ends in 1897 when her artistic and intellectual energies were absorbed in scientific study and in efforts to publish her drawings.<ref>Potter, \"The Journal, 1885\u20131897\"</ref> Precocious but reserved and often bored, she was searching for more independent activities and wished to earn some money of her own while dutifully taking care of her parents, dealing with her especially demanding mother,<ref>Lear 2007, p. 94 also ''cf.'' p. 474nn55</ref> and managing their various households.\n\n===Scientific illustrations and work in mycology===\n[[File:Beatrix Potter- Mycology. Source- Armitt Museum and Library.jpg|thumb|Beatrix Potter: reproductive system of [[Hygrocybe coccinea]], 1897.]]\nBeatrix Potter's parents did not discourage higher education. As was common in the [[Victorian era]], women of her class were privately educated and rarely went to university.<ref>Taylor, ''Artist, Storyteller'', pp. 59\u201361; Elizabeth E. Battrick, (1999) ''Beatrix Potter: The Unknown Years''; Lynn Barber, (1980) ''The Heyday of Natural History'', Brian Gardiner, \"Breatrix Potter\u2019s Fossils and Her Interests in Geology\", The Linnean, 16/1 (January 2000), 31\u201347; Lear 2007, pp. 76\u2013103; Potter, ''Journal, 1891\u20131897''.</ref>\n\nBeatrix Potter was interested in every branch of natural science save [[astronomy]].<ref>Lear 2007, p. 98</ref> [[Botany]] was a passion for most [[Victorians]] and nature study was a popular enthusiasm. Potter was eclectic in her tastes: collecting fossils,<ref>Brian G. Gardiner, \"Beatrix Potter's fossils and her interest in Geology,\" ''The Linnean: Newsletter and Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London'' 16/1 (January 2000), pp. 31\u201347</ref> studying [[archeology|archaeological]] artefacts from London excavations, and interested in [[entomology]]. In all these areas, she drew and painted her specimens with increasing skill. By the 1890s, her scientific interests centred on [[mycology]]. First drawn to fungi because of their colours and evanescence in nature and her delight in painting them, her interest deepened after meeting Charles McIntosh, a revered naturalist and amateur mycologist, during a summer holiday in Dunkeld in [[Perthshire]] in 1892. He helped improve the accuracy of her illustrations, taught her [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and supplied her with live specimens to paint during the winter. Curious as to how fungi reproduced, Potter began microscopic drawings of fungus spores (the [[agaric]]s) and in 1895 developed a theory of their [[germination]].<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 81\u2013103</ref> Through the connections of her uncle [[Henry Enfield Roscoe|Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe]], a chemist and [[vice-chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]] of the [[University of London]], she consulted with botanists at [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew Gardens]], convincing [[George Edward Massee|George Massee]] of her ability to germinate spores and her theory of [[F1 hybrid|hybridisation]].<ref>Lear 2007, p. 117</ref> She did not believe in the theory of [[symbiosis]] proposed by [[Simon Schwendener]], the German mycologist, as previously thought; instead, she proposed a more independent process of reproduction.<ref>M.A. Taylor and R.H.

It was introduced by Massee because, as a female, Potter could not attend proceedings or read her paper. She subsequently withdrew it, realising that some of her samples were contaminated, but continued her microscopic studies for several more years. Her paper has only recently been rediscovered, along with the rich, artistic illustrations and drawings that accompanied it. Her work is only now being properly evaluated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beatrix Potter and the Linnean Society|url=http://www.linnean.org/index.php?id=104|publisher=Linnean Society|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref><ref>Lear 2007, pp. 104\u201325</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Publications/The-Linnaen/Lin%20Vol%2016_%20no%201_%20Jan%202000.pdf |last=Watling |first=Roy |title=Helen Beatrix Potter: Her interest in fungi |work=The Linnean: Newsletter and Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London |volume=16 |issue=1 |date=January 2000 |pages=24\u201331 |authorlink=Roy Watling |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513210936/https://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Publications/The-Linnaen/Lin%20Vol%2016_%20no%201_%20Jan%202000.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2013  }}</ref> Potter later gave her other mycological and scientific drawings to the [[Armitt Library|Armitt Museum and Library]] in Ambleside, where mycologists still refer to them to identify fungi. There is also a collection of her fungus paintings at the [[Perth Museum and Art Gallery]] in Perth, Scotland, donated by Charles McIntosh. In 1967, the mycologist [[Walter Philip Kennedy Findlay|W.P.K. Findlay]] included many of Potter's beautifully accurate fungus drawings in his ''Wayside & Woodland Fungi'', thereby fulfilling her desire to one day have her fungus drawings published in a book.<ref>Walter Philip Kennedy Findlay, (1967) ''Wayside & Woodland Fungi''</ref> In 1997, the Linnean Society issued a posthumous apology to Potter for the sexism displayed in its handling of her research.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 125, p.482nn58</ref>\n\n===Artistic and literary career===\n[[File:Peter Rabbit first edition 1902a.jpg|thumb|upright|First edition, 1902]]\nPotter's artistic and literary interests were deeply influenced by fairies, fairy tales and fantasy. She was a student of the classic fairy tales of Western Europe. As well as stories from the [[Old Testament]], [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', she grew up with ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'', the fairy tales of the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|The Water Babies]]'',<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 30\u20131</ref> the folk tales and [[Scottish mythology|mythology of Scotland]], the [[German Romanticism|German Romantics]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],<ref>Lear 2007, p. 95. She liked to memorise his plays by heart.</ref> and the romances of [[Sir Walter Scott]].<ref>Lear 2007, p. 35. Beatrix said she learnt to read \"on\" Scott</ref> As a young child, before the age of eight, [[Edward Lear]]'s ''Book of Nonsense'', including the much loved ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]'', and [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' had made their impression, although she later said of ''Alice'' that she was more interested in [[John Tenniel|Tenniel]]'s illustrations than what they were about.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 34</ref> The ''[[Brer Rabbit]]'' stories of [[Joel Chandler Harris]] had been family favourites, and she later studied his ''[[Uncle Remus]]'' stories and illustrated them.<ref>Lear 2007, p.131. She began eight ''Uncle Remus'' drawings in the same year 1893 she began writing the ''Peter Rabbit'' picture letters to Noel Moore, completing the last in 1896.</ref> She studied book illustration from a young age and developed her own tastes, but the work of the picture book triumvirate [[Walter Crane]], [[Kate Greenaway]] and [[Randolph Caldecott]], the last an illustrator whose work was later collected by her father, was a great influence.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 33</ref> When she started to illustrate, she chose first the traditional rhymes and stories, \"[[Cinderella]]\", \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\", \"[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]\", \"[[Puss in Boots|Puss-in-boots]]\", and \"[[Red Riding Hood]]\".<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 127\u20138</ref> However, most often her illustrations were fantasies featuring her own pets: mice, rabbits, kittens, and guinea pigs.<ref>Taylor, et al., ''The Artist and her World,'' pp. 49\u201370;  Potter, ''Journal, 1884\u20131897''; Humphrey Carpenter (1985), ''Secret Gardens: The Golden Age of Children\u2019s Literature.''</ref>\n\nIn her teenage years, Potter was a regular visitor to the art galleries of London, particularly enjoying the summer and winter exhibitions at the [[Royal Academy]] in London.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 47-8. [[J. M. W. Turner]] was the first artist to impress her.</ref> Her ''Journal'' reveals her growing sophistication as a critic as well as the influence of her father's friend, the artist [[Sir John Everett Millais]], who recognised Beatrix's talent of observation. Although Potter was aware of art and artistic trends, her drawing and her prose style were uniquely her own.<ref>Taylor, ''Artist, Storyteller,'' pp. 70\u201395; Taylor, ed. 1989, ''Beatrix Potters Letters''.</ref>\n\nAs a way to earn money in the 1890s, Beatrix and her brother began to print Christmas cards of their own design, as well as cards for special occasions. Mice and rabbits were the most frequent subject of her fantasy paintings. In 1890, the firm of Hildesheimer and Faulkner bought several of the drawings of her rabbit [[Benjamin Bunny]] to illustrate verses by [[Frederic Weatherly]] titled ''A Happy Pair''. In 1893, the same printer bought several more drawings for Weatherly's ''Our Dear Relations'', another book of rhymes, and the following year Potter sold a series of frog illustrations and verses for ''Changing Pictures'', a popular annual offered by the art publisher Ernest Nister. Potter was pleased by this success and determined to publish her own illustrated stories.<ref>Taylor, et al. 1987, pp. 107\u2013148; Katherine Chandler, \"Thoroughly Post-Victorian, Pre-Modern Beatrix.\" ''Children's Literature Quarterly''. 32(4): 287\u2013307.</ref>\n\nWhenever Potter went on holiday to the [[Lake District]] or [[Scotland]], she sent letters to young friends, illustrating them with quick sketches. Many of these letters were written to the children of her former governess Annie Carter Moore, particularly to Moore's eldest son Noel who was often ill. In September 1893, Potter was on holiday at Eastwood in [[Dunkeld]], Perthshire. She had run out of things to say to Noel, and so she told him a story about \"four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter\". It became one of the most famous children's letters ever written and the basis of Potter's future career as a writer-artist-storyteller.<ref>Judy Taylor 1992, ''Letters to Children from Beatrix Potter''.</ref>\n[[File:Beatrix Potter dummy manuscripts.jpg|thumb|left|Potter's dummy manuscripts of three of her books \u2013 designed to see how the printed book would look]]\nIn 1900, Potter revised her tale about the four little rabbits, and fashioned a dummy book of it \u2013 it has been suggested, in imitation of [[Helen Bannerman]]'s 1899 bestseller ''[[The Story of Little Black Sambo]]''.<ref>Stevenson, Laura C. \"A Vogue for Small Books\": The Tale of Peter Rabbit and its Contemporary Competitors\" [http://www.lauracstevenson.org/avogueoflittlebooks.htm]</ref> Unable to find a buyer for the work, she published it for family and friends at her own expense in December 1901. It was drawn in black and white with a coloured frontispiece. Rawnsley had great faith in Potter's tale, recast it in didactic verse, and made the rounds of the London publishing houses. [[Frederick Warne & Co]] had previously rejected the tale but, eager to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted the \"bunny book\" (as the firm called it) following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist [[L. Leslie Brooke]].<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 144\u20137</ref> The firm declined Rawnsley's verse in favour of Potter's original prose, and Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations, choosing the then-new [[Edmund Evans#Later work and retirement|Hentschel three-colour process]] to reproduce her watercolours.<ref name=\"Hobbs15\">Hobbs 1989, p. 15</ref>\n[[File:Tower Bank Arms.jpg|thumb|right|Potter used many real locations for her book illustrations. The Tower Bank Arms, Near Sawrey appears in ''The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck''.]]\nOn 2 October 1902, ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' was published,<ref>Taylor 1996, p. 76</ref> and was an immediate success. It was followed the next year by ''[[The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin]]'' and ''[[The Tailor of Gloucester]]'', which had also first been written as picture letters to the Moore children. Working with [[Norman Warne]] as her editor, Potter published two or three little books each year: 23 books in all. The last book in this format was ''[[Cecily Parsley's Nursery Rhymes]]'' in 1922, a collection of favourite rhymes. Although ''[[The Tale of Little Pig Robinson]]'' was not published until 1930, it had been written much earlier. Potter continued creating her little books until after the [[First World War]] when her energies were increasingly directed toward her farming, sheep-breeding and land conservation.<ref>Judy Taylor 2002, ''That Naughty Rabbit: Beatrix Potter and Peter Rabbit'';  Lear 2007, pp. 207\u2013247; Anne Stevenson Hobbs, ed. 1989, ''Beatrix Potter\u2019s Art: Paintings and Drawings''.</ref>\n\nThe immense popularity of Potter's books was based on the lively quality of her illustrations, the non-didactic nature of her stories, the depiction of the rural countryside, and the imaginative qualities she lent to her animal characters.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qdVTAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA165|last=Kutzer|first=M.

As early as 1903, she made and patented a [[Peter Rabbit]] doll. It was followed by other \"spin-off\" merchandise over the years, including painting books, board games, wall-paper, figurines, baby blankets and china tea-sets. All were licensed by [[Frederick Warne & Co]] and earned Potter an independent income, as well as immense profits for her publisher.<ref>See Judy Taylor 2002, \"That Naughty Rabbit\"</ref>\n\nIn 1905, Potter and [[Norman Warne]] became unofficially engaged. Potter's parents objected to the match because Warne was \"in trade\" and thus not socially suitable. The engagement lasted only one month until Warne died of [[pernicious anaemia]] at age 37.<ref>Lear 2007, pp.198- 201</ref> That same year, Potter used some of her income and a small inheritance from an aunt to buy [[Hill Top Farm]] in [[Near Sawrey]] in the English [[Lake District]] near Windermere. Potter and Warne may have hoped that Hill Top Farm would be their holiday home, but after Warne's death, Potter went ahead with its purchase as she had always wanted to own that farm, and live in \"that charming village\".<ref>Lear 2007, p. 207</ref>\n\n===Country life===\n[[File:Hill Top Farm.jpg|thumb|right|Hill Top, Near Sawrey&nbsp;\u2013 Potter's former home, now owned by the National Trust and preserved as it was when she lived and wrote her stories there.]]\nThe tenant farmer John Cannon and his family agreed to stay on to manage the farm for her while she made physical improvements and learned the techniques of [[fell farming]] and of raising livestock, including pigs, cows and chickens; the following year she added sheep. Realising she needed to protect her boundaries, she sought advice from W.H. Heelis & Son, a local firm of solicitors with offices in nearby [[Hawkshead]]. With William Heelis acting for her, she bought contiguous pasture, and in 1909 the {{convert|20|acre|ha}} Castle Farm across the road from Hill Top Farm. She visited Hill Top at every opportunity, and her books written during this period (such as ''[[The Tale of Ginger and Pickles]]'', about the local shop in Near Sawrey and ''[[The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse]]'', a wood mouse) reflect her increasing participation in village life and her delight in country living.<ref>Taylor, ed., (2002) ''Beatrix Potter's Letters''; Hunter Davies, ''Beatrix Potter's Lakeland''; W.R. Mitchell, ''Potter: Her Life in the Lake District''.</ref>\n\nOwning and managing these working farms required routine collaboration with the widely respected William Heelis. By the summer of 1912, Heelis had proposed marriage and Beatrix had accepted; although she did not immediately tell her parents, who once again disapproved because Heelis was only a country solicitor. Potter and Heelis were married on 15 October 1913 in London at [[St Mary Abbots]] in [[Kensington]]. The couple moved immediately to [[Near and Far Sawrey|Near Sawrey]], residing at Castle Cottage, the renovated farmhouse on Castle Farm, which was 34 acres large. Hill Top remained a working farm but was now remodelled to allow for the tenant family and Potter's private studio and workshop. At last her own woman, Potter settled into the partnerships that shaped the rest of her life: her country solicitor husband and his large family, her farms, the Sawrey community and the predictable rounds of country life. ''[[The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Tom Kitten]]'' are representative of Hill Top Farm and her farming life and reflect her happiness with her country life.<ref>John Heelis, (1999) ''The Tale of Mrs William Heelis&nbsp;\u2013 Beatrix Potter''; Lear, Ch. 13.</ref>\n\nRupert Potter died in 1914 and, with the outbreak of [[World War I]], Potter, now a wealthy woman, persuaded her mother to move to the Lake District and found a property for her to rent in Sawrey. Finding life in Sawrey dull, Helen Potter soon moved to Lindeth Howe (now a 34 bedroomed hotel) a large house the Potters had previously rented for the summer in [[Bowness-on-Windermere|Bowness]], on the other side of Lake Windermere,<ref>{{cite book|last= McDowell|first= Marta|title=Beatrix Potter's Gardening Life: The Plants and Places That Inspired the classic children's tales|publisher=Timber Press|date=2013|pages=116|isbn=1604693630}}</ref> Potter continued to write stories for Frederick Warne & Co and fully participated in country life. She established a Nursing Trust for local villages and served on various committees and councils responsible for footpaths and other rural issues.<ref>Taylor et al. ''The Artist and Her World'', pp. 185\u2013194; Taylor, ''Artist Storyteller'', pp. 105\u2013144.</ref>\n\n===Sheep farming===\nSoon after acquiring Hill Top Farm, Potter became keenly interested in the breeding and raising of [[Herdwick|Herdwick sheep]], the indigenous fell sheep. In 1923 she bought a large sheep farm in the Troutbeck Valley called [[Troutbeck Park|Troutbeck Park Farm]], formerly a deer park, restoring its land with thousands of Herdwick sheep. This established her as one of the major Herdwick sheep farmers in the county. She was admired by her shepherds and farm managers for her willingness to experiment with the latest biological remedies for the common diseases of sheep, and for her employment of the best shepherds, sheep breeders, and farm managers.<ref>William Rollinson, (1981) ''How They Lived in the Lake District''; Susan Denyer, 1993 ''Herdwick Sheep Farming''; Geoff Brown, (2009) ''Herdwicks: Herdwick Sheep and the English Lake District''; Judy Taylor, ed., (1998) ''Beatrix Potter\u2019s Farming Friendship. Lake District Letters to Joseph Moscrop, 1926\u20131943''.</ref>\n\nBy the late 1920s, Potter and her Hill Top farm manager Tom Storey had made a name for their prize-winning Herdwick flock, which took many prizes at the local agricultural shows, where Potter was often asked to serve as a judge. In 1942 she became President-elect of the Herdwick Sheepbreeders\u2019 Association, the first time a woman had been elected but died before taking office.<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 381\u2013404</ref>\n\n==Lake District conservation==\n{{no reference|section|date=July 2019}}\nPotter had been a disciple of the land conservation and preservation ideals of her long-time friend and mentor, [[Hardwicke Rawnsley|Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley]], the first secretary and founding member of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]]. She supported the efforts of the National Trust to preserve not just the places of extraordinary beauty but also those heads of valleys and low grazing lands that would be irreparably ruined by development. Potter was also an authority on the traditional Lakeland crafts, period furniture and stonework. She restored and preserved the farms that she bought or managed, making sure that each farm house had in it a piece of antique Lakeland furniture. Potter was interested in preserving not only the [[Herdwick sheep]] but also the way of life of fell farming. In 1930 the Heelises became partners with the National Trust in buying and managing the fell farms included in the large Monk Coniston Estate. The estate was composed of many farms spread over a wide area of north-western Lancashire, including the [[Tarn Hows]]. Potter was the ''de facto'' estate manager for the Trust for seven years until the National Trust could afford to repurchase most of the property from her. Potter's stewardship of these farms earned her full regard, but she was not without her critics, not the least of which were her contemporaries who felt she used her wealth and the position of her husband to acquire properties in advance of their being made public. She was notable in observing the problems of [[afforestation]], preserving the intake grazing lands, and husbanding the quarries and timber on these farms. All her farms were stocked with Herdwick sheep and frequently with [[Galloway cattle]].\n[[File:Derwent Water, Lake District, Cumbria - June 2009.jpg|thumb|Lake District]]\n\n==Later life==\nPotter continued to write stories and to draw, although mostly for her own pleasure. Her books in the late 1920s included the semi-autobiographical ''[[The Fairy Caravan]]'', a fanciful tale set in her beloved [[Troutbeck Tongue|Troutbeck fells]]. It was published only in the US during Potter's lifetime, and not until 1952 in the UK. ''Sister Anne'', Potter's version of the story of [[Bluebeard]], was written for her American readers, but illustrated by Katharine Sturges. A final folktale, ''Wag by Wall'', was published posthumously by ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'' in 1944. Potter was a generous patron of the [[Girl Guides]], whose troupes she allowed to make their summer encampments on her land, and whose company she enjoyed as an older woman.<ref>Jane Morse, ed., (1982) ''Beatrix Potter's Americans: Selected Letters''; Susan Denyer, (2000) ''At Home with Beatrix Potter: The Creator of Peter Rabbit''.</ref>\n\nPotter and William Heelis enjoyed a happy marriage of thirty years, continuing their farming and preservation efforts throughout the hard days of [[World War II]]. Although they were childless, Potter played an important role in William's large family, particularly enjoying her relationship with several nieces whom she helped educate, and giving comfort and aid to her husband's brothers and sisters.<ref>Heelis, ''Mrs. William Heelis''; Taylor, ed., ''Beatrix Potter's Letters''.</ref>\n\nPotter died of complications from [[pneumonia]] and [[heart disease]] on 22 December 1943 at Castle Cottage, and her remains were cremated at [[Carleton Crematorium and Cemetery|Carleton Crematorium]]. She left nearly all her property to the National Trust, including over {{convert|4000|acre|km2}} of land, sixteen farms, cottages and herds of cattle and Herdwick sheep. Hers was the largest gift at that time to the National Trust, and it enabled the preservation of the land now included in the [[Lake District National Park]] and the continuation of fell farming. The central office of the National Trust in [[Swindon]] was named \"Heelis\" in 2005 in her memory. William Heelis continued his stewardship of their properties and of her literary and artistic work for the twenty months he survived her. When he died in August 1945, he left the remainder to the National Trust.<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 405\u2013440; Taylor, ed., ''Beatrix Potter's Letters''; Taylor, et al., ''The Artist and Her World''.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Goody and Mrs. Hackee.jpg|thumb|left|Goody and Mrs. Hackee, illustration to ''The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes'', 1911]]\nPotter left almost all the original illustrations for her books to the National Trust. The copyright to her stories and merchandise was then given to her publisher Frederick Warne & Co, now a division of the [[Penguin Group]]. On 1 January 2014, the copyright expired in the UK and other countries with a 70-years-after-death limit. Hill Top Farm was opened to the public by the National Trust in 1946; her artwork was displayed there until 1985 when it was moved to William Heelis's former law offices in [[Hawkshead]], also owned by the National Trust as the [[Beatrix Potter Gallery]].<ref>Bruce L.

The term is typically used to refer to the [[List of European countries by area|six smallest states in Europe by area]]: [[Andorra]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Malta]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]], and [[Vatican City]].<ref>Klieger, P. C. (2012). ''The Microstates of Europe: Designer Nations in a Post-Modern World''. Lexington Books.</ref> Four of these states are [[monarchy|monarchies]] (three [[principality|principalities]]\u2014Andorra, Liechtenstein, and Monaco\u2014and one papacy, the Vatican City), with all these states tracing their status back to the first millennium or the early second millennium, except for Liechtenstein, created in the 17th century.\n\n[[Microstate]]s are small independent states recognized by larger states. According to the qualitative definition suggested by Dumienski (2014), microstates can also be viewed as \"modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://ams.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Microstates_OccasionalPaper.pdf|title = Microstates as Modern Protected States: Towards a New Definition of Micro-Statehood|last = Dumienski|first = Zbigniew|date = 2014|journal = |accessdate = 06.07.14|doi = |publisher = Centre for Small State Studies|series = Occasional Paper}}</ref> In line with this definition, only [[Andorra]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[San Marino]], and [[Monaco]] qualify as \"microstates\" as only these states are sovereignties functioning in close, but voluntary, association with their respective larger neighbours.

The County of Foix merged into the [[French monarchy|French Crown]] in 1607 and thus the King of France and then the [[President of France]] took the place of the Count of Foix. Since 1993 Andorra has been a parliamentary democracy, but it maintains two Co-Princes, one being France's elected head of state and the other being the Bishop of Urgell.

After the unification of Italy in the 19th century the Papal States had become formally part of the Kingdom of Italy, but the Vatican disputed this claim of geographic authority, and the Papacy continued to exercise ''de facto'' political control over an area around [[St Peter's Basilica]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} in Rome.  A sovereign Vatican state was later established by the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 between the Pope and the government of [[Benito Mussolini]], in which the Pope recognised the Italian state in exchange for establishing [[Roman Catholicism]] as the [[state religion]], and recognition of the Pope's sovereignty over a tiny state located entirely within the city of [[Rome]]. Its population is between 600 and 700.\n\nThe [[Holy See]] is a unique sovereign entity under international law distinct from Vatican City with the [[pope]] as the head of both, maintaining diplomatic and official relations with over 170 states and entities and participating in various [[international organization]]s either in its own capacity or on behalf of Vatican City.\n|-\n\n|}\n\n==Economic policies and relationship with the European Union==\n{{main article|Microstates and the European Union}}\nThe European microstates are all of limited size and population, and have limited natural resources. As a result, they have adopted special economic policies, typically involving low levels of taxation and few restrictions on external financial investment. Malta is a full member of the [[European Union]], while the other five European microstates have obtained special [[Microstates and the European Union|relations with the European Union]]. Many of the microstates have also entered into a [[customs union]] with their larger neighbours to improve their economic situation (Vatican City and San Marino with [[Italy]], Liechtenstein with [[Switzerland]], Monaco with [[France]]). Most of them lack clearly marked borders; for example, Monaco forms a continuous metropolitan area with its neighboring French communes (the largest being [[Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritimes|Beausoleil]]) and has many streets running across or even along the border.\n\n==Similar entities==\n\n===Dependencies===\nWhile the microstates have sovereignty over their own territory, there are also a number of small [[autonomous territories]], which despite having (in almost all cases) their own independent government, executive branch, legislature, judiciary, police, and other trappings of independence, are nonetheless under the sovereignty of another [[Sovereign state|state]] or [[monarch]].\n\n*[[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] ([[British overseas territory]], [[United Kingdom]])\n*[[\u00c5land Islands]] (External territory, [[Finland]])\n*[[Faroe Islands]] (External territory, [[Denmark]])\n*[[Gibraltar]] (British overseas territory, United Kingdom)\n*[[Bailiwick of Guernsey]],  ([[British monarchy|British]] [[Crown dependency]]) consisting of three separate sub-jurisdictions: [[Guernsey]], [[Alderney]], and [[Sark]]\n*[[Isle of Man]] (British Crown dependency)\n*[[Jersey]] (British Crown dependency), one of the [[Channel Islands]]\n*[[Monastic Republic of Mount Athos|Mount Athos]] (autonomous monastic state, [[Greece]])\n\n===Sovereign Military Order of Malta===\n[[File:Flag of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.svg|right|120px|thumb|Flag of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]\nThe [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]  is a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Catholic religious order|lay order]] that is a traditional example of a sovereign entity under international law other than a state.\n\nUnlike the Holy See, which is sovereign over the Vatican City, the Order has no territory. However, its headquarters, located in [[Palazzo Malta]] and [[Villa del Priorato di Malta|Villa Malta]], are granted [[extraterritoriality]] by Italy, and the same status is recognized by [[Malta]] to its historical headquarters, located in [[Fort St Angelo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.orderofmalta.int/2001/03/13/after-two-centuries-the-order-of-malta-flag-flies-over-fort-st-angelo-beside-the-maltese-flag/ |title=After Two Centuries, The Order Of Malta Flag Flies Over Fort St. Angelo, Beside The Maltese Flag \u00bb Sovereign Order Of Malta - Official Site |publisher=Orderofmalta.int |accessdate=2016-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916163852/https://www.orderofmalta.int/2001/03/13/after-two-centuries-the-order-of-malta-flag-flies-over-fort-st-angelo-beside-the-maltese-flag/ |archive-date=16 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nThe Order is the direct successor to the medieval [[Knights Hospitaller]], also known as the Knights of Malta, and today operates as a largely charitable and ceremonial organization.\n\nIt has [[United Nations General Assembly observers|permanent observer status]] at the [[United Nations]] and has full diplomatic relations, including embassies, with 100 states<ref>The Order's official website lists them [https://www.orderofmalta.int/diplomatic-activities/bilateral-relations/ in this table] |date=19 November 2016.</ref> and it is in more informal relationships with five others. It issues its own stamps, coins, passports, and license plates, and has its own [[Military of the Sovereign Order of Malta|army medical corps]].\n\n==Historical small territories==\nThe wars of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] caused the European map to be redrawn several times. A number of short-lived [[French client republic|client republics]] were created, and the [[Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire|fall]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] gave sovereignty to each of its many surviving ''[[Kleinstaaterei]]''. The situation was not stabilized until after the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. Following [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] a number of territories gained temporary status as [[international zone]]s, [[protectorate]]s or occupied territories.

After the unification of Italy in the 19th century the Papal States had become formally part of the Kingdom of Italy, but the Vatican disputed this claim of geographic authority, and the Papacy continued to exercise ''de facto'' political control over an area around [[St Peter's Basilica]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} in Rome.  A sovereign Vatican state was later established by the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 between the Pope and the government of [[Benito Mussolini]], in which the Pope recognised the Italian state in exchange for establishing [[Roman Catholicism]] as the [[state religion]], and recognition of the Pope's sovereignty over a tiny state located entirely within the city of [[Rome]]. Its population is between 600 and 700.\n\nThe [[Holy See]] is a unique sovereign entity under international law distinct from Vatican City with the [[pope]] as the head of both, maintaining diplomatic and official relations with over 170 states and entities and participating in various [[international organization]]s either in its own capacity or on behalf of Vatican City.\n|-\n\n|}\n\n==Economic policies and relationship with the European Union==\n{{main article|Microstates and the European Union}}\nThe European microstates are all of limited size and population, and have limited natural resources. As a result, they have adopted special economic policies, typically involving low levels of taxation and few restrictions on external financial investment. Malta is a full member of the [[European Union]], while the other five European microstates have obtained special [[Microstates and the European Union|relations with the European Union]]. Many of the microstates have also entered into a [[customs union]] with their larger neighbours to improve their economic situation (Vatican City and San Marino with [[Italy]], Liechtenstein with [[Switzerland]], Monaco with [[France]]). Most of them lack clearly marked borders; for example, Monaco forms a continuous metropolitan area with its neighboring French communes (the largest being [[Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritimes|Beausoleil]]) and has many streets running across or even along the border.\n\n==Similar entities==\n\n===Dependencies===\nWhile the microstates have sovereignty over their own territory, there are also a number of small [[autonomous territories]], which despite having (in almost all cases) their own independent government, executive branch, legislature, judiciary, police, and other trappings of independence, are nonetheless under the sovereignty of another [[Sovereign state|state]] or [[monarch]].\n\n*[[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] ([[British overseas territory]], [[United Kingdom]])\n*[[\u00c5land Islands]] (External territory, [[Finland]])\n*[[Faroe Islands]] (External territory, [[Denmark]])\n*[[Gibraltar]] (British overseas territory, United Kingdom)\n*[[Bailiwick of Guernsey]],  ([[British monarchy|British]] [[Crown dependency]]) consisting of three separate sub-jurisdictions: [[Guernsey]], [[Alderney]], and [[Sark]]\n*[[Isle of Man]] (British Crown dependency)\n*[[Jersey]] (British Crown dependency), one of the [[Channel Islands]]\n*[[Monastic Republic of Mount Athos|Mount Athos]] (autonomous monastic state, [[Greece]])\n\n===Sovereign Military Order of Malta===\n[[File:Flag of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.svg|right|120px|thumb|Flag of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]\nThe [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]  is a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Catholic religious order|lay order]] that is a traditional example of a sovereign entity under international law other than a state.\n\nUnlike the Holy See, which is sovereign over the Vatican City, the Order has no territory. However, its headquarters, located in [[Palazzo Malta]] and [[Villa del Priorato di Malta|Villa Malta]], are granted [[extraterritoriality]] by Italy, and the same status is recognized by [[Malta]] to its historical headquarters, located in [[Fort St Angelo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.orderofmalta.int/2001/03/13/after-two-centuries-the-order-of-malta-flag-flies-over-fort-st-angelo-beside-the-maltese-flag/ |title=After Two Centuries, The Order Of Malta Flag Flies Over Fort St. Angelo, Beside The Maltese Flag \u00bb Sovereign Order Of Malta - Official Site |publisher=Orderofmalta.int |accessdate=2016-10-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916163852/https://www.orderofmalta.int/2001/03/13/after-two-centuries-the-order-of-malta-flag-flies-over-fort-st-angelo-beside-the-maltese-flag/ |archive-date=16 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nThe Order is the direct successor to the medieval [[Knights Hospitaller]], also known as the Knights of Malta, and today operates as a largely charitable and ceremonial organization.\n\nIt has [[United Nations General Assembly observers|permanent observer status]] at the [[United Nations]] and has full diplomatic relations, including embassies, with 100 states<ref>The Order's official website lists them [https://www.orderofmalta.int/diplomatic-activities/bilateral-relations/ in this table] |date=19 November 2016.</ref> and it is in more informal relationships with five others.

A number of short-lived [[French client republic|client republics]] were created, and the [[Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire|fall]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] gave sovereignty to each of its many surviving ''[[Kleinstaaterei]]''. The situation was not stabilized until after the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815.
