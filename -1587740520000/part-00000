When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in an armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] at 3:00pm on the day of the bombing in which the Commodore was used to [[Ram-raiding |ram-raid]] the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at[[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed (born Peter Komiazyk) was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in matters relating to several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\nOne of the addresses under surveillance was a house of an associate on Haros Street in [[Nunawading, Victoria | Nunawading]]. Police checks on the house identified the associate as Karl Zelinka, while Zelinka had no criminal background, he was known to Reed who visited Zelinka on multiple occasions.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided Zelinka's house, evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka admitted that he knew Peter Reed through his association with Craig Minogue, Zelinka also admitted that he saw Craig Minogue pulling into the garage of Zelinka's home in a Commodore identical to the bomb car. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney for the Easter Holiday just before the bombing occurred with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka's home. Zelinka then admitted that Craig Minogue had told him to grab the lid of Zelinka's metal rubbish bin and put it on the a pile in the trailer. When the detectives asked about the pile in the trailer, Zelinka admitted that the Minogue Brothers took the pile in the trailer to a rubbish tip.   \n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor had a extensive criminal record dating back to the late 1940s. Taylor first became known to the authorities at the age of 8 when he was arrested for truancy and spent two years in the Bayswater Boys Home at [[The Basin, Victoria | The Basin]] where he was subjected to abuse from the other inmates and staff and was introduced to a life of crime. In 1949, he was arrested for fishing in prohibited area. During his young adult years, Taylor had been in and out of jail on criminal charges relating to theft of motorcycles and burglary. In 1961, Taylor was convicted of an armed robbery on a [[Milk bar | milk bar]] in [[Clayton, Victoria | Clayton]] and was sent to [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division where met [[Ronald Ryan]]. Ryan had asked Taylor to accompanied him on his 1965 escape but Taylor refused. Instead, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge only to be recaptured five days later during which, he committed seven bank robberies.      \n\nWhile in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and was released in 1978. After his release, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. Taylor was also a bit actor, in 1979, he starred in an episode of [[Prisoner (TV series) | Prisoner]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/russell-street-bomber-the-dying-embers-of-hate-20150611-ghlatl.html|title=Russell Street Bomber: the dying embers of hate|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2015-06-11|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDetectives arrested Taylor at his home in [[Birchip, Victoria | Birchip]] on the 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any crime, but admitted that both Craig and Rodney Minogue and Peter Reed were responsible for the Russell Street Bombing.\n\nDetectives then ran a search for Craig and Rodney Minogue and found that they moved into a house within close distance of Taylor's home in Birchip, a raid on the house failed to locate the Minogue Brother but turned up evidence linking them to Russell Street Bombing. At the house, detectives recovered an large drill machine that matched to the drill marks on both the stolen silver Commodore and on the bomb car.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nProsecutors did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (i.e. never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

The explosion caused a massive amount of damage to the police station and surrounding buildings, estimated at more than A$1&nbsp;million.  ''[[The Age]]'' reported that the blast's impact was enhanced by the open-floor design of the offices, which had acted like a [[M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine|Claymore mine]], sending more shrapnel as the blast ripped through the floors and adding more pressure to the blast as it followed its path.

The caller contacted Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact again, Commissioner Miller and Victoria's Premier[[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the caller's price as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car in front of the Russell Street Police HQ at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, in a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table, making him a prime suspect, He was later arrested in Sydney on 15 April 1986 and was brought back to Melbourne. Under police questioning, Crupi denied that he had any involvement in the bombing but admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street. Crupi also stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria |Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria |East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria |St. Albans]] where he had stolen another car from a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria |Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in an armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] at 3:00pm on the day of the bombing in which the Commodore was used to [[Ram-raiding |ram-raid]] the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at[[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed (born Peter Komiazyk) was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in matters relating to several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\nDuring the surveillance, the surveillance team observed Reed pulling into driveway of a house of an associate on Haros Street in [[Nunawading, Victoria | Nunawading]]. Police checks on the house identified the associate as Karl Zelinka, while Zelinka had no criminal background, he was known to Reed who visited Zelinka on multiple occasions.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided Zelinka's house, evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka admitted that he knew Peter Reed through his association with Craig Minogue, Zelinka also admitted that he saw Craig Minogue pulling into the garage of Zelinka's home in a Commodore identical to the bomb car.

Cartman, with the help of a scientist (Randy), an engineer ([[Butters Stotch]]'s mother [[List of South Park families#Stephen and Linda Stotch|Linda]]) and a \"[[Tokenism|black man to sacrifice himself in case anything goes wrong]]\" ([[Chef (South Park)|Chef]]), builds a giant [[drill]] to bore through the hippie crowd.

He is the 4th and current [[President of Rwanda]], having taken office in 2000 when his predecessor, [[Pasteur Bizimungu]], resigned.

When he was two years old, the [[Rwandan Revolution]] ended centuries of Tutsi political dominance; his family fled to [[Uganda]], where he spent the rest of his childhood. In the 1980s, Kagame fought in [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s rebel army, becoming a senior Ugandan army officer after Museveni's military victories carried him to the [[President of Uganda|Ugandan presidency]]. Kagame joined the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), which [[Rwandan Civil War|invaded Rwanda]] in 1990. RPF leader [[Fred Rwigyema]] died early in the war and Kagame took control. By 1993, the RPF controlled significant territory in Rwanda and [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|a ceasefire]] was negotiated. The [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|assassination]] of Rwandan President [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] set off the genocide, in which [[Hutu]] extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu. Kagame resumed the civil war, and ended the genocide with a military victory.\n\nDuring his vice presidency, Kagame controlled the national army and maintained law and order, while other officials began rebuilding the country. Many RPF soldiers carried out retribution killings. Kagame said he did not support these killings but failed to stop them. A small number of these soldiers were later put on trial. Hutu refugee camps formed in [[Zaire]] and other countries. These camps were given food and medical aid by several western governments and aid agencies. The RPF attacked the camps in 1996, forcing many refugees to return home, but insurgents continued to attack Rwanda. The attack on the refugee camps killed an estimated 200,000 people. As part of the invasion, Kagame sponsored two controversial rebel wars in Zaire. The Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels won the [[First Congo War|first war]] (1996\u201397), installing [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]] as [[List of heads of state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|president]] in place of dictator [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Mobutu]] and renaming the country as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC). The [[Second Congo War|second war]] was launched in 1998 against Kabila, and later his son [[Joseph Kabila|Joseph]], following the DRC government's expulsion of Rwandan and Ugandan military forces from the country. The war escalated into a conflict that lasted until a 2003 peace deal and ceasefire.\n\nAs president, Kagame has prioritized national development, launching [[Vision 2020 (Rwanda)|a programme]] to develop Rwanda as a [[middle-income country]] by 2020 (Vision 2020). As of 2013, the country is developing strongly on key indicators, including health care and education; annual growth between 2004 and 2010 averaged {{percentage|8|100}} per year. Kagame has had mostly good relations with the [[East African Community]] and the United States; his relations with France were poor until 2009. Relations with the DRC remain tense despite the 2003 ceasefire; human rights groups and a leaked United Nations report allege Rwandan support for two insurgencies in the country, a charge Kagame denies.  Several countries suspended aid payments in 2012 following these allegations. Kagame is popular in Rwanda and with some foreign observers; human rights groups accuse him of political repression.

In addition, the Rwandan government determined to prosecute all suspected perpetrators, including the many ordinary citizens who had taken part in the killings, in order to end the \"culture of impunity\" that it blamed for the genocide. Between 1994 and 2000, 120,000 suspects were arrested. The prisons were overcrowded and the courts could not process all the cases.

Richard Grant, writing in London's ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', described Kagame as radiating \"a quality of intense seriousness that is both impressive and intimidating\".{{sfn|Grant|2010}} [[Rom\u00e9o Dallaire]], commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda during the Rwandan genocide, described Kagame as having a \"studious air that didn't quite disguise his hawk-like intensity\".{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=66}} Kagame has a highly dominant personality, which he uses to enforce his rule and to ensure that his vision for the country is followed.{{sfn|Grant|2010}} American journalist [[Stephen Kinzer]], who wrote the biography ''A Thousand Hills'' in collaboration with Kagame himself, describes him as \"one of the most intriguing leaders in Africa\".{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=3}} Kinzer credits Kagame with leadership skills that have fostered Rwanda's rebirth following the genocide,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=3}} but also cites a personality of \"chronic impatience, barely suppressed anger, and impulsive scorn for critics\".{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=5}} In his interview with Grant, Kagame claimed he sleeps for only four hours per night, devoting the remainder of his day to work, exercise, family, and reading academic texts and foreign newspapers.{{sfn|Grant|2010}}\n\nIn Rwanda, Kagame's RPF is seen as a Tutsi-dominated party, and in the years following the 1994 genocide, it was deeply unpopular with the Hutu, who constitute {{Percentage|85|100|0}} of the population.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=122\u2013123}} Approximately two million Hutu lived as refugees in neighbouring countries until 1996, when Kagame forced them to return home.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=122\u2013123}} Many Hutu also supported the late 1990s cross-border insurgency against Kagame by defeated forces of the former regime.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=209}} By 1999, when the RPF had weakened the insurgents and the northwest became peaceful, the Hutu population became broadly supportive of Kagame.{{sfn|Brittain|1999}} Since becoming president in 2000, Kagame has won three<!--2003, 2010, and 2017--> disputed presidential elections with over {{Percentage|90|100|0}} of the vote each time. Despite criticisms over opposition repression during these elections, and accusations that the figures were inflated,{{sfn|Reuters (I)|2003}} Kagame does receive genuine support from the population, who credit him with ensuring continued peace, stability, and economic growth.{{sfn|Clark|2010}}\n\nKagame's image amongst international observers is varied. Human rights organisations, including [[Amnesty International]] and [[Freedom House]], claim that Kagame hamstrings his opposition by restricting candidacies in elections to government-friendly parties, suppressing demonstrations, and arresting opposition leaders and journalists.{{sfn|Amnesty International (II)|2010}}{{sfn|Freedom House|2011}} [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Freedom House]] have accused Kagame of using strict laws criminalizing \"divisionism\" (ethnic hatred) and genocide ideology to silence his critics, to the point that Rwanda is a ''de facto'' one-party state.{{sfn|Roth|2009}}{{sfn|Freedom House|2011}}  It has praised some aspects of Kagame's rule, such as the progress made in the delivery of justice and the abolition of the death penalty.{{sfn|HRW|Wells|2008|loc=I.

He was credited with ending the genocide, bringing peace and security to Rwanda, and achieving development. Since 2010, the international community has increasingly criticized Kagame following a leaked United Nations report alleging Rwanda's support for the rebel M23 movement in Congo.{{sfn|BBC News (XV)|2012}} In 2012, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and several other countries suspended programmes of budget support to Rwanda, with many redirecting their aid to project-based assistance.{{sfn|Ford|2012}}\n\nKagame promotes the Internet as a means of communication between leadership and ordinary people. In addition to his personal website, which contains a personal blog, he has accounts on [[Flickr]], [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].{{sfn|Chothia|2010}} In 2011, he argued with British journalist Ian Birrell on Twitter following a tweet by Birrell about media freedom in Rwanda.{{sfn|BBC News (XVIII)|2011}}\n\nKagame has received [[List of awards and honours bestowed upon Paul Kagame|many honours and accolades]] during his presidency.

He is the 4th and current [[President of Rwanda]], having taken office in 2000 when his predecessor, [[Pasteur Bizimungu]], resigned. Kagame previously commanded the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]], the [[Uganda]]-based rebel force that invaded Rwanda and was one of the parties of the conflict during the [[Rwandan genocide]].<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/12/americas-secret-role-in-the-rwandan-genocide|title=America\u2019s secret role in the Rwandan genocide|date=2017-07-12|work=THE Guardian|access-date=2020-02-08|language=en}}</ref> He was considered Rwanda's ''de facto'' leader when he served as [[Vice President of Rwanda|Vice President]] and [[Minister of Defence (Rwanda)|Minister of Defence]] from 1994 to 2000.

When he was two years old, the [[Rwandan Revolution]] ended centuries of Tutsi political dominance; his family fled to [[Uganda]], where he spent the rest of his childhood. In the 1980s, Kagame fought in [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s rebel army, becoming a senior Ugandan army officer after Museveni's military victories carried him to the [[President of Uganda|Ugandan presidency]]. Kagame joined the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), which [[Rwandan Civil War|invaded Rwanda]] in 1990. RPF leader [[Fred Rwigyema]] died early in the war and Kagame took control. By 1993, the RPF controlled significant territory in Rwanda and [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|a ceasefire]] was negotiated. The [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|assassination]] of Rwandan President [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] set off the genocide, in which [[Hutu]] extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu. Kagame resumed the civil war, and ended the genocide with a military victory.\n\nDuring his vice presidency, Kagame controlled the national army and maintained law and order, while other officials began rebuilding the country. Many RPF soldiers carried out retribution killings. Kagame said he did not support these killings but failed to stop them. A small number of these soldiers were later put on trial. Hutu refugee camps formed in [[Zaire]] and other countries. These camps were given food and medical aid by several western governments and aid agencies. The RPF attacked the camps in 1996, forcing many refugees to return home, but insurgents continued to attack Rwanda. The attack on the refugee camps killed an estimated 200,000 people. As part of the invasion, Kagame sponsored two controversial rebel wars in Zaire. The Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels won the [[First Congo War|first war]] (1996\u201397), installing [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]] as [[List of heads of state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|president]] in place of dictator [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Mobutu]] and renaming the country as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC). The [[Second Congo War|second war]] was launched in 1998 against Kabila, and later his son [[Joseph Kabila|Joseph]], following the DRC government's expulsion of Rwandan and Ugandan military forces from the country. The war escalated into a conflict that lasted until a 2003 peace deal and ceasefire.\n\nAs president, Kagame has prioritized national development, launching [[Vision 2020 (Rwanda)|a programme]] to develop Rwanda as a [[middle-income country]] by 2020 (Vision 2020). As of 2013, the country is developing strongly on key indicators, including health care and education; annual growth between 2004 and 2010 averaged {{percentage|8|100}} per year. Kagame has had mostly good relations with the [[East African Community]] and the United States; his relations with France were poor until 2009. Relations with the DRC remain tense despite the 2003 ceasefire; human rights groups and a leaked United Nations report allege Rwandan support for two insurgencies in the country, a charge Kagame denies.  Several countries suspended aid payments in 2012 following these allegations. Kagame is popular in Rwanda and with some foreign observers; human rights groups accuse him of political repression. He won [[2003 Rwandan presidential election|an election]] in 2003, under a [[Rwandan Constitution|new constitution]] adopted that year, and was [[2010 Rwandan presidential election|elected for a second term]] in 2010. Kagame was [[2017 Rwandan presidential election|elected again]] in 2017, and due to yet another change in the constitution, he could potentially be President until 2034.{{sfn|McVeigh|2015}} His role in the assassination of exiled political opponents has been controversial.<ref name=\"theglobeandmail1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/secret-recording-says-former-rwandan-army-major-proves-government-hires-assassins-to-kill-critics-abroad/article18396349/|title=Assassination in Africa: Inside the plots to kill Rwanda's dissidents|access-date=2018-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/rwandan-dissident-in-belgium-a-suspected-target/article18653424/|title=Rwandan dissident in Belgium warned of suspected targeted attack|access-date=2018-11-11}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nKagame was born on 23 October 1957, the youngest of six children,{{sfn|Waugh|2004|p=8}} in Tambwe, [[Ruanda-Urundi]], a village located in what is now the [[Southern Province, Rwanda|Southern Province]] of Rwanda.{{sfn|Office of the President (I)|2011}} His father, Deogratias, was a member of the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group, from which the royal family had been derived since the eighteenth century or earlier.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} Deogratias had family ties to King [[Mutara III of Rwanda|Mutara III]], but he pursued an independent business career rather than maintain a close connection to the royal court.{{sfn|Waugh|2004|p=8}} Kagame's mother, Asteria Rutagambwa, descended from the family of the last Rwandan queen, [[Rosalie Gicanda]].{{sfn|Waugh|2004|p=8}} At the time of Kagame's birth, Rwanda was a [[United Nations Trust Territories|United Nations Trust Territory]]; long-time colonial power [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium]] still ruled the territory, but with a mandate to oversee [[Decolonization of Africa|independence]].{{sfn|United Nations (II)}}{{sfn|United Nations (III)}} Rwandans were made up of three distinct groups: the minority Tutsi were the traditional ruling class, and the Belgian colonialists had long promoted Tutsi supremacy,{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=450}} whilst the majority [[Hutu]] were agriculturalists.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=11\u201312}} The third group, the [[Twa]], were a forest-dwelling [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy people]] descended from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants, who formed less than {{percentage|1|100}} of the population.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}}\n\nTensions between Tutsi and Hutu had been escalating during the 1950s, and culminated in the 1959 [[Rwandan Revolution]]. Hutu activists began killing Tutsi, forcing more than 100,000 Tutsis to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=58\u201359}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=51}} [[Zura Karuhimbi]] later claimed that in 1959 she had saved the life of Kagame by tying beads from her necklace into his hair so that he could pass as a girl and escape execution by the Hutus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-46618482 |title=Obituary: Rwanda's Zura Karuhimbi, who saved dozens from genocide - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2019-05-17}}</ref> Kagame's family abandoned their home and lived for two years in the far northeast of Rwanda and eventually crossing the border into [[Uganda]]. They moved gradually north, and settled in the Nshungerezi refugee camp in the [[Toro sub-region]] in 1962.{{sfn|Waugh|2004|p=8}} It was around this time that, as young boys, Kagame and his future comrade, [[Fred Rwigyema]], first met one another.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=12}}\n\nKagame began his primary education in a school near the refugee camp, where he and other Rwandan refugees learned how to speak [[English language|English]] and began to integrate into Ugandan culture.{{sfn|Waugh|2004|p=10}} At the age of nine, he moved to the respected Rwengoro Primary School, around 16 kilometres (10&nbsp;mi) away, graduating with the best grades in the district.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=13}} He subsequently attended [[Ntare School]], one of the best schools in Uganda. It is also the alma mater of future Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=13}} The death of Kagame's father in the early-1970s, and the departure of Rwigyema to an unknown location, led to a decline in his academic performance and an increased tendency to fight those who belittled the Rwandan population.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=14}} He was eventually suspended from Ntare and completed his studies without distinction at Old Kampala Secondary School.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=15}}\n\nAfter completing his education, Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted by family members of his former classmates, but upon arrival in [[Kigali]]; he made contact with members of his own family.{{sfn|Waugh|2004|pp=16\u201318}} He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest. On his second visit, he entered the country through [[Zaire]] rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion.{{sfn|Waugh|2004|pp=16\u201318}} Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.{{sfn|Waugh|2004|pp=16\u201318}}\n\n==Military career, 1979\u20131994==\n===Ugandan Bush War===\n{{Further|Ugandan Bush War}}\n[[File:Museveni1987.png|thumb|Kagame served under [[Yoweri Museveni]] (pictured) in the Ugandan Bush War.|alt=Profile picture of Yoweri Museveni during a visit to President Reagan of the United States in 1987]]\nIn 1978, Fred Rwigyema returned to western Uganda and reunited with Kagame.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=19}} During his absence, Rwigyema had joined the rebel army of [[Yoweri Museveni]].

Museveni disputed the result, and he and his followers withdrew from the new government in protest. In 1981, Museveni formed the rebel [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA); Kagame and Rwigyema joined as founding soldiers, along with thirty-eight Ugandans.{{sfn|Associated Press (I)|1981}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=39}} The army's goal was to overthrow Obote's government, in what became known as the Ugandan Bush War.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=39}}{{sfn|Nganda|2009}}\n\nKagame and Rwigyema joined the NRA primarily to ease conditions for Rwandan refugees persecuted by Obote.

These include honorary degrees from the American [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]],{{sfn|University of the Pacific|2010}} [[Oklahoma Christian University]],{{sfn|Oklahoma Christian University}} and the [[University of Glasgow]],{{sfn|University of Glasgow|2007}} the [[Andrew Young]] Medal for Capitalism and Social Progress by [[Georgia State University]],{{sfn|Columbia University}} and a [[Clinton Global Citizen Award]].{{sfn|Nambi|2009}} Kagame has also received the highest awards bestowed by the countries of [[Liberia]] and [[Benin]], the [[Order of the Pioneers of Liberia|Distinction of the Grand Cordon in the Most Venerable Order of the Knighthood of Pioneers]],{{sfn|New Times (III)|2009}} and the [[National Order of Benin|Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit]]{{sfn|New Times (IV)|2010}} respectively. In September 2010, the British political magazine ''[[New Statesman]]'' named Kagame one of its 50 most influential figures for that year, placing him in 49th place.{{sfn|New Statesman|2010}} The

Meanwhile, Peter and Lois decide to participate in the Quahog community talent show with a [[folk music|folk singing]] act, as they did in the 1980s, but the couple becomes largely reliant on [[marijuana]] for inspiration and eventually fail the competition for their poor performance, despite their beliefs they were singing well when under the influence of the drugs.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074gbk|title=Deep Throats|accessdate=2008-04-12|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Meg Griffin|Meg]] is employed as an intern for [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]] after doing an interview with him. The family is impressed by this news, and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] feels pressured that he is becoming the \"new Meg\" due to him not having a job. Brian decides to become a [[taxicab driver]], but soon becomes intent on exposing the corruption of Mayor West after receiving a $400 parking ticket for parking his taxi in a handicapped zone. When discussing his corruption beliefs with Meg, she argues that Mayor West is a nice person and that Brian should drop it. [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], after learning of Brian's intentions, decides to help. After meeting in a parking lot with a whistleblower, [[Kermit the Frog]], Brian discovers where Mayor West will be that night, and follows him to a motel with Stewie.\n\nSpying on West through the motel wall, they discover he's in a romantic relationship with Meg. Seeing this as an ideal opportunity to take West down, Brian photographs the two together in romantic scenes and threatens to reveal them to the press. After Meg finds out, she confronts West, who says he and Meg should separate due to the negative press which will follow - because even though he's used to it, he does not want Meg's life to be ruined, stating how much he really cares about her. They separate, with Mayor West telling Meg that even though he's leaving her, he'll always love her. Brian, having secretly heard this, realizes he has made a mistake, destroys the images, and apologizes to Meg that he lost sight of what was really important. His taxicab, however, is destroyed by [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]], believing Brian refused to give him a ride.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter and Lois decide to participate in a community [[talent show]] with a [[folk music|folk-singing]] act they did in the 1980s. They have a hard time, however, writing new songs and start to smoke [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] for inspiration, annoying the family. At one point, Peter eats a piece of his guitar, and him and Lois lie on the sofa naked in front of Brian and Stewie. At the show, they initially appear to wow the entire crowd with their performance, but, later, they realize that they lost. [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] explains that they were completely high and they just shouted \"Aah!\" to the crowd while plodding chords on the guitar and he then preaches the dangers of marijuana to Lois and Peter.\n\n==Production==\nIt was originally intended for [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]] to beat Meg up when she is applying for a job within his office, but the scene was never used.<ref name=\"Colton\">{{cite video | people=Colton, Greg|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Deep Throats\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The clay cars sketch was not animated by the regular show producers, rather it was drawn by Eileen Colehep, a woman who attended college with show producer [[Seth MacFarlane]].<ref name=\"MacFarlane\">{{cite video | people=MacFarlane, Seth|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Deep Throats\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The voice of [[List of Family Guy characters#Citizens of Quahog|Bruce the performance artist]] was performed by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]], and was originally scheduled to last longer,<ref name=\"Borstein\">{{cite video | people=Borstein, Alex|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Deep Throats\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name=\"Kunis\">{{cite video | people=Kunis, Mila|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Deep Throats\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> but it was reduced for unknown reasons.<ref name=\"Colton\"/> The concept behind the storyline of Peter and Lois performing in [[Public house|pubs]] when they were younger relates to MacFarlane's father, who used to do stage performances in bars.

The meeting itself is a reference to the meeting with Deep Throat or to the [[1976 in film|1976]] film ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]''.

The scene where Cleveland runs off as a black panther when he notices Meg and Brian looking at him as he destroys Brian's cab with a crowbar is a reference to [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Black or White]]\" second ending known as the Black or White Panther Dance. Stewie references his cousin, [[Tom Cruise|Stewie Cruise]], showing him jumping up and down on [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]]'s couch while shouting \"I'm in love with [[Katie Holmes]]! I'm not gay!\" When Lois mentions to Peter that it would be fun to be in the community talent show, Stewie says \"You know what else is fun? Watching ''[[Mr. Belvedere]]'' without people talking so loudly!\". He then proceeds to sing the theme song loudly. When Peter is being driven around by Brian, he refers to him as Bitterman, a reference to the chauffeur in the 1981 film ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]''. The song Mayor West and Meg are listening to in the hotel together is the theme song to ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' from the 1987 series.

It was written by [[Alex Borstein]] and directed by Greg Colton. Appalled at parking charges introduced by [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]], [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] decides to expose the corruption of the Mayor, despite the prospect of potentially destroying [[Meg Griffin|Meg]]'s new career as the Mayor's intern. Meanwhile, Peter and Lois decide to participate in the Quahog community talent show with a [[folk music|folk singing]] act, as they did in the 1980s, but the couple becomes largely reliant on [[marijuana]] for inspiration and eventually fail the competition for their poor performance, despite their beliefs they were singing well when under the influence of the drugs.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074gbk|title=Deep Throats|accessdate=2008-04-12|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Meg Griffin|Meg]] is employed as an intern for [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]] after doing an interview with him. The family is impressed by this news, and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] feels pressured that he is becoming the \"new Meg\" due to him not having a job. Brian decides to become a [[taxicab driver]], but soon becomes intent on exposing the corruption of Mayor West after receiving a $400 parking ticket for parking his taxi in a handicapped zone. When discussing his corruption beliefs with Meg, she argues that Mayor West is a nice person and that Brian should drop it. [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], after learning of Brian's intentions, decides to help. After meeting in a parking lot with a whistleblower, [[Kermit the Frog]], Brian discovers where Mayor West will be that night, and follows him to a motel with Stewie.\n\nSpying on West through the motel wall, they discover he's in a romantic relationship with Meg. Seeing this as an ideal opportunity to take West down, Brian photographs the two together in romantic scenes and threatens to reveal them to the press. After Meg finds out, she confronts West, who says he and Meg should separate due to the negative press which will follow - because even though he's used to it, he does not want Meg's life to be ruined, stating how much he really cares about her. They separate, with Mayor West telling Meg that even though he's leaving her, he'll always love her. Brian, having secretly heard this, realizes he has made a mistake, destroys the images, and apologizes to Meg that he lost sight of what was really important. His taxicab, however, is destroyed by [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]], believing Brian refused to give him a ride.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter and Lois decide to participate in a community [[talent show]] with a [[folk music|folk-singing]] act they did in the 1980s. They have a hard time, however, writing new songs and start to smoke [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] for inspiration, annoying the family. At one point, Peter eats a piece of his guitar, and him and Lois lie on the sofa naked in front of Brian and Stewie. At the show, they initially appear to wow the entire crowd with their performance, but, later, they realize that they lost. [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] explains that they were completely high and they just shouted \"Aah!\" to the crowd while plodding chords on the guitar and he then preaches the dangers of marijuana to Lois and Peter.\n\n==Production==\nIt was originally intended for [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]] to beat Meg up when she is applying for a job within his office, but the scene was never used.<ref name=\"Colton\">{{cite video | people=Colton, Greg|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Deep Throats\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The clay cars sketch was not animated by the regular show producers, rather it was drawn by Eileen Colehep, a woman who attended college with show producer [[Seth MacFarlane]].<ref name=\"MacFarlane\">{{cite video | people=MacFarlane, Seth|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Deep Throats\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The voice of [[List of Family Guy characters#Citizens of Quahog|Bruce the performance artist]] was performed by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]], and was originally scheduled to last longer,<ref name=\"Borstein\">{{cite video | people=Borstein, Alex|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Deep Throats\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name=\"Kunis\">{{cite video | people=Kunis, Mila|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Deep Throats\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> but it was reduced for unknown reasons.<ref name=\"Colton\"/> The concept behind the storyline of Peter and Lois performing in [[Public house|pubs]] when they were younger relates to MacFarlane's father, who used to do stage performances in bars.

The episode features [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] after he is struck by lightning, and has a [[near-death experience]], which involves him going back in time, and realizing his love for his wife, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], who he had ditched to play golf on their anniversary. Peter soon realizes his mistakes, and attempts to repair his relationship with his wife.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]] and directed by [[Rob Renzetti]]. The episode featured guest performances by [[Adam Carolla]], [[Laura Silverman]], [[Peter Frampton]], and [[Estelle Harris]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series.\n\n==Plot==\nOn their wedding anniversary, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] is invited by Quagmire to play at Barrington, an extremely exclusive [[golf course]], so he sends [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] on a [[scavenger hunt]] to stall his family. Playing golf, he is struck by [[lightning]] and has a [[near-death experience]]. It is then he meets [[Death (Family Guy)|Death]] again (for the first time since his debut), who tries to show Peter that his marriage is in trouble and, to a greater extent, his life (Death tells Peter he dies 2 years after Lois divorces him); in exchange, Peter helps Death get a date with a pet shop clerk named Amy.\n\nDeath takes Peter back in time to his courtship of Lois. Peter did not make a good impression on Lois's father, [[List of Family Guy characters#Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter Pewterschmidt]], who knocked Peter out with an early [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] statue and had his servants give him a [[death flight]]. He was rescued by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] ship on which [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] was serving. Peter enjoys a rousing musical number performed by Quagmire and his shipmates. Back ashore, Peter gets a ride with [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] back to [[Rhode Island]]. Cleveland's vehicle is a van tricked out for [[seduction]]. They are pursued by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] whom Peter mistakes for [[ghost]]s, a reference to ''[[Mississippi Burning]]''.\n\nPeter gets back to the Pewterschmidts' house, but is chased by a guard dog and ends up rolling into Carter's private sauna. He explains he wants to marry Lois, and Carter offers Peter one million dollars to stay away from her. Peter tears up the check, declaring Lois \"worthless\". Lois, who has heard (and understood that he actually meant to say \"priceless\"), comes in to thank Peter.\n\nDeath manages to score a date with Amy by talking to her outside of the shop. Peter realizes that he has not appreciated his wife as much recently and, once he's back in his body, he asks Death to pay a visit to [[Peter Frampton]]. When Death arrives at Frampton's house, he asks him to bring his [[guitar]] and [[talkbox|\"that thing that makes it go \u2018wah wah wah'\"]]. Lois discovers Peter at the golf course and prepares to confront him, but Frampton appears, playing \"[[Baby, I Love Your Way]]\", which is \"their\" song, which they heard when they were making out on the road when they first met (played on the radio of the truck that crashed avoiding them). Peter presents this as his anniversary gift to her. Lois is deeply moved, asking Peter how he thought of all this; Peter responds by saying he had help from \"a very special friend\".\n\nAt the end of the episode, however, Death does not enjoy his date with Amy, as she harps on about animal rights.
