Blazer, Vice Counselor and Head of Chancery of Switzerland in India brought Khajjiar on the world tourism map by calling it \"Mini Switzerland\". He also put a sign of a yellow Swiss hiking footpath showing Khajjiar's distance from the Swiss capital [[Berne]]: \"{{cvt|6194|km|mi|disp=x|\" or }}.

Bus service to and from Khajjiar is limited and timing changes according to local demands.<ref name=Himchal/>\n\n==Places of interest==\nThe best entertainment in Khajjiar is to walk around the lake or to go for long walks in the thick pine forests. In winter there is snow which can be up to {{cvt|3|ft|order=flip}} of height. Children enjoy this place because of the freedom of movement and the sloped terrain which permits them to roll down to the lake without getting hurt. Another attraction is horse riding. There is a huge Hanuman Statue and a park.<ref name=Himchal/>\n\n===Dauladhar mountains===\nDense deodars, pines and lush green meadows are characteristic of Khajjiar.

The dense growth of weed called [[Acorus calamus|vacha]] has made its earth spongy. Now the banks stand covered by a thick layer of earth, formed by the years of dust settling down on the weeds.\n\n===Khajji Nag temple===\nA little away from the lake is the temple of Khajji Nag belonging to the 12th century AD made by the king of chamba Prithvi Singh. The temple has a golden dome due to which it is also known as Golden Devi Temple. In the ''[[mandapa]]'' of the temple one can see the images of the Pandavas and the defeated Kaurvas hanging from the roof of the circumambulatory path. The sanctum of the temple has been beautifully carved from wood.<ref name=Himchal/> This temple is dedicated to snake ([[N\u0101ga]]) worship and there are some snake idols inside. The temple also has idols of [[Shiva]] and Goddess Hadimba.\n\n==Trekking==\nKhajjiar offers numerous trekking opportunities. Khajjiar to Dainkund is a 3.5 kilometre easy to moderate trek. The trek starts 6 kilometres from Khajjiar on the Dalhousie-Khajjiar road and ends at Pholani Devi Temple at Dainkund.

In June 2006, an updated patch was released for the 10.4.7 {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} update for non-Apple computers using the 10.4.4 kernel.\n\nUp to the release of the 10.4.8 update, all OSx86 patches used the 10.4.4 kernel with the rest of the operating system at version 10.4.8. However, the newer frameworks relied on the newer kernels and this led to users of 10.4.8 encountering many problems. Apple also started making more use of [[SSE3]] instructions on their hardware making it even more difficult for users with CPUs supporting only SSE2 (such as older [[Pentium 4]]s) to get a fully compatible system running. To solve this problem, hackers from the community released kernels where those instructions were emulated with [[SSE2]] equivalents, although this produced a performance penalty.\n\nThroughout the years, many \"[[Software distro|distro]]s\" were released for download over the Internet. These distros were copies of the Mac OS X installer disc modified to include additional components necessary to make the OS run on the non-Apple hardware. A prominent member of the community, JaS, released many distros of Mac OS X Tiger containing patched kernels. Some other popular distros are iATKOS, Kalyway, iPC, iDeneb, and. Distros have fallen out of favour as the OSx86 community grew, as new bootloaders were developed that made it possible to use actual copies of the OS X Installer.\n\n=== OS X Leopard (10.5) ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[Image:Hackintosh Laptop.jpg|thumb|Mac OS X v10.5 installing on a [[Lenovo]] laptop computer.]]\n\nAs early as {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} v10.5 build 9A466 the community has maintained a version of Leopard that can run on non-Apple hardware. A hacker by the handle of BrazilMac created one of the earliest patching processes that made it convenient for users to install {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} onto 3rd party hardware by using a legally obtained, retail version of Apple {{nowrap|Mac OS X}}.  This simplification made the BrazilMac patch and its later revisions quickly the most popular choice for many distros.  Five of the most popular builds go by the name JaS, Kalyway, iATKOS, iPC and iDeneb - although more recently these builds are on the way out as the Boot-132 method (described below) gains popularity.  However, all of these compilations rely on the work of kernel hackers made by Lorem (build 9A466), SynthetiX (builds 9A499, 9A527 and 9A559), ToH (builds 9A581, 9B13 and 9B18) and more recently a group calling themselves StageXNU (now called Voodoo) (Darwin 9.4.0). Their contributions trickled down into the various Mac OSx86 installers, readily available on the Internet. They continue to be refined and updated builds released, not just to maintain compatibility with Apple releases but an ever-increasing number of third-party components.  The OSx86 community has been quick to make the necessary modifications to enable Apple's latest releases to run on non-Apple hardware. Within hours of Leopard's release, an AMD/Intel SSE2/3 Kernel Patcher was created that removed the [[HPET]] requirement from an original untouched mach_kernel file, a core component of the Mac OS.\n\n=== OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) ===\n\nWhen \"Snow Leopard\" was released, Russian hacker netkas created a version of Chameleon that can boot Mac OS X v10.6. The main problem was that many people were forced to modify DSDT or use kexts due to some specific issues. As soon as possible modbin and dmitrik released test versions of kernel that allow to boot Snow Leopard on AMD machines. Stable XNU kernels for v10.6 were released by Qoopz and Pcj. There are some popular builds based on Retail by the name Universal (Intel only), Hazard, and iAtkos. Since v10.6.2 Nawcom, Qoopz, and Andy Vandijck have been working on Legacy kernel for unsupported CPUs.\n\n=== OS X Lion (10.7) ===\nWhen Apple released the Developer Preview 1, a Russian Hackintosh developer usr-sse2 was the first who created a method to install Lion. The method consists of deploying Mac OS X v10.7 image on a flash drive, and booting from it via XPC UEFI Bootloader (See [[OSx86#DUET|DUET]] below). After some changes were made to the Chameleon source code, it became possible to boot Lion with an updated version of Chameleon. After a while Dmitrik also known as Bronzovka had luck with creating a kernel that supported AMD systems; after a few months (10.7.3 V2 With AMD Support) and iAtkos L2 (10.7.2 Only Intel) were released.\n<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.hackintoshzone.com/files/28-nireshs-mac-os-x-1073-v2-with-amd-support/\n|title=Niresh's Mac OS X 10.7.3 V2 With AMD Support Version V2\n|date=4 December 2013\n|accessdate=2011-04-24\n}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) ===\nShortly after the release of Developer Preview 1, some unknown developers managed to install this version of OS X to their PC by using a modified version of the Chameleon Bootloader. This version was released via the main project starting at version r1997<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chameleon.osx86.hu/|title=Chameleon r1997 Mountain Lion}}</ref> to the general public. Due to the problems sourced during the Lion era,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} other ways of installing and required patches were never made public, which leaves the scene in an unknown state towards Mountain Lion.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nSince the retail release of Mountain Lion several users have reported successful setups using installers purchased from the [[Mac App Store]], along with updated versions of Chameleon and other tools including distros.\nNiresh's Distro (10.8 Intel only)  was first released and then was updated to 10.8.2 (With AMD and Intel) and 10.8.5 (With UEFI Support, AMD and Intel Support) versions; iAtkos ML2 was released after Niresh's Release.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.tonymacx86.com/61-unibeast-install-os-x-mountain-lion-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html\n|title=UniBeast: Install OS X Mountain Lion on Any Supported Intel-based PC\n|date=14 August 2012\n|accessdate=2013-03-20\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/07/install-mountain-lion-unibeast.html\n|title=How to install OS X Mountain Lion on your PC with Unibeast\n|date=25 July 2012\n|accessdate=2013-03-20\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.hackintoshzone.com/files/file/76-niresh-mountain-lion-1085-dvd-iso-image-with-amd-intel/\n|title=Niresh Mountain Lion 10.8.5 DvD ISO Image - With AMD & Intel\n|date=9 December 2013\n|accessdate=2020-03-07\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.macbreaker.com/2013/04/install-mountain-lion-hackintosh-niresh.html\n|title=How to install OS X Mountain Lion on your PC with Niresh\n|date=15 April 2012\n|accessdate=2013-04-20\n}}</ref>\n\n=== OS X Mavericks (10.9) ===\nMultiple new kernels for Hackintosh 10.9 are in the works, although there still are minor issues with most of them. Most of these kernels aim to allow users to run Mavericks on AMD and older Intel CPUs, which lack certain instruction sets of the latest Intel CPUs. Significant efforts have been made to emulate instruction sets like [[SSSE3]], which are not present on AMD K10-based CPUs, and older Intel CPUs, like the Intel Core Duo.\nAMD's latest CPUs, from the '[[Bulldozer (microarchitecture)|Bulldozer]]' architecture onwards, contain almost all the latest instruction sets, and hence, some kernels with full [[SSE4]] support have also been released. After two months, Niresh's Distro was released for Mavericks, which supports AMD CPUs and latest Intel CPUs. It also has a custom kernel that allows Intel Atom processors to boot into Mavericks. Niresh's was the only free distro that was released for Mavericks, since the iAtkos Team decided to release their Mavericks distro for specific hardware on donation basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hackintoshosx.com/files/file/3736-amd-10910911092-kernel-update-iii-with-full-sse4-support/|title=AMD 10.9/10.9.1/10.9.2 kernel    UPDATE III     with full sse4 support|website=osx86.net}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hackintoshzone.com/files/75-hackintosh-mavericks/|title=Hackintosh Mavericks - Hackintosh ISO (Hackintosh Distro) - HackintoshZone|website=HackintoshZone}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== OS X Yosemite (10.10) ===\nAfter the initial release of OS X Yosemite 10.10 BETA, various developers took on the role of updating their bootloaders for the system. Members of OSx86 forum Insanelymac set to update the EFI Bootloader Chameleon for this new OS release. Some time later, Niresh (an independent OSx86 developer) released a standalone tool known as Yosemite Zone, which would automatically install the new OS and other various features on a non-Apple device with minimal input. This method consisted of [[BitTorrent|torrenting]] an OS X 10.10 DMG onto a USB flash drive with MacPwn Vanilla Installation. Unibeast was updated to support Yosemite,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/unibeast-install-os-x-yosemite-on-any-supported-intel-based-pc.143976/|title=UniBeast: Install OS X Yosemite on Any Supported Intel-based PC|publisher=}}</ref> and a distribution of Yosemite Zone was released with AMD processor support.\nA vanilla installation of Yosemite is possible via Insanelymac's Pandora Box Beta 2.0 and UniBeast.

Since this method generally does not require copying or modification of macOS, it is considered{{by whom|date=August 2014}} to be the legal way of installing macOS on non-Apple computers (despite being untested in courts).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe work started with EFI emulation in the form of David Elliot (dfe)'s modified version of Boot-132 called \"Darwin/x86\", which has a \"FakeEFI\" system that emulates EFI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tgwbd.org/darwin/boot.html |title=Darwin/x86 Boot Loader |website=Tgwbd.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> In early November 2007, a group of hackers (fronted by a Russian hacker known as Netkas), using Elliot's code, developed a method<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://netkas.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2007/11/05/w00t.html |title=netkas.org :: W00t - released<!-- '''reflinks''' title --> |access-date=2007-11-16 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65oGQUi4Y?url=http://netkas.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2007/11/05/w00t.html |archive-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> of emulating an EFI environment using a specially modified Darwin bootloader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tgwbd.org/darwin/boot.html |title=Darwin/x86 Boot Loader |website=Tgwbd.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> In practical terms, this meant that regular PCs meeting a minimum set of hardware requirements could now be \"seen\" as real Macintosh computers by the OS, allowing the use of unmodified, \"stock\" Apple kernels (as long as the CPU supports it) and thus giving a more transparent and reliable operation. Several methods for real world deployment of this innovative solution have arisen around the Internet. An explanation of this achievement along with a usage guide was provided by the website DigitMemo.com.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitmemo.com/articles/734/howto-install-efi-patch-and-enable-vanilla-os-x-kernel-in-hackintosh/ |title=HowTo: Install EFI patch and Use Unmodified OS X Kernel in Hackintosh |website=Digitmemo.com |date= |access-date=2009-04-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524052648/http://www.digitmemo.com/articles/734/howto-install-efi-patch-and-enable-vanilla-os-x-kernel-in-hackintosh/ |archive-date=2009-05-24 |df= }}</ref>\n\nTrue EFI emulation was a highly sought after asset for the OSx86 community. Previous efforts based upon Apple's open source Darwin Project and Hackintosh gurus allowed users to use macOS on normal PCs, with patched kernels/kernel modules that simply bypassed EFI. Using the EFI patch, a Hackintosh could boot off \"[[Vanilla software|vanilla]]\" (unmodified) macOS kernels and use vanilla kernel extensions.  This not only allowed the system to be compatible with future system updates, but also offered increased stability. This method also circumvents one aspect of Apple's End User License Agreement, which states that the modification of non-Open Source components of the OS is forbidden.<ref name=\"EULA\" />\n\nIn mid-2008, a new commercial product, EFi-X, was released that claims to allow full, simple booting off official Leopard install disks, and a subsequent install, without any patching required, but this is possibly a repackaging of Boot-132 technology in a [[USB]]-attached device.<ref>{{cite web|first=Tuan |last=Nguyen |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/asem-efix-mac-chameleon,8617.html |title=Exclusive Report: EFI-X Mac Booter, A Scam? |website=Tomshardware.com |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref> [[Rebel EFI]] is another commercial product that also seems to use Open Source software.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netkas.org/?p=299|title=netkas.org \u00bb Enjoy|website=netkas.org}}</ref>\n\nIt was thought{{by whom|date=August 2014}} that Windows 7's support of EFI would result in PC motherboards replacing BIOS with EFI. MSI announced the Efinity mainboard in early 2008. As of 2011, EFI-based computers have entered the market, however none can natively boot Mac OS X due to the lack of a [[HFS+]] driver in the EFI implementation.\n\n==== Boot-132 ====\n\nBoot-132 is a bootloader provided by Apple for loading the XNU kernel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/Boot-132|title=Boot-132|accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref> In mid-2008, a new modified BOOT-132 came on to the scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=113288|title=New modified Boot-132 allows you to boot retail DVDs|date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref> This method allows users to conduct the Leopard-based OSx86 installation using a stock, retail-purchased copy of {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} Leopard and eradicates the necessity of a hacked installation like JaS or Kalyway (mentioned previously).  The Boot-132 bootloader essentially preloads an environment on the system from which Leopard can boot and operate. The bootloader stores the necessary files (kext files) in a .img collection or simply a folder. The luxury of this new installation method includes the ability to boot and install from a retail Leopard DVD and update straight from Apple without breaking the DMCA. The only possible problem here is that it breaks the macOS EULA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/21564/Building_a_Hackintosh_Apple_Can_t_Sue_You_For|title=Building a Hackintosh Apple Can't Sue You For|accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref>\n\nThe bootloader behaves like the [[Linux]] kernel: one can use an mboot-compatible (a patched [[syslinux]] was used for the hack) bootloader that tells boot-dfe about the .img file (the [[ramdisk]] or [[initrd]], as it's known by Linux users), and boot-dfe will then use the kexts (or mkext) from it. This new boot-dfe has been tested with the retail Leopard DVD, and it can boot, install, run Leopard without having to build a modified DVD.\n\n==== Chameleon ====\nSince the early developer builds of Mac OS X v10.6, members of the OSx86 community had been booting the new operating system using yet another bootloader called PC EFI provided by Russian hacker Netkas or the bootloader of the Voodoo team's Chameleon. Chameleon is based on David Elliot's Boot-132. The bootloader supports ACPI, SMBIOS, graphics, ethernet, and some other injections. It allows to boot up macOS on non-Macintosh hardware. Chameleon supports a lot of AMD as well as Nvidia graphics cards. There are a lot of forks of it by different developers; the latest version upstream is 2.2 from 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chameleon: Bring Mac OS X Developers Together |url=http://chameleon.osx86.hu/ |website=chameleon.osx86.hu |accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Clover====\nClover is a GUI bootloader for multiple operating systems that supports either UEFI or the legacy BIOS mode. To support booting EFI code, one of the two methods are conventionally taken: either Elliot's FakeEFI was used, or an actual open-source EFI system based on Intel's [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface#Intel EFI|TianoCore]] called DUET (Developer's UEFI Emulation) was flashed into the motherboard.<ref>{{cite web |title=A BIOS to UEFI Transformation |url=http://www.rodsbooks.com/bios2uefi/ |website=www.rodsbooks.com}}</ref> However, modern, non-Apple EFI firmware as well as Duet cannot directly load macOS due to various incompatibilities, mainly around the HFS+ file system but also due to the quirks of individual vendors. One more step was needed to load macOS systems: an EFI application to rectify these problems and bridge the gap.\n\nBeginning in March 2011, Slice discussed his idea with other community members, resulting in the development of a bootloader that can do both: emulate an EFI firmware of one's choice or use a Real UEFI firmware to boot Mac OS X. It contains EFI applications and drivers for correctly reading an HFS+ disk and patching EFI tables to prepare the system for starting macOS. As of 2020, it is actively maintained.<ref>{{cite web |title=Clover EFI bootloader |url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/ |website=SourceForge |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== OpenCore ====\nOpenCore, started in 2019, is another bootloader developed to run macOS on UEFI or BIOS systems as well as old Mac devices that are no longer supported.<ref>{{cite web |title=acidanthera/OpenCorePkg |url=https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg |website=GitHub |publisher=Acidanthera |date=8 March 2020}}</ref> Compared to Clover, it is said to provide overall better patching and emulation as well as a faster boot time. The project has also taken over the development of some patches, meaning future versions may only work with OpenCore.<ref>{{cite web |title=OpenCore Vanilla Guide |url=https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/ |website=khronokernel-2.gitbook.io}}</ref>\n\n===Live DVD===\nIn March 2007, the OSx86 community made some significant progress with the development of a [[Live DVD]]. The Live DVD allows booting to a working system with Mac OS X v10.4.8.\n\nOn January 2, 2009, InsanelyMac's Live DVD team published a new method by which a Mac OS X v10.5.x Live DVD could be produced, allowing users to boot a fully working macOS desktop from a DVD or USB flash drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=144128&st=0h |title=2009 Live DVD, how to make a simple, working osx livedvd |website=Insanelymac.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref>  The method was more reliable than previous methods because it manipulated Apple's existing Netboot and Imageboot functionalities and behaved as if the system were running off a network disk. It was easier to produce; requiring only a single script to be added to an existing installation. Distributions of the live DVD have been made since its inception. Since then, it is notable that this method has been shown to work on normal Apple Mac hardware.\n\n===Virtual machine===\nIt is possible to run macOS as a [[virtual machine]] inside other operating systems installed on standard PC hardware by using [[virtualization]] software such as [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle's]] [[VirtualBox]]<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Run Mac OS X in VirtualBox on Windows|url=http://lifehacker.com/5583650/run-mac-os-x-in-virtualbox-on-windows}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How to Install Mac OS X Snow Leopard in VirtualBox on Windows 7|url=http://www.redmondpie.com/how-to-install-mac-os-x-snow-leopard-in-virtualbox-on-windows-7/}}</ref> (though this is not officially supported by Oracle<ref>{{cite web|title=Important notice regarding Mac OS X as Guest|url=http://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=31104}}</ref>).

In June 2006, an updated patch was released for the 10.4.7 {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} update for non-Apple computers using the 10.4.4 kernel.\n\nUp to the release of the 10.4.8 update, all OSx86 patches used the 10.4.4 kernel with the rest of the operating system at version 10.4.8. However, the newer frameworks relied on the newer kernels and this led to users of 10.4.8 encountering many problems. Apple also started making more use of [[SSE3]] instructions on their hardware making it even more difficult for users with CPUs supporting only SSE2 (such as older [[Pentium 4]]s) to get a fully compatible system running. To solve this problem, hackers from the community released kernels where those instructions were emulated with [[SSE2]] equivalents, although this produced a performance penalty.\n\nThroughout the years, many \"[[Software distro|distro]]s\" were released for download over the Internet. These distros were copies of the Mac OS X installer disc modified to include additional components necessary to make the OS run on the non-Apple hardware. A prominent member of the community, JaS, released many distros of Mac OS X Tiger containing patched kernels. Some other popular distros are iATKOS, Kalyway, iPC, iDeneb, and. Distros have fallen out of favour as the OSx86 community grew, as new bootloaders were developed that made it possible to use actual copies of the OS X Installer.\n\n=== OS X Leopard (10.5) ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[Image:Hackintosh Laptop.jpg|thumb|Mac OS X v10.5 installing on a [[Lenovo]] laptop computer.]]\n\nAs early as {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} v10.5 build 9A466 the community has maintained a version of Leopard that can run on non-Apple hardware. A hacker by the handle of BrazilMac created one of the earliest patching processes that made it convenient for users to install {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} onto 3rd party hardware by using a legally obtained, retail version of Apple {{nowrap|Mac OS X}}.  This simplification made the BrazilMac patch and its later revisions quickly the most popular choice for many distros.  Five of the most popular builds go by the name JaS, Kalyway, iATKOS, iPC and iDeneb - although more recently these builds are on the way out as the Boot-132 method (described below) gains popularity.  However, all of these compilations rely on the work of kernel hackers made by Lorem (build 9A466), SynthetiX (builds 9A499, 9A527 and 9A559), ToH (builds 9A581, 9B13 and 9B18) and more recently a group calling themselves StageXNU (now called Voodoo) (Darwin 9.4.0). Their contributions trickled down into the various Mac OSx86 installers, readily available on the Internet. They continue to be refined and updated builds released, not just to maintain compatibility with Apple releases but an ever-increasing number of third-party components.  The OSx86 community has been quick to make the necessary modifications to enable Apple's latest releases to run on non-Apple hardware. Within hours of Leopard's release, an AMD/Intel SSE2/3 Kernel Patcher was created that removed the [[HPET]] requirement from an original untouched mach_kernel file, a core component of the Mac OS.\n\n=== OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) ===\n\nWhen \"Snow Leopard\" was released, Russian hacker netkas created a version of Chameleon that can boot Mac OS X v10.6. The main problem was that many people were forced to modify DSDT or use kexts due to some specific issues. As soon as possible modbin and dmitrik released test versions of kernel that allow to boot Snow Leopard on AMD machines. Stable XNU kernels for v10.6 were released by Qoopz and Pcj. There are some popular builds based on Retail by the name Universal (Intel only), Hazard, and iAtkos. Since v10.6.2 Nawcom, Qoopz, and Andy Vandijck have been working on Legacy kernel for unsupported CPUs.\n\n=== OS X Lion (10.7) ===\nWhen Apple released the Developer Preview 1, a Russian Hackintosh developer usr-sse2 was the first who created a method to install Lion. The method consists of deploying Mac OS X v10.7 image on a flash drive, and booting from it via XPC UEFI Bootloader (See [[OSx86#DUET|DUET]] below). After some changes were made to the Chameleon source code, it became possible to boot Lion with an updated version of Chameleon. After a while Dmitrik also known as Bronzovka had luck with creating a kernel that supported AMD systems; after a few months (10.7.3 V2 With AMD Support) and iAtkos L2 (10.7.2 Only Intel) were released.\n<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.hackintoshzone.com/files/28-nireshs-mac-os-x-1073-v2-with-amd-support/\n|title=Niresh's Mac OS X 10.7.3 V2 With AMD Support Version V2\n|date=4 December 2013\n|accessdate=2011-04-24\n}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) ===\nShortly after the release of Developer Preview 1, some unknown developers managed to install this version of OS X to their PC by using a modified version of the Chameleon Bootloader.

Significant efforts have been made to emulate instruction sets like [[SSSE3]], which are not present on AMD K10-based CPUs, and older Intel CPUs, like the Intel Core Duo.\nAMD's latest CPUs, from the '[[Bulldozer (microarchitecture)|Bulldozer]]' architecture onwards, contain almost all the latest instruction sets, and hence, some kernels with full [[SSE4]] support have also been released. After two months, Niresh's Distro was released for Mavericks, which supports AMD CPUs and latest Intel CPUs. It also has a custom kernel that allows Intel Atom processors to boot into Mavericks. Niresh's was the only free distro that was released for Mavericks, since the iAtkos Team decided to release their Mavericks distro for specific hardware on donation basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hackintoshosx.com/files/file/3736-amd-10910911092-kernel-update-iii-with-full-sse4-support/|title=AMD 10.9/10.9.1/10.9.2 kernel    UPDATE III     with full sse4 support|website=osx86.net}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hackintoshzone.com/files/75-hackintosh-mavericks/|title=Hackintosh Mavericks - Hackintosh ISO (Hackintosh Distro) - HackintoshZone|website=HackintoshZone}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== OS X Yosemite (10.10) ===\nAfter the initial release of OS X Yosemite 10.10 BETA, various developers took on the role of updating their bootloaders for the system.

Efforts were also made to emulate the [[SSSE3]] instruction set for processors that did not support it. The kernel used by OS X Mavericks made use of SSSE3 instructions, requiring those patches.\n\n===Boot loaders and emulators===\n\n==== EFI emulation ====\n\n[[Extensible Firmware Interface]] (EFI) is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. Since this method generally does not require copying or modification of macOS, it is considered{{by whom|date=August 2014}} to be the legal way of installing macOS on non-Apple computers (despite being untested in courts).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe work started with EFI emulation in the form of David Elliot (dfe)'s modified version of Boot-132 called \"Darwin/x86\", which has a \"FakeEFI\" system that emulates EFI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tgwbd.org/darwin/boot.html |title=Darwin/x86 Boot Loader |website=Tgwbd.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> In early November 2007, a group of hackers (fronted by a Russian hacker known as Netkas), using Elliot's code, developed a method<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://netkas.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2007/11/05/w00t.html |title=netkas.org :: W00t - released<!-- '''reflinks''' title --> |access-date=2007-11-16 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65oGQUi4Y?url=http://netkas.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2007/11/05/w00t.html |archive-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> of emulating an EFI environment using a specially modified Darwin bootloader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tgwbd.org/darwin/boot.html |title=Darwin/x86 Boot Loader |website=Tgwbd.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> In practical terms, this meant that regular PCs meeting a minimum set of hardware requirements could now be \"seen\" as real Macintosh computers by the OS, allowing the use of unmodified, \"stock\" Apple kernels (as long as the CPU supports it) and thus giving a more transparent and reliable operation. Several methods for real world deployment of this innovative solution have arisen around the Internet. An explanation of this achievement along with a usage guide was provided by the website DigitMemo.com.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitmemo.com/articles/734/howto-install-efi-patch-and-enable-vanilla-os-x-kernel-in-hackintosh/ |title=HowTo: Install EFI patch and Use Unmodified OS X Kernel in Hackintosh |website=Digitmemo.com |date= |access-date=2009-04-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524052648/http://www.digitmemo.com/articles/734/howto-install-efi-patch-and-enable-vanilla-os-x-kernel-in-hackintosh/ |archive-date=2009-05-24 |df= }}</ref>\n\nTrue EFI emulation was a highly sought after asset for the OSx86 community. Previous efforts based upon Apple's open source Darwin Project and Hackintosh gurus allowed users to use macOS on normal PCs, with patched kernels/kernel modules that simply bypassed EFI. Using the EFI patch, a Hackintosh could boot off \"[[Vanilla software|vanilla]]\" (unmodified) macOS kernels and use vanilla kernel extensions.  This not only allowed the system to be compatible with future system updates, but also offered increased stability. This method also circumvents one aspect of Apple's End User License Agreement, which states that the modification of non-Open Source components of the OS is forbidden.<ref name=\"EULA\" />\n\nIn mid-2008, a new commercial product, EFi-X, was released that claims to allow full, simple booting off official Leopard install disks, and a subsequent install, without any patching required, but this is possibly a repackaging of Boot-132 technology in a [[USB]]-attached device.<ref>{{cite web|first=Tuan |last=Nguyen |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/asem-efix-mac-chameleon,8617.html |title=Exclusive Report: EFI-X Mac Booter, A Scam? |website=Tomshardware.com |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref> [[Rebel EFI]] is another commercial product that also seems to use Open Source software.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netkas.org/?p=299|title=netkas.org \u00bb Enjoy|website=netkas.org}}</ref>\n\nIt was thought{{by whom|date=August 2014}} that Windows 7's support of EFI would result in PC motherboards replacing BIOS with EFI. MSI announced the Efinity mainboard in early 2008. As of 2011, EFI-based computers have entered the market, however none can natively boot Mac OS X due to the lack of a [[HFS+]] driver in the EFI implementation.\n\n==== Boot-132 ====\n\nBoot-132 is a bootloader provided by Apple for loading the XNU kernel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/Boot-132|title=Boot-132|accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref> In mid-2008, a new modified BOOT-132 came on to the scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=113288|title=New modified Boot-132 allows you to boot retail DVDs|date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref> This method allows users to conduct the Leopard-based OSx86 installation using a stock, retail-purchased copy of {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} Leopard and eradicates the necessity of a hacked installation like JaS or Kalyway (mentioned previously).  The Boot-132 bootloader essentially preloads an environment on the system from which Leopard can boot and operate. The bootloader stores the necessary files (kext files) in a .img collection or simply a folder. The luxury of this new installation method includes the ability to boot and install from a retail Leopard DVD and update straight from Apple without breaking the DMCA. The only possible problem here is that it breaks the macOS EULA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/21564/Building_a_Hackintosh_Apple_Can_t_Sue_You_For|title=Building a Hackintosh Apple Can't Sue You For|accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref>\n\nThe bootloader behaves like the [[Linux]] kernel: one can use an mboot-compatible (a patched [[syslinux]] was used for the hack) bootloader that tells boot-dfe about the .img file (the [[ramdisk]] or [[initrd]], as it's known by Linux users), and boot-dfe will then use the kexts (or mkext) from it. This new boot-dfe has been tested with the retail Leopard DVD, and it can boot, install, run Leopard without having to build a modified DVD.\n\n==== Chameleon ====\nSince the early developer builds of Mac OS X v10.6, members of the OSx86 community had been booting the new operating system using yet another bootloader called PC EFI provided by Russian hacker Netkas or the bootloader of the Voodoo team's Chameleon. Chameleon is based on David Elliot's Boot-132. The bootloader supports ACPI, SMBIOS, graphics, ethernet, and some other injections. It allows to boot up macOS on non-Macintosh hardware. Chameleon supports a lot of AMD as well as Nvidia graphics cards. There are a lot of forks of it by different developers; the latest version upstream is 2.2 from 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chameleon: Bring Mac OS X Developers Together |url=http://chameleon.osx86.hu/ |website=chameleon.osx86.hu |accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Clover====\nClover is a GUI bootloader for multiple operating systems that supports either UEFI or the legacy BIOS mode. To support booting EFI code, one of the two methods are conventionally taken: either Elliot's FakeEFI was used, or an actual open-source EFI system based on Intel's [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface#Intel EFI|TianoCore]] called DUET (Developer's UEFI Emulation) was flashed into the motherboard.<ref>{{cite web |title=A BIOS to UEFI Transformation |url=http://www.rodsbooks.com/bios2uefi/ |website=www.rodsbooks.com}}</ref> However, modern, non-Apple EFI firmware as well as Duet cannot directly load macOS due to various incompatibilities, mainly around the HFS+ file system but also due to the quirks of individual vendors. One more step was needed to load macOS systems: an EFI application to rectify these problems and bridge the gap.\n\nBeginning in March 2011, Slice discussed his idea with other community members, resulting in the development of a bootloader that can do both: emulate an EFI firmware of one's choice or use a Real UEFI firmware to boot Mac OS X.

The Live DVD allows booting to a working system with Mac OS X v10.4.8.\n\nOn January 2, 2009, InsanelyMac's Live DVD team published a new method by which a Mac OS X v10.5.x Live DVD could be produced, allowing users to boot a fully working macOS desktop from a DVD or USB flash drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=144128&st=0h |title=2009 Live DVD, how to make a simple, working osx livedvd |website=Insanelymac.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref>  The method was more reliable than previous methods because it manipulated Apple's existing Netboot and Imageboot functionalities and behaved as if the system were running off a network disk. It was easier to produce; requiring only a single script to be added to an existing installation. Distributions of the live DVD have been made since its inception.

Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of [[bison]].\n\nKansas was first settled by [[Americans]] in 1827 with the establishment of [[Fort Leavenworth]]. The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political wars over the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] debate. When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], abolitionist [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] from [[New England]] and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring [[Missouri]] rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a [[Slave states and free states|free state or a slave state]]. Thus, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided, and was known as [[Bleeding Kansas]].

The first European to set foot in present-day Kansas was the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado]], who explored the area in 1541. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was [[United States territorial acquisitions|acquired by the United States]] as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Southwest Kansas, however, was still a part of Spain, Mexico, and the [[Republic of Texas]] until the conclusion of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1848, when these lands were [[Mexican Cession|ceded to the United States]]. From 1812 to 1821, Kansas was part of the [[Missouri Territory]]. The [[Santa Fe Trail]] traversed Kansas from 1821 to 1880, transporting manufactured goods from [[Missouri]] and silver and furs from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. Wagon ruts from the trail are still visible in the prairie today.\n\nIn 1827, [[Fort Leavenworth]] became the first permanent settlement of white Americans in the future state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a211662.pdf|title=A Brief History of Fort Leavenworth|author=Partin, John W. Partin|year=1983|access-date=January 24, 2019}}</ref> The [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] became law on May 30, 1854, establishing [[Nebraska Territory]] and [[Kansas Territory]], and opening the area to broader settlement by whites. [[Kansas Territory]] stretched all the way to the Continental Divide and included the sites of present-day [[Denver]], [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]].\n[[File:Battle of Lawrence.png|thumb|[[Lawrence Massacre|Quantrill's Raid]] on [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]]]]\n\nMissouri and [[Arkansas]] sent settlers into Kansas all along its eastern border. These settlers attempted to sway votes in favor of slavery. The secondary settlement of Americans in Kansas Territory were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] from [[Massachusetts]] and other [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]], who attempted to stop the spread of slavery from neighboring Missouri. Directly presaging the [[American Civil War]], these forces collided, entering into skirmishes that earned the territory the name of [[Bleeding Kansas]].\n\nKansas was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as a free state on January 29, 1861, making it the 34th state to join the United States. By that time, the violence in Kansas had largely subsided, but during the Civil War, on August 21, 1863, [[William Quantrill]] led several hundred men on a raid into [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], destroying much of the city and killing nearly 200 people. He was roundly condemned by both the conventional [[Confederate States Army|Confederate military]] and the partisan rangers commissioned by the [[Missouri legislature]]. His application to that body for a commission was flatly rejected due to his pre-war criminal record.<ref>Jones, ''Gray Ghosts and Rebel Riders'' Holt & Co. 1956, p. 76</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, many veterans constructed homesteads in Kansas. Many [[African Americans]] also looked to Kansas as the land of \"[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]\" and, led by [[freedmen]] like [[Benjamin \"Pap\" Singleton]], began establishing black colonies in the state. Leaving southern states in the late 1870s because of increasing discrimination, they became known as [[Exodusters]].\n\nAt the same time, the [[Chisholm Trail]] was opened and the [[American Old West|Wild West]]-era commenced in Kansas. [[Wild Bill Hickok]] was a deputy marshal at [[Fort Riley]] and a marshal at [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]] and [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]]. [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] was another wild cowboy town, and both [[Bat Masterson]] and [[Wyatt Earp]] worked as lawmen in the town. In one year alone, eight million head of cattle from Texas boarded trains in Dodge City bound for the East, earning Dodge the nickname \"Queen of the Cowtowns\".\n\nIn response to demands of Methodists and other evangelical Protestants, in 1881 Kansas became the first U.S. state to adopt a constitutional amendment [[Prohibition|prohibiting]] all [[Alcohol laws of Kansas|alcoholic beverages]], which was repealed in 1948.\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:Great Plains LCC (14285769265).jpg|thumb|The [[Great Plains]] of Kansas]]\n[[File:Kanopolissp.JPG|thumb|[[Kanopolis State Park]]]]\n[[File:Wabaunsee County View.JPG|thumb|[[Flint Hills]] in Wabaunsee County]]\n\nKansas is bordered by [[Nebraska]] on the north; [[Missouri]] on the east; [[Oklahoma]] on the south; and [[Colorado]] on the west.

A sequence of [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]], [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Permian]] rocks outcrop in the eastern and southern part of the state. The state's western half has exposures of [[Cretaceous]] through Tertiary sediments, the latter derived from the [[erosion]] of the [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]] [[Rocky Mountains]] to the west. These are underlain by older Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments which correlate well with the outcrops to the east. The state's northeastern corner was subjected to [[glaciation]] in the [[Pleistocene]] and is covered by [[glacial drift]] and [[loess]].\n\n===Topography===\n\nThe western two-thirds of the state, lying in the [[Great Plains|great central plain]] of the United States, has a generally flat or undulating surface, while the eastern third has many hills and forests.

The eastern two-thirds of the state (especially the northeastern portion) has a [[humid continental climate]], with cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the precipitation falls during both the summer and the spring.\n\nThe western third of the state\u2014from roughly the [[U.S. Route 83]] corridor westward\u2014has a [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] [[steppe]] climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters are highly changeable between warm and very cold. The western region receives an average of about {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}} of precipitation per year. [[Chinook wind]]s in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=off}} range.\n\nThe far south-central and southeastern portions of the state, including the [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] area, have a [[humid subtropical climate]] with hot and humid summers, milder winters, and more precipitation than elsewhere in Kansas. Some features of all three climates can be found in most of the state, with droughts and changeable weather between dry and humid not uncommon, and both warm and cold spells in the winter.\n\nTemperatures in areas between U.S. Routes 83 and [[U.S. Route 81|81]], as well as the southwestern portion of the state along and south of [[U.S. Route 50|U.S. 50]], reach {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=}} or above on most days of June, July, and August. High humidity added to the high temperatures sends the [[heat index]] into life-threatening territory, especially in Wichita, [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], [[Russell, Kansas|Russell]], [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]], and [[Great Bend, Kansas|Great Bend]]. Temperatures are often higher in [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]], [[Garden City, Kansas|Garden City]], and [[Liberal, Kansas|Liberal]], but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature.\n\nAlthough temperatures of {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} or higher are not as common in areas east of U.S. 81, higher humidity and the [[urban heat island]] effect lead most summer days to heat indices between {{convert|107|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and {{convert|114|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], and the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]]. During the summer, nightly low temperatures in the northeastern part of the state, especially in the aforementioned large cities, struggle to fall below {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Also, combined with humidity between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat indices can be experienced at every hour of the day.\n\nPrecipitation ranges from about {{convert|47|in|mm}} annually in the state's southeast corner to about {{convert|16|in|mm}} in the southwest. Snowfall ranges from around {{convert|5|in|mm}} in the fringes of the south, to {{convert|35|in|mm}} in the far northwest. Frost-free days range from more than 200 days in the south, to 130 days in the northwest. Thus, Kansas is the country's ninth or tenth sunniest state, depending on the source. Western Kansas is as sunny as parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].\n\nKansas is prone to severe weather, especially in the spring and the early-summer. Despite the frequent sunshine throughout much of the state, due to its location at a climatic boundary prone to intrusions of multiple air masses, the state is vulnerable to strong and severe thunderstorms. Some of these storms become [[supercell]] thunderstorms; these can produce some [[tornado]]es, occasionally those of [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF3]] strength or higher. Kansas averages more than 50 tornadoes annually.<ref name=\"Annual Average Number of Tornadoes\">{{cite web |title = Annual Average Number of Tornadoes, 1953\u20132004 |url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] |accessdate = October 25, 2006 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archivedate = October 16, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Severe thunderstorms sometimes drop some very large [[hail]] over Kansas as well. Furthermore, these storms can even bring in flash flooding and damaging straight line winds.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the all-time highest temperature recorded in Kansas is ({{convert|121|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}) on July 24, 1936, near [[Alton, Kansas|Alton]] in [[Osborne County, Kansas|Osborne County]], and the all-time low is {{convert|-40|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} on February 13, 1905, near [[Lebanon, Kansas|Lebanon]] in [[Smith County, Kansas|Smith County]]. Alton and Lebanon are approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} apart.\n\nKansas's record high of {{convert|121|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|sigfig=3}} ties with [[North Dakota]] for the fifth-highest record high in an American state, behind California ({{convert|134|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), [[Arizona]] ({{convert|128|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), [[Nevada]] ({{convert|125|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), and [[New Mexico]] ({{convert|122|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or}}).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Various Kansas Cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n!

Production has experienced a steady, natural decline as it becomes increasingly difficult to extract oil over time. Since [[Price of oil|oil prices]] bottomed in 1999, oil production in Kansas has remained fairly constant, with an average monthly rate of about {{convert|2.8|Moilbbl|m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} in 2004. The [[Oil price increases since 2003|recent higher prices]] have made [[carbon dioxide]] sequestration and other oil recovery techniques more economical.\n\nKansas is also ranked eighth in US natural gas production. Production has steadily declined since the mid-1990s with the gradual depletion of the [[Hugoton Natural Gas Area|Hugoton Natural Gas Field]]\u2014the state's largest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas. In 2004, slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased [[coalbed methane]] production contributed to a smaller overall decline. Average monthly production was over {{convert|32|e9cuft|km3|abbr=off|sp=us}}.\n\nThe state's economy is also heavily influenced by the aerospace industry. Several large aircraft corporations have manufacturing facilities in Wichita and Kansas City, including [[Spirit AeroSystems]], [[Bombardier Aerospace]] ([[LearJet]]), and [[Textron Aviation]] (a merger of the former [[Cessna]], [[Hawker Aircraft|Hawker]], and [[Beechcraft]] brands). [[Boeing]] ended a decades-long history of manufacturing in Kansas between 2012 and 2013.\n\nMajor companies headquartered in Kansas include the [[Sprint Corporation]] (with world headquarters in [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]]), [[YRC Worldwide]] (Overland Park), [[Garmin]] ([[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]]), [[Payless Shoes]] (national headquarters and major distribution facilities in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]]), and [[Koch Industries]] (with national headquarters in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]), and [[Coleman Company|Coleman]] (headquarters in Wichita) . Telephone company [[Embarq]] formerly had its national headquarters in [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]] before its acquisition by [[CenturyTel]] in 2009, and still employs several hundred people in [[Gardner, Kansas|Gardner]].\n\nKansas is also home to three major military installations: [[Fort Leavenworth]] (Army), [[Fort Riley]] (Army), and [[McConnell Air Force Base]] (Air Force). Approximately 25,000 active duty soldiers and airmen are stationed at these bases which also employ approximately 8,000 civilian DoD employees. The US Army Reserve also has the 451st Expeditionary Sustainment Command headquartered in Wichita that serves reservists and their units from around the region. The Kansas Air National Guard has units at [[Forbes Field]] in Topeka and the 184th Intelligence Wing in Wichita. The Smoky Hill Weapons Range, a detachment of the Intelligence Wing, is one of the largest and busiest bombing ranges in the nation. During WWII, Kansas was home to numerous Army Air Corps training fields for training new pilots and aircrew. Many of those airfields live on today as municipal airports.\n\n===Taxes===\n\nTax is collected by the [[Kansas Department of Revenue]].\n\nRevenue shortfalls resulting from lower than expected tax collections and slower growth in personal income following a 1998 permanent tax reduction have contributed to the substantial growth in the state's debt level as bonded debt increased from $1.16&nbsp;billion in 1998 to $3.83&nbsp;billion in 2006. Some increase in debt was expected as the state continues with its 10-year Comprehensive Transportation Program enacted in 1999.\n\nIn 2003, Kansas had three income brackets for income tax calculation, ranging from 3.5% to 6.45%.\n\nThe state sales tax in Kansas is 6.15%. Various cities and counties in Kansas have an additional local sales tax. Except during the 2001 [[recession]] (March\u2013November 2001), when monthly sales tax collections were flat, collections have trended higher as the economy has grown and two rate increases have been enacted. If there had been no change in sales tax rates or in the economy, the total sales tax collections for 2003 would have been $1,797&nbsp;million, compared to $805.3&nbsp;million in 1990. However, they instead amounted to $1,630&nbsp;million an inflation-adjusted reduction of 10%. The state sales tax is a combined destination-based tax, meaning a single tax is applied that includes state, county, and local taxes, and the rate is based on where the consumer takes possession of the goods or services. Thanks to the destination structure and the numerous local special taxing districts, Kansas has 920 separate sales tax rates ranging from 6.5% to 11.5%.<ref>{{cite web |title = Publication 1700 |url = https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |website = Kansas Department of Revenue |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405025326/https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |archivedate = April 5, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> This taxing scheme, known as \"[[Streamlined Sales Tax]]\" was adopted on October 1, 2005, under the governorship of [[Kathleen Sebelius]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Streamlined Sales Tax\u2014Kansas |url = http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |website = Streamlined Sales Tax |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405090353/http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |archivedate = April 5, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Groceries are subject to sales tax in the state. All sales tax collected is remitted to the state department of revenue, and local taxes are then distributed to the various taxing agencies.\n\nAs of June 2004, [[Moody's Investors Service]] ranked the state 14th for net tax-supported debt per capita.

The Jayhawks have won five national titles, including NCAA tournament championships in 1952, 1988, and 2008. They also were retroactively awarded national championships by the [[Helms Foundation]] for 1922 and 1923. K-State also had a long stretch of success on the hardwood, lasting from the 1940s to the 1980s, making four [[Final Four]]s during that stretch. In 1988, KU and K-State met in the [[Elite Eight]], KU taking the game 71\u201358. After a 12-year absence, the Wildcats returned to the NCAA tournament in 2008, and advanced to the Elite Eight in 2010 and 2018. KU is fifth all-time with 15 Final Four appearances, while K-State's four appearances are tied for 17th.\n\nConversely, success on the [[American football|gridiron]] has been less frequent for both KSU and KU. However, there have been recent breakthroughs for both schools' football teams. The Jayhawks won the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] for the first time in three tries in 2008, capping a 12\u20131 season, the best in school history. And when [[Bill Snyder]] arrived to coach at K-State in 1989, he turned the Wildcats from one of the worst college football programs in America,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Looney |first=Douglas |title=Futility U |journal=Sports Illustrated |date=September 4, 1989 |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/09/04/120464/futility-u-kansas-state-winless-since-1986-has-one-claim-to-fame-it-is-americas-most-hapless-team}}</ref> into a national force for most of the 1990s and early 2000s. The team won the [[Fiesta Bowl]] in 1997, achieved an undefeated (11\u20130) regular season and No.{{nbsp}}1 ranking in 1998, and took the [[Big 12 Conference]] championship in 2003. After three seasons in which K-State football languished, Snyder came out of retirement in 2009 and guided them to the top of the college football ranks again, finishing second in the Big 12 in 2011 and earning a berth in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]], and winning the Big 12 again in 2012.\n\n[[Wichita State University]], which also fields teams (called the [[Wichita State Shockers|Shockers]]) in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], is best known for its baseball and basketball programs. In baseball, the Shockers won the [[College World Series]] in 1989. In men's basketball, they appeared in the Final Four in 1965 and 2013, and entered the 2014 NCAA tournament unbeaten. The school also fielded a [[American football|football]] team from 1897 to 1986. The Shocker football team is tragically known for a [[Wichita State University football team plane crash|plane crash]] in 1970 that killed 31 people, including 14 players.\n\n=====NCAA Division II schools=====\n\nNotable success has also been achieved by the state's smaller schools in football. [[Pittsburg State University]], an NCAA Division II participant, has claimed four national titles in football, two in the NAIA and most recently the 2011 NCAA Division II national title. Pittsburg State became the winningest NCAA Division II football program in 1995. PSU passed Hillsdale College at the top of the all-time victories list in the 1995 season on its march to the national runner-up finish. The Gorillas, in 96 seasons of intercollegiate competition, have accumulated 579 victories, posting a 579\u2013301\u201348 overall mark.\n\n[[Washburn University]], in Topeka, won the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] Men's Basketball Championship in 1987. The [[Fort Hays State University]] men won the 1996 NCAA Division II title with a 34\u20130 record, and the Washburn women won the 2005 NCAA Division II crown. St. Benedict's College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, won the 1954 and 1967 Men's NAIA Basketball Championships.\n\nThe [[Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference]] has its roots as one of the oldest college sport conferences in existence and participates in the NAIA and all ten member schools are in the state of Kansas. Other smaller school conferences that have some members in Kansas are the [[Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association]] the [[Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference]], the [[Midwest Christian College Conference]], and the [[Heart of America Athletic Conference]]. Many [[junior college]]s also have active athletic programs.\n\n[[Emporia State]]'s women's basketball team, under head coach [[Brandon Schneider]], who is now serving as the women's basketball coach at the University of Kansas, has seen success as well. In 2010 the team won the NCAA Division II National Championship. Emporia State and Washburn in Topeka share a heated rivalry in all sports, mostly due to the close proximity of both cities.\n\n=====Junior Colleges=====\n\nThe [[Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference]] has been heralded as one of the best conferences in all of [[NJCAA]] football, with [[Garden City Community College]], [[Independence Community College]], and [[Butler County Community College]] all consistently in contention for national championships.\n\n====High school====\n\nThe [[Kansas State High School Activities Association]] (KSHSAA) is the organization which oversees interscholastic competition in the state of Kansas at the high school level. It oversees both athletic and non-athletic competition, and sponsors championships in several sports and activities. The association is perhaps best known for devising the overtime system now used for almost all football games below the professional level (which has also been adopted at all levels of [[Canadian football]]).\n\n==Notable people==\n\n{{Main|List of people from Kansas}}\n\n==Landmarks==\n\n{{Main|List of Kansas landmarks}}\n{{See also|National Register of Historic Places listings in Kansas}}\n\n==See also==\n\n{{portal|Kansas|United States}}\n* [[Index of Kansas-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Kansas]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n<!--Note: the section name \"Bibliography\" is linked from other articles, posted in April 2018 by User:Sbmeirow-->\n{{See also|History of Kansas#Bibliography|l1=Longer list of books about the history of Kansas}}\n* {{Cite book |last1=Mechem |first1=Kirke |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1911 to 1925 |date=1956 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |isbn= |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/212250/ }}; 559 pages.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Mechem |first1=Kirke |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1886 to 1910 |date=1954 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |isbn= |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/212249/ }}; 535 pages.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Wilder |first1=Daniel W. |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1541 to 1885 |date=1886 |publisher=Kansas Publishing House |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/223666}}; 1204 pages.\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Connelley |editor-first=William E. |title=A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans |publisher=Lewis Publishing Company |year=1918 |url=http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1918ks/toc.html }}; 5 volumes; 2731 pages; ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo00conn/ Vol1]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo02conn/ Vol2]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo03conn/ Vol3]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo04conn/ Vol4]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo05conn/ Vol5]); the 1919 edition contains additional biographies.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Connelley |first1=William E. |title=History of Kansas Newspapers: A History of the Newspapers and Magazines Published in Kansas from 1854 to 1916 |date=1916 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/211020/ }}; 369 pages.\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Blackmar |editor-first=Frank W. |title=Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, Etc |publisher = Standard Publishing Co |year=1912 |url=http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1912/ }}; 3 volumes; 2723 pages; ([https://archive.org/details/kansascyc01blac/ Vol1]), ([https://archive.org/details/kansascycloped02blac/ Vol2]), ([https://archive.org/details/kansascyclopedia03blac/ Vol3])\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Everts |editor-first=Louis H. |title=Official State Atlas of Kansas |publisher=L.H.

Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of [[bison]].\n\nKansas was first settled by [[Americans]] in 1827 with the establishment of [[Fort Leavenworth]]. The pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political wars over the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] debate. When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], abolitionist [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] from [[New England]] and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring [[Missouri]] rushed to the territory to determine whether Kansas would become a [[Slave states and free states|free state or a slave state]]. Thus, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided, and was known as [[Bleeding Kansas]].

The first European to set foot in present-day Kansas was the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado]], who explored the area in 1541. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was [[United States territorial acquisitions|acquired by the United States]] as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Southwest Kansas, however, was still a part of Spain, Mexico, and the [[Republic of Texas]] until the conclusion of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1848, when these lands were [[Mexican Cession|ceded to the United States]]. From 1812 to 1821, Kansas was part of the [[Missouri Territory]]. The [[Santa Fe Trail]] traversed Kansas from 1821 to 1880, transporting manufactured goods from [[Missouri]] and silver and furs from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. Wagon ruts from the trail are still visible in the prairie today.\n\nIn 1827, [[Fort Leavenworth]] became the first permanent settlement of white Americans in the future state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a211662.pdf|title=A Brief History of Fort Leavenworth|author=Partin, John W. Partin|year=1983|access-date=January 24, 2019}}</ref> The [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] became law on May 30, 1854, establishing [[Nebraska Territory]] and [[Kansas Territory]], and opening the area to broader settlement by whites. [[Kansas Territory]] stretched all the way to the Continental Divide and included the sites of present-day [[Denver]], [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]].\n[[File:Battle of Lawrence.png|thumb|[[Lawrence Massacre|Quantrill's Raid]] on [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]]]]\n\nMissouri and [[Arkansas]] sent settlers into Kansas all along its eastern border. These settlers attempted to sway votes in favor of slavery. The secondary settlement of Americans in Kansas Territory were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] from [[Massachusetts]] and other [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]], who attempted to stop the spread of slavery from neighboring Missouri. Directly presaging the [[American Civil War]], these forces collided, entering into skirmishes that earned the territory the name of [[Bleeding Kansas]].\n\nKansas was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as a free state on January 29, 1861, making it the 34th state to join the United States. By that time, the violence in Kansas had largely subsided, but during the Civil War, on August 21, 1863, [[William Quantrill]] led several hundred men on a raid into [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], destroying much of the city and killing nearly 200 people. He was roundly condemned by both the conventional [[Confederate States Army|Confederate military]] and the partisan rangers commissioned by the [[Missouri legislature]]. His application to that body for a commission was flatly rejected due to his pre-war criminal record.<ref>Jones, ''Gray Ghosts and Rebel Riders'' Holt & Co. 1956, p. 76</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, many veterans constructed homesteads in Kansas. Many [[African Americans]] also looked to Kansas as the land of \"[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]\" and, led by [[freedmen]] like [[Benjamin \"Pap\" Singleton]], began establishing black colonies in the state. Leaving southern states in the late 1870s because of increasing discrimination, they became known as [[Exodusters]].\n\nAt the same time, the [[Chisholm Trail]] was opened and the [[American Old West|Wild West]]-era commenced in Kansas. [[Wild Bill Hickok]] was a deputy marshal at [[Fort Riley]] and a marshal at [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]] and [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]]. [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] was another wild cowboy town, and both [[Bat Masterson]] and [[Wyatt Earp]] worked as lawmen in the town. In one year alone, eight million head of cattle from Texas boarded trains in Dodge City bound for the East, earning Dodge the nickname \"Queen of the Cowtowns\".\n\nIn response to demands of Methodists and other evangelical Protestants, in 1881 Kansas became the first U.S. state to adopt a constitutional amendment [[Prohibition|prohibiting]] all [[Alcohol laws of Kansas|alcoholic beverages]], which was repealed in 1948.\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:Great Plains LCC (14285769265).jpg|thumb|The [[Great Plains]] of Kansas]]\n[[File:Kanopolissp.JPG|thumb|[[Kanopolis State Park]]]]\n[[File:Wabaunsee County View.JPG|thumb|[[Flint Hills]] in Wabaunsee County]]\n\nKansas is bordered by [[Nebraska]] on the north; [[Missouri]] on the east; [[Oklahoma]] on the south; and [[Colorado]] on the west. The state is divided into [[List of counties in Kansas|105 counties]] with [[List of cities in Kansas|628 cities]] with its largest county by area being [[Butler County, Kansas|Butler County]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/rank/kansas-state--land-area--county-rank.htm|title=Kansas Land Area County Rank|website=www.usa.com}}</ref> Kansas is located [[equidistant]] from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The [[Geographic center of the contiguous United States|geographic center of the 48 contiguous states]] is in [[Smith County, Kansas|Smith County]] near [[Lebanon, Kansas|Lebanon]]. Until 1989, the [[Meades Ranch Triangulation Station]] in [[Osborne County, Kansas|Osborne County]] was the geodetic center of North America: the central reference point for all maps of North America. The geographic center of Kansas is in [[Barton County, Kansas|Barton County]].\n\n===Geology===\n\n{{Main|Geology of Kansas}}\n\nKansas is underlain by a sequence of horizontal to gently westward [[Strike and dip|dipping]] [[sedimentary rock]]s. A sequence of [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]], [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Permian]] rocks outcrop in the eastern and southern part of the state. The state's western half has exposures of [[Cretaceous]] through Tertiary sediments, the latter derived from the [[erosion]] of the [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]] [[Rocky Mountains]] to the west. These are underlain by older Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments which correlate well with the outcrops to the east. The state's northeastern corner was subjected to [[glaciation]] in the [[Pleistocene]] and is covered by [[glacial drift]] and [[loess]].\n\n===Topography===\n\nThe western two-thirds of the state, lying in the [[Great Plains|great central plain]] of the United States, has a generally flat or undulating surface, while the eastern third has many hills and forests. The land gradually rises from east to west; its altitude ranges from {{convert|684|ft|m|sp=us|abbr=on}} along the [[Verdigris River]] at [[Coffeyville, Kansas|Coffeyville]] in [[Montgomery County, Kansas|Montgomery County]], to {{convert|4039|ft|m|sp=us|abbr=on}} at [[Mount Sunflower]], {{convert|0.5|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} from the Colorado border, in [[Wallace County, Kansas|Wallace County]].

The eastern two-thirds of the state (especially the northeastern portion) has a [[humid continental climate]], with cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the precipitation falls during both the summer and the spring.\n\nThe western third of the state\u2014from roughly the [[U.S. Route 83]] corridor westward\u2014has a [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] [[steppe]] climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters are highly changeable between warm and very cold. The western region receives an average of about {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}} of precipitation per year. [[Chinook wind]]s in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=off}} range.\n\nThe far south-central and southeastern portions of the state, including the [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] area, have a [[humid subtropical climate]] with hot and humid summers, milder winters, and more precipitation than elsewhere in Kansas. Some features of all three climates can be found in most of the state, with droughts and changeable weather between dry and humid not uncommon, and both warm and cold spells in the winter.\n\nTemperatures in areas between U.S. Routes 83 and [[U.S. Route 81|81]], as well as the southwestern portion of the state along and south of [[U.S. Route 50|U.S. 50]], reach {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=}} or above on most days of June, July, and August. High humidity added to the high temperatures sends the [[heat index]] into life-threatening territory, especially in Wichita, [[Hutchinson, Kansas|Hutchinson]], [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], [[Russell, Kansas|Russell]], [[Hays, Kansas|Hays]], and [[Great Bend, Kansas|Great Bend]]. Temperatures are often higher in [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]], [[Garden City, Kansas|Garden City]], and [[Liberal, Kansas|Liberal]], but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature.\n\nAlthough temperatures of {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} or higher are not as common in areas east of U.S. 81, higher humidity and the [[urban heat island]] effect lead most summer days to heat indices between {{convert|107|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and {{convert|114|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], and the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]]. During the summer, nightly low temperatures in the northeastern part of the state, especially in the aforementioned large cities, struggle to fall below {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Also, combined with humidity between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat indices can be experienced at every hour of the day.\n\nPrecipitation ranges from about {{convert|47|in|mm}} annually in the state's southeast corner to about {{convert|16|in|mm}} in the southwest. Snowfall ranges from around {{convert|5|in|mm}} in the fringes of the south, to {{convert|35|in|mm}} in the far northwest. Frost-free days range from more than 200 days in the south, to 130 days in the northwest. Thus, Kansas is the country's ninth or tenth sunniest state, depending on the source. Western Kansas is as sunny as parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].\n\nKansas is prone to severe weather, especially in the spring and the early-summer. Despite the frequent sunshine throughout much of the state, due to its location at a climatic boundary prone to intrusions of multiple air masses, the state is vulnerable to strong and severe thunderstorms. Some of these storms become [[supercell]] thunderstorms; these can produce some [[tornado]]es, occasionally those of [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF3]] strength or higher. Kansas averages more than 50 tornadoes annually.<ref name=\"Annual Average Number of Tornadoes\">{{cite web |title = Annual Average Number of Tornadoes, 1953\u20132004 |url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |publisher = [[National Climatic Data Center]] |accessdate = October 25, 2006 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archivedate = October 16, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Severe thunderstorms sometimes drop some very large [[hail]] over Kansas as well. Furthermore, these storms can even bring in flash flooding and damaging straight line winds.\n\nAccording to NOAA, the all-time highest temperature recorded in Kansas is ({{convert|121|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}) on July 24, 1936, near [[Alton, Kansas|Alton]] in [[Osborne County, Kansas|Osborne County]], and the all-time low is {{convert|-40|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} on February 13, 1905, near [[Lebanon, Kansas|Lebanon]] in [[Smith County, Kansas|Smith County]]. Alton and Lebanon are approximately {{convert|50|mi|km}} apart.\n\nKansas's record high of {{convert|121|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|sigfig=3}} ties with [[North Dakota]] for the fifth-highest record high in an American state, behind California ({{convert|134|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), [[Arizona]] ({{convert|128|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), [[Nevada]] ({{convert|125|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or|sigfig=3}}), and [[New Mexico]] ({{convert|122|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|disp=or}}).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Various Kansas Cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n!

Production has experienced a steady, natural decline as it becomes increasingly difficult to extract oil over time. Since [[Price of oil|oil prices]] bottomed in 1999, oil production in Kansas has remained fairly constant, with an average monthly rate of about {{convert|2.8|Moilbbl|m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} in 2004. The [[Oil price increases since 2003|recent higher prices]] have made [[carbon dioxide]] sequestration and other oil recovery techniques more economical.\n\nKansas is also ranked eighth in US natural gas production. Production has steadily declined since the mid-1990s with the gradual depletion of the [[Hugoton Natural Gas Area|Hugoton Natural Gas Field]]\u2014the state's largest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas. In 2004, slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased [[coalbed methane]] production contributed to a smaller overall decline. Average monthly production was over {{convert|32|e9cuft|km3|abbr=off|sp=us}}.\n\nThe state's economy is also heavily influenced by the aerospace industry. Several large aircraft corporations have manufacturing facilities in Wichita and Kansas City, including [[Spirit AeroSystems]], [[Bombardier Aerospace]] ([[LearJet]]), and [[Textron Aviation]] (a merger of the former [[Cessna]], [[Hawker Aircraft|Hawker]], and [[Beechcraft]] brands). [[Boeing]] ended a decades-long history of manufacturing in Kansas between 2012 and 2013.\n\nMajor companies headquartered in Kansas include the [[Sprint Corporation]] (with world headquarters in [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]]), [[YRC Worldwide]] (Overland Park), [[Garmin]] ([[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]]), [[Payless Shoes]] (national headquarters and major distribution facilities in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]]), and [[Koch Industries]] (with national headquarters in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]), and [[Coleman Company|Coleman]] (headquarters in Wichita) . Telephone company [[Embarq]] formerly had its national headquarters in [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]] before its acquisition by [[CenturyTel]] in 2009, and still employs several hundred people in [[Gardner, Kansas|Gardner]].\n\nKansas is also home to three major military installations: [[Fort Leavenworth]] (Army), [[Fort Riley]] (Army), and [[McConnell Air Force Base]] (Air Force). Approximately 25,000 active duty soldiers and airmen are stationed at these bases which also employ approximately 8,000 civilian DoD employees. The US Army Reserve also has the 451st Expeditionary Sustainment Command headquartered in Wichita that serves reservists and their units from around the region. The Kansas Air National Guard has units at [[Forbes Field]] in Topeka and the 184th Intelligence Wing in Wichita. The Smoky Hill Weapons Range, a detachment of the Intelligence Wing, is one of the largest and busiest bombing ranges in the nation. During WWII, Kansas was home to numerous Army Air Corps training fields for training new pilots and aircrew. Many of those airfields live on today as municipal airports.\n\n===Taxes===\n\nTax is collected by the [[Kansas Department of Revenue]].\n\nRevenue shortfalls resulting from lower than expected tax collections and slower growth in personal income following a 1998 permanent tax reduction have contributed to the substantial growth in the state's debt level as bonded debt increased from $1.16&nbsp;billion in 1998 to $3.83&nbsp;billion in 2006. Some increase in debt was expected as the state continues with its 10-year Comprehensive Transportation Program enacted in 1999.\n\nIn 2003, Kansas had three income brackets for income tax calculation, ranging from 3.5% to 6.45%.\n\nThe state sales tax in Kansas is 6.15%. Various cities and counties in Kansas have an additional local sales tax. Except during the 2001 [[recession]] (March\u2013November 2001), when monthly sales tax collections were flat, collections have trended higher as the economy has grown and two rate increases have been enacted. If there had been no change in sales tax rates or in the economy, the total sales tax collections for 2003 would have been $1,797&nbsp;million, compared to $805.3&nbsp;million in 1990. However, they instead amounted to $1,630&nbsp;million an inflation-adjusted reduction of 10%. The state sales tax is a combined destination-based tax, meaning a single tax is applied that includes state, county, and local taxes, and the rate is based on where the consumer takes possession of the goods or services. Thanks to the destination structure and the numerous local special taxing districts, Kansas has 920 separate sales tax rates ranging from 6.5% to 11.5%.<ref>{{cite web |title = Publication 1700 |url = https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |website = Kansas Department of Revenue |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405025326/https://www.ksrevenue.org/salesratechanges.html |archivedate = April 5, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> This taxing scheme, known as \"[[Streamlined Sales Tax]]\" was adopted on October 1, 2005, under the governorship of [[Kathleen Sebelius]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Streamlined Sales Tax\u2014Kansas |url = http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |website = Streamlined Sales Tax |accessdate = April 4, 2018 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180405090353/http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=kansas |archivedate = April 5, 2018 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Groceries are subject to sales tax in the state. All sales tax collected is remitted to the state department of revenue, and local taxes are then distributed to the various taxing agencies.\n\nAs of June 2004, [[Moody's Investors Service]] ranked the state 14th for net tax-supported debt per capita. As a percentage of personal income, it was at 3.8%\u2014above the median value of 2.5% for all rated states and having risen from a value of less than 1% in 1992. The state has a statutory requirement to maintain cash reserves of at least 7.5% of expenses at the end of each fiscal year; however, lawmakers can vote to override the rule, and did so during the most recent budget agreement.\n\n{{Main|Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117}}\n\nDuring his campaign for the 2010 election, Governor [[Sam Brownback]] called for a complete \"phase out of Kansas's income tax\".<ref name=\"theatlantic_tax_experiment_dead_2017\"/> In May 2012, Governor Brownback signed into law the '''Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117'''.<ref name=\"HB2117\">{{cite web |title = Senate Substitute for HB 2117 by Committee on Taxation\u2014Reduction of income tax rates for individuals and determination of income tax credits; severance tax exemptions; homestead property tax refunds; food sales tax refunds |url = http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/hb2117/ |accessdate = October 29, 2014 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141030002120/http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2012/b2011_12/measures/hb2117/ |archivedate = October 30, 2014 |df = mdy-all}}</ref> Starting in 2013, the \"ambitious tax overhaul\" trimmed income tax, eliminated some corporate taxes, and created [[Flow-through entity|pass-through income]] tax exemptions, he raised the sales tax by one percent to offset the loss to state revenues but that was inadequate.

However, Topeka was unable to support the team, and it disbanded after one year.\n\nThe first night game in the history of professional baseball was played in Independence on April 28, 1930 when the Muscogee (Oklahoma) Indians beat the Independence Producers 13\u20133 in a minor league game sanctioned by the Western League of the Western Baseball Association with 1,500 fans attending the game. The permanent lighting system was first used for an exhibition game on April 17, 1930 between the Independence Producers and House of David semi-professional baseball team of Benton Harbor, Michigan with the Independence team winning 9\u20131 before a crowd of 1,700 spectators.<ref>Bowman, Larry G. \"I Think It Is Pretty Ritzy Myself: Kansas Minor League Teams and Night Baseball\".

The teams are rivals in the [[Big 12 Conference]].\n\nBoth KU and K-State have tradition-rich programs in men's basketball. The Jayhawks are a perennial national power, ranking second in all-time victories among NCAA programs, behind [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]]. The Jayhawks have won five national titles, including NCAA tournament championships in 1952, 1988, and 2008. They also were retroactively awarded national championships by the [[Helms Foundation]] for 1922 and 1923. K-State also had a long stretch of success on the hardwood, lasting from the 1940s to the 1980s, making four [[Final Four]]s during that stretch. In 1988, KU and K-State met in the [[Elite Eight]], KU taking the game 71\u201358. After a 12-year absence, the Wildcats returned to the NCAA tournament in 2008, and advanced to the Elite Eight in 2010 and 2018. KU is fifth all-time with 15 Final Four appearances, while K-State's four appearances are tied for 17th.\n\nConversely, success on the [[American football|gridiron]] has been less frequent for both KSU and KU. However, there have been recent breakthroughs for both schools' football teams. The Jayhawks won the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] for the first time in three tries in 2008, capping a 12\u20131 season, the best in school history. And when [[Bill Snyder]] arrived to coach at K-State in 1989, he turned the Wildcats from one of the worst college football programs in America,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Looney |first=Douglas |title=Futility U |journal=Sports Illustrated |date=September 4, 1989 |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1989/09/04/120464/futility-u-kansas-state-winless-since-1986-has-one-claim-to-fame-it-is-americas-most-hapless-team}}</ref> into a national force for most of the 1990s and early 2000s. The team won the [[Fiesta Bowl]] in 1997, achieved an undefeated (11\u20130) regular season and No.{{nbsp}}1 ranking in 1998, and took the [[Big 12 Conference]] championship in 2003. After three seasons in which K-State football languished, Snyder came out of retirement in 2009 and guided them to the top of the college football ranks again, finishing second in the Big 12 in 2011 and earning a berth in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]], and winning the Big 12 again in 2012.\n\n[[Wichita State University]], which also fields teams (called the [[Wichita State Shockers|Shockers]]) in [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], is best known for its baseball and basketball programs. In baseball, the Shockers won the [[College World Series]] in 1989. In men's basketball, they appeared in the Final Four in 1965 and 2013, and entered the 2014 NCAA tournament unbeaten. The school also fielded a [[American football|football]] team from 1897 to 1986. The Shocker football team is tragically known for a [[Wichita State University football team plane crash|plane crash]] in 1970 that killed 31 people, including 14 players.\n\n=====NCAA Division II schools=====\n\nNotable success has also been achieved by the state's smaller schools in football. [[Pittsburg State University]], an NCAA Division II participant, has claimed four national titles in football, two in the NAIA and most recently the 2011 NCAA Division II national title. Pittsburg State became the winningest NCAA Division II football program in 1995. PSU passed Hillsdale College at the top of the all-time victories list in the 1995 season on its march to the national runner-up finish. The Gorillas, in 96 seasons of intercollegiate competition, have accumulated 579 victories, posting a 579\u2013301\u201348 overall mark.\n\n[[Washburn University]], in Topeka, won the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] Men's Basketball Championship in 1987. The [[Fort Hays State University]] men won the 1996 NCAA Division II title with a 34\u20130 record, and the Washburn women won the 2005 NCAA Division II crown. St. Benedict's College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, won the 1954 and 1967 Men's NAIA Basketball Championships.\n\nThe [[Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference]] has its roots as one of the oldest college sport conferences in existence and participates in the NAIA and all ten member schools are in the state of Kansas. Other smaller school conferences that have some members in Kansas are the [[Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association]] the [[Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference]], the [[Midwest Christian College Conference]], and the [[Heart of America Athletic Conference]]. Many [[junior college]]s also have active athletic programs.\n\n[[Emporia State]]'s women's basketball team, under head coach [[Brandon Schneider]], who is now serving as the women's basketball coach at the University of Kansas, has seen success as well. In 2010 the team won the NCAA Division II National Championship. Emporia State and Washburn in Topeka share a heated rivalry in all sports, mostly due to the close proximity of both cities.\n\n=====Junior Colleges=====\n\nThe [[Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference]] has been heralded as one of the best conferences in all of [[NJCAA]] football, with [[Garden City Community College]], [[Independence Community College]], and [[Butler County Community College]] all consistently in contention for national championships.\n\n====High school====\n\nThe [[Kansas State High School Activities Association]] (KSHSAA) is the organization which oversees interscholastic competition in the state of Kansas at the high school level. It oversees both athletic and non-athletic competition, and sponsors championships in several sports and activities. The association is perhaps best known for devising the overtime system now used for almost all football games below the professional level (which has also been adopted at all levels of [[Canadian football]]).\n\n==Notable people==\n\n{{Main|List of people from Kansas}}\n\n==Landmarks==\n\n{{Main|List of Kansas landmarks}}\n{{See also|National Register of Historic Places listings in Kansas}}\n\n==See also==\n\n{{portal|Kansas|United States}}\n* [[Index of Kansas-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Kansas]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n<!--Note: the section name \"Bibliography\" is linked from other articles, posted in April 2018 by User:Sbmeirow-->\n{{See also|History of Kansas#Bibliography|l1=Longer list of books about the history of Kansas}}\n* {{Cite book |last1=Mechem |first1=Kirke |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1911 to 1925 |date=1956 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |isbn= |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/212250/ }}; 559 pages.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Mechem |first1=Kirke |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1886 to 1910 |date=1954 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |isbn= |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/212249/ }}; 535 pages.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Wilder |first1=Daniel W. |title=The Annals of Kansas: 1541 to 1885 |date=1886 |publisher=Kansas Publishing House |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/223666}}; 1204 pages.\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Connelley |editor-first=William E. |title=A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans |publisher=Lewis Publishing Company |year=1918 |url=http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1918ks/toc.html }}; 5 volumes; 2731 pages; ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo00conn/ Vol1]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo02conn/ Vol2]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo03conn/ Vol3]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo04conn/ Vol4]), ([https://archive.org/details/standardhistoryo05conn/ Vol5]); the 1919 edition contains additional biographies.\n* {{Cite book |last1=Connelley |first1=William E. |title=History of Kansas Newspapers: A History of the Newspapers and Magazines Published in Kansas from 1854 to 1916 |date=1916 |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |url=https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/211020/ }}; 369 pages.\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Blackmar |editor-first=Frank W. |title=Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, Etc |publisher = Standard Publishing Co |year=1912 |url=http://www.ksgenweb.org/archives/1912/ }}; 3 volumes; 2723 pages; ([https://archive.org/details/kansascyc01blac/ Vol1]), ([https://archive.org/details/kansascycloped02blac/ Vol2]), ([https://archive.org/details/kansascyclopedia03blac/ Vol3])\n* {{Citation |editor-last=Everts |editor-first=Louis H. |title=Official State Atlas of Kansas |publisher=L.H.

The remaining {{convert|44|acre|m2}} were opened for a residential development which he named Ben Avon Heights.

The borough was incorporated in 1913.\n\nWhen the Ben Avon Country Club closed in 1917, it was divided into lots for additional housing.  The Shannopin Country Club, the only commercial property in Ben Avon Heights, opened in 1920 with its clubhouse in Ben Avon Heights and golf course in neighboring [[Kilbuck Township, Pennsylvania|Kilbuck Township]].  In the early 1930s, John I. Thompson purchased a portion of the original John Wilson Farm in Kilbuck Township and transformed the farmland into another residential area known as the Thompson Plan.  The borough annexed the Thompson Plan in 1936, setting the boundaries of Ben Avon Heights to the way they are today.\n\nThe borough now contains 148 homes, a community park, and the club house of the Shannopin Country Club.<ref name = \"official site\">{{cite web | title = The History of The Borough of Ben Avon Heights | work = Official Ben Avon Heights Web Site | url =http://www.benavonheightsborough.com/ | accessdate = 2007-07-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929034403/http://www.benavonheightsborough.com/| archivedate=September 29, 2007| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==Government and politics==\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential Elections Results'''<ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2012 Allegheny County election|url=http://triblive.com/politics/2907065-74/pittsburgh-ward-hills-west-borough-braddock-east-elizabeth-north-park|website=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2016 Pennsylvani general election...|url=http://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/electionresultsgen2016/|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!
