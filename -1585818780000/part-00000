The fluid is contained within a flexible tube fitted inside a circular pump casing (though linear peristaltic pumps have been made). A [[Rotor (turbine)|rotor]] with a number of \"rollers\", \"shoes\", \"wipers\", or \"lobes\" attached to the external circumference of the rotor compresses the flexible tube. As the rotor turns, the part of the tube under compression is pinched closed (or \"occludes\") thus forcing the fluid to be pumped to move through the tube. Additionally, as the tube opens to its natural state after the passing of the cam (\"restitution\" or \"resilience\") fluid flow is induced to the pump. This process is called [[peristalsis]] and is used in many biological systems such as the [[gastrointestinal tract]].  Typically, there will be two or more rollers, or wipers, occluding the tube, trapping between them a body of fluid.  The body of fluid is then transported, at ambient pressure, toward the pump outlet.  Peristaltic pumps may run continuously, or they may be indexed through partial revolutions to deliver smaller amounts of fluid.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Schlauchpumpe-lineare-Verdraengung.png|thumb|Linear peristaltic pump]]\nThe peristaltic pump was first patented in the United States by Rufus Porter and J.D.

The first technically and commercially viable peristaltic pump for use outside the laboratory was developed by Bernard Refson, an inventor who went on to establish Watson-Marlow Fluid Technology Group, a peristaltic pump manufacturer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com/AboutUs/Documents/Knowledge,%20Service,%20Products.pdf|title='The Watson-Marlow story' Knowledge, Service, Products: The history of Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc. pg.99|last=Watson|first=Nigel|date=5 July 2019|website=http://www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nPeristaltic pumps are typically used to pump clean/sterile or aggressive fluids without exposing those fluids to contamination from exposed pump components. Some common applications include pumping IV fluids through an infusion device, [[apheresis]], aggressive chemicals, high solids slurries and other materials where isolation of the product from the environment, and the environment from the product, are critical.  It is also used in [[heart-lung machine]]s to circulate blood during a [[bypass surgery]], and in [[hemodialysis]] systems, as the pump does not cause significant [[hemolysis]].\n\nPeristaltic pumps are also used in a wide variety of industrial applications, especially agriculture as they are well suited for common agricultural chemicals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sprayersupplies.com/sprayer-pump-guide|title=Sprayer Pump Types, Costs, and Specifications|date=2018-10-13|work=Sprayer Supplies|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-US}}</ref> Their unique design makes roller pumps especially suited to pumping abrasives<ref name=\"ts\" >{{cite web \n  |title=Cole-Parmer Process Peristaltic Pumps Provide Superior Abrasive Handling Lowering Maintenance Costs |url=https://www.coleparmer.com/tech-article/superior-peristaltic-handling-low-maintenance-costs\n}}</ref> and viscous fluids.<ref name=\"viscous\">[https://fscimage.thermoscientific.com/images/D01174~.pdf Handling Viscous Fluids] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405102004/https://fscimage.thermoscientific.com/images/D01174~.pdf |date=2012-04-05 }}</ref>\n\n==Key design parameters==\n\nThe ideal peristaltic pump should have an infinite diameter of the pump head and the largest possible diameter of the rollers. Such an ideal peristaltic pump would offer the longest possible tubing lifetime and provide a constant and pulsation-free flow rate.\n\nSuch an ideal peristaltic pump can not be constructed in reality. However, peristaltic pumps can be designed to approach these ideal peristaltic pump parameters. One example of a possible construction is depicted. The exceptional design of the few peristaltic pumps offer constant accurate flow rates for several weeks together with a long tubing lifetime without the risk of tubing rupture.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Chemical compatibility===\nThe pumped fluid contacts only the inside surface of the tubing thereby negating concern for other valves, O-rings or seals that might be incompatible with fluid being pumped. Therefore, only the composition of the tubing that the pumped medium travels through is considered for chemical compatibility.\n\nThe tubing needs to be [[elastomer]]ic to maintain the circular cross section after millions of cycles of squeezing in the pump. This requirement eliminates a variety of non-elastomeric polymers that have compatibility with a wide range of chemicals, such as [[PTFE]], [[polyolefins]], [[PVDF]], etc. from consideration as material for pump tubing. The popular elastomers for pump tubing are [[nitrile]] (NBR), [[Hypalon]], [[Viton]], [[silicone]], [[PVC]], [[EPDM]], EPDM+[[polypropylene]] (as in [[Santoprene]]), [[polyurethane]] and natural [[rubber]]. Of these materials, natural rubber has the best fatigue resistance, and EPDM and Hypalon have the best chemical compatibility. Silicone is popular with water-based fluids, such as in [[bio-pharma]] industry, but have limited range of chemical compatibility in other industries.\n\nExtruded [[fluoropolymer]] tubes such as [[FKM]] (Viton, Fluorel, etc.) have good compatibility with acids, [[hydrocarbon]]s, and [[petroleum fuel]]s, but have insufficient fatigue resistance to achieve an effective tube life.\n\nThere are a couple of newer tubing developments that offer a broad chemical compatibility using lined tubing and [[fluoroelastomer]]s.\n\nWith lined tubing, the thin inside liner is made of a chemically resistant material such as poly-olefin and PTFE that form a barrier for the rest of the tubing wall from coming in contact with the pumped fluid. These liners are materials that are often not elastomeric, therefore the entire tube wall cannot be made with this material for peristaltic pump applications. This tubing provides adequate chemical compatibility and life to be used in chemically challenging applications. There are a few things to keep in mind when using these tubes - any pin holes in the liner during manufacturing could render the tubing vulnerable to chemical attack. In the case of stiff plastic liners like the polyolefins, with repeated flexing in the peristaltic pump they can develop cracks, rendering the bulk material again vulnerable to chemical attack. A common issue with all lined tubing is delamination of the liner with repeated flexing that signals the end of the tube's life. For those with need for chemically compatible tubing, these lined tubing offer a good solution.\n\nWith fluoroelastomer tubing, the elastomer itself has the chemical resistance. In the case of e.g. Chem-Sure, it is made of a perfluoroelastomer, that has the broadest chemical compatibility of all elastomers. The two fluoroelastomer tubes listed above combine the chemical compatibility with a very long tube life stemming from their reinforcement technology, but come at a pretty high initial cost. One has to justify the cost with the total value derived over the long tube life, and compare with other options such as other tubing or even other pump technologies.\n\nThere are many online sites for checking the chemical compatibility of the tubing material with the pumped fluid. The tubing manufacturers may also have compatibility charts specific to their tubing production method, coating, material and the fluid being pumped.\n\nWhile these charts cover a list of commonly encountered fluids, they may not have all the fluids. If there is a fluid whose compatibility is not listed anywhere, then a common test of compatibility is the immersion testing. A 1 to 2&nbsp;inch sample of the tubing is immersed in the fluid to be pumped for anywhere from 24 to 48 hours, and the amount of weight change from before and after the immersion is measured. If the weight change is greater than 10% of the initial weight, then that tube is not compatible with the fluid, and should not be used in that application. This test is still a one way test, in the sense that there is still a remote chance that the tubing that passes this test can still be incompatible for the application since the combination of borderline compatibility and mechanical flexing can push the tube over the edge, resulting in premature tube failure.\n\nIn general, recent tubing developments have brought broad chemical compatibility to the peristaltic pump option that many chemical dosing applications can benefit over other current pump technologies.\n\n===Occlusion===\nThe minimum gap between the roller and the housing determines the maximum squeeze applied on the tubing.  The amount of squeeze applied to the tubing affects pumping performance and the tube life - more squeezing decreases the tubing life dramatically, while less squeezing can cause the pumped medium to slip back, especially in high pressure pumping, and decreases the efficiency of the pump dramatically and the high velocity of the slip back typically causes premature failure of the hose.  Therefore, this amount of squeeze becomes an important design parameter.\n\nThe term \"occlusion\" is used to measure the amount of squeeze.  It is either expressed as a percentage of twice the wall thickness, or as an absolute amount of the wall that is squeezed.\n\nLet\n:  y = occlusion\n:  g = minimum gap between the roller and the housing\n:  t = wall thickness of the tubing\n\nThen\n:  y = 2t - g                   (when expressed as the absolute amount of squeeze)\n:  y = (2t - g) / (2t) \u00d7 100 (when expressed as a percentage of twice the wall thickness)\n\nThe occlusion is typically 10 to 20%, with a higher occlusion for a softer tube material and a lower occlusion for a harder tube material.\n\nThus for a given pump, the most critical tubing dimension becomes the wall thickness.  An interesting point here is that the inside diameter of the tubing is not an important design parameter for the suitability of the tubing for the pump.  Therefore, it is common for more than one ID be used with a pump, as long as the wall thickness remains the same.\n\n===Inside diameter===\nFor a given rpm of the pump, a tube with larger inside diameter (ID) will give higher flow rate than one with a smaller inside diameter.  Intuitively the flow rate is a function of the cross section area of the tube bore.\n\n=== Flow rate ===\nFlow rate is an important parameter for a pump.  The flow rate in a peristaltic pump is determined by many factors, such as:\n# Tube ID - higher flow rate with larger ID\n# Pump head OD - higher flow rate with larger OD\n# Pump head RPM - higher flow rate with higher RPM\n# Inlet Pulsation - the pulse reduces the filling volume of the hose\n\nIncreasing the number of rollers doesn't increase the flow rate, instead it will decrease the flow rate somewhat by reducing the effective (i.e. fluid-pumping) circumference of the head.  Increasing rollers does tend to decrease the amplitude of the fluid pulsing at the outlet by increasing the frequency of the pulsed flow.\n\nThe length of tube (measured from initial pinch point near the inlet to the final release point near the outlet) does not affect the flow rate. However, a longer tube implies more pinch points between inlet and outlet, increasing the pressure that the pump can generate.\n\nThe flow rate of a peristaltic pump is in most cases not linear. The effect of pulsation at the inlet of the pump changes the filling degree of the peristaltic hose. With high inlet pulsation the peristaltic hose with become oval and this is resulting in less flow.\nAccurate metering with a peristaltic pump is therefore only possible when the pump has a constant flow rate, or when inlet pulsation is complete eliminated with the use of correct designed pulsation dampeners.\n\n===Pulsation===\nPulsation is an important side effect of the peristaltic pump.  The pulsation in a peristaltic pump is determined by many factors, such as:\n# Flow Rate - higher flow rate is more pulsation\n# Line Length - Long pipe lines is more pulsation\n# Higher Pump Speed - higher RPM is more pulsation\n# Specific gravity of the fluid - higher fluid density is more Pulsation\n\n==Variations==\n\n===Hose pumps===\nHigher pressure peristaltic [[Hose (tubing)|hose]] pumps which can typically operate against up to 16 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] in continuous service, use shoes (rollers only used on low pressure types) and have casings filled with [[lubricant]] to prevent abrasion of the exterior of the pump tube and to aid in the dissipation of heat, and use reinforced tubes, often called \"hoses\". This class of pump is often called a \"hose pump\".\n\nThe biggest advantage with the hose pumps over the roller pumps is the high operating pressure of up to 16 bar. With rollers max pressure can arrive up to 12 Bar without any problem. If the high operating pressure is not required, a tubing pump is a better option than a hose pump if the pumped medium is not abrasive.  With recent advances made in the tubing technology for pressure, life and chemical compatibility, as well as the higher flow rate ranges, the advantages that hose pumps had over roller pumps continues to erode.\n\n===Tube pumps===\nLower pressure peristaltic pumps typically have dry casings and use rollers along with non-reinforced, extruded tubing. This class of pump is sometimes called a \"tube pump\" or \"tubing pump\".  These pumps employ rollers to squeeze the tube.  Except for the 360\u00b0 eccentric pump design as described below, these pumps have a minimum of 2 rollers 180\u00b0 apart, and may have as many as 8, or even 12 rollers.  Increasing the number of rollers increase the pressure pulse frequency of the pumped fluid at the outlet, thereby decreasing the amplitude of pulsing.  The downside to increasing number of rollers it that it proportionately increases number of squeezes, or occlusions, on the tubing for a given cumulative flow through that tube, thereby reducing the tubing life.\n\nThere are two kinds of roller design in peristaltic pumps:\n* Fixed occlusion - In this kind of pump, the rollers have a fixed locus as it turns, keeping the occlusion constant as it squeezes the tube.  This is a simple, yet effective design.  The only downside to this design is that the occlusion as a percent on the tube varies with the variation of the tube wall thickness.  Typically the wall thickness of the extruded tubes vary enough that the % occlusion can vary with the wall thickness (see above).  Therefore, a section of tube with greater wall thickness, but within the accepted tolerance, will have higher percent occlusion, which increases the wear on the tubing, thereby decreasing the tube life.  Tube wall thickness tolerances today are generally kept tight enough that this issue is not of much practical concern.  For those mechanically inclined, this may be the constant strain operation.\n* Spring-loaded rollers - As the name indicates, the rollers in this pump are mounted on a spring.  This design is more elaborate than the fixed occlusion, but helps overcome the variations in the tube wall thickness over a broader range.  Regardless of the variations, the roller imparts the same amount of stress on the tubing that is proportional to the spring constant, making this a constant stress operation.  The spring is selected to overcome not only the hoop strength of the tubing, but also the pressure of the pumped fluid.\n\nThe operating pressure of these pumps is determined by the tubing and by the motor's ability to overcome the hoop strength of the tubing and the fluid pressure.\n\n===Microfluidic pumps===\n[[File:Peristaltic pump.png|thumb|The pumping sequence used in a pneumatically-actuated microfluidic peristaltic pump.<ref name=\"Wu\">{{cite journal\n | last = Wu\n | first = Min Hsien\n | last2 = Huang\n | first2 = Song Bin\n | last3 = Cui\n | first3 = Zhanfeng\n | last4 = Cui\n | first4 = Zheng\n | last5 = Lee\n | first5 = Gwo Bin\n | title = Development of perfusion-based micro 3-D cell culture platform and its application for high throughput drug testing\n | journal = Sensors and Actuators, B: Chemical\n | volume = 129\n | issue = 1\n | pages = 231\u2013240\n|date=2008\n | doi=10.1016/j.snb.2007.07.145\n}}</ref>]]\nIn microfluidics, it is often desirable to minimize the circulating volume of fluid.

The fluid is contained within a flexible tube fitted inside a circular pump casing (though linear peristaltic pumps have been made). A [[Rotor (turbine)|rotor]] with a number of \"rollers\", \"shoes\", \"wipers\", or \"lobes\" attached to the external circumference of the rotor compresses the flexible tube. As the rotor turns, the part of the tube under compression is pinched closed (or \"occludes\") thus forcing the fluid to be pumped to move through the tube. Additionally, as the tube opens to its natural state after the passing of the cam (\"restitution\" or \"resilience\") fluid flow is induced to the pump. This process is called [[peristalsis]] and is used in many biological systems such as the [[gastrointestinal tract]].  Typically, there will be two or more rollers, or wipers, occluding the tube, trapping between them a body of fluid.  The body of fluid is then transported, at ambient pressure, toward the pump outlet.  Peristaltic pumps may run continuously, or they may be indexed through partial revolutions to deliver smaller amounts of fluid.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Schlauchpumpe-lineare-Verdraengung.png|thumb|Linear peristaltic pump]]\nThe peristaltic pump was first patented in the United States by Rufus Porter and J.D.

The first technically and commercially viable peristaltic pump for use outside the laboratory was developed by Bernard Refson, an inventor who went on to establish Watson-Marlow Fluid Technology Group, a peristaltic pump manufacturer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com/AboutUs/Documents/Knowledge,%20Service,%20Products.pdf|title='The Watson-Marlow story' Knowledge, Service, Products: The history of Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc. pg.99|last=Watson|first=Nigel|date=5 July 2019|website=http://www.spiraxsarcoengineering.com/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nPeristaltic pumps are typically used to pump clean/sterile or aggressive fluids without exposing those fluids to contamination from exposed pump components. Some common applications include pumping IV fluids through an infusion device, [[apheresis]], aggressive chemicals, high solids slurries and other materials where isolation of the product from the environment, and the environment from the product, are critical.  It is also used in [[heart-lung machine]]s to circulate blood during a [[bypass surgery]], and in [[hemodialysis]] systems, as the pump does not cause significant [[hemolysis]].\n\nPeristaltic pumps are also used in a wide variety of industrial applications, especially agriculture as they are well suited for common agricultural chemicals.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sprayersupplies.com/sprayer-pump-guide|title=Sprayer Pump Types, Costs, and Specifications|date=2018-10-13|work=Sprayer Supplies|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-US}}</ref> Their unique design makes roller pumps especially suited to pumping abrasives<ref name=\"ts\" >{{cite web \n  |title=Cole-Parmer Process Peristaltic Pumps Provide Superior Abrasive Handling Lowering Maintenance Costs |url=https://www.coleparmer.com/tech-article/superior-peristaltic-handling-low-maintenance-costs\n}}</ref> and viscous fluids.<ref name=\"viscous\">[https://fscimage.thermoscientific.com/images/D01174~.pdf Handling Viscous Fluids] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405102004/https://fscimage.thermoscientific.com/images/D01174~.pdf |date=2012-04-05 }}</ref>\n\n==Key design parameters==\n\nThe ideal peristaltic pump should have an infinite diameter of the pump head and the largest possible diameter of the rollers. Such an ideal peristaltic pump would offer the longest possible tubing lifetime and provide a constant and pulsation-free flow rate.\n\nSuch an ideal peristaltic pump can not be constructed in reality. However, peristaltic pumps can be designed to approach these ideal peristaltic pump parameters. One example of a possible construction is depicted. The exceptional design of the few peristaltic pumps offer constant accurate flow rates for several weeks together with a long tubing lifetime without the risk of tubing rupture.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Chemical compatibility===\nThe pumped fluid contacts only the inside surface of the tubing thereby negating concern for other valves, O-rings or seals that might be incompatible with fluid being pumped. Therefore, only the composition of the tubing that the pumped medium travels through is considered for chemical compatibility.\n\nThe tubing needs to be [[elastomer]]ic to maintain the circular cross section after millions of cycles of squeezing in the pump. This requirement eliminates a variety of non-elastomeric polymers that have compatibility with a wide range of chemicals, such as [[PTFE]], [[polyolefins]], [[PVDF]], etc. from consideration as material for pump tubing. The popular elastomers for pump tubing are [[nitrile]] (NBR), [[Hypalon]], [[Viton]], [[silicone]], [[PVC]], [[EPDM]], EPDM+[[polypropylene]] (as in [[Santoprene]]), [[polyurethane]] and natural [[rubber]]. Of these materials, natural rubber has the best fatigue resistance, and EPDM and Hypalon have the best chemical compatibility. Silicone is popular with water-based fluids, such as in [[bio-pharma]] industry, but have limited range of chemical compatibility in other industries.\n\nExtruded [[fluoropolymer]] tubes such as [[FKM]] (Viton, Fluorel, etc.) have good compatibility with acids, [[hydrocarbon]]s, and [[petroleum fuel]]s, but have insufficient fatigue resistance to achieve an effective tube life.\n\nThere are a couple of newer tubing developments that offer a broad chemical compatibility using lined tubing and [[fluoroelastomer]]s.\n\nWith lined tubing, the thin inside liner is made of a chemically resistant material such as poly-olefin and PTFE that form a barrier for the rest of the tubing wall from coming in contact with the pumped fluid. These liners are materials that are often not elastomeric, therefore the entire tube wall cannot be made with this material for peristaltic pump applications. This tubing provides adequate chemical compatibility and life to be used in chemically challenging applications. There are a few things to keep in mind when using these tubes - any pin holes in the liner during manufacturing could render the tubing vulnerable to chemical attack. In the case of stiff plastic liners like the polyolefins, with repeated flexing in the peristaltic pump they can develop cracks, rendering the bulk material again vulnerable to chemical attack. A common issue with all lined tubing is delamination of the liner with repeated flexing that signals the end of the tube's life. For those with need for chemically compatible tubing, these lined tubing offer a good solution.\n\nWith fluoroelastomer tubing, the elastomer itself has the chemical resistance. In the case of e.g. Chem-Sure, it is made of a perfluoroelastomer, that has the broadest chemical compatibility of all elastomers. The two fluoroelastomer tubes listed above combine the chemical compatibility with a very long tube life stemming from their reinforcement technology, but come at a pretty high initial cost. One has to justify the cost with the total value derived over the long tube life, and compare with other options such as other tubing or even other pump technologies.\n\nThere are many online sites for checking the chemical compatibility of the tubing material with the pumped fluid. The tubing manufacturers may also have compatibility charts specific to their tubing production method, coating, material and the fluid being pumped.\n\nWhile these charts cover a list of commonly encountered fluids, they may not have all the fluids. If there is a fluid whose compatibility is not listed anywhere, then a common test of compatibility is the immersion testing. A 1 to 2&nbsp;inch sample of the tubing is immersed in the fluid to be pumped for anywhere from 24 to 48 hours, and the amount of weight change from before and after the immersion is measured. If the weight change is greater than 10% of the initial weight, then that tube is not compatible with the fluid, and should not be used in that application. This test is still a one way test, in the sense that there is still a remote chance that the tubing that passes this test can still be incompatible for the application since the combination of borderline compatibility and mechanical flexing can push the tube over the edge, resulting in premature tube failure.\n\nIn general, recent tubing developments have brought broad chemical compatibility to the peristaltic pump option that many chemical dosing applications can benefit over other current pump technologies.\n\n===Occlusion===\nThe minimum gap between the roller and the housing determines the maximum squeeze applied on the tubing.  The amount of squeeze applied to the tubing affects pumping performance and the tube life - more squeezing decreases the tubing life dramatically, while less squeezing can cause the pumped medium to slip back, especially in high pressure pumping, and decreases the efficiency of the pump dramatically and the high velocity of the slip back typically causes premature failure of the hose.  Therefore, this amount of squeeze becomes an important design parameter.\n\nThe term \"occlusion\" is used to measure the amount of squeeze.  It is either expressed as a percentage of twice the wall thickness, or as an absolute amount of the wall that is squeezed.\n\nLet\n:  y = occlusion\n:  g = minimum gap between the roller and the housing\n:  t = wall thickness of the tubing\n\nThen\n:  y = 2t - g                   (when expressed as the absolute amount of squeeze)\n:  y = (2t - g) / (2t) \u00d7 100 (when expressed as a percentage of twice the wall thickness)\n\nThe occlusion is typically 10 to 20%, with a higher occlusion for a softer tube material and a lower occlusion for a harder tube material.\n\nThus for a given pump, the most critical tubing dimension becomes the wall thickness.  An interesting point here is that the inside diameter of the tubing is not an important design parameter for the suitability of the tubing for the pump.  Therefore, it is common for more than one ID be used with a pump, as long as the wall thickness remains the same.\n\n===Inside diameter===\nFor a given rpm of the pump, a tube with larger inside diameter (ID) will give higher flow rate than one with a smaller inside diameter.  Intuitively the flow rate is a function of the cross section area of the tube bore.\n\n=== Flow rate ===\nFlow rate is an important parameter for a pump.  The flow rate in a peristaltic pump is determined by many factors, such as:\n# Tube ID - higher flow rate with larger ID\n# Pump head OD - higher flow rate with larger OD\n# Pump head RPM - higher flow rate with higher RPM\n# Inlet Pulsation - the pulse reduces the filling volume of the hose\n\nIncreasing the number of rollers doesn't increase the flow rate, instead it will decrease the flow rate somewhat by reducing the effective (i.e. fluid-pumping) circumference of the head.  Increasing rollers does tend to decrease the amplitude of the fluid pulsing at the outlet by increasing the frequency of the pulsed flow.\n\nThe length of tube (measured from initial pinch point near the inlet to the final release point near the outlet) does not affect the flow rate. However, a longer tube implies more pinch points between inlet and outlet, increasing the pressure that the pump can generate.\n\nThe flow rate of a peristaltic pump is in most cases not linear. The effect of pulsation at the inlet of the pump changes the filling degree of the peristaltic hose. With high inlet pulsation the peristaltic hose with become oval and this is resulting in less flow.\nAccurate metering with a peristaltic pump is therefore only possible when the pump has a constant flow rate, or when inlet pulsation is complete eliminated with the use of correct designed pulsation dampeners.\n\n===Pulsation===\nPulsation is an important side effect of the peristaltic pump.  The pulsation in a peristaltic pump is determined by many factors, such as:\n# Flow Rate - higher flow rate is more pulsation\n# Line Length - Long pipe lines is more pulsation\n# Higher Pump Speed - higher RPM is more pulsation\n# Specific gravity of the fluid - higher fluid density is more Pulsation\n\n==Variations==\n\n===Hose pumps===\nHigher pressure peristaltic [[Hose (tubing)|hose]] pumps which can typically operate against up to 16 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] in continuous service, use shoes (rollers only used on low pressure types) and have casings filled with [[lubricant]] to prevent abrasion of the exterior of the pump tube and to aid in the dissipation of heat, and use reinforced tubes, often called \"hoses\". This class of pump is often called a \"hose pump\".\n\nThe biggest advantage with the hose pumps over the roller pumps is the high operating pressure of up to 16 bar. With rollers max pressure can arrive up to 12 Bar without any problem. If the high operating pressure is not required, a tubing pump is a better option than a hose pump if the pumped medium is not abrasive.  With recent advances made in the tubing technology for pressure, life and chemical compatibility, as well as the higher flow rate ranges, the advantages that hose pumps had over roller pumps continues to erode.\n\n===Tube pumps===\nLower pressure peristaltic pumps typically have dry casings and use rollers along with non-reinforced, extruded tubing. This class of pump is sometimes called a \"tube pump\" or \"tubing pump\".  These pumps employ rollers to squeeze the tube.  Except for the 360\u00b0 eccentric pump design as described below, these pumps have a minimum of 2 rollers 180\u00b0 apart, and may have as many as 8, or even 12 rollers.  Increasing the number of rollers increase the pressure pulse frequency of the pumped fluid at the outlet, thereby decreasing the amplitude of pulsing.  The downside to increasing number of rollers it that it proportionately increases number of squeezes, or occlusions, on the tubing for a given cumulative flow through that tube, thereby reducing the tubing life.\n\nThere are two kinds of roller design in peristaltic pumps:\n* Fixed occlusion - In this kind of pump, the rollers have a fixed locus as it turns, keeping the occlusion constant as it squeezes the tube.  This is a simple, yet effective design.  The only downside to this design is that the occlusion as a percent on the tube varies with the variation of the tube wall thickness.  Typically the wall thickness of the extruded tubes vary enough that the % occlusion can vary with the wall thickness (see above).  Therefore, a section of tube with greater wall thickness, but within the accepted tolerance, will have higher percent occlusion, which increases the wear on the tubing, thereby decreasing the tube life.

The original Western Australian Basketball Association was formed by a small group of basketball enthusiasts at the Perth YMCA on Murray Street on Wednesday, 3 April 1946. The sport had already been played across the state for 35 years, but there had been no official management or promotion of the sport. [[Johnny Leonard|John Leonard]], a highly respected Perth businessman, athlete and two-time winner of football's coveted [[Sandover Medal]], played a key role in orchestrating the first meeting on 3 April 1946. The initial aim was to form a body that would manage, control and promote the development of basketball in Western Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://basketballwa.asn.au/history-of-basketball-wa/|title=HISTORY OF BASKETBALL WA|work=basketballwa.asn.au|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref> As a result, the local associations played in a winter competition at [[Claremont Showground]] for the John Leonard Perpetual Shield.<ref name=handbook89>{{cite book |year=1989 |title=McDonald's State Basketball League Handbook 1989 |publisher=Western Australian Basketball Federation (Inc.) |page=7\u20139}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1962 Commonwealth Games]], the WABF's headquarters switched to the newly-built [[Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium]]. The A&nbsp;Grade competition continued until 1972, when it was renamed the District Competition, involving seven association teams, although this was soon increased to eight. This format continued to 1987, although the competition underwent several name changes as sponsors began to show their interest. 1987 was something of a watershed year for the WABF, as the entire structure of the game in [[Western Australia]] was being reconsidered.<ref name=\"handbook89\" />\n\nThe impetus for the rethink was the dire financial straits which the WABF found itself in the previous year. The [[Perth Wildcats]] had been a financial burden since joining the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) in 1982, and at the end of the 1986 season, the WABF was $400,000 in the red. A task force was established to sort out the mess, and the upshot was that Perth businessman Bob Williams, sponsor of the Wildcats in 1986, purchased a 60 percent interest in the team from the WABF for $200,000. The WABF's administration was also restructured, with Alan Marshall joining as chief executive with a brief to put the WABF on a firm financial footing.<ref name=\"handbook89\" />\n\nA census in 1987 showed that 61 percent of WABF members were from country areas, so it was decided to try to include several country teams in the state's premier basketball league. However, this could not be done until the WABF had traded out its difficulties. Fortunately, the Wildcats had a hugely successful season in 1987\u2014reaching the NBL Grand Final in their first trip to the finals\u2014attracting much television coverage, which saw basketball's popularity soar.<ref name=\"handbook89\" />\n\nAn immediate result of the sport's new popularity was the debut of [[McDonald's]] as a sponsor. The fast-food chain entered into a $150,000 three-year deal with the WABF, sponsoring the premier competition and funding an extensive junior programme.<ref name=\"handbook89\" />\n\nIn 1988, it was decided to form a '''State Basketball League''' for both men and women, and to develop it into an elite, statewide competition as soon as possible. This meant seeking out private owners and attracting corporate sponsorship, so as to not burden the association. As part of basketball's development, the [[Western Australian Institute of Sport]] men's team was included in the SBL under Warren Kuhn.<ref name=\"handbook89\" />\n\nSimon Leunig, who had been the WABF's development officer, was appointed general manager of the SBL, and set about organising an expanded league for 1989.
