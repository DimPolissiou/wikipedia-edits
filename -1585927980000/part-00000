As families have degenerated, the practice of being a stay-at-home dad has become more common and socially acceptable. Pre-[[industrialization]], the family worked together as a unit and was self-sufficient.<ref name=Goode/> When [[Love marriage|affection-based marriages]] emerged in the 1830s, [[parent]]s began devoting more attention to children and family relationships became more open.<ref name=Burgess/>\n\nThe number of stay-at-home dads began gradually increasing in the late 20th century, especially in developed Western nations. The recent statistic that [[Pew Research]] released, showed a report in June 2014 that found 2&nbsp;million men to be stay-at-home dads in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://athomedad.org/media-resources/statistics/|title=Statistics on Stay-At-Home Dads|website=National At-Home Dad Network|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-16}}</ref> However, in 2010, the number of stay-at-home dads had reached its highest point of 2.2&nbsp;million.\n\nThough the role is subject to many [[stereotype]]s, and men may have difficulties accessing parenting benefits, communities, and services targeted at mothers, it became more socially acceptable by the 2000s.<ref>[[Andrea Doucet]], 2006.

Not only had many women found a new sense of independence, but cultural shifts were underway, including the rise of feminism and the development of reliable methods of [[birth control]]. Such changes caused some women to decide to end their unhappy marriages.<ref name=\"Tuttle\">{{cite book|last=Tuttle|first=W.|title=Daddy's gone to war: The Second World War in the lives of America's children|isbn=0195049055|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1993|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195049053/page/144 144]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195049053/page/144}}</ref>\n\nThe 1950s saw a \"[[baby boom]]\" in America. This period was also called the \"Golden '50s\". This was credited to families trying to make up lost time after the war. As a result, many families moved to the [[suburbs]] instead of residing in the [[city]], the number of two-income families began to increase, and grown children began to remain at home longer because of [[financial]] difficulties.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coontz|first=S.|title=Marriage a history: How love conquered marriage|isbn=067003407X|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|year=2005|page=[https://archive.org/details/marriagehistoryf00coon/page/201 201]|url=https://archive.org/details/marriagehistoryf00coon/page/201}}</ref> Gradually, women began re-entering the workforce. This progression away from the traditional view of the woman as the homemaker led to the creation of the role of the stay-at-home dad.\n\n==Increase in popularity in the 21st century==\n\nStay-at-home dads have been seen in increasing numbers in [[Western world|Western]] culture, especially in Canada, the UK, and the United States since the late 20th century. In developed East Asian nations such as Japan and [[South Korea]], this practice is less common.<ref name=sparkaction.org/>\n\nThere are several reasons why some families feel that it would be more beneficial for the father to be the primary caregiver while the [[mother]] works outside the home. The decision to use a stay-at-home dad arrangement is most commonly due to economic reasons. At the same time, women are progressing into higher-paying jobs. There are now financial ramifications in deciding whether the mother or father should become the stay-at-home parent. In cases where the woman is the higher-paid parent, it makes more economic sense for her to continue to work while the man takes on the caregiver role.<ref name=Gill/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/fashion/24marriage.html|title=Working Women Say Their Marriage Is Richer For It|first=Tara|last=Parker-Pope|date=18 May 2018|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> It also makes sense at times the mother's job offers [[health]] benefits for the family whereas the father's does not.<ref name=Gill/> It has also been shown that if the \"pregnancy was jointly planned\", the father is more likely to be involved.<ref>Cowan, Carolyn Pape, et al. \"Encouraging strong relationships between fathers and children.\" ''Working Strategies'' 8.4 (2005): 2.</ref>\n\nWith the growth of [[telecommuting]], many men are also able to work from home.<ref name=Gill/> In this regard, he is contributing financially to the family while also acting as the primary caregiver of the family's children.<ref name=Gill/> Differences in parents' schedules can also account for some of the stay-at-home dads. Sometimes the father works odd work shifts while the mother has a typical nine-to-five work schedule.<ref name=Gill/>\n\nFixed [[gender]] roles began to become less prominent in the Western world starting in the late 20th century, allowing men to make their own choice of [[career]] without regard to traditional gender-based roles.<ref name=sparkaction.org/> Some men who choose this role may do so because they enjoy being an active part of their children's lives, while in other families, the mother wants to pursue her career.<ref name=Gill/> For example, of the 187 participants at ''Fortune'' magazine's Most Powerful Women in the Business Summit, one-third of the women's husbands were stay-at-home dads.<ref name=Benokraitis>Benokraitis, Nijole V. ''Marriages & Families: Changes, Choices and Constraints.'' New Jersey: Pearson Educations Inc., 2008</ref>\nFamilies vary widely in terms of how household chores are divided.<ref name=Gill/> Some [[retirement|retired]] males who [[marriage|marry]] a younger woman decide to become stay-at-home dads while their [[wife|wives]] work because they want a \"second chance\" to watch a child grow up in a second or third marriage.<ref name=Benokraitis/> Additionally, more career and lifestyle options are accepted and prevalent in Western [[society]].<ref name=Gill/> There are also fewer restrictions on what constitutes a [[family]].<ref name=Gill>{{cite book|last=Gill|first=Libby|title=Stay-At-Home Dads: The Essential Guide to Creating the New Family|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|year=2001}}</ref>\n\n==Disadvantages==\n\nDepending on the country or region, a stay-at-home dad might find more or less [[social]] support for his decision. In regions where [[traditional]] roles prevail, a stay-at-home dad might be shunned by stay-at-home moms' [[peer group]]s.<ref name=\"athome\"/> In order to find support for their choice, these men have created and joined many support [[Social network|networks]].<ref name=\"athome\">{{cite web|url=http://www.athomedad.org |title=The Stay At Home Dad Oasis - Resources, Information, Connections, and Community for involved dads |publisher=AtHomeDad.org |date= |accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref>\n\t\t\t\nStill, many men struggle to find acceptance within the role of stay-at-home dad despite the many gains that have been made. Many worry about losing business skills and their \"professional place in line\".<ref name=Benokraitis/> There is a common misconception that stay-at-home dads cannot get a job and therefore must rewrite the typical [[family]] roles, forcing the [[wife]] into the [[workforce]].<ref name=\"Gill\"/> In the United Kingdom, some househusbands say their wives lost respect for them, divorced them, then won custody of the children.<ref name=Appleyard/>\n\nOne 2002 study by the American Heart Association suggested stay-at-home dads may face a higher risk of [[heart disease]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Rhonda Rowland CNN Medical Unit |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/conditions/04/24/heart.role.reversal/ |title=Beyond tantrum control: Stay-at-home dads face health risks |publisher=CNN |date=2002-04-25 |accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref> The reasons for the health risk are not specified.\n\nThe role of stay-at-home dad may be difficult for men who feel as though they had no option. It is hard for these men to adapt from being a financial provider in the family to being a [[homemaker]].<ref name=Benokraitis/> Men who willingly choose to become a stay-at-home dad are much more satisfied with their role in the family.<ref name=Benokraitis/>\n\n==Advantages==\n\n===For the child===\n\nThere have been many studies done which suggest the importance of the [[paternal]] role in a child's life and benefits of the stay-at-home dad.<ref name=\"sparkaction.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sparkaction.org/node/54|title=Connect for Kids|accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> Children respond differently to males and females at birth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparkaction.org/node/54|title=Kyle Pruett Talks About Fatherhood {{!}} SparkAction|website=www.sparkaction.org|access-date=2016-03-22}}</ref>\n\nA study conducted by a United States child psychiatrist, [[Kyle Pruett|Kyle D. Pruett]], found that [[infants]] between 7 and 30 months responded more favourably to being picked up by their fathers.<ref name=Gill/> Pruett also found that a father's parenting style is beneficial for a child's physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioural development.<ref name=Pruett>Pruett, Kyle D. ''Fatherneed.'' Michigan: Free Press, 2000.</ref> Mothers reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to manage their frustration. This helps the children learn to deal with stress and frustration.<ref name=Pruett/> A long-term study Pruett conducted proved that a father's active involvement with his children, from birth to adolescence, promotes greater emotional balance, stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self-assurance in the child.<ref name=Pruett/>\n\nAdditional studies show that during the first five years of a child's life, the father's role is more influential than the mother's in how the child learns to manage his or her body, navigate social circumstances, and play.<ref name=sparkaction.org/> Furthermore, a 1996 study by [[McGill University]] found that the \"single most important childhood factor in developing [[empathy]] is paternal involvement in childcare\".<ref name=Gill/>  Children that have a strong paternal influence have more nurturing abilities.<ref>Frank, Robert A. \"The Role of the Primary Caregiving Father.\" (1995).</ref>  It has been researched in ''The Role of the Father in Child Development'', that in general, children with stay-at-home dads develop attachments at infancy.<ref>Lamb, Michael E., ed. ''The role of the father in child development''. John Wiley & Sons, 2004.</ref> The study further concluded that fathers who spent time alone bonding with their children more than twice per week brought up the most compassionate [[adults]].<ref name=Gill/>\n\nRobert Frank, a professor of [[child development]] at Oakton Community College in [[Illinois]], conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a [[stay-at-home mom]].<ref name=Frank>Frank, Robert. The Role of the Primary Caregiving Father. Loyola University of Chicago, 1995.</ref> His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home.<ref name=\"Tucker\"/> Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children on a day-to-day basis than their male counterparts.<ref name=\"Tucker\"/> His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong.<ref name=\"Tucker\"/> This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.<ref name=\"Tucker\">Tucker, Patrick. \"Stay At Home Dad's.\" The Futurist Sept. 2005: 12-13.</ref>\n\n===For the mother===\n\nThe stay-at-home dad arrangement allows the mother to work without having to use a [[daycare]] or a [[nanny]]. This arrangement prevents the mother from having to deal with the [[stress (biology)|stress]] of finding acceptable childcare, checking backgrounds, and paying for care.<ref name=Gill/> This arrangement also can help ensure that the family's values are being upheld and instilled in the children. Free from the stress of childcare, the working mother is able to actively pursue their career. This allows for a more relaxed working environment for the mother and allows her to focus on her career.  If the mother has a higher paying job, this extra income will allow for savings to be made for the children; these savings could help the mother later on pay for [[university]] for the child or children. Thus, she can advance her career and provide more money for the family.<ref name=Gill/> It puts a sound mind for the mother knowing that the child/children are at a safe place with the father having the same safety and values as the mother. These are the same advantages for the father from having a [[stay-at-home mom]] arrangement.\n\n===For the father===\n\nA survey conducted by [[Minnesota]]'s Department for Families and Children's Services shows that men consider child care to be far more important than a paycheck. Of 600 dads surveyed, a majority said their most important role was to \"show love and affection\" to kids. \"Safety and protection\" came next, followed by \"moral guidance\", \"taking time to play\", and \"teaching and encouraging\". \"Financial care\" finished last.  Many men are now becoming more involved in their children's lives, and because of that many men now have a better understanding of what life is like for their child growing up in modern society.  Because fathers are immersed in their children's lives, many of the stereotypically \"manly\" attitudes and activities historically prescribed for children may be circumscribed due to a more gender-neutral parenting approach that focuses on promoting independence and emotional well being. This allows children, especially male children, to grow up with a greater capacity for empathy and less rigidity in attitudes pertaining to gender roles than would perhaps be the case in more traditionally-structured households.<ref name= Braiker>Braiker, B., Kuchment, A., & Dy, C.

The decision to use a stay-at-home dad arrangement is most commonly due to economic reasons. At the same time, women are progressing into higher-paying jobs. There are now financial ramifications in deciding whether the mother or father should become the stay-at-home parent. In cases where the woman is the higher-paid parent, it makes more economic sense for her to continue to work while the man takes on the caregiver role.<ref name=Gill/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/fashion/24marriage.html|title=Working Women Say Their Marriage Is Richer For It|first=Tara|last=Parker-Pope|date=18 May 2018|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> It also makes sense at times the mother's job offers [[health]] benefits for the family whereas the father's does not.<ref name=Gill/> It has also been shown that if the \"pregnancy was jointly planned\", the father is more likely to be involved.<ref>Cowan, Carolyn Pape, et al. \"Encouraging strong relationships between fathers and children.\" ''Working Strategies'' 8.4 (2005): 2.</ref>\n\nWith the growth of [[telecommuting]], many men are also able to work from home.<ref name=Gill/> In this regard, he is contributing financially to the family while also acting as the primary caregiver of the family's children.<ref name=Gill/> Differences in parents' schedules can also account for some of the stay-at-home dads. Sometimes the father works odd work shifts while the mother has a typical nine-to-five work schedule.<ref name=Gill/>\n\nFixed [[gender]] roles began to become less prominent in the Western world starting in the late 20th century, allowing men to make their own choice of [[career]] without regard to traditional gender-based roles.<ref name=sparkaction.org/> Some men who choose this role may do so because they enjoy being an active part of their children's lives, while in other families, the mother wants to pursue her career.<ref name=Gill/> For example, of the 187 participants at ''Fortune'' magazine's Most Powerful Women in the Business Summit, one-third of the women's husbands were stay-at-home dads.<ref name=Benokraitis>Benokraitis, Nijole V. ''Marriages & Families: Changes, Choices and Constraints.'' New Jersey: Pearson Educations Inc., 2008</ref>\nFamilies vary widely in terms of how household chores are divided.<ref name=Gill/> Some [[retirement|retired]] males who [[marriage|marry]] a younger woman decide to become stay-at-home dads while their [[wife|wives]] work because they want a \"second chance\" to watch a child grow up in a second or third marriage.<ref name=Benokraitis/> Additionally, more career and lifestyle options are accepted and prevalent in Western [[society]].<ref name=Gill/> There are also fewer restrictions on what constitutes a [[family]].<ref name=Gill>{{cite book|last=Gill|first=Libby|title=Stay-At-Home Dads: The Essential Guide to Creating the New Family|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|year=2001}}</ref>\n\n==Disadvantages==\n\nDepending on the country or region, a stay-at-home dad might find more or less [[social]] support for his decision. In regions where [[traditional]] roles prevail, a stay-at-home dad might be shunned by stay-at-home moms' [[peer group]]s.<ref name=\"athome\"/> In order to find support for their choice, these men have created and joined many support [[Social network|networks]].<ref name=\"athome\">{{cite web|url=http://www.athomedad.org |title=The Stay At Home Dad Oasis - Resources, Information, Connections, and Community for involved dads |publisher=AtHomeDad.org |date= |accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref>\n\t\t\t\nStill, many men struggle to find acceptance within the role of stay-at-home dad despite the many gains that have been made. Many worry about losing business skills and their \"professional place in line\".<ref name=Benokraitis/> There is a common misconception that stay-at-home dads cannot get a job and therefore must rewrite the typical [[family]] roles, forcing the [[wife]] into the [[workforce]].<ref name=\"Gill\"/> In the United Kingdom, some househusbands say their wives lost respect for them, divorced them, then won custody of the children.<ref name=Appleyard/>\n\nOne 2002 study by the American Heart Association suggested stay-at-home dads may face a higher risk of [[heart disease]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Rhonda Rowland CNN Medical Unit |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/conditions/04/24/heart.role.reversal/ |title=Beyond tantrum control: Stay-at-home dads face health risks |publisher=CNN |date=2002-04-25 |accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref> The reasons for the health risk are not specified.\n\nThe role of stay-at-home dad may be difficult for men who feel as though they had no option.

Pruett]], found that [[infants]] between 7 and 30 months responded more favourably to being picked up by their fathers.<ref name=Gill/> Pruett also found that a father's parenting style is beneficial for a child's physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioural development.<ref name=Pruett>Pruett, Kyle D. ''Fatherneed.'' Michigan: Free Press, 2000.</ref> Mothers reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to manage their frustration. This helps the children learn to deal with stress and frustration.<ref name=Pruett/> A long-term study Pruett conducted proved that a father's active involvement with his children, from birth to adolescence, promotes greater emotional balance, stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self-assurance in the child.<ref name=Pruett/>\n\nAdditional studies show that during the first five years of a child's life, the father's role is more influential than the mother's in how the child learns to manage his or her body, navigate social circumstances, and play.<ref name=sparkaction.org/> Furthermore, a 1996 study by [[McGill University]] found that the \"single most important childhood factor in developing [[empathy]] is paternal involvement in childcare\".<ref name=Gill/>  Children that have a strong paternal influence have more nurturing abilities.<ref>Frank, Robert A. \"The Role of the Primary Caregiving Father.\" (1995).</ref>  It has been researched in ''The Role of the Father in Child Development'', that in general, children with stay-at-home dads develop attachments at infancy.<ref>Lamb, Michael E., ed. ''The role of the father in child development''. John Wiley & Sons, 2004.</ref> The study further concluded that fathers who spent time alone bonding with their children more than twice per week brought up the most compassionate [[adults]].<ref name=Gill/>\n\nRobert Frank, a professor of [[child development]] at Oakton Community College in [[Illinois]], conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a [[stay-at-home mom]].<ref name=Frank>Frank, Robert. The Role of the Primary Caregiving Father. Loyola University of Chicago, 1995.</ref> His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home.<ref name=\"Tucker\"/> Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children on a day-to-day basis than their male counterparts.<ref name=\"Tucker\"/> His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong.<ref name=\"Tucker\"/> This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.<ref name=\"Tucker\">Tucker, Patrick. \"Stay At Home Dad's.\" The Futurist Sept. 2005: 12-13.</ref>\n\n===For the mother===\n\nThe stay-at-home dad arrangement allows the mother to work without having to use a [[daycare]] or a [[nanny]]. This arrangement prevents the mother from having to deal with the [[stress (biology)|stress]] of finding acceptable childcare, checking backgrounds, and paying for care.<ref name=Gill/> This arrangement also can help ensure that the family's values are being upheld and instilled in the children. Free from the stress of childcare, the working mother is able to actively pursue their career. This allows for a more relaxed working environment for the mother and allows her to focus on her career.  If the mother has a higher paying job, this extra income will allow for savings to be made for the children; these savings could help the mother later on pay for [[university]] for the child or children. Thus, she can advance her career and provide more money for the family.<ref name=Gill/> It puts a sound mind for the mother knowing that the child/children are at a safe place with the father having the same safety and values as the mother. These are the same advantages for the father from having a [[stay-at-home mom]] arrangement.\n\n===For the father===\n\nA survey conducted by [[Minnesota]]'s Department for Families and Children's Services shows that men consider child care to be far more important than a paycheck. Of 600 dads surveyed, a majority said their most important role was to \"show love and affection\" to kids. \"Safety and protection\" came next, followed by \"moral guidance\", \"taking time to play\", and \"teaching and encouraging\". \"Financial care\" finished last.  Many men are now becoming more involved in their children's lives, and because of that many men now have a better understanding of what life is like for their child growing up in modern society.  Because fathers are immersed in their children's lives, many of the stereotypically \"manly\" attitudes and activities historically prescribed for children may be circumscribed due to a more gender-neutral parenting approach that focuses on promoting independence and emotional well being. This allows children, especially male children, to grow up with a greater capacity for empathy and less rigidity in attitudes pertaining to gender roles than would perhaps be the case in more traditionally-structured households.<ref name= Braiker>Braiker, B., Kuchment, A., & Dy, C.

He batted and threw right-handed, and was listed at {{convert|6|ft|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|168|lb|abbr=on}}. Libr\u00e1n also practiced track and field, and softball.

The following April 25, while a member of the Cubs' Double-A [[San Antonio Missions]] team, he was traded to the Padres (then in their maiden season as [[expansion team]] in the major leagues) with [[pitcher]]s [[Joe Niekro]] and [[Gary Ross (baseball)|Gary Ross]] for pitcher [[Dick Selma]]. He remained with the Missions all season and was added to the San Diego roster after September 1.\n\nLibr\u00e1n made his Major League debut as a [[shortstop]] in the {{baseball year|1969}} season.

Most notably, Libr\u00e1n played as an [[infielder]] in [[Major League Baseball]] during the late 60s. He batted and threw right-handed, and was listed at {{convert|6|ft|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|168|lb|abbr=on}}. Libr\u00e1n also practiced track and field, and softball. Because of his versatility, he is usually referred to as \"the most complete Puerto Rican athlete\". He is survived by his two daughters Yeidie J. Libr\u00e1n and Yara E.

Roosevelt [[housing project]]. He started practicing sports when he was 10 years old. Libr\u00e1n studied at the [[Interamerican University of Puerto Rico]], where he competed for the [[Liga Atl\u00e9tica Interuniversitaria de Puerto Rico]].<ref name=\"fallece\">{{cite news|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/falleceelexatletafranciscolibran-1512728.html|title=Fallece el exatleta Francisco Libr\u00e1n |work=[[El Nuevo D\u00eda]]|author=Figueroa, Alex|date=May 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Sports career==\n\nDuring his career as an athlete, Libr\u00e1n distinguished himself for practicing several sports. He played for the Vaqueros de Bayam\u00f3n of the [[Liga de Voleibol Superior Masculino|Puerto Rico volleyball league]], and in 1965 played for the [[Atl\u00e9ticos de San Germ\u00e1n]] of the [[Baloncesto Superior Nacional]]. He also practiced [[track and field]] and [[high jump]].\n\nHowever, Libr\u00e1n became more known for his career as a baseball player. Although he played mostly as a [[shortstop]], he could also play [[second baseman|second]] and [[third baseman|third base]]. In 1965, while also playing basketball, Libr\u00e1n helped the Patrulleros de San Sebasti\u00e1n of the [[Federaci\u00f3n de B\u00e9isbol Aficionado de Puerto Rico|Doble A Baseball League]] in Puerto Rico to win the championship. He also played with San Juan, Arecibo, and Caguas in the [[Liga de B\u00e9isbol Profesional Roberto Clemente|Puerto Rico Professional Baseball League]].\n\nIn 1968, Libr\u00e1n was signed by the [[Chicago Cubs]] of the [[Major League Baseball]], and spent that season split between two Class A Cub affiliates. The following April 25, while a member of the Cubs' Double-A [[San Antonio Missions]] team, he was traded to the Padres (then in their maiden season as [[expansion team]] in the major leagues) with [[pitcher]]s [[Joe Niekro]] and [[Gary Ross (baseball)|Gary Ross]] for pitcher [[Dick Selma]]. He remained with the Missions all season and was added to the San Diego roster after September 1.\n\nLibr\u00e1n made his Major League debut as a [[shortstop]] in the {{baseball year|1969}} season. In his debut game, Libr\u00e1n went [[hit (baseball)|hitless]] in two [[at bats]] against [[Woodie Fryman]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].<ref>[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1969/B09030SDN1969.htm 1969-9-3 box score from Retrosheet]</ref> Thirteen days later, he collected his only major league hit, an [[runs batted in|RBI]]-[[double (baseball)|double]] off [[Tom Griffin (baseball)|Tom Griffin]] of the [[Houston Astros]].<ref>[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1969/B09160SDN1969.htm 1969-9-16 box score from Retrosheet]</ref> Libr\u00e1n played in ten games as a Major Leaguer.\n\nAfter suffering a knee injury, Libr\u00e1n was sent to the [[minor league baseball|minor leagues]], where he played for two more years. He left the game after the 1971 campaign. Despite this injury, Libr\u00e1n continued to play in Puerto Rico for teams like [[Senadores de San Juan]], [[Lobos de Arecibo]], [[Criollos de Caguas (baseball)|Criollos de Caguas]], and [[Indios de Mayag\u00fcez]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sistematv.com/_blog/Charla_Deportiva/post/Francisco_Libr%C3%A1n/#sthash.HYXzXsna.dpuf|title=Francisco Libr\u00e1n; el deportista m\u00e1s completo de Puerto Rico|work=Sistema TV|author=Branchizio, Violeta|date=}}</ref>\n\nAfter retiring from baseball, Libr\u00e1n played [[softball]] for Mayag\u00fcez from 1977 to 1987.\n\n==Later years and death==\nAfter retiring from sports, Libr\u00e1n completed his college studies in education, and worked for 23 years for the [[Puerto Rico Department of Housing]] in Mayag\u00fcez.\n\nLibr\u00e1n died on May 16, 2013 due to complications from a surgery as a result of his condition of [[diabetes]].

Jerusalem surrendered without major bloodshed to Babylon in 597. An Israelite uprising brought the destruction of [[Nebuchadnezzar]]\u2019s army upon Jerusalem in 586 BCE. The entire city, including the [[First Temple]], was burned. Israelite aristocrats were taken captive to Babylon.\n\nThe [[Book of Ezekiel]] contains the first record of the New Jerusalem. Within {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|40-48|KJV|Ezekiel 40-48}}, there is an extended and detailed description of the measurements of the Temple, its chambers, porticos, and walls. {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|48:30\u201335|KJV}} contains a list of twelve Temple gates named for Israel\u2019s tribes.\n\nThe [[Book of Zechariah]]<ref>{{bibleref2|Zechariah|2:4-5|NIV}}</ref> expands upon Ezekiel\u2019s New Jerusalem. After the [[Second Temple]] was built after the exile, Jerusalem\u2019s population was only a few hundred. There were no defensive city walls until 445 BCE.<ref>(The rebuilding of the walls under [[Nehemiah]] is covered in the [[Book of Nehemiah]])</ref> In the passage, the author writes about a city wall of fire to protect the enormous population. This text demonstrates the beginning of a progression of New Jerusalem thought. In Ezekiel, the focus is primarily on the human act of Temple construction. In Zechariah, the focus shifts to God\u2019s intercession in the founding of New Jerusalem.\n\nNew Jerusalem is further extrapolated in Isaiah,<ref>{{bibleref2|Isaiah|54:11-14|NIV}}</ref> where New Jerusalem is adorned with precious sapphires, jewels, and rubies. The city is described as a place free from terror and full of righteousness. Here, Isaiah provides an example of Jewish [[apocalypticism]], where a hope for a perfected Jerusalem and freedom from oppression is revealed.\n\nAs the original New Jerusalem composition, Ezekiel functioned as a source for later works such as [[4 Ezra]], [[2 Baruch]], [[Qumran]] documents, and the Book of Revelation. These texts used similar measurement language and expanded on the limited eschatological perspective in Ezekiel.\n\n=== Interpretation ===\n[[Judaism]] sees the [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] as a [[human]] [[Patrilineality|male descendant]] of [[King David]] who will be anointed as the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|king of Israel]] and sit on the [[Davidic line|throne of David]] in [[Jerusalem]]. He will gather in the lost tribes of Israel, clarify unresolved issues of [[halakha]], and rebuild the [[Holy Temple in Jerusalem]] according to the pattern shown to the prophet Ezekiel. During this time Jews believe an era of global peace and prosperity will be initiated, the nations will love Israel and will abandon their gods, turn toward Jerusalem, and come to the Holy Temple to worship the one [[God in Judaism|God of Israel]]. [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] prophesied that any family among the nations who does not appear in the Temple in Jerusalem for the festival of [[Sukkoth]] will have no rain that year. [[Isaiah]] prophesied that the rebuilt Temple will be a house of prayer for all nations. The city of YHWH Shamma, the new Jerusalem, will be the gathering point of the world's nations, and will serve as the capital of the renewed [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]]. Ezekiel prophesied that this city will have 12 gates, one gate for each of the tribes of Israel. The book of Isaiah closes with the prophecy, \"And it will come to pass, that from one [[rosh hodesh|new moon]] to another, and from one [[shabbat|sabbath]] to another, all flesh will come to worship before Me, says [[YHWH]]\".\n\n=== Antiochene Persecutions, Hasmonean High Priesthood ===\nThe Animal Apocalypse within [[Book of Enoch|1 Enoch]] (chapters 85-90), is another example where conflict sparks hopes for the New Jerusalem. First Enoch is an apocalyptic response to the persecutions under Seleucid Emperor [[Antiochus IV]]. In 167 BCE, Emperor Antiochus returned from fighting in Egypt to quell a revolt in Jerusalem led by Jason, the former High Priest. An agitated Antiochus imposed harsh restrictions on Jewish religion. Circumcision, feast celebration, Sabbath observance were all banned. Antiochus ordered the burning of Torah copies. Jews were required to eat pork. The worst oppression came in the desecration of the Temple. A polytheistic cult was formed, and worship of [[YHWH]] abolished. A statue to a Seleucid deity was constructed on the Jewish altar.\n\nFirst Enoch was written in the wake of this calamity between 166 BCE-163 BCE. For the author of 1 Enoch, history is a steep descent into evil from the utopia in [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]. The author\u2019s vision of the eschaton centers on the restoration of Jerusalem: \"I saw until the owner of the sheep brought a house, new and larger and loftier than the former\" (1 Enoch 90:29). In this New Jerusalem passage, the sheep are the Jewish people, the builder is God, and the house is the Temple. During the same time period, the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] contain a New Jerusalem tradition formed out of strife. As a tiny Jewish sect living in the caves of Qumran, the [[Essenes]] opposed Temple leadership and the High Priesthood in Jerusalem. Their condemnation of the Temple focused on criticizing High Priests. They were also frustrated that Judean Kings were also given the role of High Priest.{{Dubious|date=July 2011}} The Essenes were not against the institution of the Temple and its cult per se. The Essenes at Qumran predicted the reunified twelve tribes to rise together against [[Roman Judaea|Roman occupation]] and incompetent Temple leadership and re-establish true Temple worship.\n\nThe surviving New Jerusalem texts in Qumran literature focus specifically on the twelve city gates, and on the dimensions of the entire new city. In 4Q554, the gates of Simeon, Joseph, and Reuben are mentioned in this partial fragment. For the author of this fragment, the New Jerusalem\u2019s twelve gates signify the reunification of the twelve tribes of Israel. In 5Q15, the author accompanies an angel who measures the blocks, houses, gates, avenues, streets, dining halls, and stairs of the New Jerusalem. There are two important points to consider regarding the Qumran Essenes. First, we do not have enough scroll fragments to completely analyze their New Jerusalem ideologies. Second, based on the evidence available, the Essenes rebelled against Temple leadership, not the Temple itself. Their vision of the New Jerusalem looked for the reunification of the twelve tribes around an eschatological Temple.\n\n=== 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch, 3 Baruch ===\nAs evidenced above, the historical progression of New Jerusalem language is specifically tied to conflict. The Babylonian Exile, Antiochene persecutions, and corrupt leadership in Jerusalem incited apocalyptic responses with a vision for a New Jerusalem. In the 1st century CE, an even greater conflict exploded in [[Iudaea province]]; the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Roman destruction of Jerusalem]], as well as the other [[Roman-Jewish Wars]]. Subsequent apocalyptic responses fundamentally altered the New Jerusalem eschatology for Jews and [[Early Christian]]s.\n\nAt the core, apocalypses are a form of [[theodicy]]. They respond to overwhelming suffering with the hope of divine intercession and a perfected [[World to Come]]. The destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 meant an end to [[Second Temple Judaism]]. Naturally, apocalyptic responses to the disaster followed. This section will first cover [[4 Ezra]] and [[2 Baruch]]. Fourth Ezra and 2 Baruch are important for two reasons. First, they look for a Temple in [[Heaven]], not the eschaton. Second, these texts exhibit the final new Temple texts in Judaism. Jewish texts like 3 Baruch began to reject a restored Temple completely. However, these texts were deemed to be [[apocryphal]] by the [[Rabbis]] who maintained the belief in a [[Third Temple]] as central to [[Rabbinic Judaism]].\n\nThe Jewish apocalypse of 4 Ezra is a text contained in the apocryphal book [[2 Esdras]]. The genre of 4 Ezra is [[historical fiction]], set thirteen years after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem. Fourth Ezra is dated approximately in 83 CE, thirteen years after the Roman destruction of Jerusalem. The story follows Ezra\u2019s period of mourning following Jerusalem\u2019s fall. Ezra is Job-like in his criticism of God\u2019s allowance of Jerusalem\u2019s downfall.\n\nIn Ezra\u2019s deep state of grief, he meets a woman lamenting over Jerusalem. Ezra consoles the woman, and tells her to, \"shake off your great sadness, and lay aside your many sorrows\u2026 the Most High may give you rest.\" (4 Ezra 10:24). Suddenly, the woman is transfigured in an array of bright lights. She transforms into the New Jerusalem being rebuilt. As a bereaved widow she convinced Ezra to apply solace to himself through the image of a New Jerusalem.\n\nFourth Ezra has two clear messages. First, do not grieve excessively over Jerusalem. Second, Jerusalem will be restored as a heavenly kingdom. Fourth Ezra also uses the title \"Most High,\" throughout the apocalypse to emphasis that the Lord will once again reign and reside in Jerusalem.\n\nThe apocalypse of 2 Baruch is a contemporary narrative of 4 Ezra. The text also follows the same basic structure 4 Ezra: Job-like grief, animosity towards the Lord, and the rectification of Jerusalem that leads to the comfort of the Job-figure. Second Baruch is historical fiction, written after the Roman destruction but set before the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians.\n\nBaruch is distressed when the Lord informs him of Jerusalem\u2019s impending doom. Baruch responds with several theological questions for God. For this study, Baruch\u2019s inquiry about the future of Israel and the honor of the Lord are most pertinent (2 Baruch 3:4-6). Baruch learns that the Lord will destroy the city, not the enemy. Baruch also learns of a pre-immanent heavenly Temple: \"[The Temple] was already prepared from the moment I decided to create paradise.\" And I showed it to Adam before he sinned.\" (2 Baruch 4:3). This Temple was created before Adam, and shown to him before Adam\u2019s fall.\n\nTwo important conclusions come from 2 Baruch. First, the author dismisses hopes for an earthly re-built Temple. The focus is entirely on the heavenly Temple that pre-dated the Garden of Eden. This may be a device to express the supremacy of the heavenly Temple as a sanctuary built before Eden (the traditional location of the earthly Temple). Second, Baruch believes that restoration for the people of Israel exists in heaven, not on earth.\n\nThe apocalypse of [[3 Baruch]] is the anomaly among post-revolt New Jerusalem texts. Unlike 2 Baruch and 4 Ezra, the text exemplifies an alternative tradition that lacks a restored Temple. Like other apocalypses, 3 Baruch still mourns over the Temple, and re-focuses Jews to the heavens. Yet 3 Baruch finds that the Temple is ultimately unnecessary. This move could be polemical against works which afforded the Temple with excessive veneration. In the passage, an angel comes to Baruch and consoles him over Jerusalem: \"Where is their God? And behold as I was weeping and saying such things, I saw an angel of the Lord coming and saying to me: Understand, O man, greatly beloved, and trouble not thyself so greatly concerning the salvation of Jerusalem.\" (3 Baruch 1:3)\n\nThird Baruch certainly mourns over the Temple. Yet 3 Baruch is not ultimately concerned with the lack of a Temple. This text goes along with Jeremiah and [[Sibylline Oracles]] 4 to express a minority tradition within Jewish literature. In the first Christian apocalypse, the Book of Revelation coincides with this perspective on Jerusalem. The study will now move to early Christian perspectives on the Temple and the apocalyptic response in Revelation.<ref>E.P.

In the [[Olivet discourse]] of the [[Gospel]]s, [[Jesus]] predicts the destruction of [[Herod's Temple]], and promises that it will precede the [[Son of Man#Return of the Son of Man|return of the Son of Man]], commonly called the [[Second Coming]]. This prophecy of the renewal of Jerusalem by the [[messiah]] echoes those of the Jewish prophets. [[John of Patmos]]' vision of the New Jerusalem in the Book of Revelation draws on the Olivet discourse and all the historical precursors mentioned above.\n\nBased on the Book of Revelation, [[premillennialism]] holds that, following the [[end times]] and the second creation of [[heaven]] and earth (see [[The New Earth]]), the New Jerusalem will be the earthly location where all true believers will spend eternity with God. The New Jerusalem is not limited to eschatology, however. Many Christians view the New Jerusalem as a current reality, that the New Jerusalem is the consummation of the [[Body of Christ]], the [[Christian Church|Church]] and that Christians already take part in membership of both the heavenly Jerusalem and the earthly Church in a kind of dual citizenship.<ref name=\"bess\">{{cite web|author=Bess, Philip |title=Design matters: the city and the good life: can the art of traditional urban design be renewed, and can we relearn how to create beautiful and livable cities? |work=Christian Century |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_8_120/ai_100485695 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040918173934/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_8_120/ai_100485695 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-09-18 |date=2003-04-19 |accessdate=2007-01-02 }}</ref> In this way, the New Jerusalem represents to Christians the final and everlasting reconciliation of God and his [[chosen people]], \"the end of the [[Christian pilgrimage]].\"<ref name=\"bess\"/> As such, the New Jerusalem is a conception of Heaven, see also [[Heaven (Christianity)]].\n\n=== Interpretation ===\n\nChristianity interprets the city as a physical and/or spiritual restoration or divine recreation of the city of [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]. It is also interpreted by many Christian groups as referring to the [[one true church|Church]] to be the dwelling place of the [[saint]]s.\n\n[[John of Patmos]] describes the New Jerusalem in the Book of Revelation in the [[Christian Bible]], and so the New Jerusalem holds an important place in [[Christian eschatology]] and [[Christian mysticism]], and has also influenced [[Christian philosophy]] and [[Christian theology]]. Such a renewal of Jerusalem, if a reconstruction, is an important theme in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]]. Renewed Jerusalem bears as its motto the words ''Ad librum'' (Latin: \"as by the book\".)\n\nMany traditions based on biblical scripture and other writings in the Jewish and Christian religions, such as [[Protestantism]], and [[Orthodox Judaism]], expect the literal renewal of Jerusalem to some day take place at the [[Temple Mount]] in accordance with various [[prophecy|prophecies]]. [[Dispensationalists]] believe in a literal New Jerusalem that will come down out of [[Heaven]], which will be an entirely new city of incredible dimensions. Other sects, such as various Protestant [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s, [[modernist]] branches of Christianity, [[Mormonism]] and [[Reform Judaism]], view the New Jerusalem as figurative, or believe that such a renewal may have already taken place, or that it will take place at some other location besides the [[Temple Mount]].\n\nIt is important to distinguish between \"the camp of the saints, and the beloved city\" spoken of in Revelation 20:9, and the New Jerusalem of chapter 21.\nRev. 20:9 refers to an earthly City, description and purpose of which is found in book of Ezekiel, starting with chapter 36 and ending with chapter 48.\nOne of the most obvious differences is, the dimensions of the New Jerusalem of Rev. 21 are 1000 times bigger than dimensions of the city in Ezekiel 48 (and in Rev. 20:9)\nNew Jerusalem of Revelation 21 is 2225&nbsp;km. in length, width, and height, a city of these gigantic proportions can not be located on this earth, but as stated in ch. 21 comes down from heaven on to the new earth.\n\n===The Book of Revelation===\n[[Image:BambergApocalypseFolio055rNew Jerusalem.JPG|thumb|left|Folio 55r of the [[Bamberg Apocalypse]] depicts the angel showing John the New Jerusalem, with the Lamb of God at its center.]]\n\n====Introduction to the City====\nThe term ''New Jerusalem'' occurs twice in the [[New Testament]], in verses [[Revelation 3:12]] and [[Revelation 21:2]] of the Book of Revelation. A large portion of the final two chapters of Revelation deals with John of Patmos' vision of the New Jerusalem. He describes the New Jerusalem as \"'the bride, the wife of the Lamb'\", where the river of the ''[[Water of Life (Christianity)|Water of Life]]'' flows ([[Revelation 22:1]]).\n\nAfter John witnesses the new heaven and a new earth \"that no longer has any sea\", an [[angel]] takes him \"in the Spirit\" to a vantage point on \"a great and high mountain\" to see New Jerusalem's descendants. The enormous city comes out of heaven down to [[the New Earth]]. John's elaborate description of the New Jerusalem retains many features of the Garden of Eden and the paradise garden, such as rivers, a square shape, a wall, and the [[Tree of Life]].\n\n====Description of the City====\nAccording to John, the New Jerusalem is \"pure gold, like clear glass\" and its \"brilliance [is] like a very costly stone, as a stone of crystal-clear [[jasper]].\" The street of the city is also made of \"pure gold, like transparent glass\". The base of the city is laid out in a square and surrounded by a wall made of jasper. It says in {{bibleref2|Rev|21:16|NIV|Revelation 21:16}} that the height, length, and width are of equal dimensions \u2013 as it was with the [[Holy of Holies]] in the [[Tabernacle]] and First Temple \u2013 and they measure 12,000 [[furlongs]] (which is approximately 1500.3 miles, or 1 furlong = approx 220 yards). John writes that the wall is 144 [[cubit]]s, which is assumed to be the thickness since the length is mentioned previously. 144 cubits are about equal to 65 meters, or 72 yards. It is important to note that 12 is the square root of 144. The number 12 was very important to early Jews and Christians, and represented the 12 tribes of Israel and 12 Apostles of Jesus Christ. The number symbolizes completeness in Revelation.<ref>Craig R. Koester, ''Revelation'', AB 38A. (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. 2014), 417; James. L. Resseguie, The Revelation of John: A Narrative Commentary (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2009), 32.</ref> The four sides of the New City represent the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West.) In this way, New Jerusalem is thought of as an inclusive place, with the 12 gates accepting all of the 12 tribes of Israel from all corners of the earth.\n\nThere is no temple building in the New Jerusalem. God and the Lamb are the city's temple, since they are [[worship]]ed everywhere. [[Revelation 22]] goes on to describe a river of the [[Water of Life (Christianity)|water of life]] that flows down the middle of the great street of the city from the [[Throne of God]]. The [[tree of life]] grows in the middle of the street and to both sides of the river. The tree bears twelve (kinds of) fruit and yields its fruit every month. According to John, \"The leaves of the tree were for healing (those of all) nations.\" This inclusion of the tree of life in the New Jerusalem harkens back to the Garden of Eden. The fruit the tree bears may be the fruit of life.\n\nJohn states that the New Jerusalem will be free of [[sin]]. The servants of God will have [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]] (i.e. the power or likeness of God, that is \"in his image\" of holiness) and \"His name will be on their foreheads.\" Night will no longer fall, and the inhabitants of the city will \"have need (of) no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light.\" John ends his account of the New Jerusalem by stressing its eternal nature: \"And they shall reign forever and ever.\"\n\n=====Gates=====\nThere are twelve (12) gates hanging from the wall of the New City of Jerusalem. These 12 gates are oriented in groups of three and face the four cardinal directions of the compass needle: the north, south, east and west. There is an angel at each gate, residing in a gatehouse. The 12 gates are each made of a 'single' [[pearl]], giving these the name \"[[pearly gates]]\". The names of the [[twelve tribes of Israel]] are written on the 12 gates.\n\nThe New Jerusalem gates may bear some relation to the gates mentioned in [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]], Chapters 33\u201335, where the prophet, Enoch reports that from each of the four \"heavenly gates \u2013 opening in heaven \u2013 three (new gates) were seen distinctly separating (off, as if) the extremities of the whole earth\" [were pulling apart each of the four gates into three new ones]. Thus, the four gates were each replaced by three new ones, totaling twelve [i.e. 3 x 4 = 12] gates in all. [33, 3.][ref. Laurence translation, [[Book of Enoch]].]\n\n=====Geometry=====\n[[Image:B Facundus 253v.jpg|thumb|The angel measures the New Jerusalem with the rod or reed. Note the Lamb of God and the twelve sets of figures, gates, and stones.]]\nIn 21:16, the angel measures the city with a golden rod or reed, and records it as 12,000 [[Stadia (unit of length)|stadia]] by 12,000 stadia at the base, and 12,000 stadia high. A stadion is usually stated as 185 meters, or 607 feet, so the base has dimensions of about 2220&nbsp;km by 2220&nbsp;km, or 1380 miles by 1380 miles. In the ancient Greek system of measurement, the base of the New Jerusalem would have been equal to 144 million square stadia, 4.9 million square kilometers or 1.9 million square miles (roughly midway between the sizes of [[Australia]] and [[India]]). If rested on the Earth, its ceiling would be inside the upper boundary of the [[exosphere]] but outside the lower boundary.<ref>[[Exosphere#Earth.27s exosphere]]</ref> By way of comparison, the [[International Space Station]] maintains an orbit with an altitude of about 386&nbsp;km (240&nbsp;mi) above the earth.<ref>http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/566862main_iss_fact_sheet.pdf</ref>\n\n====Revelation 21:22====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}\nThe Book of Revelation was composed during the end of the 1st century AD near the end of [[Domitian]]\u2019s reign (A.D. 96), or some date it earlier during the later end of the reign of [[Nero|Emperor Nero Domitius]] (54 to 68 CE). The work is addressed to the [[Seven churches of Asia|\"seven churches that are in Asia\"]] (1:4). Revelation is normally broken into three sections: the prologue (1:1-3:22), the visions (4:1-22:5), and the epilogue (22:6-20). This study is principally concerned with chapter 21.\n\nThe author of Revelation was both a [[Jewish Christian|Jew by birth and a believing Christian]]. For the author and the addressees of Revelation, they are searching for the Lord to vindicate them and judge the \"inhabitants of the earth,\" for their suffering (6:10). The fall of Jerusalem coupled with the Neronian persecutions form the tension within the subtext of Revelation.\n\nThroughout Revelation, several references to the Temple are made {{bibleref2|REV|3:12,7:15,11:19,14:15,16:1|NIV}}. This Temple appears to be of heavenly origin. When the eschaton arrives in {{bibleref2|REV|21:1|NIV}}, the reader expects the temple to come down from heaven with the New Jerusalem. Revelation 21 even contains typical New Jerusalem terminology that accompanies a restored Temple. Specific measurements are given for the new city (Ezekiel 40-48, 4Q554), and the city is built with gold, sapphires, and emeralds (Isaiah, Tobit). In addition, 21:21 references the \"twelve gates.\" Revelation maintains another typical aspect of New Jerusalem tradition \u2013 the reunification of the twelve tribes of Israel (Ezekiel 48:33-34, 4Q554).\n\nVerse 22 marks a sudden and remarkable shift in New Jerusalem apocalyptic rhetoric: \"I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb.\" Following with the tradition of 3 Baruch and 4 Sibylline Oracles, Revelation foresees an eschaton without the Temple. Why has the Revelation suddenly denied an eschatological Temple? Verse 23 sheds light on this disparity.\n\nVerse 23 proclaims, \"And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God is the light, and its lamp is the lamb.\" For the author of Revelation, there is no need for a Temple because the Lord will be the New Jerusalem\u2019s eternal light and Jesus (the lamb) will be its lamp. This re-interpretation utilizes Isaiah to make its case:\n\"The LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory. Your sun shall no more go down, or your moon withdraw itself; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of mourning shall be ended.\" (Isaiah 60:19)\n\nThe Temple is discarded in the eschaton because the Lord will provide illumination for the New Jerusalem, and Christ will be the glory for its residents. Henceforth, Christians believed that the New Jerusalem no longer required a Temple. For Christians, [[Supersessionism|their Lord sufficiently replaced the Temple]].\n\n=== New Jerusalem \u2013 Dead Sea Scrolls ===\nDiscovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] near [[Qumran]], [[Israel]], were fragments of a scroll which describes New Jerusalem in minute detail. The [[New Jerusalem Dead Sea Scroll|New Jerusalem Scroll]] (as it is called) appears to contain apocalyptic vision, although, being fragmented, it is hard to categorize. Written in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the text describes a vast city, rectangular in shape, with twelve gates and encircled by a long wall. Similar descriptions appear in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 40-48 and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 21-22 and comparison to the [[Temple Scroll]] (also found near Qumran) shows many similarities despite no direct literary links between the two.\n\n=== Montanism ===\nFrom the middle of the 2nd century CE to the middle of the 6th century CE, the ancient Christian sect of [[Montanism]], which spread all over the Roman Empire, expected the New Jerusalem to descend to earth at the neighboring Phrygian towns of [[Pepuza]] and [[Tymion]]. In [[late antiquity]], both places attracted crowds of pilgrims from all over the Roman Empire. [[Pepuza]] was the headquarters of the Montanist church. The Montanist patriarch resided at [[Pepuza]]. Women played an emancipated role in Montanism, serving as priests and also bishops. In the 6th century CE, this church became extinct.\n\nSince 2001, [[Peter Lampe]] of the [[University of Heidelberg]] has directed annual archaeological campaigns in Phrygia, Turkey. During these interdisciplinary campaigns, together with William Tabbernee of Tulsa, numerous unknown ancient settlements were discovered and archaeologically documented. Two of them are the best candidates so far in the search for the identification of the two holy centers of ancient Montanism, [[Pepuza]] and [[Tymion]], the sites of the expected descent of the New Jerusalem. Scholars had searched for these lost sites since the 19th century.\n\nThe ancient settlement discovered and identified as [[Pepuza]] by William Tabbernee and [[Peter Lampe]] was settled continuously from Hellenistic times to Byzantine times. In Byzantine times, an important rock-cut monastery belonged to the town. The town is in the Phrygian [[Karahall\u0131]] area, near the village of Karayakuplu ([[U\u015fak Province]], [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean Region]], [[Turkey]]). The ancient site of [[Tymion]] identified by [[Peter Lampe]] is located not far away at the Turkish village of \u015e\u00fckranje. For the Montanists, the high plane between Pepuza and Tymion was an ideal landing place for the heavenly New Jerusalem.\n\n===Catholicism===\n[[File:Schnorr_von_Carolsfeld_Bibel_in_Bildern_1860_240.png|thumb|The New Jerusalem, [[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]], 1860]]\nThe [[Catholic Church]] places the New Jerusalem in the eschatological role found in Revelation. Catholicism also holds that the New Jerusalem already exists as a spiritual community in [[Beatific vision|Heaven]], the [[Church triumphant]], with an outpost on earth, the [[Church militant]]. Together, the Church triumphant, Church militant, and [[Purgatory|Church suffering]] form the [[Church universal]]. [[Augustine of Hippo]], a [[Doctor of the Church]] and [[Church Father]], draws inspiration from John's account of the New Jerusalem to outline this view in his monumental work ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]''.\n\nThe ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article on \"Heaven\" states that Catholic\n<blockquote>theologians deem more appropriate that there should be a special and glorious abode, in which the blessed have their peculiar home and where they usually abide, even though they be free to go about in this world. For the surroundings in the midst of which the blessed have their dwelling must be in accordance with their happy state; and the internal union of charity which joins them in affection must find its outward expression in community of habitation. At the end of the world, the earth together with the celestial bodies will be gloriously transformed into a part of the dwelling-place of the blessed (Revelation 21). Hence there seems to be no sufficient reason for attributing a metaphorical sense to those numerous utterances of the Bible which suggest a definite dwelling-place of the blessed. Theologians, therefore, generally hold that the heaven of the blessed is a special place with definite limits. Naturally, this place is held to exist, not within the earth, but, in accordance with the expressions of Scripture, without and beyond its limits. All further details regarding its locality are quite uncertain. The Church has decided nothing on this subject.</blockquote>\n\n===Eastern Christianity===\nEmperor Lalibela of [[Ethiopia]] built the city of [[Lalibela]] as a new reconstructed Jerusalem in response to the [[Muslim]] capture of Jerusalem by [[Saladin]]'s forces in 1187.\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] teaches that the New Jerusalem is the City of God that will come down from heaven in the manner described in the Book of the Apocalypse (Revelation). The Church is an [[icon]] of the heavenly Jerusalem.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Averky (Taushev)\n | first = Archbishop\n | authorlink = \n | author2 = Fr.

The Puritans were inspired by the passages in Revelation about the New Jerusalem, which they interpreted as being a symbol for the [[New World]]. The Puritans saw themselves as the builders of the New Jerusalem on earth. This idea was foundational to [[American nationalism]].<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/apocalypse/explanation/puritans.html An article about the Puritans and the New Jerusalem], from [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].</ref>\n\n===Swedenborgian===\nEcclesiastic [[Swedenborgianism|Swedenborgians]] often refer to their organizations as part of or contributing to the New Jerusalem as explained by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] in such books as ''[[New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine]]'', ''[[Apocalypse Revealed]]'', and ''[[Apocalypse Explained]]''. According to Swedenborg, the New Jerusalem described in the Bible is a symbol for a new dispensation that was to replace/restore Christianity. Also according to these books, this New Jerusalem began to be established around 1757. This stems from their belief that [[Jerusalem]] itself is a symbol of the Church, and so the New Jerusalem in the Bible is a prophetic description of a New Church.\n\n===Latter Day Saint===\n{{See also|Zion (Latter Day Saints)}}\nIn the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the New Jerusalem is viewed as a physical kingdom that will be built in [[North America]],<ref>Joseph Smith, 1842, Wentworth Letter.</ref> centered on [[Independence, Missouri]].<ref>LDS Doctrine and Covenants 57:2.</ref> The movement refers to the New Jerusalem as [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]. The movement's founder, [[Joseph Smith]], attempted to establish this Zion in the early 1830s, and drafted a detailed [[plat of Zion]] based on his view of the biblical description of the New Jerusalem, including plans for a [[Temple Lot|temple]]. However, due to political and military rivalry with other Missouri settlers, members of the religion were expelled from Missouri in 1838. Subsequently, several Latter Day Saint denominations have established residence there, believing that it will be the center of God's [[Millennium|Millennial]] kingdom.\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\n{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation#The 'anointed'|l1=The 'anointed' (Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation)}}\n[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that New Jerusalem is made up of anointed Christians serving in heaven as Kings and Priests over the earth. The number of these King-Priests will eventually number 144,000. This belief is based on New Jerusalem being described as \"a bride adorned for her husband\" {{bibleref2|REV|21:2|NIV}}, and this same \"bride\" then being described as \"the Lamb's wife\" {{bibleref2|REV|21:9-10|NIV}}. {{bibleref2|REV|14:1|NIV}} is seen as depicting a wife-like relationship between the Lamb and the 144,000, therefore linking the identity of the 144,000 with the Lamb's wife and in-turn also that of New Jerusalem.<ref>Insight on the Scriptures. 2. 1988. p. 496.</ref>\n\n===Universal Friends===\nThe religious community known collectively as the Society of Universal Friends that gathered around the [[Quaker]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] known as the [[Public Universal Friend]] in the late 18th century was one of religious righteousness and devotion to Christian ideals. In 1790, the preacher founded a community called (New) Jerusalem, planned as a communal society where righteousness would prevail in the wilderness of [[New York (state)|New York's]] [[Finger Lakes]] region, in what is today the town of [[Jerusalem, New York]]. The society faded away after the death of their leader.\n\n===British Israelism===\n[[Richard Brothers]], the originator of [[British Israelism]], developed a viewpoint that the British are descended from the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]], and that the capital city of Britain should therefore be re-modeled as a New Jerusalem for the coming [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Supposedly this idea was already present in 6th Century England, and that it reached its height of influence during and just after the [[First World War]]; certain buildings, such as [[St Paul's Cathedral]], supposedly contain elements of the plan in their design.\n\n===Bedwardism===\n[[Bedwardism]], a Jamaican religious movement active between 1889 and 1921, asserted that August Town (a suburb of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]) was the New Jerusalem for the western hemisphere, and that Union Camp, where [[Alexander Bedward]]'s Free Baptist Church was located, was Zion. This movement fell apart when Bedward was arrested in 1921.\n\n===Kimbanguism===\n[[Kimbanguism]], a Congolese sectarian church founded in 1921 by [[Simon Kimbangu]], refers to Kimbangu's birthplace in Nkamba, Congo (a village near [[Mbanza-Ngungu]]), as New Jerusalem, where he reputedly performed miracles. Like Bedward, Kimbangu was imprisoned for life in the year 1921, however his movement continues with many followers to the present.\n\nThe Kimbanguist believe that people of the Nkamba village saw the New Jerusalem descending from heaven (a building) physically in 1935, by which time Father Simon Kimbangu was in prison. The Kimbanguist has constructed this same design of the building, calling it Nkamba New Jerusalem, in reference to Revelation 21; it has a river with supposed healing power.\n\n===Taiping Heavenly Kingdom===\nIn 1853, the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] captured [[Nanjing]] (Nanking) During the [[Taiping Rebellion]] against the [[Qing dynasty]] of [[China]] and renamed the city \"New Jerusalem\".<ref>http://digitalcommons.csbsju.edu/cdi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=headwaters{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith==\nThe [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] views the New Jerusalem as the renewal of religion that takes place about every thousand years and which secures the prosperity of the human world.<ref>{{cite book | title = Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World Faith | page = 381 | author = `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 |authorlink=`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 | publisher = US Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Publishing Trust | location = Willmette, IL | year = 1976}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h |authorlink=Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h |origyear=1862 |year=2003 |title=Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n: The Book of Certitude |publisher=Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=1-931847-08-8 | page = 198 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KI/ki-6.html#pg198}}</ref> [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]], the founder of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, identified the New Jerusalem with his claimed revelation (the word of God), and more specifically with the Law of God.<ref name=\"sears\">{{cite book |first=William |last=Sears |title=Thief in the Night |authorlink=William Sears (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed) |year=1961 |isbn=0-85398-008-X |publisher=George Ronald |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/thiefinnightor00sear }}</ref><ref name=\"rob1\">{{cite book |author= Taherzadeh, Adib |year= 1976 |title= The Revelation of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, Volume 1: Baghdad 1853-63 |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-270-8 | page = 306 | url = http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V1/p294-314Ch18.html}}</ref>\n\n[[`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]], Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's son, further explains that the New Jerusalem which descends from heaven is not an actual city which is renewed, but the law of God since it descends from heaven through a new revelation and it is renewed.<ref>{{cite book |author=`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 |authorlink=`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 |origyear=1904-06 |year=1981 |title=Some Answered Questions |publisher=Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-190-6| page = 67 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-13.html#pg67}}</ref>\n[[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, stated that specifically Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's book of laws, the [[Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas]], is the new Jerusalem.<ref name=\"gpb\">{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By\n|publisher=Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 | page = 213 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-13.html#pg213}}</ref><ref\nname=\"rob2\">{{cite book |last= Taherzadeh | first = Adib |authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh |year= 1984 |title= The Revelation of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, Volume 3: `Akka, The Early Years 1868-77 |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-144-2 | page = 275 | url = http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V3/p275-307Ch13.html}}</ref> Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, in the [[Tablets of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h#Lawh.-i-Karmil (Tablet of Carmel)|Tablet of Carmel]], also states that the new Jerusalem had appeared upon the new Mount Zion, [[Mount Carmel]].<ref name=\"sears\" />\n\n== Music ==\nThe Lutheran hymn \"[[Jerusalem, du hochgebaute Stadt]]\", with lyrics written by [[Johann Matth\u00e4us Meyfart]] in 1626, describes entering the Heavenly Jerusalem.

Jerusalem surrendered without major bloodshed to Babylon in 597. An Israelite uprising brought the destruction of [[Nebuchadnezzar]]\u2019s army upon Jerusalem in 586 BCE. The entire city, including the [[First Temple]], was burned. Israelite aristocrats were taken captive to Babylon.\n\nThe [[Book of Ezekiel]] contains the first record of the New Jerusalem. Within {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|40-48|KJV|Ezekiel 40-48}}, there is an extended and detailed description of the measurements of the Temple, its chambers, porticos, and walls. {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|48:30\u201335|KJV}} contains a list of twelve Temple gates named for Israel\u2019s tribes.\n\nThe [[Book of Zechariah]]<ref>{{bibleref2|Zechariah|2:4-5|NIV}}</ref> expands upon Ezekiel\u2019s New Jerusalem. After the [[Second Temple]] was built after the exile, Jerusalem\u2019s population was only a few hundred. There were no defensive city walls until 445 BCE.<ref>(The rebuilding of the walls under [[Nehemiah]] is covered in the [[Book of Nehemiah]])</ref> In the passage, the author writes about a city wall of fire to protect the enormous population. This text demonstrates the beginning of a progression of New Jerusalem thought. In Ezekiel, the focus is primarily on the human act of Temple construction. In Zechariah, the focus shifts to God\u2019s intercession in the founding of New Jerusalem.\n\nNew Jerusalem is further extrapolated in Isaiah,<ref>{{bibleref2|Isaiah|54:11-14|NIV}}</ref> where New Jerusalem is adorned with precious sapphires, jewels, and rubies. The city is described as a place free from terror and full of righteousness. Here, Isaiah provides an example of Jewish [[apocalypticism]], where a hope for a perfected Jerusalem and freedom from oppression is revealed.\n\nAs the original New Jerusalem composition, Ezekiel functioned as a source for later works such as [[4 Ezra]], [[2 Baruch]], [[Qumran]] documents, and the Book of Revelation. These texts used similar measurement language and expanded on the limited eschatological perspective in Ezekiel.\n\n=== Interpretation ===\n[[Judaism]] sees the [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] as a [[human]] [[Patrilineality|male descendant]] of [[King David]] who will be anointed as the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|king of Israel]] and sit on the [[Davidic line|throne of David]] in [[Jerusalem]]. He will gather in the lost tribes of Israel, clarify unresolved issues of [[halakha]], and rebuild the [[Holy Temple in Jerusalem]] according to the pattern shown to the prophet Ezekiel. During this time Jews believe an era of global peace and prosperity will be initiated, the nations will love Israel and will abandon their gods, turn toward Jerusalem, and come to the Holy Temple to worship the one [[God in Judaism|God of Israel]]. [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] prophesied that any family among the nations who does not appear in the Temple in Jerusalem for the festival of [[Sukkoth]] will have no rain that year. [[Isaiah]] prophesied that the rebuilt Temple will be a house of prayer for all nations. The city of YHWH Shamma, the new Jerusalem, will be the gathering point of the world's nations, and will serve as the capital of the renewed [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]]. Ezekiel prophesied that this city will have 12 gates, one gate for each of the tribes of Israel. The book of Isaiah closes with the prophecy \"And it will come to pass, that from one [[rosh hodesh|new moon]] to another, and from one [[shabbat|sabbath]] to another, all flesh will come to worship before Me, says [[YHWH]]\".\n\n=== Antiochene Persecutions, Hasmonean High Priesthood ===\nThe Animal Apocalypse within [[Book of Enoch|1 Enoch]] (chapters 85-90), is another example where conflict sparks hopes for the New Jerusalem. First Enoch is an apocalyptic response to the persecutions under Seleucid Emperor [[Antiochus IV]]. In 167 BCE, Emperor Antiochus returned from fighting in Egypt to quell a revolt in Jerusalem led by Jason, the former High Priest. An agitated Antiochus imposed harsh restrictions on Jewish religion. Circumcision, feast celebration, Sabbath observance were all banned. Antiochus ordered the burning of Torah copies. Jews were required to eat pork. The worst oppression came in the desecration of the Temple. A polytheistic cult was formed, and worship of [[YHWH]] abolished. A statue to a Seleucid deity was constructed on the Jewish altar.\n\nFirst Enoch was written in the wake of this calamity between 166 BCE-163 BCE. For the author of 1 Enoch, history is a steep descent into evil from the utopia in [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]. The author\u2019s vision of the eschaton centers on the restoration of Jerusalem: \"I saw until the owner of the sheep brought a house, new and larger and loftier than the former\" (1 Enoch 90:29). In this New Jerusalem passage, the sheep are the Jewish people, the builder is God, and the house is the Temple. During the same time period, the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] contain a New Jerusalem tradition formed out of strife. As a tiny Jewish sect living in the caves of Qumran, the [[Essenes]] opposed Temple leadership and the High Priesthood in Jerusalem. Their condemnation of the Temple focused on criticizing High Priests. They were also frustrated that Judean Kings were also given the role of High Priest.{{Dubious|date=July 2011}} The Essenes were not against the institution of the Temple and its cult per se. The Essenes at Qumran predicted the reunified twelve tribes to rise together against [[Roman Judaea|Roman occupation]] and incompetent Temple leadership and re-establish true Temple worship.\n\nThe surviving New Jerusalem texts in Qumran literature focus specifically on the twelve city gates, and on the dimensions of the entire new city. In 4Q554, the gates of Simeon, Joseph, and Reuben are mentioned in this partial fragment. For the author of this fragment, the New Jerusalem\u2019s twelve gates signify the reunification of the twelve tribes of Israel. In 5Q15, the author accompanies an angel who measures the blocks, houses, gates, avenues, streets, dining halls, and stairs of the New Jerusalem. There are two important points to consider regarding the Qumran Essenes. First, we do not have enough scroll fragments to completely analyze their New Jerusalem ideologies. Second, based on the evidence available, the Essenes rebelled against Temple leadership, not the Temple itself. Their vision of the New Jerusalem looked for the reunification of the twelve tribes around an eschatological Temple.\n\n=== 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch, 3 Baruch ===\nAs evidenced above, the historical progression of New Jerusalem language is specifically tied to conflict. The Babylonian Exile, Antiochene persecutions, and corrupt leadership in Jerusalem incited apocalyptic responses with a vision for a New Jerusalem. In the 1st century CE, an even greater conflict exploded in [[Iudaea province]]; the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Roman destruction of Jerusalem]], as well as the other [[Roman-Jewish Wars]]. Subsequent apocalyptic responses fundamentally altered the New Jerusalem eschatology for Jews and [[Early Christian]]s.\n\nAt the core, apocalypses are a form of [[theodicy]]. They respond to overwhelming suffering with the hope of divine intercession and a perfected [[World to Come]]. The destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 meant an end to [[Second Temple Judaism]]. Naturally, apocalyptic responses to the disaster followed. This section will first cover [[4 Ezra]] and [[2 Baruch]]. Fourth Ezra and 2 Baruch are important for two reasons. First, they look for a Temple in [[Heaven]], not the eschaton. Second, these texts exhibit the final new Temple texts in Judaism. Jewish texts like 3 Baruch began to reject a restored Temple completely. However, these texts were deemed to be [[apocryphal]] by the [[Rabbis]] who maintained the belief in a [[Third Temple]] as central to [[Rabbinic Judaism]].\n\nThe Jewish apocalypse of 4 Ezra is a text contained in the apocryphal book [[2 Esdras]]. The genre of 4 Ezra is [[historical fiction]], set thirteen years after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem. Fourth Ezra is dated approximately in 83 CE, thirteen years after the Roman destruction of Jerusalem. The story follows Ezra\u2019s period of mourning following Jerusalem\u2019s fall. Ezra is Job-like in his criticism of God\u2019s allowance of Jerusalem\u2019s downfall.\n\nIn Ezra\u2019s deep state of grief, he meets a woman lamenting over Jerusalem. Ezra consoles the woman, and tells her to, \"shake off your great sadness, and lay aside your many sorrows\u2026 the Most High may give you rest.\" (4 Ezra 10:24). Suddenly, the woman is transfigured in an array of bright lights. She transforms into the New Jerusalem being rebuilt. As a bereaved widow she convinced Ezra to apply solace to himself through the image of a New Jerusalem.\n\nFourth Ezra has two clear messages. First, do not grieve excessively over Jerusalem. Second, Jerusalem will be restored as a heavenly kingdom. Fourth Ezra also uses the title \"Most High,\" throughout the apocalypse to emphasis that the Lord will once again reign and reside in Jerusalem.\n\nThe apocalypse of 2 Baruch is a contemporary narrative of 4 Ezra. The text also follows the same basic structure 4 Ezra: Job-like grief, animosity towards the Lord, and the rectification of Jerusalem that leads to the comfort of the Job-figure. Second Baruch is historical fiction, written after the Roman destruction but set before the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians.\n\nBaruch is distressed when the Lord informs him of Jerusalem\u2019s impending doom. Baruch responds with several theological questions for God. For this study, Baruch\u2019s inquiry about the future of Israel and the honor of the Lord are most pertinent (2 Baruch 3:4-6). Baruch learns that the Lord will destroy the city, not the enemy. Baruch also learns of a pre-immanent heavenly Temple: \"[The Temple] was already prepared from the moment I decided to create paradise.\" And I showed it to Adam before he sinned.\" (2 Baruch 4:3). This Temple was created before Adam, and shown to him before Adam\u2019s fall.\n\nTwo important conclusions come from 2 Baruch. First, the author dismisses hopes for an earthly re-built Temple. The focus is entirely on the heavenly Temple that pre-dated the Garden of Eden. This may be a device to express the supremacy of the heavenly Temple as a sanctuary built before Eden (the traditional location of the earthly Temple). Second, Baruch believes that restoration for the people of Israel exists in heaven, not on earth.\n\nThe apocalypse of [[3 Baruch]] is the anomaly among post-revolt New Jerusalem texts. Unlike 2 Baruch and 4 Ezra, the text exemplifies an alternative tradition that lacks a restored Temple. Like other apocalypses, 3 Baruch still mourns over the Temple, and re-focuses Jews to the heavens. Yet 3 Baruch finds that the Temple is ultimately unnecessary. This move could be polemical against works which afforded the Temple with excessive veneration. In the passage, an angel comes to Baruch and consoles him over Jerusalem: \"Where is their God? And behold as I was weeping and saying such things, I saw an angel of the Lord coming and saying to me: Understand, O man, greatly beloved, and trouble not thyself so greatly concerning the salvation of Jerusalem.\" (3 Baruch 1:3)\n\nThird Baruch certainly mourns over the Temple. Yet 3 Baruch is not ultimately concerned with the lack of a Temple. This text goes along with Jeremiah and [[Sibylline Oracles]] 4 to express a minority tradition within Jewish literature. In the first Christian apocalypse, the Book of Revelation coincides with this perspective on Jerusalem. The study will now move to early Christian perspectives on the Temple and the apocalyptic response in Revelation.<ref>E.P.

In the [[Olivet discourse]] of the [[Gospel]]s, [[Jesus]] predicts the destruction of [[Herod's Temple]], and promises that it will precede the [[Son of Man#Return of the Son of Man|return of the Son of Man]], commonly called the [[Second Coming]]. This prophecy of the renewal of Jerusalem by the [[messiah]] echoes those of the Jewish prophets. [[John of Patmos]]' vision of the New Jerusalem in the Book of Revelation draws on the Olivet discourse and all the historical precursors mentioned above.\n\nBased on the Book of Revelation, [[premillennialism]] holds that, following the [[end times]] and the second creation of [[heaven]] and earth (see [[The New Earth]]), the New Jerusalem will be the earthly location where all true believers will spend eternity with God. The New Jerusalem is not limited to eschatology, however. Many Christians view the New Jerusalem as a current reality, that the New Jerusalem is the consummation of the [[Body of Christ]], the [[Christian Church|Church]] and that Christians already take part in membership of both the heavenly Jerusalem and the earthly Church in a kind of dual citizenship.<ref name=\"bess\">{{cite web|author=Bess, Philip |title=Design matters: the city and the good life: can the art of traditional urban design be renewed, and can we relearn how to create beautiful and livable cities? |work=Christian Century |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_8_120/ai_100485695 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040918173934/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_8_120/ai_100485695 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-09-18 |date=2003-04-19 |accessdate=2007-01-02 }}</ref> In this way, the New Jerusalem represents to Christians the final and everlasting reconciliation of God and his [[chosen people]], \"the end of the [[Christian pilgrimage]].\"<ref name=\"bess\"/> As such, the New Jerusalem is a conception of Heaven, see also [[Heaven (Christianity)]].\n\n=== Interpretation ===\n\nChristianity interprets the city as a physical and/or spiritual restoration or divine recreation of the city of [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]. It is also interpreted by many Christian groups as referring to the [[one true church|Church]] to be the dwelling place of the [[saint]]s.\n\n[[John of Patmos]] describes the New Jerusalem in the Book of Revelation in the [[Christian Bible]], and so the New Jerusalem holds an important place in [[Christian eschatology]] and [[Christian mysticism]], and has also influenced [[Christian philosophy]] and [[Christian theology]]. Such a renewal of Jerusalem, if a reconstruction, is an important theme in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]]. Renewed Jerusalem bears as its motto the words ''Ad librum'' (Latin: \"as by the book\".)\n\nMany traditions based on biblical scripture and other writings in the Jewish and Christian religions, such as [[Protestantism]], and [[Orthodox Judaism]], expect the literal renewal of Jerusalem to some day take place at the [[Temple Mount]] in accordance with various [[prophecy|prophecies]]. [[Dispensationalists]] believe in a literal New Jerusalem that will come down out of [[Heaven]], which will be an entirely new city of incredible dimensions. Other sects, such as various Protestant [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s, [[modernist]] branches of Christianity, [[Mormonism]] and [[Reform Judaism]], view the New Jerusalem as figurative, or believe that such a renewal may have already taken place, or that it will take place at some other location besides the [[Temple Mount]].\n\nIt is important to distinguish between \"the camp of the saints, and the beloved city\" spoken of in Revelation 20:9, and the New Jerusalem of chapter 21.\nRev. 20:9 refers to an earthly City, description and purpose of which is found in book of Ezekiel, starting with chapter 36 and ending with chapter 48.\nOne of the most obvious differences is, the dimensions of the New Jerusalem of Rev. 21 are 1000 times bigger than dimensions of the city in Ezekiel 48 (and in Rev. 20:9)\nNew Jerusalem of Revelation 21 is 2225&nbsp;km. in length, width, and height, a city of these gigantic proportions can not be located on this earth, but as stated in ch. 21 comes down from heaven on to the new earth.\n\n===The Book of Revelation===\n[[Image:BambergApocalypseFolio055rNew Jerusalem.JPG|thumb|left|Folio 55r of the [[Bamberg Apocalypse]] depicts the angel showing John the New Jerusalem, with the Lamb of God at its center.]]\n\n====Introduction to the City====\nThe term ''New Jerusalem'' occurs twice in the [[New Testament]], in verses [[Revelation 3:12]] and [[Revelation 21:2]] of the Book of Revelation. A large portion of the final two chapters of Revelation deals with John of Patmos' vision of the New Jerusalem. He describes the New Jerusalem as \"'the bride, the wife of the Lamb'\", where the river of the ''[[Water of Life (Christianity)|Water of Life]]'' flows ([[Revelation 22:1]]).\n\nAfter John witnesses the new heaven and a new earth \"that no longer has any sea\", an [[angel]] takes him \"in the Spirit\" to a vantage point on \"a great and high mountain\" to see New Jerusalem's descendants. The enormous city comes out of heaven down to [[the New Earth]]. John's elaborate description of the New Jerusalem retains many features of the Garden of Eden and the paradise garden, such as rivers, a square shape, a wall, and the [[Tree of Life]].\n\n====Description of the City====\nAccording to John, the New Jerusalem is \"pure gold, like clear glass\" and its \"brilliance [is] like a very costly stone, as a stone of crystal-clear [[jasper]].\" The street of the city is also made of \"pure gold, like transparent glass\". The base of the city is laid out in a square and surrounded by a wall made of jasper. It says in {{bibleref2|Rev|21:16|NIV|Revelation 21:16}} that the height, length, and width are of equal dimensions \u2013 as it was with the [[Holy of Holies]] in the [[Tabernacle]] and First Temple \u2013 and they measure 12,000 [[furlongs]] (which is approximately 1500.3 miles, or 1 furlong = approx 220 yards). John writes that the wall is 144 [[cubit]]s, which is assumed to be the thickness since the length is mentioned previously. 144 cubits are about equal to 65 meters, or 72 yards. It is important to note that 12 is the square root of 144. The number 12 was very important to early Jews and Christians, and represented the 12 tribes of Israel and 12 Apostles of Jesus Christ. The number symbolizes completeness in Revelation.<ref>Craig R. Koester, ''Revelation'', AB 38A. (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. 2014), 417; James. L. Resseguie, The Revelation of John: A Narrative Commentary (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2009), 32.</ref> The four sides of the New City represent the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West.) In this way, New Jerusalem is thought of as an inclusive place, with the 12 gates accepting all of the 12 tribes of Israel from all corners of the earth.\n\nThere is no temple building in the New Jerusalem. God and the Lamb are the city's temple, since they are [[worship]]ed everywhere. [[Revelation 22]] goes on to describe a river of the [[Water of Life (Christianity)|water of life]] that flows down the middle of the great street of the city from the [[Throne of God]]. The [[tree of life]] grows in the middle of the street and to both sides of the river. The tree bears twelve (kinds of) fruit and yields its fruit every month. According to John, \"The leaves of the tree were for healing (those of all) nations.\" This inclusion of the tree of life in the New Jerusalem harkens back to the Garden of Eden. The fruit the tree bears may be the fruit of life.\n\nJohn states that the New Jerusalem will be free of [[sin]]. The servants of God will have [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]] (i.e. the power or likeness of God, that is \"in his image\" of holiness) and \"His name will be on their foreheads.\" Night will no longer fall, and the inhabitants of the city will \"have need (of) no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light.\" John ends his account of the New Jerusalem by stressing its eternal nature: \"And they shall reign forever and ever.\"\n\n=====Gates=====\nThere are twelve (12) gates hanging from the wall of the New City of Jerusalem. These 12 gates are oriented in groups of three and face the four cardinal directions of the compass needle: the north, south, east and west. There is an angel at each gate, residing in a gatehouse. The 12 gates are each made of a 'single' [[pearl]], giving these the name \"[[pearly gates]]\". The names of the [[twelve tribes of Israel]] are written on the 12 gates.\n\nThe New Jerusalem gates may bear some relation to the gates mentioned in [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]], Chapters 33\u201335, where the prophet, Enoch reports that from each of the four \"heavenly gates \u2013 opening in heaven \u2013 three (new gates) were seen distinctly separating (off, as if) the extremities of the whole earth\" [were pulling apart each of the four gates into three new ones]. Thus, the four gates were each replaced by three new ones, totaling twelve [i.e. 3 x 4 = 12] gates in all. [33, 3.][ref. Laurence translation, [[Book of Enoch]].]\n\n=====Geometry=====\n[[Image:B Facundus 253v.jpg|thumb|The angel measures the New Jerusalem with the rod or reed. Note the Lamb of God and the twelve sets of figures, gates, and stones.]]\nIn 21:16, the angel measures the city with a golden rod or reed, and records it as 12,000 [[Stadia (unit of length)|stadia]] by 12,000 stadia at the base, and 12,000 stadia high. A stadion is usually stated as 185 meters, or 607 feet, so the base has dimensions of about 2220&nbsp;km by 2220&nbsp;km, or 1380 miles by 1380 miles. In the ancient Greek system of measurement, the base of the New Jerusalem would have been equal to 144 million square stadia, 4.9 million square kilometers or 1.9 million square miles (roughly midway between the sizes of [[Australia]] and [[India]]). If rested on the Earth, its ceiling would be inside the upper boundary of the [[exosphere]] but outside the lower boundary.<ref>[[Exosphere#Earth.27s exosphere]]</ref> By way of comparison, the [[International Space Station]] maintains an orbit with an altitude of about 386&nbsp;km (240&nbsp;mi) above the earth.<ref>http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/566862main_iss_fact_sheet.pdf</ref>\n\n====Revelation 21:22====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2011}}\nThe Book of Revelation was composed during the end of the 1st century AD near the end of [[Domitian]]\u2019s reign (A.D. 96), or some date it earlier during the later end of the reign of [[Nero|Emperor Nero Domitius]] (54 to 68 CE). The work is addressed to the [[Seven churches of Asia|\"seven churches that are in Asia\"]] (1:4). Revelation is normally broken into three sections: the prologue (1:1-3:22), the visions (4:1-22:5), and the epilogue (22:6-20). This study is principally concerned with chapter 21.\n\nThe author of Revelation was both a [[Jewish Christian|Jew by birth and a believing Christian]]. For the author and the addressees of Revelation, they are searching for the Lord to vindicate them and judge the \"inhabitants of the earth,\" for their suffering (6:10). The fall of Jerusalem coupled with the Neronian persecutions form the tension within the subtext of Revelation.\n\nThroughout Revelation, several references to the Temple are made {{bibleref2|REV|3:12,7:15,11:19,14:15,16:1|NIV}}. This Temple appears to be of heavenly origin. When the eschaton arrives in {{bibleref2|REV|21:1|NIV}}, the reader expects the temple to come down from heaven with the New Jerusalem. Revelation 21 even contains typical New Jerusalem terminology that accompanies a restored Temple. Specific measurements are given for the new city (Ezekiel 40-48, 4Q554), and the city is built with gold, sapphires, and emeralds (Isaiah, Tobit). In addition, 21:21 references the \"twelve gates.\" Revelation maintains another typical aspect of New Jerusalem tradition \u2013 the reunification of the twelve tribes of Israel (Ezekiel 48:33-34, 4Q554).\n\nVerse 22 marks a sudden and remarkable shift in New Jerusalem apocalyptic rhetoric: \"I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb.\" Following with the tradition of 3 Baruch and 4 Sibylline Oracles, Revelation foresees an eschaton without the Temple. Why has the Revelation suddenly denied an eschatological Temple? Verse 23 sheds light on this disparity.\n\nVerse 23 proclaims, \"And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God is the light, and its lamp is the lamb.\" For the author of Revelation, there is no need for a Temple because the Lord will be the New Jerusalem\u2019s eternal light and Jesus (the lamb) will be its lamp. This re-interpretation utilizes Isaiah to make its case:\n\"The LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory. Your sun shall no more go down, or your moon withdraw itself; for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of mourning shall be ended.\" (Isaiah 60:19)\n\nThe Temple is discarded in the eschaton because the Lord will provide illumination for the New Jerusalem, and Christ will be the glory for its residents. Henceforth, Christians believed that the New Jerusalem no longer required a Temple. For Christians, [[Supersessionism|their Lord sufficiently replaced the Temple]].\n\n=== New Jerusalem \u2013 Dead Sea Scrolls ===\nDiscovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] near [[Qumran]], [[Israel]], were fragments of a scroll which describes New Jerusalem in minute detail. The [[New Jerusalem Dead Sea Scroll|New Jerusalem Scroll]] (as it is called) appears to contain apocalyptic vision, although, being fragmented, it is hard to categorize. Written in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the text describes a vast city, rectangular in shape, with twelve gates and encircled by a long wall. Similar descriptions appear in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 40-48 and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 21-22 and comparison to the [[Temple Scroll]] (also found near Qumran) shows many similarities despite no direct literary links between the two.\n\n=== Montanism ===\nFrom the middle of the 2nd century CE to the middle of the 6th century CE, the ancient Christian sect of [[Montanism]], which spread all over the Roman Empire, expected the New Jerusalem to descend to earth at the neighboring Phrygian towns of [[Pepuza]] and [[Tymion]]. In [[late antiquity]], both places attracted crowds of pilgrims from all over the Roman Empire. [[Pepuza]] was the headquarters of the Montanist church. The Montanist patriarch resided at [[Pepuza]]. Women played an emancipated role in Montanism, serving as priests and also bishops. In the 6th century CE, this church became extinct.\n\nSince 2001, [[Peter Lampe]] of the [[University of Heidelberg]] has directed annual archaeological campaigns in Phrygia, Turkey. During these interdisciplinary campaigns, together with William Tabbernee of Tulsa, numerous unknown ancient settlements were discovered and archaeologically documented. Two of them are the best candidates so far in the search for the identification of the two holy centers of ancient Montanism, [[Pepuza]] and [[Tymion]], the sites of the expected descent of the New Jerusalem. Scholars had searched for these lost sites since the 19th century.\n\nThe ancient settlement discovered and identified as [[Pepuza]] by William Tabbernee and [[Peter Lampe]] was settled continuously from Hellenistic times to Byzantine times. In Byzantine times, an important rock-cut monastery belonged to the town. The town is in the Phrygian [[Karahall\u0131]] area, near the village of Karayakuplu ([[U\u015fak Province]], [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean Region]], [[Turkey]]). The ancient site of [[Tymion]] identified by [[Peter Lampe]] is located not far away at the Turkish village of \u015e\u00fckranje. For the Montanists, the high plane between Pepuza and Tymion was an ideal landing place for the heavenly New Jerusalem.\n\n===Catholicism===\n[[File:Schnorr_von_Carolsfeld_Bibel_in_Bildern_1860_240.png|thumb|The New Jerusalem, [[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]], 1860]]\nThe [[Catholic Church]] places the New Jerusalem in the eschatological role found in Revelation. Catholicism also holds that the New Jerusalem already exists as a spiritual community in [[Beatific vision|Heaven]], the [[Church triumphant]], with an outpost on earth, the [[Church militant]]. Together, the Church triumphant, Church militant, and [[Purgatory|Church suffering]] form the [[Church universal]]. [[Augustine of Hippo]], a [[Doctor of the Church]] and [[Church Father]], draws inspiration from John's account of the New Jerusalem to outline this view in his monumental work ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]''.\n\nThe ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article on \"Heaven\" states that Catholic\n<blockquote>theologians deem more appropriate that there should be a special and glorious abode, in which the blessed have their peculiar home and where they usually abide, even though they be free to go about in this world. For the surroundings in the midst of which the blessed have their dwelling must be in accordance with their happy state; and the internal union of charity which joins them in affection must find its outward expression in community of habitation. At the end of the world, the earth together with the celestial bodies will be gloriously transformed into a part of the dwelling-place of the blessed (Revelation 21). Hence there seems to be no sufficient reason for attributing a metaphorical sense to those numerous utterances of the Bible which suggest a definite dwelling-place of the blessed. Theologians, therefore, generally hold that the heaven of the blessed is a special place with definite limits. Naturally, this place is held to exist, not within the earth, but, in accordance with the expressions of Scripture, without and beyond its limits. All further details regarding its locality are quite uncertain. The Church has decided nothing on this subject.</blockquote>\n\n===Eastern Christianity===\nEmperor Lalibela of [[Ethiopia]] built the city of [[Lalibela]] as a new reconstructed Jerusalem in response to the [[Muslim]] capture of Jerusalem by [[Saladin]]'s forces in 1187.\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] teaches that the New Jerusalem is the City of God that will come down from heaven in the manner described in the Book of the Apocalypse (Revelation). The Church is an [[icon]] of the heavenly Jerusalem.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Averky (Taushev)\n | first = Archbishop\n | authorlink = \n | author2 = Fr.

The Puritans were inspired by the passages in Revelation about the New Jerusalem, which they interpreted as being a symbol for the [[New World]]. The Puritans saw themselves as the builders of the New Jerusalem on earth. This idea was foundational to [[American nationalism]].<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/apocalypse/explanation/puritans.html An article about the Puritans and the New Jerusalem], from [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].</ref>\n\n===Swedenborgian===\nEcclesiastic [[Swedenborgianism|Swedenborgians]] often refer to their organizations as part of or contributing to the New Jerusalem as explained by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] in such books as ''[[New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine]]'', ''[[Apocalypse Revealed]]'', and ''[[Apocalypse Explained]]''. According to Swedenborg, the New Jerusalem described in the Bible is a symbol for a new dispensation that was to replace/restore Christianity. Also according to these books, this New Jerusalem began to be established around 1757. This stems from their belief that [[Jerusalem]] itself is a symbol of the Church, and so the New Jerusalem in the Bible is a prophetic description of a New Church.\n\n===Latter Day Saint===\n{{See also|Zion (Latter Day Saints)}}\nIn the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the New Jerusalem is viewed as a physical kingdom that will be built in [[North America]],<ref>Joseph Smith, 1842, Wentworth Letter.</ref> centered on [[Independence, Missouri]].<ref>LDS Doctrine and Covenants 57:2.</ref> The movement refers to the New Jerusalem as [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]. The movement's founder, [[Joseph Smith]], attempted to establish this Zion in the early 1830s, and drafted a detailed [[plat of Zion]] based on his view of the biblical description of the New Jerusalem, including plans for a [[Temple Lot|temple]]. However, due to political and military rivalry with other Missouri settlers, members of the religion were expelled from Missouri in 1838. Subsequently, several Latter Day Saint denominations have established residence there, believing that it will be the center of God's [[Millennium|Millennial]] kingdom.\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\n{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation#The 'anointed'|l1=The 'anointed' (Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation)}}\n[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that New Jerusalem is made up of anointed Christians serving in heaven as Kings and Priests over the earth. The number of these King-Priests will eventually number 144,000. This belief is based on New Jerusalem being described as \"a bride adorned for her husband\" {{bibleref2|REV|21:2|NIV}}, and this same \"bride\" then being described as \"the Lamb's wife\" {{bibleref2|REV|21:9-10|NIV}}. {{bibleref2|REV|14:1|NIV}} is seen as depicting a wife-like relationship between the Lamb and the 144,000, therefore linking the identity of the 144,000 with the Lamb's wife and in-turn also that of New Jerusalem.<ref>Insight on the Scriptures. 2. 1988. p. 496.</ref>\n\n===Universal Friends===\nThe religious community known collectively as the Society of Universal Friends that gathered around the [[Quaker]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] known as the [[Public Universal Friend]] in the late 18th century was one of religious righteousness and devotion to Christian ideals. In 1790, the preacher founded a community called (New) Jerusalem, planned as a communal society where righteousness would prevail in the wilderness of [[New York (state)|New York's]] [[Finger Lakes]] region, in what is today the town of [[Jerusalem, New York]]. The society faded away after the death of their leader.\n\n===British Israelism===\n[[Richard Brothers]], the originator of [[British Israelism]], developed a viewpoint that the British are descended from the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]], and that the capital city of Britain should therefore be re-modeled as a New Jerusalem for the coming [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Supposedly this idea was already present in 6th Century England, and that it reached its height of influence during and just after the [[First World War]]; certain buildings, such as [[St Paul's Cathedral]], supposedly contain elements of the plan in their design.\n\n===Bedwardism===\n[[Bedwardism]], a Jamaican religious movement active between 1889 and 1921, asserted that August Town (a suburb of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]) was the New Jerusalem for the western hemisphere, and that Union Camp, where [[Alexander Bedward]]'s Free Baptist Church was located, was Zion. This movement fell apart when Bedward was arrested in 1921.\n\n===Kimbanguism===\n[[Kimbanguism]], a Congolese sectarian church founded in 1921 by [[Simon Kimbangu]], refers to Kimbangu's birthplace in Nkamba, Congo (a village near [[Mbanza-Ngungu]]), as New Jerusalem, where he reputedly performed miracles. Like Bedward, Kimbangu was imprisoned for life in the year 1921, however his movement continues with many followers to the present.\n\nThe Kimbanguist believe that people of the Nkamba village saw the New Jerusalem descending from heaven (a building) physically in 1935, by which time Father Simon Kimbangu was in prison. The Kimbanguist has constructed this same design of the building, calling it Nkamba New Jerusalem, in reference to Revelation 21; it has a river with supposed healing power.\n\n===Taiping Heavenly Kingdom===\nIn 1853, the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] captured [[Nanjing]] (Nanking) During the [[Taiping Rebellion]] against the [[Qing dynasty]] of [[China]] and renamed the city \"New Jerusalem\".<ref>http://digitalcommons.csbsju.edu/cdi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=headwaters{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith==\nThe [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] views the New Jerusalem as the renewal of religion that takes place about every thousand years and which secures the prosperity of the human world.<ref>{{cite book | title = Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World Faith | page = 381 | author = `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 |authorlink=`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 | publisher = US Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Publishing Trust | location = Willmette, IL | year = 1976}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h |authorlink=Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h |origyear=1862 |year=2003 |title=Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n: The Book of Certitude |publisher=Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=1-931847-08-8 | page = 198 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KI/ki-6.html#pg198}}</ref> [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]], the founder of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, identified the New Jerusalem with his claimed revelation (the word of God), and more specifically with the Law of God.<ref name=\"sears\">{{cite book |first=William |last=Sears |title=Thief in the Night |authorlink=William Sears (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed) |year=1961 |isbn=0-85398-008-X |publisher=George Ronald |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/thiefinnightor00sear }}</ref><ref name=\"rob1\">{{cite book |author= Taherzadeh, Adib |year= 1976 |title= The Revelation of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, Volume 1: Baghdad 1853-63 |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-270-8 | page = 306 | url = http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V1/p294-314Ch18.html}}</ref>\n\n[[`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]], Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's son, further explains that the New Jerusalem which descends from heaven is not an actual city which is renewed, but the law of God since it descends from heaven through a new revelation and it is renewed.<ref>{{cite book |author=`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 |authorlink=`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 |origyear=1904-06 |year=1981 |title=Some Answered Questions |publisher=Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-190-6| page = 67 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-13.html#pg67}}</ref>\n[[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, stated that specifically Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's book of laws, the [[Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas]], is the new Jerusalem.<ref name=\"gpb\">{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By\n|publisher=Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 | page = 213 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-13.html#pg213}}</ref><ref\nname=\"rob2\">{{cite book |last= Taherzadeh | first = Adib |authorlink= Adib Taherzadeh |year= 1984 |title= The Revelation of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, Volume 3: `Akka, The Early Years 1868-77 |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |isbn= 0-85398-144-2 | page = 275 | url = http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha%27i/Others/ROB/V3/p275-307Ch13.html}}</ref> Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, in the [[Tablets of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h#Lawh.-i-Karmil (Tablet of Carmel)|Tablet of Carmel]], also states that the new Jerusalem had appeared upon the new Mount Zion, [[Mount Carmel]].<ref name=\"sears\" />\n\n== Music ==\nThe Lutheran hymn \"[[Jerusalem, du hochgebaute Stadt]]\", with lyrics written by [[Johann Matth\u00e4us Meyfart]] in 1626, describes entering the Heavenly Jerusalem.
