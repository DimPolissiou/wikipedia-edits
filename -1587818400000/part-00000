Smith continued to experiment and improve on his designs over the coming years and it was one of his last designs, [[Start Point, Sanday]] (1806), which incorporated a revolving light which was to become universal. \n\nSmith stepped-down from his role with the Northern Lighthouse Board in 1808 and was succeeded by his stepson [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]]. However, he remained active in his private business. \n\n==Family life==\n\nIn 1792 - five years after his appointment to the Northern Lighthouse Board - Smith married his third wife, Jean Lille Stevenson (1751-1820). \n\nPrior to this, Smith had been twice widowed. He had five children by his first wife, though only a daughter (Jane) and son (James) survived infancy. He had one further daughter (Mary-Anne), by his second wife.\n\nJean Lille Stevenson was herself a widow, with a young son called Robert Stevenson. Her first husband was Alan Stevenson, a partner in a [[West Indies]] sugar trading house in [[Glasgow]] who died of epidemic fever on the island of [[Saint Kitts|St. Christopher]] in the West Indies in 1774 leaving Jean Lille in precarious financial circumstances.\n\nThe new family initially lived at 1 Blair Street off the [[Royal Mile]] in [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's Old Town]],<ref>Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1790</ref> before moving to the then newly built 2 Baxter's Place at the head of [[Leith Walk]] in 1798/9.<ref>Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1815</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Thomas Smith and his step-son Robert Stevenson proved to be close and admiring. Though Stevenson\u2019s mother had intended him for a career in the ministry, he instead became a keen assistant to his step-father\u2019s works and was formally apprenticed to Smith in 1791. This relationship was further cemented by an unusual circumstance: in 1799 Stevenson married his then 20 year old step-sister Jane.<ref name=\":2\" /> The following year, Stevenson became a full partner in Smith\u2019s firm and eventually succeeded him as Chief Engineer to the Northern Lighthouse Board in 1808, initiating a dynasty of Stevenson\u2019s as lighthouse builders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlb.org.uk/history/stevenson-engineers/|title=Stevenson engineers \u2013 Northern Lighthouse Board|website=www.nlb.org.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nLittle is known about Thomas Smith\u2019s own son James except that he left home to found his own ironmongery business, but whether this was due to some rift with his father is unknown.<ref name=\":2\" /> His daughter Janet was mother to the physicist [[William Swan (physicist)|William Swan]]. \n\nSmith died at home in 2 Baxter's Place in on 21 June 1815, aged 62.

He was commissioned to build the first four modern lighthouses and promptly dispatched to south to pick-up technical expertise from an English lighthouse builder (possibly [[John Smeaton]], who built the pioneering third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] in the 1750s, or perhaps Ezekiel Walker or [[William Hutchinson (privateer)|William Hutchinson]]).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nUpon his return Smith set about the construction of the four new lighthouses at [[Kinnaird Head Lighthouse|Kinnaird Head]], [[Mull of Kintyre]], [[Eilean Glas, Scalpay|Eilean Glas]], and [[North Ronaldsay]]. As well as the design and construction, Smith had to overcome significant financial, logistical and supply-chain challenges resulting from the remote locations of the projects.<ref name=\":0\" /> Nonetheless, all four lighthouses were successfully constructed. \n\nSmith quickly adopted the newly invented [[Argand lamp]], which with its circular wick and glass chimney gave a much brighter light than traditional wick lamps. Most significantly, he combined this with his parabolic reflectors resulting in a combination which came to be known as the [[Catoptrics|catoptric system]] and set the standard for lighthouse illumination at that time.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=NANCOLLAS, TOM.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1078162393|title=SEASHAKEN HOUSES : a lighthouse history from eddystone to fastnet.|date=2019|publisher=PENGUIN Books|isbn=1-84614-938-X|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=1078162393}}</ref>\n\nThe first of his lighthouses - Kinnaird Head (1787) - had 17 [[Whale oil|whale-oil]] lamps backed by parabolic reflectors and was said to be the most powerful light of its day<ref name=\":1\" /> with a reported range of 12 to 14 miles (10 to 12 mmi; 19 to 23km). Smith continued to experiment and improve on his designs over the coming years and it was one of his last designs, [[Start Point, Sanday]] (1806), which incorporated a revolving light which was to become universal. \n\nSmith stepped-down from his role with the Northern Lighthouse Board in 1808 and was succeeded by his stepson [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]]. However, he remained active in his private business. \n\n==Family life==\n\nIn 1792 - five years after his appointment to the Northern Lighthouse Board - Smith married his third wife, Jean Lille Stevenson (1751-1820). \n\nPrior to this, Smith had been twice widowed. He had five children by his first wife, though only a daughter (Jane) and son (James) survived infancy. He had one further daughter (Mary-Anne), by his second wife.\n\nJean Lille Stevenson was herself a widow, with a young son called Robert Stevenson. Her first husband was Alan Stevenson, a partner in a [[West Indies]] sugar trading house in [[Glasgow]] who died of epidemic fever on the island of [[Saint Kitts|St. Christopher]] in the West Indies in 1774 leaving Jean Lille in precarious financial circumstances.\n\nThe new family initially lived at 1 Blair Street off the [[Royal Mile]] in [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's Old Town]],<ref>Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1790</ref> before moving to the then newly built 2 Baxter's Place at the head of [[Leith Walk]] in 1798/9.<ref>Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1815</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Thomas Smith and his step-son Robert Stevenson proved to be close and admiring. Though Stevenson\u2019s mother had intended him for a career in the ministry, he instead became a keen assistant to his step-father\u2019s works and was formally apprenticed to Smith in 1791. This relationship was further cemented by an unusual circumstance: in 1799 Stevenson married his then 20 year old step-sister Jane.<ref name=\":2\" /> The following year, Stevenson became a full partner in Smith\u2019s firm and eventually succeeded him as Chief Engineer to the Northern Lighthouse Board in 1808, initiating a dynasty of Stevenson\u2019s as lighthouse builders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlb.org.uk/history/stevenson-engineers/|title=Stevenson engineers \u2013 Northern Lighthouse Board|website=www.nlb.org.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nLittle is known about Thomas Smith\u2019s own son James except that he left home to found his own ironmongery business, but whether this was due to some rift with his father is unknown.<ref name=\":2\" /> His daughter Janet was mother to the physicist [[William Swan (physicist)|William Swan]]. \n\nSmith died at home in 2 Baxter's Place in on 21 June 1815, aged 62. He is buried in the north-east section of [[Old Calton Burial Ground]].
