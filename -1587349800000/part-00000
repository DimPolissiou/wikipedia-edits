Donnelley agreed that the support would be needed for the many tons of paper they used and large presses they operated. Supported by 4,675 steel-[[reinforced concrete column]]s, this type of construction not only served the Donnelly well, it also provided the perfect infrastructure for future tenants. To further the building's support structure, reinforcing bars, normally laid perpendicular, were laid at various angles enabling the floors to bear loads of at least 250 pounds per square foot.\n\nCurrent major tenants of the building include the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]], Telx, [[Equinix]], [[Steadfast Networks]] and [[CenturyLink]].\n\nExterior ornaments depict symbols of printing history.

The newly outfitted building was the first and largest planned carrier hotel in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Feature-Lakeside Tech Center|url=http://www.progressiveengineer.com/pewebbackissues2004/PEWeb%2048%20Mar%2004-2/Lakeside.htm|publisher=Progressive Engineer|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref>\n\nThe building was designed by [[Howard Van Doren Shaw]] to be a fireproof design of poured [[reinforced concrete]] columns and an open-shell concrete floor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Serving, Saving & Saluting the South Loop|url=http://www.lib.colum.edu/archhistory/shaw.htm|publisher=Columbia College Chicago|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> Although considered to be expensive by the standards of that time, T.E. Donnelley agreed that the support would be needed for the many tons of paper they used and large presses they operated. Supported by 4,675 steel-[[reinforced concrete column]]s, this type of construction not only served the Donnelly well, it also provided the perfect infrastructure for future tenants. To further the building's support structure, reinforcing bars, normally laid perpendicular, were laid at various angles enabling the floors to bear loads of at least 250 pounds per square foot.\n\nCurrent major tenants of the building include the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]], Telx, [[Equinix]], [[Steadfast Networks]] and [[CenturyLink]].\n\nExterior ornaments depict symbols of printing history.  Portions of the building, including the interior Memorial Library, were designed by architect [[Charles Klauder]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Calumet Plant R R Donnelly and Sons Company E Chicago IL.jpg|View from west\nFile:Calumet Plant R R Donnelly and Sons Company A Chicago IL.jpg|Corner tower\nFile:Calumet Plant R R Donnelly and Sons Company C Chicago IL.jpg|Base of tower\nFile:Calumet Plant R R Donnelly and Sons Company D Chicago IL.jpg|Detail of piers\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lakeside Press Building]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commonscat|R.R.

The settlement was not officially known as Quakertown until its first post office opened in 1803.<ref name=\"boro\">{{cite web |title=History |publisher=Borough of Quakertown |url=http://www.quakertownboro.com/index.aspx?page=40 |accessdate=November 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Liberty Bell moved===\nOn September 18, 1777, during the [[American Revolutionary War]], a convoy of wagons carrying the [[Liberty Bell]] from [[Philadelphia]] to [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], under the command of Col. [[Thomas Polk]] of Charlotte, North Carolina, stopped in Quakertown. The Liberty Bell was stored overnight behind the home of Evan Foulke (1237 West Broad Street), and the entourage stayed at the Red Lion Inn. The [[John Fries' Rebellion]] was also started in the Red Lion Inn in 1799.\n\n===1800s growth===\nIn 1854, Quakertown elected its first Burgess. The [[North Pennsylvania Railroad]] caused a great increase in population, and by 1880, the population of Quakertown had almost reached 1,800.<ref name=\"boro\"/>\n\n[[Liberty Hall (Quakertown, Pennsylvania)|Liberty Hall]], [[Quakertown Historic District]], [[Quakertown Passenger and Freight Station]], and [[Enoch Roberts House]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}\n</ref><gallery mode=packed eights=180>\nFile:Quakertown Friends PA 2.jpg|Richland Friends Meeting House, the Quaker meeting house in Quakertown\nLiberty Hall Quakertown PA.jpg|[[Liberty Hall (Quakertown, Pennsylvania)|Liberty Hall]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Industry and population===\nThe [[American Civil War]] along with national economic expansion changed Quakertown from a tiny village to a commercial manufacturing center.  In the nineteenth century, local industrial establishments included [[cigar]] and [[cigar box]] factories, silk mills, harness factories, and stove foundries. Until 1969, Quakertown generated its own [[electrical power]]. As of 2020, Quakertown has extensive mall development along Pennsylvania Route 309 that includes many restaurants, businesses, and retail outlets. The population of Quakertown in 1900 was 3,014; it rose to 3,801 in 1910. By 1940, the population had reached 5,150 people. At the 2010 census, the borough's population was 8,979.\n\n===Interurban to Allentown and Philadelphia===\nBetween 1901 and 1951, Quakertown was an hourly stop on the Lehigh Valley Transit Company's electric interurban trolley line from Allentown and Coopersburg through Quakertown then south through Perkasie, Sellersville, Souderton, Lansdale, and Norristown to Philadelphia. In World War 2 during gasoline rationing with car use limited it moved a very large number of passengers. After the war, its business collapsed, and it quit in 1951. The LVT station at the northwest corner of Main and Broad streets across from the Red Lion Inn still stands and is marked on one wall for that history. It ran in the center of Main Street as it progressed southbound to Perkasie.<ref>Lehigh Valley Transit Company's Liberty Bell Route : A Photographic History with Chronology, Historical Recollections and Bibliography:  William J McKelvey Jr</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|2.0|sqmi}}, all of it land.\n\n[[Licking Run (Beaver Run)|Licking Run]] begins in passes through Quakertown from the west to the east and drains into the Tohickon Creek.

The Liberty Bell was stored overnight behind the home of Evan Foulke (1237 West Broad Street), and the entourage stayed at the Red Lion Inn.

In the nineteenth century, local industrial establishments included [[cigar]] and [[cigar box]] factories, silk mills, harness factories, and stove foundries. Until 1969, Quakertown generated its own [[electrical power]]. As of 2020, Quakertown has extensive mall development along Pennsylvania Route 309 that includes many restaurants, businesses, and retail outlets. The population of Quakertown in 1900 was 3,014; it rose to 3,801 in 1910. By 1940, the population had reached 5,150 people. At the 2010 census, the borough's population was 8,979.\n\n===Interurban to Allentown and Philadelphia===\nBetween 1901 and 1951, Quakertown was an hourly stop on the Lehigh Valley Transit Company's electric interurban trolley line from Allentown and Coopersburg through Quakertown then south through Perkasie, Sellersville, Souderton, Lansdale, and Norristown to Philadelphia. In World War 2 during gasoline rationing with car use limited it moved a very large number of passengers. After the war, its business collapsed, and it quit in 1951. The LVT station at the northwest corner of Main and Broad streets across from the Red Lion Inn still stands and is marked on one wall for that history.

His father Gaius Allen, who came from [[Acton, Massachusetts|Acton]], was a former soldier who served in the Davis Blues Regiment during the [[War of 1812]]. As a young man, Nathaniel worked in Boston as a watchmaker. When the civil war broke out on April 12, 1861, he immediately enlisted into the [[1st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]] as a Private, on May 22, 1861, aged 21.<ref name=\"actonmemoriallibrary2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.actonmemoriallibrary.org/civilwar/records/Allen_NM.htm |title=Civil War Records of Nathaniel M.

It was considered the turning point in the Civil War.<ref>Rawley, p. 147.</ref> It also created the highest number of casualties of the Civil War, with 23,055 Union troops killed, missing in action or wounded;<ref>Busey and Martin, p. 125.</ref> and 23,231 Confederate casualties.<ref>Busey and Martin, p. 260.</ref>\n\nAllen's battle started on July 2, one day into the battle. In the afternoon of that day, his regiment came under heavy small-arms fire from advancing Confederate infantry. In the midst of the fight, he was given the Regiment's U.S. flag from his wounded ensign William Eaton. Allen's commander then ordered the regiment to retreat from the advancing Confederates. Whilst retreating, Allen saw Sergeant William Kelren shot and killed - dropping the regimental flag beneath him. Allen immediately retrieved the flag from underneath Kelren\u2019s body. He then ran back to his retreating regiment carrying both flags safely from the battlefield. It was for this action he was awarded the Medal of Honor. More than half of Allen\u2019s regiment were killed or wounded in the battle.\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Nathaniel Allen grave marker.jpg|thumb|Grave marker in the Acton [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Acton, Massachusetts)|Woodlawn Cemetery]]]]\nAfter the Civil War ended, Nathaniel returned to Boston where he continued his old trade as a watchmaker. Several years later, however, Nathaniel's eyesight began to fail, making it impossible to work as a watchmaker. He then moved in with his sisters in South Acton, where he lived for the rest of his life. Nathaniel was awarded his medal of honor on 29 March 1899. 36 years after the Battle of Gettysburg.

His father Gaius Allen, who came from [[Acton, Massachusetts|Acton]], was a former soldier who served in the Davis Blues Regiment during the [[War of 1812]]. As a young man, Nathaniel worked in Boston as a watchmaker. When the civil war broke out on April 12, 1861, he immediately enlisted into the [[1st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]] as a Private, on May 22, 1861, aged 21.<ref name=\"actonmemoriallibrary2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.actonmemoriallibrary.org/civilwar/records/Allen_NM.htm |title=Civil War Records of Nathaniel M.

It was considered the turning point in the Civil War.<ref>Rawley, p. 147.</ref> It also created the highest number of casualties of the Civil War, with 23,055 Union troops killed, missing in action or wounded;<ref>Busey and Martin, p. 125.</ref> and 23,231 Confederate casualties.<ref>Busey and Martin, p. 260.</ref>\n\nAllen's battle started on July 2, one day into the battle. In the afternoon of that day, his regiment came under heavy small-arms fire from advancing Confederate infantry. In the midst of the fight, he was given the Regiment's U.S. flag from his wounded ensign William Eaton. Allen's commander then ordered the regiment to retreat from the advancing Confederates. Whilst retreating, Allen saw Sergeant William Kelren shot and killed - dropping the regimental flag beneath him. Allen immediately retrieved the flag from underneath Kelren\u2019s body. He then ran back to his retreating regiment carrying both flags safely from the battlefield. It was for this action he was awarded the Medal of Honor. More than half of Allen\u2019s regiment were killed or wounded in the battle.\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Nathaniel Allen grave marker.jpg|thumb|Grave marker in the Acton [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Acton, Massachusetts)|Woodlawn Cemetery]]]]\nAfter the Civil War ended, Nathaniel returned to Boston where he continued his old trade as a watchmaker. Several years later, however, Nathaniel's eyesight began to fail, making it impossible to work as a watchmaker. He then moved in with his sisters in South Acton, where he lived for the rest of his life. Nathaniel was awarded his medal of honor on 29 March 1899. 36 years after the Battle of Gettysburg. Of the 1,527 Medals of Honor awarded for action in the Civil War, more than half were for capturing the flag of an enemy force or preventing one\u2019s own flag from being captured.

The first settlement that included non-indigenous people was in 1772, when Reverend John Ettwein, a [[Moravian Church]] missionary, arrived with a band of 241 Christianized [[Delaware Indians]].<ref name=Guide>''Pennsylvania: A Guide to the Keystone State'' (Illustrated). Oxford University Press, 1940. University of Pennsylvania, Federal Works Agency. p. 568. Google Books.</ref><ref name=WPA>''The WPA Guide to Pennsylvania: The Keystone State''. Trinity University Press, 2013. p. 568. Google Books, & Amazon Kindle.</ref> Swarms of [[gnats]] plagued early settlers and their livestock for years, and are blamed for Ettwein's failure to establish a permanent settlement there.<ref name=Guide/> The clouds of biting gnats eventually drove the Indians away. The Indians called the insects ''ponkies'' (living dust and ashes), and called their village ''Ponkis Utenink'' (land of the ponkies), from which the present name Punxsutawney evolved. One legend about the origin of the term ''ponkies'' concerned an old Indian sorcerer-hermit who was said to have long terrorized Indians in the region. Eventually he was killed, his body burned, and his ashes were cast to the wind. According to the story, the ashes were transformed into minute living things that infested the swamp land.<ref name=McKnight>McKnight, William J., M.D. ''A Pioneer History of Jefferson County, Pennsylvania''.

''A Pioneer Outline History of Northwestern Pennsylvania'' (Illustrated). J.B. Lippincott Company, 1905. Donation Lands. Google Books.</ref> Another story about the source of the term asserted that the Indians compared the insect bites to burns caused by sparks or hot ashes.<ref name=Guide/>\n\nThe area was originally settled by the [[Lenape]] (Delaware Native Americans), and a more definitive source says the name \"Punxsutawney\" derives from a Native name in [[Unami language|Unami]] (a Lenape language): ''{{lang|unm|Punkwsut\u00e8nay}}'', which translates to \"town of the [[Sandfly|sandflies]]\" or \"town of the [[mosquito]]es\" (''{{lang|unm|punkw\u00ebs}}''- \u2018mosquito\u2019 + -''{{lang|unm|ut\u00e8nay}}'' \u2018town\u2019).<ref name=Lenape/>\nAlternatively, the name is said to come from another Unami term, ''{{lang|unm|Put'schisk'tey}}'', which means \"[[poison vine]].\"<ref>Brinton, Daniel G., C.F.

By 1840 it was reported that Punxsutawney was a village of about 15 or 20 dwellings.<ref name=Pioneer/> Settlers drawn by lumbering and coal mining eventually drained the swamps and exterminated the insects.<ref name=Guide/> The Borough of Punxsutawney was incorporated in 1850,<ref name=incorp/> and had a reported population of 256 at that time. In 1907, Punxsutawney and [[Claysville]] boroughs were consolidated and incorporated as Greater Punxsutawney, resulting in a combined population of 9,058 by 1910. A high-grade [[Bituminous coal|bituminous soft coal]] was mined in the surrounding region. Shortly after 1850, mining was being supplanted by factories which included brickworks, glassworks, tanneries, foundries, ironworks, machine shops, and wood planing, flour, feed, and silk mills. By the 1930s these were mostly gone, and townspeople were dependent largely on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad repair shops north of town, and a meat packing plant, in addition to the remaining coal mining and batteries of beehive [[coke oven]]s.<ref name=Guide/> In 1900, 6,746 people lived in Punxsutawney before the consolidation with Claysville. After consolidation, the population in 1910 was 9,058; in 1920, 10,311; in 1930, 9,266; prewar in 1940, 9,482; and postwar in 1950, 8,969 people lived there. The population was 5,962 at the 2010 census.\n\nPunxsutawney's most famous resident is [[Punxsutawney Phil]], a [[groundhog]] said to predict the weather annually on [[Groundhog Day]] (February 2).

The first settlement that included non-indigenous people was in 1772, when Reverend John Ettwein, a [[Moravian Church]] missionary, arrived with a band of 241 Christianized [[Delaware Indians]].<ref name=Guide>''Pennsylvania: A Guide to the Keystone State'' (Illustrated).

Trinity University Press, 2013. p. 568. Google Books, & Amazon Kindle.</ref> Swarms of [[gnats]] plagued early settlers and their livestock for years, and are blamed for Ettwein's failure to establish a permanent settlement there.<ref name=Guide/> The clouds of biting gnats eventually drove the Indians away. The Indians called the insects ''ponkies'' (living dust and ashes), and called their village ''Ponkis Utenink'' (land of the ponkies), from which the present name Punxsutawney evolved. One legend about the origin of the term ''ponkies'' concerned an old Indian sorcerer-hermit who was said to have long terrorized Indians in the region. Eventually he was killed, his body burned, and his ashes were cast to the wind. According to the story, the ashes were transformed into minute living things that infested the swamp land.<ref name=McKnight>McKnight, William J., M.D. ''A Pioneer History of Jefferson County, Pennsylvania''.

''A Pioneer Outline History of Northwestern Pennsylvania'' (Illustrated). J.B. Lippincott Company, 1905. Donation Lands. Google Books.</ref> Another story about the source of the term asserted that the Indians compared the insect bites to burns caused by sparks or hot ashes.<ref name=Guide/>\n\nThe area was originally settled by the [[Lenape]] (Delaware Native Americans), and a more definitive source says the name \"Punxsutawney\" derives from a Native name in [[Unami language|Unami]] (a Lenape language): ''{{lang|unm|Punkwsut\u00e8nay}}'', which translates to \"town of the [[Sandfly|sandflies]]\" or \"town of the [[mosquito]]es\" (''{{lang|unm|punkw\u00ebs}}''- \u2018mosquito\u2019 + -''{{lang|unm|ut\u00e8nay}}'' \u2018town\u2019).<ref name=Lenape/>\nAlternatively, the name is said to come from another Unami term, ''{{lang|unm|Put'schisk'tey}}'', which means \"[[poison vine]].\"<ref>Brinton, Daniel G., C.F.

In 1907, Punxsutawney and [[Claysville]] boroughs were consolidated and incorporated as Greater Punxsutawney, resulting in a combined population of 9,058 by 1910. A high-grade [[Bituminous coal|bituminous soft coal]] was mined in the surrounding region. Shortly after 1850, mining was being supplanted by factories which included brickworks, glassworks, tanneries, foundries, ironworks, machine shops, and wood planing, flour, feed, and silk mills. By the 1930s these were mostly gone, and townspeople were dependent largely on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad repair shops north of town, and a meat packing plant, in addition to the remaining coal mining and batteries of beehive [[coke oven]]s.<ref name=Guide/> In 1900, 6,746 people lived in Punxsutawney before the consolidation with Claysville.

The change involved new curriculum topics and teaching practices introduced in the U.S. shortly after the [[Sputnik crisis]], in order to boost science education and mathematical skill in the population so that the technological threat could be met of Soviet engineers, reputedly highly skilled mathematicians. \n\n== Overview ==\nAfter the Sputnik launch in 1957, the U.S. National Science Foundation funded the development of several new curricula in the sciences, such as the [[Physical_Science_Study_Committee|PSSC]] high school physics curriculum, [[Biological_Sciences_Curriculum_Study|BSCS]] in biology, and [https://archive.org/details/CHEMStudy CHEM Study] in chemistry.  Several mathematics curriculum development efforts were also funded as part of the same initiative, such as the [http://library.webster.edu/archives/findingaids/madison/aboutmadisonproject.html Madison Project], [[School_Mathematics_Study_Group|SMSG]], and [https://archive.org/details/highschoolmathemat01univ/page/6/mode/2up UICSM].  These curricula were quite different from one another, but they shared as a starting point the idea that children's learning of arithmetic algorithms would last past the exam only if memorization and practice were paired with teaching for ''understanding.''  More specifically, elementary school arithmetic beyond single digits makes sense only on the basis of understanding place value.  That goal was the reason for teaching arithmetic in bases other than ten in the New Math, despite critics' derision: In that unfamiliar context, students couldn't just mindlessly follow an algorithm, but had to think why the place value of the \"hundreds\" digit in base seven is 49.\n\nTopics introduced in the New Math include [[modular arithmetic]], [[inequality (mathematics)|algebraic inequalities]], [[Radix|bases]] other than [[Base 10|10]], [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], [[Boolean algebra]], and [[abstract algebra]].<ref name = Kline>{{cite book | last = Kline | first = Morris | authorlink = Morris Kline | title = Why Johnny Can't Add: The Failure of the New Math | publisher = [[St. Martin's Press]] | year = 1973 | location = New York | isbn =  0-394-71981-6| title-link = Why Johnny Can't Add: The Failure of the New Math }} </ref> In elementary school, in addition to bases other than 10, students were taught basic [[set theory]] and taught to distinguish \"numerals\" from \"numbers.\" <ref>{{cite web | url =http://web.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/rarm/beberman.html | title =Chapter 1: Max | last =Raimi | first =Ralph | date =May 6, 2004 | access-date =April 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBut the New Math wasn't just a list of topics.  All of the New Math projects emphasized some form of ''discovery learning.''  Students worked in groups to invent theories about problems posed in the textbooks.  Materials for teachers described the classroom as \"noisy.\"  Part of the job of the teacher was to move from table to table assessing the theory that each group of students had developed and \"torpedoing\" wrong theories by providing counterexamples.  For that style of teaching to be tolerable for students, they had to experience the teacher as a colleague rather than as an adversary or as someone concerned mainly with grading.\n\n== Criticisms ==\nParents and teachers who opposed the New Math in the U.S. complained that the new curriculum was too far outside of students' ordinary experience and was not worth taking time away from more traditional topics, such as [[arithmetic]]. The material also put new demands on teachers, many of whom were required to teach material they did not fully understand. Parents were concerned that they did not understand what their children were learning and could not help them with their studies. In an effort to learn the material, many parents attended their children's classes. In the end, it was concluded that the experiment was not working, and New Math fell out of favor before the end of the decade, though it continued to be taught for years thereafter in some school districts.\n\nIn the [[Algebra]] preface of his book ''Precalculus Mathematics in a Nutshell'', Professor [[George F. Simmons]] wrote that the New Math produced students who had \"heard of the [[commutative law]], but did not know the [[multiplication table]].\"<ref>{{cite book|title = Precalculus Mathematics in a Nutshell: Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry: Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry|publisher = [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]|year = 2003|chapter = Algebra &ndash; Introduction|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dN1KAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA33|page = 33|isbn = 9781592441303|authorlink = George F.

In the 'new' mathematics,  then, first there must be freedom of thought; second, we do not want to teach just words; and third, subjects should not be introduced without explaining the purpose or reason, or without giving any way in which the material could be really used to discover something interesting. I don't think it is worthwhile teaching such material.}}\n\nIn his book ''[[Why Johnny Can't Add: the Failure of the New Math]]'', [[Morris Kline]] says that certain advocates of the new topics \"ignored completely the fact that mathematics is a cumulative development and that it is practically impossible to learn the newer creations, if one does not know the older ones.\"<ref name = Kline />{{rp|17}} Furthermore, noting the trend to [[Abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] in New Math, Kline says \"abstraction is not the first stage, but the last stage, in a mathematical development.\"<ref name = Kline />{{rp|98}}\n\nAs a result of this controversy, and despite the ongoing influence of the New Math, the phrase \"new math\" is often used now to describe any short-lived fad that quickly becomes discredited.\n\n== Other countries ==\nIn the broader context, reform of school mathematics curricula was also pursued in European countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] (particularly by the [[School Mathematics Project]]), and [[France]], where the extremely high prestige of mathematical qualifications was not matched by teaching that connected with contemporary research and university topics.{{clarify|date=August 2013}} In [[West Germany]] the changes were seen as part of a larger process of ''[[Education reform|Bildungsreform]]''. Beyond the use of set theory and different approach to [[arithmetic]], characteristic changes were [[transformation geometry]] in place of the [[Natural deduction|traditional deductive]] [[Euclidean geometry]], and an approach to [[calculus]] that was based on greater insight, rather than emphasis on facility.{{clarify|date=February 2011}}{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nAgain, the changes met with a mixed reception, but for different reasons. For example, the end-users of mathematics studies were at that time mostly in the [[physical science]]s and [[engineering]]; and they expected manipulative skill in calculus, rather than more abstract ideas. Some compromises have since been required, given that [[discrete mathematics]] is the basic language of [[computing]].{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nTeaching in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] did not experience such extreme upheavals, while being kept in tune, both with the applications and academic trends: {{quote|\"Under [[Andrey Kolmogorov|A. N. Kolmogorov]], the mathematics committee declared a reform of the curricula of grades 4\u201310, at the time when the school system consisted of 10 grades.

More specifically, elementary school arithmetic beyond single digits is understandable only on the basis of understanding place value.  That goal was the reason for teaching arithmetic in bases other than ten in the New Math, despite critics' derision: In that unfamiliar context, students couldn't just mindlessly follow an algorithm, but had to think why the place value of the \"hundreds\" digit in base seven is 49.\n\nTopics introduced in the New Math include [[modular arithmetic]], [[inequality (mathematics)|algebraic inequalities]], [[Radix|bases]] other than [[Base 10|10]], [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], [[Boolean algebra]], and [[abstract algebra]].<ref name = Kline>{{cite book | last = Kline | first = Morris | authorlink = Morris Kline | title = Why Johnny Can't Add: The Failure of the New Math | publisher = [[St. Martin's Press]] | year = 1973 | location = New York | isbn =  0-394-71981-6| title-link = Why Johnny Can't Add: The Failure of the New Math }} </ref> In elementary school, in addition to bases other than 10, students were taught basic [[set theory]] and taught to distinguish \"numerals\" from \"numbers.\" <ref>{{cite web | url =http://web.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/rarm/beberman.html | title =Chapter 1: Max | last =Raimi | first =Ralph | date =May 6, 2004 | access-date =April 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBut the New Math wasn't just a list of topics.  All of the New Math projects emphasized some form of ''discovery learning.''  Students worked in groups to invent theories about problems posed in the textbooks.  Materials for teachers described the classroom as \"noisy.\"  Part of the job of the teacher was to move from table to table assessing the theory that group of students had developed and \"torpedoing\" wrong theories by providing counterexamples.\n\n== Criticisms ==\nParents and teachers who opposed the New Math in the U.S. complained that the new curriculum was too far outside of students' ordinary experience and was not worth taking time away from more traditional topics, such as [[arithmetic]]. The material also put new demands on teachers, many of whom were required to teach material they did not fully understand. Parents were concerned that they did not understand what their children were learning and could not help them with their studies. In an effort to learn the material, many parents attended their children's classes. In the end, it was concluded that the experiment was not working, and New Math fell out of favor before the end of the decade, though it continued to be taught for years thereafter in some school districts.\n\nIn the [[Algebra]] preface of his book ''Precalculus Mathematics in a Nutshell'', Professor [[George F. Simmons]] wrote that the New Math produced students who had \"heard of the [[commutative law]], but did not know the [[multiplication table]].\"<ref>{{cite book|title = Precalculus Mathematics in a Nutshell: Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry: Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry|publisher = [[Wipf and Stock Publishers]]|year = 2003|chapter = Algebra &ndash; Introduction|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dN1KAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA33|page = 33|isbn = 9781592441303|authorlink = George F.

In the 'new' mathematics,  then, first there must be freedom of thought; second, we do not want to teach just words; and third, subjects should not be introduced without explaining the purpose or reason, or without giving any way in which the material could be really used to discover something interesting. I don't think it is worthwhile teaching such material.}}\n\nIn his book ''[[Why Johnny Can't Add: the Failure of the New Math]]'', [[Morris Kline]] says that certain advocates of the new topics \"ignored completely the fact that mathematics is a cumulative development and that it is practically impossible to learn the newer creations, if one does not know the older ones.\"<ref name = Kline />{{rp|17}} Furthermore, noting the trend to [[Abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] in New Math, Kline says \"abstraction is not the first stage, but the last stage, in a mathematical development.\"<ref name = Kline />{{rp|98}}\n\nAs a result of this controversy, and despite the ongoing influence of the New Math, the phrase \"new math\" is often used now to describe any short-lived fad that quickly becomes discredited.\n\n== Other countries ==\nIn the broader context, reform of school mathematics curricula was also pursued in European countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] (particularly by the [[School Mathematics Project]]), and [[France]], where the extremely high prestige of mathematical qualifications was not matched by teaching that connected with contemporary research and university topics.{{clarify|date=August 2013}} In [[West Germany]] the changes were seen as part of a larger process of ''[[Education reform|Bildungsreform]]''. Beyond the use of set theory and different approach to [[arithmetic]], characteristic changes were [[transformation geometry]] in place of the [[Natural deduction|traditional deductive]] [[Euclidean geometry]], and an approach to [[calculus]] that was based on greater insight, rather than emphasis on facility.{{clarify|date=February 2011}}{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nAgain, the changes met with a mixed reception, but for different reasons. For example, the end-users of mathematics studies were at that time mostly in the [[physical science]]s and [[engineering]]; and they expected manipulative skill in calculus, rather than more abstract ideas. Some compromises have since been required, given that [[discrete mathematics]] is the basic language of [[computing]].{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nTeaching in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] did not experience such extreme upheavals, while being kept in tune, both with the applications and academic trends: {{quote|\"Under [[Andrey Kolmogorov|A. N. Kolmogorov]], the mathematics committee declared a reform of the curricula of grades 4\u201310, at the time when the school system consisted of 10 grades.
