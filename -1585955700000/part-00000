{"title_page": "History of Uganda (1979\u2013present)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2015}}\n{{History of Uganda}}\nThe '''history of Uganda since 11 April 1979''' comprises the [[history of Uganda]] since the end of the [[Uganda under Idi Amin|dictatorship]] of [[Idi Amin]]. This period has seen the second rule of [[Milton Obote]] and the presidency of [[Yoweri Museveni]] since 1986, in which Ugandan politics have been dominated by the [[National Resistance Movement]].\n\n==Uganda after Amin (1979\u20131986)==\n\n===Interim period===\n\nA month before the capture of [[Kampala]] during the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]], representatives of twenty-two Ugandan civilian and military groups were hastily called together at Moshi, Tanzania, to try to agree on an interim civilian government once Amin was removed. Called the Unity Conference in the hope that unity might prevail, it managed to establish the [[Uganda National Liberation Front]] (UNLF) as political representative of the UNLA. [[Yusuf Lule]], former principal of [[Makerere University]], became head of the UNLF executive committee. \n\nAs an academic rather than a politician, Lule was not regarded as a threat to any of the contending factions. Shortly after Amin's departure, Lule and the UNLF moved to Kampala, where they established an interim government. Lule became president, advised by a temporary parliament, the [[National Consultative Council]] (NCC). The NCC, in turn, was composed of representatives from the Unity Conference.\n\nConflict surfaced immediately between Lule and some of the more radical of the council members who saw him as too conservative, too autocratic, and too willing as a [[Muganda]] to listen to advice from other [[Baganda]]. After only three months, with the apparent approval of [[Julius Nyerere]], whose troops still controlled Kampala, Lule was forcibly removed from office and exiled. He was replaced by [[Godfrey Binaisa]], a Muganda like Lule, but one who had previously served as a high-ranking member of [[Milton Obote]]'s UPC. \n\nIt was not an auspicious start to the rebuilding of a new Uganda, which required political and economic stability. Indeed, the quarrels within the NCC, which Binaisa enlarged to 127 members, revealed that many rival and would-be politicians who had returned from exile were resuming their self-interested operating styles. Ugandans who endured the deprivations of the Amin era became even more disillusioned with their leaders. Binaisa managed to stay in office longer than Lule, but his inability to gain control over a burgeoning new military presence proved to be his downfall.\n\nThe [[Military of Uganda|armed forces]] numbered fewer than 1,000 troops who had fought alongside the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) to expel Amin. The army had shrunk to the size of the original [[King's African Rifles]] at independence in 1962. But in 1979, in an attempt to consolidate support for the future, leaders such as [[Yoweri Kaguta Museveni]] and Major General (later Chief of Staff) [[David Oyite Ojok]] began to enrol thousands of recruits grew to 8,000; Ojok's original 600 became 24,000. When Binaisa sought to curb the use of these militias, which were harassing and detaining political opponents, he was overthrown in a military coup on 10 May 1980. \n\nThe coup was engineered by Ojok, Museveni, and others acting under the general direction of [[Paulo Muwanga]], Obote's right-hand man and chair of the [[Military Commission]]. The TPDF was still providing necessary security while Uganda's police force, which had been all but destroyed by Amin, was rebuilt, but Nyerere refused to help Binaisa retain power. Many Ugandans claimed that although Nyerere did not impose his own choice on Uganda, he indirectly facilitated the return to power of his old friend and ally, [[Milton Obote]]. In any case, the Military Commission headed by Muwanga effectively governed Uganda during the six months leading up to the national elections of December 1980.\n\nFurther evidence of the militarization of Ugandan politics was provided by the proposed expenditures of the newly empowered Military Commission. Security and defense were to be allotted more than 30 percent of the national revenues. For a country desperately seeking funds for economic recovery from the excesses of the previous military regime, this allocation seemed unreasonable to civilian leaders.\n\nShortly after Muwanga's 1980 coup, Obote made a triumphant return from Tanzania. In the months before the December elections, he began to rally his former UPC supporters. Ominously, in view of recent Ugandan history, he often appeared on the platform with General [[Oyite-Ojok]], a fellow [[Langi people|Lango]]. Obote also began to speak of the need to return to a UPC one-party state.\n\nThe national election on 10 December 1980 was a crucial turning point for Uganda. It was, after all, the first election in eighteen years. Several parties contested, the most important of which were Obote's UPC and the DP led by [[Paul Kawanga Ssemogerere]]. Most of Uganda's Roman Catholics were DP members, along with many others whose main concern was to prevent the return of another Obote regime. Because the Military Commission, as the acting government, was dominated by Obote supporters (notably chairman [[Paulo Muwanga]]), the DP and other contenders faced formidable obstacles. By election day, the UPC had achieved some exceptional advantages, summarized by Minority Rights Group Report Number 66 as follows: Seventeen UPC candidates were declared \"unopposed\" by the simple procedure of not allowing DP or other candidates to run against them. \n\nFourteen district commissioners, who were expected to supervise local polling, were replaced with UPC nominees. The chief justice of Uganda, to whom complaints of election irregularities would have to be made, was replaced with a UPC member. In a number of districts, non-UPC candidates were arrested, and one was murdered. Even before the election, the government press and Radio Uganda appeared to treat the UPC as the victor. Muwanga insisted that each party have a separate ballot box on election day, thus negating the right of secret ballot. There were a number of other moves to aid the UPC, including Muwanga's statement that the future parliament would also contain an unspecified number of unelected representatives of the army and other interest groups.\n\nPolling appeared to be heavy on election day, and by the end of the voting, the DP, on the basis of its own estimates, declared victory in 81 of 126 constituencies. The British Broadcasting Corporation and Voice of America broadcast the news of the DP triumph, and Kampala's streets were filled with DP celebrants. At this point, Muwanga seized control of the Electoral Commission, along with the power to count the ballots, and declared that anyone disputing his count would be subject to a heavy fine and five years in jail. Eighteen hours later, Muwanga announced a UPC victory, with 72 seats. Some DP candidates claimed the ballot boxes were simply switched to give their own vote tally to the UPC runner-up. \n\nNevertheless, a small contingent of neutral election watchers, the [[Commonwealth Observer Group]], declared itself satisfied with the validity of the election. Some Ugandans criticized the Commonwealth Observer Group, suggesting that members of the group measured African elections by different standards than those used elsewhere or that they feared civil war if the results were questioned. Indeed, popular perception of a stolen election actually helped bring about the civil war the Commonwealth Observer Group may have feared.\n\n===Second Obote period (1981\u20131985)===\n{{See also|Ugandan Bush War}}\n\nIn February 1981, shortly after the new Obote government took office, with [[Paulo Muwanga]] as vice president and minister of defense, a former Military Commission member, [[Yoweri Museveni]], and his armed supporters declared themselves the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA). Museveni vowed to overthrow Obote by means of a popular rebellion, and what became known as \"the war in the bush\" began. Several other underground groups also emerged to attempt to sabotage the new regime, but they were eventually crushed. Museveni, who had guerilla war experience with the [[Front for the Liberation of Mozambique]] (Frente de Liberta\u00e7\u00e2o de Mo\u00e7ambique\u2014Frelimo), campaigned in rural areas hostile to Obote's government, especially central and western [[Buganda]] and the western regions of [[Ankole]] and [[Bunyoro]].\n\nThe Obote government's four-year military effort to destroy its challengers resulted in vast areas of devastation and greater loss of life than during the eight years of Amin's rule. UNLA's many [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Langi people|Lango]] had been hastily enrolled with minimal training and little sense of discipline. Although they were survivors of Amin's genocidal purges of north-east Uganda, in the 1980s they were armed and in uniform, conducting similar actions against Bantu-speaking Ugandans in the south, with whom they appeared to feel no empathy or even pity. \n\nIn early 1983, to eliminate rural support for Museveni's guerrillas the area of [[Luwero]] District, north of Kampala, was targeted for a massive population removal affecting almost 750,000 people. These artificially created refugees were packed into several internment camps subject to military control, which in reality meant military abuse. Civilians outside the camps, in what came to be known as the \"Luwero Triangle,\" were presumed to be guerrillas or guerilla sympathizers and were treated accordingly. The farms of this highly productive agricultural area were looted\u2014roofs, doors, and even door frames were stolen by UNLA troops. Civilian loss of life was extensive, as evidenced some years later by piles of human skulls in bush clearings and alongside rural roads.\n\nThe army also concentrated on the north-western corner of Uganda, in what was then West Nile District. Bordering Sudan, West Nile had provided the ethnic base for much of Idi Amin's earlier support and had enjoyed relative prosperity under his rule. Having borne the brunt of Amin's anti-Acholi massacres in previous years, Acholi soldiers avenged themselves on inhabitants of Amin's home region, whom they blamed for their losses. In one famous incident in June 1981, Ugandan Army soldiers attacked a Catholic mission where local refugees had sought sanctuary. When the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) reported a subsequent massacre, the government expelled it from Uganda.\n\nDespite these activities, Obote's government, unlike Amin's regime, was sensitive to its international image and realized the importance of securing foreign aid for the nation's economic recovery. Obote had sought and followed the advice of the [[International Monetary Fund]], even though the austerity measures ran counter to his own ideology. He devalued the Uganda shilling by 100 percent, attempted to facilitate the export of cash crops, and postponed any plans he may once have entertained for re-establishing one-party rule. The continued sufferance of the DP, although much harried and abused by UPC stalwarts, became an important symbol to international donors. The government's inability to eliminate Museveni and win the civil war, however, sapped its economic strength, and the occupation of a large part of the country by an army hostile to the Ugandans living there furthered discontent with the regime. \n\nAbductions by the police, as well as the detentions and disappearances so characteristic of the Amin period, recurred. In place of torture at the infamous [[State Research Bureau (organisation)|State Research Bureau]] at [[Nakasero]], victims met the same fate at so-called \"Nile Mansions.\" [[Amnesty International]], a human rights organization, issued a chilling report of routine torture of civilian detainees at military barracks scattered across southern Uganda. The overall death toll from 1981 to 1985 was estimated as high as 500,000. Obote, once seen by the donor community as the one man with the experience and will to restore Uganda's fortunes, now appeared to be a liability to recovery.\n\nIn this deteriorating military and economic situation, Obote subordinated other matters to a military victory over Museveni. [[North Korea]]n military advisers were invited to take part against the NRA rebels in what was to be a final campaign that won neither British nor United States approval. But the army was warweary, and after the death of the highly capable General [[Oyite Ojok]] in a helicopter accident at the end of 1983, it began to split along ethnic lines. Acholi soldiers complained that they were given too much front-line action and too few rewards for their services. \n\nObote delayed appointing a successor to Oyite Ojok for as long as possible. In the end, he appointed a Lango to the post and attempted to counter the objection of Acholi officers by spying on them, reviving his old paramilitary counterweight, the mostly Langi Special Force Units, and thus repeating some of the actions that led to his overthrow by Amin. As if determined to replay the January 1971 events, Obote once again left the capital after giving orders for the arrest of a leading Acholi commander, Brigadier (later Lieutenant General) [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]], who mobilized troops and entered Kampala on 27 July 1985. Obote, together with a large entourage, fled the country for Zambia. This time, unlike the last, Obote allegedly took much of the national treasury with him.\n\n===Return of military rule (1985\u20131986)===\nThe military government of General [[Tito Okello]] ruled from July 1985 to January 1986 with no explicit policy except the natural goal of self-preservation\u2014the motive for their defensive coup. To stiffen the flagging efforts of his army against the NRA, Okello invited former soldiers of Amin's army to re-enter Uganda from the Sudanese refugee camps and participate in the civil war on the government side. As mercenaries fresh to the scene, these units fought well, but they were equally interested in looting and did not discriminate between supporters and enemies of the government. The reintroduction of Amin's infamous cohorts was poor international public relations for the Okello government and helped create a new tolerance of Museveni and the NRM/A.\n\nOkello could hardly expect to govern the entire country with only war-weary and disillusioned [[Acholi people|Acholi]] troops to back him. From August to December 1985, the Okello government attempted to negotiate a peace deal with Museveni, the [[Nairobi Agreement, 1985|Nairobi Agreement]]. The resulting ceasefire broke down almost immediately. With Okello and the remnants of the UNLA army thoroughly discouraged, Museveni had only to wait for the regime to disintegrate. \n\nIn January 1986, welcomed enthusiastically by the local civilian population, Museveni moved against Kampala. Okello and his soldiers fled northward to their ethnic base in [[Acholiland]]. [[Yoweri Museveni]] formally claimed the presidency on 29 January 1986. Immense problems of reconstruction awaited the new regime.\n\n==1986 to present ==\nA referendum was held in March 2000 on whether Uganda should retain the Movement system or adopt multi-party politics. Although 70% of voters endorsed retention of the Movement system, the referendum was widely criticized for low voter turnout and unfair restrictions on Movement opponents. Museveni was reelected to a second five-year term in March 2001. Parliamentary elections were held in June 2001, and more than 50% of contested seats were won by newcomers. Movement supporters nevertheless remained in firm control of the legislative branch. Observers believed that the 2001 presidential and parliamentary elections generally reflected the will of the electorate; however, both were marred by serious irregularities, particularly in the period leading up to the elections, such as restrictions on political party activities, incidents of violence, voter intimidation, and fraud. \n\nIn 2001 the [[Constitutional Review Commission]] (CRC) began soliciting opinions and holding public hearings on amending the 1995 Constitution. The CRC was set up to examine the constitutional provisions relating to sovereignty, political systems, democracy and good governance. Its report, scheduled for release by October 2003, has not yet been delivered to Cabinet or made public. The Cabinet, however, presented a list of its suggestions for constitutional change to the CRC in September. These changes included the introduction of a full multiparty system, an increase in executive authority vis-\u00e0-vis the other branches, and the lifting of presidential term limits. The elimination of term limits would clear the way for Museveni to run again in 2006, and there are increasing signs that he wishes to do so. However, this proposal has also produced significant controversy and it is not yet clear when or how the constitution will be changed. \n\nThe rebel group named the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA) continues to harass government forces and murder and kidnap civilians in the north and east. Although the LRA does not threaten the stability of the government, LRA violence has displaced 1.2 million people and created a humanitarian crisis. At least 20,000 children have also been abducted over the years. The [[Uganda Peoples Defense Force]] (UPDF) launched \"Operation Iron Fist\" against LRA rebels in northern Uganda in 2002 and conducted operations against LRA sanctuaries in southern Sudan with the permission of the Sudanese Government. Uganda and Sudan have resumed diplomatic relations and exchanged Ambassadors; however, Uganda continues to{{when}} accuse Sudan of supporting the LRA. Sudan denies the allegations.\n\nIn 1998, Uganda deployed a sizable military force to eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), ostensibly to prevent attacks from Ugandan rebel groups operating there. There were widespread allegations that Ugandan military and civilian officials were involved in the illegal exploitation of DRC natural resources. After much international pressure, Uganda withdrew its troops from DRC in June 2003.\n\nOn 14 November 2004 it was reported that the President had declared a week-long truce with the rebels that was to begin the following day.\n\nIn August 2005, Parliament voted to change the constitution to lift presidential term limits, allowing Museveni to run for a third term. In a [[Uganda multiparty referendum, 2005|referendum in July 2005]], 92.5% supported restoring multiparty politics, thereby scrapping the no-party or \"movement system\". \n\nIn October 2005 [[Kizza Besigye]], Museveni's main political rival, returned from exile. The same month, another of Museveni's rivals, Milton Obote, died in South Africa, and was given a state funeral in Kampala.\n\nThe [[Ugandan general election, 2006|February 2006 elections]], the first multiparty elections in 25 years, were held with Besigye's [[Forum for Democratic Change]] (FDC) as the main challenger to Museveni's [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM). NRM won most seats in the [[National Assembly of Uganda|National Assembly]], and Museveni won the presidency.\n\nOn 20 August 2007, Uganda declared that it is seeking legal advice on establishing a [[war crime]]s court.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6954860.stm |title=Uganda considers war crimes court |accessdate=20 August 2007 |format= |work=BBC News | date=20 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 October 2011, US President Obama authorized the deployment to Uganda of approximately 100 combat-equipped US forces to help regional forces \"remove from the battlefield\" \u2013 meaning capture or kill \u2013 Lord\u2019s Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony and senior leaders of the LRA.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tapper|first=Jake|title=Obama Sends 100 US Troops to Uganda to Help Combat Lord\u2019s Resistance Army|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/10/obama-sends-100-us-troops-to-uganda-to-combat-lords-resistance-army/|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2016, Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] described the formation of an [[East African Federation]] uniting Uganda, [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], and [[South Sudan]] as \"the number one target that we should aim at.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/ugandas-museveni-wants-create-east-african-superstate-424975?rm=eu|title=Ahead of election, Museveni says he wants to build East African superstate #UgandaDecides|newspaper=Newsweek|access-date=2016-10-22}}</ref> In September 2018 a committee was formed to begin the process of drafting a regional constitution,<ref name=\"theeastafrican.co.ke\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/Dream-of-a-United-States-of-East-Africa/4552908-4783896-glbl64/index.html|title=Ready for a United States of East Africa?|publisher=}}</ref> and a draft constitution for a confederation is set to be written by 2021, with implementation of the confederacy by 2023.<ref name=\"East African 2\">{{cite web |last=Havyarimana |first=Moses |url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/East-africa-experts-draft-confederation-constitution/4552908-5422610-11fx1ge/index.html |title=Regional experts draft confederation constitution |work=[[The EastAfrican]] |date=18 January 2020 |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References and notes==\n*{{loc}} \u2013 [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html Uganda]\n*U.S. State Department [https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2963.htm#history Background Note: Uganda]\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/photo_gallery/3514439.stm In Pictures: Uganda Massacre, at BBC]\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2982818.stm \"Uganda's atrocious war\" at the BBC ]\n*[http://www.alertnet.org/db/crisisprofiles/UG_VIO.htm?v=in_detail Crisis briefing on Uganda's two decades of violence] from [[Reuters AlertNet]]\n\n{{Years in Uganda}}\n{{Uganda topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Uganda (1979-Present)}}\n[[Category:History of Uganda by period]]\n[[Category:Contemporary history by country|Uganda]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2015}}\n{{History of Uganda}}\nThe '''history of Uganda since 11 April 1979''' comprises the [[history of Uganda]] since the end of the [[Uganda under Idi Amin|dictatorship]] of [[Idi Amin]].

He was replaced by [[Godfrey Binaisa]], a Muganda like Lule, but one who had previously served as a high-ranking member of [[Milton Obote]]'s UPC. \n\nIt was not an auspicious start to the rebuilding of a new Uganda, which required political and economic stability. Indeed, the quarrels within the NCC, which Binaisa enlarged to 127 members, revealed that many rival and would-be politicians who had returned from exile were resuming their self-interested operating styles. Ugandans who endured the deprivations of the Amin era became even more disillusioned with their leaders. Binaisa managed to stay in office longer than Lule, but his inability to gain control over a burgeoning new military presence proved to be his downfall.\n\nThe [[Military of Uganda|armed forces]] numbered fewer than 1,000 troops who had fought alongside the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) to expel Amin. The army had shrunk to the size of the original [[King's African Rifles]] at independence in 1962. But in 1979, in an attempt to consolidate support for the future, leaders such as [[Yoweri Kaguta Museveni]] and Major General (later Chief of Staff) [[David Oyite Ojok]] began to enrol thousands of recruits grew to 8,000; Ojok's original 600 became 24,000. When Binaisa sought to curb the use of these militias, which were harassing and detaining political opponents, he was overthrown in a military coup on 10 May 1980. \n\nThe coup was engineered by Ojok, Museveni, and others acting under the general direction of [[Paulo Muwanga]], Obote's right-hand man and chair of the [[Military Commission]]. The TPDF was still providing necessary security while Uganda's police force, which had been all but destroyed by Amin, was rebuilt, but Nyerere refused to help Binaisa retain power. Many Ugandans claimed that although Nyerere did not impose his own choice on Uganda, he indirectly facilitated the return to power of his old friend and ally, [[Milton Obote]]. In any case, the Military Commission headed by Muwanga effectively governed Uganda during the six months leading up to the national elections of December 1980.\n\nFurther evidence of the militarization of Ugandan politics was provided by the proposed expenditures of the newly empowered Military Commission. Security and defense were to be allotted more than 30 percent of the national revenues. For a country desperately seeking funds for economic recovery from the excesses of the previous military regime, this allocation seemed unreasonable to civilian leaders.\n\nShortly after Muwanga's 1980 coup, Obote made a triumphant return from Tanzania. In the months before the December elections, he began to rally his former UPC supporters. Ominously, in view of recent Ugandan history, he often appeared on the platform with General [[Oyite-Ojok]], a fellow [[Langi people|Lango]]. Obote also began to speak of the need to return to a UPC one-party state.\n\nThe national election on 10 December 1980 was a crucial turning point for Uganda. It was, after all, the first election in eighteen years. Several parties contested, the most important of which were Obote's UPC and the DP led by [[Paul Kawanga Ssemogerere]]. Most of Uganda's Roman Catholics were DP members, along with many others whose main concern was to prevent the return of another Obote regime. Because the Military Commission, as the acting government, was dominated by Obote supporters (notably chairman [[Paulo Muwanga]]), the DP and other contenders faced formidable obstacles. By election day, the UPC had achieved some exceptional advantages, summarized by Minority Rights Group Report Number 66 as follows: Seventeen UPC candidates were declared \"unopposed\" by the simple procedure of not allowing DP or other candidates to run against them. \n\nFourteen district commissioners, who were expected to supervise local polling, were replaced with UPC nominees. The chief justice of Uganda, to whom complaints of election irregularities would have to be made, was replaced with a UPC member. In a number of districts, non-UPC candidates were arrested, and one was murdered. Even before the election, the government press and Radio Uganda appeared to treat the UPC as the victor. Muwanga insisted that each party have a separate ballot box on election day, thus negating the right of secret ballot. There were a number of other moves to aid the UPC, including Muwanga's statement that the future parliament would also contain an unspecified number of unelected representatives of the army and other interest groups.\n\nPolling appeared to be heavy on election day, and by the end of the voting, the DP, on the basis of its own estimates, declared victory in 81 of 126 constituencies. The British Broadcasting Corporation and Voice of America broadcast the news of the DP triumph, and Kampala's streets were filled with DP celebrants. At this point, Muwanga seized control of the Electoral Commission, along with the power to count the ballots, and declared that anyone disputing his count would be subject to a heavy fine and five years in jail. Eighteen hours later, Muwanga announced a UPC victory, with 72 seats. Some DP candidates claimed the ballot boxes were simply switched to give their own vote tally to the UPC runner-up. \n\nNevertheless, a small contingent of neutral election watchers, the [[Commonwealth Observer Group]], declared itself satisfied with the validity of the election. Some Ugandans criticized the Commonwealth Observer Group, suggesting that members of the group measured African elections by different standards than those used elsewhere or that they feared civil war if the results were questioned. Indeed, popular perception of a stolen election actually helped bring about the civil war the Commonwealth Observer Group may have feared.\n\n===Second Obote period (1981\u20131985)===\n{{See also|Ugandan Bush War}}\n\nIn February 1981, shortly after the new Obote government took office, with [[Paulo Muwanga]] as vice president and minister of defense, a former Military Commission member, [[Yoweri Museveni]], and his armed supporters declared themselves the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA). Museveni vowed to overthrow Obote by means of a popular rebellion, and what became known as \"the war in the bush\" began. Several other underground groups also emerged to attempt to sabotage the new regime, but they were eventually crushed. Museveni, who had guerilla war experience with the [[Front for the Liberation of Mozambique]] (Frente de Liberta\u00e7\u00e2o de Mo\u00e7ambique\u2014Frelimo), campaigned in rural areas hostile to Obote's government, especially central and western [[Buganda]] and the western regions of [[Ankole]] and [[Bunyoro]].\n\nThe Obote government's four-year military effort to destroy its challengers resulted in vast areas of devastation and greater loss of life than during the eight years of Amin's rule. UNLA's many [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Langi people|Lango]] had been hastily enrolled with minimal training and little sense of discipline. Although they were survivors of Amin's genocidal purges of north-east Uganda, in the 1980s they were armed and in uniform, conducting similar actions against Bantu-speaking Ugandans in the south, with whom they appeared to feel no empathy or even pity. \n\nIn early 1983, to eliminate rural support for Museveni's guerrillas the area of [[Luwero]] District, north of Kampala, was targeted for a massive population removal affecting almost 750,000 people. These artificially created refugees were packed into several internment camps subject to military control, which in reality meant military abuse. Civilians outside the camps, in what came to be known as the \"Luwero Triangle,\" were presumed to be guerrillas or guerilla sympathizers and were treated accordingly. The farms of this highly productive agricultural area were looted\u2014roofs, doors, and even door frames were stolen by UNLA troops. Civilian loss of life was extensive, as evidenced some years later by piles of human skulls in bush clearings and alongside rural roads.\n\nThe army also concentrated on the north-western corner of Uganda, in what was then West Nile District. Bordering Sudan, West Nile had provided the ethnic base for much of Idi Amin's earlier support and had enjoyed relative prosperity under his rule. Having borne the brunt of Amin's anti-Acholi massacres in previous years, Acholi soldiers avenged themselves on inhabitants of Amin's home region, whom they blamed for their losses. In one famous incident in June 1981, Ugandan Army soldiers attacked a Catholic mission where local refugees had sought sanctuary. When the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) reported a subsequent massacre, the government expelled it from Uganda.\n\nDespite these activities, Obote's government, unlike Amin's regime, was sensitive to its international image and realized the importance of securing foreign aid for the nation's economic recovery. Obote had sought and followed the advice of the [[International Monetary Fund]], even though the austerity measures ran counter to his own ideology. He devalued the Uganda shilling by 100 percent, attempted to facilitate the export of cash crops, and postponed any plans he may once have entertained for re-establishing one-party rule. The continued sufferance of the DP, although much harried and abused by UPC stalwarts, became an important symbol to international donors. The government's inability to eliminate Museveni and win the civil war, however, sapped its economic strength, and the occupation of a large part of the country by an army hostile to the Ugandans living there furthered discontent with the regime. \n\nAbductions by the police, as well as the detentions and disappearances so characteristic of the Amin period, recurred. In place of torture at the infamous [[State Research Bureau (organisation)|State Research Bureau]] at [[Nakasero]], victims met the same fate at so-called \"Nile Mansions.\" [[Amnesty International]], a human rights organization, issued a chilling report of routine torture of civilian detainees at military barracks scattered across southern Uganda. The overall death toll from 1981 to 1985 was estimated as high as 500,000. Obote, once seen by the donor community as the one man with the experience and will to restore Uganda's fortunes, now appeared to be a liability to recovery.\n\nIn this deteriorating military and economic situation, Obote subordinated other matters to a military victory over Museveni. [[North Korea]]n military advisers were invited to take part against the NRA rebels in what was to be a final campaign that won neither British nor United States approval. But the army was warweary, and after the death of the highly capable General [[Oyite Ojok]] in a helicopter accident at the end of 1983, it began to split along ethnic lines. Acholi soldiers complained that they were given too much front-line action and too few rewards for their services. \n\nObote delayed appointing a successor to Oyite Ojok for as long as possible. In the end, he appointed a Lango to the post and attempted to counter the objection of Acholi officers by spying on them, reviving his old paramilitary counterweight, the mostly Langi Special Force Units, and thus repeating some of the actions that led to his overthrow by Amin. As if determined to replay the January 1971 events, Obote once again left the capital after giving orders for the arrest of a leading Acholi commander, Brigadier (later Lieutenant General) [[Bazilio Olara-Okello]], who mobilized troops and entered Kampala on 27 July 1985. Obote, together with a large entourage, fled the country for Zambia. This time, unlike the last, Obote allegedly took much of the national treasury with him.\n\n===Return of military rule (1985\u20131986)===\nThe military government of General [[Tito Okello]] ruled from July 1985 to January 1986 with no explicit policy except the natural goal of self-preservation\u2014the motive for their defensive coup. To stiffen the flagging efforts of his army against the NRA, Okello invited former soldiers of Amin's army to re-enter Uganda from the Sudanese refugee camps and participate in the civil war on the government side. As mercenaries fresh to the scene, these units fought well, but they were equally interested in looting and did not discriminate between supporters and enemies of the government. The reintroduction of Amin's infamous cohorts was poor international public relations for the Okello government and helped create a new tolerance of Museveni and the NRM/A.\n\nOkello could hardly expect to govern the entire country with only war-weary and disillusioned [[Acholi people|Acholi]] troops to back him. From August to December 1985, the Okello government attempted to negotiate a peace deal with Museveni, the [[Nairobi Agreement, 1985|Nairobi Agreement]]. The resulting ceasefire broke down almost immediately. With Okello and the remnants of the UNLA army thoroughly discouraged, Museveni had only to wait for the regime to disintegrate. \n\nIn January 1986, welcomed enthusiastically by the local civilian population, Museveni moved against Kampala. Okello and his soldiers fled northward to their ethnic base in [[Acholiland]]. [[Yoweri Museveni]] formally claimed the presidency on 29 January 1986. Immense problems of reconstruction awaited the new regime.\n\n==1986 to present ==\nA referendum was held in March 2000 on whether Uganda should retain the Movement system or adopt multi-party politics. Although 70% of voters endorsed retention of the Movement system, the referendum was widely criticized for low voter turnout and unfair restrictions on Movement opponents. Museveni was reelected to a second five-year term in March 2001. Parliamentary elections were held in June 2001, and more than 50% of contested seats were won by newcomers. Movement supporters nevertheless remained in firm control of the legislative branch. Observers believed that the 2001 presidential and parliamentary elections generally reflected the will of the electorate; however, both were marred by serious irregularities, particularly in the period leading up to the elections, such as restrictions on political party activities, incidents of violence, voter intimidation, and fraud. \n\nIn 2001 the [[Constitutional Review Commission]] (CRC) began soliciting opinions and holding public hearings on amending the 1995 Constitution. The CRC was set up to examine the constitutional provisions relating to sovereignty, political systems, democracy and good governance. Its report, scheduled for release by October 2003, has not yet been delivered to Cabinet or made public. The Cabinet, however, presented a list of its suggestions for constitutional change to the CRC in September. These changes included the introduction of a full multiparty system, an increase in executive authority vis-\u00e0-vis the other branches, and the lifting of presidential term limits. The elimination of term limits would clear the way for Museveni to run again in 2006, and there are increasing signs that he wishes to do so. However, this proposal has also produced significant controversy and it is not yet clear when or how the constitution will be changed. \n\nThe rebel group named the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA) continues to harass government forces and murder and kidnap civilians in the north and east. Although the LRA does not threaten the stability of the government, LRA violence has displaced 1.2 million people and created a humanitarian crisis. At least 20,000 children have also been abducted over the years. The [[Uganda Peoples Defense Force]] (UPDF) launched \"Operation Iron Fist\" against LRA rebels in northern Uganda in 2002 and conducted operations against LRA sanctuaries in southern Sudan with the permission of the Sudanese Government. Uganda and Sudan have resumed diplomatic relations and exchanged Ambassadors; however, Uganda continues to accuse Sudan of supporting the LRA. Sudan denies the allegations.\n\nIn 1998, Uganda deployed a sizable military force to eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), ostensibly to prevent attacks from Ugandan rebel groups operating there. There were widespread allegations that Ugandan military and civilian officials were involved in the illegal exploitation of DRC natural resources. After much international pressure, Uganda withdrew its troops from DRC in June 2003.\n\nOn 14 November 2004 it was reported that the President had declared a week-long truce with the rebels that was to begin the following day.\n\nIn August 2005, Parliament voted to change the constitution to lift presidential term limits, allowing Museveni to run for a third term. In a [[Uganda multiparty referendum, 2005|referendum in July 2005]], 92.5% supported restoring multiparty politics, thereby scrapping the no-party or \"movement system\". \n\nIn October 2005 [[Kizza Besigye]], Museveni's main political rival, returned from exile. The same month, another of Museveni's rivals, Milton Obote, died in South Africa, and was given a state funeral in Kampala.\n\nThe [[Ugandan general election, 2006|February 2006 elections]], the first multiparty elections in 25 years, were held with Besigye's [[Forum for Democratic Change]] (FDC) as the main challenger to Museveni's [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM). NRM won most seats in the [[National Assembly of Uganda|National Assembly]], and Museveni won the presidency.\n\nOn 20 August 2007, Uganda declared that it is seeking legal advice on establishing a [[war crime]]s court.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6954860.stm |title=Uganda considers war crimes court |accessdate=20 August 2007 |format= |work=BBC News | date=20 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 October 2011, US President Obama authorized the deployment to Uganda of approximately 100 combat-equipped US forces to help regional forces \"remove from the battlefield\" \u2013 meaning capture or kill \u2013 Lord\u2019s Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony and senior leaders of the LRA.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tapper|first=Jake|title=Obama Sends 100 US Troops to Uganda to Help Combat Lord\u2019s Resistance Army|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/10/obama-sends-100-us-troops-to-uganda-to-combat-lords-resistance-army/|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2016, Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] described the formation of an [[East African Federation]] uniting Uganda, [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], and [[South Sudan]] as \"the number one target that we should aim at.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/ugandas-museveni-wants-create-east-african-superstate-424975?rm=eu|title=Ahead of election, Museveni says he wants to build East African superstate #UgandaDecides|newspaper=Newsweek|access-date=2016-10-22}}</ref> In September 2018 a committee was formed to begin the process of drafting a regional constitution,<ref name=\"theeastafrican.co.ke\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/Dream-of-a-United-States-of-East-Africa/4552908-4783896-glbl64/index.html|title=Ready for a United States of East Africa?|publisher=}}</ref> and a draft constitution for a confederation is set to be written by 2021, with implementation of the confederacy by 2023.<ref name=\"East African 2\">{{cite web |last=Havyarimana |first=Moses |url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/ea/East-africa-experts-draft-confederation-constitution/4552908-5422610-11fx1ge/index.html |title=Regional experts draft confederation constitution |work=[[The EastAfrican]] |date=18 January 2020 |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References and notes==\n*{{loc}} \u2013 [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html Uganda]\n*U.S. State Department [https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2963.htm#history Background Note: Uganda]\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/photo_gallery/3514439.stm In Pictures: Uganda Massacre, at BBC]\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2982818.stm \"Uganda's atrocious war\" at the BBC ]\n*[http://www.alertnet.org/db/crisisprofiles/UG_VIO.htm?v=in_detail Crisis briefing on Uganda's two decades of violence] from [[Reuters AlertNet]]\n\n{{Years in Uganda}}\n{{Uganda topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Uganda (1979-Present)}}\n[[Category:History of Uganda by period]]\n[[Category:Contemporary history by country|Uganda]]\n", "name_user": "Gazelle55", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e1986 to present:Tag for material that may be out of date", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Uganda_(1979%E2%80%93present)"}

Some televangelists are also regular [[pastor]]s or ministers in their own places of worship (often a [[megachurch]]), but the majority of their followers come from TV and radio audiences. Others do not have a conventional congregation, and work primarily through television. The term is also used derisively by critics as an insinuation of aggrandizement by such ministers.\n\nTelevangelism began as a uniquely American phenomenon, resulting from a [[Television in the United States|largely deregulated media]] where access to [[television network]]s and [[cable TV]] is open to virtually anyone who can afford it, combined with a [[Christianity in the United States|large Christian population]] that is able to provide the necessary funding. It became especially popular among [[Evangelical Protestant]] audiences, whether independent or organized around Christian denominations. However, the increasing globalisation of broadcasting has enabled some American televangelists to reach a wider audience through international broadcast networks, including some that are specifically Christian in nature, such as [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] and [[The God Channel]]. Domestically produced televangelism is increasingly present in some other nations such as [[Brazil]].\n\nSome countries have a more regulated media with either general restrictions on access or specific rules regarding religious broadcasting. In such countries, religious programming is typically produced by TV companies (sometimes as a regulatory or public service requirement) rather than private [[interest group]]s.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe word ''televangelism'' is a [[portmanteau]] of [[television]] and [[evangelism]] and it was coined in 1958 as the title of a television miniseries by the [[Southern Baptist Convention]].<ref name=Stewart>{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Tim|title=televangelism|url=http://www.dictionaryofchristianese.com/televangelism/|website=Dictionary of Christianese|accessdate=March 25, 2016|date=January 13, 2015}}</ref> [[Jeffrey K.

Addison-Wesley, 1981. {{ISBN|978-0201038859}}.</ref> However, the term ''televangelist'' was employed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine already in 1952, when telegenic Roman Catholic Bishop [[Fulton Sheen]] was referred to as the \"first televangelist\".<ref>\"Bishop Fulton Sheen: The First 'Televangelist'\", ''Time Magazine'', Monday, April 14, 1952</ref>\n\n==National Religious Broadcasters==\nAn association of American [[Evangelical Protestant]] religious broadcasters, the [[National Religious Broadcasters]], was founded in 1944.\n\n== History ==\n===Radio (1920s-onwards)===\n[[Image:S Parkes Cadman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[S. Parkes Cadman]], one of the first ministers to use radio, beginning in 1923]]\nChristianity has always emphasized [[Good News (Christianity)|preaching the gospel]] to the whole world, taking as inspiration the [[Great Commission]]. Historically, this was achieved by sending [[Christian missionaries|missionaries]], beginning with the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]], and later, after the invention of the [[printing press]], included the distribution of [[Bibles]] and [[religious tracts]]. Some Christians realized that the rapid uptake of [[radio]] beginning in the 1920s provided a powerful new tool for this task, and they were amongst the first producers of [[radio programming]]. Radio broadcasts were seen as a complementary activity to traditional missionaries, enabling vast numbers to be reached at relatively low cost, but also enabling Christianity to be preached in countries where this was illegal and missionaries were banned. The aim of Christian radio was to both convert people to Christianity and to provide teaching and support to believers. These activities continue today, particularly in the developing world. [[Shortwave]] radio stations with a Christian format broadcast worldwide, such as [[HCJB]] in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], [[Family Radio]]'s [[WYFR]], and the [[Bible Broadcasting Network|Bible Broadcasting Network (BBN)]], among others.\n\nIn the [[United States|U.S.]], the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s saw a resurgence of [[revival meeting|revival-tent]] [[preacher|preaching]] in the [[Midwest]] and [[U.S. Southern states|South]], as itinerant traveling preachers drove from town to town, living off [[donation]]s. Several preachers began radio shows as a result of their popularity. One of the first ministers to use radio extensively was [[S. Parkes Cadman]], beginning in 1923.<ref>{{cite news|title=S.

Radio eventually gave her nationwide notoriety in the 1920s and 1930s and she even built one of the earliest [[Pentecostal]] [[megachurches]].\n\nIn the 1930s, a famous radio evangelist of the period was [[Roman Catholic]] priest Father [[Charles Coughlin]], whose strongly [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] radio programs reached millions of listeners.

For example, preacher [[John F. MacArthur|John MacArthur]] published a number of articles in December 2009 that were highly critical of some televangelists.\n\n{{quote|text=Someone needs to say this plainly: The faith healers and health-and-wealth preachers who dominate religious television are shameless frauds. Their message is not the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. There is nothing spiritual or miraculous about their on-stage chicanery. It is all a devious ruse designed to take advantage of desperate people. They are not Godly ministers but greedy impostors who corrupt the Word of God for money's sake. They are not real pastors who shepherd the flock of God but hirelings whose only design is to fleece the sheep. Their love of money is glaringly obvious in what they say as well as how they live. They claim to possess great spiritual power, but in reality they are rank materialists and enemies of everything holy.|sign=[[John F. MacArthur|John MacArthur]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gty.org/Blog/B091207|title=A Colossal Fraud|website=Grace to You}}</ref>}}\n\nSimilarly, [[Ole Anthony]] wrote very critically of televangelists in 1994.<ref>[http://www.trinityfi.org/investigations/roots_corruption.html Corruption in Televangelism and Paganism in the American Church]. September 23, 1994. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812112353/http://www.trinityfi.org/investigations/roots_corruption.html |date=August 12, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nA proportion of their methods and theology are held by some to be conflicting with Christian doctrine taught in long existing traditionalist congregations. Many televangelists are featured by \"discernment ministries\" run by other Christians that are concerned about what they perceive as departures from sound Christian doctrine.\n\n* Many televangelists exist outside the structures of Christian denominations, meaning that they are not accountable to anyone.\n* The financial practices of many televangelists are unclear. A 2003 survey by the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' indicated that only one out of the 17 televangelists researched were members of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinityfi.org/press/JoyceMeyer4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523062020/http://www.trinityfi.org/press/JoyceMeyer4.html |archivedate=2010-05-23 }}</ref>\n* The [[prosperity gospel]] taught by many televangelists promises material, financial, physical, and spiritual success to believers, which can run counter to several aspects of Christian teaching that warn of suffering for following Christ and recommend surrendering one's material possessions ''(see: [[Jesus and the rich young man]])''.\n* Some televangelists have significant personal wealth and own large properties, luxury cars, and various transportation vehicles such as private aircraft or ministry aircraft. This is seen by critics to be contradictory to traditional Christian thinking.<ref>See, for example, {{cite web |url=http://www.fox8live.com/news/local/story/duplantis-mille-tax-problems-ministries-zurik/w8ceY7VaLUW7QV2Gvy9WMg.cspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530052353/http://www.fox8live.com/news/local/story/duplantis-mille-tax-problems-ministries-zurik/w8ceY7VaLUW7QV2Gvy9WMg.cspx |archivedate=2010-05-30 }}</ref>\n* Televangelism requires substantial amounts of money to produce programs and purchase airtime on cable and satellite networks. Televangelists devote time to fundraising activities. Products such as books, CDs, DVDs, and trinkets are promoted to viewers.\n* Televangelists claim to be reaching millions of people worldwide with the gospel and producing numerous converts to [[Christianity]]. However, such claims are difficult to verify independently and are often disputed.<ref>Calvin L Smith wrote at http://www.calvinlsmith.com/2010/05/televangelism.html, \"Thus, despite a clear market demand for religious broadcasting... the evidence is that, ironically, the medium actually wins very few converts and is completely ineffective as an evangelistic tool. Instead religious broadcasting is primarily aimed at and viewed by Christians...\"</ref>\n* Several televangelists are very active in the national or international political arena (e.g., [[Pat Robertson]], [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Jimmy Swaggart]], [[John Hagee]]), and often espouse [[conservative]] politics on their programs. Such televangelists may occasionally arouse controversy by making remarks deemed offensive on their programs or elsewhere, or by endorsing partisan political candidates on donor-paid airtime, which runs afoul of the [[Johnson Amendment]]'s ban on [[501(c)(3) organization|tax-exempt organizations]] supporting or opposing candidates for political office.\n\nTelevangelists often strongly dispute these criticisms and say they are doing God's work. They cite declining attendance at traditional church services and the growth of global mass media as factors necessitating the use of television to \"fulfill the '[[Great Commission]]' of the Gospel of Jesus to the generation of the 21st Century.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n<br />\n\n== Moral Majority Rhetoric ==\nThe rhetoric of Jerry Fallwell was called the Moral Majority. This [[Rhetoric|rehtoric]] was male centered. It was meant to powerfully reaffirm those on the Christain right, and anger outsiders. It was aimed at evangelical christians specifically.<ref>Wilcox, C. (1988). Sources of Support for the Old Right: A Comparison of the John Birch Society and the Christian Anti-Communism Crusade. Social Science History, 12(4), 429-449. doi:10.2307/1171382</ref> Although it was not as hypermasuline or millitant as rhetorics that would come later, it still had some of those aspects. It\u2019s goal was to solidify evangelical Christians to a specific subset of their beliefs, and make them more fundamental. It was also rhetoric designed to convert fundamentalist Christians, previously unpolitical, into active conservatives. The message was aimed more at men but it was meant to have an effect on women as well.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Harding|first=Susan|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctv301gc8|title=The Book of Jerry Falwell: Fundamentalist Language and Politics|date=2018-06-26|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-19046-4|doi=10.2307/j.ctv301gc8.11}}</ref> Pat Robertson also used Moral Majority rhetoric in his televagelism.

Some televangelists are also regular [[pastor]]s or ministers in their own places of worship (often a [[megachurch]]), but the majority of their followers come from TV and radio audiences. Others do not have a conventional congregation, and work primarily through television. The term is also used derisively by critics as an insinuation of aggrandizement by such ministers.\n\nTelevangelism began as a uniquely American phenomenon, resulting from a [[Television in the United States|largely deregulated media]] where access to [[television network]]s and [[cable TV]] is open to virtually anyone who can afford it, combined with a [[Christianity in the United States|large Christian population]] that is able to provide the necessary funding. It became especially popular among [[Evangelical Protestant]] audiences, whether independent or organized around Christian denominations. However, the increasing globalisation of broadcasting has enabled some American televangelists to reach a wider audience through international broadcast networks, including some that are specifically Christian in nature, such as [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] and [[The God Channel]]. Domestically produced televangelism is increasingly present in some other nations such as [[Brazil]].\n\nSome countries have a more regulated media with either general restrictions on access or specific rules regarding religious broadcasting. In such countries, religious programming is typically produced by TV companies (sometimes as a regulatory or public service requirement) rather than private [[interest group]]s.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe word ''televangelism'' is a [[portmanteau]] of [[television]] and [[evangelism]] and it was coined in 1958 as the title of a television miniseries by the [[Southern Baptist Convention]].<ref name=Stewart>{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Tim|title=televangelism|url=http://www.dictionaryofchristianese.com/televangelism/|website=Dictionary of Christianese|accessdate=March 25, 2016|date=January 13, 2015}}</ref> [[Jeffrey K.

Parkes Cadman]], one of the first ministers to use radio, beginning in 1923]]\nChristianity has always emphasized [[Good News (Christianity)|preaching the gospel]] to the whole world, taking as inspiration the [[Great Commission]]. Historically, this was achieved by sending [[Christian missionaries|missionaries]], beginning with the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]], and later, after the invention of the [[printing press]], included the distribution of [[Bibles]] and [[religious tracts]]. Some Christians realized that the rapid uptake of [[radio]] beginning in the 1920s provided a powerful new tool for this task, and they were amongst the first producers of [[radio programming]]. Radio broadcasts were seen as a complementary activity to traditional missionaries, enabling vast numbers to be reached at relatively low cost, but also enabling Christianity to be preached in countries where this was illegal and missionaries were banned. The aim of Christian radio was to both convert people to Christianity and to provide teaching and support to believers. These activities continue today, particularly in the developing world. [[Shortwave]] radio stations with a Christian format broadcast worldwide, such as [[HCJB]] in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]], [[Family Radio]]'s [[WYFR]], and the [[Bible Broadcasting Network|Bible Broadcasting Network (BBN)]], among others.\n\nIn the [[United States|U.S.]], the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s saw a resurgence of [[revival meeting|revival-tent]] [[preacher|preaching]] in the [[Midwest]] and [[U.S. Southern states|South]], as itinerant traveling preachers drove from town to town, living off [[donation]]s. Several preachers began radio shows as a result of their popularity. One of the first ministers to use radio extensively was [[S. Parkes Cadman]], beginning in 1923.<ref>{{cite news|title=S.

For example, preacher [[John F.

They are not Godly ministers but greedy impostors who corrupt the Word of God for money's sake. They are not real pastors who shepherd the flock of God but hirelings whose only design is to fleece the sheep. Their love of money is glaringly obvious in what they say as well as how they live.

Many televangelists are featured by \"discernment ministries\" run by other Christians that are concerned about what they perceive as departures from sound Christian doctrine.\n\n* Many televangelists exist outside the structures of Christian denominations, meaning that they are not accountable to anyone.\n* The financial practices of many televangelists are unclear. A 2003 survey by the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' indicated that only one out of the 17 televangelists researched were members of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinityfi.org/press/JoyceMeyer4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523062020/http://www.trinityfi.org/press/JoyceMeyer4.html |archivedate=2010-05-23 }}</ref>\n* The [[prosperity gospel]] taught by many televangelists promises material, financial, physical, and spiritual success to believers, which can run counter to several aspects of Christian teaching that warn of suffering for following Christ and recommend surrendering one's material possessions ''(see: [[Jesus and the rich young man]])''.\n* Some televangelists have significant personal wealth and own large properties, luxury cars, and various transportation vehicles such as private aircraft or ministry aircraft. This is seen by critics to be contradictory to traditional Christian thinking.<ref>See, for example, {{cite web |url=http://www.fox8live.com/news/local/story/duplantis-mille-tax-problems-ministries-zurik/w8ceY7VaLUW7QV2Gvy9WMg.cspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530052353/http://www.fox8live.com/news/local/story/duplantis-mille-tax-problems-ministries-zurik/w8ceY7VaLUW7QV2Gvy9WMg.cspx |archivedate=2010-05-30 }}</ref>\n* Televangelism requires substantial amounts of money to produce programs and purchase airtime on cable and satellite networks. Televangelists devote time to fundraising activities. Products such as books, CDs, DVDs, and trinkets are promoted to viewers.\n* Televangelists claim to be reaching millions of people worldwide with the gospel and producing numerous converts to [[Christianity]]. However, such claims are difficult to verify independently and are often disputed.<ref>Calvin L Smith wrote at http://www.calvinlsmith.com/2010/05/televangelism.html, \"Thus, despite a clear market demand for religious broadcasting... the evidence is that, ironically, the medium actually wins very few converts and is completely ineffective as an evangelistic tool. Instead religious broadcasting is primarily aimed at and viewed by Christians...\"</ref>\n* Several televangelists are very active in the national or international political arena (e.g., [[Pat Robertson]], [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Jimmy Swaggart]], [[John Hagee]]), and often espouse [[conservative]] politics on their programs. Such televangelists may occasionally arouse controversy by making remarks deemed offensive on their programs or elsewhere, or by endorsing partisan political candidates on donor-paid airtime, which runs afoul of the [[Johnson Amendment]]'s ban on [[501(c)(3) organization|tax-exempt organizations]] supporting or opposing candidates for political office.\n\nTelevangelists often strongly dispute these criticisms and say they are doing God's work. They cite declining attendance at traditional church services and the growth of global mass media as factors necessitating the use of television to \"fulfill the '[[Great Commission]]' of the Gospel of Jesus to the generation of the 21st Century.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n<br />\n\n== Moral Majority Rhetoric ==\nThe rhetoric of Jerry Fallwell was called the Moral Majority.

By contrast, [[List of banana cultivars|''Musa'' cultivars]] with firmer, starchier fruit are called \"plantains\". In other regions, such as [[Southeast Asia]], many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the binary distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages.\n\nThe term \"banana\" is also used as the common name for the plants that produce the fruit.<ref name=MW/> This can extend to other members of the genus ''Musa'', such as the [[Musa coccinea|scarlet banana]] (''Musa coccinea''), the [[Musa velutina|pink banana]] (''Musa velutina''), and the [[Fe'i banana]]s. It can also refer to members of the genus ''[[Ensete]]'', such as the [[Ensete glaucum|snow banana]] (''Ensete glaucum'') and the economically important [[Ensete ventricosum|false banana]] (''Ensete ventricosum'').

Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60&nbsp;cm deep, has good drainage and is not compacted.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|p=212}} The leaves of banana plants are composed of a \"stalk\" ([[petiole (botany)|petiole]]) and a blade ([[Leaf#General characteristics of leaves|lamina]]). The base of the petiole widens to form a sheath; the tightly packed sheaths make up the pseudostem, which is all that supports the plant. The edges of the sheath meet when it is first produced, making it tubular. As new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem the edges are forced apart.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=13\u201317}} Cultivated banana plants vary in height depending on the variety and growing conditions. Most are around {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} tall, with a range from 'Dwarf Cavendish' plants at around {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} to 'Gros Michel' at {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} or more.{{sfn|Nelson|Ploetz|Kepler|2006|p=26}}{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=12}} Leaves are spirally arranged and may grow {{convert|2.7|m|ft}} long and {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name=\"purdue1\"/> They are easily torn by the wind, resulting in the familiar frond look.<ref name=Greenearth/>\n\nWhen a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike or [[inflorescence]]. A stem develops which grows up inside the pseudostem, carrying the immature inflorescence until eventually it emerges at the top.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=9\u201313}} Each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence, also known as the \"banana heart\". (More are sometimes produced; an exceptional plant in the Philippines produced five.<ref name=ABS_CBN/>) After fruiting, the pseudostem dies, but offshoots will normally have developed from the base, so that the plant as a whole is [[perennial]]. In the plantation system of cultivation, only one of the offshoots will be allowed to develop in order to maintain spacing.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=244\u2013247}} The inflorescence contains many [[bract]]s (sometimes incorrectly referred to as petals) between rows of flowers. The female flowers (which can develop into fruit) appear in rows further up the stem (closer to the leaves) from the rows of male flowers. The ovary is [[ovary (plants)|inferior]], meaning that the tiny petals and other flower parts appear at the tip of the ovary.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008}}\n\nThe banana fruits develop from the banana heart, in a large hanging cluster, made up of tiers (called \"hands\"), with up to 20 fruit to a tier. The hanging cluster is known as a bunch, comprising 3\u201320 [[wikt:tier#noun 2|tiers]], or commercially as a \"banana stem\", and can weigh {{convert|30|\u2013|50|kg|lb}}. Individual banana fruits (commonly known as a banana or \"finger\") average {{convert|125|g|lb}}, of which approximately 75% is [[water]] and 25% dry matter (nutrient table, lower right).\n\nThe fruit has been described as a \"leathery berry\".<ref name=Smit77/> There is a protective outer layer (a [[Peel (fruit)|peel]] or skin) with numerous long, thin strings (the [[phloem]] [[Vascular bundle|bundles]]), which run lengthwise between the skin and the [[Eating|edible]] inner portion.

The [[APG III system]] assigns Musaceae to the order [[Zingiberales]], part of the [[commelinid]] clade of the [[monocotyledon]]ous flowering plants. Some 70 species of ''Musa'' were recognized by the [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] {{asof|2013|January|lc=yes}};<ref name=WCSP_Musa/> several produce edible fruit, while others are cultivated as ornamentals.<ref name=Bail16/>\n\nThe classification of cultivated bananas has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists. Linnaeus originally placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: ''Musa sapientum'' for dessert bananas and ''Musa paradisiaca'' for [[Plantain (true)|plantains]]. More species names were added, but this approach proved to be inadequate for the number of [[cultivar]]s in the primary center of diversity of the genus, Southeast Asia. Many of these cultivars were given names that were later discovered to be [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000}}\n\nIn a series of papers published from 1947 onwards, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus's ''Musa sapientum'' and ''Musa paradisiaca'' were cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species, ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]'', both first described by [[Luigi Aloysius Colla]].<ref name=DRC/> Cheesman recommended the abolition of Linnaeus's species in favor of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars \u2013 those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of ''Musa balbisiana'', those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of ''Musa acuminata'', and those with characteristics of both.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000}} Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955. This system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to cultivated varieties. Despite this, the original names are still recognized by some authorities, leading to confusion.<ref name=DRC/><ref name=Porc02/>\n\nThe accepted [[Botanical name|scientific names]] for most groups of cultivated bananas are ''Musa acuminata'' <small>Colla</small> and ''Musa balbisiana'' <small>Colla</small> for the ancestral species, and ''Musa'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca'' <small>L.</small> for the hybrid ''M. acuminata'' \u00d7 ''M. balbisiana''.<ref name=WCSP_Mp/>\n\n[[Synonym (taxonomy)|Synonyms]] of ''M.'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca'' include\n* many subspecific and varietial names of ''M.'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca'', including ''M. p.'' subsp.

''paradisiaca'' <small>(L.) Baker, nom. illeg.</small>\n\nGenerally, modern classifications of banana cultivars follow Simmonds and Shepherd's system. Cultivars are placed in groups based on the number of chromosomes they have and which species they are derived from. Thus the [[Latundan banana]] is placed in the AAB Group, showing that it is a triploid derived from both ''M. acuminata'' (A) and ''M. balbisiana'' (B). For a list of the cultivars classified under this system, ''see'' \"[[List of banana cultivars]]\".\n\nIn 2012, a team of scientists announced they had achieved a draft sequence of the genome of ''[[Musa acuminata]]''.<ref name=dHon12/>\n\n==Bananas and plantains==\nIn regions such as North America and Europe, ''Musa'' fruits offered for sale can be divided into \"bananas\" and \"[[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]]\", based on their intended use as food. Thus the banana producer and distributor [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]] produces publicity material for the American market which says that \"a plantain is not a banana\". The stated differences are that plantains are more [[starch]]y and less sweet; they are eaten cooked rather than raw; they have thicker skin, which may be green, yellow or black; and they can be used at any stage of ripeness.<ref name=Chiquita/> Linnaeus made the same distinction between plantains and bananas when first naming two \"species\" of ''Musa''.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|p=2}} Members of the \"[[Plantain (true)|plantain subgroup]]\" of banana cultivars, most important as food in West Africa and Latin America, correspond to the Chiquita description, having long pointed fruit. They are described by Ploetz et al. as \"true\" plantains, distinct from other cooking bananas.{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|pp=18\u201319}} The cooking bananas of East Africa belong to a different group, the [[East African Highland banana]]s,{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=12}} so would not qualify as \"true\" plantains on this definition.\n[[File:Bananas white background DS.jpg|thumb|[[Cavendish bananas]] are the most common dessert bananas sold]]\nAn alternative approach divides bananas into dessert bananas and cooking bananas, with plantains being one of the subgroups of cooking bananas.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008|p=1}} [[Polyploid|Triploid]] cultivars derived solely from ''M.&nbsp;acuminata'' are examples of \"dessert bananas\", whereas triploid cultivars derived from the hybrid between ''M.&nbsp;acuminata'' and ''M.&nbsp;balbinosa'' (in particular the plantain subgroup of the [[List of banana cultivars#AAB Group|AAB Group]]) are \"plantains\".<ref name=StovSimm87p183/><ref name=QiMoorOrch00/> Small farmers in Colombia grow a much wider range of cultivars than large commercial plantations. A study of these cultivars showed that they could be placed into at least three groups based on their characteristics: dessert bananas, non-plantain cooking bananas, and plantains, although there were overlaps between dessert and cooking bananas.<ref name=GibeDufoGiraSanc09/>\n\nIn Southeast Asia \u2013 the center of diversity for bananas, both wild and cultivated \u2013 the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" does not work, according to Valmayor et al. Many bananas are used both raw and cooked. There are starchy cooking bananas which are smaller than those eaten raw. The range of colors, sizes and shapes is far wider than in those grown or sold in Africa, Europe or the Americas.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|p=2}} Southeast Asian languages do not make the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" that is made in English (and Spanish). Thus both [[#Cavendish|Cavendish cultivars]], the classic yellow dessert bananas, and [[Saba banana|Saba cultivars]], used mainly for cooking, are called ''pisang'' in Malaysia and Indonesia, ''kluai'' in Thailand and ''chuoi'' in Vietnam.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|pp=8\u201312}} [[Fe'i banana]]s, grown and eaten in the islands of the Pacific, are derived from entirely different wild species than traditional bananas and plantains. Most Fe'i bananas are cooked, but [[Karat banana]]s, which are short and squat with bright red skins, very different from the usual yellow dessert bananas, are eaten raw.<ref name=Engl03/>\n\nIn summary, in commerce in Europe and the Americas (although not in small-scale cultivation), it is possible to distinguish between \"bananas\", which are eaten raw, and \"plantains\", which are cooked. In other regions of the world, particularly India, Southeast Asia and the islands of the Pacific, there are many more kinds of banana and the two-fold distinction is not useful and not made in local languages. Plantains are one of many kinds of cooking bananas, which are not always distinct from dessert bananas.\n\n==Historical cultivation==\n\n===Early cultivation===\n{{See also|Musa acuminata|Domesticated plants and animals of Austronesia|East African Highland bananas}}\n[[File:Banana ancestors (Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana) original range.png|thumb|Original [[Range (biology)|native ranges]] of the ancestors of modern edible bananas.

It involved the combination of modern transportation networks of steamships and railroads with the development of refrigeration that allowed more time between harvesting and ripening. North American shippers like [[Lorenzo Dow Baker]] and [[Andrew Preston]], the founders of the [[Boston Fruit Company]] started this process in the 1870s, but railroad builders like [[Minor C.

In many cases the farmer earns additional money from other crops, from engaging in labor outside the farm, and from a share of the earnings of relatives living overseas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursehero.com/file/poj7td/The-earliest-modern-plantations-originated-in-Jamaica-and-the-related-Western/|title=The earliest modern plantations originated in Jamaica and the related Western|work=www.coursehero.com|language=en|access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBanana crops are vulnerable to destruction by high winds, such as tropical storms or [[cyclone]]s.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n==Modern cultivation==\nAll widely cultivated bananas today descend from the two wild bananas ''Musa acuminata'' and ''Musa balbisiana''. While the original wild bananas contained large seeds, [[diploid]] or [[polyploid]] cultivars (some being [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]) with tiny seeds are preferred for human raw fruit consumption.<ref name=Cast09/> These are propagated [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] from offshoots. The plant is allowed to produce two shoots at a time; a larger one for immediate fruiting and a smaller \"sucker\" or \"follower\" to produce fruit in 6\u20138 months.\n\nAs a non-seasonal crop, bananas are available fresh year-round.<ref>{{cite web|title=How bananas are grown|url=http://www.bananalink.org.uk/how-bananas-are-grown|website=Banana Link|accessdate=September 2, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906115526/http://www.bananalink.org.uk/how-bananas-are-grown|archivedate=September 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Cavendish===\n{{main|Cavendish bananas}}\n[[File:Bananas.jpg|thumb|alt=Grocery store photo of several bunches of bananas|[[Cavendish bananas]] are the main commercial banana cultivars sold in the world market.]]\n\nIn global commerce in 2009, by far the most important cultivars belonged to the triploid [[List of banana cultivars#AAA Group|AAA]] [[cultivar group|group]] of ''Musa acuminata'', commonly referred to as Cavendish group bananas. They accounted for the majority of banana exports,<ref name=Cast09/> despite only coming into existence in 1836.<ref name=Homecooking/> The cultivars [[Dwarf Cavendish]] and [[Grand Nain]] (Chiquita Banana) gained popularity in the 1950s after the previous mass-produced cultivar, [[Gros Michel banana|Gros Michel]] (also an AAA group cultivar), became commercially unviable due to [[Panama disease]], caused by the fungus ''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]'' which attacks the roots of the banana plant.<ref name=Cast09/> Cavendish cultivars are resistant to the Panama disease, but in 2013 there were fears that the [[black sigatoka]] fungus would in turn make Cavendish bananas unviable.<ref name=Holmes/>\n\nEven though it is no longer viable for large scale cultivation, Gros Michel is not extinct and is still grown in areas where Panama disease is not found.<ref name=straightdope/> Likewise, Dwarf Cavendish and Grand Nain are in no danger of extinction, but they may leave supermarket shelves if disease makes it impossible to supply the global market. It is unclear if any existing cultivar can replace Cavendish bananas, so various [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] and [[genetic engineering]] programs are attempting to create a disease-resistant, mass-market banana.<ref name=Cast09/>  One such strain that has emerged is the Taiwanese Cavendish, also known as the Formosana.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gittleson |first1=Kim|title=Battling to save the world's bananas| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42777803 |accessdate=April 18, 2018| agency=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Ripening===\nExport bananas are picked green, and ripen in special rooms upon arrival in the destination country. These rooms are air-tight and filled with [[Ethylene|ethylene gas]] to induce ripening. The vivid yellow color consumers normally associate with supermarket bananas is, in fact, caused by the artificial ripening process.<ref name=Ding07/> Flavor and texture are also affected by ripening temperature. Bananas are refrigerated to between {{convert|13.5|and|15|C|F}} during transport. At lower temperatures, ripening permanently stalls, and the bananas turn gray as cell walls break down. The skin of ripe bananas quickly blackens in the {{convert|4|C}} environment of a domestic [[refrigerator]], although the fruit inside remains unaffected.\n[[File:Banana-fluorescence-081108.jpg|thumb|left|Ripened bananas (left, under [[sunlight]]) fluoresce in blue when exposed to [[UV light]].|alt=Two adjacent photos of bananas. The left is in sunlight; the right is under ultraviolet light.]]\n\nBananas can be ordered by the retailer \"ungassed\" (''i.e.'' not treated with ethylene), and may show up at the supermarket fully green. {{lang|es|[[Guineos verdes]]}} (green bananas) that have not been gassed will never fully ripen before becoming rotten. Instead of fresh eating, these bananas can be used for cooking, as seen in Jamaican cuisine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/4-ways-use-green-bananas-wont-ripen|title=4 ways to use green bananas that won't ripen|last=Kirschner|first=Chanie|date=January 21, 2016|website=[[Mother Nature Network]]|access-date=April 30, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428035449/http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/stories/4-ways-use-green-bananas-wont-ripen|archivedate=April 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA 2008 study reported that ripe bananas [[fluoresce]] when exposed to [[ultraviolet]] light. This property is attributed to the degradation of [[chlorophyll]] leading to the accumulation of a fluorescent product in the skin of the fruit. The chlorophyll [[breakdown product]] is stabilized by a [[propionate]] [[ester]] group. Banana-plant leaves also fluoresce in the same way. Green (under-ripe) bananas do not fluoresce.<ref name=Mose08/> That paper suggested that this fluorescence could be put to use \"for optical in vivo monitoring of ripening and over-ripening of bananas and other fruit.\"\n{{clear}}\n\n===Storage and transport===\nBananas must be transported over long distances from the tropics to world markets.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=biUhdI19b18C|page=1}}|title=The World Banana Economy, 1985-2002|last=FAO)|first=Pedro Arias (Asesor da|date=2003|publisher=Food & Agriculture Org.|isbn=9789251050576|language=en}}</ref> To obtain maximum shelf life, harvest comes before the fruit is mature. The fruit requires careful handling, rapid transport to ports, cooling, and refrigerated shipping. The goal is to prevent the bananas from producing their natural ripening agent, ethylene. This technology allows storage and transport for 3\u20134 weeks at {{convert|13|C}}. On arrival, bananas are held at about {{convert|17|C}} and treated with a low concentration of ethylene. After a few days, the fruit begins to ripen and is distributed for final sale. Ripe bananas can be held for a few days at home. If bananas are too green, they can be put in a brown paper bag with an apple or tomato overnight to speed up the ripening process.<ref name=ChiquitaRipen/>\n\nCarbon dioxide (which bananas produce) and ethylene absorbents extend fruit life even at high temperatures. This effect can be exploited by packing banana in a [[polyethylene]] bag and including an ethylene absorbent, e.g., [[potassium permanganate]], on an inert carrier. The bag is then sealed with a band or string. This treatment has been shown to more than double lifespans up to 3\u20134 weeks without the need for refrigeration.<ref name=Scot70/><ref name=Scot71/><ref name=Scot74/>\n\n==Production and export==\n{{Image frame\n|width=520<!-- Must be kept at this size at this point (December 2017) -->\n|content ={{Global Heat Maps by Year| title=| table=Banana production.tab| column=tonnes| columnName=tonnes of bananas per year| year=2014|%=}}\n|caption=Annual banana production, measured in tonnes per year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Banana production |url=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/banana-production |website=Our World in Data |accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n|align=right\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"width:24em; margin-left: 1em;\"\n|+ 2017 production (in millions of tonnes)\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:70%;\"| \n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:10%;\"| Bananas\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:10%;\"| Plantains\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:10%;\"| Total\n|-\n|{{Flagu|India}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|30.5||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|30.5\n|-\n|{{Flagu|China}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|11.2||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|11.2\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Philippines}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|6.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|9.2\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Colombia}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.8||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.6||style=\"text-align:center;\"|7.4\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Indonesia}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|7.2||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|7.2\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Ecuador}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|6.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.8||style=\"text-align:center;\"|7.1\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Brazil}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|6.7||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|6.7\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Cameroon}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.5||style=\"text-align:center;\"|5.8\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Democratic Republic of the Congo}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.8||style=\"text-align:center;\"|5.1\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Angola}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.3||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.3\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Guatemala}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.9||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.4||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.3\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Ghana}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.2\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Tanzania}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.5||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.6||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4.1\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Uganda}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.6||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.9\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Nigeria}}||&nbsp;||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.2||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3.2\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Costa Rica}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.6||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.7\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Peru}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0.3||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.0||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.3\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Mexico}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.2||style=\"text-align:center;\"| ||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.2\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Dominican Republic}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1.2||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1.0||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.2\n|-\n|{{Flagu|Vietnam}}||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.1||style=\"text-align:center;\"| ||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2.1\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: center;\" |'''World'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''113.9'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''39.2'''||style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''153.1'''\n|-\n|colspan=4|<small>Source: [[FAOSTAT]] of the [[United Nations]]<ref name=\"faostat17\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC|title=Banana production in 2017, Crops/Regions/World list/Production Quantity (pick lists)|date=2018|publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization, Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT)|accessdate=September 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC</ref> Note: Some countries distinguish between bananas and plantains, but four of the top six producers do not, thus necessitating comparisons using the total for bananas and plantains combined.</small>\n|}\n\nIn 2017, world production of bananas and plantains combined was 153 million tonnes, led by India and China with a combined total of 27% of global production {{cn|date=November 2019}}.

Its predecessor '[[Gros Michel]]', discovered in the 1820s, suffered this fate. Like almost all bananas, Cavendish lacks genetic diversity, which makes it vulnerable to diseases, threatening both commercial cultivation and small-scale subsistence farming.<ref name=NS060613/><ref name=Mont03/> Some commentators remarked that those variants which could replace what much of the world considers a \"typical banana\" are so different that most people would not consider them the same fruit, and blame the decline of the banana on [[mendelian inheritance|monogenetic]] cultivation driven by short-term commercial motives.<ref name=NZH/>\n\n===Panama disease===\n[[Panama disease]] is caused by a [[fusarium]] soil [[fungus]] (Race 1), which enters the plants through the roots and travels with water into the trunk and leaves, producing [[gel]]s and gums that cut off the flow of water and nutrients, causing the plant to [[wilting|wilt]], and exposing the rest of the plant to lethal amounts of sunlight. Prior to 1960, almost all commercial banana production centered on \"Gros Michel\", which was highly susceptible.<ref name=Bark08/> Cavendish was chosen as the replacement for Gros Michel because, among resistant cultivars, it produces the highest quality [[fruit]]. However, more care is required for shipping the Cavendish,<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Natasha|last=Frost|date=February 28, 2018|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/gros-michel-bananas|magazine=Atlas Obscura|title=A Quest for the Gros Michel, the Great Banana of Yesteryear|accessdate=July 24, 2019}}</ref> and its quality compared to Gros Michel is debated.<ref name=\"Lessard\">{{Cite book |title=The Complete Book of Bananas |last=Lessard |first=William |year=1992 |isbn=978-0963316103 |pages=27\u201328}}</ref>\n\nAccording to current sources, a deadly form of Panama disease is infecting Cavendish.

Black Sigatoka (also known as black leaf streak) has spread to banana plantations throughout the tropics from infected banana leaves that were used as packing material. It affects all main cultivars of bananas and plantains (including the Cavendish cultivars<ref name =Holmes/>), impeding [[photosynthesis]] by blackening parts of the leaves, eventually killing the entire leaf. Starved for energy, fruit production falls by 50% or more, and the bananas that do grow [[ripening|ripen]] prematurely, making them unsuitable for export.

Depending upon cultivar and ripeness, the flesh can vary in taste from starchy to sweet, and texture from firm to mushy. Both the skin and inner part can be eaten raw or cooked. The primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas is [[isoamyl acetate]] (also known as ''banana oil''), which, along with several other compounds such as [[butyl acetate]] and [[isobutyl acetate]], is a significant contributor to banana flavor.<ref name=Fahl00/><ref name=Mui02/><ref name=Salm96/>\n\nDuring the ripening process, bananas produce the gas [[ethylene]], which acts as a [[plant hormone]] and indirectly affects the flavor. Among other things, ethylene stimulates the formation of [[amylase]], an [[enzyme]] that breaks down starch into sugar, influencing the taste of bananas. The greener, less ripe bananas contain higher levels of starch and, consequently, have a \"starchier\" taste. On the other hand, yellow bananas taste sweeter due to higher sugar concentrations. Furthermore, ethylene signals the production of [[pectinase]], an enzyme which breaks down the [[pectin]] between the cells of the banana, causing the banana to soften as it ripens.<ref name=plantphys/><ref name=newton/>\n\nBananas are eaten deep fried, baked in their skin in a split [[bamboo]], or steamed in [[glutinous rice]] wrapped in a banana leaf. Bananas can be made into [[fruit preserves]]. Banana [[pancake]]s are popular among travelers in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. This has elicited the expression ''[[Banana Pancake Trail]]'' for those places in Asia that cater to these travelers. [[Banana chips]] are a snack produced from sliced dehydrated or fried banana or plantain, which have a dark brown color and an intense banana taste. Dried bananas are also ground to make [[banana flour]]. Extracting juice is difficult, because when a banana is compressed, it simply turns to pulp. Bananas feature prominently in [[Philippine cuisine]], being part of traditional dishes and desserts like ''[[Maruya (Filipino cuisine)|maruya]]'', ''[[Tur\u00f3n (food)|tur\u00f3n]]'', and ''[[halo-halo]]'' or ''saba con yelo''. Most of these dishes use the [[Saba Banana]] or Cardaba banana cultivar. Bananas are also commonly used in cuisine in the South-Indian state of [[Kerala]], where they are steamed (''puzhungiyathu''), made into curries,<ref name=pazhampachadi/> fried into chips, (''upperi'')<ref name=Hindu130413/> or fried in batter (''pazhampori'').<ref name=Hindu110228/> [[Pisang goreng]], bananas fried with batter similar to the Filipino ''maruya'' or Kerala ''pazhampori'', is a popular dessert in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. A similar dish is known in the United Kingdom and United States as banana [[fritter]]s.\n\nPlantains are used in various stews and curries or cooked, baked or mashed in much the same way as [[potatoes]], such as the [[pazham pachadi]] dish prepared in [[Kerala]].<ref name=pazhampachadi/>\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=4|\n|width=160 | height=170\n|align=center\n|image1=\u0c05\u0c30\u0c1f\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c2f \u0c2e\u0c30\u0c3f\u0c2f\u0c41 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c2e\u0c4d\u0c2e\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c2f \u0c2a\u0c41\u0c32\u0c41\u0c38\u0c41 \u0c15\u0c42\u0c30.jpg\n|caption1=Banana with Lemon curry made in a house in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India\n|image2 =Bananajf.jpg\n|caption2 =''Kilawin na pus\u00f4 ng saging'', a [[Cuisine of the Philippines|Filipino dish]] using banana flowers\n|image3 =Nacatamales in steamer.jpg\n|caption3=Nicaraguan [[Nacatamal]]es, in banana leaves, ready to be steamed\n|image4 =Kaeng yuak.JPG\n|caption4= ''Kaeng yuak'' is a northern [[Thai curry]] made with the core of the banana plant\n|image5=Pisang goreng in a basket.jpg\n|caption5=''[[Pisang goreng]]'' fried banana coated in batter,  [[Indonesian cuisine|popular snack in Indonesia]]\n|image6=YosriPengatPisang.jpg\n|caption6=Banana in sweet gravy, known as ''pengat pisang'' in Malaysia\n}}\n\n====Flower====\nBanana hearts are used as a [[vegetable]]<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.asiafood.org/glossary_1.cfm?alpha=B&wordid=3219&startno=1&endno=25 |title=Encyclopedia of Asian Food |year=1998 |last=Solomon |first=C |publisher=New Holland Publishers |location=Australia |edition=Periplus |accessdate=May 17, 2008 |isbn=978-0-85561-688-5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603142416/http://www.asiafood.org/glossary_1.cfm?alpha=B&wordid=3219&startno=1&endno=25 |archive-date=June 3, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> in [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] and [[Southeast Asian cuisine]], either raw or steamed with dips or cooked in soups, curries and fried foods.<ref>[http://www.dudaonline.com/southeast-asia/thailand/fried-banana-flowers/ Fried banana flowers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405093613/http://www.dudaonline.com/southeast-asia/thailand/fried-banana-flowers/ |date=April 5, 2011 }}.

Especially in the Americas and Europe, \"banana\" usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those of the [[#Cavendish|Cavendish group]], which are the main exports from banana-growing countries. By contrast, [[List of banana cultivars|''Musa'' cultivars]] with firmer, starchier fruit are called \"plantains\". In other regions, such as [[Southeast Asia]], many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the binary distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages.\n\nThe term \"banana\" is also used as the common name for the plants that produce the fruit.<ref name=MW/> This can extend to other members of the genus ''Musa'', such as the [[Musa coccinea|scarlet banana]] (''Musa coccinea''), the [[Musa velutina|pink banana]] (''Musa velutina''), and the [[Fe'i banana]]s. It can also refer to members of the genus ''[[Ensete]]'', such as the [[Ensete glaucum|snow banana]] (''Ensete glaucum'') and the economically important [[Ensete ventricosum|false banana]] (''Ensete ventricosum''). Both genera are in the banana family, [[Musaceae]].\n\n==Description==\n<gallery>\nFile:Banana corm.jpg|A banana corm, about {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} across\nFile:M. acuminata x balbisiana female flower detail.jpg|Female flowers have petals at the tip of the ovary\nFile:2018 06 TropicalIslands IMG 2170.jpg|Banana 'tree' showing fruit and [[inflorescence]]\nFile:Banana tree in Chandigarh.jpg|Banana tree with opening inflorescence\nFile:M. acuminata x balbisiana.JPG|Banana inflorescence, partially opened\nFile:Banana three in R\u00e9union.jpg|Wild banana with flowers and stem growing in reverse direction\nFile:Banana's DNA Strand.jpg|Extracted banana's DNA strands that can be seen with naked eyes\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Baby Banana Plant.jpg|thumb|upright|Young banana plant]]\nThe banana plant is the largest [[herbaceous]] flowering plant.<ref name=PicqINIB00/> All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a \"[[corm]]\".{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=5\u20139}} Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy, and are often mistaken for [[tree]]s, but what appears to be a trunk is actually a \"false stem\" or [[pseudostem]]. Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60&nbsp;cm deep, has good drainage and is not compacted.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|p=212}} The leaves of banana plants are composed of a \"stalk\" ([[petiole (botany)|petiole]]) and a blade ([[Leaf#General characteristics of leaves|lamina]]). The base of the petiole widens to form a sheath; the tightly packed sheaths make up the pseudostem, which is all that supports the plant. The edges of the sheath meet when it is first produced, making it tubular. As new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem the edges are forced apart.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=13\u201317}} Cultivated banana plants vary in height depending on the variety and growing conditions. Most are around {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} tall, with a range from 'Dwarf Cavendish' plants at around {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} to 'Gros Michel' at {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} or more.{{sfn|Nelson|Ploetz|Kepler|2006|p=26}}{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=12}} Leaves are spirally arranged and may grow {{convert|2.7|m|ft}} long and {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name=\"purdue1\"/> They are easily torn by the wind, resulting in the familiar frond look.<ref name=Greenearth/>\n\nWhen a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike or [[inflorescence]]. A stem develops which grows up inside the pseudostem, carrying the immature inflorescence until eventually it emerges at the top.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=9\u201313}} Each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence, also known as the \"banana heart\". (More are sometimes produced; an exceptional plant in the Philippines produced five.<ref name=ABS_CBN/>) After fruiting, the pseudostem dies, but offshoots will normally have developed from the base, so that the plant as a whole is [[perennial]]. In the plantation system of cultivation, only one of the offshoots will be allowed to develop in order to maintain spacing.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=244\u2013247}} The inflorescence contains many [[bract]]s (sometimes incorrectly referred to as petals) between rows of flowers. The female flowers (which can develop into fruit) appear in rows further up the stem (closer to the leaves) from the rows of male flowers. The ovary is [[ovary (plants)|inferior]], meaning that the tiny petals and other flower parts appear at the tip of the ovary.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008}}\n\nThe banana fruits develop from the banana heart, in a large hanging cluster, made up of tiers (called \"hands\"), with up to 20 fruit to a tier. The hanging cluster is known as a bunch, comprising 3\u201320 [[wikt:tier#noun 2|tiers]], or commercially as a \"banana stem\", and can weigh {{convert|30|\u2013|50|kg|lb}}. Individual banana fruits (commonly known as a banana or \"finger\") average {{convert|125|g|lb}}, of which approximately 75% is [[water]] and 25% dry matter (nutrient table, lower right).\n\nThe fruit has been described as a \"leathery berry\".<ref name=Smit77/> There is a protective outer layer (a [[Peel (fruit)|peel]] or skin) with numerous long, thin strings (the [[phloem]] [[Vascular bundle|bundles]]), which run lengthwise between the skin and the [[Eating|edible]] inner portion. The inner part of the common yellow dessert variety can be split lengthwise into three sections that correspond to the inner portions of the three [[carpel]]s by manually deforming the unopened fruit.<ref name=Wark04/> In cultivated varieties, the seeds are diminished nearly to non-existence; their remnants are tiny black specks in the interior of the fruit.<ref name=Simm62/>\n\n===Banana equivalent radiation dose===\n\nAs with all potassium-containing objects on Earth, including many common foods and people, bananas emit [[radioactivity]] at very low levels occurring naturally from [[potassium-40]] (<sup>40</sup>K or K-40),<ref name=\"frame\">{{cite web |author1=Paul Frame |title=General information about K-40 |url=https://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/consumer%20products/potassiumgeneralinfo.htm |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |accessdate=April 24, 2019 |date=January 20, 2009|quote=The human body maintains relatively tight homeostatic control over potassium levels.

The [[APG III system]] assigns Musaceae to the order [[Zingiberales]], part of the [[commelinid]] clade of the [[monocotyledon]]ous flowering plants. Some 70 species of ''Musa'' were recognized by the [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] {{asof|2013|January|lc=yes}};<ref name=WCSP_Musa/> several produce edible fruit, while others are cultivated as ornamentals.<ref name=Bail16/>\n\nThe classification of cultivated bananas has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists. Linnaeus originally placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: ''Musa sapientum'' for dessert bananas and ''Musa paradisiaca'' for [[Plantain (true)|plantains]]. More species names were added, but this approach proved to be inadequate for the number of [[cultivar]]s in the primary center of diversity of the genus, Southeast Asia. Many of these cultivars were given names that were later discovered to be [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000}}\n\nIn a series of papers published from 1947 onwards, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus's ''Musa sapientum'' and ''Musa paradisiaca'' were cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species, ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]'', both first described by [[Luigi Aloysius Colla]].<ref name=DRC/> Cheesman recommended the abolition of Linnaeus's species in favor of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars \u2013 those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of ''Musa balbisiana'', those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of ''Musa acuminata'', and those with characteristics of both.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000}} Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955. This system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to cultivated varieties. Despite this, the original names are still recognized by some authorities, leading to confusion.<ref name=DRC/><ref name=Porc02/>\n\nThe accepted [[Botanical name|scientific names]] for most groups of cultivated bananas are ''Musa acuminata'' <small>Colla</small> and ''Musa balbisiana'' <small>Colla</small> for the ancestral species, and ''Musa'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca'' <small>L.</small> for the hybrid ''M. acuminata'' \u00d7 ''M. balbisiana''.<ref name=WCSP_Mp/>\n\n[[Synonym (taxonomy)|Synonyms]] of ''M.'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca'' include\n* many subspecific and varietial names of ''M.'' \u00d7 ''paradisiaca'', including ''M. p.'' subsp. ''sapientum'' <small>(L.) Kuntze</small>\n* ''Musa'' \u00d7 ''dacca'' <small>Horan.</small>\n* ''Musa'' \u00d7 ''sapidisiaca'' <small>K.C.Jacob, nom. superfl.</small>\n* ''Musa'' \u00d7 ''sapientum'' <small>L.</small>, and many of its varietal names, including ''M.'' \u00d7 ''sapientum'' var. ''paradisiaca'' <small>(L.) Baker, nom. illeg.</small>\n\nGenerally, modern classifications of banana cultivars follow Simmonds and Shepherd's system. Cultivars are placed in groups based on the number of chromosomes they have and which species they are derived from. Thus the [[Latundan banana]] is placed in the AAB Group, showing that it is a triploid derived from both ''M. acuminata'' (A) and ''M. balbisiana'' (B). For a list of the cultivars classified under this system, ''see'' \"[[List of banana cultivars]]\".\n\nIn 2012, a team of scientists announced they had achieved a draft sequence of the genome of ''[[Musa acuminata]]''.<ref name=dHon12/>\n\n==Bananas and plantains==\nIn regions such as North America and Europe, ''Musa'' fruits offered for sale can be divided into \"bananas\" and \"[[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]]\", based on their intended use as food. Thus the banana producer and distributor [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]] produces publicity material for the American market which says that \"a plantain is not a banana\". The stated differences are that plantains are more [[starch]]y and less sweet; they are eaten cooked rather than raw; they have thicker skin, which may be green, yellow or black; and they can be used at any stage of ripeness.<ref name=Chiquita/> Linnaeus made the same distinction between plantains and bananas when first naming two \"species\" of ''Musa''.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|p=2}} Members of the \"[[Plantain (true)|plantain subgroup]]\" of banana cultivars, most important as food in West Africa and Latin America, correspond to the Chiquita description, having long pointed fruit. They are described by Ploetz et al. as \"true\" plantains, distinct from other cooking bananas.{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|pp=18\u201319}} The cooking bananas of East Africa belong to a different group, the [[East African Highland banana]]s,{{sfn|Ploetz|Kepler|Daniells|Nelson|2007|p=12}} so would not qualify as \"true\" plantains on this definition.\n[[File:Bananas white background DS.jpg|thumb|[[Cavendish bananas]] are the most common dessert bananas sold]]\nAn alternative approach divides bananas into dessert bananas and cooking bananas, with plantains being one of the subgroups of cooking bananas.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008|p=1}} [[Polyploid|Triploid]] cultivars derived solely from ''M.&nbsp;acuminata'' are examples of \"dessert bananas\", whereas triploid cultivars derived from the hybrid between ''M.&nbsp;acuminata'' and ''M.&nbsp;balbinosa'' (in particular the plantain subgroup of the [[List of banana cultivars#AAB Group|AAB Group]]) are \"plantains\".<ref name=StovSimm87p183/><ref name=QiMoorOrch00/> Small farmers in Colombia grow a much wider range of cultivars than large commercial plantations. A study of these cultivars showed that they could be placed into at least three groups based on their characteristics: dessert bananas, non-plantain cooking bananas, and plantains, although there were overlaps between dessert and cooking bananas.<ref name=GibeDufoGiraSanc09/>\n\nIn Southeast Asia \u2013 the center of diversity for bananas, both wild and cultivated \u2013 the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" does not work, according to Valmayor et al. Many bananas are used both raw and cooked. There are starchy cooking bananas which are smaller than those eaten raw. The range of colors, sizes and shapes is far wider than in those grown or sold in Africa, Europe or the Americas.{{sfn|Valmayor|Jamaluddin|Silayoi|Kusumo|2000|p=2}} Southeast Asian languages do not make the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" that is made in English (and Spanish).

Most Fe'i bananas are cooked, but [[Karat banana]]s, which are short and squat with bright red skins, very different from the usual yellow dessert bananas, are eaten raw.<ref name=Engl03/>\n\nIn summary, in commerce in Europe and the Americas (although not in small-scale cultivation), it is possible to distinguish between \"bananas\", which are eaten raw, and \"plantains\", which are cooked. In other regions of the world, particularly India, Southeast Asia and the islands of the Pacific, there are many more kinds of banana and the two-fold distinction is not useful and not made in local languages.

They [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ized with other (possibly independently domesticated) [[subspecies]] of ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' as well as ''[[Musa balbisiana]]'' in the Philippines, northern New Guinea, and possibly [[Halmahera]]. These hybridization events produced the [[triploid]] [[List of banana cultivars|cultivars of bananas]] commonly grown today.

It involved the combination of modern transportation networks of steamships and railroads with the development of refrigeration that allowed more time between harvesting and ripening. North American shippers like [[Lorenzo Dow Baker]] and [[Andrew Preston]], the founders of the [[Boston Fruit Company]] started this process in the 1870s, but railroad builders like [[Minor C. Keith]] also participated, eventually culminating in the multi-national giant corporations like today's [[Chiquita Brands International]] and [[Dole Food Company|Dole]].<ref name=Koep08/> These companies were [[monopoly|monopolistic]], [[vertically integrated]] (meaning they controlled growing, processing, shipping and marketing) and usually used political manipulation to build [[enclave economy|enclave economies]] (economies that were internally self-sufficient, virtually tax exempt, and export-oriented that contribute very little to the host economy). Their political maneuvers, which gave rise to the term [[Banana republic]] for states like Honduras and Guatemala, included working with local elites and their rivalries to influence politics or playing the international interests of the United States, especially during the [[Cold War]], to keep the political climate favorable to their interests.<ref name=NZH/>\n\n===Peasant cultivation for export in the Caribbean===\n{{Main|History of peasant banana production in the Americas}}\n\nThe vast majority of the world's bananas today are cultivated for family consumption or for sale on local markets. India is the world leader in this sort of production, but many other Asian and African countries where climate and soil conditions allow cultivation also host large populations of banana growers who sell at least some of their crop.{{sfn|Office of the Gene Technology Regulator|2008|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nPeasant sector banana growers produce for the world market in the Caribbean, however. The [[Windward Islands]] are notable for the growing, largely of Cavendish bananas, for an international market, generally in Europe but also in North America. In the Caribbean, and especially in Dominica where this sort of cultivation is widespread, holdings are in the 1\u20132 acre range. In many cases the farmer earns additional money from other crops, from engaging in labor outside the farm, and from a share of the earnings of relatives living overseas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursehero.com/file/poj7td/The-earliest-modern-plantations-originated-in-Jamaica-and-the-related-Western/|title=The earliest modern plantations originated in Jamaica and the related Western|work=www.coursehero.com|language=en|access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBanana crops are vulnerable to destruction by high winds, such as tropical storms or [[cyclone]]s.{{sfn|Stover|Simmonds|1987|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n==Modern cultivation==\nAll widely cultivated bananas today descend from the two wild bananas ''Musa acuminata'' and ''Musa balbisiana''.

These rooms are air-tight and filled with [[Ethylene|ethylene gas]] to induce ripening. The vivid yellow color consumers normally associate with supermarket bananas is, in fact, caused by the artificial ripening process.<ref name=Ding07/> Flavor and texture are also affected by ripening temperature. Bananas are refrigerated to between {{convert|13.5|and|15|C|F}} during transport. At lower temperatures, ripening permanently stalls, and the bananas turn gray as cell walls break down. The skin of ripe bananas quickly blackens in the {{convert|4|C}} environment of a domestic [[refrigerator]], although the fruit inside remains unaffected.\n[[File:Banana-fluorescence-081108.jpg|thumb|left|Ripened bananas (left, under [[sunlight]]) fluoresce in blue when exposed to [[UV light]].|alt=Two adjacent photos of bananas.

The fruit requires careful handling, rapid transport to ports, cooling, and refrigerated shipping. The goal is to prevent the bananas from producing their natural ripening agent, ethylene. This technology allows storage and transport for 3\u20134 weeks at {{convert|13|C}}. On arrival, bananas are held at about {{convert|17|C}} and treated with a low concentration of ethylene. After a few days, the fruit begins to ripen and is distributed for final sale. Ripe bananas can be held for a few days at home. If bananas are too green, they can be put in a brown paper bag with an apple or tomato overnight to speed up the ripening process.<ref name=ChiquitaRipen/>\n\nCarbon dioxide (which bananas produce) and ethylene absorbents extend fruit life even at high temperatures. This effect can be exploited by packing banana in a [[polyethylene]] bag and including an ethylene absorbent, e.g., [[potassium permanganate]], on an inert carrier. The bag is then sealed with a band or string.

Like almost all bananas, Cavendish lacks genetic diversity, which makes it vulnerable to diseases, threatening both commercial cultivation and small-scale subsistence farming.<ref name=NS060613/><ref name=Mont03/> Some commentators remarked that those variants which could replace what much of the world considers a \"typical banana\" are so different that most people would not consider them the same fruit, and blame the decline of the banana on [[mendelian inheritance|monogenetic]] cultivation driven by short-term commercial motives.<ref name=NZH/>\n\n===Panama disease===\n[[Panama disease]] is caused by a [[fusarium]] soil [[fungus]] (Race 1), which enters the plants through the roots and travels with water into the trunk and leaves, producing [[gel]]s and gums that cut off the flow of water and nutrients, causing the plant to [[wilting|wilt]], and exposing the rest of the plant to lethal amounts of sunlight. Prior to 1960, almost all commercial banana production centered on \"Gros Michel\", which was highly susceptible.<ref name=Bark08/> Cavendish was chosen as the replacement for Gros Michel because, among resistant cultivars, it produces the highest quality [[fruit]]. However, more care is required for shipping the Cavendish,<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Natasha|last=Frost|date=February 28, 2018|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/gros-michel-bananas|magazine=Atlas Obscura|title=A Quest for the Gros Michel, the Great Banana of Yesteryear|accessdate=July 24, 2019}}</ref> and its quality compared to Gros Michel is debated.<ref name=\"Lessard\">{{Cite book |title=The Complete Book of Bananas |last=Lessard |first=William |year=1992 |isbn=978-0963316103 |pages=27\u201328}}</ref>\n\nAccording to current sources, a deadly form of Panama disease is infecting Cavendish.

Black Sigatoka (also known as black leaf streak) has spread to banana plantations throughout the tropics from infected banana leaves that were used as packing material. It affects all main cultivars of bananas and plantains (including the Cavendish cultivars<ref name =Holmes/>), impeding [[photosynthesis]] by blackening parts of the leaves, eventually killing the entire leaf. Starved for energy, fruit production falls by 50% or more, and the bananas that do grow [[ripening|ripen]] prematurely, making them unsuitable for export.

Depending upon cultivar and ripeness, the flesh can vary in taste from starchy to sweet, and texture from firm to mushy. Both the skin and inner part can be eaten raw or cooked. The primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas is [[isoamyl acetate]] (also known as ''banana oil''), which, along with several other compounds such as [[butyl acetate]] and [[isobutyl acetate]], is a significant contributor to banana flavor.<ref name=Fahl00/><ref name=Mui02/><ref name=Salm96/>\n\nDuring the ripening process, bananas produce the gas [[ethylene]], which acts as a [[plant hormone]] and indirectly affects the flavor. Among other things, ethylene stimulates the formation of [[amylase]], an [[enzyme]] that breaks down starch into sugar, influencing the taste of bananas. The greener, less ripe bananas contain higher levels of starch and, consequently, have a \"starchier\" taste. On the other hand, yellow bananas taste sweeter due to higher sugar concentrations. Furthermore, ethylene signals the production of [[pectinase]], an enzyme which breaks down the [[pectin]] between the cells of the banana, causing the banana to soften as it ripens.<ref name=plantphys/><ref name=newton/>\n\nBananas are eaten deep fried, baked in their skin in a split [[bamboo]], or steamed in [[glutinous rice]] wrapped in a banana leaf. Bananas can be made into [[fruit preserves]]. Banana [[pancake]]s are popular among travelers in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. This has elicited the expression ''[[Banana Pancake Trail]]'' for those places in Asia that cater to these travelers. [[Banana chips]] are a snack produced from sliced dehydrated or fried banana or plantain, which have a dark brown color and an intense banana taste. Dried bananas are also ground to make [[banana flour]]. Extracting juice is difficult, because when a banana is compressed, it simply turns to pulp. Bananas feature prominently in [[Philippine cuisine]], being part of traditional dishes and desserts like ''[[Maruya (Filipino cuisine)|maruya]]'', ''[[Tur\u00f3n (food)|tur\u00f3n]]'', and ''[[halo-halo]]'' or ''saba con yelo''. Most of these dishes use the [[Saba Banana]] or Cardaba banana cultivar. Bananas are also commonly used in cuisine in the South-Indian state of [[Kerala]], where they are steamed (''puzhungiyathu''), made into curries,<ref name=pazhampachadi/> fried into chips, (''upperi'')<ref name=Hindu130413/> or fried in batter (''pazhampori'').<ref name=Hindu110228/> [[Pisang goreng]], bananas fried with batter similar to the Filipino ''maruya'' or Kerala ''pazhampori'', is a popular dessert in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.

Despite the proximity of [[Peterborough]], Whittlesey is in the [[Diocese of Ely]].\n\nUntil it was drained in 1851, nearby [[Whittlesey Mere]] was a substantial lake surrounded by marsh. According to the traveller [[Celia Fiennes]], who saw it in 1697, the mere was \"3-mile broad and six-mile long. In the midst is a little island where a great store of Wildfowle breed.... The ground is all wett and marshy but there are severall little Channells runs into it which by boats people go up to this place; when you enter the mouth of the Mer it looks formidable and its often very dangerous by reason of sudden winds that will rise like Hurricanes....\"<ref>''The Journeys of Celia Fiennes''.
