It is one of the top singles championships for women among WWE's three main brands, along with the [[WWE Raw Women's Championship]] on [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship]] on [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]. The current champion is [[Charlotte Flair]], who is in her record-tying second reign.\n\nIntroduced on April 5, 2013, the title was established as the women's championship for NXT, which at the time was a [[Farm team|developmental territory]] for WWE. The inaugural champion was [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]]. Over the years, NXT grew to become WWE's third major brand, which became official in September 2019 when NXT was moved to the [[USA Network]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Paige as NXT Women's Champion WrestleMania Axxess 2014 3.jpg|thumb|upright|The inaugural NXT Women's Champion [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]], shown here with the original championship belt design]]\nIn June 2012, the [[WWE]] established [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] as their [[Farm team|developmental territory]], replacing [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] (FCW). The following year on April 5, the NXT Women's Championship was introduced during [[WrestleMania Axxess]]. On the May 30 tapings of ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'' ([[Broadcast delay|aired]] June 5), WWE's [[Chief Brand Officer]] [[Stephanie McMahon]] announced that there would be an eight-woman [[single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] [[Professional wrestling tournament|tournament]], featuring four women from NXT and four from WWE's main roster competing to be crowned the first NXT Women's Champion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=WWE NEWS: McMahon's Friday tweet - anti-smoking, Stephanie introduces NXT Women's Title (w/Pic), Cena check-in, Ross new blog, Dupree wins title|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_70982.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Namako|first=Jason|title=WWE NXT Results - 5/30/13 (#1 Contender Battle Royal)|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/41777-wwe-nxt-results-5-30-13-1-contender-battle-royal|work=Wrestleview|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Justin|title=James's WWE NXT results 5/29 & 6/5: Wyatts defend Tag Titles, NXT Women's Title introduced, #1 contender battle royal, Parade of released NXT wrestlers in matches|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwenxtreport/article_71102.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> During the June 20 tapings of ''NXT'' (aired July 24), [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]] defeated [[Emma (wrestler)|Emma]] in the tournament final to become the inaugural champion.<ref name=FirstChamp/>\n\nPaige successfully defended her title at [[NXT Arrival|Arrival]] against Emma, however, then-NXT [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Manager (GM) 4|General Manager]] [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] stripped Paige of the title on the April 24, 2014 episode of ''NXT'', as Paige had recently won the [[WWE Divas Championship]], and was in turn promoted to WWE's main roster. A new tournament began the following week. The finals occurred at [[NXT TakeOver|TakeOver]] where [[Charlotte Flair|Charlotte]] defeated [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]] to win the vacant NXT Women's Championship. On the September 16, 2015 episode of ''NXT'', now NXT General Manager [[William Regal]] announced that [[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]] would defend her title against [[Sasha Banks]] in the [[main event]] at [[NXT TakeOver: Respect|TakeOver: Respect]] on October 7 in the first ever 30-minute [[Iron Man match|Iron Woman match]] in WWE history.<ref name=\"NXTSeptember16\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwenxtreport/article_87531.shtml|title=James's WWE NXT report 9/16 - Week 180: Bayley returns to Full Sail as Women's champ, big set-up for \"Takeover,\" Dusty Tag Classic continues, Adam Rose dumps on NXT, more; Overall Reax|author=James, Justin|website=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}</ref> At the event, Bayley defeated Banks to retain the championship, scoring the win with 3 falls to 2.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Melok|first1=Bobby|title=NXT Women's Champion Bayley vs. Sasha Banks (30-Minute WWE Iron Man Match)|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/nxt-takeover-2015-10-07/bayley-sasha-banks-nxt-womens-title-iron-man-match-27942052|publisher=WWE|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=97087&p=3|title=WWE NXT TakeOver Respect report: Sasha Banks and Bayley go 30 minutes, the first Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic winners crowned, Asuka makes her NXT in ring debut (poor Dana), and more|author=Trionfo, Richard|website=PWInsider|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough NXT had been established as WWE's developmental territory, over the years it grew to establish itself as WWE's third major brand.

At the top of the plate was the WWE logo. The center of the plate was the NXT logo encrusted with pink diamonds; red coloring was behind the letter \"X\". Above the NXT logo read \"Women's\" while below the logo read \"Champion\". There were two side plates, which were skinny and matched the curve of the center plate. The inner side plates were encrusted with pink diamonds, while the outer side plates were blank silver plates. The plates were on a black leather strap. When first introduced, the WWE logo was the long-standing scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nOn April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the existing NXT title belts at the time would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. The redesigned women's championship features a nearly identical design to the [[NXT Championship#Belt design|redesigned NXT Championship]], including being on a black leather strap, but with a couple of notable differences. The belt is smaller to fit the women. The letters \"N X T\" on the center plate are silver instead of gold, while the rest of the plate is gold. One other difference is that a banner reading \"Women's\" is underneath the WWE logo. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the new design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns ==\n<!-- Do NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

It is one of the top singles championships for women among WWE's three main brands, along with the [[WWE Raw Women's Championship]] on [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship]] on [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]. The current champion is [[Charlotte Flair]], who is in her record-tying second reign.\n\nIntroduced on April 5, 2013, the title was established as the women's championship for NXT, which at the time was a [[Farm team|developmental territory]] for WWE. The inaugural champion was [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]]. Over the years, NXT grew to become WWE's third major brand, which became official in September 2019 when NXT was moved to the [[USA Network]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Paige as NXT Women's Champion WrestleMania Axxess 2014 3.jpg|thumb|upright|The inaugural NXT Women's Champion [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]], shown here with the original championship belt design]]\nIn June 2012, the [[WWE]] established [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] as their [[Farm team|developmental territory]], replacing [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] (FCW). The following year on April 5, the NXT Women's Championship was introduced during [[WrestleMania Axxess]]. On the May 30 tapings of ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'' ([[Broadcast delay|aired]] June 5), WWE's [[Chief Brand Officer]] [[Stephanie McMahon]] announced that there would be an eight-woman [[single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] [[Professional wrestling tournament|tournament]], featuring four women from NXT and four from WWE's main roster competing to be crowned the first NXT Women's Champion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=WWE NEWS: McMahon's Friday tweet - anti-smoking, Stephanie introduces NXT Women's Title (w/Pic), Cena check-in, Ross new blog, Dupree wins title|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_70982.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Namako|first=Jason|title=WWE NXT Results - 5/30/13 (#1 Contender Battle Royal)|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/41777-wwe-nxt-results-5-30-13-1-contender-battle-royal|work=Wrestleview|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Justin|title=James's WWE NXT results 5/29 & 6/5: Wyatts defend Tag Titles, NXT Women's Title introduced, #1 contender battle royal, Parade of released NXT wrestlers in matches|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwenxtreport/article_71102.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> During the June 20 tapings of ''NXT'' (aired July 24), [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]] defeated [[Emma (wrestler)|Emma]] in the tournament final to become the inaugural champion.<ref name=FirstChamp/>\n\nPaige successfully defended her title at [[NXT Arrival|Arrival]] against Emma, however, then-NXT [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Manager (GM) 4|General Manager]] [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] stripped Paige of the title on the April 24, 2014 episode of ''NXT'', as Paige had recently won the [[WWE Divas Championship]], and was in turn promoted to WWE's main roster. A new tournament began the following week. The finals occurred at [[NXT TakeOver|TakeOver]] where [[Charlotte Flair|Charlotte]] defeated [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]] to win the vacant NXT Women's Championship. On the September 16, 2015 episode of ''NXT'', now NXT General Manager [[William Regal]] announced that [[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]] would defend her title against [[Sasha Banks]] in the [[main event]] at [[NXT TakeOver: Respect|TakeOver: Respect]] on October 7 in the first ever 30-minute [[Iron Man match|Iron Woman match]] in WWE history.<ref name=\"NXTSeptember16\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwenxtreport/article_87531.shtml|title=James's WWE NXT report 9/16 - Week 180: Bayley returns to Full Sail as Women's champ, big set-up for \"Takeover,\" Dusty Tag Classic continues, Adam Rose dumps on NXT, more; Overall Reax|author=James, Justin|website=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}</ref> At the event, Bayley defeated Banks to retain the championship, scoring the win with 3 falls to 2.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Melok|first1=Bobby|title=NXT Women's Champion Bayley vs. Sasha Banks (30-Minute WWE Iron Man Match)|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/nxt-takeover-2015-10-07/bayley-sasha-banks-nxt-womens-title-iron-man-match-27942052|publisher=WWE|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=97087&p=3|title=WWE NXT TakeOver Respect report: Sasha Banks and Bayley go 30 minutes, the first Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic winners crowned, Asuka makes her NXT in ring debut (poor Dana), and more|author=Trionfo, Richard|website=PWInsider|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough NXT had been established as WWE's developmental territory, over the years it grew to establish itself as WWE's third major brand.

At the top of the plate was the WWE logo. The center of the plate was the NXT logo encrusted with pink diamonds; red coloring was behind the letter \"X\". Above the NXT logo read \"Women's\" while below the logo read \"Champion\". There were two side plates, which were skinny and matched the curve of the center plate. The inner side plates were encrusted with pink diamonds, while the outer side plates were blank silver plates. The plates were on a black leather strap. When first introduced, the WWE logo was the long-standing scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nOn April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the existing NXT title belts at the time would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. The redesigned women's championship features a nearly identical design to the [[NXT Championship#Belt design|redesigned NXT Championship]], including being on a black leather strap, but with a couple of notable differences. The belt is smaller to fit the women. The letters \"N X T\" on the center plate are silver instead of gold, while the rest of the plate is gold. One other difference is that a banner reading \"Women's\" is underneath the WWE logo. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the new design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns ==\n<!-- Do NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

It was named [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], that in old Sundanese means \"a place between the parallel [rivers]\", and became the predecessor of the modern Bogor.<ref name=\"Pasundan\"/><ref name=\"cikalbogor\"/>\n\n[[File:Prasasti tugu.jpg|thumb|A 1600-year-old stone inscription (''prasasti'') of the [[Tarumanagara]] kingdom era.]]\n\nOver the next several centuries, Pakuan Pajajaran become one of the largest cities in medieval Indonesia with population reaching 48,000.<ref name=\"cikalbogor\"/> The name Pajajaran was then used for the entire kingdom, and the capital was simply called Pakuan.<ref name=\"cikalbogor\"/><ref name = \"sunda\"/><ref name=\"cikalbogor2\"/><ref name=\"Koler\"/><ref name=\"Karta\"/> The chronicles of that time were written in [[Sanskrit]], which was the language used for official and religious purposes, using the [[Pallava]] writing system, on rock stellas called prasasti.<ref name=\"History\"/><ref name=\"prasasti\"/> The prasasti found in and around Bogor differ in shape and text style from other Indonesian prasasti and are among the main attractions of the city.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the 9\u201315th centuries, the capital was moving between Pakuan and other cities of the kingdom, and finally returned to Pakuan by [[King Siliwangi]] (''[[Sri Baduga Maharaja]]'') on 3 June 1482 \u2013 the day of his coronation.

The formal transition occurred on 17 April 1684 by signing an agreement between the Crown Prince of Banten and the VOC.<ref name=\"depok2\"/>\n\nThe first, and temporal, colonial settlement at Pakuan was a camp of lieutenant Tanoejiwa, a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] employed by the VOC who was sent in 1687 to develop the area.<ref name=\"cikalbogor2\"/><ref name=\"depok2\"/><ref name=\"theyo\"/> It was seriously damaged by the eruption on 4\u20135 January 1699 of the [[Mount Salak]] volcano ({{lang-id|Gunung Salak}}).

During the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial era]], it was named '''''Buitenzorg''''' (meaning ''\"Without worries\"'' in Dutch) and served as the summer residence of the [[Governor-General]] of [[Dutch East Indies]].\n\nWith several hundred thousand people living on an area of about {{convert|20|km2|abbr=on}}, the central part of Bogor is one of the world's most densely populated areas. The city has a [[Istana Bogor|presidential palace]] and a [[Bogor Botanical Garden|botanical garden]] ({{lang-id|Kebun Raya Bogor}}) \u2013 one of the oldest and largest in the world. It bears the nickname \"the Rain City\" (''Kota Hujan''), because of frequent rain showers.

It was named [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], that in old Sundanese means \"a place between the parallel [rivers]\", and became the predecessor of the modern Bogor.<ref name=\"Pasundan\"/><ref name=\"cikalbogor\"/>\n\n[[File:Prasasti tugu.jpg|thumb|A 1600-year-old stone inscription (''prasasti'') of the [[Tarumanagara]] kingdom era.]]\n\nOver the next several centuries, Pakuan Pajajaran become one of the largest cities in medieval Indonesia with population reaching 48,000.<ref name=\"cikalbogor\"/> The name Pajajaran was then used for the entire kingdom, and the capital was simply called Pakuan.<ref name=\"cikalbogor\"/><ref name = \"sunda\"/><ref name=\"cikalbogor2\"/><ref name=\"Koler\"/><ref name=\"Karta\"/> The chronicles of that time were written in [[Sanskrit]], which was the language used for official and religious purposes, using the [[Pallava]] writing system, on rock stellas called prasasti.<ref name=\"History\"/><ref name=\"prasasti\"/> The prasasti found in and around Bogor differ in shape and text style from other Indonesian prasasti and are among the main attractions of the city.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the 9\u201315th centuries, the capital was moving between Pakuan and other cities of the kingdom, and finally returned to Pakuan by [[King Siliwangi]] (''[[Sri Baduga Maharaja]]'') on 3 June 1482 \u2013 the day of his coronation. Since 1973, this date is celebrated in Bogor as an official city holiday.<ref name=\"o144\"/><ref name = \"depok\"/>\n\nIn 1579, Pakuan was captured and almost completely destroyed by the army of [[Sultanate of Banten]],<ref name=\"VI\"/><ref name=\"Bolshaya Soviet entsiklopediya2\"/> ceasing the existence of the State of Sunda.

The formal transition occurred on 17 April 1684 by signing an agreement between the Crown Prince of Banten and the VOC.<ref name=\"depok2\"/>\n\nThe first, and temporal, colonial settlement at Pakuan was a camp of lieutenant Tanoejiwa, a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] employed by the VOC who was sent in 1687 to develop the area.<ref name=\"cikalbogor2\"/><ref name=\"depok2\"/><ref name=\"theyo\"/> It was seriously damaged by the eruption on 4\u20135 January 1699 of the [[Mount Salak]] volcano ({{lang-id|Gunung Salak}}).  However, the concomitant forest fires removed much forest, leaving much area for the planned rice and coffee plantations.<ref name=\"cikalbogor2\"/> In a short time, several agricultural settlements appeared around Pakuan, the largest being Kampung Baru (lit. \"new village\").<ref name=\"History\"/>\nIn 1701, they were combined into an administrative district; Tanoejiwa was chosen as the head of the district and is regarded as the founder of the modern [[Bogor Regency]].<ref name = \"depok2\"/><ref name=\"theyo\"/>\n\nThe district was further developed during the 1703 Dutch mission headed by the Inspector General of the VOC [[Abraham van Riebeeck]] (the son of the founder of [[Cape Town]] [[Jan van Riebeeck]] and later Governor of Dutch East Indies).<ref name=\"cikalbogor2\"/><ref name=\"depok2\"/> The expedition of van Riebeeck performed a detailed study of the Pakuan ruins, discovered and described many archaeological artifacts, including prasasti, and erected buildings for the VOC employees.<ref name = \"theyo\"/> The area attracted the Dutch by a favorable geographical position and mild climate, preferred over the hot [[Jakarta|Batavia]] which was then the administrative center of the Dutch East Indies.<ref name = \"theyo\"/> In 1744\u20131745, the residence of the Governor-General was built in Pakuan which was hosting the government during the summer.<ref name=\"theyo\"/>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Olieverfschildering voorstellend de grote postweg bij Buitenzorg TMnr 1012-1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Great Post Road]] passing Buitenzorg in the 19th century]]\nIn 1746, by the order of the Governor-General [[Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff]], the Palace, a nearby Dutch settlement and nine native settlements were merged into an administrative division named Buitenzorg (Dutch for \"beyond (or outside) concerns,\" meaning \"without worries\" or \"carefree,\" cf.

Other scientific institutions including a city library, natural science museum, biology, chemistry, and veterinary medicine laboratories were also constructed during this period. By the end of the 19th century, Buitenzorg became one of the most developed and Westernized cities in Indonesia.<ref name=\"cikalbogor2\"/><ref name=\"theyo\"/>\n\nIn 1904, Buitenzorg formally became the administrative center of the Dutch East Indies.

In February 1948, Buitenzorg was included in the quasi-independent state of West Java,({{lang-id|Negara Jawa Barat}}) which was renamed [[Pasundan]] in April 1948 ({{lang-id|Negara Pasundan}}). This state was established by the Netherlands as a step to transform their former colonial possessions in the East Indies into a dependent federation.<ref name=\"Pasundan...\"/><ref name=\"VI12\"/> In December 1949, Pasundan joined the [[Republic of the United States of Indonesia]] ({{lang-id|Republik Indonesia Serikat}}, RIS) established at the [[Dutch\u2013Indonesian Round Table Conference]] of 23 August{{snd}}2 November 1949.<ref name=\"VI12\"/><ref name=\"II\"/> In February 1950, as a result of defeat of Pasundan in a quick military conflict with the Republic of Indonesia, the city became part of Indonesia, as formalized in August 1950,<ref name=\"VI12\"/><ref name=\"II\"/> and its name was officially declared as Bogor.<ref name=\"o144\"/><ref name=\"UU16-50\"/>\n\n===As part of Indonesia===\nAs part of independent Indonesia, Bogor has a significant role in the cultural, scientific and economic development of the country and West Java in particular \u2013 in part due to the legacy of infrastructure built during the colonial period.
