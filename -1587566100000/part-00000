He is a recipient of multiple [[Grammy Award]]s, [[Ivor Novello Awards]] and other music industry awards.\n\n==Early life==\n\nOrbit (Wainwright) was raised in [[Shoreditch]], in [[East London]].<ref name=\"ContempMusicians\"/> His parents were both schoolteachers; he was the older of two sons.<ref name=\"ContempMusicians\"/> Despite his parents' objections, he left school at the age of 16, and subsisted for a number of years in various low-paying jobs, while seeking an outlet for his creativity.<ref name=\"ContempMusicians\"/><ref name=\"ContempMusicians\"/> Around this time, while rooming with a friend who was trying to start a recording studio, Orbit found his musical calling.<ref name=\"ContempMusicians\"/>\n\n==Torch Song==\n\nIn 1980 Orbit teamed up with [[Laurie Mayer (composer)|Laurie Mayer]] and Grant Gilbert to form the electronic/synth group Torch Song. They initially self-released recordings in an audio cassette series, generated from their home-built studio in a disused school in [[Notting Hill Gate]], in London, alongside the Grand Union Canal. [[Neville Brody]], the graphic designer, joined the band for a period. Orbit and Mayer were also visual artists and created a series of art magazines called ''The Ralph Hoover Guide'' in which he drew surrealist cartoons. The issues were sold at various London galleries and at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in The Mall. Richard Law, who was the A&R for IRS Records, was a follower of their music and aesthetic, and took it to industry mogul [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]], who had discovered and managed [[the Police]] and [[the Bangles]] in 1981. When Copeland signed them to the label the deal enabled them to build their ideal studio.  There they recorded two albums and four singles,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/10950-Torch-Song|title=Torch Song|website=Discogs|access-date=2016-09-12}}</ref> the most successful being the dance chart hit \"Prepare to Energize\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Torch-Song-Prepare-To-Energize/master/131686|title=Torch Song - Prepare To Energize|website=Discogs|access-date=2016-09-12}}</ref> which was featured in the film ''[[Bachelor Party (1984 film)|Bachelor Party]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086927/soundtrack \"Bachelor Party (1984) Soundtracks\"].

When working with [[Beck (musician)|Beck]], the two of them wrote a song for Pink, \"[[Feel Good Time]],\" which Orbit then produced for the soundtrack for the 2000 film ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]''.\n\nHe produced the album ''[[13 (Blur album)|13]]'' by Britpop group [[Blur (band)|Blur]], in London and [[Reykjav\u00edk]], [[Iceland]].\n\nOrbit had created remixes for Madonna previously such as \"[[Justify My Love]]\" and \"[[Erotica (song)|Erotica]]\" but he didn't meet her personally until 1997. That summer and autumn they wrote together and produced her multi-Grammy/award-winning seventh album ''[[Ray of Light]]''. The album took four months to record and it was the longest she ever spent recording an album. It was released on 22 February 1998.\n\nIn 2000, Orbit continued his songwriting for Madonna's 2000 album ''[[Music (Madonna album)|Music]]'' recorded at The Hit Factory in New York and also co-wrote and performed the song \"[[Beautiful Stranger]]\".\nThe two joined up again for her 2012 album ''[[MDNA (album)|MDNA]]'', co-writing and producing six of the tracks on the album. \"[[Masterpiece (Madonna song)|Masterpiece]]\" won a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Original Song in the  Miramax movie \"W.E.\", at the 69th Golden Globe Awards.\n\n==Classical work==\nInspired and encouraged by Rob Dickins, his first commercial release in this genre was ''[[Pieces in a Modern Style]]''. It was originally released in May 1995 on Orbit\u2019s N-Gram Recordings label, and then again in 2000 by Warner Music in the UK and Europe, and on Maverick in the U.S. The album reached No 2 in the UK album charts. The first single release from the album was \u2018Barber\u2019s [[Adagio for Strings]]\u2019, and a dance remix of the track by Dutch DJ [[Ferry Corsten]] was hugely successful. The single reached number 4<ref name=\"chartstats\"/><ref>UK Official Singles Charts [http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19991212/7501/ \"Official Singles Chart Top 100, 12th Dec 1999\"], ''[http://www.officialcharts.com/]''</ref> in the national singles chart.

He is a recipient of multiple [[Grammy Award]]s, [[Ivor Novello Awards]] and other music industry awards.\n\n==Early life==\n\nOrbit (Wainwright) was raised in [[Shoreditch]], in [[East London]].<ref name=\"ContempMusicians\"/> His parents were both schoolteachers; he was the older of two sons.<ref name=\"ContempMusicians\"/> Despite his parents' objections, he left school at the age of 16, and subsisted for a number of years in various low-paying jobs, while seeking an outlet for his creativity.<ref name=\"ContempMusicians\"/><ref name=\"ContempMusicians\"/> Around this time, while rooming with a friend who was trying to start a recording studio, Orbit found his musical calling.<ref name=\"ContempMusicians\"/>\n\n==Torch Song==\n\nIn 1980 Orbit teamed up with [[Laurie Mayer (composer)|Laurie Mayer]] and Grant Gilbert to form the electronic/synth group Torch Song. They initially self-released recordings in an audio cassette series, generated from their home-built studio in a disused school in [[Notting Hill Gate]], in London, alongside the Grand Union Canal. [[Neville Brody]], the graphic designer, joined the band for a period. Orbit and Mayer were also visual artists and created a series of art magazines called ''The Ralph Hoover Guide'' in which he drew surrealist cartoons. The issues were sold at various London galleries and at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in The Mall. Richard Law, who was the A&R for IRS Records, was a follower of their music and aesthetic, and took it to industry mogul [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]], who had discovered and managed [[the Police]] and [[the Bangles]] in 1981. When Copeland signed them to the label the deal enabled them to build their ideal studio.  There they recorded two albums and four singles,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/10950-Torch-Song|title=Torch Song|website=Discogs|access-date=2016-09-12}}</ref> the most successful being the dance chart hit \"Prepare to Energize\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Torch-Song-Prepare-To-Energize/master/131686|title=Torch Song - Prepare To Energize|website=Discogs|access-date=2016-09-12}}</ref> which was featured in the film \u2018Bachelor Party\u2019.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086927/soundtrack \"Bachelor Party (1984) Soundtracks\"].

When working with [[Beck (musician)|Beck]], the two of them wrote a song for Pink, \"[[Feel Good Time]],\" which Orbit then produced for the soundtrack for the 2000 film ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]''.\n\nHe produced the album ''[[13 (Blur album)|13]]'' by Britpop group [[Blur (band)|Blur]], in London and [[Reykjav\u00edk]], [[Iceland]].\n\nOrbit had created remixes for Madonna previously such as \"[[Justify My Love]]\" and \"[[Erotica (song)|Erotica]]\" but he didn't meet her personally until 1997. That summer and autumn they wrote together and produced her multi-Grammy/award-winning seventh album ''[[Ray of Light]]''. The album took four months to record and it was the longest she ever spent recording an album. It was released on 22 February 1998.\n\nIn 2000, Orbit continued his songwriting for Madonna's 2000 album ''[[Music (Madonna album)|Music]]'' recorded at The Hit Factory in New York and also co-wrote and performed the song \"[[Beautiful Stranger]]\".\nThe two joined up again for her 2012 album ''[[MDNA (album)|MDNA]]'', co-writing and producing six of the tracks on the album. \"[[Masterpiece (Madonna song)|Masterpiece]]\" won a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Original Song in the  Miramax movie \"W.E.\", at the 69th Golden Globe Awards.\n\n==Classical work==\nInspired and encouraged by Rob Dickins, his first commercial release in this genre was ''[[Pieces in a Modern Style]]''. It was originally released in May 1995 on Orbit\u2019s N-Gram Recordings label, and then again in 2000 by Warner Music in the UK and Europe, and on Maverick in the U.S. The album reached No 2 in the UK album charts. The first single release from the album was \u2018Barber\u2019s [[Adagio for Strings]]\u2019, and a dance remix of the track by Dutch DJ [[Ferry Corsten]] was hugely successful. The single reached number 4<ref name=\"chartstats\"/><ref>UK Official Singles Charts [http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19991212/7501/ \"Official Singles Chart Top 100, 12th Dec 1999\"], ''[http://www.officialcharts.com/]''</ref> in the national singles chart.

Barkun writes that conspiracies are \"actual covert plots planned and/or carried out by two or more persons\". A conspiracy theory, on the other hand, is \"an intellectual construct\", a \"template imposed upon the world to give the appearance of order to events\". Positing that \"some small and hidden group\" has manipulated events, a conspiracy theory can be local or international, focused on single events or covering multiple incidents and entire countries, regions and periods of history. Conspiracy theorists see themselves as having privileged access to special knowledge or a special mode of thought that separates them from the masses who believe the official account.<ref name=\"Barkun2016\">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/0392192116669288|title=Conspiracy Theories as Stigmatized Knowledge|journal=Diogenes|pages=039219211666928|year=2016|last1=Barkun|first1=Michael}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n{{See|List of conspiracy theories}}\nA conspiracy theory may take any matter as its subject, but certain subjects attract greater interest than others.

This refers to limited and well-defined events.  Examples may include such conspiracies theories as those concerning the [[Kennedy assassination conspiracies|Kennedy assassination]], [[9/11]], and the [[discredited AIDS origins theories|spread of AIDS]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n* ''Systemic conspiracy theories''.  The conspiracy is believed to have broad goals, usually conceived as securing control of a country, a region, or even the entire world. The goals are sweeping, whilst the conspiratorial machinery is generally simple: a single, evil organization implements a plan to infiltrate and subvert existing institutions. This is a common scenario in conspiracy theories that focus on the alleged machinations of [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Jews]], [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Freemasons]], [[Red Scare|Communism]], or the [[Vatican conspiracy theories|Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n* ''Superconspiracy theories''. For Barkun, such theories link multiple alleged conspiracies together hierarchically.  At the summit is a distant but all-powerful evil force.  His cited examples are the ideas of [[David Icke]] and [[Milton William Cooper]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n\n=== Rothbard: shallow vs. deep ===\n[[Murray Rothbard]] argues in favor of a model that contrasts \"deep\" conspiracy theories to \"shallow\" ones. According to Rothbard, a \"shallow\" theorist observes an event and asks ''[[Cui bono]]''? (\"Who benefits?\"), jumping to the conclusion that a posited beneficiary is responsible for covertly influencing events.  On the other hand, the \"deep\" conspiracy theorist begins with a hunch and then seeks out evidence. Rothbard describes this latter activity as a matter of confirming with certain facts one's initial paranoia.<ref>As quoted by B.K. Marcus in \"[https://mises.org/journals/jls/20_2/20_2_2.pdf Radio Free Rothbard],\" ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Vol 20, No 2. (SPRING 2006): pp 17\u201351.

A fundamental paradox of the paranoid style is the imitation of the enemy. The enemy, for example, may be the cosmopolitan intellectual, but the paranoid will outdo him in the apparatus of scholarship, even of pedantry.&nbsp;...&nbsp;The Ku Klux Klan imitated Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments, developing an elaborate ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy.

Spokesmen of the various fundamentalist anti-Communist \"crusades\" openly express their admiration for the dedication, discipline, and strategic ingenuity the Communist cause calls forth.<ref name=\"harpers=1964\"/>}}\n\nHofstadter also noted that \"sexual freedom\" is a vice frequently attributed to the conspiracist's target group, noting that \"very often the fantasies of true believers reveal strong sadomasochistic outlets, vividly expressed, for example, in the delight of anti-Masons with the cruelty of Masonic punishments.\"<ref name=\"harpers=1964\">{{cite book|author=Hofstadter, Richard|author-link=Richard Hofstadter|year=1965|title=The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A.

Barkun writes that conspiracies are \"actual covert plots planned and/or carried out by two or more persons\". A conspiracy theory, on the other hand, is \"an intellectual construct\", a \"template imposed upon the world to give the appearance of order to events\". Positing that \"some small and hidden group\" has manipulated events, a conspiracy theory can be local or international, focused on single events or covering multiple incidents and entire countries, regions and periods of history. Conspiracy theorists see themselves as having privileged access to special knowledge or a special mode of thought that separates them from the masses who believe the official account.<ref name=\"Barkun2016\">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/0392192116669288|title=Conspiracy Theories as Stigmatized Knowledge|journal=Diogenes|pages=039219211666928|year=2016|last1=Barkun|first1=Michael}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n{{See|List of conspiracy theories}}\nA conspiracy theory may take any matter as its subject, but certain subjects attract greater interest than others.

This refers to limited and well-defined events.  Examples may include such conspiracies theories as those concerning the [[Kennedy assassination conspiracies|Kennedy assassination]], [[9/11]], and the [[discredited AIDS origins theories|spread of AIDS]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n* ''Systemic conspiracy theories''.  The conspiracy is believed to have broad goals, usually conceived as securing control of a country, a region, or even the entire world. The goals are sweeping, whilst the conspiratorial machinery is generally simple: a single, evil organization implements a plan to infiltrate and subvert existing institutions. This is a common scenario in conspiracy theories that focus on the alleged machinations of [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Jews]], [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Freemasons]], [[Red Scare|Communism]], or the [[Vatican conspiracy theories|Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n* ''Superconspiracy theories''. For Barkun, such theories link multiple alleged conspiracies together hierarchically.  At the summit is a distant but all-powerful evil force.  His cited examples are the ideas of [[David Icke]] and [[Milton William Cooper]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}\n\n=== Rothbard: shallow vs. deep ===\n[[Murray Rothbard]] argues in favor of a model that contrasts \"deep\" conspiracy theories to \"shallow\" ones. According to Rothbard, a \"shallow\" theorist observes an event and asks ''[[Cui bono]]''? (\"Who benefits?\"), jumping to the conclusion that a posited beneficiary is responsible for covertly influencing events.  On the other hand, the \"deep\" conspiracy theorist begins with a hunch and then seeks out evidence. Rothbard describes this latter activity as a matter of confirming with certain facts one's initial paranoia.<ref>As quoted by B.K. Marcus in \"[https://mises.org/journals/jls/20_2/20_2_2.pdf Radio Free Rothbard],\" ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Vol 20, No 2. (SPRING 2006): pp 17\u201351.

This projection, according to the argument, is manifested in the form of attribution of undesirable characteristics of the self to the conspirators. Historian Richard Hofstadter stated that:\n\n{{quote|This enemy seems on many counts a projection of the self; both the ideal and the unacceptable aspects of the self are attributed to him. A fundamental paradox of the paranoid style is the imitation of the enemy. The enemy, for example, may be the cosmopolitan intellectual, but the paranoid will outdo him in the apparatus of scholarship, even of pedantry.&nbsp;...&nbsp;The Ku Klux Klan imitated Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments, developing an elaborate ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy. The [[John Birch Society]] emulates Communist cells and quasi-secret operation through \"front\" groups, and preaches a ruthless prosecution of the ideological war along lines very similar to those it finds in the Communist enemy. Spokesmen of the various fundamentalist anti-Communist \"crusades\" openly express their admiration for the dedication, discipline, and strategic ingenuity the Communist cause calls forth.<ref name=\"harpers=1964\"/>}}\n\nHofstadter also noted that \"sexual freedom\" is a vice frequently attributed to the conspiracist's target group, noting that \"very often the fantasies of true believers reveal strong sadomasochistic outlets, vividly expressed, for example, in the delight of anti-Masons with the cruelty of Masonic punishments.\"<ref name=\"harpers=1964\">{{cite book|author=Hofstadter, Richard|author-link=Richard Hofstadter|year=1965|title=The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A.

While the complete facts of the situation and correct methodology are ostensibly important to them, Latour proposes that the scientific process is instead laid on as a patina to one's pet theories to lend a sort of reputation high ground. The \"fact position\" argues that individuals are dominated, often covertly and without their awareness, by external forces (e.g., economics, gender).{{r|critiquesteam|page2=238}} Latour concludes that each of these two approaches in Academia has led to a polarized, inefficient atmosphere highlighted (in both approaches) by its causticness. \"Do you see now why it feels so good to be a critical mind?\" asks Latour: no matter which position you take, \"You're always right!\"{{r|critiquesteam|page3=238\u201339}}\n\nLatour notes that such social criticism has been appropriated by those he describes as conspiracy theorists, including [[climate change denial]]ists and the [[9/11 Truth movement]]: \"Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously, but I am worried to detect, in those mad mixtures of knee-jerk disbelief, punctilious demands for proofs, and free use of powerful explanation from the social neverland, many of the weapons of social critique.\"{{r|critiquesteam|page4=230}}\n\n===Fusion paranoia===\n[[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]], a ''[[Washington Post]]'' journalist and critic of [[anti-war]] movements on both the left and right, coined the term \"fusion paranoia\" to refer to a political convergence of left-wing and right-wing activists around anti-war issues and [[civil liberties]], which he said were motivated by a shared belief in conspiracism or shared [[Anti-statism|anti-government]] views.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/06/19/the-road-to-paranoia|title=THE ROAD TO PARANOIA|last=Kelly|first=Michael|date=12 June 1995|work=The New Yorker|access-date=9 April 2018|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>\n\nBarkun has adopted this term to refer to how the synthesis of paranoid conspiracy theories, which were once limited to American fringe audiences, has given them mass appeal and enabled them to become commonplace in [[mass media]],{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=230}} thereby inaugurating an unrivaled period of people actively preparing for [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] or [[millenarianism|millenarian]] scenarios in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|pp=207, 210, 211}} Barkun notes the occurrence of lone-wolf conflicts with law enforcement acting as proxy for threatening the established political powers.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|pp=193, 197}}\n\n==Viability of conspiracies==\nThe physicist [[David Robert Grimes]] estimated the time it would take for a conspiracy to be exposed based on the number of people involved.<ref name=\"pbs_plos_one\">{{cite web|last1=Barajas|first1=Joshua|title=How many people does it take to keep a conspiracy alive?|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/math-formula-charts-the-lifespan-of-hoaxes/|website=PBS NEWSHOUR|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)|accessdate=22 July 2016|date=15 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Grimes_PLOS_ONE\">{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=David R|authorlink1=David Robert Grimes|title=On the Viability of Conspiratorial Beliefs|journal=PLOS ONE|date=26 January 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905|pmid=26812482|volume=11|issue=1|pmc=4728076|pages=e0147905|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1147905G}}</ref> His calculations used data from the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM surveillance program]], the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]], and the [[FBI Laboratory#Controversy|FBI forensic scandal]].
