RuPaul announces the first mini-challenge is to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall, akin to Season 7's first mini-challenge.\n\nFor the main challenge, the seven queens are tasked to write lyrics and provide choreography to the track, \"I'm That Bitch\". Tensions erupt between Brita, Heidi, Jackie, and Widow regarding choreography, resulting in Heidi taking charge of choreography. The queens are able to perform the routine in front of guest judge, Nicki Minaj. The runway category for the episode is \"Sparkles\".\n\nOn the main stage, four girls (Gigi Goode, Widow Von'Du, Brita, and Jackie Cox) are given high praises, despite critiques on Brita's verse not showing much of her personality and Jackie's makeup not being able to hide her beard. Crystal Methyd is given mixed reviews on her runways but praise for her verse. Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques, with the latter coming off as nervous during the performance despite the judges loving her runways and the former selling her performance but faltering on her looks. After the judges deliberate, Brita, Jackie Cox, Crystal Methyd, Nicky Doll, and Heidi N Closet are all declared safe, leaving Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du to be declared as the top two of the episode. They lipsync to \"[[Starships (song)|Starships]]\" by [[Nicki Minaj]]; Widow Von'Du wins the lipsync, earning the first win of the season. \n\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Nicki Minaj]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original rap verse to \"I'm That Bitch\" and choreograph a routine to be performed live on the main stage.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Sparkles\n*'''Top Two''': Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Widow Von'Du</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Starships (song)|Starships]]\" by [[Nicki Minaj]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =147\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|2}}2\n |Title           = You Don't Know Me\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|06}}\n |ShortSummary    = At the beginning of the episode, the remaining six contestants are introduced: Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, Sherry Pie, Jan, Jaida Essence Hall and Aiden Zhane. For the mini challenge, each queen needs to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall.\n\nFor the maxi challenge, the queens are asked to perform in an introductory musical number inspired by [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]. The theme for the runway is tulle. \n\nDuring critiques, the queens receive mostly glowing critiques, especially Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie, albeit Rock M. Sakura receiving a mild negative critique about using fart humor and mixed reviews regarding her runway. Dahlia Sin receives negative feedback and is called out for letting her nerves get to her and for not fully showing who she truly is. After deliberations, Jan, Aiden Zhane, Rock M. Sakura, and Dahlia Sin are all declared safe, leaving Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie as the top two of the episode. After they lipsync to \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]; Jaida Essence Hall is declared the winner of the challenge.\n\nAfter the episode, the six queens meet the first seven girls of the season.\n\n*'''Guest Judges:''' [[Robyn]] and [[Thandie Newton]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]-inspired jazz number.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Tulle\n*'''Top Two''': Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Jaida Essence Hall</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =148\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|3}}3\n |Title           = World's Worst\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|13}}\n |ShortSummary    = The episode begins with the first seven queens meeting the last six queens in the werkroom. They kiki over what transpired during their respective weeks, resulting in the second group revealing that there have been spats between them, particularly between Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie. The first group conceals the earlier argument between Jackie Cox, Brita, Widow Von'Du, and Heidi N Closet as a sort of unity tactic against the second group.\n\nThe mini-challenge is for the two past challenge winners, Widow and Jaida, to rank their competition from their opposite weeks between \"TOPS\" (their fiercest competition) to \"BOTTOMS\" (their least intimidating competition), resulting in Widow, Jaida, Heidi, and Aiden Zhane as the team captains of the week. \n\nThe main challenge of the week is an improv challenge where the queens are grouped into fours for a talent competition called \"''World's Worst''\". The queens are grouped as follows: (1) Aiden Zhane, Sherry Pie, and Brita; (2) Heidi N Closet, Gigi Goode, and Jackie Cox; (3) Widow Von'Du, Nicky Doll, and Crystal Methyd; and (4) Jaida Essence Hall, Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, and Jan. On the runway, the category is Buttons and Bows.\n\nAfter the runway presentations are complete, Aiden Zhane, Brita, Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, Jan, Rock M. Sakura, and Widow Von'Du are all declared safe. Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, and Sherry Pie are given positive critiques for both their performances and runways, and Heidi is commended for stepping up her game as team captain. Meanwhile, Crystal Methyd, Dahlia Sin, and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques for their performances in the challenge, while Nicky receives high accolades for her runway with both Crystal and Dahlia garnering mixed reviews. Ultimately, Sherry Pie is declared the winner of the challenge, while Nicky Doll and Dahlia Sin are declared the bottom two and duel to a lipsync to [[Ariana Grande]] and [[Iggy Azalea]]'s \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\"; Nicky wins the lip sync, eliminating Dahlia who hastily leaves the stage.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Olivia Munn]]\n*'''Alternating Judges:''' [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Queer-Peer Assessment\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Improv in a talent competition, called \"World's Worst\"\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Buttons and Bows\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/drag-race-sherry-pie-disqualification-win.html|title=Here\u2019s How RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Is Dealing With Its Sherry Pie Problem|date=March 13, 2020|first=Rebecca|last=Alter|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Bottom Two''': Dahlia Sin and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\" by [[Ariana Grande]] ft.

Gigi Goode is declared the winner and RuPaul announces that this weeks maxi challenge is a ball-themed ball (known as The Ball Ball) where the queens need to participate in three categories: Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza. The queens must make the final look from scratch having already brought looks for the other two categories. As the queens are preparing, Nicky Doll expresses her bewilderment with not being able to bring her silly side to the runway and feeling so reserved in front of the judges, despite being freely goofy and comedic in the werkroom, and vows to change that, while Rock M. Sakura tells the others about how her makeup style, resemblant of [[Kim Chi (drag queen)|Kim Chi]] and [[Trixie Mattel]], originated from racist remarks against her supposed work-ethic as a drag queen. Tensions rise when Aiden Zhane proceeds to take a nap after she finishes her final runway look far ahead of everyone else, irritating the other queens as they feel she isn't working as hard as them to push and elevate their drag in order to win the competition.\n\nOn the main stage, the girls present all of their outfits and Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll receive positive feedback from the judges on all their outfits, but Nicky is once again critiqued for presenting herself too stiff onstage and is encouraged to continue to let go and do weird things. Meanwhile, Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Rock M. Sakura are negatively critiqued by the judges. Aiden is told her Lady Baller runway is a \"home run\" but is heavily clocked by Michelle for doing nothing more than gluing balls to a corset for her Eleganza look and her last two looks being far too simple. Rock M. meanwhile is praised for her creativity but is critiqued for doing too much particularly on her Eleganza runway and not editing her aesthetic, and Brita receives overall mediocre feedback, particularly for her Balls to the Wall creation. After the judges deliberate, Gigi Goode is announced as the winner of the challenge, while Brita and Rock M. Sakura face off in a lip sync to \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\" by [[Rihanna]]. Brita is the winner of the lip sync and Rock M. is eliminated from the competition.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' \"The Beehive Jive\" dance competition\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' A $2,500 cash tip\n*'''Main Challenge:'''  Create three looks based on Sports Balls; Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip \n*'''Bottom Two''': Brita and Rock M.

Sakura's elimination, with Jackie Cox and Brita emotional over Rock M.'s departure. The queens sit on the couch, discussing Gigi Goode's win, and Nicky Doll's constant criticism from the judges for being unable to show a lighthearted, comedic side of her. Aiden Zhane discusses her performance in last week's ball, defending her looks while Jaida Essence Hall admonishes Aiden for making excuses, saying that she should have been in the bottom two. The queens disperse, with Heidi N Closet and Widow Von'Du discussing Aiden's overall performance in the competition.\n\nThe next morning, the queens enter the workroom and RuPaul informs the queens that they will be acting in a ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' parody titled \"''Gay's Anatomy''\". The queens randomly select pills to decide which two queens will get to assign roles, and Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll choose the winning pills. The queens discuss which parts they want, and most of the queens end up getting the roles they requested. However, Aiden Zhane and Widow Von'Du receive different roles to their dismay. [[Carson Kressley]] directs the skit, and critiques Jaida Essence Hall for not being able to deliver her lines, Brita for inconsistent acting, and Nicky for being low energy. He gives praise to Gigi for her acting, Widow for incorporating improv into her performance, and to Aiden for following his direction. \n\nOn the main stage, with [[Normani]] as a guest judge, the queens walk the runway wearing capes. The queens see the final cut of ''Gay's Anatomy''. Aiden Zhane, Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are the best of the week, with Sherry Pie being the winner, while Brita, Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll were overshadowed. Crystal receives positive critiques for her runway and performance and is the first to be deemed safe. Jaida receives lukewarm reception for her performance, but is praised for her runway and is declared safe. Brita receives mixed reviews for her performance and is the last queen to be deemed safe. This leaves Nicky and Heidi in the bottom, as they both receive negative reviews on their runway looks and for their performance in ''Gay's Anatomy''. The two queens lipsync to \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]], Heidi N Closet is the winner, and Nicky Doll sashays away.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Normani]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Pink Pill or Silver Pill\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winners:''' Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' Assigning the roles for the main challenge\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Overact in ''Gay's Anatomy'', a parody of the popular TV show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which focuses on a group of young doctors that work in a hospital.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Planet of the Capes\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''\n*'''Bottom Two''': Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' Nicky Doll</span>\n*'''Farewell message''': ''\"I may not have gotten a crown.

Brita rehashes the drama between her and Aiden, with Aiden exhausted over Brita's attitude.\n\nFor the main challenge, RuPaul announces that the queens will be participating in the Snatch Game. He brings in [[Vanessa Vanjie Mateo]] to give tips on what to do and what not to do during Snatch Game. The Snatch Game characters are as followed:<br>\nAiden Zhane as [[Patricia Quinn]];<br>\nBrita as [[Jennifer Holliday]];<br>\nCrystal Methyd as [[Poppy (entertainer)|Poppy]];<br>\nGigi Goode as \"[[Sophia (robot)|Maria the Robot]]\";<br>\nHeidi N Closet as [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]];<br>\nJackie Cox as [[Lisa Rinna]];<br>\nJan as [[Bernadette Peters]];<br>\nJaida Essence Hall as [[Cardi B]];<br>\nSherry Pie as [[Katharine Hepburn]];<br>\nWidow Von'Du as [[Tina Turner]] and [[Ike Turner]].<br>\n\nFor the runway, the category is Frozen Eleganza, inspired by the [[Frozen (musical)|Broadway musical of the same name]].

RuPaul announces the first mini-challenge is to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall, akin to Season 7's first mini-challenge.\n\nFor the main challenge, the seven queens are tasked to write lyrics and provide choreography to the track, \"I'm That Bitch\". Tensions erupt between Brita, Heidi, Jackie, and Widow regarding choreography, resulting in Heidi taking charge of choreography. The queens are able to perform the routine in front of guest judge, Nicki Minaj. The runway category for the episode is \"Sparkles\".\n\nOn the main stage, four girls (Gigi Goode, Widow Von'Du, Brita, and Jackie Cox) are given high praises, despite critiques on Brita's verse not showing much of her personality and Jackie's makeup not being able to hide her beard. Crystal Methyd is given mixed reviews on her runways but praise for her verse. Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques, with the latter coming off as nervous during the performance despite the judges loving her runways and the former selling her performance but faltering on her looks. After the judges deliberate, Brita, Jackie Cox, Crystal Methyd, Nicky Doll, and Heidi N Closet are all declared safe, leaving Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du to be declared as the top two of the episode. They lipsync to \"[[Starships (song)|Starships]]\" by [[Nicki Minaj]]; Widow Von'Du wins the lipsync, earning the first win of the season and an additional cash tip of $5,000. \n\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Nicki Minaj]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original rap verse to \"I'm That Bitch\" and choreograph a routine to be performed live on the main stage.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Sparkles\n*'''Top Two''': Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Widow Von'Du</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Starships (song)|Starships]]\" by [[Nicki Minaj]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =147\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|2}}2\n |Title           = You Don't Know Me\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|06}}\n |ShortSummary    = At the beginning of the episode, the remaining six contestants are introduced: Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, Sherry Pie, Jan, Jaida Essence Hall and Aiden Zhane. For the mini challenge, each queen needs to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall.\n\nFor the maxi challenge, the queens are asked to perform in an introductory musical number inspired by [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]. The theme for the runway is tulle. \n\nDuring critiques, the queens receive mostly glowing critiques, especially Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie, albeit Rock M. Sakura receiving a mild negative critique about using fart humor and mixed reviews regarding her runway. Dahlia Sin receives negative feedback and is called out for letting her nerves get to her and for not fully showing who she truly is. After deliberations, Jan, Aiden Zhane, Rock M. Sakura, and Dahlia Sin are all declared safe, leaving Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie as the top two of the episode. After they lipsync to \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]; Jaida Essence Hall is declared the winner of the challenge.\n\nAfter the episode, the six queens meet the first seven girls of the season.\n\n*'''Guest Judges:''' [[Robyn]] and [[Thandie Newton]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]-inspired jazz number.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Tulle\n*'''Top Two''': Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Jaida Essence Hall</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =148\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|3}}3\n |Title           = World's Worst\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|13}}\n |ShortSummary    = The episode begins with the first seven queens meeting the last six queens in the werkroom. They kiki over what transpired during their respective weeks, resulting in the second group revealing that there have been spats between them, particularly between Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie. The first group conceals the earlier argument between Jackie Cox, Brita, Widow Von'Du, and Heidi N Closet as a sort of unity tactic against the second group.\n\nThe mini-challenge is for the two past challenge winners, Widow and Jaida, to rank their competition from their opposite weeks between \"TOPS\" (their fiercest competition) to \"BOTTOMS\" (their least intimidating competition), resulting in Widow, Jaida, Heidi, and Aiden Zhane as the team captains of the week. \n\nThe main challenge of the week is an improv challenge where the queens are grouped into fours for a talent competition called \"''World's Worst''\". The queens are grouped as follows: (1) Aiden Zhane, Sherry Pie, and Brita; (2) Heidi N Closet, Gigi Goode, and Jackie Cox; (3) Widow Von'Du, Nicky Doll, and Crystal Methyd; and (4) Jaida Essence Hall, Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, and Jan. On the runway, the category is Buttons and Bows.\n\nAfter the runway presentations are complete, Aiden Zhane, Brita, Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, Jan, Rock M. Sakura, and Widow Von'Du are all declared safe. Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, and Sherry Pie are given positive critiques for both their performances and runways, and Heidi is commended for stepping up her game as team captain. Meanwhile, Crystal Methyd, Dahlia Sin, and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques for their performances in the challenge, while Nicky receives high accolades for her runway with both Crystal and Dahlia garnering mixed reviews. Ultimately, Sherry Pie is declared the winner of the challenge, while Nicky Doll and Dahlia Sin are declared the bottom two and duel to a lipsync to [[Ariana Grande]] and [[Iggy Azalea]]'s \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\"; Nicky wins the lip sync, eliminating Dahlia who hastily leaves the stage.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Olivia Munn]]\n*'''Alternating Judges:''' [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Queer-Peer Assessment\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Improv in a talent competition, called \"World's Worst\"\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Buttons and Bows\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/drag-race-sherry-pie-disqualification-win.html|title=Here\u2019s How RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Is Dealing With Its Sherry Pie Problem|date=March 13, 2020|first=Rebecca|last=Alter|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Bottom Two''': Dahlia Sin and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\" by [[Ariana Grande]] ft.

Gigi Goode is declared the winner and Ru announces that this weeks maxi challenge is a ball-themed ball (known as The Ball Ball) where the queens need to participate in three categories: Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza. The queens must make the final look from scratch having already brought looks for the other two categories. As the queens are preparing, Nicky Doll expresses her bewilderment with not being able to bring her silly side to the runway and feeling so reserved in front of the judges, despite being freely goofy and comedic in the werkroom, and vows to change that, while Rock M. Sakura tells the others about how her makeup style, resemblant of [[Kim Chi (drag queen)|Kim Chi]] and [[Trixie Mattel]], originated from racist remarks against her supposed work-ethic as a drag queen. Tensions rise when Aiden Zhane proceeds to take a nap after she finishes her final runway look far ahead of everyone else, irritating the other queens as they feel she isn't working as hard as them to push and elevate their drag in order to win the competition.\n\nOn the main stage, the girls present all of their outfits and Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll receive positive feedback from the judges on all their outfits, but Nicky is once again critiqued for presenting herself too stiff onstage and is encouraged to continue to let go and do weird things. Meanwhile, Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Rock M. Sakura are negatively critiqued by the judges. Aiden is told her Lady Baller runway is a \"home run\" but is heavily clocked by Michelle for doing nothing more than gluing balls to a corset for her Eleganza look and her last two looks being far too simple. Rock M. meanwhile is praised for her creativity but is critiqued for doing too much particularly on her Eleganza runway and not editing her aesthetic, and Brita receives overall mediocre feedback, particularly for her Balls to the Wall creation. After the judges deliberate, Gigi Goode is announced as the winner of the challenge, while Brita and Rock M. Sakura face off in a lip sync to \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\" by [[Rihanna]]. Brita is the winner of the lip sync and Rock M. is eliminated from the competition.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' \"The Beehive Jive\" dance competition\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' A $2,500 cash tip\n*'''Main Challenge:'''  Create three looks based on Sports Balls; Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip \n*'''Bottom Two''': Brita and Rock M.

Sakura's elimination, with Jackie Cox and Brita emotional over Rock M.'s departure. The queens sit on the couch, discussing Gigi Goode's win, and Nicky Doll's constant criticism from the judges for being unable to show a lighthearted, comedic side of her. Aiden Zhane discusses her performance in last week's ball, defending her looks while Jaida Essence Hall admonishes Aiden for making excuses, saying that she should have been in the bottom two. The queens disperse, with Heidi N Closet and Widow Von'Du discussing Aiden's overall performance in the competition.\n\nThe next morning, the queens enter the workroom and RuPaul informs the queens that they will be acting in a ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' parody titled \"''Gay's Anatomy''\". The queens randomly select pills to decide which two queens will get to assign roles, and Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll choose the winning pills. The queens discuss which parts they want, and most of the queens end up getting the roles they requested. However, Aiden Zhane and Widow Von'Du receive different roles to their dismay. [[Carson Kressley]] directs the skit, and critiques Jaida Essence Hall for not being able to deliver her lines, Brita for inconsistent acting, and Nicky for being low energy. He gives praise to Gigi for her acting, Widow for incorporating improv into her performance, and to Aiden for following his direction. \n\nOn the main stage, with [[Normani]] as a guest judge, the queens walk the runway wearing capes. The queens see the final cut of ''Gay's Anatomy''. Aiden Zhane, Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are the best of the week, with Sherry Pie being the winner, while Brita, Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll were overshadowed. Crystal receives positive critiques for her runway and performance and is the first to be deemed safe. Jaida receives lukewarm reception for her performance, but is praised for her runway and is declared safe. Brita receives mixed reviews for her performance and is the last queen to be deemed safe. This leaves Nicky and Heidi in the bottom, as they both receive negative reviews on their runway looks and for their performance in ''Gay's Anatomy''. The two queens lipsync to \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]], Heidi N Closet is the winner, and Nicky Doll sashays away.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Normani]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Pink Pill or Silver Pill\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winners:''' Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' Assigning the roles for the main challenge\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Overact in ''Gay's Anatomy'', a parody of the popular TV show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which focuses on a group of young doctors that work in a hospital.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Planet of the Capes\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''\n*'''Bottom Two''': Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' Nicky Doll</span>\n*'''Farewell message''': ''\"I may not have gotten a crown.

Brita rehashes the drama between her and Aiden, with Aiden exhausted over Brita's attitude.\n\nFor the main challenge, Ru announces that the queens will be participating in the Snatch Game. He brings in [[Vanessa Vanjie Mateo]] to give tips on what to do (and what not to do, according the Mateo) during Snatch Game. The queens are impersonating the follow characters: Aiden Zhane as [[Patricia Quinn]], Brita as [[Jennifer Holliday]], Crystal Methyd as [[Poppy (entertainer)|Poppy]], Gigi Goode as \"[[Sophia (robot)|Maria the Robot]]\", Heidi N. Closet as [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]], Jackie Cox as [[Lisa Rinna]], Jan as [[Bernadette Peters]], Jaida Essence Hall as [[Cardi B]], Sherry Pie as [[Katharine Hepburn]], and Widow Von'Du as [[Tina Turner]] and [[Ike Turner]].

The [[apparent visual magnitude]] of NGC 5548 is approximately 13.3 in the [[UBV photometric system|V band]].<ref name=\"WisniewskiKleinmann1968\"/>\n\nIn 1943, this galaxy was one of twelve [[nebulae]] listed by American astronomer [[Carl Keenan Seyfert]] that showed broad [[emission line]]s in their [[Galactic nuclei|nuclei]].<ref name=\"Seyfert1943\"/> Members of this class of objects became known as [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert galaxies]], and they were noted to have a higher than normal surface brightness in their nuclei.<ref name=\"BurbidgePrendergast1963\"/> Observation of NGC 5548 during the 1960s with [[radio telescope]]s showed an enhanced level of [[Radio astronomy|radio emission]].<ref name=\"Tovmassian1966\"/> [[Spectrogram]]s of the nucleus made in 1966 showed that the energized region was confined to a volume a few [[parsec]]s across, where temperature were around {{val|14000|u=K}} and the plasma had a dispersion velocity of \u00b1450&nbsp;km/s.<ref name=\"DibaiEsipovPronik1968\"/>\n\nAmong astronomers, the accepted explanation for the active nucleus in NGC 5548 is the accretion of matter onto a [[supermassive black hole]] (SMBH) at the core. This object is surrounded by an orbiting disk of accreted matter drawn in from the surroundings. As material is drawn into the outer parts of this disk, it becomes [[Photoionization|photoionized]], producing broad emission lines in the optical and [[ultraviolet]] bands of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. A wind of ionized matter, organized in filamentary structures at distances of 1\u201314 light days from the center, is flowing outward in the direction perpendicular to the accretion disk plane.<ref name=\"AAA551_L6\"/>\n\nThe mass of the central black hole can be estimated based on the properties of the emission lines in the core region. Combined measurements yield an estimated mass of {{val|6.54|+0.26|-0.25|e=7|ul=M_solar}}. In other words, it is some 65 million times the mass of the [[Sun]]. This result is consistent with other methods of estimating the mass of the SMBH in the nucleus of NGC 5548.<ref name=\"AAA662_205\"/> Matter is falling onto this black hole at the estimated rate of {{val|0.03|u=M_solar}} per year, whereas mass is flowing outward from the core at or above the rate of {{val|0.92|u=M_solar}} each year.<ref name=\"Crenshaw2009\"/> The inner part of the accretion disk surrounding the SMBH forms a thick, hot [[Stellar corona|corona]] spanning several light hours that is emitting [[X-ray astronomy|X-rays]]. When this radiation reaches the [[optically thick]] part of the accretion disk at a radius of around 1\u20132 light days, the X-rays are converted into heat.<ref name=\"ApJ639_46\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=24em|refs=\n<ref name=\"ApJ131_1163\">{{Citation\n | last1     = Skrutskie\n | first1    = M.

The [[apparent visual magnitude]] of NGC 5548 is approximately 13.3 in the [[UBV photometric system|V band]].<ref name=\"WisniewskiKleinmann1968\"/>\n\nIn 1943, this galaxy was one of twelve [[nebulae]] listed by American astronomer [[Carl Keenan Seyfert]] that showed broad [[emission line]]s in their [[Galactic nuclei|nuclei]].<ref name=\"Seyfert1943\"/> Members of this class of objects became known as [[Seyfert galaxy|Seyfert galaxies]], and they were noted to have a higher than normal surface brightness in their nuclei.<ref name=\"BurbidgePrendergast1963\"/> Observation of NGC 5548 during the 1960s with [[radio telescope]]s showed an enhanced level of [[Radio astronomy|radio emission]].<ref name=\"Tovmassian1966\"/> [[Spectrogram]]s of the nucleus made in 1966 showed that the energized region was confined to a volume a few [[parsec]]s across, where temperature were around {{val|14000|u=K}} and the plasma had a dispersion velocity of \u00b1450&nbsp;km/s.<ref name=\"DibaiEsipovPronik1968\"/>\n\nAmong astronomers, the accepted explanation for the active nucleus in NGC 5548 is the accretion of matter onto a [[supermassive black hole]] (SMBH) at the core. This object is surrounded by an orbiting disk of accreted matter drawn in from the surroundings. As material is drawn into the outer parts of this disk, it becomes [[Photoionization|photoionized]], producing broad emission lines in the optical and [[ultraviolet]] bands of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. A wind of ionized matter, organized in filamentary structures at distances of 1\u201314 light days from the center, is flowing outward in the direction perpendicular to the accretion disk plane.<ref name=\"AAA551_L6\"/>\n\nThe mass of the central black hole can be estimated based on the properties of the emission lines in the core region. Combined measurements yield an estimated mass of {{val|6.54|+0.26|-0.25|e=7|ul=M_solar}}. In other words, it is some 65 million times the mass of the [[Sun]]. This result is consistent with other methods of estimating the mass of the SMBH in the nucleus of NGC 5548.<ref name=\"AAA662_205\"/> Matter is falling onto this black hole at the estimated rate of {{val|0.03|u=M_solar}} per year, whereas mass is flowing outward from the core at or above the rate of {{val|0.92|u=M_solar}} each year.<ref name=\"Crenshaw2009\"/> The inner part of the accretion disk surrounding the SMBH forms a thick, hot [[corona]] spanning several light hours that is emitting [[X-ray astronomy|X-rays]]. When this radiation reaches the [[optically thick]] part of the accretion disk at a radius of around 1\u20132 light days, the X-rays are converted into heat.<ref name=\"ApJ639_46\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=24em|refs=\n<ref name=\"ApJ131_1163\">{{Citation\n | last1     = Skrutskie\n | first1    = M.

Some only lasted decades but others were referred to over many centuries.

For example,  Scutum Sobiescianum was reduced to [[Scutum (constellation)|Scutum]], Mons Mensae to [[Mensa (constellation)|Mensa]], and Apparatus Sculptoris to [[Sculptor (constellation)|Sculptor]].\n\nSome of the northern sky's former constellations were placed in the less populated regions between the traditional brighter constellations just to fill gaps. In the southern skies, new constellations were often created from about the 15th century by voyagers who began journeying south of the equator. European countries like England, France, the Netherlands, German or Italian states, etc., often supported and popularised their own constellation outlines. In some cases, different constellations occupied overlapping areas and included the same stars. These former constellations are often found in older books, [[star chart]]s or star catalogues. \n\nThe eighty-eight modern constellation names and boundaries were standardised by [[Eug\u00e8ne Joseph Delporte|Eugene Delporte]] for the IAU in 1930, under an international agreement, removing any possible astronomical ambiguities between astronomers from different countries.<ref name=\"Lachi\u00e8ze-ReyLuminet2001\">{{cite book\n|author1=Marc Lachi\u00e8ze-Rey\n|author2=Jean-Pierre Luminet\n|author3=Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France.

For example,  Scutum Sobiescianum was reduced to [[Scutum (constellation)|Scutum]], Mons Mensae to [[Mensa (constellation)|Mensa]], and Apparatus Sculptoris to [[Sculptor (constellation)|Sculptor]].\n\nSome of the northern sky's former constellations were placed in the less populated regions between the traditional brighter constellations just to fill gaps. In the southern skies, new constellations were often created from about the 15th century by voyagers who began journeying south of the equator. European countries like England, France, the Netherlands, German or Italian states, etc., often supported and popularised their own constellation outlines. In some cases, different constellations occupied overlapping areas and included the same stars. These former constellations are often found in older books, [[star chart]]s or star catalogues. \n\nThe eighty-eight modern constellation names and boundaries were standardised by [[Eug\u00e8ne Joseph Delporte|Eugene Delporte]] for the IAU in 1930, under an international agreement, removing any possible astronomical ambiguities between astronomers from different countries.<ref name=\"Lachi\u00e8ze-ReyLuminet2001\">{{cite book\n|author1=Marc Lachi\u00e8ze-Rey\n|author2=Jean-Pierre Luminet\n|author3=Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France.

When several or more of the electrons that are normally bound to the atom in orbits around the atomic nucleus are freed, they form an independent electron gas cloud co-existing with the surrounding gas of atomic ions and neutral atoms. In turn, this generates an [[electric field]], where the motion of charges generates currents, making a localised [[magnetic field]], and creates the state of matter called [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. \n\nThe Saha equation describes the degree of ionization for any gas in thermal equilibrium as a function of the temperature, density, and ionization energies of the atoms. The Saha equation only holds for weakly ionized plasmas for which the [[Debye length]] is large. This means that the screening of the Coulomb interaction of ions and electrons by other ions and electrons is negligible. The subsequent lowering of the ionization potentials and the \"cutoff\" of the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] is therefore also negligible.\n\nFor a gas composed of a single atomic species, the Saha equation is written:\n\n:<math>\\frac{n_{i+1}n_e}{n_i} = \\frac{2}{\\lambda^{3}}\\frac{g_{i+1}}{g_i}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{(\\epsilon_{i+1}-\\epsilon_i)}{k_B T}\\right]</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n* <math>n_i</math> is the density of atoms in the ''i''-th state of ionization, that is with ''i'' electrons removed.\n* <math>g_i</math> is the [[Degenerate energy level|degeneracy]] of states for the ''i''-ions\n* <math>\\epsilon_i</math> is the energy required to remove ''i'' electrons from a neutral atom, creating an ''i''-level ion.\n* <math>n_e</math> is the [[electron density]]\n* <math>\\lambda</math> is the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]] of an electron\n::<math>\\lambda \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\   \\sqrt{\\frac{h^2}{2\\pi m_e k_B T}}</math>\n* <math>m_e</math> is the [[Mass of electron#Properties and behavior|mass of an electron]]\n* <math>T</math> is the [[temperature]] of the gas\n* <math>h</math> is [[Planck's constant]]\n\nThe expression <math>(\\epsilon_{i+1}-\\epsilon_i)</math> is the energy required to remove the <math>(i+1)^{th}</math> electron. In the case where only one level of ionization is important, we have <math>n_1=n_e</math> and defining the total density ''n''&nbsp; as <math>n=n_0+n_1</math>, the Saha equation simplifies to:\n\n:<math>\\frac{n_e^2}{n-n_e} = \\frac{2}{\\lambda^3}\\frac{g_1}{g_0}\\exp\\left[\\frac{-\\epsilon}{k_B T}\\right]</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\epsilon</math> is the energy of ionization.\n\n==Particle densities==\nThe Saha equation is useful for determining the ratio of particle densities for two different ionization levels.  The most useful form of the Saha equation for this purpose is\n\n:<math>\\frac{Z_i}{N_i} = \\frac{Z_{i+1}Z_e}{N_{i+1}N_e}</math>,\n\nwhere ''Z'' denotes the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]].  The Saha equation can be seen as a restatement of the equilibrium condition for the [[chemical potential]]s:\n\n:<math>\\mu_i = \\mu_{i+1} + \\mu_e\\,</math>\n\nThis equation simply states that the potential for an atom of ionization state ''i'' to ionize is the same as the potential for an electron and an atom of ionization state ''i+1''; the potentials are equal, therefore the system is in equilibrium and no ''net'' change of ionization will occur.<br />\n\n==Stellar atmospheres==\nIn the early twenties [[Ralph H. Fowler]] (in collaboration with [[Charles Galton Darwin]]) developed a new method in [[statistical mechanics]] permitting a systematic calculation of the equilibrium properties of matter. He used this to provide a rigorous derivation of the ionization formula which Saha had obtained, by extending to the ionization of atoms the theorem of [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]], used in physical chemistry for its application to molecular dissociation. Also, a significant improvement in the Saha equation introduced by Fowler was to include the effect of the excited states of atoms and ions. A further important step forward came in 1923, when [[Edward Arthur Milne]] and R.H. Fowler published a paper in the ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'', showing that the criterion of the maximum intensity of absorption lines (belonging to subordinate series of a neutral atom) was much more fruitful in giving information about physical parameters of stellar atmospheres than the criterion employed by Saha which consisted in the marginal appearance or disappearance of absorption lines. The latter criterion requires some knowledge of the relevant pressures in the stellar atmospheres, and Saha following the generally accepted view at the time assumed a value of the order of 1 to 0.1 atmosphere. Milne wrote:\n<blockquote>\nSaha had concentrated on the marginal appearances and disappearances of absorption lines in the stellar sequence, assuming an order of magnitude for the pressure in a stellar atmosphere and calculating the temperature where increasing ionization, for example, inhibited further absorption of the line in question owing to the loss of the series electron. As Fowler and I were one day stamping round my rooms in Trinity and discussing this, it suddenly occurred to me that the maximum intensity of the [[Balmer series|Balmer lines of hydrogen]], for example, was readily explained by the consideration that at the lower temperatures there were too few excited atoms to give appreciable absorption, whilst at the higher temperatures there are too few neutral atoms left to give any absorption. ..That evening I did a hasty order of magnitude calculation of the effect and found that to agree with a temperature of 10000\u00b0 [K] for the stars of type A0, where the Balmer lines have their maximum, a pressure of the order of 10<sup>\u22124</sup> atmosphere was required. This was very exciting, because standard determinations of pressures in stellar atmospheres from line shifts and line widths had been supposed to indicate a pressure of the order of one atmosphere or more, and I had begun on other grounds to disbelieve this.<ref>{{cite web | title = Biographical Memoirs: Meghnad Saha | url = http://www.saha.ac.in/web/founder/founder-life-works?showall=1&limitstart=}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Stellar coronae==\nSaha equilibrium prevails when the plasma is in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium#Local and global equilibrium|local thermodynamic equilibrium]], which is not the case in the optically-thin [[Stellar corona|corona]].\nHere the equilibrium ionization states must be estimated by detailed statistical calculation of collision and recombination rates.\n\n==The early universe==\nEquilibrium ionization, described by the Saha equation, explains evolution in the early universe.

The probe comprised an entry probe, designed to enter the Venus atmosphere and parachute to the surface, and a carrier/flyby spacecraft, which carried the entry probe to Venus and served as a communications relay for the entry probe.\n\nIn 1967 it was the first successful probe to perform in-place analysis of the environment of another [[planet]]. Venera&nbsp;4 provided the first chemical analysis of the Venusian atmosphere, showing it to be primarily [[carbon dioxide]] with a few percent of [[nitrogen]] and below one percent of [[oxygen]] and water vapors. While entering the atmosphere it became the first spacecraft to survive entry into another planet's atmosphere.{{sfn|Siddiqi|2018|p=1}} The station detected a weak magnetic field and no radiation field. The outer atmospheric layer contained very little hydrogen and no atomic oxygen.{{citation needed|date = October 2017}} The probe sent the first direct measurements proving that Venus was extremely hot, that its atmosphere was far denser than expected, and that it had lost most of its water long ago.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Venera-4 capsule in museum.JPG|thumb|left|190px|Capsule of Venera 4]]\nThe main carrier spacecraft&nbsp;4 stood {{convert|3.5|m}} high, its solar panels spanned {{convert|4|m}} and had an area of {{convert|2.5|m2}}. The carrier spacecraft included a 2-meter long [[magnetometer]], an ion detector, a cosmic ray detector and an [[Lyman-alpha forest|ultraviolet spectrometer]] capable of detecting hydrogen and oxygen gases. The devices were intended to operate until entry into the Venusian atmosphere. At that juncture, the station was designed to release the probe capsule and disintegrate. The rear part of the carrier spacecraft contained a liquid-fuel thruster capable of correcting the flight course. The flight program was planned to include two significant course corrections, for which purpose the station could receive and execute up to 127&nbsp;different commands sent from the Earth.{{sfn|Harvey|2007|pp=98\u2013101}}\n\nThe front part of the carrier spacecraft contained a nearly spherical landing capsule {{convert|1|m}} in diameter and weighing {{convert|383|kg}}. Compared to previous (failed) [[Venera program|Venera]] probes, the capsule contained an improved heat shield which could withstand temperatures up to {{convert|11000|C}}. Instead of the previous liquid-based cooling design, a simpler and more reliable gas system was installed.<ref name=v3>{{cite web|url=http://www.laspace.ru/rus/venera4.php|accessdate=7 July 2009|title=Venera 4|language=Russian|website=NPO Lavochkina}}</ref> The durability of the capsule was checked by exposing it to high temperatures, pressures and accelerations using three unique testing installations.

The capsule contained a newly developed vibration-damping system, and its parachute could resist temperatures up to {{convert|450|C|K}}.{{sfn|Ulivi|Harland|2007|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nThe capsule contained an [[altimeter]], thermal control, a parachute and equipment for making atmospheric measurements. The latter included a [[thermometer]], [[barometer]], [[hydrometer]], altimeter and a set of gas analysis instruments. The data were sent by two transmitters at a frequency of 922&nbsp;MHz and a rate of 1&nbsp;bit/s; the measurements were sent every 48&nbsp;seconds. The transmitters were activated by the parachute deployment as soon as the outside pressure reached {{convert|0.6|atm}}, which was thought to occur at the altitude about {{convert|26|km}} above the surface of the planet. The signals were received by several stations, including the [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]].<ref name=v3/>{{sfn|Harvey|2007|pp=98\u2013101}}\n\nThe capsule was equipped with a rechargeable battery with a capacity sufficient for 100&nbsp;minutes of powering the measurement and transmitter systems. To avoid becoming discharged during the flight to Venus, the battery was kept charged using the solar panels of the carrier spacecraft. Before the launch, the entire Venera&nbsp;4 station was sterilized to prevent possible biological contamination of Venus.<ref name=v3/>\n\n==Mission==\nTwo nominally identical 4V-1 probes were launched in June 1967.

Although two such corrections had been planned, the first one was accurate enough and therefore the second correction was canceled.
