Thousands of opposition activists were [[Internment|imprisoned]] without charge and as many as 91 killed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref> Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many of the [[political prisoner]]s were not released until a general [[amnesty]] in 1986.\n\nSince the 1970s, communist Poland was in a deep [[economic recession]]. The First Secretary [[Edward Gierek]] made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Basic goods were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities, food shortages intensified and censorship was placed on all media and [[Mail|post]]. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n===Reforms of Edward Gierek (1970-1975)===\n[[File:Photograph of President Gerald R.

Other suspects and hundreds of other miners across Silesia were sacked and removed from their job posts, which further weakened the economy. \n\nIn May 1982, the protests convened by Solidarity were receiving less attention and the struggle against the government was evidently weakening. However, by August, the social unrest again surged. On 31 August 1982, demonstrations took place in around 66<ref>https://dzieje.pl/aktualnosci/sierpniowe-manifestacje-w-1982-r</ref> towns and cities, with at least 18 in the southwestern [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship|province of Lower Silesia]]. In [[Wroc\u0142aw]], one of main centers of Fighting Solidarity, several thousand people for many hours clashed with ZOMO units.<ref>https://nowahistoria.interia.pl/prl/news-manifestacja-we-wroclawiu-31-sierpnia-1982-roku-kiedy-zomo-u,nId,1067057</ref> One demonstrator was killed by a bullet. \n\nThe copper-mining town of [[Lubin]] also became a hotspot for Solidarity-led rallies.<ref>https://www.polskieradio.pl/39/156/Artykul/2361818,Wydarzenia-lubinskie-Krwawy-sierpien-82-w-Zaglebiu-Miedziowym</ref> On that day, the gathered people sung the Polish national anthem and chanted slurs and slogans against the communist regime, against the military junta with Jaruzelski as its head and against the Soviets. After approximately 30 minutes, the rally of 2,000<ref>https://www.polskieradio.pl/39/156/Artykul/2361818,Wydarzenia-lubinskie-Krwawy-sierpien-82-w-Zaglebiu-Miedziowym</ref> was surrounded by the Militia, armed with [[AK-47]] assault rifles.

I address you concerning extraordinarily important questions. Our homeland is at the edge of an abyss. The achievements of many generations and the Polish home that has been built up from the dust are about to turn into ruins. State structures are ceasing to function. Each day delivers new blows to the waning economy./.../<br>The atmosphere of conflicts, misunderstanding, hatred causes moral degradation, surpasses the limits of toleration. Strikes, the readiness to strike, actions of protest have become a norm of life. Even school youth are being drawn into this. Yesterday evening, many public buildings remained seized. The cries are voiced to physical reprisals with the 'reds', with people who have different opinions. <br>The cases of terror, threats and moral vendetta, of even direct violence are on the rise. A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair. Not only days, but hours as well are bringing forth the all-national disaster./.../<br>Citizens!<br>The load of responsibility that falls on me on this dramatic moment in the Polish history is huge. It is my duty to take this responsibility - concerning the future of Poland, that my generation fought for on all the fronts of the war and for which they sacrificed the best years of their life. I declare, that today the Military Council of National Salvation has been formed. In accordance with the Constitution, the State Council has imposed martial law all over the country. I wish that everyone understood the motives of our actions. A military coup, military dictatorship is not our goal./.../<br> In longer perspective, none of Poland's problems can be solved with the use of violence. The Military Council of National Salvation does not replace constitutional organs of power. Its only purpose is to keep the legal balance of the country, to create guarantees that give a chance to restore order and discipline. This is the ultimate way to bring the country out of the crisis, to save the country from collapse./.../<br>I appeal to all the citizens. A time of heavy trials has arrived. And we have to stand those in order to prove that we are worthy of Poland.<br>Before all the Polish people and the whole world I would like to repeat the immortal words: <br>\n::'''''[[Poland Is Not Yet Lost|Poland has not yet perished, so long as we still live]]!'''''</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cold War]]\n* [[Able Archer 83]]\n* [[Fighting Solidarity]]\n* [[Pacification of Wujek]]\n* [[Telephone tapping in the Eastern Bloc]]\n* [[Soviet reaction to the Polish Crisis of 1980-1981]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Leopold Labedz, ''Poland Under Jaruzelski: A Comprehensive Sourcebook on Poland During and After Martial Law''\n* George Sanford, ''Military Rule in Poland: The Rebuilding of Communist Power, 1981\u20131983''\n{{Portal|Poland|History|Communism|War|1980s}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Martial law in Poland}}\n* [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB211/index.htm Solidarity and Martial Law in Poland: 25 Years Later], [[National Security Archive]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110112170636/http://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1900s/yr80/fpoland1981.htm Martial Law in Poland 1981-1983]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080105033603/http://www.tenetour.com/history9.php Martial Law in Poland]\n* [http://www.videofact.com/english/stanwoj2.htm Martial Law in Poland 1981]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKhITm9-5TU Video of Jaruzelski declaring martial law], [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]]/[[YouTube]]\n* [http://www.pbase.com/zyziza/martial_law_in_poland Photo Gallery by zyziza at pbase.com]\n\n{{History of the People's Republic of Poland}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martial Law In Poland}}\n[[Category:1980s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts]]\n[[Category:1981 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1981 in politics]]\n[[Category:1982 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1982 in politics]]\n[[Category:1983 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1983 in politics]]\n[[Category:Anti-communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1981]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1982]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1983]]\n[[Category:Emergency laws]]\n[[Category:Martial law|Poland]]\n[[Category:Military coups in Poland]]\n[[Category:Military dictatorships|Poland]]\n[[Category:Poland\u2013Soviet Union relations]]\n[[Category:Solidarity (Polish trade union)]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Coup d'\u00e9tat}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Martial law in Poland\n| place       = {{flagicon|Poland}} [[Poland]]\n| partof      = the [[Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980\u20131981]]\n| combatant1  = {{flagicon|Polish People's Republic}} [[Polish People's Republic]]\n* [[Polish People's Army]]\n* [[Milicja_Obywatelska|Citizens' Militia (MO)]]\n* [[ZOMO]]\n* [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|Secret Service (SB)]]\n----\n'''Supported by:''' \n{{flag|Soviet Union}} ({{small|Intelligence support and military equipment}})\n| combatant2  = {{flagicon image|}} [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity Movement]]\n* [[Fighting Solidarity]] <br><small>(from 1982)</small>\n* Protesters\n----\n'''Supported by:''' \n{{flag|United States}} ({{small|Financial support}})\n| casualties1 = Unknown\n| casualties2 = \n*91 killed\n*Thousands arrested\n| commander1  = [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] \n* [[Czes\u0142aw Kiszczak]]\n| commander2  = [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]]\n*[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Frasyniuk]]\n| image       = File:T-55A Martial law Poland.jpg\n| image_size  = 280px\n| caption     = A column of Polish [[T-55]] tanks enters the town of [[Zb\u0105szy\u0144]] while moving east towards the city of [[Pozna\u0144]], 13 December 1981\n| date        = 13 December 1981 \u2013 22 July 1983\n({{Age in years, months, weeks and days|month1=12|day1=13|year1=1981|month2=07|day2=22|year2=1983}})\n| result      = Decisive Polish government victory\n*Crackdown on opposition\n*Protests suppressed \n*Deepened economic crisis\n*Continued resistance until 1989\n| strength1   ='''Initial strength''':<ref>https://culture.pl/en/article/the-day-poland-stood-still-memories-from-the-introduction-of-martial-law</ref>\n*80,000 soldiers\n*30,000 policemen\n*1,750 tanks\n*1,900 combat vehicles\n*9,000 cars\n| strength2   = ~ 10 million (1981)\n}}\n\n'''Martial law in Poland''' ({{lang-pl|Stan wojenny w Polsce}}) refers to the period between 13 December 1981 and 22 July 1983, when the [[authoritarian]] [[communist government]] of the [[Polish People's Republic]] drastically restricted normal life by introducing [[martial law]] and a [[military junta]] in an attempt to throttle political opposition, in particular the [[Solidarity Movement]]. Thousands of opposition activists were [[Internment|imprisoned]] without charge and as many as 91 killed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref> Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many of the [[political prisoner]]s were not released until a general [[amnesty]] in 1986.\n\nSince the 1970s, communist Poland was in a deep [[economic recession]]. The First Secretary [[Edward Gierek]] made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Basic goods were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities, food shortages intensified and censorship was placed on all media and [[Mail|post]]. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n===Reforms of Edward Gierek (1970-1975)===\n[[File:Photograph of President Gerald R.

As part of the crackdown, media and educational institutions underwent \"verification\", a process that tested each employee's attitude towards the regime and to the Solidarity movement; as a result, thousands of journalists, teachers and professors were banned from their professions. [[Military court]]s were established to bypass the normal court system, to imprison those spreading \"false information\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/special_report/1999/09/99/iron_curtain/timelines/poland_81.stm 1981: Martial law], [[BBC]]</ref> In an attempt to crush resistance, civilian phone lines were routinely tapped and monitored by government agents.\n\n===Synopsis===\n\nDuring the initial imposition of martial law, several dozen people were killed.

The Hungarians shared with their Polish colleagues their experiences on crushing the [[1956 Hungarian revolution|\"counterrevolution\" of 1956]].

It also led to severe economic consequences. The ruling [[military dictatorship]] instituted major price rises (dubbed \"economic reforms\"), which resulted in a fall in real wages of 20% or more. The resulting [[economic crisis]] led to the [[rationing]] of most products and materials, including basic foodstuffs.\n\nAs a consequence of economic hardship and political repression, an exodus of Poles saw 700,000 emigrate to the West between 1981 and 1989.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nypuJ8BARiMC&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=poland+economy+1980s&source=bl&ots=iR_fCDeyE6&sig=q2hNTHlJPvd7MOfHIhY-lEKmJsc&hl=en&ei=lLEbS6OKG8z_4Abzt4TnAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CDIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=poland%20economy%201980s&f=false Google Books]</ref> \nA number of international flights were even hijacked in attempts to flee the country and its economic problems.

However, the Sejm had been in session at the time when martial law was instituted. In 1992 the Sejm declared the 1981 imposition of martial law to be unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\n===Soviet intervention debate===\n{{further|Soviet reaction to the Polish Crisis of 1980-1981}}\n\nThe instigators of the martial law, such as [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], argue that the army crackdown rescued Poland from a possibly disastrous [[military intervention]] of the [[Soviet Union]], [[East Germany]], and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries (similar to the earlier interventions in [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary in 1956]] and [[Prague Spring|Czechoslovakia in 1968]]).<ref>[http://www.euronews.net/2008/10/02/jaruzelski-says-martial-law-saved-poland/ Jaruzelski says martial law saved Poland], [[Euronews]], 02/10/08</ref> Public figures who supported the introduction of martial law (including some of the right-wing figures like [[J\u0119drzej Giertych]]) would also refer to that threat.\n\nIn 2009, archive documents hinted that in a conversation Jaruzelski had with [[Viktor Kulikov]], a Soviet military leader, Jaruzelski himself begged for Soviet intervention as his domestic control was deteriorating.<ref>[http://www.newpolandexpress.pl/npe_news_story-1531-jaruzelski_invited_soviet_invasion.php Newpolandexpress.pl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009161848/http://www.newpolandexpress.pl/npe_news_story-1531-jaruzelski_invited_soviet_invasion.php |date=2011-10-09 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.rferl.org/content/Interview_Polands_Jaruzelski_Again_Denies_Seeking_Soviet_Intervention_Against_Solidarity/1902431.html Rferl.org]</ref> Jaruzelski responded by claiming the document was 'just another falsification'.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Declaration script==\nLed by [[General of the Army]] [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], the [[Military Council of National Salvation]] (''Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego'', WRON) usurped for itself powers reserved for wartime, hence the name.

I address you concerning extraordinarily important questions. Our homeland is at the edge of an abyss. The achievements of many generations and the Polish home that has been built up from the dust are about to turn into ruins. State structures are ceasing to function. Each day delivers new blows to the waning economy./.../<br>The atmosphere of conflicts, misunderstanding, hatred causes moral degradation, surpasses the limits of toleration. Strikes, the readiness to strike, actions of protest have become a norm of life. Even school youth are being drawn into this. Yesterday evening, many public buildings remained seized. The cries are voiced to physical reprisals with the 'reds', with people who have different opinions. <br>The cases of terror, threats and moral vendetta, of even direct violence are on the rise. A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair. Not only days, but hours as well are bringing forth the all-national disaster./.../<br>Citizens!<br>The load of responsibility that falls on me on this dramatic moment in the Polish history is huge. It is my duty to take this responsibility - concerning the future of Poland, that my generation fought for on all the fronts of the war and for which they sacrificed the best years of their life. I declare, that today the Military Council of National Salvation has been formed. In accordance with the Constitution, the State Council has imposed martial law all over the country. I wish that everyone understood the motives of our actions. A military coup, military dictatorship is not our goal./.../<br> In longer perspective, none of Poland's problems can be solved with the use of violence. The Military Council of National Salvation does not replace constitutional organs of power. Its only purpose is to keep the legal balance of the country, to create guarantees that give a chance to restore order and discipline. This is the ultimate way to bring the country out of the crisis, to save the country from collapse./.../<br>I appeal to all the citizens. A time of heavy trials has arrived. And we have to stand those in order to prove that we are worthy of Poland.<br>Before all the Polish people and the whole world I would like to repeat the immortal words: <br>\n::'''''[[Poland Is Not Yet Lost|Poland has not yet perished, so long as we still live]]!'''''</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Able Archer 83]]\n* [[Fighting Solidarity]]\n* [[Pacification of Wujek]]\n* [[Polish 1970 protests]]\n* [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests]]\n* [[Romanian Revolution]], 1989\n* [[Soviet reaction to the Polish Crisis of 1980-1981]]\n* [[Telephone tapping in the Eastern Bloc]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Leopold Labedz, ''Poland Under Jaruzelski: A Comprehensive Sourcebook on Poland During and After Martial Law''\n* George Sanford, ''Military Rule in Poland: The Rebuilding of Communist Power, 1981\u20131983''\n{{Portal|Poland|History|Communism|War|1980s}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Martial law in Poland}}\n* [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB211/index.htm Solidarity and Martial Law in Poland: 25 Years Later], [[National Security Archive]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110112170636/http://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1900s/yr80/fpoland1981.htm Martial Law in Poland 1981-1983]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080105033603/http://www.tenetour.com/history9.php Martial Law in Poland]\n* [http://www.videofact.com/english/stanwoj2.htm Martial Law in Poland 1981]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKhITm9-5TU Video of Jaruzelski declaring martial law], [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]]/[[YouTube]]\n* [http://www.pbase.com/zyziza/martial_law_in_poland Photo Gallery by zyziza at pbase.com]\n\n{{History of the People's Republic of Poland}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martial Law In Poland}}\n[[Category:1980s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts]]\n[[Category:1981 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1981 in politics]]\n[[Category:1982 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1982 in politics]]\n[[Category:1983 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1983 in politics]]\n[[Category:Anti-communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1981]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1982]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1983]]\n[[Category:Emergency laws]]\n[[Category:Martial law|Poland]]\n[[Category:Military coups in Poland]]\n[[Category:Military dictatorships|Poland]]\n[[Category:Poland\u2013Soviet Union relations]]\n[[Category:Solidarity (Polish trade union)]]\n", "name_user": "Oliszydlowski", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also:removed directly unrelated links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law_in_Poland"}

Usually there are several pairs of these squares, and the members of each pair are labeled with the same number, e.g. '''1''', '''2''', etc. In some cases they indicate which square the defending [[king (chess)|king]] must move to in order to keep the opposing king away.  In other cases, a maneuver by one king puts the other player in a situation where he cannot move to the corresponding square, thus the first king is able to penetrate the position {{Harvcol|M\u00fcller|Lamprecht|2007|pp=188\u2013203}}.  The theory of corresponding squares is more general than [[opposition (chess)|opposition]], and is more useful in cluttered positions.\n{{algebraic notation|pos=tocleft}}\n\n==Details==\nCorresponding squares are squares of reciprocal (or mutual) [[zugzwang]].  They occur most often in king and pawn [[Chess endgame|endgames]], especially with [[triangulation (chess)|triangulation]], [[opposition (chess)|opposition]], and [[mined squares]].  A square that White can move to corresponds to a square that Black can move to. If one player moves to such a square, the opponent moves to the corresponding square to put the opponent in zugzwang {{Harvcol|Dvoretsky|2006|pp=15\u201320}}.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===A simple example===\n{{Chess diagram\n|tright\n|Corresponding squares\n\n|  |  |x1|x3|x2|  |  |  \n|  |  |xx|x3|xx|  |  |  \n|  |  |x1|pl|x2|  |  |  \n|  |  |x3|x3|x3|  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|Numbered squares are corresponding squares in king and pawn versus king.  Squares marked \"x\" are key squares.\n}}\nOne of the simplest and most important uses of corresponding squares is in this [[king and pawn versus king endgame]].  Assume that the black king is in front of the pawn and the white king is behind or to the side of the pawn.  The black king is trying to block the white pawn and the white king is supporting its pawn.  If the white king gets to any of the [[key square]]s (marked with \"x\"), he wins.  Suppose the black king moves to the square labeled \"1\" near him (square c8).  Then if the white king moves ''to'' the corresponding square (also labeled \"1\", square c6), he wins.  Conversely, if the white king moves to the \"1\" square then the black king must move to the corresponding square to [[draw (chess)|draw]].  Thus if both kings are on the \"1\" squares, the position is a reciprocal zugzwang. Note that the second player moving ''to'' one of the corresponding squares has the advantage.  Being on a square when the opponent is not on the corresponding square is a disadvantage.\n\nThe squares labeled \"2\" are similar corresponding squares.  If the white king is on the ''d5'' square (the middle one labeled \"3\"), he is threatening to move to either the \"1\" square or the \"2\" square.  Therefore, the black king must be in a position to move to either his \"1\" square or his \"2\" square in order to hold the draw, so he must be on one of his \"3\" squares.  This makes the defense for Black clear: shift between the squares labeled \"3\" until the white king moves to his \"1\" or \"2\" square, and then go to the corresponding square, gaining the opposition.  If the black king moves to the \"1\" or \"2\" squares under any other circumstances, the white king moves to the corresponding square, takes the opposition, the black king moves, and White advances the pawn and will [[promotion (chess)|promote]] it and win, with a basic [[checkmate]].\n\nThe ''c5'' and ''e5'' squares can also be label \"3\" squares, since if the white king is on one of them, the black king must be on one of his \"3\" squares to draw.\n\n===A second example===\n{{Chess diagram\n|tright\n|R\u00f6sch-Mast 1995\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |pd|  |  \n|  |  |  |  |kd|  |  |  \n|  |  |  |x1|  |x1|  |pd\n|  |  |  |x2|kl|x2|  |pl\n|  |  |  |x3|  |x3|  |  \n|White to move, but drawn with either side to move\n}}\nThis is another example that is fairly simple.  The [[List of chess terms#Key square|''key squares'']] (see [[king and pawn versus king endgame]]) are e1, e2, e3, and f3.  If the black king gets to any of those squares, Black wins.  The job of the white king is to keep the black king off those squares.  One might think that Black has the advantage, since he has the [[opposition (chess)|opposition]].  White can defend the two key squares of e3 and f3 by oscillating between e2 and f2.  White's defense is simple if he observes the corresponding squares:\n: '''1. Kf2!'''

It was originally written as a slow song for ''[[Treasure Girl]]'' (1928) and found another, faster setting in ''Girl Crazy''. [[Ethel Merman]] sang the song in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production and Broadway lore holds that [[George Gershwin]], after seeing her opening reviews, warned her never to take a singing lesson.\n\nThe piece was originally penned in the key of D{{music|flat}} major. The song melody uses four notes of the five-note [[pentatonic scale]], first rising, then falling. A rhythmic interest in the song is that the tune keeps behind the main pulse, with the three \"I got...\" phrases [[Syncopation|syncopated]], appearing one beat behind in the first bar, while the fourth phase \"Who could...\" rushes in to the song. The song's chorus is in a 34-bar [[AABA form]].<ref>Covach, John (2005), \"Form in Rock Music: A Primer\", in Stein, Deborah, ''Engaging Music: Essays in Music Analysis'', New York: Oxford University Press, p.70, {{ISBN|0-19-517010-5}} .</ref> Its chord progression (although often reduced to a standard 32-bar structure, for the sake of improvised solos), is known as the \"[[rhythm changes]]\", and is the foundation for many other popular jazz tunes. The song was used as the theme in Gershwin's last concert piece for piano and orchestra, the ''[[Variations on \"I Got Rhythm\"]]'', written in 1934. The song has become symbolic of the Gershwins, of swing, and of the 1920s.\n\nAs usual, George Gershwin wrote the melody first and gave it to Ira to set, but Ira found it an unusually hard melody for which to create lyrics. He experimented for two weeks with the rhyme scheme he felt the music called for, sets of triple rhymes, but found that the heavy rhyming \"seemed at best to give a pleasant and jingly Mother Goose quality to a tune which should throw its weight around more.\" Finally he began to experiment with leaving most of the lines unrhymed. \"This approach felt stronger,\" he wrote, \"and I finally arrived at the present refrain, with only 'more-door' and 'mind him-find him' the rhymes.\" He added that this approach \"was a bit daring for me who usually depended on rhyme insurance.\"<ref name=\"occasions\">{{cite book | last=Gershwin | first=Ira | title=Lyrics on Several Occasions | edition=First | location=New York | publisher=Knopf | year=1959 | oclc=538209}}</ref>\n\nIra also wrote that although the phrase \"who could ask for anything more?\" is repeated four times in the song, he decided not to make it the title because \"somehow the first line of the refrain sounded more arresting and provocative.\"<ref name=\"occasions\"/>\n\n== History ==\nThe song was included in the Gershwin brothers' 1931 Broadway musical.

[[Gene Kelly]] sang the song and [[Tap dance|tap-danced]], while French-speaking children whom he had just taught a few words of English shouted the words \"I got\" each time they appeared in the lyrics. This version finished at #32 in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] survey of top tunes in American cinema.\n\nIt is also featured in the film ''[[Mr. Holland's Opus]]'', during a scene in which students are trying out for a Gershwin revue.\n\nAlso featured in the movie \"My Girl\", during a dinner scene when the grandmother sang it, oblivious of the others.\n\nA complete list of notable singers who have recorded this song would take up several pages.

It's the title track and first single released from the band's eighth studio album [[By the Way|of the same name]]. The song was the band's sixth number 1 hit on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, staying at the summit for 14 weeks, tying it with \"[[Dani California]]\" as the band's second-longest stay at the top, behind only \"[[Scar Tissue]],\" which was at the top for 16 weeks. It also spent seven weeks at number 1 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, the band's fourth song to top this chart. The song also reached number 2 in the UK, becoming the band's highest-peaking single there alongside \"Dani California,\" and peaked atop the Italian chart.\n\nRegarding its release, guitarist [[John Frusciante]] noted: \"It wasn't really our decision to put that song out first, but our managers thought it was an exciting song and their enthusiasm convinced us. I guess they thought that it combined the wild part of our sound with the melodic part of our sound.\"<ref name=\"kerrang\">[[Kerrang!]] Yearbook (2002), pg.25</ref> Vocalist [[Anthony Kiedis]] elaborated: \"I thought that single was an \u00fcber-bombastic assault of non-commercialism. For it to be so well-received [in the [[United Kingdom]]] was shocking to me, but thrilling at the same time.\"<ref name=\"kerrang\"/>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video was directed by [[Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris]], a couple who have directed many other music videos for the band.\n\nThe video starts off with Kiedis calling for a taxi. He gets in the taxi and the cabbie (played by [[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]]) realizes he has him as his passenger. To please him, the driver puts a copy of the \"By the Way\" single into the taxi CD player, making Kiedis smile slightly. Suddenly, the cabbie begins driving out of control as he lip-syncs the song while driving rambunctiously throughout the streets of Los Angeles. After he locks the car door, an uncomfortable and apprehensive Kiedis attempts to make a call on his cell phone, but the cabbie brakes so hard that Kiedis loses grip of it. The cabbie snatches the phone and throws it out the window, then drives the car in a cloud of dust and backs up under a bridge.\n\nWhile there, the cabbie pulls out flare sticks and begins to torture Kiedis through awkward dancing while the latter finally pages bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] and Frusciante (with a message reading, \"Help! Been kidnapped.\"), who are having lunch in a cafe. At first, they think it's a hoax, so they ignore the first message. When Kiedis pages them for the second time, they set out on Flea's Ford Bronco to find him with the crazy cabbie in the taxi. A wild chase and road rage ensues. Kiedis soon sees Flea and Frusciante, breaks out of the taxi window, and jumps in Flea's truck with a sigh of relief as the three escape the cabbie. At the end of the video, drummer [[Chad Smith]] flags down the taxi, with the cabbie realizing he is also a member of the band, so he lets him in and drives off with him. However, Chad is unaware that this is the same taxi man that kidnapped Kiedis and also ignores the broken glass.\n\nKiedis said of the video:\n\n{{quote|It\u2019s kidnapping\u2026 A cab driver kidnaps me and just goes haywire through the town; he\u2019s a fan, but he\u2019s kind of a [pause] obsessive, compulsive, psychologically misarranged fan, and he sees me and starts enjoying himself a little too much and my friends have to come and rescue me.<ref>The Making of: By the Way; ''[[Greatest Hits (Red Hot Chili Peppers album)|Greatest Hits]]''</ref>}}\n\nThe fast and often jerky camera angles used in the high-speed chase sequences are based on the 2000 Mexican film ''[[Amores Perros]]'' in which all the characters are linked by a car crash at the beginning of the film; before the crash is an almost identical high speed car chase sequence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1454521/red-hot-chili-peppers-new-single-about-joy-car-crashes-playing-dice/ |title=Red Hot Chili Peppers' New Single About Joy, Car Crashes, Playing Dice |publisher=MTV |date=May 23, 2002 |accessdate=October 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==\"Waiting 4\" Peter Gelderblom remix==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Waiting 4\n| cover      = \n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Peter Gelderblom]]\n| album      =\n| released   = {{Start date|2007|07|05}} <small>(bootleg)</small><br>{{Start date|2007|12|3}} <small>(official)</small>\n| format     = [[Music download|Digital download]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Electro house]], [[electronic rock]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=3|s=15}}\n| label      = [[Data Records|Data]]\n| writer     = [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[John Frusciante|Frusciante]], [[Anthony Kiedis|Kiedis]], [[Chad Smith|Smith]]\n| producer   = Rene Amesz, Peter Gelderblom\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nAn [[electro house]] remix of \"By the Way\" by [[Peter Gelderblom]] with co-production by Rene Amesz, was released on 5 July 2007, and became a popular track in clubs worldwide despite being released without the band's knowledge or approval.

It's the title track and first single released from the band's eighth studio album [[By the Way|of the same name]]. The song was the band's sixth number 1 hit on the [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, staying at the summit for 14 weeks, tying it with \"[[Dani California]]\" as the band's second-longest stay at the top, behind only \"[[Scar Tissue]],\" which was at the top for 16 weeks. It also spent seven weeks at number 1 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, the band's fourth song to top this chart. The song also reached number 2 in the UK, becoming the band's highest-peaking single there alongside \"Dani California,\" and peaked atop the Italian chart.\n\nRegarding its release, guitarist [[John Frusciante]] noted: \"It wasn't really our decision to put that song out first, but our managers thought it was an exciting song and their enthusiasm convinced us. I guess they thought that it combined the wild part of our sound with the melodic part of our sound.\"<ref name=\"kerrang\">[[Kerrang!]] Yearbook (2002), pg.25</ref> Vocalist [[Anthony Kiedis]] elaborated: \"I thought that single was an \u00fcber-bombastic assault of non-commercialism. For it to be so well-received [in the [[United Kingdom]]] was shocking to me, but thrilling at the same time.\"<ref name=\"kerrang\"/>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video was directed by [[Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris]], a couple who have directed many other music videos for the band.\n\nThe video starts off with Kiedis calling for a taxi. He gets in the taxi and the cabbie (played by [[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]]) realizes he has him as his passenger. To please him, the driver puts a copy of the \"By the Way\" single into the taxi CD player, making Kiedis smile slightly. Suddenly, the cabbie begins driving out of control as he lip-syncs the song while driving rambunctiously throughout the streets of Los Angeles. After he locks the car door, an uncomfortable and apprehensive Kiedis attempts to make a call on his cell phone, but the cabbie brakes so hard that Kiedis loses grip of it. The cabbie snatches the phone and throws it out the window, then drives the car in a cloud of dust and backs up under a bridge.\n\nWhile there, the cabbie pulls out flare sticks and begins to torture Kiedis through awkward dancing while the latter finally pages bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] and Frusciante (with a message reading, \"Help! Been kidnapped.\"), who are having lunch in a cafe. At first, they think it's a hoax, so they ignore the first message. When Kiedis pages them for the second time, they set out on Flea's Ford Bronco to find him with the crazy cabbie in the taxi. A wild chase and road rage ensues. Kiedis soon sees Flea and Frusciante, breaks out of the taxi window, and jumps in Flea's truck with a sigh of relief as the three escape the cabbie. At the end of the video, drummer [[Chad Smith]] flags down the taxi, with the cabbie realizing he is also a member of the band, so he lets him in and drives off with him. However, Chad is unaware that this is the same taxi man that kidnapped Kiedis and also ignores the broken glass.\n\nKiedis said of the video:\n\n{{quote|It\u2019s kidnapping\u2026 A cab driver kidnaps me and just goes haywire through the town; he\u2019s a fan, but he\u2019s kind of a [pause] obsessive, compulsive, psychologically misarranged fan, and he sees me and starts enjoying himself a little too much and my friends have to come and rescue me.<ref>The Making of: By the Way; ''[[Greatest Hits (Red Hot Chili Peppers album)|Greatest Hits]]''</ref>}}\n\nThe fast and often jerky camera angles used in the high-speed chase sequences are based on the 2000 Mexican film ''[[Amores Perros]]'' in which all the characters are linked by a car crash at the beginning of the film; before the crash is an almost identical high speed car chase sequence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1454521/red-hot-chili-peppers-new-single-about-joy-car-crashes-playing-dice/ |title=Red Hot Chili Peppers' New Single About Joy, Car Crashes, Playing Dice |publisher=MTV |date=May 23, 2002 |accessdate=October 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==\"Waiting 4\" Peter Gelderblom remix==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Waiting 4\n| cover      = \n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Peter Gelderblom]]\n| album      =\n| released   = {{Start date|2007|07|05}} <small>(bootleg)</small><br>{{Start date|2007|12|3}} <small>(official)</small>\n| format     = [[Music download|Digital download]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Electro house]], [[electronic rock]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=3|s=15}}\n| label      = [[Data Records|Data]]\n| writer     = [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[John Frusciante|Frusciante]], [[Anthony Kiedis|Kiedis]], [[Chad Smith|Smith]]\n| producer   = Rene Amesz, Peter Gelderblom\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nAn [[electro house]] remix of \"By the Way\" by [[Peter Gelderblom]] with co-production by Rene Amesz, was released on 5 July 2007, and became a popular track in clubs worldwide despite being released without the band's knowledge or approval.
