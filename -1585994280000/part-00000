The idea was to create a world-class town approximately 25&nbsp; km from Noida. A railway station near [[Boraki Railway Station|Boraki]] and an international airport were included later in the plan intending to develop Greater Noida as an independent city.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Noida extension (now a part of [[Gautam Buddh Nagar]]) became what is today known as Greater Noida. The Greater NOIDA Authority manages the development of the city. Greater Noida is connected to [[Agra]] by the six-lane [[Yamuna Expressway]]. The annual [[Indian Grand Prix]] is held at the [[Buddh International Circuit]]. Roads are wide with service lanes for every major road. The sectors are named by letters of the [[Greek alphabet]]. All cabling and utilities have been built underground. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are the oldest sectors. The other emerging sectors include Xu, Delta, Mu, Omicron and Tau. The present GNIDA office is in Gamma&nbsp; II sector just opposite the historical village Rampur Jagir/Jahangir where the revolutionary [[Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil]] lived in 1919 when he was hidden underground after the [[Mainpuri]] conspiracy.

Greater Noida has a Tropical Savanna Climate with three main seasons: summer, monsoon and winter. Aside from monsoon weather, it mainly remains dry.\n\nIn summer, i.e. from March to June, the temperature ranges from a maximum of 45&nbsp;\u00b0C (i.e. 113&nbsp;\u00b0F) to a minimum of 23&nbsp;\u00b0C (73&nbsp;\u00b0F). Monsoon season prevails during mid-June to mid-September with an average rainfall of 93.2&nbsp; cm (36.7 inches). The cold waves from the Himalayan region make the winters in Greater Noida very chilly. Temperatures fall to as low as 3 to 4&nbsp;\u00b0C at the peak of winter.
