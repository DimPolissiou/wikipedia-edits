It also shares borders with [[Glasgow]], [[North Ayrshire]] and [[West Dunbartonshire]], and lies on the southern bank of the [[River Clyde]].\n\nThe term Renfrewshire may also be used to refer to the historic county, also known as the County of Renfrew or Greater Renfrewshire, with origins in the 16th century. The larger Renfrewshire, containing Renfrewshire, Inverclyde and East Renfrewshire, remains in use as a [[registration county]] and [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]] as well as a joint valuation board area for electoral registration and local tax valuation purposes.\n\nThe town of [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] is the area's main settlement and [[administrative centre|centre of local government]] and contains the historic [[county town]], the [[royal burgh]] of [[Renfrew]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of local government in Scotland}}\n[[File:Paisley abbey.jpg|thumb|Paisley Abbey]]\n\n===Toponymy===\nThe name of Renfrewshire derives from its county town, [[Renfrew]], which has been attested since the Roman occupation of Britain. The name is believed to originate from [[Common Brittonic]]/[[Cumbric]], from ren, as in [[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''rinn'', or as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''rhyn'' (a point or cape of land) and from frew, as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''fraw'', or ''ffrau'' (flow of water). This suggests a point of land near the flow of water, such as at the confluence of the Cart and Clyde rivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s1OpF1IdcgQC&dq=etymology%20of%20ren'%20frew&pg=PA222#v=onepage&q=etymology%20of%20ren'%20frew&f=false|title=Local Etymology: A Derivative Dictionary of Geographical Names|work=R.S. Charnock, London, 1859}}</ref>\n\n===Emergence as a county===\nThe [[Renfrewshire (historic)|county of Renfrew]] was established by [[Robert III of Scotland|King Robert III]] from lands centring on the ancient lordship of [[Strathgryfe]] in 1402. Previously this had formed part of the [[counties of Scotland|county]] of [[Lanarkshire]]. Previously religious authority had extended over the area through the authority of [[Paisley Abbey]] over local churches in towns and villages.\n\nFollowing the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889]], Renfrewshire - as with the other [[counties of Scotland]] - gained greater powers and became governed by an elected [[county council]], a position that remained until 1975. The centre of local government was moved from Renfrew to [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]].\n\n===Local government reform===\nIn 1973, the historic county of Renfrewshire was divided into three [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|districts]] - [[Renfrew District]], [[Inverclyde District]] and [[Eastwood District]] within the wider [[Strathclyde]] region. The modern council area of Renfrewshire was subsequently created as one of the 32 local council areas following the 1996 [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994|reform of local government in Scotland]], with altered boundaries. [[Barrhead]], [[Neilston]] and [[Uplawmoor]] which were formerly in Renfrew District joined with Eastwood District to form [[East Renfrewshire]].\n\n===Boundary dispute with Glasgow===\n\nFollowing the creation of the [[Braehead]] shopping centre  in 1999, the development formed part of a boundary dispute between Renfrewshire and the [[Politics of Glasgow|City of Glasgow]], with the centre straddling the existing boundary line. In 2002, a [[Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland|Local Government Boundary Commission]] ruling eventually redrew the boundary to include all of the centre in Renfrewshire, as this was the original ancient boundary.<ref>{{cite news|title=Glasgow MSPs lose Braehead battle|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1973915.stm|accessdate=13 June 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 May 2002}}</ref> The boundary runs along Kings Inch Drive and is marked by a chain linked fence at this point.<ref>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2002/156/article/5/made</ref>\n\n==Culture and community==\nRenfrewshire contains several places of interest. In the west of Renfrewshire, [[Castle Semple Loch]] at Lochwinnoch and the wider [[Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park]] are natural areas of interest, as is the [[Gleniffer Braes]] country park in the south.\n\nPaisley contains several historic buildings and notable sites, including [[Paisley Abbey]], Paisley Museum and Coats Observatory, Paisley Town Hall, Coats Memorial Church, Sma' Shot Cottages and [[St Mirren Park]] (home of [[St Mirren F.C.]]). Outside of Paisley, [[Elderslie]], the claimed birthplace of Scottish knight [[William Wallace]], contains a monument in his honour, while the [[Kilbarchan|Weaver's Cottage]] at [[Kilbarchan]] is in the care of the [[National Trust for Scotland]]. The town of [[Johnstone]] is notable for [[Johnstone Castle]], Johnstone High Parish Church and for containing a museum within a supermarket.\n\nThe [[Braehead Arena]] in Renfrewshire close to the boundary with [[Glasgow]] is home to leading professional [[basketball]] team, the [[Scottish Rocks]], who compete in the [[British Basketball League]]. The arena was also host to the [[2000 Ford World Curling Championships]].\n\n==Towns and villages==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Bishopton, Renfrewshire|Bishopton]]\n*[[Bridge of Weir]]\n*[[Brookfield, Renfrewshire|Brookfield]]\n*[[Crosslee]]\n*[[Elderslie]]\n*[[Erskine]]\n*[[Houston, Renfrewshire|Houston]]\n*[[Howwood, Renfrewshire|Howwood]]\n*[[Inchinnan]]\n*[[Johnstone]]\n*[[Kilbarchan]]\n*[[Langbank]]\n*[[Linwood, Renfrewshire|Linwood]]\n*[[Lochwinnoch]]\n*[[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]]\n*[[Ralston, Renfrewshire|Ralston]]\n*[[Ranfurly, Renfrewshire|Ranfurly]]\n*[[Renfrew]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Politics==\n===Renfrewshire Council===\n[[File:Renfrewshire House Building, Paisley.jpg|thumb|Renfrewshire House, headquarters of Renfrewshire Council]]\nRenfrewshire Council is the elected [[local authority]] for Renfrewshire. Its consists of 43 directly elected councillors who elect from among their number a [[Provost (civil)|Provost]] to serve as the council's [[convener]] and  ceremonial head and a [[leader of the council]] who is typically the head of the largest political group, often called the [[Political make-up of local councils in the United Kingdom|Administration]].\n\nThe council meets collectively as a full council and carries out a number of functions. Its Scheme of Delegated Functions sets out where the council has agreed to allow powers to be exercised by a committee (referred to as a \"board\" in Renfrewshire Council), a sub-committee, an officer of the council or a joint committee with one or more other councils. The council continues to reserve a number of functions that can only be carried out by the council acting as a whole.<ref>https://renfrewshire.cmis.uk.com/renfrewshire/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=Kn3WG%2BhoFvl4Xm4GunZZuefuJUUGP82LD4IThqMUZRZZZiXvA8vNRA%3D%3D&rUzwRPf%2BZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3D%3D=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2FLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3D%3D&mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=jUgQCaU3L68%3D&kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=zNDOR3JkF8E%3D&uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D</ref>\n\nThe council's paid service (known collectively as \"officers\") is headed by a chief executive, who is responsible to the elected council for the delivery of its policies.

Constituency boundaries were redrawn for the [[Scottish general election, 2011|2011 Scottish Parliament election]], with the new constituencies of [[Renfrewshire North and West (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Renfrewshire North and West]] and [[Paisley (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Paisley]] being gained by [[Derek Mackay]] and [[George Adam]], who became the first SNP parliamentarians in Renfrewshire. The remaining Labour seat, [[Renfrewshire South (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Renfrewshire South]], was gained by the SNP's [[Tom Arthur (Scottish politician)|Tom Arthur]] at the [[Scottish general election, 2016|2016 Scottish election]], with the party obtaining safe majorities in all three seats.\n\n===Referendum results===\nA majority of Renfrewshire rejected independence in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|2014 Scottish Independence referendum]], although  with 55,466 (47.2%) votes cast in favour and 62,067 (52.8%) against, the ''Yes'' vote was higher than the national result. The turnout was 117,612 or 87.3%, the highest recorded in the democratic era.\n\nWith a turnout of 69.2% (88,197), Renfrewshire voted to remain in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union membership referendum]] with 64.8% (57,119) of votes cast in favour of remaining while 35.2% (31,010) were for leaving. This was the sixth highest vote for ''Remain'' out of Scotland's 32 councils.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Paisley Grammar School - geograph.org.uk - 427193.jpg|thumb|Paisley Grammar School]]\nRenfrewshire contains the [[University of the West of Scotland]], a [[new universities|new university]] that was granted university status in 1992 as the University of Paisley. Prior to this, the Paisley Technical College and School of Art was a [[Central Institution]] or [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnic]]. In 2007 the university merged with [[Bell College]], a further education college in [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]], [[South Lanarkshire]] and the UWS name was adopted. The university today has sites across the west of Scotland, notably also in [[Ayr]] and a joint campus in [[Dumfries]]; the main campus remains in Paisley.\n\n[[Further education]] is provided by Paisley Campus of [[West College Scotland]] in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], which caters to around 20,000 students.

It also shares borders with [[Glasgow]], [[North Ayrshire]] and [[West Dunbartonshire]], and lies on the southern bank of the [[River Clyde]].\n\nThe term Renfrewshire may also be used to refer to the historic county, also known as the County of Renfrew or Greater Renfrewshire, with origins in the 16th century. The larger Renfrewshire, containing Renfrewshire, Inverclyde and East Renfrewshire, remains in use as a [[registration county]] and [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]] as well as a joint valuation board area for electoral registration and local tax valuation purposes. \n\nThe town of [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] is the area's main settlement and [[administrative centre|centre of local government]] and contains the historic [[county town]], the [[royal burgh]] of [[Renfrew]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of local government in Scotland}}\n[[File:Paisley abbey.jpg|thumb|Paisley Abbey]]\n===Toponymy===\nThe name of Renfrewshire derives from its county town, [[Renfrew]], which has been attested since the Roman occupation of Britain. The name is believed to originate from [[Common Brittonic]]/[[Cumbric]], from ren, as in [[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''rinn'', or as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''rhyn'' (a point or cape of land) and from frew, as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''fraw'', or ''ffrau'' (flow of water). This suggests a point of land near the flow of water, such as at the confluence of the Cart and Clyde rivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s1OpF1IdcgQC&dq=etymology%20of%20ren'%20frew&pg=PA222#v=onepage&q=etymology%20of%20ren'%20frew&f=false|title=Local Etymology: A Derivative Dictionary of Geographical Names|work=R.S. Charnock, London, 1859}}</ref>\n\n===Emergence as a county===\nThe [[Renfrewshire (historic)|county of Renfrew]] was established by [[Robert III of Scotland|King Robert III]] from lands centring on the ancient lordship of [[Strathgryfe]] in 1402. Previously this had formed part of the [[counties of Scotland|county]] of [[Lanarkshire]]. Previously religious authority had extended over the area through the authority of [[Paisley Abbey]] over local churches in towns and villages. \n\nFollowing the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889]], Renfrewshire - as with the other [[counties of Scotland]] - gained greater powers and became governed by an elected [[county council]], a position that remained until 1975. The centre of local government was moved from Renfrew to [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]].\n\n===Local government reform===\nIn 1973, the historic county of Renfrewshire was divided into three [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|districts]] - [[Renfrew District]], [[Inverclyde District]] and [[Eastwood District]] within the wider [[Strathclyde]] region. The modern council area of Renfrewshire was subsequently created as one of the 32 local council areas following the 1996 [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994|reform of local government in Scotland]], with altered boundaries. [[Barrhead]], [[Neilston]] and [[Uplawmoor]] which were formerly in Renfrew District joined with Eastwood District to form [[East Renfrewshire]]. \n\n===Boundary dispute with Glasgow===\n\nFollowing the creation of the [[Braehead]] shopping centre  in 1999, the development formed part of a boundary dispute between Renfrewshire and the [[Politics of Glasgow|City of Glasgow]], with the centre straddling the existing boundary line. In 2002, a [[Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland|Local Government Boundary Commission]] ruling eventually redrew the boundary to include all of the centre in Renfrewshire, as this was the original ancient boundary.<ref>{{cite news|title=Glasgow MSPs lose Braehead battle|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1973915.stm|accessdate=13 June 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 May 2002}}</ref> The boundary runs along Kings Inch Drive and is marked by a chain linked fence at this point.<ref>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2002/156/article/5/made</ref>\n\n==Culture and community==\nRenfrewshire contains several places of interest. In the west of Renfrewshire, [[Castle Semple Loch]] at Lochwinnoch and the wider [[Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park]] are natural areas of interest, as is the [[Gleniffer Braes]] country park in the south. \n\nPaisley contains several historic buildings and notable sites, including [[Paisley Abbey]], Paisley Museum and Coats Observatory, Paisley Town Hall, Coats Memorial Church, Sma' Shot Cottages and [[St Mirren Park]] (home of [[St Mirren F.C.]]). Outside of Paisley, [[Elderslie]], the claimed birthplace of Scottish knight [[William Wallace]], contains a monument in his honour, while the [[Kilbarchan|Weaver's Cottage]] at [[Kilbarchan]] is in the care of the [[National Trust for Scotland]]. The town of [[Johnstone]] is notable for [[Johnstone Castle]], Johnstone High Parish Church and for containing a museum within a supermarket.\n\nThe [[Braehead Arena]] in Renfrewshire close to the boundary with [[Glasgow]] is home to leading professional [[basketball]] team, the [[Scottish Rocks]], who compete in the [[British Basketball League]]. The arena was also host to the [[2000 Ford World Curling Championships]].\n\n==Towns and villages==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Bishopton, Renfrewshire|Bishopton]]\n*[[Bridge of Weir]]\n*[[Brookfield, Renfrewshire|Brookfield]]\n*[[Crosslee]]\n*[[Elderslie]]\n*[[Erskine]]\n*[[Houston, Renfrewshire|Houston]]\n*[[Howwood, Renfrewshire|Howwood]]\n*[[Inchinnan]]\n*[[Johnstone]]\n*[[Kilbarchan]]\n*[[Langbank]]\n*[[Linwood, Renfrewshire|Linwood]]\n*[[Lochwinnoch]]\n*[[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]]\n*[[Ralston, Renfrewshire|Ralston]]\n*[[Ranfurly, Renfrewshire|Ranfurly]]\n*[[Renfrew]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Politics==\n===Renfrewshire Council===\n[[File:Renfrewshire House Building, Paisley.jpg|thumb|Renfrewshire House, headquarters of Renfrewshire Council]]\nRenfrewshire Council is the elected [[local authority]] for Renfrewshire.

Its Scheme of Delegated Functions sets out where the council has agreed to allow powers to be exercised by a committee (referred to as a \"board\" in Renfrewshire Council), a sub-committee, an officer of the council or a joint committee with one or more other councils. The council continues to reserve a number of functions that can only be carried out by the council acting as a whole.<ref>https://renfrewshire.cmis.uk.com/renfrewshire/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=Kn3WG%2BhoFvl4Xm4GunZZuefuJUUGP82LD4IThqMUZRZZZiXvA8vNRA%3D%3D&rUzwRPf%2BZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3D%3D=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2FLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3D%3D&mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=jUgQCaU3L68%3D&kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=zNDOR3JkF8E%3D&uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D</ref>\n\nThe council's paid service (known collectively as \"officers\") is headed by a chief executive, who is responsible to the elected council for the delivery of its policies.

The remaining Labour seat, [[Renfrewshire South (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Renfrewshire South]], was gained by the SNP's [[Tom Arthur (Scottish politician)|Tom Arthur]] at the [[Scottish general election, 2016|2016 Scottish election]], with the party obtaining safe majorities in all three seats.\n\n===Referendum results===\nA majority of Renfrewshire rejected independence in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|2014 Scottish Independence referendum]], although  with 55,466 (47.2%) votes cast in favour and 62,067 (52.8%) against, the ''Yes'' vote was higher than the national result. The turnout was 117,612 or 87.3%, the highest recorded in the democratic era. \n\nWith a turnout of 69.2% (88,197), Renfrewshire voted to remain in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union membership referendum]] with 64.8% (57,119) of votes cast in favour of remaining while 35.2% (31,010) were for leaving.

The film stars [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]], [[Nick Robinson (American actor)|Nick Robinson]], [[Ron Livingston]], [[Maggie Siff]], [[Alex Roe]], [[Maria Bello]], [[Maika Monroe]], and [[Liev Schreiber]].\n\nDevelopment began in March 2012, when [[Columbia Pictures|Sony]] picked up the film rights to [[The 5th Wave (series)|the trilogy of novels]], with [[Graham King]]'s production company [[GK Films]] and [[Tobey Maguire]]'s Material Pictures. Filming took place in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] from October 2014 to January 2015. ''The 5th Wave'' was released on January 22, 2016, in the United States by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It grossed $109 million worldwide against a $54 million budget, and received generally unfavorable reviews from critics for the CGI, storyline, and screenplay.<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should be 400-700 words long.-->\nOhio high-schooler [[Cassie Sullivan]], armed with an [[M4 carbine]], emerges from the woods to raid an abandoned [[gas station]]. Upon entering, she hears a male voice calling for help. She finds a wounded man, who points a gun at her, but they ask each put their weapons down. His other hand is under his jacket and as he takes it out, she sees a glint of metal and kills him thinking he was holding a gun, but he was holding a [[Christian cross]] and the screen cuts to black to show her [[backstory]].\n\nA colossal alien spaceship is circling Earth, guided by extraterrestrials referred to as \"The Others\". Ten days later, The Others unleash their 1st Wave, an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that permanently disables all electrical power grids worldwide. The 2nd Wave has The Others manipulate<!--- the method is not explained in the film, but in the novel --> the planet's geology and fault lines, causing [[earthquakes]] and [[megatsunamis]] that destroy coastal cities and islands, including [[Hallandale Beach]], [[London]], [[Thailand]], and [[New York City|New York]]. For the 3rd Wave, The Others modify a strain of [[Avian influenza|avian flu virus]] and spread it across the planet with birds. The population is decimated, with Cassie's mother being one of the casualties.\n\nCassie, her father and her younger brother Sam find a summer camp in use as a refuge in the woods with roughly 300 survivors. A few days later, an Army unit with working vehicles rolls into the camp. The unit's commander, Colonel Vosch, claims there is an imminent threat of a 4th Wave and they will take the children to safety at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], intending to bring the buses back to retrieve the adults. Cassie is separated from Sam, and witnesses the Army massacring all the adults, her father included. Cassie scavenges her way toward the base, but is shot in the leg by a sniper and passes out. About a week later, she wakes up in the farmhouse of a young man named Evan Walker, who saved her. Cassie leaves towards the base with Evan, but learns that he is an Other, sent years ago as a sleeper agent and merged his consciousness into a human host. The sleepers roam their designated zones, killing human survivors. Evan admits his humanity was reactivated when he saw her, disagrees with the invasion and lets her leave. He warns that Colonel Vosch and the military are possessed by the consciousness of individual Others.\n\nAt the base, the military have used deception and technology to convince the rescued children that the humans outside the base have been possessed. They provide military training to the children, forming them into squads to go on kill missions outside the base. Sam has been placed into a squad led by Ben, a boy Cassie had a crush on, along with Ringer, a tough teenage girl, Dumbo and Teacup. While out on a kill mission, Ringer removes her military implant, causing her to register as an Other-possessed human on the squad's scopes. The squad deduces the plan to have them kill real unpossessed humans, making them the 5th Wave. Ben sends his squad into the woods and returns to base, claiming his squad was killed, for the purpose of retrieving Sam, who was left behind. Ben confronts Colonel Vosch about child warriors being the 5th Wave and Cassie kills Sergeant Reznik during her one-on-one indoctrination spiel. Ben and Cassie find each other and leave to find Sam. Evan sets off numerous bombs and advises them to quickly find Sam before the destruction of the entire facility. Colonel Vosch and the surviving military Others evacuate with the human children by military aircraft. Cassie, Ben and Sam escape, with help from Ringer, just as Evan completes the destruction of the base. Ben's squad is reunited, and Cassie ponders the strength of hope as humanity's driving force for survival.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- star billing, in main \"Closing Credits\" order, with roles per secondary

The film stars [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]], [[Nick Robinson (American actor)|Nick Robinson]], [[Ron Livingston]], [[Maggie Siff]], [[Alex Roe]], [[Maria Bello]], [[Maika Monroe]], and [[Liev Schreiber]].\n\nDevelopment began in March 2012, when [[Columbia Pictures|Sony]] picked up the film rights to [[The 5th Wave (series)|the trilogy of novels]], with [[Graham King]]'s production company [[GK Films]] and [[Tobey Maguire]]'s Material Pictures. Filming took place in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] from October 2014 to January 2015. ''The 5th Wave'' was released on January 22, 2016, in the United States by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It grossed $109 million worldwide against a $54 million budget, and received generally unfavorable reviews from critics for the CGI, storyline, and screenplay.<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should be 400-700 words long.-->\nOhio high-schooler [[Cassie Sullivan]], armed with an [[M4 carbine]], emerges from the woods to raid an abandoned [[gas station]]. Upon entering, she hears a male voice calling for help. She finds a wounded man, who points a gun at her, but they ask each put their weapons down. His other hand is under his jacket and as he takes it out, she sees a glint of metal and kills him thinking he was holding a gun, but he was holding a [[Christian cross]] and the screen cuts to black to show her [[backstory]].\n\nA colossal alien spaceship is circling Earth, guided by extraterrestrials referred to as \"The Others\". Ten days later, The Others unleash their 1st Wave, an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that permanently disables all electrical power grids worldwide. The 2nd Wave has The Others manipulate<!--- the method is not explained in the film, but in the novel --> the planet's geology and fault lines, causing [[earthquakes]] and [[megatsunamis]] that destroy coastal cities and islands, including [[Hallandale Beach]], [[London]], [[Thailand]], and [[New York City|New York]]. For the 3rd Wave, The Others modify a strain of [[Avian influenza|avian flu virus]] and spread it across the planet with birds. The population is decimated, with Cassie's mother being one of the casualties.\n\nCassie, her father and her younger brother Sam find a summer camp in use as a refuge in the woods with roughly 300 survivors. A few days later, an Army unit with working vehicles rolls into the camp. The unit's commander, Colonel Vosch, claims there is an imminent threat of a 4th Wave and they will take the children to safety at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], intending to bring the buses back to retrieve the adults. Cassie is separated from Sam, and witnesses the Army massacring all the adults, her father included. Cassie scavenges her way toward the base, but is shot in the leg by a sniper and passes out. About a week later, she wakes up in the farmhouse of a young man named Evan Walker, who saved her. Cassie leaves towards the base with Evan, but learns that he is an Other, sent years ago as a sleeper agent and merged his consciousness into a human host. The sleepers roam their designated zones, killing human survivors. Evan admits his humanity was reactivated when he saw her, disagrees with the invasion and lets her leave. He warns that Colonel Vosch and the military are possessed by the consciousness of individual Others.\n\nAt the base, the military have used deception and technology to convince the rescued children that the humans outside the base have been possessed. They provide military training to the children, forming them into squads to go on kill missions outside the base. Sam has been placed into a squad led by Ben, a boy Cassie had a crush on, along with Ringer, a tough teenage girl, Dumbo and Teacup. While out on a kill mission, Ringer removes her military implant, causing her to register as an Other-possessed human on the squad's scopes. The squad deduces the plan to have them kill real unpossessed humans, making them the 5th Wave. Ben sends his squad into the woods and returns to base, claiming his squad was killed, for the purpose of retrieving Sam, who was left behind. Ben confronts Colonel Vosch about child warriors being the 5th Wave and Cassie kills Sergeant Reznik during her one-on-one indoctrination spiel. Ben and Cassie find each other and leave to find Sam. Evan sets off numerous bombs and advises them to quickly find Sam before the destruction of the entire facility. Colonel Vosch and the surviving military Others evacuate with the human children by military aircraft. Cassie, Ben and Sam escape, with help from Ringer, just as Evan completes the destruction of the base. Ben's squad is reunited, and Cassie ponders the strength of hope as humanity's driving force for survival.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- star billing, in main \"Closing Credits\" order, with roles per secondary

Artist [[Tony Hart]] and actress Ann Taylor both presented the show either in place of either Trace or Williams, or sometimes in place of both, with Taylor replacing Williams for six weeks in 1959 and presenting the show at least once alone, as did Hart.<ref name=\"Book\">{{cite book |last1=Marson |first1=Richard |title=\"Blue Peter\" 50th Anniversary Book: The Story of Television's Longest-running Children's Programme |date=21 September 2008 |publisher=[[Hamlyn (publishers)|Hamlyn]] |isbn=978-0-600-61793-8 }}</ref> When Williams was fired from the show in 1962 following a series of spats with a newly appointed producer, Trace continued to present the show alone or with one-off presenters until a replacement was found.
