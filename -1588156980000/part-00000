In [[Chemical biology|Chemical Biology]] he has elucidated the [[stereochemistry]] of numerous enzyme-catalysed phosphoryl and nucleotidyl transfer reactions using isotopically chiral substrates and DNA fragments. He has applied [[organic synthesis]] techniques in novel ways using carbohydrate, cyclitol and phosphorus chemistry to design modulators of cellular signal transduction processes that mobilize intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> through second messengers. Of particular relevance to this Academy he has pioneered the novel aryl sulfamate pharmacophore in drug design. Unusually within an academic setting, he has brought compounds from initial academic concept to multiple [[clinical trial]]s in women\u2019s health. These have shown evidence of efficacy in humans, particularly in the anti-cancer field related to hormone-dependent breast cancer\u201d.\n\nHe was elected a Member (MAE) of the pan-European Academy of Science, Humanities & Letters the ''[[Academia Europaea]]''  in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ae-info.org/ae/Acad_Main/List_of_Members/ListMembersBySection?type=listsection&pagenr=800|title=Academy of Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Chemical Sciences Section|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nHe has also won a number of academic and industrial awards and medals e.g.: [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], 2007 UCB-Celltech Industrially Sponsored Award & Medal  for Chemical Biology;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/Archive/ChemicalBiology/Index.asp|title=Chemical Biology Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal Society of Chemistry|access-date=}}</ref> [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], 2007/8 George and Christine Sosnovsky Award & Medal in Cancer Therapy;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/Sosnovsky/winners.asp|title=The George and Christine Sosnovsky Award in Cancer Therapy Award Previous Winners|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal Society of Chemistry|access-date=}}</ref> 2009 [[GlaxoSmithKline]] International Achievement Award;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2009|title=Discovery of steroid sulphatase inhibitors recognised with GSK award|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news/discovery-of-steroid-sulphatase-inhibitors-recognised-with-gsk-award/10977876.article|journal=The Pharmaceutical Journal|volume=283|pages=295|via=URI: 10977876}}</ref> [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], Biological & Medicinal Chemistry Section, 2009 Malcolm Campbell Memorial Prize & Medal (jointly);<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/Membership/Networking/InterestGroups/BMCS/Activities/CampbellAward.asp|title=Malcolm Campbell Memorial Award,  Previous Winners|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal Society of Chemistry|access-date=}}</ref>  [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] 2010 [[Interdisciplinary Prizes (RSC)|Interdisciplinary Prize]] & Medal;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/InterdisciplinaryPrize/2010winner2.asp|title=Interdisciplinary Prize 2010 Winner|last=|first=|date=2010|website=Royal Society of Chemistry|access-date=}}</ref> 2012 European Life Science Award, Investigator of the Year;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifescienceawards.com/|title=European Life Science Awards, 2012 Winners, Invesitgator of the Year |last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], Biological & Medicinal Chemistry Section, 2015/16 2nd RSC-BMCS Lectureship;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/Membership/Networking/InterestGroups/BMCS/Activities/BMCS_lectureship.asp|title=BMCS Lectureship |last=|first= |date=2015\u20132016 |website=Royal Society of Chemistry |access-date=}}</ref> 2018 Tu Youyou Award for Natural Product and Medicinal Chemistry.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Tu Youyou Award|journal=Molecules|volume=23|issue=7|pages=1651|doi=10.3390/molecules23071651 |pmid=29986395 |pmc=6099563 |date=2018 |last1=McPhee |first1=Derek}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Potter, Barry V.

In [[Chemical biology|Chemical Biology]] he has elucidated the [[stereochemistry]] of numerous enzyme-catalysed phosphoryl and nucleotidyl transfer reactions using isotopically chiral substrates and DNA fragments. He has applied [[organic synthesis]] techniques in novel ways using carbohydrate, cyclitol and phosphorus chemistry to design modulators of cellular signal transduction processes that mobilize intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> through second messengers. Of particular relevance to this Academy he has pioneered the novel aryl sulfamate pharmacophore in drug design. Unusually within an academic setting, he has brought compounds from initial academic concept to multiple [[clinical trial]]s in women\u2019s health. These have shown evidence of efficacy in humans, particularly in the anti-cancer field related to hormone-dependent breast cancer\u201d.\n\nHe was elected a Member (MAE) of the pan-European Academy of Science, Humanities & Letters the ''[[Academia Europaea]]''  in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ae-info.org/ae/Acad_Main/List_of_Members/ListMembersBySection?type=listsection&pagenr=800|title=Academy of Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Chemical Sciences Section|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nHe has also won a number of academic and industrial awards and medals e.g.: [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], 2007 UCB-Celltech Industrially Sponsored Award & Medal  for Chemical Biology;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/Archive/ChemicalBiology/Index.asp|title=Chemical Biology Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal Society of Chemistry|access-date=}}</ref> [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], 2007/8 George and Christine Sosnovsky Award & Medal in Cancer Therapy;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/Sosnovsky/winners.asp|title=The George and Christine Sosnovsky Award in Cancer Therapy Award Previous Winners|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal Society of Chemistry|access-date=}}</ref> 2009 [[GlaxoSmithKline]] International Achievement Award;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2009|title=Discovery of steroid sulphatase inhibitors recognised with GSK award|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news/discovery-of-steroid-sulphatase-inhibitors-recognised-with-gsk-award/10977876.article|journal=The Pharmaceutical Journal|volume=283|pages=295|via=URI: 10977876}}</ref> [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], Biological & Medicinal Chemistry Section, 2009 Malcolm Campbell Memorial Prize & Medal (jointly);<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/Membership/Networking/InterestGroups/BMCS/Activities/CampbellAward.asp|title=Malcolm Campbell Memorial Award,  Previous Winners|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal Society of Chemistry|access-date=}}</ref>  [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] 2010 [[Interdisciplinary Prizes (RSC)|Interdisciplinary Prize]] & Medal;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/InterdisciplinaryPrize/2010winner2.asp|title=Interdisciplinary Prize 2010 Winner|last=|first=|date=2010|website=Royal Society of Chemistry|access-date=}}</ref> 2012 European Life Science Award, Investigator of the Year;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifescienceawards.com/|title=European Life Science Awards, 2012 Winners, Invesitgator of the Year |last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], Biological & Medicinal Chemistry Section, 2015/16 2nd RSC-BMCS Lectureship;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/Membership/Networking/InterestGroups/BMCS/Activities/BMCS_lectureship.asp|title=BMCS Lectureship |last=|first= |date=2015\u20132016 |website=Royal Society of Chemistry |access-date=}}</ref> 2018 Tu Youyou Award for Natural Product and Medicinal Chemistry.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Tu Youyou Award|journal=Molecules|volume=23|issue=7|pages=1651|doi=10.3390/molecules23071651 |pmid=29986395 |pmc=6099563 |date=2018 |last1=McPhee |first1=Derek}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Potter, Barry V.

She grew up without electricity or plumbing. Her grandmother traded one of the family's milk cows for a neighbor's piano, and at the age of seven, Gentry composed her first song, \"My Dog Sergeant Is a Good Dog.\" Gentry lived in [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], with her father for a few years{{Vague|date=February 2020}} and learned to play the guitar and banjo.\n\nAt age thirteen, Gentry moved to [[Palm Springs, California]], to live with her then-remarried mother. They performed as a duo, Ruby and Bobbie Meyers, for a short time. Gentry took her stage name from the 1952 film ''[[Ruby Gentry]]'' which she had seen on television. In the film, Ruby (played by [[Jennifer Jones]]) was a poor but beautiful girl from the backwoods who ended up marrying the town tycoon.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Gentry moved to Los Angeles to enter [[UCLA]] as a philosophy major. She supported herself with clerical jobs, occasionally performing at nightclubs and country clubs, and was encouraged{{Explain|reason=Encouraged in what way?|date=February 2020}} by [[Bob Hope]] while performing in a revue at Les Folies Bergeres nightclub of [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. She worked as a fashion model, and on June 29, 1962, [[United Press International]] circulated a [[wire photo]] of Gentry that included [[Cheryl Crane]], daughter of [[Lana Turner]].<ref>[http://333sound.com/2014/12/03/bobbie-gentry-week-day-3-behind-the-photograph-of-bobbie-gentry-and-cheryl-crane/ Photo dated 6/29/1962] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218193927/http://333sound.com/2014/12/03/bobbie-gentry-week-day-3-behind-the-photograph-of-bobbie-gentry-and-cheryl-crane/ |date=December 18, 2014 }}, [[United Press International]] (photographer uncredited).

While attending a [[Jody Reynolds]] concert at a club in Palm Springs in 1966, Gentry asked if she could sit in on one of Reynold's recording session. This led to an invitation to sing on two duets with Reynolds: \"Stranger in the Mirror\" and \"Requiem for Love\". The two songs were released in September 1966 by Titan Records, but failed to chart.\n\n==Career==\n===1967: ''Ode to Billie Joe''===\nGentry recorded a 12-song demo at Whitney Recording Studio in Glendale, California, in February and March 1967. Her sole ambition originally was to write songs to sell to other artists, telling ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that she only sang on the recording of \"Ode to Billie Joe\" that she took to Capitol because it was cheaper than hiring someone to sing it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Murtha |first1=Tara |title=Ode to Billie Joe |date=2015 |publisher=Blumsbury |location=New York |isbn=978-1-6235-6964-8 |page=58}}</ref>\n\nGentry signed with Capitol Records on June 23, 1967, and staff producer [[Kelly Gordon]] was given ''[[Ode to Billie Joe (album)|Ode to Billie Joe]]'' as his first full-length album production for the label. All of Gentry's \"demo\" tracks became the album masters. It was \"Mississippi Delta\" that initially got Gentry signed and was intended to be the A-side of her first single. In retrospect, the track is more obviously commercial than \"Ode to Billie Joe\" and reflects what was on the charts at the time. Gentry's original demo of \"Mississippi Delta\" was the version issued, but \"Ode to Billie Joe\" had a string arrangement by [[Jimmie Haskell]] dubbed onto the original recording at Capitol. It was the day after the string session that Capitol's A&R team decided that \"Ode to Billie Joe\" would be the A-side.<ref name=\"Ode To Billie Joe \u2013 Bobbie Gentry\">{{cite web |title=Ode To Billie Joe \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/ode-to-billie-joe/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The single was released on July 10, 1967. It would spend four weeks at number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]] and placed number four on the year-end chart. The single reached number eight on the ''Billboard'' Black Singles chart and number 13 on the UK Top 40.<ref name=everyhit /> It sold more than three million copies worldwide.<ref name=am /> In 2001, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine listed \"Ode to Billie Joe\" among ''[[the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]''.\n\nFollowing the single's success, the rest of the album was quickly assembled from the 12 demos Gentry recorded, with overdubs completed in a matter of days. The result was a unique combination of blues, folk and jazz elements, that furthered Gentry's recollections of her home, and felt more like a concept album than a hastily assembled collection of songs. Capitol pre-ordered 500,000 copies \u2013 the largest pressing of a debut album in the label's history at that point. The album was in stores within a month of pressing, on August 21.<ref name=\"Ode To Billie Joe \u2013 Bobbie Gentry\"/> ''Ode to Billie Joe'' replaced [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' at the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and reached No.&nbsp;5 on the ''Billboard'' Black Albums chart. Gentry won three [[Grammy Awards]] in 1967, including ''Best New Artist'' and ''Best Female Pop Vocal Performance''. She was also named the [[Academy of Country Music]]'s Most Promising Female Vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acmcountry.com/winners|title=ACM Winners \u2013 Academy of Country Music|author=BubbleUp, LTD.|work=Academy of Country Music}}</ref>\n\n===1968: ''The Delta Sweete'', ''Local Gentry'' and Glen Campbell===\nIn February 1968, Gentry took part in the [[Festival della canzone italiana|Italian Song Festival in Sanremo]] competition as one of two performers of the song \"La Siepe\" by [[Vito Pallavicini]] and Massara. her version placed ninth.<ref name=hitparade>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/sanremo/edizioni/1968.htm|title=Sanremo 1968|publisher=HitParadeItalia.it}}</ref> Capitol released the song concurrently as a single backed by another Italian song recorded by Gentry, \"La Citt\u00e0 \u00e8 Grande\" by Pallavicini and De Ponti.<ref>{{cite web |title=La Siepe (The Hedge) \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/la-siepe/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=February 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nGentry's second album, ''[[The Delta Sweete]]'', was released in February 1968. The album represented a definite step forward from her debut in its musical ambition. The concept album drew inspiration from Gentry's Mississippi delta roots. Most of the album's sound comes from Gentry, who played almost every instrument on the album, including piano, guitar, banjo, bass and vibes. Producing credit, however, went to Capitol's in-house producer, Kelly Gordon. The album earned Gentry two more entries on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"Okolona River Bottom Band\" peaked at number 54, while her cover of \"Louisiana Man\" made it to number 100. Although the album failed to match the success of its predecessor, only reaching number 132 on the ''Billboard'' 200, critics have called it one of the unsung masterpieces of the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Delta Sweete \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/the-delta-sweete/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk/ |accessdate=February 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nGentry's performances on- and off-screen impressed the head of the BBC so much that in 1968 she was asked to host a variety show on BBC 2, making her the first female songwriter to host a series on the network. With help from producer Stanley Dorfman, Gentry made six half-hour episodes that aired weekly from July 13 to August 17. Dorfman told author Tara Murtha, \"After a few episodes, she was pretty much co-directing the show because she had such great ideas. [But] the BBC wouldn't have it, wouldn't have an artist credited as a director or producer, so the credit went to me as producer and director. But she definitely contributed as much as I did creatively to the show. She was just full of ideas.\"<ref name=\"UKBio\">{{cite web |title=Biography \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/biography/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFollowing ''The Delta Sweete'', Capitol released Gentry's third album, ''[[Local Gentry]]'', in August 1968. The album failed to appear on any of the ''Billboard'' album charts, but did peak at number 83 on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' Top 100 Albums chart.<ref>{{cite web |title=Local Gentry \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/local-gentry/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk/ |accessdate=February 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nGentry's third album of 1968 came in September, one month after ''Local Gentry''. ''[[Bobbie Gentry and Glen Campbell]]'' is an album of duets with label mate [[Glen Campbell]]. Their chemistry made the partnership a great success. The album peaked at number 11 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard 200|Top LP's]] chart and number one on the [[Top Country Albums|Top Country LP's]] chart. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA and earned Gentry and Campbell the [[Academy of Country Music]] award for Album of the Year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bobbie Gentry and Glen Campbell \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/bobbie-gentry-and-glen-campbell/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=February 10, 2020}}</ref> Gentry was also nominated for Top Female Vocalist.\n\n===1969: ''Touch 'Em with Love''===\nGentry produced a second series of shows for BCC 2 in 1969 which aired weekly from June 18 to July 23.\n\nGentry's fifth album, ''[[Touch 'Em with Love]]'', was released in July 1969. It marked a transition in her career, the album featured fewer self-penned regional song and more systematically chosen cover songs in an attempt to re-brand Gentry as a blue-eyed soul singer. Only two of the album's ten tracks were originals. The album was recorded in Nashville and produced by Kelso Herston. The album's title track was released as the first single and it failed to go any higher than number 113 on ''Billboard'''s [[Bubbling Under the Hot 100]] chart. The album fared no better, only reaching number 164 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Gentry's cover of \"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]\" was released as the second single in the UK where it became a number one hit on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The album reached number 21 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Touch \u2018Em with Love \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/touch-em-with-love/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Gentry taped four television specials for Canadian television station CFTO for North American syndication.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/43253837/|title=The Ottawa Journal from Ottawa,  \u00b7 Page 82|via=Newspapers.com|accessdate=October 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1970: ''Fancy''===\nApril 1970 saw the release of ''[[Fancy (Bobbie Gentry album)|Fancy]]'', Gentry's sixth album in three years. Like 1969's ''Touch 'Em with Love'', it is made up entirely of covers, except for the self-penned title track. The majority of the album was record at [[FAME Studios|Fame Recording Studios]] in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, with producer [[Rick Hall]]. \"[[Fancy (Bobbie Gentry song)|Fancy]]\" was released as the album's first single and was Gentry's biggest hit since \"Ode to Billie Joe\", peaking within the top 40 in the US, Canada and Australia. Born \"poor white trash,\" the beautiful Fancy is groomed to be a hooker by her impoverished sickly mother. In the end Fancy ends up with an \"elegant Georgia mansion\" and \"a New York townhouse flat\"\u2014no shame and no regrets. Of the song Gentry herself said, \"Fancy is my strongest statement for women's lib, if you really listen to it. I agree wholeheartedly with that movement and all the serious issues that [it stands] for\u2014equality, equal pay, day care centers, and abortion rights,\" she explained to After Dark magazine in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fancy \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/fancy/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe album's first European single, a cover of \"[[Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head]]\", peaked at number 40. The album's second North American single, \"He Made a Woman Out of Me\", did not reach the same heights as \"Fancy\", peaking at only number 71 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\nThe album would be nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Female]] at the [[13th Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\n===1971\u20131974: ''Patchwork'' and departure from Capitol===\nIn early 1971, Gentry produced a third and final series of shows for BBC 2. This third series again consisted of six episodes and aired weekly from February 1 to March 15.\n\nGentry released ''[[Patchwork (album)|Patchwork]]'' in April 1971. It has been described as a collection of short stories in song ranging from country to pop to blues, all stitched together with cinematic interludes to make a cohesive whole. ''Patchwork'' was Gentry's first album to be entirely self-written and produced. The album's first single was a small hit, peaking at number 37 on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Top 40 Easy Listening]] chart and number 93 in Canada. On the album's closing track, \"Lookin' In\", Gentry seems to be singing about herself.  \"I'm packing up and checking out,\" she sings. \"I just can't bring myself to compromise.\" It seems to be Gentry offering a commentary on her decision to leave her recording career behind for Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Patchwork \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/patchwork/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=February 10, 2020}}</ref> Gentry would release one more single for Capitol in August 1972, \"The Girl from Cincinnati\".\n\nAround the time ''Patchwork'' was released, the entire executive board that had been at Capitol throughout Gentry's career was fired. A major restructuring at Capitol took place as parent company EMI tried to seize back control and rekindle the label's dwindling profits. This saw the artist roster slashed from 247 to 81 alongside extensive cuts to production and marketing budgets. With none of the executive board left that had known and worked with her, negotiations stalled over the renewal terms of Gentry's contract, and this failure to reach an agreement with Capitol created a stalemate. Since Gentry was unwilling to release an album with Capitol on the terms offered, she found herself unable to release an album on another label, meaning she was left with no choice but to wait out the remaining option period of her contract.\n\nIn 1974, she hosted a summer replacement variety show on [[CBS]] called ''The Bobbie Gentry Happiness Hour''. The show, which was her version of Glen Campbell's hit series ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', was not renewed for a full season.\n\n===1975\u20131977: Post-Capitol recordings===\nIn 1975, Gentry wrote and performed \"Another Place, Another Time\" for writer-director [[Max Baer, Jr.]]'s film ''[[Macon County Line]]''. Following the film's success the song was released on a promotional [[7\" single]]. In 1976, Baer directed the feature film ''[[Ode to Billy Joe (film)|Ode to Billy Joe]]'', based on Gentry's hit song<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074995/ Ode to Billy Joe] International Movie Database</ref> and starring [[Robby Benson]] and [[Glynnis O'Connor]]. In the movie, the mystery of the title character's suicide is revealed as a part of the conflict between his love for Bobbie Lee Hartley and a drunken homosexual experience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ode-to-billy-joe-1976|title=Ode to Billy Joe movie review (1976) &#124; Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.com|accessdate=October 11, 2019}}</ref> [[Warner Bros. Records]] released a soundtrack of the score by Michel Legrand, including a re-recorded version of \"Ode to Billie Joe\", re-titled \"Ode to Billy Joe\" to match the film's title, with Gentry stating that the original spelling was an error. Warner Bros. released the new version as a single and Capitol released the original version, which gave Gentry two concurrent chart placings with the same song. The re-recording would go on to be Gentry's last single to chart, meaning that her first and last chart entries are the same song.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ode to Billy Joe (Soundtrack re-recording) \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/ode-to-billy-joe-soundtrack-re-recording/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nGentry recorded an album with producer Rick Hall for the [[Curb Records]] division of Warner Bros. Records in 1977. The first single, \"Steal Away\", was released in February 1978 and failed to chart. The full-length album was never released. Four additional tracks from these sessions have been released: \"He Did Me Wrong, But He Did It Right\" was released as the B-side of \"Steal Away\" in 1978, while \"Slow Cookin'\", \"Sweet Country\", and \"Thunder in the Afternoon\" were released on the European compilation album, ''Ode to Billie Joe'' in 1992.\n\n===1978\u20131982: Final performance and appearances===\nGentry appeared as a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' on Christmas Day 1978.\n\nShe attended the Best of Vegas Awards on March 21, 1980.\n\nOn May 10, 1981, Gentry was one of many celebrity guests to take part in ''An All-Star Salute to Mother's Day''. During the television special she performed \"Mama, a Rainbow\" from the musical ''Minnie's Boys'' for her mother who was seated in the audience. This would prove to be Gentry's final public performance.<ref name=\"imdb2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0313160/|title=Bobbie Gentry|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=October 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGentry's final public appearance came almost one year later when she attended the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] on April 30, 1982, she was 40 years old. \n\nSince that time, she has not recorded, performed or been interviewed.

She grew up without electricity or plumbing. Her grandmother traded one of the family's milk cows for a neighbor's piano, and at the age of seven, Gentry composed her first song, \"My Dog Sergeant Is a Good Dog.\" Gentry lived in [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], with her father for a few years{{Vague|date=February 2020}} and learned to play the guitar and banjo.\n\nAt age thirteen, Gentry moved to [[Palm Springs, California]], to live with her then-remarried mother. They performed as a duo, Ruby and Bobbie Meyers, for a short time. Gentry took her stage name from the 1952 film ''[[Ruby Gentry]]'' which she had seen on television. In the film, Ruby (played by [[Jennifer Jones]]) was a poor but beautiful girl from the backwoods who ended up marrying the town tycoon.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Gentry moved to Los Angeles to enter [[UCLA]] as a philosophy major. She supported herself with clerical jobs, occasionally performing at nightclubs and country clubs, and was encouraged{{Explain|reason=Encouraged in what way?|date=February 2020}} by [[Bob Hope]] while performing in a revue at Les Folies Bergeres nightclub of [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]].

While attending a [[Jody Reynolds]] concert at a club in Palm Springs in 1966, Gentry asked if she could sit in on one of Reynold's recording session. This led to an invitation to sing on two duets with Reynolds: \"Stranger in the Mirror\" and \"Requiem for Love\". The two songs were released in September 1966 by Titan Records, but failed to chart.\n\n==Career==\n===1967: ''Ode to Billie Joe''===\nGentry recorded a 12-song demo at Whitney Recording Studio in Glendale, California, in February and March 1967. Her sole ambition originally was to write songs to sell to other artists, telling the [[Washington Post]] that she only sang on the recording of \"Ode to Billie Joe\" that she took to Capitol because it was cheaper than hiring someone to sing it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Murtha |first1=Tara |title=Ode to Billie Joe |date=2015 |publisher=Blumsbury |location=New York |isbn=978-1-6235-6964-8 |page=58}}</ref>\n\nGentry signed with Capitol Records on June 23, 1967, and staff producer [[Kelly Gordon]] was given ''[[Ode to Billie Joe (album)|Ode to Billie Joe]]'' as his first full-length album production for the label. All of Gentry's \"demo\" tracks became the album masters. It was \"Mississippi Delta\" that initially got Gentry signed and was intended to be the A-side of her first single. In retrospect, the track is more obviously commercial than \"Ode to Billie Joe\" and reflects what was on the charts at the time. Gentry's original demo of \"Mississippi Delta\" was the version issued, but \"Ode to Billie Joe\" had a string arrangement by [[Jimmie Haskell]] dubbed onto the original recording at Capitol. It was the day after the string session that Capitol's A&R team decided that \"Ode to Billie Joe\" would be the A-side.<ref name=\"Ode To Billie Joe \u2013 Bobbie Gentry\">{{cite web |title=Ode To Billie Joe \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/ode-to-billie-joe/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The single was released on July 10, 1967. It would spend four weeks at number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]] and placed number four on the year-end chart. The single reached number eight on the ''Billboard'' Black Singles chart and number 13 on the UK Top 40.<ref name=everyhit /> It sold more than three million copies worldwide.<ref name=am /> In 2001, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine listed \"Ode to Billie Joe\" among ''[[the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]''.\n\nFollowing the single's success, the rest of the album was quickly assembled from the 12 demos Gentry recorded, with overdubs completed in a matter of days. The result was a unique combination of blues, folk and jazz elements, that furthered Gentry's recollections of her home, and felt more like a concept album than a hastily assembled collection of songs. Capitol pre-ordered 500,000 copies \u2013 the largest pressing of a debut album in the label's history at that point. The album was in stores within a month of pressing, on August 21.<ref name=\"Ode To Billie Joe \u2013 Bobbie Gentry\"/> ''Ode to Billie Joe'' replaced [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' at the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and reached No.&nbsp;5 on the ''Billboard'' Black Albums chart. Gentry won three [[Grammy Awards]] in 1967, including ''Best New Artist'' and ''Best Female Pop Vocal Performance''. She was also named the [[Academy of Country Music]]'s Most Promising Female Vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acmcountry.com/winners|title=ACM Winners \u2013 Academy of Country Music|author=BubbleUp, LTD.|work=Academy of Country Music}}</ref>\n\n===1968: ''The Delta Sweete'', ''Local Gentry'' and Glen Campbell===\nIn February 1968, Gentry took part in the [[Festival della canzone italiana|Italian Song Festival in Sanremo]] competition as one of two performers of the song \"La Siepe\" by [[Vito Pallavicini]] and Massara. her version placed ninth.<ref name=hitparade>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitparadeitalia.it/sanremo/edizioni/1968.htm|title=Sanremo 1968|publisher=HitParadeItalia.it}}</ref> Capitol released the song concurrently as a single backed by another Italian song recorded by Gentry, \"La Citt\u00e0 \u00e8 Grande\" by Pallavicini and De Ponti.<ref>{{cite web |title=La Siepe (The Hedge) \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/la-siepe/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=February 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nGentry's second album, ''[[The Delta Sweete]]'', was released in February 1968. The album represented a definite step forward from her debut in its musical ambition. The concept album drew inspiration from Gentry's Mississippi delta roots. Most of the album's sound comes from Gentry, who played almost every instrument on the album, including piano, guitar, banjo, bass and vibes. Producing credit, however, went to Capitol's in-house producer, Kelly Gordon. The album earned Gentry two more entries on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"Okolona River Bottom Band\" peaked at number 54, while her cover of \"Louisiana Man\" made it to number 100. Although the album failed to match the success of its predecessor, only reaching number 132 on the ''Billboard'' 200, critics have called it one of the unsung masterpieces of the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Delta Sweete \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/the-delta-sweete/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk/ |accessdate=February 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nGentry's performances on- and off-screen impressed the head of the BBC so much that in 1968 she was asked to host a variety show on BBC 2, making her the first female songwriter to host a series on the network. With help from producer Stanley Dorfman, Gentry made six half-hour episodes that aired weekly from July 13 to August 17. Dorfman told author Tara Murtha, \"After a few episodes, she was pretty much co-directing the show because she had such great ideas. [But] the BBC wouldn't have it, wouldn't have an artist credited as a director or producer, so the credit went to me as producer and director. But she definitely contributed as much as I did creatively to the show. She was just full of ideas.\"<ref name=\"UKBio\">{{cite web |title=Biography \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/biography/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFollowing ''The Delta Sweete'', Capitol released Gentry's third album, ''[[Local Gentry]]'', in August 1968. The album failed to appear on any of the ''Billboard'' album charts, but did peak at number 83 on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' Top 100 Albums chart.<ref>{{cite web |title=Local Gentry \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/local-gentry/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk/ |accessdate=February 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nGentry's third album of 1968 came in September, one month after ''Local Gentry''. ''[[Bobbie Gentry and Glen Campbell]]'' is an album of duets with label mate [[Glen Campbell]]. Their chemistry made the partnership a great success. The album peaked at number 11 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard 200|Top LP's]] chart and number one on the [[Top Country Albums|Top Country LP's]] chart. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA and earned Gentry and Campbell the [[Academy of Country Music]] award for Album of the Year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bobbie Gentry and Glen Campbell \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/bobbie-gentry-and-glen-campbell/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=February 10, 2020}}</ref> Gentry was also nominated for Top Female Vocalist.\n\n===1969: ''Touch 'Em with Love''===\nGentry produced a second series of shows for BCC 2 in 1969 which aired weekly from June 18 to July 23.\n\nGentry's fifth album, ''[[Touch 'Em with Love]]'', was released in July 1969. It marked a transition in her career, the album featured fewer self-penned regional song and more systematically chosen cover songs in an attempt to re-brand Gentry as a blue-eyed soul singer. Only two of the album's ten tracks were originals. The album was recorded in Nashville and produced by Kelso Herston. The album's title track was released as the first single and it failed to go any higher than number 113 on ''Billboard'''s [[Bubbling Under the Hot 100]] chart. The album fared no better, only reaching number 164 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Gentry's cover of \"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]\" was released as the second single in the UK where it became a number one hit on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The album reached number 21 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Touch \u2018Em with Love \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/touch-em-with-love/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Gentry taped four television specials for Canadian television station CFTO for North American syndication.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/43253837/|title=The Ottawa Journal from Ottawa,  \u00b7 Page 82|via=Newspapers.com|accessdate=October 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1970: ''Fancy''===\nApril 1970 saw the release of ''[[Fancy (Bobbie Gentry album)|Fancy]]'', Gentry's sixth album in three years. Like 1969's ''Touch 'Em with Love'', it is made up entirely of covers, except for the self-penned title track. The majority of the album was record at [[FAME Studios|Fame Recording Studios]] in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, with producer [[Rick Hall]]. \"[[Fancy (Bobbie Gentry song)|Fancy]]\" was released as the album's first single and was Gentry's biggest hit since \"Ode to Billie Joe\", peaking within the top 40 in the US, Canada and Australia. Born \"poor white trash,\" the beautiful Fancy is groomed to be a hooker by her impoverished sickly mother. In the end Fancy ends up with an \"elegant Georgia mansion\" and \"a New York townhouse flat\"\u2014no shame and no regrets. Of the song Gentry herself said, \"Fancy is my strongest statement for women's lib, if you really listen to it. I agree wholeheartedly with that movement and all the serious issues that [it stands] for\u2014equality, equal pay, day care centers, and abortion rights,\" she explained to After Dark magazine in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fancy \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/fancy/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe album's first European single, a cover of \"[[Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head]]\", peaked at number 40. The album's second North American single, \"He Made a Woman Out of Me\", did not reach the same heights as \"Fancy\", peaking at only number 71 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\nThe album would be nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Female]] at the [[13th Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\n===1971\u20131974: ''Patchwork'' and departure from Capitol===\nIn early 1971, Gentry produced a third and final series of shows for BBC 2. This third series again consisted of six episodes and aired weekly from February 1 to March 15.\n\nGentry released ''[[Patchwork (album)|Patchwork]]'' in April 1971. It has been described as a collection of short stories in song ranging from country to pop to blues, all stitched together with cinematic interludes to make a cohesive whole. ''Patchwork'' was Gentry's first album to be entirely self-written and produced. The album's first single was a small hit, peaking at number 37 on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Top 40 Easy Listening]] chart and number 93 in Canada. On the album's closing track, \"Lookin' In\", Gentry seems to be singing about herself.  \"I'm packing up and checking out,\" she sings. \"I just can't bring myself to compromise.\" It seems to be Gentry offering a commentary on her decision to leave her recording career behind for Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Patchwork \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/patchwork/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=February 10, 2020}}</ref> Gentry would release one more single for Capitol in August 1972, \"The Girl from Cincinnati\".\n\nAround the time ''Patchwork'' was released, the entire executive board that had been at Capitol throughout Gentry's career was fired. A major restructuring at Capitol took place as parent company EMI tried to seize back control and rekindle the label's dwindling profits. This saw the artist roster slashed from 247 to 81 alongside extensive cuts to production and marketing budgets. With none of the executive board left that had known and worked with her, negotiations stalled over the renewal terms of Gentry's contract, and this failure to reach an agreement with Capitol created a stalemate. Since Gentry was unwilling to release an album with Capitol on the terms offered, she found herself unable to release an album on another label, meaning she was left with no choice but to wait out the remaining option period of her contract.\n\nIn 1974, she hosted a summer replacement variety show on [[CBS]] called ''The Bobbie Gentry Happiness Hour''. The show, which was her version of Glen Campbell's hit series ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', was not renewed for a full season.\n\n===1975\u20131977: Post-Capitol recordings===\nIn 1975, Gentry wrote and performed \"Another Place, Another Time\" for writer-director [[Max Baer, Jr.]]'s film ''[[Macon County Line]]''. Following the film's success the song was released on a promotional [[7\" single]]. In 1976, Baer directed the feature film ''[[Ode to Billy Joe (film)|Ode to Billy Joe]]'', based on Gentry's hit song<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074995/ Ode to Billy Joe] International Movie Database</ref> and starring [[Robby Benson]] and [[Glynnis O'Connor]]. In the movie, the mystery of the title character's suicide is revealed as a part of the conflict between his love for Bobbie Lee Hartley and a drunken homosexual experience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ode-to-billy-joe-1976|title=Ode to Billy Joe movie review (1976) &#124; Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.com|accessdate=October 11, 2019}}</ref> [[Warner Bros. Records]] released a soundtrack of the score by Michel Legrand, including a re-recorded version of \"Ode to Billie Joe\", re-titled \"Ode to Billy Joe\" to match the film's title, with Gentry stating that the original spelling was an error. Warner Bros. released the new version as a single and Capitol released the original version, which gave Gentry two concurrent chart placings with the same song. The re-recording would go on to be Gentry's last single to chart, meaning that her first and last chart entries are the same song.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ode to Billy Joe (Soundtrack re-recording) \u2013 Bobbie Gentry |url=http://bobbiegentry.org.uk/discography/ode-to-billy-joe-soundtrack-re-recording/ |website=bobbiegentry.org.uk |accessdate=February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\nGentry recorded an album with producer Rick Hall for the [[Curb Records]] division of Warner Bros. Records in 1977. The first single, \"Steal Away\", was released in February 1978 and failed to chart. The full-length album was never released. Four additional tracks from these sessions have been released: \"He Did Me Wrong, But He Did It Right\" was released as the B-side of \"Steal Away\" in 1978, while \"Slow Cookin'\", \"Sweet Country\", and \"Thunder in the Afternoon\" were released on the European compilation album, ''Ode to Billie Joe'' in 1992.\n\n===1978\u20131982: Final performance and appearances===\nGentry appeared as a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' on Christmas Day 1978.\n\nShe attended the Best of Vegas Awards on March 21, 1980.\n\nOn May 10, 1981, Gentry was one of many celebrity guests to take part in ''An All-Star Salute to Mother's Day''. During the television special she performed \"Mama, a Rainbow\" from the musical ''Minnie's Boys'' for her mother who was seated in the audience. This would prove to be Gentry's final public performance.<ref name=\"imdb2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0313160/|title=Bobbie Gentry|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=October 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGentry's final public appearance came almost one year later when she attended the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] on April 30, 1982, she was 40 years old. \n\nSince that time, she has not recorded, performed or been interviewed.
