Henson's agent, Matt Ginvert, stated that Henson will return to Rugby after completing his commitments with the BBC's ''Strictly Come Dancing'' programme, and Saracens chief executive Edward Griffiths said that he saw no reason why Henson would not compete for the club before Christmas 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/my_club/saracens/9125923.stm|title=Gavin Henson joins Saracens after Ospreys release|date=27 October 2010|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=27 October 2010}}</ref> Henson signed for Saracens in October 2010, making his debut at [[Wembley Stadium]] in the Boxing Day 2010 match against [[Wasps RFC|London Wasps]]; his first competitive game since March 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.saracens.com/news/view.php?Id=6129 |title=Saracens sign Gavin Henson |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=28 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615102922/http://www.saracens.com/news/view.php?Id=6129 |archivedate=15 June 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/rugbynation/rugby-news/2010/12/27/gavin-henson-back-and-targeting-wales-return-91466-27890031/|author=Phil Blanche |title=Gavin Henson back and targeting Wales return |accessdate=27 December 2010 |date=27 December 2010 |publisher= [[Media Wales|Media Wales Ltd]] |location=Cardiff |work=[[WalesOnline]] website}}</ref> After playing four games for Saracens, starting only one, Henson was released from his contract on 2 February 2011.<ref name=BBC9385402>{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/my_club/saracens/9385402.stm | title = Saracens agree to Gavin Henson release | accessdate=2 February 2011|date=2 February 2011 | work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe same day, French sports newspaper ''[[L'Equipe]]'' reported that Henson had met [[RC Toulonnais]] head coach [[Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9]] and club owner [[Mourad Boudjellal]], for lunch in [[Toulon]].

The game has two main game modes, single player and local cooperative multiplayer mode. Single player mode can be extended with the daily run which has its own leader-board. The daily run can be played only once a day, it has a random character (even ones that the player has not unlocked yet) each day, and the generated world is predefined for all players to have a similar game-play experience. The player controls one of 12 characters, 9 of which must be unlocked through game-play. Each character has two different primary weapons they use, except the character \"The Bullet\", which has only one weapons. Each character also has a unique ability be it an ultimate ability that he/she has to charge or a passive ability that is always active. These abilities offer a different play-style for each of the characters.\n\nThe player progresses through 5 different environments that are procedurally generated. The environments follow a set path, the order is always Sand, Jungle, Medieval, Mines, Greek. At the end of every environment the player faces one of the games 6 bosses. The last environments boss, Ugh Zan, has two different forms, and it is fought as two different bosses. After killing the final boss the player enters a time portal that teleports them to the first environment but with increased difficulty. Loops can be run endlessly and get more difficult each time. Loops increase the number of enemies and all the games enemies can be spawned on all environments after the first loop. The increase in difficulty also raises the number of environmental traps that can kill the player.\n\nKilling the games bosses unlocks shrines in the games lobby that can activate curses. Curses add additional mechanics to the game that makes it more difficult. The curses range from additional environmental traps, like poison, to death lasers that follow the player around the game world. Each curse also adds a modifier to the final score. The curses add a way for the players to naturally increase the difficulty to the point that suits them.\n\nThe player character starts of with a basic pistol weapon that has infinite ammo and a melee weapon. During gameplay the player can pickup ammo for his primary weapons or destroy weapon crates to get special weapons. The 34 special weapons each have a unique twist to them, for example the biomedic sniper can heal the player, while the gravity gun can group up enemies and make short work of them. The player unlocks new special weapons by completing different tasks in the game.\n\nWhile playing the player defeats enemies and destroys the environment to gather Mojo, the games equivalent to experience. When enough mojo is gathered the player level ups and gains a perk which he can select from a group of three different perk per level. The perk he/she will get on the next level up is also indicated to make it possible to plan out builds one level in advance.\n\n== Plot ==\n''I Hate Running Backwards'' is set in the universe of ''[[Serious Sam]]'' at an undisclosed moment in time. One of Mental's subordinates, Ugh-Zan has been put together from the parts of Ugh-Zan and Hugo and sent to the future to stop the group of heroes from fighting Mental. Ugh-Zan's mind was uploaded to the new mechanized body and he can also transfer it to the tank module that is stored inside his body as a last defense mode.\n\nSam and his group of heroes travel through time to defeat Mental's minions once and for all.\n\n== Characters ==\n[[File:SSPoseWiki.png|left|thumb|Serious Sam]]\n''I Hate Running Backwards'' features characters from different franchises that were published by [[Devolver Digital]], with the exception of ''[[Nuclear Throne]]'', which was published and developed by [[Vlambeer]]. The characters that are featured in the game are Serious Sam, Dancing Denzell, and Fast Finger Freddie from the ''[[Serious Sam]]'' franchise, Richard from ''[[Hotline Miami]]'', Rambro from ''[[Broforce]]'', The Bullet from ''[[Enter the Gungeon]]'', Crystal from ''[[Nuclear Throne]]'', and Lo Wang from ''[[Shadow Warrior]]''. The other 4 characters in game are unique characters from ''I Hate Running Backwards''.\n\n== Development ==\nDevelopment on ''I Hate Running Backwards'' started in 2016.  The developers of the game, Binx Interactive are a small team consisting of five developers who worked on video games as a hobby, but were showing up to game developer conferences in Croatia. On one of the Conferences [[Croteam]]'s CEO Roman Ribaric and CMO Damjan Mravunac decided to give Binx a chance in their new incubator program. The idea of the program was to provide local developers with the support and equipment to make full-fledged video games.\n\nThe idea for the game came from Serious Sams catch phrase: \"I hate running backwards\" alluding to him constantly having to run backwards from enemies to avoid them killing him. The game was first structured as a simple action endless runner game with the focus on leading enemies into environmental traps that were spawned behind the player. The challenge in the game would come from the player having to avoid the same traps he would have to lead the enemies into. One of the games programmers, Denis Mraovi\u0107 came up with the idea to add the hammer swing mechanic into the game at one point, as he felt that the constant shooting tired him out, and he wanted to have something more to do during gameplay.\n\nThe game was first shown to the public at Reboot-Infogamer in 2016. where the game won the best game-play award.

The game has two main game modes, single player and local cooperative multiplayer mode. Single player mode can be extended with the daily run which has its own leader-board. The daily run can be played only once a day, it has a random character (even ones that the player has not unlocked yet) each day, and the generated world is predefined for all players to have a similar game-play experience. The player controls one of 12 characters, 9 of which must be unlocked through game-play. Each character has two different primary weapons they use, except the character \"The Bullet\", which has only one weapons. Each character also has a unique ability be it an ultimate ability that he/she has to charge or a passive ability that is always active. These abilities offer a different play-style for each of the characters.\n\nThe player progresses through 5 different environments that are procedurally generated. The environments follow a set path, the order is always Sand, Jungle, Medieval, Mines, Greek. At the end of every environment the player faces one of the games 6 bosses. The last environments boss, Ugh Zan, has two different forms, and it is fought as two different bosses. After killing the final boss the player enters a time portal that teleports them to the first environment but with increased difficulty. Loops can be run endlessly and get more difficult each time. Loops increase the number of enemies and all the games enemies can be spawned on all environments after the first loop. The increase in difficulty also raises the number of environmental traps that can kill the player.\n\nKilling the games bosses unlocks shrines in the games lobby that can activate curses. Curses add additional mechanics to the game that makes it more difficult. The curses range from additional environmental traps, like poison, to death lasers that follow the player around the game world. Each curse also adds a modifier to the final score. The curses add a way for the players to naturally increase the difficulty to the point that suits them.\n\nThe player character starts of with a basic pistol weapon that has infinite ammo and a melee weapon. During gameplay the player can pickup ammo for his primary weapons or destroy weapon crates to get special weapons. The 34 special weapons each have a unique twist to them, for example the biomedic sniper can heal the player, while the gravity gun can group up enemies and make short work of them. The player unlocks new special weapons by completing different tasks in the game.\n\nWhile playing the player defeats enemies and destroys the environment to gather Mojo, the games equivalent to experience. When enough mojo is gathered the player level ups and gains a perk which he can select from a group of three different perk per level. The perk he/she will get on the next level up is also indicated to make it possible to plan out builds one level in advance.\n\n== Plot ==\n''I Hate Running Backwards'' is set in the universe of ''[[Serious Sam]]'' at an undisclosed moment in time. One of Mental's subordinates, Ugh-Zan has been put together from the parts of Ugh-Zan and Hugo and sent to the future to stop the group of heroes from fighting Mental. Ugh-Zan's mind was uploaded to the new mechanized body and he can also transfer it to the tank module that is stored inside his body as a last defense mode.\n\nSam and his group of heroes travel through time to defeat Mental's minions once and for all.\n\n== Characters ==\n[[File:SSPoseWiki.png|left|thumb|Serious Sam]]\n''I Hate Running Backwards'' features characters from different franchises that were published by [[Devolver Digital]], with the exception of ''[[Nuclear Throne]]'', which was published and developed by [[Vlambeer]]. The characters that are featured in the game are Serious Sam, Dancing Denzell, and Fast Finger Freddie from the ''[[Serious Sam]]'' franchise, Richard from ''[[Hotline Miami]]'', Rambro from ''[[Broforce]]'', The Bullet from ''[[Enter the Gungeon]]'', Crystal from ''[[Nuclear Throne]]'', and Lo Wang from ''[[Shadow Warrior]]''. The other 4 characters in game are unique characters from ''I Hate Running Backwards''.\n\n== Development ==\nDevelopment on ''I Hate Running Backwards'' started in 2016.  The developers of the game, Binx Interactive are a small team consisting of five developers who worked on video games as a hobby, but were showing up to game developer conferences in Croatia. On one of the Conferences [[Croteam]]'s CEO Roman Ribaric and CMO Damjan Mravunac decided to give Binx a chance in their new incubator program. The idea of the program was to provide local developers with the support and equipment to make full-fledged video games.\n\nThe idea for the game came from Serious Sams catch phrase: \"I hate running backwards\" alluding to him constantly having to run backwards from enemies to avoid them killing him. The game was first structured as a simple action endless runner game with the focus on leading enemies into environmental traps that were spawned behind the player. The challenge in the game would come from the player having to avoid the same traps he would have to lead the enemies into. One of the games programmers, Denis Mraovi\u0107 came up with the idea to add the hammer swing mechanic into the game at one point, as he felt that the constant shooting tired him out, and he wanted to have something more to do during gameplay.\n\nThe game was first shown to the public at Reboot-Infogamer in 2016. where the game won the best game-play award. The games hammer mechanic led the developers to introducing a redesign in graphics and the world. The whole game world was made destructible with the goal to make the experience more hands on. During the development cycle the game took shape as a rogue-like endless runner that turned the shoot-em-up genre on its head.\n\nSomewhere during 2017. Croteam and BinxInteractive got  [[Devolver Digital]] on board as the games publisher.

The Desert Column, a force of approximately 1,400 soldiers, started from [[Korti]], Sudan on 30 December 1884; the Desert Column's mission, in a joint effort titled \"The Gordon Relief Expedition\", was to march across the [[Bayuda Desert]] to the aid of General [[Charles George Gordon]] at [[Khartoum]], Sudan, who was besieged there by Mahdist forces.\n\nThe place is generally known in British military records as Abu Klea, which arose as a contemporary British spelling of its Arabic name, '''Abu T\u0345ulei\u0127'' (\u0623\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 \u0637\u064f\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062d).\n\n==Background==\nThe British forces consisted of the 1,100 British of the Desert Column under Sir [[Herbert Stewart]], against a Sudanese force of approximately 12,000 fighters. While the main British force (the River Column), led by General Sir [[Garnet Wolseley]] travelled by river from Korti to Khartoum, Stewart's column was to cut across country by column directly for Khartoum, since time was running short according to what little information was available from the garrison. The force was composed of four regiments of camel-mounted troops (Guards, Heavy, Light and Mounted Infantry), detachments of the various infantry regiments in Egypt and of the River Column, and a detachment of the [[19th Royal Hussars|19th Hussars]], mounted on horses. Four light field pieces and a small [[Naval Brigade]] manning a [[Gardner gun|Gardner machine gun]] completed the force.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Doug|title=THE DESERT COLUMN, 1884-5|url=http://www.savageandsoldier.com/sudan/DesertColumn.html|website=Savage and Soldier|accessdate=4 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nThe Desert Column arrived on the salient overlooking the wadi of Abu Klea not long before sunset, and Stewart decided not to attack that night. The British built a defensive position (or ''[[zariba]]''), but were sniped at from the high ground around them by Mahdist rifle-units - mainly soldiers from southern Sudan - all night. They took several casualties. At first light Stewart ordered them to form a [[Infantry square|square]], which they achieved with perfect discipline, though still under fire from enemy snipers. The square moved slowly towards the wells along the side of the wadi, over very difficult, undulating, rocky ground. Suddenly the square was ambushed by a huge Mahdist force that had been concealing itself in the wadi. The British guns were on the leading face of the square, and the Naval Brigade, with their Gardner machine gun, at the rear left hand corner, nearest the wadi. Several officers and men of [[HMS Alexandra (1875)|HMS ''Alexandra'']] were killed at the battle. As the British halted to repel the Mahdist force, a gap opened up towards the rear left corner of the square. This was caused when Captain [[Lord Charles Beresford]] RN, commanding the Naval Brigade, ordered the [[Gardner gun]] to be run out on the left flank of the [[infantry square]] to provide covering fire. Colonel [[Frederick Gustavus Burnaby]] then gave an impromptu order for the Heavy Camel Regiment to wheel out of the square in support of the Gardner gun. The gun had been tested and found very reliable in Britain, but had not been tested in a desert with loose sand getting into its mechanism. It fired seventy rounds and then jammed, and as the crew tried to clear it they were cut down in a rush by the [[Dervish]]es. Out of the forty men in the Naval contingent, Lieutenants Alfred Piggott and Rudolph de Lisle were killed along with Chief Boatswain's Mate Bill Rhodes and five other seamen and seven more were wounded. Beresford was 'scratched' on the left hand by a spear as he managed to duck under the gun. The weight of the rush pushed the sailors back into the face of the square. Several Dervishes got inside the square, but found the interior full of camels and could not proceed. The troops in the rear ranks faced about and opened fire into the press of men and camels behind them, and were able to drive the Dervishes out of the square and compel them to retreat from the field.\n\n[[File:MACDONALD(1887) p263 SKETCH MAP OF BATTLE FIELD OF ABU-KLEA.jpg|thumbnail|300px|Map of the Battle Field of Abu-Klea]]\nThe battle was short, lasting barely fifteen minutes from start to finish. Casualties for the British were nine officers and 65 other ranks killed and over a hundred wounded. The Mahdists lost 1,100 dead during the fifteen minutes of fighting, made all the worse by only 5,000 of the Dervish force being engaged.<ref>Dictionary of battles from the earliest date to the present time by Thomas Benfield Harbottle published 1904</ref> Among the Dervish dead was Musa wad Helu, one of the Mahdist chiefs. British national hero Colonel [[F. G. Burnaby]] of the [[Royal Horse Guards]] was killed by a spear to the throat. [[Francis William Rhodes|Frank Rhodes]] (brother of [[Cecil Rhodes|Cecil]]) distinguished himself when several horses were shot under him during the engagement, earning him a [[Distinguished Service Order]]. Gunner [[Alfred Smith (VC)|Alfred Smith]] fought bravely to save his officer, Lieutenant Guthrie, and was awarded a [[Victoria Cross|VC]]. Another action happened two days later at ''Abu Kru'' (the [[Battle of El Gubat]]) and the advance rescue force leader Major General [[Sir Herbert Stewart]] was mortally wounded leaving command to the inexperienced leader Brigadier General [[Charles William Wilson|Sir Charles Wilson]] (the column's intelligence officer) who was slower in organizing his forces.\n\nA report in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper says that Burnaby \"fell while reforming a broken British square\" (this being one of only two recorded cases of a British square breaking in the 19th century),<ref>White-Spunner, p.400-408</ref> but a small gap which quickly closed is not the same as a square breaking.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[Image:Egyptian Campaign Memorial, Old Steine, Brighton (IoE Code 481000).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Egyptian Campaign Memorial]] in [[Brighton]], [[East Sussex]], England.]]\nThe column was too late to save [[Khartoum]]; the Mahdists captured it two days before the column arrived, leading to the death of [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]]. The British then withdrew from the Sudan, leaving the [[Dervish (disambiguation)|Dervishes]] of the Mahdi to rule Sudan for the next 13 years. The official public blame for this failure was left with [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] for delaying several months, to the considerable anger expressed in public of [[Queen Victoria]], to authorize a rescue. Gladstone lost public confidence and much authority and within two months he resigned.\n\nThe battle was celebrated by the [[doggerel]] poet [[William McGonagall]]:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nYe sons of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], come join with me,\nAnd sing in praise of Sir Herbert Stewart\u2019s little army,\nThat made ten thousand Arabs flee\nAt the charge of the bayonet at Abou Klea\n</poem></blockquote>\nand so on for 19 stanzas.<ref>{{cite web |first=William |last=McGonagall |title=The Battle of Abu Klea |website=McGonagall Online |date=1885 |url=http://www.mcgonagall-online.org.uk/gems/the-battle-of-abu-klea}}</ref>\n\nAnd also the battle and one of its notable participants is mentioned in the song \"Colonel Burnaby\", which has as its chorus:\n<blockquote>\nWeep not my boys, for those who fell,\nThey did not flinch nor fear.\nThey stood their ground like Englishmen,\nand died at Abu Klea\n</blockquote>\n\nThe rhymes in these poems show varying attempts at pronouncing \"Klea\" from the English spelling, and the rhyme with \"fear\" shows British English [[arhotic]] pronunciation.\n\nMore celebrated and of higher literary quality, but taking substantial liberties for the exact events, is the mention of the battle in verse two of [[Sir Henry Newbolt]]'s poem ''[[Vitai Lampada]]'':\n<blockquote><poem>\n\u2026The sand of the desert is sodden red,\nRed with the wreck of a square that broke;\nThe [[Gatling]]\u2019s jammed and the colonel dead,\nAnd the regiment blind with dust and smoke.\nThe river of death has brimmed his banks,\nAnd England\u2019s far, and Honour a name,\nBut the voice of the schoolboy rallies the ranks,\n\u201cPlay up! play up! and play the game!\u201d\n</poem></blockquote>\n[[File:176 (Abu Klea) Battery Royal Artillery emblem.png|thumb|right|The emblem of 176 (Abu Klea) Battery Royal Artillery]]\n\"The wreck of a square\" is a severe exaggeration, and Newbolt conflated Abu Klea with other events such as the [[Battle of Tamai]]; most of the dead were Mahdists. Newbolt's reference to the [[Gatling]] is wrong, as the British force at Abu Klea had the American [[Gardner gun|Gardner]] machine gun. The [[Royal Artillery]] unit which took part in the battle still exists today, re-numbered as [[176 (Abu Klea) Battery Royal Artillery|176 Battery]], and has the [[honour title]] \"Abu Klea\", awarded in 1955 in recognition of the Victoria Cross won by Gunner Smith.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Khartoum (film)|''Khartoum'' (film)]]\n* [[The Four Feathers (2002 film)|''The Four Feathers'']], a film from 2002, where the battle is portrayed very different from reality and as a disastrous defeat instead of a victory.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [[Michael Asher (explorer)|Asher, Michael]], \"Khartoum - The Ultimate Imperial Adventure\"  Penguin, 2004.

Colonel [[Frederick Gustavus Burnaby]] then gave an impromptu order for the Heavy Camel Regiment to wheel out of the square in support of the Gardner gun. The gun had been tested and found very reliable in Britain, but had not been tested in a desert with loose sand getting into its mechanism. It fired seventy rounds and then jammed, and as the crew tried to clear it they were cut down in a rush by the [[Dervish]]es. Out of the forty men in the Naval contingent, Lieutenants Alfred Piggott and Rudolph de Lisle were killed along with Chief Boatswain's Mate Bill Rhodes and five other seamen and seven more were wounded. Beresford was 'scratched' on the left hand by a spear as he managed to duck under the gun. The weight of the rush pushed the sailors back into the face of the square. Several Dervishes got inside the square, but found the interior full of camels and could not proceed. The troops in the rear ranks faced about and opened fire into the press of men and camels behind them, and were able to drive the Dervishes out of the square and compel them to retreat from the field.\n\n[[File:MACDONALD(1887) p263 SKETCH MAP OF BATTLE FIELD OF ABU-KLEA.jpg|thumbnail|300px|Map of the Battle Field of Abu-Klea]]\nThe battle was short, lasting barely fifteen minutes from start to finish. Casualties for the British were nine officers and 65 other ranks killed and over a hundred wounded. The Mahdists lost 1,100 dead during the fifteen minutes of fighting, made all the worse by only 5,000 of the Dervish force being engaged.<ref>Dictionary of battles from the earliest date to the present time by Thomas Benfield Harbottle published 1904</ref> Among the Dervish dead was Musa wad Helu, one of the Mahdist chiefs. British national hero Colonel [[F. G. Burnaby]] of the [[Royal Horse Guards]] was killed by a spear to the throat. [[Francis William Rhodes|Frank Rhodes]] (brother of [[Cecil Rhodes|Cecil]]) distinguished himself when several horses were shot under him during the engagement, earning him a [[Distinguished Service Order]]. Gunner [[Alfred Smith (VC)|Alfred Smith]] fought bravely to save his officer, Lieutenant Guthrie, and was awarded a [[Victoria Cross|VC]]. Another action happened two days later at ''Abu Kru'' (the [[Battle of El Gubat]]) and the advance rescue force leader Major General [[Sir Herbert Stewart]] was mortally wounded leaving command to the inexperienced leader Brigadier General [[Charles William Wilson|Sir Charles Wilson]] (the column's intelligence officer) who was slower in organizing his forces.\n\nA report in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper says that Burnaby \"fell while reforming a broken British square\" (this being one of only two recorded cases of a British square breaking in the 19th century),<ref>White-Spunner, p.400-408</ref> but a small gap which quickly closed is not the same as a square breaking.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[Image:Egyptian Campaign Memorial, Old Steine, Brighton (IoE Code 481000).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Egyptian Campaign Memorial]] in [[Brighton]], [[East Sussex]], England.]]\nThe column was too late to save [[Khartoum]]; the Mahdists captured it two days before the column arrived, leading to the death of [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]]. The British then withdrew from the Sudan, leaving the [[Dervish (disambiguation)|Dervishes]] of the Mahdi to rule Sudan for the next 13 years. The official public blame for this failure was left with [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] for delaying several months, to the considerable anger expressed in public of [[Queen Victoria]], to authorize a rescue. Gladstone lost public confidence and much authority and within two months he resigned.\n\nThe battle was celebrated by the [[doggerel]] poet [[William McGonagall]]:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nYe sons of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], come join with me,\nAnd sing in praise of Sir Herbert Stewart\u2019s little army,\nThat made ten thousand Arabs flee\nAt the charge of the bayonet at Abou Klea\n</poem></blockquote>\nand so on for 19 stanzas.<ref>{{cite web |first=William |last=McGonagall |title=The Battle of Abu Klea |website=McGonagall Online |date=1885 |url=http://www.mcgonagall-online.org.uk/gems/the-battle-of-abu-klea}}</ref>\n\nAnd also the battle and one of its notable participants is mentioned in the song \"Colonel Burnaby\", which has as its chorus:\n<blockquote>\nWeep not my boys, for those who fell,\nThey did not flinch nor fear.\nThey stood their ground like Englishmen,\nand died at Abu Klea\n</blockquote>\n\nThe rhymes in these poems show varying attempts at pronouncing \"Klea\" from the English spelling, and the rhyme with \"fear\" shows British English [[arhotic]] pronunciation.\n\nMore celebrated and of higher literary quality, but taking substantial liberties for the exact events, is the mention of the battle in verse two of [[Sir Henry Newbolt]]'s poem ''[[Vitai Lampada]]'':\n<blockquote><poem>\n\u2026The sand of the desert is sodden red,\nRed with the wreck of a square that broke;\nThe [[Gatling]]\u2019s jammed and the colonel dead,\nAnd the regiment blind with dust and smoke.\nThe river of death has brimmed his banks,\nAnd England\u2019s far, and Honour a name,\nBut the voice of the schoolboy rallies the ranks,\n\u201cPlay up! play up! and play the game!\u201d\n</poem></blockquote>\n[[File:176_(Abu_Klea)_Battery_Royal_Artillery_emblem.png|thumb|right|The emblem of 176 (Abu Klea) Battery Royal Artillery]]\n\"The wreck of a square\" is a severe exaggeration, and Newbolt conflated Abu Klea with other events such as the [[Battle of Tamai]]; most of the dead were Mahdists. Newbolt's reference to the [[Gatling]] is wrong, as the British force at Abu Klea had the American [[Gardner gun|Gardner]] machine gun. The [[Royal Artillery]] unit which took part in the battle still exists today, re-numbered as [[176 (Abu Klea) Battery Royal Artillery|176 Battery]], and has the [[honour title]] \"Abu Klea\", awarded in 1955 in recognition of the Victoria Cross won by Gunner Smith.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Khartoum (film)|''Khartoum'' (film)]]\n*[[The Four Feathers (2002 film)|''The Four Feathers'']], a film from 2002, where the battle is portrayed very different from reality and as a disastrous defeat instead of a victory.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[[Michael Asher (explorer)|Asher, Michael]], \"Khartoum - The Ultimate Imperial Adventure\"  Penguin, 2004.

It focuses on the materials and on the manual labour on the part of the artist as part of the works' significance, and prioritizes aesthetic value over utility.\n\n==History==\nThe term fiber art came into use by curators and art historians to describe the work of the artist-craftsman following [[World War II]].  Those years saw a sharp increase in the design and production of \"art fabric.\"   In the 1950s, as the contributions of craft artists became more recognized\u2014not just in fiber but in clay and other media\u2014an increasing number of [[Weaving|weavers]] began binding fibers into nonfunctional forms as works of art.<ref name=Lunin>{{cite journal|last=Lunin|first=Lois F.|title=The Descriptive Challenges of Fiber Art|journal=Library Trends|year=1990|volume=38|issue=4|pages=697\u2013716|publisher=Board of Trustees, University of Illinois}}</ref>\n\nThe 1960s and 70s brought an international revolution in fiber art.<ref name=Baizerman>{{cite journal|last=Baizerman|first=Suzanne|title=California and the Fiber Art Revolution|journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings|year=2004|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/tsaconf/449/|accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref> Beyond weaving, fiber structures were created through knotting, twining, plaiting, coiling, pleating, lashing, and interlacing.  Artists in the United States and Europe explored the qualities of fabric to develop works that could be hung or free standing, \"two or three dimensional, flat or volumetric, many stories high or miniature, nonobjective or figurative, and representational or fantasy.\"<ref name=Lunin /> In the UK the founding of [[62 Group of Textile Artists|The 62 Group of Textile Artists]] coincided with a growth in interest in using textile media in a fine art context. The [[second-wave feminism|women's movement]] of the same era was important in contributing to the rise of fiber art because of the traditional association of women with textiles in the domestic sphere; indeed, many of the most prominent fiber artists are women.<ref name=Baizerman /><ref>{{cite book | last = Langreiter| first = Nikola | contribution = Neues Handarbeiten \u2013 Radical?

For fiber artists, in addition to long-standing experimentation with materials and techniques, this brought \"a new focus on creating work which confronted cultural issues such as: [[Who Stole Feminism?|gender feminism]]; [[domesticity]] and the repetitive tasks related to women's work; politics; the social and behavioral sciences; material specific concepts related to fiber's softness, permeability, drapability, and so on.\"<ref name=Marcus>{{cite journal|last=Marcus|first=Sharon|title=Critical Issues in Tapestry|journal=A Quarterly Review of Tapestry Art Today|year=2004|volume=30|issue=2|pages=2\u20133|url=http://americantapestryalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Critical-Issues-in-Tapestry-SMarcus.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Fiber within the context of the textile arts==\nModern fiber art takes its context from the [[textile arts]], which have been practiced globally for millennia. Traditionally, fiber is taken from [[plant fiber|plants]] or [[animal fiber|animals]], for example [[cotton]] from cotton seed pods, [[linen]] from [[flax]] stems, [[wool]] from [[sheep]] hair, or [[silk]] from the spun cocoons of silkworms. In addition to these traditional materials, [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] materials such as plastic [[Acrylic fiber|acrylic]] are now used.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nPrior to the development of weaving and related approaches using twisted strands, fabrics were made from single sheets of material, such as animal skins.  [[Felt]]ing was an invention that allowed for the creation of a textile from fleece that had been sorted, combed, laid out in thin sheets that were then rolled or agitated with other friction until the tiny barbules on the fiber twisted and connected.  This process created a smooth connected textile that could be cut, sewn or used in other ways.  Evidence of felting was found in burial vaults in Siberia of the 7th or 8th century B.C.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fashioning Felt|last=Brown|first=Susan|publisher=Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum Smithsonian Instituttion|date=March 2009|isbn=978-0-910503-89-1}}</ref>\n\nWeaving, however, has been the dominant way to produce clothes. In some cultures, weaving forms demonstrate social status. The more intricate the weaving, the higher the status.  Certain symbols and colors also allowed identification of class and position. For example, in the ancient [[Inca civilization|Incan civilization]], black and white designs indicated a military status.<ref name=\"getlein\" />\n\nIn order for the fiber that will be used in weaving (whether plant or animal) to be made into cloth or clothing, it must be [[spinning (textiles)|spun]] (or twisted) into a strand known as [[yarn]]. When the yarn is ready and [[dye]]d for use it can be made into cloth in a number of ways. [[Knitting]] and [[crochet]] are common methods of twisting and shaping the yarn into garments or fabric.  The most common use of yarn to make cloth is [[weaving]].  In weaving, the yarn is wrapped on a frame called a [[loom]] and pulled taut vertically. This is known as the [[warp (weaving)|warp]]. Then another strand of yarn is worked back and forth wrapping over and under the warp.  This wrapped yarn is called the [[weft]]. Most art and commercial textiles are made by this process.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn Europe between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries woven pieces called \"[[tapestry|tapestries]]\" took the place of paintings on walls. ''The Unicorn in Captivity'' is part of a series consisting of seven tapestry panels known as ''[[The Hunt of the Unicorn]]'' by Franco Flemish from this time period.  Much of the art at the time in history was used to tell common folktales that also had a religious theme. As Mark Getlein wrote, \"Tapestry is a special type of weaving in which the weft yarns are manipulated freely to form a pattern or design on the front of the fabric...Often the weft yarns are of several colors and the weaver can use the different-colored yarns almost as flexible as a painter uses pigment on canvas.\"<ref name=getlein>{{cite book|last=Getlein|first=Mark|title=Living with art|year=2008|publisher=McGraw Hill|pages=288\u2013289|oclc=77076176}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time period in the Middle East, fiber artists did not make tapestry or wall hanging weavings, but instead created beautifully crafted rugs. The woven rugs did not depict scenes in a story, but instead used symbols and complex designs. An example of this type of art are the giant rugs known as the [[Ardabil Carpet]]s. Getlein wrote, \"Like most Islamic carpets, they were created by knotting individual tufts of wool onto a woven ground.\"<ref name=getlein />\n\nAnother fiber art technique is [[quilting]] in which layers of fabric are sewn together.  Although this technique has not been around for as long as weaving, it is a popular form of art in American history.  Recently, quilted fiber art wall hangings have become popular with art collectors.  This non-traditional form often features bold designs.

Fiber art works are works of art that communicate some sort of message, emotion or meaning and go beyond just the literal meaning of the materials.

Women started to sew less because it became more affordable to purchase well-made clothing from stores. Fabric retailers found that they needed to convince women to return to their sewing machines, so the companies devised a variety of strategies to revitalize sewing. A theme that many retailers employed was to send out the message that sewing not only saved money and let them explore their personal style, but was also a way to be feminine and show gracefulness. Sewing was portrayed as a way to be a good mother and an attractive and thrifty wife.<ref>Gordon, Sarah A. \"Make It Yourself: Home Sewing, Gender, and Culture, 1890\u20131930\".

The critical response from women and feminist's reviews and articles were similar. These two shows were based on Parker's book.<ref name=\"Barnett\"/>\n\nBarnett describes that most historical studies of embroidery concentrate on questions of style and technique, where these exhibitions track the idea of femininity that was forced upon women through embroidery from medieval times, when it was considered a high art form practiced by both men and women, to its current denotation as a 'feminine craft'.  But perhaps this exhibition, with both historical and modern shows side by side provoke new ideas into the more historical objects. Adding names and dates to the creation of the objects thrusts them into the art world once again. The context in which these women worked, varying greatly because of class, race, and gender, juxtaposed with contemporary work beside names, dates, and even poetry created a language and a new critical way of looking into this medium.<ref name=\"Barnett\"/>\n\nAs [[Ann Newdigate]] states in her essay \"Kinda art, sorta tapestry: tapestry as shorthand access to the definitions, languages, institutions, attitudes, hierarchies, ideologies, constructions, classifications, histories, prejudices and other bad habits of the West\", there was a shift in textiles after ''The Subversive Stitch'' was published.\n{{quote|text=\"Then in 1984 when Rozsika Parker's ''The Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine'', focusing on textiles, could not be resisted by even the most conservative of Western practitioners; modernism was finally disrupted in the Low Art sphere.

It's largely linked to [[third-wave feminism]] and also other Feminist movements such as the music movement [[Riot Grrrl]]. The term craftivism was coined by Betsy Greer in 2003, and runs Craftivist Collective, however it is technically not a new term.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://craftivist-collective.com/our-story/ |title=Our Story |website=craftivist-collective.com |accessdate=20 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Germaine Greer]], who advocates for the connection of women, nature, and craft, argued that women's craft should be in the home because it is a living art, not in a gallery or museum because galleries and museums are representative of dead male culture.  Greer supports the use of textiles in different settings, of which craftivism almost always employs.<ref name=\"Barnett\"/>\n\nMost recently, craftism and the fiber arts have served as an important channel for the expressive of social protest, an example of which is the women's marches after the election of Donald Trump in 2018 and the pussyhat phenomenon.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crafting Dissent: Handicraft as Protest from the American Revolution to the Pussyhats|editor-last=Mandell|editor-first=Hinda|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|year=2019|isbn=978-1-5381-1839-9|location=Maryland}}</ref>\n\n===Fiber arts today===\nIn texts such as ''Hoopla: The Art of Unexpected Embroidery'', written by Leanne Prain, she interviews fiber artists from all around the world working with different styles and materials about their contemporary practices within contemporary art and commercial design. The book is a documentation of interviews with many different fiber artists from around the world. All of the interviews are tailored to each different artist, however one question that Leanne Prain keeps asking is \"Do you believe that your gender or social class has any bearing on your attraction to and involvement with needlework?\". Many artists in the book do identify as feminists.<ref>Prain, Leanne. Hoopla: The art of Unexpected Embroidery. Arsenal Pulp Press. Vancouver, 1976. Print.</ref>\n\nHowever, not all fiber artists are feminists, even with its histories. In a review written by Karen Rosenberg about \"Pricked: Extreme Embroidery\" at the Museum of Arts and Design (January\u2013April 2008), she states that it sounded like curators wanted to avoid the word 'craft' and describe these works by addressing process and materiality, of which sound \"less dated\". Rosenberg states that the most powerful argument against needlework as craft is the employment of threads as paint and painting or at least addressing painterly gesture. Rosenberg states that all of the artists exhibiting are attempting to blur the distinction between the decorative arts and the fine arts. However, Karen Rosenberg also critiques that the works were situated too close to each other, referring to the display as looking like a booth at a craft fair, so the success of leaving those associations behind has not been accomplished yet.<ref>Rosenberg, Karen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/arts/design/28embr.html?_r=0 \"Needling More Than the Feminist Consciousness\"], ''The New York Times'', 28 December 2007</ref>\n\nIn the Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine, Kate Walker is quoted saying that she has {{quote|text=\u201dnever worried that embroidery's association with femininity, sweetness, passivity and obedience may subvert my work's feminist intention.

What's required are physical and mental skills, fine aesthetic judgment in colour, texture and composition; patience during long training; and assertive individuality of design (and consequent disobedience of aesthetic convention).

For fiber artists, in addition to long-standing experimentation with materials and techniques, this brought \"a new focus on creating work which confronted cultural issues such as: [[Who Stole Feminism?|gender feminism]]; [[domesticity]] and the repetitive tasks related to women's work; politics; the social and behavioral sciences; material specific concepts related to fiber's softness, permeability, drapability, and so on.\"<ref name=Marcus>{{cite journal|last=Marcus|first=Sharon|title=Critical Issues in Tapestry|journal=A Quarterly Review of Tapestry Art Today|year=2004|volume=30|issue=2|pages=2\u20133|url=http://americantapestryalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Critical-Issues-in-Tapestry-SMarcus.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Fiber within the context of the textile arts==\nModern fiber art takes its context from the [[textile arts]], which have been practiced globally for millennia. Traditionally, fiber is taken from [[plant fiber|plants]] or [[animal fiber|animals]], for example [[cotton]] from cotton seed pods, [[linen]] from [[flax]] stems, [[wool]] from [[sheep]] hair, or [[silk]] from the spun cocoons of silkworms. In addition to these traditional materials, [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] materials such as plastic [[Acrylic fiber|acrylic]] are now used.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nPrior to the development of weaving and related approaches using twisted strands, fabrics were made from single sheets of material, such as animal skins.  [[Felt]]ing was an invention that allowed for the creation of a textile from fleece that had been sorted, combed, laid out in thin sheets that were then rolled or agitated with other friction until the tiny barbules on the fiber twisted and connected.  This process created a smooth connected textile that could be cut, sewn or used in other ways.  Evidence of felting was found in burial vaults in Siberia of the 7th or 8th century B.C.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fashioning Felt|last=Brown|first=Susan|publisher=Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum Smithsonian Instituttion|date=March 2009|isbn=978-0-910503-89-1}}</ref>\n\nWeaving, however, has been the dominant way to produce clothes. In some cultures, weaving forms demonstrate social status. The more intricate the weaving, the higher the status.  Certain symbols and colors also allowed identification of class and position. For example, in the ancient [[Inca civilization|Incan civilization]], black and white designs indicated a military status.<ref name=\"getlein\" />\n\nIn order for the fiber that will be used in weaving (whether plant or animal) to be made into cloth or clothing, it must be [[spinning (textiles)|spun]] (or twisted) into a strand known as [[yarn]]. When the yarn is ready and [[dye]]d for use it can be made into cloth in a number of ways. [[Knitting]] and [[crochet]] are common methods of twisting and shaping the yarn into garments or fabric.  The most common use of yarn to make cloth is [[weaving]].  In weaving, the yarn is wrapped on a frame called a [[loom]] and pulled taut vertically. This is known as the [[warp (weaving)|warp]]. Then another strand of yarn is worked back and forth wrapping over and under the warp.  This wrapped yarn is called the [[weft]]. Most art and commercial textiles are made by this process.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn Europe between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries woven pieces called \"[[tapestry|tapestries]]\" took the place of paintings on walls. ''The Unicorn in Captivity'' is part of a series consisting of seven tapestry panels known as ''[[The Hunt of the Unicorn]]'' by Franco Flemish from this time period.  Much of the art at the time in history was used to tell common folktales that also had a religious theme. As Mark Getlein wrote, \"Tapestry is a special type of weaving in which the weft yarns are manipulated freely to form a pattern or design on the front of the fabric...Often the weft yarns are of several colors and the weaver can use the different-colored yarns almost as flexible as a painter uses pigment on canvas.\"<ref name=getlein>{{cite book|last=Getlein|first=Mark|title=Living with art|year=2008|publisher=McGraw Hill|pages=288\u2013289|oclc=77076176}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time period in the Middle East, fiber artists did not make tapestry or wall hanging weavings, but instead created beautifully crafted rugs. The woven rugs did not depict scenes in a story, but instead used symbols and complex designs. An example of this type of art are the giant rugs known as the [[Ardabil Carpet]]s. Getlein wrote, \"Like most Islamic carpets, they were created by knotting individual tufts of wool onto a woven ground.\"<ref name=getlein />\n\nAnother fiber art technique is [[quilting]] in which layers of fabric are sewn together.  Although this technique has not been around for as long as weaving, it is a popular form of art in American history.  Recently, quilted fiber art wall hangings have become popular with art collectors.  This non-traditional form often features bold designs. [[quilt art|Quilting as an art form]] was popularized in the 1970s and 80s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Robert|title=The Art Quilt|date=1997|publisher=Hugh Lauter Levin Associates|location=New York|isbn=0-88363-007-9|url=http://www.saqa.com/news/history_Shaw.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509132332/http://www.saqa.com/news/history_Shaw.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-05-09}}</ref>\n\nOther fiber art techniques are knitting, [[rug hooking]], [[felting]], [[braid]]ing or plaiting, [[macrame]], [[lace]] making, [[flocking (texture)]] and more.  There are a wide variety of dye techniques.

Typically, pieces like [[pot-holder]]s, which just follow patterns without doing anything more, are not considered works of fiber art. Fiber art works are works of art that communicate some sort of message, emotion or meaning and go beyond just the literal meaning of the materials.

Women started to sew less because it became more affordable to purchase well-made clothing from stores. Fabric retailers found that they needed to convince women to return to their sewing machines, so the companies devised a variety of strategies to revitalize sewing. A theme that many retailers employed was to send out the message that sewing not only saved money and let them explore their personal style, but was also a way to be feminine and show gracefulness. Sewing was portrayed as a way to be a good mother and an attractive and thrifty wife.<ref>Gordon, Sarah A. \"Make It Yourself: Home Sewing, Gender, and Culture, 1890\u20131930\". Columbia University Press, New York. 2009. Print. Pg. 80</ref>\n\nDr. Deborah Thom, professor at Cambridge University, helps detail out a time where fiber art took a feminist turn during the [[Women's suffrage|Suffrage Movement]]\nwhere women were making embroidered banners for their protests.<ref>Dr. Deborah Thom [https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/b016vxz1 \"Woman's Hour\"], \"BBC Radio News\", Sat 5 November 2011</ref>\n\n===The reclamation of fiber arts===\nIn the 1970s, needlework was reclaimed by the [[Feminist Movement]]. This began the reintroduction of textiles and fiber in 'high art'.\n\n[[Judy Chicago]] founded the first feminist art program in the United States, and proceeded to coin the name [[Feminist Art]], with many artists working with fiber arts, especially in her project [[Womanhouse]].<ref>Viki D. Thompson Wylder and Lucy R. Lippard. Judy Chicago. Watson-Guptill Publications. June 2002. Print. Page 9.</ref>\nChicago created one of the first pieces of \"high art\" that incorporates and celebrates needlework and fabrics within women's history, called [[The Dinner Party]](1979).\n\n===''The Subversive Stitch''===\nIn 1984, [[Rozsika Parker]] published ''The Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the making of the feminine''. Parker has published books on art history and psychotherapy, and uses theories from both fields in her analysis of \"women's work\".<ref>Mida, Ingrid, [http://fashionismymuse.blogspot.ca/2010/07/book-review-subversive-stitch.html \"Book Review: The Subversive Stitch, Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine\"], ''Fashion is my Muse'', 29 July 2010</ref> Parker examines the belief of women and embroidery as both feminine and natural, and the appearance of natural that is actually socially constructed.<ref name=\"Barnett\">{{cite book|last1=Barnett|first1=Pennina|title=New Feminist Art Criticism: Critical Strategies|date=1995|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0-7190-4258-5|pages=76\u201384|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bM4fvz0mGtsC&pg=PA76|chapter=Afterthoughts on curating 'The Subversive Stitch'}}</ref>\n\nMany people had varying reactions from emotionally moved to deeply disgraced after seeing the exhibitions 'The Subversive Stitch', of which incorporated two shows called 'Embroidery in Women's Lives 1300\u20131900' and 'Women in Textiles Today' in July 1989, as recorded in Pennina Barnett's article \"Afterthoughts on curating 'The Subversive Stitch' \". The critical response from women and feminist's reviews and articles were similar. These two shows were based on Parker's book.<ref name=\"Barnett\"/>\n\nBarnett describes that most historical studies of embroidery concentrate on questions of style and technique, where these exhibitions track the idea of femininity that was forced upon women through embroidery from medieval times, when it was considered a high art form practiced by both men and women, to its current denotation as a 'feminine craft'.  But perhaps this exhibition, with both historical and modern shows side by side provoke new ideas into the more historical objects. Adding names and dates to the creation of the objects thrusts them into the art world once again. The context in which these women worked, varying greatly because of class, race, and gender, juxtaposed with contemporary work beside names, dates, and even poetry created a language and a new critical way of looking into this medium.<ref name=\"Barnett\"/>\n\nAs [[Ann Newdigate]] states in her essay \"Kinda art, sorta tapestry: tapestry as shorthand access to the definitions, languages, institutions, attitudes, hierarchies, ideologies, constructions, classifications, histories, prejudices and other bad habits of the West\", there was a shift in textiles after ''The Subversive Stitch'' was published.\n{{quote|text=\"Then in 1984 when Rozsika Parker's ''The Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine'', focusing on textiles, could not be resisted by even the most conservative of Western practitioners; modernism was finally disrupted in the Low Art sphere. The empowering implications spread beyond European textile artists and affected curators, teachers, and art administrators in a much wider Western context. The post-modern influence, even though in only a few instances, started to blend the firmly drawn lines of hierarchical distinctions. Twenty years after I had taken up art as my vocation, I began to feel the oppositional codes of the [[separate spheres]] slowly eroding as I wrote my thesis and investigated the domestication of tapestry from its previous high art status (until about the turn of the century) as a European male practice.|sign=Ann Newdigate|source=''Kinda art, sorta tapestry: tapestry as shorthand access to the definitions, languages, institutions, attitudes, hierarchies, ideologies, constructions, classifications, histories, prejudices and other bad habits of the West'', New Feminist Art Criticism: Critical Strategies. Page 178.}}\n\n===Craftivism within fiber arts===\n[[Craftivism]] is the continuation of craft for political purposes by women. It's largely linked to [[third-wave feminism]] and also other Feminist movements such as the music movement [[Riot Grrrl]]. The term craftivism was coined by Betsy Greer in 2003, and runs Craftivist Collective, however it is technically not a new term.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://craftivist-collective.com/our-story/ |title=Our Story |website=craftivist-collective.com |accessdate=20 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Germaine Greer]], who advocates for the connection of women, nature, and craft, argued that women's craft should be in the home because it is a living art, not in a gallery or museum because galleries and museums are representative of dead male culture.  Greer supports the use of textiles in different settings, of which craftivism almost always employs.<ref name=\"Barnett\"/>\n\nMost recently, craftism and the fiber arts have served as an important channel for the expressive of social protest, an example of which is the women's marches after the election of Donald Trump in 2018 and the pussyhat phenomenon.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crafting Dissent: Handicraft as Protest from the American Revolution to the Pussyhats|editor-last=Mandell|editor-first=Hinda|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|year=2019|isbn=978-1-5381-1839-9|location=Maryland}}</ref>\n\n===Fiber arts today===\nIn texts such as ''Hoopla: The Art of Unexpected Embroidery'', written by Leanne Prain, she interviews fiber artists from all around the world working with different styles and materials about their contemporary practices within contemporary art and commercial design. The book is a documentation of interviews with many different fiber artists from around the world. All of the interviews are tailored to each different artist, however one question that Leanne Prain keeps asking is \"Do you believe that your gender or social class has any bearing on your attraction to and involvement with needlework?\". Many artists in the book do identify as feminists.<ref>Prain, Leanne. Hoopla: The art of Unexpected Embroidery. Arsenal Pulp Press. Vancouver, 1976. Print.</ref>\n\nHowever, not all fiber artists are feminists, even with its histories. In a review written by Karen Rosenberg about \"Pricked: Extreme Embroidery\" at the Museum of Arts and Design (January\u2013April 2008), she states that it sounded like curators wanted to avoid the word 'craft' and describe these works by addressing process and materiality, of which sound \"less dated\". Rosenberg states that the most powerful argument against needlework as craft is the employment of threads as paint and painting or at least addressing painterly gesture. Rosenberg states that all of the artists exhibiting are attempting to blur the distinction between the decorative arts and the fine arts. However, Karen Rosenberg also critiques that the works were situated too close to each other, referring to the display as looking like a booth at a craft fair, so the success of leaving those associations behind has not been accomplished yet.<ref>Rosenberg, Karen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/arts/design/28embr.html?_r=0 \"Needling More Than the Feminist Consciousness\"], ''The New York Times'', 28 December 2007</ref>\n\nIn the Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine, Kate Walker is quoted saying that she has {{quote|text=\u201dnever worried that embroidery's association with femininity, sweetness, passivity and obedience may subvert my work's feminist intention. Femininity and sweetness are part of women's strength. Passitivity and obedience, moreover, are the very opposite of the qualities necessary to make a sustained effort in needlework. What's required are physical and mental skills, fine aesthetic judgment in colour, texture and composition; patience during long training; and assertive individuality of design (and consequent disobedience of aesthetic convention). Quiet strength need not be mistaken for useless vulnerability.\"|sign=[[Kate Walker (artist)|Kate Walker]]|source=''[[Rozsika Parker]], The Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine''. 1984. Print}}\n\nThe overall tone of the textile and fiber arts today sounds usually similar to feminist theory and strategy when Ann Newdigate states:\n{{quote|text=\"For me, now, it does not matter whether what I do in my studio complies with a minor or a major language \u2013 whether it is kinda art or sorta textile.

It maintains a core group of about 25 teachers.\n# the [https://www.tsgny.org/ Textile Study Group of New York] broadly supports appreciation of fiber arts and fiber artists.
