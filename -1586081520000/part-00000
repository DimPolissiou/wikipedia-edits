Founded in 1990, it is the oldest private university in the country.\n\n== History ==\nAnglo-American University was founded in 1990 as the Anglo-American College by Jansen Raichl and Vlasta Raichlov\u00e1, shortly after the [[Velvet Revolution|collapse of communism]]. Their aim was to create a higher education institution that would combine Central European university traditions with US and British academic principles. The college's name in English was later changed to ''university'' instead of college.\n\nIn 2010, AAU was the first university outside the United States to be invited to apply for institutional accreditation by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] (WASC). This accreditation was approved in 2016, with AAU becoming the first WASC-accredited university in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wscuc.org/resources/international|date=September 2016|title=International Institutions WASC Senior College and University Commission|website=www.wscuc.org}}</ref>\n\nCourses at AAU were initially organised under the School of [[Business administration|Business Administration]], School of [[Humanities]] and [[Social science|Social Sciences]], and School of [[Law]]. The university subsequently added a School of International Relations and Diplomacy (2006) and School of Journalism (2010). In late 2008, John H. Carey II, co-founder and lecturer at the school of law, died, and the AAU School of Law was renamed in his honour as the John H. Carey II School of Law.\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:Anglo-American University street.jpg|thumb|Main Campus at Letensk\u00e1 5, Prague|262x262px]]\n\n===Preparatory programs===\n\n* Certificate of Higher Education in Common Law (CertHE Common Law)\n\n===Bachelor programs===\n\n* Business Administration\n* Business Administration: Marketing and Communications Emphasis\n* Business Administration: Strategic Marketing Analysis and Planning Emphasis\n* Humanities, Society and Culture\n* International Relations\n* Jewish Studies: History and Culture\n* Journalism and Communications\n* Politics and Society\n* Visual Art Studies\n* Bachelor of Laws (LLB) \u2013 University of London International Programmes Courses\n\n===Master's programs===\n\n* Business and Law in International Markets\n* Humanities\n* International Relations and Diplomacy\n* Master of Law (LLM)\u2013 University of London International Programmes Courses\n\n===Professional Programs===\n\n* [[Master of Business Administration|MBA (Master of Business Administration)]] \u2013 in cooperation with Chapman University, California\n\nAAU also offers various courses related to Czech culture, including:\n\n* Czech and Slovak Politics\n* Cities of Central Europe: Prague, Vienna and Budapest\n* Literature of Prague\n* Prague Art and Architecture\n* [[Czech language|Czech]] as a foreign language\n\n== Accreditation ==\nMost of AAU's  programs are accredited by the [[Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (Czech Republic)|Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports]], except the Certificate of Higher Education in Common Law (CertHE Common Law), LLB, LLM, and the [[Chapman University|Chapman]] MBA program, which are offered in cooperation with international partners.\n\nAnglo-American University is accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges|WASC]] Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), an American accrediting agency which evaluates public and private senior colleges and universities in the western part of the United States. The accreditation was granted in June 2016 for a period of six years.

Founded in 1990, it is the oldest private university in the country.\n\n== History ==\nAnglo-American University was founded in 1990 as the Anglo-American College by Jansen Raichl and Vlasta Raichlov\u00e1, shortly after the [[Velvet Revolution|collapse of communism]]. Their aim was to create a higher education institution that would combine Central European university traditions with US and British academic principles. The college's name in English was later changed to ''university'' instead of college.\n\nIn 2010, AAU was the first university outside the United States to be invited to apply for institutional accreditation by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] (WASC). This accreditation was approved in 2016, with AAU becoming the first WASC-accredited university in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wscuc.org/resources/international|date=September 2016|title=International Institutions WASC Senior College and University Commission|website=www.wscuc.org}}</ref>\n\nCourses at AAU were initially organised under the School of [[Business administration|Business Administration]], School of [[Humanities]] and [[Social science|Social Sciences]], and School of [[Law]]. The university subsequently added a School of International Relations and Diplomacy (2006) and School of Journalism (2010). In late 2008, John H. Carey II, co-founder and lecturer at the school of law, died, and the AAU School of Law was renamed in his honour as the John H. Carey II School of Law.\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:Anglo-American University street.jpg|thumb|Main Campus at Letensk\u00e1 5, Prague|262x262px]]\n\n===Preparatory programs===\n\n* Certificate of Higher Education in Common Law (CertHE Common Law)\n\n===Bachelor programs===\n\n* Business Administration\n* Business Administration: Marketing and Communications Emphasis\n* Business Administration: Strategic Marketing Analysis and Planning Emphasis\n* Humanities, Society and Culture\n* International Relations\n* Jewish Studies: History and Culture\n* Journalism and Communications\n* Politics and Society\n* Visual Art Studies\n* Bachelor of Laws (LLB) \u2013 University of London International Programmes Courses\n\n===Master's programs===\n\n* Business and Law in International Markets\n* Humanities\n* International Relations and Diplomacy\n* Master of Law (LLM)\u2013 University of London International Programmes Courses\n\n===Professional Programs===\n\n* [[Master of Business Administration|MBA (Master of Business Administration)]] \u2013 in cooperation with Chapman University, California\n\nAAU also offers various courses related to Czech culture, including:\n\n* Czech and Slovak Politics\n* Cities of Central Europe: Prague, Vienna and Budapest\n* Literature of Prague\n* Prague Art and Architecture\n* [[Czech language|Czech]] as a foreign language\n\n== Accreditation ==\nMost of AAU's  programs are accredited by the [[Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (Czech Republic)|Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports]], except the Certificate of Higher Education in Common Law (CertHE Common Law), LLB, LLM, and the [[Chapman University|Chapman]] MBA program, which are offered in cooperation with international partners.\n\nAnglo-American University is accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges|WASC]] Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), an American accrediting agency which evaluates public and private senior colleges and universities in the western part of the United States. The accreditation was granted in June 2016 for a period of six years. The accreditation was granted on the basis of the university having a sufficient level of compliance with WSCUC's 2013 Standards of Accreditation, and satisfactorily addressing the core commitments to Student Learning and Success, Quality and Improvement, and Institutional Integrity, Sustainability, and Accountability.\n\nThe MBA program offered in cooperation with Chapman University, California is globally accredited by the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] AACSB. The Certificate of Higher Education in Common Law (CertHE Common Law) and the LLB and LLM programs are offered in cooperation with the [[University of London]].\n\nAAU is a member of the Association of American International Colleges and Universities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Anglo-American University |url=http://www.aaicu.org/anglo-american-university/ |website=AAICU |accessdate=17 September 2019 |date=19 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n== University facilities ==\n=== Campus ===\n[[File:Anglo-American University Campus at Letenska 5.jpg|thumb|Anglo-American University Campus at Letensk\u00e1 5]]AAU\u2019s main campus is located in the newly restored Thurn-Taxis Palace, a cultural monument dating to the 17th century, previously owned by the German [[Thurn und Taxis|Thurn und Taxis noble family]] and now under the ownership of the [[Prague|city of Prague]].
