petalling, or hot gas washing\").<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|258}} This included the pieces on which trace amounts of explosives were found.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|258}} Of the 5 percent of the fuselage that was not recovered, none of the missing areas were large enough to have covered all the damage that would have been caused by the detonation of a bomb or missile.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|258}} None of the victims' remains showed any evidence of injuries that could have been caused by high-energy explosives.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|258}}\n\nThe NTSB considered the possibility that the explosive residue was due to contamination from the aircraft's use in 1991 transporting troops during the [[Gulf War]] or its use in a dog-training explosive detection exercise about one month before the accident.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|258\u2013259}} Testing conducted by the FAA's Technical Center indicated that residues of the type of explosives found on the wreckage would dissipate completely after two days of immersion in sea water (almost all recovered wreckage was immersed longer than two days).<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|259}} The NTSB concluded that it was \"quite possible\" that the explosive residue detected was transferred from military ships or ground vehicles, or the clothing and boots of military personnel, onto the wreckage during or after the recovery operation and was not present when the aircraft crashed into the water.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|259}}\n\nAlthough it was unable to determine the exact source of the trace amounts of explosive residue found on the wreckage, the lack of any other corroborating evidence associated with a high-energy explosion led the NTSB to conclude that \"the in-flight breakup of TWA flight 800 was not initiated by a bomb or missile strike.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|259}}\n\n====Fuel-air explosion in the center wing fuel tank====\n[[File:Center Wing Fuel Tank.png|

recreating the conditions of the flight showed the combination of liquid fuel and fuel/air vapor to be flammable.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|261}} A major reason for the flammability of the

During this time, [[quenching]] was identified as an issue, where the explosion would extinguish itself as it passed through the complex structure of the CWT.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|123}} Because the research data regarding quenching was limited, a complete understanding of quenching behavior was not possible, and the issue of quenching remained unresolved.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|137}}\n\nIn order to better determine whether a fuel/air vapor explosion in the CWT would generate sufficient pressure to break apart the fuel tank and lead to the destruction of the airplane, tests were conducted in July and August 1997, using a retired [[Air France]] 747 at [[Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome|Bruntingthorpe Airfield]], England. These tests simulated a fuel/air explosion in the CWT by igniting a propane/air mixture; this resulted in the failure of the tank structure due to overpressure.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|261}} While the NTSB acknowledged that the test conditions at Bruntingthorpe were not fully comparable to the conditions that existed on TWA 800 at the time of the accident,<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|261}} previous fuel explosions in the CWTs of commercial airliners such as [[Avianca Flight 203]] and [[Philippine Airlines Flight 143]] confirmed that a CWT explosion could break apart the fuel tank and lead to the destruction of an airplane.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|261}}\n\nUltimately, based on \"the accident airplane's breakup sequence; wreckage damage characteristics; scientific tests and research on fuels, fuel tank explosions, and the conditions in the CWT at the time of the accident; and analysis of witness information,\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|271}} the NTSB concluded that \"the TWA flight 800 in-flight breakup was initiated by a fuel/air explosion in the CWT.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|63}}\n\n===In-flight breakup sequence and crippled flight===\n[[File:Slide0045 image013.PNG|thumbnail|right|Slide from NTSB presentation of TWA 800 breakup sequence, illustrating structure and size of CWT.]]\nRecovery locations of the wreckage from the ocean (the red, yellow, and green zones) clearly indicated that: (1) the red area pieces (from the forward portion of the wing center section and a ring of fuselage directly in front) were the earliest pieces to separate from the airplane; (2) the forward fuselage section departed simultaneously with or shortly after the red area pieces, landing relatively intact in the yellow zone; (3) the green area pieces (wings and the aft portion of the fuselage) remained intact for a period after the separation of the forward fuselage, and impacted the water in the green zone.<ref name=\"NTSB Seq pp.3-4\">{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/events/TWA800/exhibits/Ex_18A.pdf |format=PDF|title=Metallurgy/Structures Group Chairman Factual Report Sequencing Study |journal=Docket No. 5A-516, Exhibit No. 18TWA800A |pages=3\u20134 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Twa 800 in-flight breakup.jpg|thumb|left|Frame from the CIA's animated depiction of how TWA Flight 800 broke apart.

to determine whether the aircraft climbed after the nose separated.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|87}} Instead, the NTSB conducted a series of computer simulations to examine the flightpath of the main portion of the fuselage.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|95\u201396}} Hundreds of simulations were run using various combinations of possible times the nose of TWA 800 separated (the exact time

was requested from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).<ref name=\"Tauss CIA report\">{{cite journal|author=Tauss|first=Randolph M.|date=|title=The Crash of TWA Flight 800 - Solving the Mystery

burning fuel coming from the aircraft after the initial explosion.<ref name=\"Tauss CIA report\"/>{{rp|5\u20136}} This conclusion was reached after calculating how long it took for the sound of the initial explosion to reach the witnesses, and using that to correlate the witness observations with the accident sequence.<ref name=\"Tauss CIA report\"/>{{rp|5}} In all cases the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, as the plane had already exploded before their observations began.<ref name=\"Tauss CIA report\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nAs the investigation progressed, the NTSB decided to form a witness group to more fully address the accounts of witnesses.<ref name=\"Witness Report\"/>{{rp|7}} From November 1996 through April 1997 this group reviewed summaries of witness accounts on loan from the FBI (with personal information redacted), and conducted interviews with crewmembers from a [[New York Air National Guard]] [[HH-60]] helicopter and [[C-130]] airplane, as well as a U.S. Navy [[P-3 Orion|P-3]] airplane that was flying in the vicinity of TWA 800 at the time of the accident.<ref name=\"Witness Report\"/>{{rp|7\u20138}}\n\nIn February 1998, the FBI, having closed its active investigation, agreed to fully release the witness summaries to the NTSB.<ref name=\"Witness Report\"/>{{rp|10}} With access to these documents no longer controlled by the FBI, the NTSB formed a second witness group to review the documents.<ref name=\"Witness Report\"/>{{rp|10}} Because of the amount of time that had elapsed (about 21 months) before the NTSB received information about the identity of the witnesses, the witness group chose not to re-interview the witnesses, but instead to rely on the original summaries of witness statements written by FBI agents as the best available evidence of the observations initially reported by the witnesses.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|230}} Despite the two and a half years that had elapsed since the accident, the witness group did interview the captain of Eastwind Airlines Flight 507, who was the first to report the explosion of TWA 800, because of his vantage point and experience as an airline pilot.<ref name=\"Witness Report\"/>{{rp|12}}\n[[File:TWA NTSB.png|thumb|A frame from the NTSB's animation depicting how the noseless plane climbed erratically before descending into the ocean]]\nThe NTSB's review of the released witness documents determined that they contained 736 witness accounts, of which 258 were characterized as \"streak of light\" witnesses (\"an object moving in the sky... variously described [as] a point of light, fireworks, a flare, a shooting star, or something similar.\")<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|230}} The NTSB Witness Group concluded that the streak of light reported by witnesses might have been the actual airplane during some stage of its flight before the fireball developed, noting that most of the 258 streak of light accounts were generally consistent with the calculated flightpath of the accident airplane after the CWT explosion.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|262}}\n\nThirty-eight witnesses described a streak of light that ascended vertically, or nearly so, and these accounts \"seem[ed] to be inconsistent with the accident airplane's flightpath.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|265}} In addition, 18 witnesses reported seeing a streak of light that originated at the surface, or the horizon, which did not \"appear to be consistent with the airplane's calculated flightpath and other known aspects of the accident sequence.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|265}} Regarding these differing accounts, the NTSB noted that based on their experience in previous investigations \"witness reports are often inconsistent with the known facts or with other witnesses' reports of the same events.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|237}} The interviews conducted by the FBI focused on the possibility of a missile attack; suggested interview questions given to FBI agents such as \"Where was the sun in relation to the aircraft and the missile launch point?\" and \"How long did the missile fly?\" could have biased interviewees' responses in some cases.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|266}} The NTSB concluded that given the large number of witnesses in this case, they \"did not expect all of the documented witness observations to be consistent with one another\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|269}} and \"did not view these apparently anomalous witness reports as persuasive evidence that some witnesses might have observed a missile.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}}\n\nAfter missile visibility tests were conducted in April 2000, at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]],<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|254}} the NTSB determined that if witnesses had observed a missile attack they would have seen:\n# a light from the burning missile motor ascending very rapidly and steeply for about 8 seconds;\n# the light disappearing for up to 7 seconds;\n# upon the missile striking the aircraft and igniting the CWT, another light, moving considerably more slowly and more laterally than the first, for about 30 seconds;\n# this light descending while simultaneously developing into a fireball falling toward the ocean.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}} None of the witness documents described such a scenario.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}}\n[[File:Twa n93119 wing explosion.jpg|thumb|left|Another frame from the CIA's animation depicting how the left wing of TWA Flight 800 sheared off and created a second fireball]]\nBecause of their unique vantage points or the level of precision and detail provided in their accounts, five witness accounts generated special interest:<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|242\u2013243}} the pilot of Eastwind Airlines Flight 507, the crew members in the HH-60 helicopter, a streak-of-light witness aboard [[US Airways]] Flight 217, a land witness on the Beach Lane Bridge in [[Westhampton Beach, New York]], and a witness on a boat near Great Gun Beach.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|243\u2013247}} Advocates of a missile-attack scenario asserted that some of these witnesses observed a missile;<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|264}} analysis demonstrated that the observations were not consistent with a missile attack on TWA&nbsp;800, but instead were consistent with these witnesses having observed part of the in-flight fire and breakup sequence after the CWT explosion.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|264}}\n\nThe NTSB concluded that \"the witness observations of a streak of light were not related to a missile and that the streak of light reported by most of these witnesses was burning fuel from the accident airplane in crippled flight during some portion of the post-explosion, preimpact breakup sequence\".<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}} The NTSB further concluded that \"the witnesses' observations of one or more fireballs were of the airplane's burning wreckage falling toward the ocean\".<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}}\n\n===Possible ignition sources of the center wing fuel tank===\nTo determine what ignited the flammable fuel-air vapor in the CWT and caused the explosion, the NTSB evaluated numerous potential ignition sources. All but one were considered very unlikely to have been the source of ignition.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|279}}\n\n====Missile fragment or small explosive charge====\nAlthough the NTSB had already reached the conclusion that a missile strike did not cause the structural failure of the airplane, the possibility that a missile could have exploded close enough to TWA&nbsp;800 for a missile fragment to have entered the CWT and ignited the fuel/air vapor, yet far enough away not to have left any damage characteristic of a missile strike, was considered.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|272}} Computer simulations using missile performance data simulated a missile detonating in a location such that a fragment from the warhead could penetrate the CWT.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|273}} Based on these simulations, the NTSB concluded that it was \"very unlikely\" that a warhead detonated in such a location where a fragment could penetrate the CWT, but no other fragments impact the surrounding airplane structure leaving distinctive impact marks.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|273}}\n\nSimilarly, the investigation considered the possibility that a small explosive charge placed on the CWT could have been the ignition source.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|273}} Testing by the NTSB and the British [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] demonstrated that when metal of the same type and thickness of the CWT was penetrated by a small charge, there was petalling of the surface where the charge was placed, pitting on the adjacent surfaces, and visible hot gas washing damage in the surrounding area.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|273\u2013274}} Since none of the recovered CWT wreckage exhibited these damage characteristics, and none of the areas of missing wreckage were large enough to encompass all the expected damage, the investigation concluded that this scenario was \"very unlikely.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|274}}\n\n====Other potential sources====\nThe NTSB also investigated whether the fuel/air mixture in the CWT could have been ignited by [[lightning strike]], [[meteor strike]], [[auto ignition|auto-ignition]] or hot surface ignition, a fire migrating to the CWT from another fuel tank via the vent system, an uncontained engine failure, a turbine burst in the air conditioning packs beneath the CWT, a malfunctioning CWT jettison/override pump, a malfunctioning CWT scavenger pump, or [[static electricity]].<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|272\u2013279}} After analysis the investigation determined that these potential sources were \"very unlikely\" to have been the source of ignition.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|279}}\n\n====Fuel quantity indication system====\nBecause a combustible fuel/air mixture will always exist in fuel tanks, Boeing designers had attempted to eliminate all possible sources of ignition in the 747's tanks. To do so, all devices are protected from vapor intrusion, and voltages and currents used by the Fuel Quantity Indication System (FQIS) are kept very low. In the case of the 747-100 series, the only wiring located inside the CWT is that which is associated with the FQIS.\n\nIn order for the FQIS to have been Flight 800's ignition source, a transfer of higher-than-normal voltage to the FQIS would have needed to occur, as well as some mechanism whereby the excess energy was released by the FQIS wiring into the CWT. While the NTSB determined that factors suggesting the likelihood of a short circuit event existed, they added that \"neither the release mechanism nor the location of the ignition inside the CWT could be determined from the available evidence.\" Nonetheless, the NTSB concluded that \"the ignition energy for the CWT explosion most likely entered the CWT through the FQIS wiring\".\n\nThough the FQIS itself was designed to prevent danger by minimizing voltages and currents, the innermost tube of Flight 800's FQIS compensator showed damage similar to that of the compensator tube identified as the ignition source for the [[Imperial_Iranian_Air_Force_Flight_ULF48|surge tank fire that destroyed a 747 near Madrid in 1976]].<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|293\u2013294}} This was not considered proof of a source of ignition. Evidence of arcing was found in a wire bundle that included FQIS wiring connecting to the center wing tank.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|288}} Arcing signs were also seen on two wires sharing a cable raceway with FQIS wiring at station 955.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|288}}\n\nThe captain's cockpit voice recorder channel showed two \"dropouts\" of background power harmonics in the second before the recording ended (with the separation of the nose).<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|289}} This might well be the signature of an arc on cockpit wiring adjacent to the FQIS wiring. The captain commented on the \"crazy\" readings of the number 4 engine fuel flow gauge about 2&thinsp;1/2 minutes before the CVR recording ended.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|290}} Finally, the Center Wing Tank fuel quantity gauge was recovered and indicated 640&nbsp;pounds instead of the 300&nbsp;pounds that had been loaded into that tank.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|290}} Experiments showed that applying power to a wire leading to the fuel quantity gauge can cause the digital display to change by several hundred pounds before the circuit breaker trips. Thus the gauge anomaly could have been caused by a short to the FQIS wiring.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|290}} The NTSB concluded that the most likely source of sufficient voltage to cause ignition was a short from damaged wiring, or within electrical components of the FQIS. As not all components and wiring were recovered, it was not possible to pinpoint the source of the necessary voltage.\n\n==Report conclusions==\nThe NTSB investigation ended with the adoption of the board's final report on August 23, 2000. The Board determined that the probable cause of the TWA 800 accident was:<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|308}}\n{{quote|[An] explosion of the center wing fuel tank (CWT), resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty, but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the CWT that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system.}}\n\nIn addition to the probable cause, the NTSB found the following contributing factors to the accident:<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|308}}\n{{quote|\n* The design and certification concept that fuel tank explosions could be prevented solely by precluding all ignition sources.\n* The certification of the Boeing 747 with heat sources located beneath the CWT with no means to reduce the heat transferred into the CWT or to render the fuel tank vapor non-combustible.|sign=|source=}}\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, and in its final report, the NTSB issued fifteen safety recommendations, mostly covering fuel tank and wiring-related issues.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|309\u2013312}} Among the recommendations was that significant consideration should be given to the development of modifications such as [[inerting system|nitrogen-inerting systems]] for new airplane designs and, where feasible, for existing airplanes.<ref name=\"A-96-174-177\">{{cite web|url=http://ntsb.gov/recs/letters/1996/a96_174_177.pdf|title=National Transportation Safety Board Safety Recommendation|author=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608081653/http://www.ntsb.gov/Recs/letters/1996/A96_174_177.pdf|archivedate=June 8, 2010|accessdate=January 16, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{rp|6}}\n\n===Controversy===\nThe NTSB's conclusions about the cause of the TWA 800 disaster took four years and one month to be published.

the possibility that the explosive residue was due to contamination from the aircraft's use in 1991 transporting troops during the [[Gulf War]] or its use in a dog-training explosive detection exercise about one month before the accident.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|258\u2013259}} Testing conducted by the FAA's Technical Center indicated that residues of the type of explosives found on the wreckage would dissipate completely after two days of immersion in sea water (almost all recovered wreckage was immersed longer than two days).<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|259}} The NTSB concluded that it was \"quite possible\" that the explosive residue detected was transferred from military ships or ground vehicles, or the clothing and boots of military personnel, onto the wreckage during or after the recovery operation and was not present when the aircraft crashed into the water.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|259}}\n\nAlthough it was unable to determine the exact source of the trace amounts of explosive residue found on the wreckage, the lack of any other corroborating evidence associated with a high-energy explosion led the NTSB to conclude that \"the in-flight breakup

recreating the conditions of the flight showed the combination of liquid fuel and fuel/air vapor to be flammable.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|261}} A major reason for the flammability of the

with the CWT temperature raised to a sufficient level, a single ignition source could cause an explosion.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|298}}\n\nComputer modeling<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|122\u2013123}} and scale-model testing<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|123}} were used to predict and demonstrate how an explosion would progress in a 747 CWT. During this time, [[quenching]] was identified as an issue, where the explosion would extinguish itself as it passed through the complex structure of the CWT.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|123}} Because the research data regarding quenching was limited, a complete understanding of quenching behavior was not possible, and the issue of quenching remained unresolved.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|137}}\n\nIn order to better determine whether a fuel/air vapor explosion in the CWT would generate sufficient pressure to break apart the fuel tank and lead to the destruction of the airplane, tests were conducted in July and August 1997, using a retired [[Air France]] 747 at [[Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome|Bruntingthorpe Airfield]], England. These tests simulated a fuel/air explosion in the CWT by igniting a propane/air mixture; this resulted in the failure of the tank structure due to overpressure.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|261}} While the NTSB acknowledged that the test conditions at Bruntingthorpe were not fully comparable to the conditions that existed on TWA 800 at the time of the accident,<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|261}} previous fuel explosions in the CWTs of commercial airliners such as [[Avianca Flight 203]] and [[Philippine Airlines Flight 143]] confirmed that a CWT explosion could break apart the fuel tank and lead to the destruction of an airplane.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|261}}\n\nUltimately, based on \"the accident airplane's breakup sequence; wreckage damage characteristics; scientific tests and research on fuels, fuel tank explosions, and the conditions in the CWT at the time of the accident; and analysis of witness information,\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|271}} the NTSB concluded that \"the TWA flight 800 in-flight breakup was initiated by a fuel/air explosion in the CWT.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|63}}\n\n===In-flight breakup sequence and crippled flight===\n[[File:Slide0045 image013.PNG|thumbnail|right|Slide from NTSB presentation of TWA 800 breakup sequence, illustrating structure and size of CWT.]]\nRecovery locations of the wreckage from the ocean (the red, yellow, and green zones) clearly indicated that: (1) the red area pieces (from the forward portion of the wing center section and a ring of fuselage directly in front) were the earliest pieces to separate from the airplane; (2) the forward fuselage section departed simultaneously with or shortly after the red area pieces, landing relatively intact in the yellow zone; (3) the green area pieces (wings and the aft portion of the fuselage) remained intact for a period after the separation of the forward fuselage, and impacted the water in the green zone.<ref name=\"NTSB Seq pp.3-4\">{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/events/TWA800/exhibits/Ex_18A.pdf |format=PDF|title=Metallurgy/Structures Group Chairman Factual Report Sequencing Study |journal=Docket No. 5A-516, Exhibit No. 18TWA800A |pages=3\u20134 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Twa 800 in-flight breakup.jpg|thumb|left|Frame from the CIA's animated depiction of how TWA Flight 800 broke apart.

to determine whether the aircraft climbed after the nose separated.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|87}} Instead, the NTSB conducted a series of computer simulations to examine the flightpath of the main portion of the fuselage.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|95\u201396}} Hundreds of simulations were run using various combinations of possible times the nose of TWA 800 separated (the exact time was unknown), different models of the behavior of the crippled aircraft (the aerodynamic properties of the aircraft without its nose could only be estimated), and longitudinal radar data (the recorded radar tracks of the east/west position of TWA 800 from various sites differed).<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|96\u201397}} These simulations indicated that after the loss of the forward fuselage the

was requested from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).<ref name=\"Tauss CIA report\">{{cite journal|author=Tauss|first=Randolph M.|date=|title=The Crash of TWA Flight 800 - Solving the Mystery

2011|via=}}</ref>{{rp|2}} CIA analysts, relying on sound-propagation analysis, concluded that the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, but were seeing a trail of burning fuel coming from the aircraft after the initial explosion.<ref name=\"Tauss CIA report\"/>{{rp|5\u20136}} This conclusion was reached after calculating how long it took for the sound of the initial explosion to reach the witnesses, and using that to correlate the witness observations with the accident sequence.<ref name=\"Tauss CIA report\"/>{{rp|5}} In all cases the witnesses could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, as the plane had already exploded before their observations began.<ref name=\"Tauss CIA report\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nAs the investigation progressed, the NTSB decided to form a witness group to more fully address the accounts of witnesses.<ref name=\"Witness Report\"/>{{rp|7}} From November 1996 through April 1997 this group reviewed summaries of witness accounts on loan from the FBI (with personal information redacted), and conducted interviews with crewmembers from a [[New York Air National Guard]] [[HH-60]] helicopter and [[C-130]] airplane, as well as a U.S. Navy [[P-3 Orion|P-3]] airplane that was flying in the vicinity of TWA 800 at the time of the accident.<ref name=\"Witness Report\"/>{{rp|7\u20138}}\n\nIn February 1998, the FBI, having closed its active investigation, agreed to fully release the witness summaries to the NTSB.<ref name=\"Witness Report\"/>{{rp|10}} With access to these documents no longer controlled by the FBI, the NTSB formed a second witness group to review the documents.<ref name=\"Witness Report\"/>{{rp|10}} Because of the amount of time that had elapsed (about 21 months) before the NTSB received information about the identity of the witnesses, the witness group chose not to re-interview the witnesses, but instead to rely on the original summaries of witness statements written by FBI agents as the best available evidence of the observations initially reported by the witnesses.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|230}} Despite the two and a half years that had elapsed since the accident, the witness group did interview the captain of Eastwind Airlines Flight 507, who was the first to report the explosion of TWA 800, because of his vantage point and experience as an airline pilot.<ref name=\"Witness Report\"/>{{rp|12}}\n[[File:TWA NTSB.png|thumb|A frame from the NTSB's animation depicting how the noseless plane climbed erratically before descending into the ocean]]\nThe NTSB's review of the released witness documents determined that they contained 736 witness accounts, of which 258 were characterized as \"streak of light\" witnesses (\"an object moving in the sky... variously described [as] a point of light, fireworks, a flare, a shooting star, or something similar.\")<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|230}} The NTSB Witness Group concluded that the streak of light reported by witnesses might have been the actual airplane during some stage of its flight before the fireball developed, noting that most of the 258 streak of light accounts were generally consistent with the calculated flightpath of the accident airplane after the CWT explosion.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|262}}\n\nThirty-eight witnesses described a streak of light that ascended vertically, or nearly so, and these accounts \"seem[ed] to be inconsistent with the accident airplane's flightpath.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|265}} In addition, 18 witnesses reported seeing a streak of light that originated at the surface, or the horizon, which did not \"appear to be consistent with the airplane's calculated flightpath and other known aspects of the accident sequence.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|265}} Regarding these differing accounts, the NTSB noted that based on their experience in previous investigations \"witness reports are often inconsistent with the known facts or with other witnesses' reports of the same events.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|237}} The interviews conducted by the FBI focused on the possibility of a missile attack; suggested interview questions given to FBI agents such as \"Where was the sun in relation to the aircraft and the missile launch point?\" and \"How long did the missile fly?\" could have biased interviewees' responses in some cases.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|266}} The NTSB concluded that given the large number of witnesses in this case, they \"did not expect all of the documented witness observations to be consistent with one another\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|269}} and \"did not view these apparently anomalous witness reports as persuasive evidence that some witnesses might have observed a missile.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}}\n\nAfter missile visibility tests were conducted in April 2000, at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]],<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|254}} the NTSB determined that if witnesses had observed a missile attack they would have seen:\n# a light from the burning missile motor ascending very rapidly and steeply for about 8 seconds;\n# the light disappearing for up to 7 seconds;\n# upon the missile striking the aircraft and igniting the CWT, another light, moving considerably more slowly and more laterally than the first, for about 30 seconds;\n# this light descending while simultaneously developing into a fireball falling toward the ocean.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}} None of the witness documents described such a scenario.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}}\n[[File:Twa n93119 wing explosion.jpg|thumb|left|Another frame from the CIA's animation depicting how the left wing of TWA Flight 800 sheared off and created a second fireball]]\nBecause of their unique vantage points or the level of precision and detail provided in their accounts, five witness accounts generated special interest:<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|242\u2013243}} the pilot of Eastwind Airlines Flight 507, the crew members in the HH-60 helicopter, a streak-of-light witness aboard [[US Airways]] Flight 217, a land witness on the Beach Lane Bridge in [[Westhampton Beach, New York]], and a witness on a boat near Great Gun Beach.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|243\u2013247}} Advocates of a missile-attack scenario asserted that some of these witnesses observed a missile;<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|264}} analysis demonstrated that the observations were not consistent with a missile attack on TWA&nbsp;800, but instead were consistent with these witnesses having observed part of the in-flight fire and breakup sequence after the CWT explosion.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|264}}\n\nThe NTSB concluded that \"the witness observations of a streak of light were not related to a missile and that the streak of light reported by most of these witnesses was burning fuel from the accident airplane in crippled flight during some portion of the post-explosion, preimpact breakup sequence\".<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}} The NTSB further concluded that \"the witnesses' observations of one or more fireballs were of the airplane's burning wreckage falling toward the ocean\".<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|270}}\n\n===Possible ignition sources of the center wing fuel tank===\nTo determine what ignited the flammable fuel-air vapor in the CWT and caused the explosion, the NTSB evaluated numerous potential ignition sources. All but one were considered very unlikely to have been the source of ignition.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|279}}\n\n====Missile fragment or small explosive charge====\nAlthough the NTSB had already reached the conclusion that a missile strike did not cause the structural failure of the airplane, the possibility that a missile could have exploded close enough to TWA&nbsp;800 for a missile fragment to have entered the CWT and ignited the fuel/air vapor, yet far enough away not to have left any damage characteristic of a missile strike, was considered.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|272}} Computer simulations using missile performance data simulated a missile detonating in a location such that a fragment from the warhead could penetrate the CWT.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|273}} Based on these simulations, the NTSB concluded that it was \"very unlikely\" that a warhead detonated in such a location where a fragment could penetrate the CWT, but no other fragments impact the surrounding airplane structure leaving distinctive impact marks.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|273}}\n\nSimilarly, the investigation considered the possibility that a small explosive charge placed on the CWT could have been the ignition source.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|273}} Testing by the NTSB and the British [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] demonstrated that when metal of the same type and thickness of the CWT was penetrated by a small charge, there was petalling of the surface where the charge was placed, pitting on the adjacent surfaces, and visible hot gas washing damage in the surrounding area.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|273\u2013274}} Since none of the recovered CWT wreckage exhibited these damage characteristics, and none of the areas of missing wreckage were large enough to encompass all the expected damage, the investigation concluded that this scenario was \"very unlikely.\"<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|274}}\n\n====Other potential sources====\nThe NTSB also investigated whether the fuel/air mixture in the CWT could have been ignited by [[lightning strike]], [[meteor strike]], [[auto ignition|auto-ignition]] or hot surface ignition, a fire migrating to the CWT from another fuel tank via the vent system, an uncontained engine failure, a turbine burst in the air conditioning packs beneath the CWT, a malfunctioning CWT jettison/override pump, a malfunctioning CWT scavenger pump, or [[static electricity]].<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|272\u2013279}} After analysis the investigation determined that these potential sources were \"very unlikely\" to have been the source of ignition.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|279}}\n\n====Fuel quantity indication system====\nBecause a combustible fuel/air mixture will always exist in fuel tanks, Boeing designers had attempted to eliminate all possible sources of ignition in the 747's tanks. To do so, all devices are protected from vapor intrusion, and voltages and currents used by the Fuel Quantity Indication System (FQIS) are kept very low. In the case of the 747-100 series, the only wiring located inside the CWT is that which is associated with the FQIS.\n\nIn order for the FQIS to have been Flight 800's ignition source, a transfer of higher-than-normal voltage to the FQIS would have needed to occur, as well as some mechanism whereby the excess energy was released by the FQIS wiring into the CWT. While the NTSB determined that factors suggesting the likelihood of a short circuit event existed, they added that \"neither the release mechanism nor the location of the ignition inside the CWT could be determined from the available evidence.\" Nonetheless, the NTSB concluded that \"the ignition energy for the CWT explosion most likely entered the CWT through the FQIS wiring\".\n\nThough the FQIS itself was designed to prevent danger by minimizing voltages and currents, the innermost tube of Flight 800's FQIS compensator showed damage similar to that of the compensator tube identified as the ignition source for the [[Imperial_Iranian_Air_Force_Flight_ULF48|surge tank fire that destroyed a 747 near Madrid in 1976]].<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|293\u2013294}} This was not considered proof of a source of ignition. Evidence of arcing was found in a wire bundle that included FQIS wiring connecting to the center wing tank.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|288}} Arcing signs were also seen on two wires sharing a cable raceway with FQIS wiring at station 955.<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|288}}\n\nThe captain's cockpit voice recorder channel showed two \"dropouts\" of background power harmonics in the second before the recording ended (with the separation of the nose).<ref name=\"Final Report\"/>{{rp|289}} This might well be the signature of an arc on cockpit wiring adjacent to the FQIS wiring.

A metameme is a two-level message that punctures a specific commercial image, but does so in a way that challenges some larger aspect of the political culture of corporate domination.<ref name=\"website\"/> An example would be the \"true cost\" campaign set in motion by Adbusters. \"True Cost\" forced consumers to compare the human labor cost and conditions and environmental drawbacks of products to the sales costs. Another example would be the \"Truth\" campaigns that frequented television in the past years that exposed the deception tobacco companies used to sell their products.\n\nFollowing critical scholars like [[Paulo Freire]], Culture jams are also being Integrated into the university classroom \"setting in which students and teachers gain the opportunity not only to learn methods of informed public critique, but also to collaboratively use participatory communication techniques to actively create new locations of meaning.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> For example, students disrupt public space to bring attention to community concerns or utilize subvertisments to engage with [[media literacy]] projects.\n\n===Examples===\n{{Main|List of culture jamming organizations and people}}\n* [[Artivist]]\n* [[Billboard hacking]]\n* [[Broadcast signal intrusion]]\n* [[Flash mob]]\n* [[Happening]]\n* [[List of practical joke topics|Practical joke topics]]\n* ''[[Steal This Book]]''\n\n;Groups\n* [[Guerrilla Girls]]\n* [[The Yes Men]]\n* [[Billboard Liberation Front]]\n* [[Crimethinc]]\n* [[Merry Pranksters]]\n* [[Operation Mindfuck]]\n* [[Billboard Utilising Graffitists Against Unhealthy Promotions]]\n\n==Criticism==\nCulture jamming is sometimes confused with [[Appropriation (art)|artistic appropriation]] or with acts of [[vandalism]] which have destruction or defacement as their primary goal.  Although the end result is not always easily distinguishable from these activities, the intent of those participating in culture jamming differs from that of people whose intent is either artistic or merely destructive.  The lines are not always clear-cut; some activities, notably [[street art]], will fall into two or even all three categories.\n\nWith the rise of the anti-corporate globalization movement at the turn of the century the possibilities as well as limits of culture jamming as originally conceived have become apparent. The joyful images of \"Teamsters and Turtles\" during the iconic November 1999 anti-WTO protests in Seattle, Washington and the clowns and samba bands as well as highly inventive music and art generated in subsequent protests showed the possibilities of culture jamming to amplify both critical messages and solidarity among protesters and with the broader public. On the other hand, especially after the September 11 attacks and the rise but ultimate failure of the anti-Iraq war movement the limits of the understanding and deployment of culture jamming primarily as a tool of defense and critique -- \"jamming\" the messages of the corporate/military system\u2014became increasingly apparent. This coincided with a realization among critical members of the emerging global peace and justice movement of the inherent (if largely unnoticed and unacknowledged) myopia and prejudices against Middle Eastern/Muslim and other marginalized non-Euro-American cultures and communities by the movement, a realization that became an important issue of contention within the [[World Social Forum]]s first held in 2001. In that regard, some scholars and activists argue that culture jamming is easily co-opted and commodified by the market, which tends to \"defuse\" its potential for consumer resistance.<ref name=\"Rumbo\">Rumbo, Joseph D. (2002) \"Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters\", Psychology & Marketing 19(2): 127\u201348.</ref> Others posit that the culture jamming strategy of rhetorical sabotage, used by Adbusters, is easily incorporated and appropriated by clever advertising agencies, and thus is not a very powerful means of social change.<ref name=\"harold\"/> More positively, some practitioners have called for moving beyond the negative sense of \"jamming\" to the more positive, musical understanding of the term that would encourage artists, scholars and activists to come together and literally \"jam\" in the best musical sense of the term\u2014to synergize and in so doing augment and amplify their experiences and ideas to create new, innovative, flexible and praxically mobile art, intellectual and political concepts, strategies and actions that together would offer deeper, more compelling and even transformational visions of futures in which, as the Zapatistas have taught, many worlds are possible.<ref name=\"LeVine\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Doppelg\u00e4nger brand image]]\n* [[Subvertising]]\n* [[Banksy]]\n* [[Critical theory]]\n* [[The Firesign Theatre]]\n* [[Minority influence]]\n* [[Tactical media]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Branwyn, Gareth (1996).

Culture jamming makes use of the technique ''[[d\u00e9tournement]]'', which uses the language and [[rhetoric]] of the mainstream paradigm or culture to subversively critique that paradigm or culture. Tactics include editing [[Logo|logos]] to critique the company, product, or concept they represent, or wearing [[fashion]] statements which criticize the current fashion trends by deliberately clashing with them.<ref name=\"Boden\">Boden, Sharon and Williams, Simon J. (2002) \"Consumption and Emotion: The Romantic Ethic Revisited\", Sociology 36(3):493\u2013512</ref>  Culture jamming often entails using [[mass media]] to produce [[Irony|ironic]] or [[satirical]] commentary about itself, commonly using the original medium's communication method.\n\nCulture jamming is employed as a reaction against social [[conformity]].  Prominent examples of culture jamming include the adulteration of [[Billboard|billboard advertising]] by the [[Billboard Liberation Front]] (BLF), and [[List of contemporary artists#E|contemporary artists]] such as [[Ron English (artist)|Ron English]].  Culture jamming may involve street parties and [[Protest|protests]].  While culture jamming usually focuses on subverting or critiquing political and advertising messages, some proponents focus on a more positive (often musically inspired) form which brings together artists, scholars, and activists to create new types of cultural production that transcend \u2013 rather than merely criticize \u2013 the status quo.<ref name=\"LeVine\">LeVine, Mark (2005)'' Why They Don't Hate Us: Lifting the Veil on the Axis of Evil''.

The SI asserted that in the past humans dealt with life and the consumer market directly. They argued that this spontaneous way of life was slowly deteriorating as a direct result of the new \"modern\" way of life. Situationists saw everything from television to radio as a threat<ref name =\"Lasn\">Lasn, Kalle (1999) Culture Jam: How to Reverse America's Suicidal Consumer Binge \u2013 And Why We Must. New York: HarperCollins</ref> and argued that life in industrialized areas, driven by capitalist forces, had become monotonous, sterile, gloomy, linear, and productivity driven. In particular, the SI argued humans had become passive recipients of ''the'' ''[[The Society of the Spectacle|spectacle]]'',  a simulated reality that generates the desire to consume, and positions humans as obedient consumerist cogs within the efficient and exploitative productivity loop of capitalism.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title = Society of the spectacle|last = Debord|first = Guy|publisher = Black and Red|year = 1983|isbn = |location = Detroit|pages = }}</ref> Through playful activity, individuals could create ''[[Situationist prank|situations]]'', the opposite of spectacles.  For the SI, these situations took the form of the ''[[d\u00e9rive]]'', or the active drift of the body through space in ways that broke routine and overcame boundaries, creating situations by exiting habit and entering new interactive possibilities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe cultural critic [[Mark Dery]] traces the origins of culture jamming to medieval carnival, which [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] interpreted, in ''Rabelais and his World,'' as an officially sanctioned subversion of the social hierarchy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Modern precursors might include: the media-savvy agit-prop of the anti-Nazi photomonteur [[John Heartfield]], the sociopolitical street theater and staged media events of 1960s radicals such as [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Joey Skaggs]], the [[Germany|German]] concept of [[Spa\u00dfguerilla]], and in the [[Situationist International]] (SI) of the 1950s and 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The SI first compared its own activities to [[radio jamming]] in 1968, when it proposed the use of [[guerrilla communication]] within [[mass media]] to sow confusion within the dominant culture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In 1985, the [[Guerrilla Girls]] formed to expose discrimination and corruption in the [[art world]].<ref>[http://markdery.com:?page_id=154 Mark Dery.\"A Brief Introduction to the 2010 Reprint (open source).\" ''Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of Signs'']</ref>\n\nMark Dery's ''[[New York Times]]'' article on culture jamming, \"The Merry Pranksters And the Art of the Hoax\"<ref name=\"Dery90Nyt\">[[Mark Dery|Dery, Mark]] (1990)[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DF123EF930A15751C1A966958260&pagewanted=all ''The Merry Pranksters And the Art of the Hoax''], NYtimes article, December 23, 1990.</ref> was the first mention, in the mainstream media, of the phenomenon; Dery later expanded on this article in his 1993 Open Magazine pamphlet, ''Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of the Signs'',<ref name=\"Dery93OpenMag\">Dery, Mark (1993) [http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/culture_jamming.html ''Culture Jamming: Hacking, Slashing, and Sniping in the Empire of the Signs]'', in ''Open Magazine Pamphlet Series'', 1993</ref> a seminal essay that remains the most exhaustive historical, sociopolitical, and philosophical theorization of culture jamming to date.

Another example would be the \"Truth\" campaigns that frequented television in the past years that exposed the deception tobacco companies used to sell their products.\n\nFollowing critical scholars like [[Paulo Freire]], Culture jams are also being Integrated into the university classroom \"setting in which students and teachers gain the opportunity not only to learn methods of informed public critique, but also to collaboratively use participatory communication techniques to actively create new locations of meaning.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> For example, students disrupt public space to bring attention to community concerns or utilize subvertisments to engage with [[media literacy]] projects.\n\n===Examples===\n{{Main|List of culture jamming organizations and people}}\n* [[Artivist]]\n* [[Billboard hacking]]\n* [[Broadcast signal intrusion]]\n* [[Flash mob]]\n* [[Happening]]\n* [[List of practical joke topics|Practical joke topics]]\n* ''[[Steal This Book]]''\n\n;Groups\n* [[Guerrilla Girls]]\n* [[The Yes Men]]\n* [[Billboard Liberation Front]]\n* [[Crimethinc]]\n* [[Merry Pranksters]]\n* [[Operation Mindfuck]]\n* [[Billboard Utilising Graffitists Against Unhealthy Promotions]]\n\n==Criticism==\nCulture jamming is sometimes confused with [[Appropriation (art)|artistic appropriation]] or with acts of [[vandalism]] which have destruction or defacement as their primary goal.  Although the end result is not always easily distinguishable from these activities, the intent of those participating in culture jamming differs from that of people whose intent is either artistic or merely destructive.  The lines are not always clear-cut; some activities, notably [[street art]], will fall into two or even all three categories.\n\nWith the rise of the anti-corporate globalization movement at the turn of the century the possibilities as well as limits of culture jamming as originally conceived have become apparent. The joyful images of \"Teamsters and Turtles\" during the iconic November 1999 anti-WTO protests in Seattle, Washington and the clowns and samba bands as well as highly inventive music and art generated in subsequent protests showed the possibilities of culture jamming to amplify both critical messages and solidarity among protesters and with the broader public. On the other hand, especially after the September 11 attacks and the rise but ultimate failure of the anti-Iraq war movement the limits of the understanding and deployment of culture jamming primarily as a tool of defense and critique -- \"jamming\" the messages of the corporate/military system -- became increasingly apparent. This coincided with a realization among critical members of the emerging global peace and justice movement of the inherent (if largely unnoticed and unacknowledged) myopia and prejudices against Middle Eastern/Muslim and other marginalized non-Euro-American cultures and communities by the movement, a realization that became an important issue of contention within the [[World_Social_Forum|World Social Forums]] first held in 2001. In that regard, some scholars and activists argue that culture jamming is easily co-opted and commodified by the market, which tends to \"defuse\" its potential for consumer resistance.<ref name=\"Rumbo\">Rumbo, Joseph D. (2002) \"Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters\", Psychology & Marketing 19(2): 127\u201348.</ref> Others posit that the culture jamming strategy of rhetorical sabotage, used by Adbusters, is easily incorporated and appropriated by clever advertising agencies, and thus is not a very powerful means of social change.<ref name=\"harold\"/> More positively, some practitioners have called for moving beyond the negative sense of \"jamming\" to the more positive, musical understanding of the term that would encourage artists, scholars and activists to come together and literally \"jam\" in the best musical sense of the term -- to synergize and in so doing augment and amplify their experiences and ideas to create new, innovative, flexible and praxically mobile art, intellectual and political concepts, strategies and actions that together would offer deeper, more compelling and even transformational visions of futures in which, as the Zapatistas have taught, many worlds are possible.<ref name=\"LeVine\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Doppelg\u00e4nger brand image]]\n* [[Subvertising]]\n* [[Banksy]]\n* [[Critical theory]]\n* [[The Firesign Theatre]]\n* [[Minority influence]]\n* [[Tactical media]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Branwyn, Gareth (1996).

Having solved the open problem posed by Davenport on [[Waring's problem|writing numbers as the sums of fifth powers]], Conway began to become interested in infinite ordinals. It appears that his interest in games began during his years studying the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]], where he became an avid [[backgammon]] player, spending hours playing the game in the common room. He was awarded his doctorate in 1964 and was appointed as College Fellow and Lecturer in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.\n\nAfter leaving Cambridge in 1986, he took up the appointment to the [[John von Neumann]] Chair of Mathematics at Princeton University.\n\n==Conway's Game of Life==\n{{Main|Conway's Game of Life}}\n[[File:Gospers glider gun.gif|thumb|right|A single [[Bill Gosper|Gosper]]'s [[Gun (cellular automaton)|Glider Gun]] creating \"[[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]]\" in [[Conway's Game of Life]]]]\nConway is especially known for the invention of the Game of Life, one of the early examples of a [[cellular automaton]].

''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway is widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe is also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings. See Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2013[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that in which every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers, each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B.

''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway is widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe is also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings. See Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2013[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that in which every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers, each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the '[[Hidden variable theory|no hidden variables]]' principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">\n[https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners London Mathematical Society Prizewinners]</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

Each member of an idol group has his or her own character to play and therefore an important part of their job duties is to maintain that temperament in any kind of exposure they may get. One way to build personal image of idol groups is through social media services with contents taken care by the company to make sure the consistency of these personal characteristics.<ref name=\":2\">Elfving-Hwang, Joanna. \"K-pop Idols, Artificial Beauty and Affective Fan Relationships in South Korea.\" in ''Routledge Handbook of Celebrity Studies'', edited by Anthony Elliott. London:  Routledge, 2018.</ref>\n\n== Relationship with fans==\nThe relationship between Korean idols and their fans can be characterized as \"parasocial kin\", which means for fans to create a familial connection with their idols rather than just being a \u201clook-from-afar\u201d fan. In some cases, within and outside of fandoms, fans also create familial connections with other fans through similar interests or just to make friends. These interactions can be initiated by the fans, the company, or the idols themselves, where they would most likely still have to go through their company to be approved. Some projects or activities, created by fans for the idols, must also be approved by the venue or the idols\u2019 company to minimize any harm to the idols and fan-participants. Interactions and fan connections can be seen through events like fan meetings, also known as artist engagements, concerts or fansites, and artist caf\u00e9s. An annual event known as KCon is also a place for fans and artists to interact. The nature of this \"parasocial kin\" relationship can also be seen in the proactive participation of Korean idol fans in production of idol groups. Even before debut, some trainees would already have their own fans. This leads to the \u201ckinship\u201d starting out early, and building that up is very important for the idol as an artist and the fan as a supporter. Once debuted, fans grow alongside their idols and idol-fan relationships become deeper. If anything happens, fans have their own unique ways to show their attitude and opinion on issues concerning \"unfair\" actions of management companies. Under this situation, fans often appear to be protecting idols from company mistreatment due to the familial connection built between both sides.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Working conditions ==\n{{See also|Slave contract}}\nSeveral Korean idol groups and solo artists have resented the contracts issued to them by their management companies, claiming that the decade-long contracts are \"too long, too restrictive, and gave them almost none of the profits from their success\".

Each member of an idol group has his or her own character to play and therefore an important part of their job duties is to maintain that temperament in any kind of exposure they may get. One way to build personal image of idol groups is through social media services with contents taken care by the company to make sure the consistency of these personal characteristics.<ref name=\":2\">Elfving-Hwang, Joanna. \"K-pop Idols, Artificial Beauty and Affective Fan Relationships in South Korea.\" in ''Routledge Handbook of Celebrity Studies'', edited by Anthony Elliott. London:  Routledge, 2018.</ref>\n\n== Relationship with fans==\nThe relationship between Korean idols and their fans can be characterized as \"parasocial kin\", which means for fans to create a familial connection with their idols rather than just being a \u201clook-from-afar\u201d fan. In some cases, within and outside of fandoms, fans also create familial connections with other fans through similar interests or just to make friends. These interactions can be initiated by the fans, the company, or the idols themselves, where they would most likely still have to go through their company to be approved. Some projects or activities, created by fans for the idols, must also be approved by the venue or the idols\u2019 company to minimize any harm to the idols and fan-participants. Interactions and fan connections can be seen through events like fan meetings, also known as artist engagements, concerts or fansites, and artist caf\u00e9s. An annual event known as KCon is also a place for fans and artists to interact. The nature of this \"parasocial kin\" relationship can also be seen in the proactive participation of Korean idol fans in production of idol groups. Even before debut, some trainees would already have their own fans. This leads to the \u201ckinship\u201d starting out early, and building that up is very important for the idol as an artist and the fan as a supporter. Once debuted, fans grow alongside their idols and idol-fan relationships become deeper. If anything happens, fans have their own unique ways to show their attitude and opinion on issues concerning \"unfair\" actions of management companies. Under this situation, fans often appear to be protecting idols from company mistreatment due to the familial connection built between both sides.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Working conditions ==\n{{See also|Slave contract}}\nSeveral Korean idol groups and solo artists have resented the contracts issued to them by their management companies, claiming that the decade-long contracts are \"too long, too restrictive, and gave them almost none of the profits from their success\".

The name was adopted by Iranian tribes which established themselves there in the 9th century B.C.E. in the west and southwest of Urmia lake. The Parsua (P\u0101rsa) are mentioned there for the first time in 843 B.C.E., during the reign of Salmanassar III, and then, after they migrated to the southeast (Boehmer, pp. 193-97), the name was transferred, between 690 and 640, to a region previously called An\u0161an (q.v.) in Elamite sources (Herzfeld, pp. 169-71, 178-79, 186).

In ''How Everyone Became Depressed: The Rise and Fall of the Nervous Breakdown'' (2013), Edward Shorter, a professor of psychiatry and the history of medicine, says:\n{{quote|About half of them are depressed. Or at least that is the diagnosis that they got when they were put on antidepressants. ... They go to work but they are unhappy and uncomfortable; they are somewhat anxious; they are tired; they have various physical pains\u2014and they tend to obsess about the whole business. There is a term for what they have, and it is a good old-fashioned term that has gone out of use. They have nerves or a nervous illness. It is an illness not just of mind or brain, but a disorder of the entire body. ... We have a package here of five symptoms\u2014mild depression, some anxiety, fatigue, somatic pains, and obsessive thinking. ... We have had nervous illness for centuries. When you are too nervous to function ... it is a nervous breakdown. But that term has vanished from medicine, although not from the way we speak. ... The nervous patients of yesteryear are the depressives of today. That is the bad news. ... There is a deeper illness that drives depression and the symptoms of mood. We can call this deeper illness something else, or invent a neologism, but we need to get the discussion off depression and onto this deeper disorder in the brain and body.

Vatz, co-author of explication of views of Thomas Szasz in [[Thomas Szasz]] : \"Primary Values and Major Contentions\"}}\n\n==Classifications==\n{{Main|Classification of mental disorders}}\n\nThere are currently two widely established systems that classify mental disorders:\n* ''[[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders]]'', since 1949 part of the [[International Classification of Diseases]] produced by the WHO,\n*  the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-5) produced by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) since 1952.\n\nBoth of these list categories of disorder and provide standardized criteria for diagnosis. They have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although significant differences remain. Other classification schemes may be used in non-western cultures, for example the ''[[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]]'', and other manuals may be used by those of alternative theoretical persuasions, for example the ''[[Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual]]''. In general, mental disorders are classified separately from [[neurological disorders]], [[learning disabilities]] or [[intellectual disability]].\n\nUnlike the DSM and ICD, some approaches are not based on identifying distinct categories of disorder using [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] symptom profiles intended to separate the abnormal from the normal. There is significant scientific debate about the relative merits of categorical versus such non-categorical (or hybrid) schemes, also known as [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] or dimensional models. A [[spectrum approach]] may incorporate elements of both.\n\nIn the scientific and academic literature on the definition or classification of mental disorder, one extreme argues that it is entirely a matter of value judgements (including of what is [[norm (sociology)|normal]]) while another proposes that it is or could be entirely [[objectivity (science)|objective]] and [[scientific]] (including by reference to statistical norms).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1614.1999.00555.x |title=Classifications in psychiatry: A conceptual history |year=1999 |last1=Berrios |first1=German E. |journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=145\u201360 |pmid=10336212|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/511b8d615b7fff9e9fbbb1d29106157af2f8122b }}</ref> Common hybrid views argue that the concept of mental disorder is objective even if only a \"fuzzy [[prototype]]\" that can never be precisely defined, or conversely that the concept always involves a mixture of scientific facts and subjective value judgments.<ref>Perring, C. (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-illness/ Mental Illness] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> Although the diagnostic categories are referred to as 'disorders', they are presented as medical diseases, but are not validated in the same way as most medical diagnoses. Some neurologists argue that classification will only be reliable and valid when based on neurobiological features rather than clinical interview, while others suggest that the differing ideological and practical perspectives need to be better integrated.<ref name=Katsching>{{cite journal |pmid=20148149 |year=2010 |last1=Katschnig |first1=Heinz |title=Are psychiatrists an endangered species?

Studying comorbidity between disorders have demonstrated two latent (unobserved) factors or dimensions in the structure of mental disorders that are thought to possibly reflect etiological processes.  These two dimensions reflect a distinction between internalizing disorders, such as mood or anxiety symptoms, and externalizing disorders such as behavioral or substance abuse symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hankin|first1=BL|last2=Snyder|first2=HR|last3=Gulley|first3=LD|last4=Schweizer|first4=TH|last5=Bijttebier|first5=P|last6=Nelis|first6=S|last7=Toh|first7=G|last8=Vasey|first8=MW|title=Understanding comorbidity among internalizing problems: Integrating latent structural models of psychopathology and risk mechanisms.|journal=Development and Psychopathology|date=November 2016|volume=28|issue=4pt1|pages=987\u20131012|doi=10.1017/S0954579416000663|pmid=27739389|pmc=5119897}}</ref>  A single general factor of psychopathology, similar to the [[G factor (psychometrics)|g factor]] for intelligence, has been empirically supported.

Mood disorder involving unusually intense and sustained sadness, melancholia, or despair is known as [[major depression]] (also known as unipolar or clinical depression). Milder but still prolonged [[Depression (mood)|depression]] can be diagnosed as [[dysthymia]]. [[Bipolar disorder]] (also known as manic depression) involves abnormally \"high\" or pressured mood states, known as [[mania]] or [[hypomania]], alternating with normal or depressed moods. The extent to which unipolar and bipolar mood phenomena represent distinct categories of disorder, or mix and merge along a dimension or spectrum of mood, is subject to some scientific debate.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.035 |title=The DSM-IV and ICD-10 categories of recurrent \\major depressive and bipolar II disorders: Evidence that they lie on a dimensional spectrum |year=2006 |last1=Akiskal |first1=Hagop S. |last2=Benazzi |first2=Franco |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=92 |pages=45\u201354 |pmid=16488021 |issue=1}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=October 2015}}\n\n====Psychotic disorder====\n[[Psychotic disorder]]: Patterns of belief, language use and perception of reality can become dysregulated (e.g., [[delusions]], [[thought disorder]], [[hallucinations]]). Psychotic disorders in this domain include [[schizophrenia]], and [[delusional disorder]]. [[Schizoaffective disorder]] is a category used for individuals showing aspects of both schizophrenia and affective disorders. [[Schizotypy]] is a category used for individuals showing some of the characteristics associated with schizophrenia but without meeting cutoff criteria.\n\n====Personality disorder====\n[[Personality disorder]]: [[Personality development|Personality]]\u2014the fundamental characteristics of a person that influence thoughts and behaviors across situations and time\u2014may be considered disordered if judged to be abnormally rigid and [[maladaptive]]. Although treated separately by some, the commonly used categorical schemes include them as mental disorders, albeit on a separate \"[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#Multi axial system|axis&nbsp;II]]\" in the case of the DSM-IV. A number of different personality disorders are listed, including those sometimes classed as \"eccentric\", such as [[paranoid personality disorder|paranoid]], [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] and [[schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] personality disorders; types that have described as \"dramatic\" or \"emotional\", such as [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] or [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] personality disorders; and those sometimes classed as fear-related, such as [[avoidant personality disorder|anxious-avoidant]], [[dependent personality disorder|dependent]], or [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder|obsessive-compulsive]] personality disorders. The personality disorders, in general, are defined as emerging in childhood, or at least by adolescence or early adulthood. The ICD also has a category for enduring personality change after a catastrophic experience or psychiatric illness. If an inability to sufficiently adjust to life circumstances begins within three months of a particular event or situation, and ends within six months after the stressor stops or is eliminated, it may instead be classed as an [[adjustment disorder]]. There is an emerging consensus that so-called \"personality disorders\", like personality traits in general, actually incorporate a mixture of acute dysfunctional behaviors that may resolve in short periods, and maladaptive temperamental traits that are more enduring.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190200 |title=Assessment and Diagnosis of Personality Disorder: Perennial Issues and an Emerging Reconceptualization |year=2007 |last1=Clark |first1=Lee Anna |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=58 |pages=227\u201357 |pmid=16903806 |issue=1|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/66ec8c4239f08af9864a3577220e99ac22070a43 }}</ref> Furthermore, there are also non-categorical schemes that rate all individuals via a profile of different dimensions of personality without a symptom-based cutoff from normal personality variation, for example through schemes based on dimensional models.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0033291706009482 |title=Comparison of alternative models for personality disorders |year=2006 |last1=Morey |first1=Leslie C. |last2=Hopwood |first2=Christopher J. |last3=Gunderson |first3=John G. |last4=Skodol |first4=Andrew E. |last5=Shea |first5=M.

A common sleep disorder is [[insomnia]], which is described as difficulty falling and/or staying asleep.\n\n====Sexuality related====\nSexual disorders and [[gender dysphoria]]: These disorders include [[dyspareunia]] and various kinds of [[paraphilia]] (sexual arousal to objects, situations, or individuals that are considered abnormal or harmful to the person or others).\n\n====Other====\n[[Impulse control disorder]]: People who are abnormally unable to resist certain urges or impulses that could be harmful to themselves or others, may be classified as having an impulse control disorder, and disorders such as [[kleptomania]] (stealing) or [[pyromania]] (fire-setting). Various behavioral addictions, such as [[gambling]] addiction, may be classed as a disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder can sometimes involve an inability to resist certain acts but is classed separately as being primarily an anxiety disorder.\n\n[[Substance use disorder]]: This disorder refers to the use of drugs (legal or illegal, including [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]]) that persists despite significant problems or harm related to its use. [[Substance dependence]] and [[substance abuse]] fall under this umbrella category in the DSM. Substance use disorder may be due to a pattern of compulsive and repetitive use of a drug that results in tolerance to its effects and withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped.\n\n[[Dissociative disorder]]: People who suffer severe disturbances of their self-identity, memory and general awareness of themselves and their surroundings may be classified as having these types of disorders, including [[depersonalization disorder]] or [[dissociative identity disorder]] (which was previously referred to as multiple personality disorder or \"split personality\").\n\n[[Cognitive disorder]]: These affect cognitive abilities, including learning and memory. This category includes [[delirium]] and mild and major neurocognitive disorder (previously termed [[dementia]]).\n\n[[Developmental disorder]]: These disorders initially occur in childhood. Some examples include [[autism spectrum]] disorders, [[oppositional defiant disorder]] and [[conduct disorder]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), which may continue into adulthood. Conduct disorder, if continuing into adulthood, may be diagnosed as [[antisocial personality disorder]] (dissocial personality disorder in the ICD). Popularist labels such as [[psychopath]] (or sociopath) do not appear in the DSM or ICD but are linked by some to these diagnoses.\n\nSomatoform disorders may be diagnosed when there are problems that appear to originate in the body that are thought to be manifestations of a mental disorder. This includes [[somatization disorder]] and [[conversion disorder]]. There are also disorders of how a person perceives their body, such as [[body dysmorphic disorder]].

There are several main types. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is widely used and is based on modifying the patterns of thought and behavior associated with a particular disorder. Other psychotherapy include dialectic behavioral therapy (DBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). [[Psychoanalysis]], addressing underlying psychic conflicts and defenses, has been a dominant school of psychotherapy and is still in use. [[Systemic therapy]] or [[family therapy]] is sometimes used, addressing a network of significant others as well as an individual.\n\nSome psychotherapies are based on a [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]] approach. There are a number of specific therapies used for particular disorders, which may be offshoots or hybrids of the above types. Mental health professionals often employ an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic or integrative approach]]. Much may depend on the [[therapeutic relationship]], and there may be problems with [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[confidentiality]] and [[engagement]].\n\n===Medication===\nA major option for many mental disorders is [[psychiatric medication]] and there are several main groups. [[Antidepressants]] are used for the treatment of [[clinical depression]], as well as often for anxiety and a range of other disorders. [[Anxiolytics]] (including [[sedatives]]) are used for anxiety disorders and related problems such as insomnia. [[Mood stabilizers]] are used primarily in bipolar disorder. [[Antipsychotics]] are used for psychotic disorders, notably for [[Schizophrenic reaction|positive symptoms in schizophrenia]], and also increasingly for a range of other disorders. [[Stimulants]] are commonly used, notably for [[ADHD]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications/index.shtml|title=NIMH \u00bb Mental Health Medications|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\nDespite the different conventional names of the drug groups, there may be considerable overlap in the disorders for which they are actually indicated, and there may also be [[off-label use]] of medications. There can be problems with [[adverse effects]] of medication and [[Compliance (medicine)|adherence]] to them, and there is also criticism of [[pharmaceutical marketing]] and professional [[conflicts of interest]]. However, these medications in combination with non-pharmacological methods, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are seen to be most effective in treating mental disorders.\n\n===Other===\n[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) is sometimes used in severe cases when other interventions for severe intractable depression have failed. ECT is usually indicated for treatment resistant depression, severe vegetative symptoms, psychotic depression, intense suicidal ideation, depression during pregnancy, and catonia. [[Psychosurgery]] is considered experimental but is advocated by some [[neurologists]] in certain rare cases.<ref>Mind Disorders Encyclopedia [http://www.minddisorders.com/Ob-Ps/Psychosurgery.html Psychosurgery] [Retrieved on August 5th 2008]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2004.09.002 |title=Psychosurgery: Past, present, and future |year=2005 |last1=Mashour |first1=George A. |last2=Walker |first2=Erin E. |last3=Martuza |first3=Robert L. |journal=Brain Research Reviews |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=409\u201319 |pmid=15914249}}</ref>\n\n[[Counseling]] (professional) and [[co-counseling]] (between peers) may be used. [[Psychoeducation]] programs may provide people with the information to understand and manage their problems.

Numerous different classification schemes and diagnostic terms were developed by different authorities, and the term [[psychiatry]] was coined (1808), though medical superintendents were still known as alienists.\n\n====Twentieth century====\n[[File:A mentally ill patient in a strait-jacket attached to the wa Wellcome V0016643ER.jpg|thumb|A patient in a strait-jacket and barrel contraption, 1908]]\nThe turn of the 20th century saw the development of psychoanalysis, which would later come to the fore, along with [[Kraepelin]]'s classification scheme. Asylum \"inmates\" were increasingly referred to as \"patients\", and asylums renamed as hospitals.\n\n===Europe and the United States===\n[[File:Insulin shock therapy.jpg|thumb|[[Insulin shock therapy|Insulin shock procedure]], 1950s]]\n\nEarly in the 20th century in the United States, a [[mental hygiene]] movement developed, aiming to prevent mental disorders. [[Clinical psychology]] and social work developed as professions. [[World War I]] saw a massive increase of conditions that came to be termed \"[[Combat stress reaction|shell shock]]\".\n\n[[World War II]] saw the development in the U.S. of a new psychiatric manual for categorizing mental disorders, which along with existing systems for collecting census and hospital statistics led to the first [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) also developed a section on mental disorders. The term [[stress (biological)|stress]], having emerged from [[endocrinology]] work in the 1930s, was increasingly applied to mental disorders.\n\n[[Electroconvulsive therapy]], [[insulin shock therapy]], [[lobotomy|lobotomies]] and the \"[[neuroleptic]]\" [[chlorpromazine]] came to be used by mid-century. In the 1960s there were many challenges to the concept of [[mental illness]] itself. These challenges came from psychiatrists like Thomas Szasz who argued that mental illness was a myth used to disguise moral conflicts; from sociologists such as [[Erving Goffman]] who said that mental illness was merely another example of how society labels and controls non-conformists; from behavioral psychologists who challenged psychiatry's fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena; and from gay rights activists who criticised the APA's listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder. A study published in ''Science'' by [[Rosenhan experiment|Rosenhan]] received much publicity and was viewed as an attack on the efficacy of psychiatric diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.academyanalyticarts.org/kirk&kutchins.htm |last1=Kirk |first1=Stuart A. |last2=Kutchins |first2=Herb |date=1994 |title=The Myth of the Reliability of DSM |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=15 |issue=1&2 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307115815/http://www.academyanalyticarts.org/kirk%26kutchins.htm |archivedate=2008-03-07 }}</ref>\n\n[[Deinstitutionalization]] gradually occurred in the West, with isolated psychiatric hospitals being closed down in favor of [[community mental health services]]. A [[Psychiatric survivors movement|consumer/survivor movement]] gained momentum. Other kinds of psychiatric medication gradually came into use, such as \"psychic energizers\" (later [[antidepressants]]) and [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]]. [[Benzodiazepines]] gained widespread use in the 1970s for anxiety and depression, until dependency problems curtailed their popularity.\n\nAdvances in [[neuroscience]], genetics and psychology led to new research agendas. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] and other psychotherapies developed. The DSM and then ICD adopted new criteria-based classifications, and the number of \"official\" diagnoses saw a large expansion. Through the 1990s, new [[SSRI]]-type antidepressants became some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the world, as later did [[antipsychotics]]. Also during the 1990s, a [[recovery approach]] developed.\n\n==Society and culture==\n[[File:Self.svg|right|frameless|upright=0.9]]\nDifferent societies or [[cultures]], even different individuals in a [[subculture]], can disagree as to what constitutes optimal versus pathological biological and psychological functioning. Research has demonstrated that cultures vary in the relative importance placed on, for example, happiness, autonomy, or social relationships for pleasure. Likewise, the fact that a behavior pattern is valued, accepted, encouraged, or even statistically normative in a culture does not necessarily mean that it is conducive to optimal psychological functioning.\n\nPeople in all cultures find some behaviors bizarre or even incomprehensible.

The anti-psychiatry message is that [[psychiatric treatment]]s are ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients, and psychiatry's history involves what may now be seen as dangerous treatments.<ref name=burns111/> [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] was one of these, which was used widely between the 1930s and 1960s. [[Lobotomy]] was another practice that was ultimately seen as too invasive and brutal. [[Diazepam]] and other [[sedatives]] were sometimes over-prescribed, which led to an epidemic of dependence. There was also concern about the large increase in prescribing psychiatric drugs for children. Some charismatic psychiatrists came to personify the movement against psychiatry. The most influential of these was [[R.D. Laing]] who wrote a series of best-selling books, including ''[[The Divided Self]]''. Thomas Szasz wrote ''[[The Myth of Mental Illness]]''.

Applications for someone to be involuntarily admitted usually come from a mental health practitioner, a family member, a close relative, or a guardian.

Over 20 behavioral patterns in captive chimpanzees have been documented as (statistically) abnormal for frequency, severity or oddness\u2014some of which have also been observed in the wild. Captive [[great apes]] show gross behavioral abnormalities such as [[stereotypy]] of movements, [[self-mutilation]], disturbed emotional reactions (mainly fear or aggression) towards companions, lack of species-typical communications, and generalized [[learned helplessness]]. In some cases such behaviors are hypothesized to be equivalent to symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders in humans such as depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. Concepts of antisocial, borderline and schizoid personality disorders have also been applied to non-human great apes.<ref name=\"Brune2006\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.09.002 |title=Psychopathology in great apes: Concepts, treatment options and possible homologies to human psychiatric disorders |year=2006 |last1=Brune |first1=M |last2=Brunecohrs |first2=U |last3=McGrew |first3=W |last4=Preuschoft |first4=S |journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1246\u201359 |pmid=17141312}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0019855 |title=Signs of Mood and Anxiety Disorders in Chimpanzees |year=2011 |editor1-last=Callaerts |editor1-first=Patrick |last1=Ferdowsian |first1=Hope R. |last2=Durham |first2=Debra L. |last3=Kimwele |first3=Charles |last4=Kranendonk |first4=Godelieve |last5=Otali |first5=Emily |last6=Akugizibwe |first6=Timothy |last7=Mulcahy |first7=J.B. |last8=Ajarova |first8=Lilly |last9=Johnson |first9=Cassie Mer\u00e9  |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=e19855 |pmid=21698223 |pmc=3116818 |bibcode=2011PLoSO...619855F }}</ref>\n\nThe risk of [[anthropomorphism]] is often raised with regard to such comparisons, and assessment of non-human animals cannot incorporate evidence from linguistic communication. However, available evidence may range from nonverbal behaviors\u2014including physiological responses and homologous facial displays and acoustic utterances\u2014to neurochemical studies.

Studies have also indicated individual variation in temperament, such as sociability or impulsiveness. Particular causes of problems in captivity have included integration of strangers into existing groups and a lack of individual space, in which context some pathological behaviors have also been seen as coping mechanisms.

In ''How Everyone Became Depressed: The Rise and Fall of the Nervous Breakdown'' (2013), Edward Shorter, a professor of psychiatry and the history of medicine, says:\n{{quote|About half of them are depressed. Or at least that is the diagnosis that they got when they were put on antidepressants. ... They go to work but they are unhappy and uncomfortable; they are somewhat anxious; they are tired; they have various physical pains\u2014and they tend to obsess about the whole business. There is a term for what they have, and it is a good old-fashioned term that has gone out of use. They have nerves or a nervous illness. It is an illness not just of mind or brain, but a disorder of the entire body. ... We have a package here of five symptoms\u2014mild depression, some anxiety, fatigue, somatic pains, and obsessive thinking. ... We have had nervous illness for centuries. When you are too nervous to function ... it is a nervous breakdown. But that term has vanished from medicine, although not from the way we speak. ... The nervous patients of yesteryear are the depressives of today. That is the bad news. ... There is a deeper illness that drives depression and the symptoms of mood. We can call this deeper illness something else, or invent a neologism, but we need to get the discussion off depression and onto this deeper disorder in the brain and body.

Vatz, co-author of explication of views of Thomas Szasz in [[Thomas Szasz]] : \"Primary Values and Major Contentions\"}}\n\n==Classifications==\n{{Main|Classification of mental disorders}}\n\nThere are currently two widely established systems that classify mental disorders:\n* ''[[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders]]'', since 1949 part of the [[International Classification of Diseases]] produced by the WHO,\n*  the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-5) produced by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) since 1952.\n\nBoth of these list categories of disorder and provide standardized criteria for diagnosis. They have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although significant differences remain. Other classification schemes may be used in non-western cultures, for example the ''[[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]]'', and other manuals may be used by those of alternative theoretical persuasions, for example the ''[[Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual]]''. In general, mental disorders are classified separately from [[neurological disorders]], [[learning disabilities]] or [[intellectual disability]].\n\nUnlike the DSM and ICD, some approaches are not based on identifying distinct categories of disorder using [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] symptom profiles intended to separate the abnormal from the normal. There is significant scientific debate about the relative merits of categorical versus such non-categorical (or hybrid) schemes, also known as [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] or dimensional models.

Mood disorder involving unusually intense and sustained sadness, melancholia, or despair is known as [[major depression]] (also known as unipolar or clinical depression). Milder but still prolonged [[Depression (mood)|depression]] can be diagnosed as [[dysthymia]]. [[Bipolar disorder]] (also known as manic depression) involves abnormally \"high\" or pressured mood states, known as [[mania]] or [[hypomania]], alternating with normal or depressed moods. The extent to which unipolar and bipolar mood phenomena represent distinct categories of disorder, or mix and merge along a dimension or spectrum of mood, is subject to some scientific debate.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.035 |title=The DSM-IV and ICD-10 categories of recurrent \\major depressive and bipolar II disorders: Evidence that they lie on a dimensional spectrum |year=2006 |last1=Akiskal |first1=Hagop S. |last2=Benazzi |first2=Franco |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=92 |pages=45\u201354 |pmid=16488021 |issue=1}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=October 2015}}\n\n====Psychotic disorder====\n[[Psychotic disorder]]: Patterns of belief, language use and perception of reality can become dysregulated (e.g., [[delusions]], [[thought disorder]], [[hallucinations]]). Psychotic disorders in this domain include [[schizophrenia]], and [[delusional disorder]]. [[Schizoaffective disorder]] is a category used for individuals showing aspects of both schizophrenia and affective disorders. [[Schizotypy]] is a category used for individuals showing some of the characteristics associated with schizophrenia but without meeting cutoff criteria.\n\n====Personality disorder====\n[[Personality disorder]]: [[Personality development|Personality]]\u2014the fundamental characteristics of a person that influence thoughts and behaviors across situations and time\u2014may be considered disordered if judged to be abnormally rigid and [[maladaptive]]. Although treated separately by some, the commonly used categorical schemes include them as mental disorders, albeit on a separate \"[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#Multi axial system|axis&nbsp;II]]\" in the case of the DSM-IV. A number of different personality disorders are listed, including those sometimes classed as \"eccentric\", such as [[paranoid personality disorder|paranoid]], [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] and [[schizotypal personality disorder|schizotypal]] personality disorders; types that have described as \"dramatic\" or \"emotional\", such as [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] or [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] personality disorders; and those sometimes classed as fear-related, such as [[avoidant personality disorder|anxious-avoidant]], [[dependent personality disorder|dependent]], or [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder|obsessive-compulsive]] personality disorders. The personality disorders, in general, are defined as emerging in childhood, or at least by adolescence or early adulthood. The ICD also has a category for enduring personality change after a catastrophic experience or psychiatric illness. If an inability to sufficiently adjust to life circumstances begins within three months of a particular event or situation, and ends within six months after the stressor stops or is eliminated, it may instead be classed as an [[adjustment disorder]]. There is an emerging consensus that so-called \"personality disorders\", like personality traits in general, actually incorporate a mixture of acute dysfunctional behaviors that may resolve in short periods, and maladaptive temperamental traits that are more enduring.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190200 |title=Assessment and Diagnosis of Personality Disorder: Perennial Issues and an Emerging Reconceptualization |year=2007 |last1=Clark |first1=Lee Anna |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=58 |pages=227\u201357 |pmid=16903806 |issue=1|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/66ec8c4239f08af9864a3577220e99ac22070a43 }}</ref> Furthermore, there are also non-categorical schemes that rate all individuals via a profile of different dimensions of personality without a symptom-based cutoff from normal personality variation, for example through schemes based on dimensional models.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0033291706009482 |title=Comparison of alternative models for personality disorders |year=2006 |last1=Morey |first1=Leslie C. |last2=Hopwood |first2=Christopher J. |last3=Gunderson |first3=John G. |last4=Skodol |first4=Andrew E. |last5=Shea |first5=M.

A common sleep disorder is [[insomnia]], which is described as difficulty falling and/or staying asleep.\n\n====Sexuality related====\nSexual disorders and [[gender dysphoria]]: These disorders include [[dyspareunia]] and various kinds of [[paraphilia]] (sexual arousal to objects, situations, or individuals that are considered abnormal or harmful to the person or others).\n\n====Other====\n[[Impulse control disorder]]: People who are abnormally unable to resist certain urges or impulses that could be harmful to themselves or others, may be classified as having an impulse control disorder, and disorders such as [[kleptomania]] (stealing) or [[pyromania]] (fire-setting). Various behavioral addictions, such as [[gambling]] addiction, may be classed as a disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder can sometimes involve an inability to resist certain acts but is classed separately as being primarily an anxiety disorder.\n\n[[Substance use disorder]]: This disorder refers to the use of drugs (legal or illegal, including [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]]) that persists despite significant problems or harm related to its use. [[Substance dependence]] and [[substance abuse]] fall under this umbrella category in the DSM. Substance use disorder may be due to a pattern of compulsive and repetitive use of a drug that results in tolerance to its effects and withdrawal symptoms when use is reduced or stopped.\n\n[[Dissociative disorder]]: People who suffer severe disturbances of their self-identity, memory and general awareness of themselves and their surroundings may be classified as having these types of disorders, including [[depersonalization disorder]] or [[dissociative identity disorder]] (which was previously referred to as multiple personality disorder or \"split personality\").\n\n[[Cognitive disorder]]: These affect cognitive abilities, including learning and memory. This category includes [[delirium]] and mild and major neurocognitive disorder (previously termed [[dementia]]).\n\n[[Developmental disorder]]: These disorders initially occur in childhood. Some examples include [[autism spectrum]] disorders, [[oppositional defiant disorder]] and [[conduct disorder]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), which may continue into adulthood. Conduct disorder, if continuing into adulthood, may be diagnosed as [[antisocial personality disorder]] (dissocial personality disorder in the ICD). Popularist labels such as [[psychopath]] (or sociopath) do not appear in the DSM or ICD but are linked by some to these diagnoses.\n\nSomatoform disorders may be diagnosed when there are problems that appear to originate in the body that are thought to be manifestations of a mental disorder. This includes [[somatization disorder]] and [[conversion disorder]]. There are also disorders of how a person perceives their body, such as [[body dysmorphic disorder]]. [[Neurasthenia]] is an old diagnosis involving somatic complaints as well as fatigue and low spirits/depression, which is officially recognized by the ICD-10 but no longer by the DSM-IV.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00406-006-0699-6 |title=The spectra of neurasthenia and depression: Course, stability and transitions |year=2006 |last1=Gamma |first1=Alex |last2=Angst |first2=Jules |last3=Ajdacic |first3=Vladeta |last4=Eich |first4=Dominique |last5=R\u00f6ssler |first5=Wulf |journal=European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience |volume=257 |issue=2 |pages=120\u201327 |pmid=17131216|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/321668/files/406_2006_Article_699.pdf }}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=October 2015}}\n\n[[Factitious disorder]]s, such as [[Munchausen syndrome]], are diagnosed where symptoms are thought to be experienced (deliberately produced) and/or reported (feigned) for personal gain.\n\nThere are attempts to introduce a category of [[relational disorder]], where the diagnosis is of a relationship rather than on any one individual in that relationship. The relationship may be between children and their parents, between couples, or others. There already exists, under the category of psychosis, a diagnosis of [[shared psychotic disorder]] where two or more individuals share a particular delusion because of their close relationship with each other.\n\nThere are a number of uncommon psychiatric [[syndromes]], which are often named after the person who first described them, such as [[Capgras syndrome]], [[De&nbsp;Clerambault syndrome]], [[Othello syndrome]], [[Ganser syndrome]], [[Cotard delusion]], and [[Delusional parasitosis|Ekbom syndrome]], and additional disorders such as the [[Couvade syndrome]] and [[Geschwind syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.73.2.211-c |title=Uncommon psychiatric syndromes, 4th edn |year=2002 |last1=Trimble |first1=Michael |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=211\u2013c |pmc=1738003}}</ref>\n\nVarious new types of mental disorder diagnosis are occasionally proposed.

Long-term international studies of schizophrenia have found that over a half of individuals recover in terms of symptoms, and around a fifth to a third in terms of symptoms and functioning, with many requiring no medication.

The degree of ability or disability may vary over time and across different life domains. Furthermore, continued disability has been linked to [[institutionalization]], [[mentalism (discrimination)|discrimination]] and [[social exclusion]] as well as to the inherent effects of disorders. Alternatively, functioning may be affected by the stress of having to hide a condition in work or school etc., by adverse effects of medications or other substances, or by mismatches between illness-related variations and demands for regularity.<ref>Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation [http://www.bu.edu/cpr/reasaccom/whatis-psych.html What is Psychiatric Disability and Mental Illness?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104041024/http://www.bu.edu/cpr/reasaccom/whatis-psych.html |date=2012-01-04 }} Boston University, Retrieved January 2012</ref>\n\nIt is also the case that, while often being characterized in purely negative terms, some mental traits or states labeled as disorders can also involve above-average creativity, non-conformity, goal-striving, meticulousness, or empathy.<ref name=\"Rogers&Pilgram05\">{{cite book |author1=Pilgrim, David |author2=Rogers, Anne |title=A sociology of mental health and illness |publisher=Open University Press |location=Milton Keynes |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-335-21583-6 |edition= 3rd}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref> In addition, the public perception of the level of disability associated with mental disorders can change.<ref>Ferney, V.

Unipolar (also known as Major) depressive disorder is the third leading cause of disability worldwide, of any condition mental or physical, accounting for 65.5 million years lost. The first systematic description of global disability arising in youth, in 2011, found that among 10- to 24-year-olds nearly half of all disability (current and as estimated to continue) was due to mental and neurological conditions, including substance use disorders and conditions involving [[self-harm]]. Second to this were accidental injuries (mainly traffic collisions) accounting for 12 percent of disability, followed by communicable diseases at 10 percent. The disorders associated with most disability in high income countries were unipolar major depression (20%) and alcohol use disorder (11%). In the eastern Mediterranean region it was unipolar major depression (12%) and schizophrenia (7%), and in Africa it was unipolar major depression (7%) and bipolar disorder (5%).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60512-6 |title=Global burden of disease in young people aged 10\u201324 years: A systematic analysis |year=2011 |last1=Gore |first1=Fiona M |last2=Bloem |first2=Paul JN |last3=Patton |first3=George C |last4=Ferguson |first4=Jane |last5=Joseph |first5=V\u00e9ronique |last6=Coffey |first6=Carolyn |last7=Sawyer |first7=Susan M |last8=Mathers |first8=Colin D |journal=The Lancet |volume=377 |issue=9783 |pages=2093\u2013102 |pmid=21652063}}</ref>\n\n[[Suicide]], which is often attributed to some underlying mental disorder, is a leading cause of death among teenagers and adults under 35.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1071203.html |title=CIS: UN Body Takes On Rising Suicide Rates \u2013 Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty 2006}}</ref><ref name= understanding_suicidal_behaviour_a02>{{Cite book |last1=O'Connor |first1=Rory |last2=Sheehy |first2=Noel |title=Understanding suicidal behaviour |url=https://books.google.com/?id=79hEYGdDA3oC |date=29 Jan 2000 |publisher=BPS Books |location=Leicester |isbn=978-1-85433-290-5 |pages=33\u201337}}</ref>  There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16946849 |year=2002 |last1=Bertolote |first1=Jos\u00e9 Manoel |last2=Fleischmann |first2=Alexandra |title=Suicide and psychiatric diagnosis: A worldwide perspective |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=181\u201385 |pmc=1489848 |journal=World Psychiatry}}</ref>\n\n==Risk factors==\n{{Main|Causes of mental disorders}}\n\nThe predominant view as of 2018 is that genetic, psychological, and environmental factors all contribute to the development or progression of mental disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arango |first1=Celso |last2=D\u00edaz-Caneja |first2=Covadonga M |last3=McGorry |first3=Patrick D |last4=Rapoport |first4=Judith |last5=Sommer |first5=Iris E |last6=Vorstman |first6=Jacob A |last7=McDaid |first7=David |last8=Mar\u00edn |first8=Oscar |last9=Serrano-Drozdowskyj |first9=Elena |last10=Freedman |first10=Robert |last11=Carpenter |first11=William |title=Preventive strategies for mental health |journal=The Lancet Psychiatry |date=May 2018 |volume=0 |issue=7 |pages=591\u2013604 |doi=10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30057-9 |pmid=29773478 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(18)30057-9/fulltext |language=English |issn=2215-0366}}</ref> Different risk factors may be present at different ages, with risk occurring as early as during prenatal period.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mental_health/mhgap/risks_to_mental_health_EN_27_08_12.pdf|title=Risks To Mental Health: An Overview Of Vulnerabilities And Risk Factors|date=2012|website=WHO.int }}</ref>\n\n===Genetics===\n{{Main|Psychiatric genetics}}\n<!--Please add content here only about clinical genetics - this is not for research about potential biomarkers -->\nA number of psychiatric disorders are linked to a family history (including depression, narcissistic personality disorder<ref name=\"Torgersen\">{{cite journal|last1=Torgersen|first1=S|last2=Lygren|first2=S|last3=Oien|first3=PA|last4=Skre|first4=I|last5=Onstad|first5=S|last6=Edvardsen|first6=J|last7=Tambs|first7=K|last8=Kringlen|first8=E|date=December 2000|title=A twin study of personality disorders|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|volume=41|issue=6|pages=416\u201325|doi=10.1053/comp.2000.16560|pmid=11086146}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Reichborn-Kjennerud|first1=Ted|date=1 March 2010|title=The genetic epidemiology of personality disorders|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=1|pages=103\u201314|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3181941|pmid=20373672}}</ref> and anxiety).<ref name=\"Bienvenu Ginsburg 2007\">{{cite journal|last1=Bienvenu|first1=O.

There are several main types. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is widely used and is based on modifying the patterns of thought and behavior associated with a particular disorder. Other psychotherapy include dialectic behavioral therapy (DBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). [[Psychoanalysis]], addressing underlying psychic conflicts and defenses, has been a dominant school of psychotherapy and is still in use. [[Systemic therapy]] or [[family therapy]] is sometimes used, addressing a network of significant others as well as an individual.\n\nSome psychotherapies are based on a [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]] approach. There are a number of specific therapies used for particular disorders, which may be offshoots or hybrids of the above types. Mental health professionals often employ an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic or integrative approach]]. Much may depend on the [[therapeutic relationship]], and there may be problems with [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[confidentiality]] and [[engagement]].\n\n===Medication===\nA major option for many mental disorders is [[psychiatric medication]] and there are several main groups. [[Antidepressants]] are used for the treatment of [[clinical depression]], as well as often for anxiety and a range of other disorders. [[Anxiolytics]] (including [[sedatives]]) are used for anxiety disorders and related problems such as insomnia. [[Mood stabilizers]] are used primarily in bipolar disorder. [[Antipsychotics]] are used for psychotic disorders, notably for [[Schizophrenic reaction|positive symptoms in schizophrenia]], and also increasingly for a range of other disorders. [[Stimulants]] are commonly used, notably for [[ADHD]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications/index.shtml|title=NIMH \u00bb Mental Health Medications|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\nDespite the different conventional names of the drug groups, there may be considerable overlap in the disorders for which they are actually indicated, and there may also be [[off-label use]] of medications. There can be problems with [[adverse effects]] of medication and [[Compliance (medicine)|adherence]] to them, and there is also criticism of [[pharmaceutical marketing]] and professional [[conflicts of interest]].

Asylum care was often harsh and treated people like wild animals, but towards the end of the 18th century a [[moral treatment]] movement gradually developed. Clear descriptions of some syndromes may be rare prior to the 19th century.\n\n====Nineteenth century====\n[[Industrialization]] and population growth led to a massive expansion of the number and size of insane asylums in every Western country in the 19th century. Numerous different classification schemes and diagnostic terms were developed by different authorities, and the term [[psychiatry]] was coined (1808), though medical superintendents were still known as alienists.\n\n====Twentieth century====\n[[File:A mentally ill patient in a strait-jacket attached to the wa Wellcome V0016643ER.jpg|thumb|A patient in a strait-jacket and barrel contraption, 1908]]\nThe turn of the 20th century saw the development of psychoanalysis, which would later come to the fore, along with [[Kraepelin]]'s classification scheme. Asylum \"inmates\" were increasingly referred to as \"patients\", and asylums renamed as hospitals.\n\n===Europe and the United States===\n[[File:Insulin shock therapy.jpg|thumb|[[Insulin shock therapy|Insulin shock procedure]], 1950s]]\n\nEarly in the 20th century in the United States, a [[mental hygiene]] movement developed, aiming to prevent mental disorders. [[Clinical psychology]] and social work developed as professions. [[World War I]] saw a massive increase of conditions that came to be termed \"[[Combat stress reaction|shell shock]]\".\n\n[[World War II]] saw the development in the U.S. of a new psychiatric manual for categorizing mental disorders, which along with existing systems for collecting census and hospital statistics led to the first [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) also developed a section on mental disorders. The term [[stress (biological)|stress]], having emerged from [[endocrinology]] work in the 1930s, was increasingly applied to mental disorders.\n\n[[Electroconvulsive therapy]], [[insulin shock therapy]], [[lobotomy|lobotomies]] and the \"[[neuroleptic]]\" [[chlorpromazine]] came to be used by mid-century. In the 1960s there were many challenges to the concept of [[mental illness]] itself. These challenges came from psychiatrists like Thomas Szasz who argued that mental illness was a myth used to disguise moral conflicts; from sociologists such as [[Erving Goffman]] who said that mental illness was merely another example of how society labels and controls non-conformists; from behavioral psychologists who challenged psychiatry's fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena; and from gay rights activists who criticised the APA's listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder. A study published in ''Science'' by [[Rosenhan experiment|Rosenhan]] received much publicity and was viewed as an attack on the efficacy of psychiatric diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.academyanalyticarts.org/kirk&kutchins.htm |last1=Kirk |first1=Stuart A. |last2=Kutchins |first2=Herb |date=1994 |title=The Myth of the Reliability of DSM |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=15 |issue=1&2 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307115815/http://www.academyanalyticarts.org/kirk%26kutchins.htm |archivedate=2008-03-07 }}</ref>\n\n[[Deinstitutionalization]] gradually occurred in the West, with isolated psychiatric hospitals being closed down in favor of [[community mental health services]]. A [[Psychiatric survivors movement|consumer/survivor movement]] gained momentum. Other kinds of psychiatric medication gradually came into use, such as \"psychic energizers\" (later [[antidepressants]]) and [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]]. [[Benzodiazepines]] gained widespread use in the 1970s for anxiety and depression, until dependency problems curtailed their popularity.\n\nAdvances in [[neuroscience]], genetics and psychology led to new research agendas. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] and other psychotherapies developed. The DSM and then ICD adopted new criteria-based classifications, and the number of \"official\" diagnoses saw a large expansion. Through the 1990s, new [[SSRI]]-type antidepressants became some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the world, as later did [[antipsychotics]]. Also during the 1990s, a [[recovery approach]] developed.\n\n==Society and culture==\n[[File:Self.svg|right|frameless|upright=0.9]]\nDifferent societies or [[cultures]], even different individuals in a [[subculture]], can disagree as to what constitutes optimal versus pathological biological and psychological functioning. Research has demonstrated that cultures vary in the relative importance placed on, for example, happiness, autonomy, or social relationships for pleasure. Likewise, the fact that a behavior pattern is valued, accepted, encouraged, or even statistically normative in a culture does not necessarily mean that it is conducive to optimal psychological functioning.\n\nPeople in all cultures find some behaviors bizarre or even incomprehensible. But just what they feel is bizarre or incomprehensible is ambiguous and subjective.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1021164602485 |pmid=12517037 |year=2002 |last1=Heinimaa |first1=Markus |journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=291\u201395 |title=Incomprehensibility: The role of the concept in DSM-IV definition of schizophrenic delusions}}</ref> These differences in determination can become highly contentious.

The anti-psychiatry message is that [[psychiatric treatment]]s are ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients, and psychiatry's history involves what may now be seen as dangerous treatments.<ref name=burns111/> [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] was one of these, which was used widely between the 1930s and 1960s. [[Lobotomy]] was another practice that was ultimately seen as too invasive and brutal. [[Diazepam]] and other [[sedatives]] were sometimes over-prescribed, which led to an epidemic of dependence. There was also concern about the large increase in prescribing psychiatric drugs for children. Some charismatic psychiatrists came to personify the movement against psychiatry. The most influential of these was [[R.D. Laing]] who wrote a series of best-selling books, including ''[[The Divided Self]]''. Thomas Szasz wrote ''[[The Myth of Mental Illness]]''. Some ex-patient groups have become militantly anti-psychiatric, often referring to themselves as \"[[Psychiatric survivors movement|survivors]]\".<ref name=burns111>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFf5jD8-J10C|title=Psychiatry:A Very Short Introduction |author=Tom Burns |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-157939-4}}</ref> [[Giorgio Antonucci]] has questioned the basis of psychiatry through his work on the dismantling of two psychiatric hospitals (in the city of [[Imola]]), carried out from 1973 to 1996.\n\nThe [[consumer/survivor movement]] (also known as user/survivor movement) is made up of individuals (and organizations representing them) who are clients of mental health services or who consider themselves survivors of psychiatric interventions.

The two most often utilized grounds for involuntary admission are said to be serious likelihood of immediate or imminent danger to self or others, and the need for treatment. Applications for someone to be involuntarily admitted usually come from a mental health practitioner, a family member, a close relative, or a guardian. Human-rights-oriented laws usually stipulate that independent medical practitioners or other accredited mental health practitioners must examine the patient separately and that there should be regular, time-bound review by an independent review body.<ref name=\"WHORIGHTS\"/> The individual should also have personal access to independent [[advocacy]].\n\nIn order for [[involuntary treatment]] to be administered (by force if necessary), it should be shown that an individual lacks the mental capacity for [[informed consent]] (i.e. to understand treatment information and its implications, and therefore be able to make an informed choice to either accept or refuse). Legal challenges in some areas have resulted in [[supreme court]] decisions that a person does ''not'' have to agree with a psychiatrist's characterization of the issues as constituting an \"illness\", nor agree with a psychiatrist's conviction in medication, but only recognize the issues and the information about treatment options.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid=17696026 |date=June 2007 |last1=Sklar |first1=Ronald |title=Starson v.

Over 20 behavioral patterns in captive chimpanzees have been documented as (statistically) abnormal for frequency, severity or oddness\u2014some of which have also been observed in the wild. Captive [[great apes]] show gross behavioral abnormalities such as [[stereotypy]] of movements, [[self-mutilation]], disturbed emotional reactions (mainly fear or aggression) towards companions, lack of species-typical communications, and generalized [[learned helplessness]]. In some cases such behaviors are hypothesized to be equivalent to symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders in humans such as depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. Concepts of antisocial, borderline and schizoid personality disorders have also been applied to non-human great apes.<ref name=\"Brune2006\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.09.002 |title=Psychopathology in great apes: Concepts, treatment options and possible homologies to human psychiatric disorders |year=2006 |last1=Brune |first1=M |last2=Brunecohrs |first2=U |last3=McGrew |first3=W |last4=Preuschoft |first4=S |journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1246\u201359 |pmid=17141312}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0019855 |title=Signs of Mood and Anxiety Disorders in Chimpanzees |year=2011 |editor1-last=Callaerts |editor1-first=Patrick |last1=Ferdowsian |first1=Hope R. |last2=Durham |first2=Debra L. |last3=Kimwele |first3=Charles |last4=Kranendonk |first4=Godelieve |last5=Otali |first5=Emily |last6=Akugizibwe |first6=Timothy |last7=Mulcahy |first7=J.B. |last8=Ajarova |first8=Lilly |last9=Johnson |first9=Cassie Mer\u00e9  |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=e19855 |pmid=21698223 |pmc=3116818 |bibcode=2011PLoSO...619855F }}</ref>\n\nThe risk of [[anthropomorphism]] is often raised with regard to such comparisons, and assessment of non-human animals cannot incorporate evidence from linguistic communication. However, available evidence may range from nonverbal behaviors\u2014including physiological responses and homologous facial displays and acoustic utterances\u2014to neurochemical studies. It is pointed out that human psychiatric classification is often based on statistical description and judgment of behaviors (especially when speech or language is impaired) and that the use of verbal self-report is itself problematic and unreliable.<ref name=\"Brune2006\"/><ref name=\"Fabrega2006\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.09.004 |title=Making sense of behavioral irregularities of great apes |year=2006 |last1=Fabregajr |first1=H |journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1260\u201373; discussion 1274\u201377 |pmid=17079015}}</ref>\n\nPsychopathology has generally been traced, at least in captivity, to adverse rearing conditions such as early separation of infants from mothers; early sensory deprivation; and extended periods of social isolation. Studies have also indicated individual variation in temperament, such as sociability or impulsiveness. Particular causes of problems in captivity have included integration of strangers into existing groups and a lack of individual space, in which context some pathological behaviors have also been seen as coping mechanisms. Remedial interventions have included careful individually tailored re-socialization programs, [[behavior therapy]], environment enrichment, and on rare occasions psychiatric drugs.
