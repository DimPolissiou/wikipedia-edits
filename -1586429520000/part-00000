He was the first physician to serve on CardioNet's Medical Advisory Board in 1999, the first dedicated wireless medicine company that performs real-time ECG remote, continuous rhythm monitoring. In 2007 he joined the Board of Sotera Wireless that has developed the first continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring device, which also captures all vital signs. In 2008 he forged a new educational program with [[Qualcomm]] and [[Scripps Health]] to train physicians in wireless medicine, a 2-year clinician scholar program: STSI Wireless Health Scholar. At the 2009 International Wireless [[CTIA - The Wireless Association|CTIA]] meeting, he gave the keynote address on wireless health, the first time this topic has ever been the subject of a CTIA plenary session: CTIA 2009 Keynote.  Also in 2009, he served as Co-Founder with Gary and Mary West to form the [[West Wireless Health Institute]]. He is the Vice-Chairman of the Institute and its Chief Innovation Officer. He presented at TEDMED the rapid progress being made in this field: TEDMED 2009 Lecture. In addition, in early 2010 Topol gave a wireless medicine presentation at the [[Consumer Electronic Show]]: CES 2010 Keynote Highlight. He led the first trial with the GE Vscan device GE Reports, a pocket high resolution, mobile ultrasound imaging device, introduced in the US in 2010 \"The Doctor Will \u201ce\u201d You Now\" and is currently leading clinical trials of heart rhythm and heart failure monitoring wireless devices.\n\n==NHS==\nHe was commissioned by [[Jeremy Hunt]] in 2018 to carry out a review of how the [[NHS]] workforce, will need to change \u201cto deliver a digital future\u201d.  His report suggested that within ten years most patients would be managing their own long-term conditions with wearable devices and sensors, and that that would be much more effective than occasional appointments with a doctor.  Patients would not be monitored in hospital but at home. This rise in regular monitoring would necessitate new workflows and frameworks in [[Digital Healthcare|digital healthcare]].<ref name=\"topol.hee.nhs.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://topol.hee.nhs.uk/|title=The Topol Review \u2014 NHS Health Education England|website=The Topol Review \u2014 NHS Health Education England|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> More nursing and physician associates would be required, enabling doctors to focus on the most difficult cases.<ref>{{cite news |title=Could patients become their own doctors? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47205496 |accessdate=14 February 2019 |publisher=BBC |date=12 February 2019}}</ref>  The report also recommended specific digital training for NHS staff and physicians.<ref name=\"topol.hee.nhs.uk\"/> His work on \"High-performance medicine\" that builds on this report was also published in ''Nature.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30617339-high-performance-medicine-the-convergence-of-human-and-artificial-intelligence/?dopt=Abstract|title=High-performance Medicine: The Convergence of Human and Artificial Intelligence|last=Ej|first=Topol|date=January 2019|website=Nature medicine|language=en|pmid=30617339|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\n== Vioxx ==\nTopol served as chairman of cardiovascular medicine at [[Cleveland Clinic]] (1991-2005).

He was the first physician to serve on CardioNet's Medical Advisory Board in 1999, the first dedicated wireless medicine company that performs real-time ECG remote, continuous rhythm monitoring. In 2007 he joined the Board of Sotera Wireless that has developed the first continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring device, which also captures all vital signs. In 2008 he forged a new educational program with [[Qualcomm]] and [[Scripps Health]] to train physicians in wireless medicine, a 2-year clinician scholar program: STSI Wireless Health Scholar. At the 2009 International Wireless [[CTIA - The Wireless Association|CTIA]] meeting, he gave the keynote address on wireless health, the first time this topic has ever been the subject of a CTIA plenary session: CTIA 2009 Keynote.  Also in 2009, he served as Co-Founder with Gary and Mary West to form the [[West Wireless Health Institute]]. He is the Vice-Chairman of the Institute and its Chief Innovation Officer. He presented at TEDMED the rapid progress being made in this field: TEDMED 2009 Lecture. In addition, in early 2010 Topol gave a wireless medicine presentation at the [[Consumer Electronic Show]]: CES 2010 Keynote Highlight. He led the first trial with the GE Vscan device GE Reports, a pocket high resolution, mobile ultrasound imaging device, introduced in the US in 2010 \"The Doctor Will \u201ce\u201d You Now\" and is currently leading clinical trials of heart rhythm and heart failure monitoring wireless devices.\n\n==NHS==\nHe was commissioned by [[Jeremy Hunt]] in 2018 to carry out a review of how the [[NHS]] workforce, will need to change \u201cto deliver a digital future\u201d.  His report suggested that within ten years most patients would be managing their own long-term conditions with wearable devices and sensors, and that that would be much more effective than occasional appointments with a doctor.  Patients would not be monitored in hospital but at home. This rise in regular monitoring would necessitate new workflows and frameworks in [[Digital Healthcare|digital healthcare]].<ref name=\"topol.hee.nhs.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://topol.hee.nhs.uk/|title=The Topol Review \u2014 NHS Health Education England|website=The Topol Review \u2014 NHS Health Education England|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> More nursing and physician associates would be required, enabling doctors to focus on the most difficult cases.<ref>{{cite news |title=Could patients become their own doctors? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47205496 |accessdate=14 February 2019 |publisher=BBC |date=12 February 2019}}</ref>  The report also recommended specific digital training for NHS staff and physicians.<ref name=\"topol.hee.nhs.uk\"/> His work on \"High-performance medicine\" that builds on this report was also published in ''Nature.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30617339-high-performance-medicine-the-convergence-of-human-and-artificial-intelligence/?dopt=Abstract|title=High-performance Medicine: The Convergence of Human and Artificial Intelligence|last=Ej|first=Topol|date=January 2019|website=Nature medicine|language=en|pmid=30617339|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\n== Vioxx ==\nTopol served as chairman of cardiovascular medicine at [[Cleveland Clinic]] (1991-2005).

However, the first sentence of the Acts follows the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles in distinguishing the apostle Thomas and the apostle Judas son of James. Others, such as James Tabor, identify him as Judah, the brother of Jesus mentioned by Mark.

In addition, the next Sunday of the Easter (Pascha) is celebrated as the Sunday of Thomas, in commemoration of Thomas' question to Jesus, which led him to proclaim, according to Orthodox teaching, two natures of Jesus, both human and divine.

However, the skull of Thomas is said to be at [[Monastery of Saint John the Theologian]] on the Greek island of [[Patmos]].{{sfn|Sanidopoulos|2010}}\n\nOrtona's three galleys reached the island of [[Chios]] in 1258, led by General Leone Acciaiuoli. Chios was considered the island where Saint Thomas, after his death in India, had been buried. A portion fought around the Peloponnese and the Aegean islands, the other in the sea lapping at the then Syrian coast. The three galleys of Ortona moved on the second front of the war and reached the island of Chios.\n\nThe tale is provided by Giambattista De Lectis, physician and writer of the 16th century of Ortona. After the looting, the navarca Ortona Leone went to pray in the main church of the island of Chios and was drawn to a chapel adorned and resplendent with lights. An elderly priest, through an interpreter informed him that in that oratory was venerated the Body of Saint Thomas the Apostle. Lion, filled with an unusual sweetness, gathered in deep prayer. At that moment a light hand twice invited him to come closer. The navarca Leone reached out and took a bone from the largest hole of the tombstone, on which were carved the Greek letters and a halo depicted a bishop from the waist up. He was the confirmation of what he had said the old priest and that you are indeed in the presence of the Apostle's body. He went back on the galley and planned the theft for the next night, along with fellow Ruggiero Grogno. They lifted the heavy gravestone and watched the underlying relics. The wrapped in snow-white cloths them laid in a wooden box (stored at Ortona to the looting of 1566) and brought them aboard the galley. Lion, then, along with other comrades, he returned again in the church, took the tombstone and took her away. Just the Chinardo admiral was aware of the precious cargo moved all the sailors of the Muslim faith on other ships and ordered him to take the route to Ortona.\n\n[[File:Ortona -San Tommaso - Portal- 2006 by-RaBoe 01.jpg|thumb|left|Portal of Ortona, St Thomas' Basilica]]\nHe landed at the port of Ortona 6 September 1258. According to the story of De Lectis, he was informed the abbot Jacopo responsible for Ortona Church, which predispose full provision for hospitality felt and shared by all the people. Since then the body of the apostle and the gravestone are preserved in the crypt of the Basilica. In 1259 a parchment written in Bari by the court under John Peacock contracts, the presence of five witnesses, preserved in Ortona at the Diocesan Library, confirming the veracity of that event, reported, as mentioned, by Giambattista De Lectis, physician and writer Ortona of the 16th century.\n\nThe relics resisted both the Saracen looting of 1566, and the destruction of the Nazis in the [[battle of Ortona]] fought in late December 1943. The basilica was blown up because the belfry was considered a lookout point by the allies, coming by sea from San Vito Chietino. The relics, together with the treasure of Saint Thomas, were intended by the Germans to be sold, but the monks entombed them inside the bell tower, the only surviving part of the semi-ruined church.\n[[File:Ortona -San Tommaso- 2006 by-RaBoe 03.jpg|thumb|Original Chios' tombstone of Thomas, brought in the crypt of Ortona's Basilica]]\n\nThe tombstone of Thomas, brought to Ortona from Chios along with the relics of the Apostle, is currently preserved in the crypt of St Thomas Basilica, behind the altar. The urn containing the bones instead is placed under the altar. It is the cover of a fake coffin, fairly widespread burial form in the early Christian world, as the top of a tomb of less expensive material. The plaque has an inscription and a bas-relief that refer, in many respects, to the Syro-Mesopotamian. Tombstone Thomas the Apostle on inclusion can be read, in Greek characters uncial, the expression 'osios thomas, that Saint Thomas. It can be dated from the point of view palaeographic and lexical to the 3rd\u20135th century, a time when the term osios is still used as a synonym of aghios in that holy is he that is in the grace of God and is inserted in the Church: the two vocabulary, therefore, indicate the Christians. In the particular case of Saint Thomas' plaque, then, the word osios can easily be the translation of the word Syriac ''mar'' (Lord), attributed in the ancient world, but also to the present day, is a saint to be a bishop.\n\n====Iraq====\nThe finger bones of Saint Thomas were discovered during restoration work at the [[Church of Saint Thomas, Mosul|Church of Saint Thomas]] in [[Mosul]], [[Iraq]] in 1964,<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=|script-title=ar:\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0634\u064a\u0641: \u0627\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0641 \u0630\u062e\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u062a\u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u064a\u062f \u0645\u0637\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0635\u0644 \u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u0648\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0648\u0633 \u0632\u0643\u0627 \u0639\u064a\u0648\u0627\u0635|url=http://www.syrian-orthodox.com/readnews.php?id=530|work=Syrian Orthodox Patriarchate|access-date=18 May 2018|language=ar}}</ref> and were housed there until the [[Fall of Mosul]], after which the relics were transferred to the [[Mar Mattai monastery|Monastery of Saint Matthew]] on 17 June 2014.{{sfn|Arraf|2018}}<ref name=\"theorthodoxchurch.info\" />\n\n== Historical references ==\n[[File:By the command of an Indian King he was thrust through with Lances.jpg|thumb|By the command of an Indian King he was thrust through with Lances]]\nA number of early Christian writings written during the centuries immediately following the first Ecumenical Council of 325 mention Thomas' mission.\n\nThe ''Transitus Mariae'' describes each of the apostles purportedly being temporarily transported to heaven during the [[Assumption of Mary]].\n\n=== Acts of Thomas ===\nThe main source is the [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] [[Acts of Thomas]], sometimes called by its full name ''The Acts of Judas Thomas'', written circa 180\u2013230 AD/CE,<ref name=\"Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles\" /><ref name=\"constom\" /> These are generally regarded by various Christian religions as [[apocryphal]], or even heretical.

In that part of India where they first rested, stand a monastery and a church of striking dimensions, elaborately adorned and designed. This Theodore, who had been to the place, narrated to us.\"{{sfn|Medlycott|1905|p=71}}\n\n== Writings ==\n<!---maybe \"Bibliography\" would be better--->\n{{quote|Let none read the gospel according to Thomas, for it is the work, not of one of the twelve apostles, but of one of [[Mani (prophet)|Mani's]] three wicked disciples.|[[Cyril of Jerusalem]], ''Cathechesis'' V (4th century)}}\n\nIn the first two centuries of the Christian era, a number of writings were circulated. It is unclear now why Thomas was seen as an authority for doctrine, although this belief is documented in Gnostic groups as early as the ''[[Pistis Sophia]]''. In that Gnostic work, [[Mary Magdalene]] (one of the disciples) says:\n\n{{quote|Now at this time, my Lord, hear, so that I speak openly, for thou hast said to us \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear:\" Concerning the word which thou didst say to Philip: \"Thou and Thomas and Matthew are the three to whom it has been given\u2026 to write every word of the Kingdom of the Light, and to bear witness to them\"; hear now that I give the interpretation of these words. It is this which thy light-power once prophesied through Moses: \"Through two and three witnesses everything will be established. The three witnesses are Philip and Thomas and Matthew\"|''Pistis Sophia'' 1:43}}\n\nAn early, non-Gnostic tradition may lie behind this statement, which also emphasizes the primacy of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in its [[Aramaic]] form, over the other canonical three.\n\nBesides the ''[[Acts of Thomas]]'' there was a widely circulated ''[[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]]'' probably written in the later 2nd century, and probably also in [[Syria]], which relates the miraculous events and prodigies of Jesus' boyhood. This is the document which tells for the first time the familiar legend of the twelve sparrows which Jesus, at the age of five, fashioned from clay on the Sabbath day, which took wing and flew away. The earliest manuscript of this work is a 6th-century one in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. This gospel was first referred to by [[Irenaeus]]; Ron Cameron notes: \"In his citation, Irenaeus first quotes a non-canonical story that circulated about the childhood of Jesus and then goes directly on to quote a passage from the infancy narrative of the [[Gospel of Luke]].{{Bibleref2c|Luke|2:49|KJV}} Since the Infancy Gospel of Thomas records both of these stories, in relative close proximity to one another, it is possible that the [[apocryphal]] writing cited by Irenaeus is, in fact, what is now known as the Infancy Gospel of Thomas. Because of the complexities of the manuscript tradition, however, there is no certainty as to when the stories of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas began to be written down.\"\n\nThe best known in modern times of these documents is the \"sayings\" document that is being called the [[Gospel of Thomas]], a noncanonical work whose date is disputed. The opening line claims it is the work of \"Didymos Judas Thomas\" \u2013 whose identity is unknown. This work was discovered in a [[Coptic language|Coptic]] translation in 1945 at the Egyptian village of [[Nag Hammadi]], near the site of the monastery of Chenoboskion. Once the Coptic text was published, scholars recognized that an earlier Greek translation had been published from fragments of [[papyrus]] found at [[Oxyrhynchus]] in the 1890s.\n\n== Saint Thomas Cross ==\n[[File:Nasrani cross.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint Thomas Christian cross]]\nIn the 16th-century work ''Jornada'', Antonio Gouvea writes of ornate crosses known as ''Saint Thomas Crosses''. It is also known as Nasrani Menorah,{{sfn|Collins|2007|p=119}} Persian Cross, or Mar Thoma Sleeva.{{sfn|Antony|2019}} These crosses are believed to date from the 6th century as per the tradition and are found in a number of churches in Kerala, Mylapore and Goa. ''Jornada'' is the oldest known written document to refer to this type of cross as a St. Thomas Cross. Gouvea also writes about the veneration of the Cross at Cranganore, referring to the cross as \"Cross of Christians\".\n\nThere are several interpretations of the Nasrani symbol. The interpretation based on Christian Jewish tradition assumes that its design was based on Jewish [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], an ancient symbol of the Hebrews, which consists of seven branched lamp stand (candelabra).{{sfn|Collins|2007|p=119}} The interpretation based on local culture states that the Cross without the figure of Jesus and with flowery arms symbolizing \"joyfulness\" points to the resurrection theology of Saint Paul; the Holy Spirit on the top represents the role of Holy Spirit in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The lotus symbolizing Buddhism and the Cross over it shows that Christianity was established in the land of Buddha. The three steps indicate Calvary and the rivulets, channels of Grace flowing from the Cross.{{sfn|Thadikkatt|2004|p=114}}\n\n==In Islam==\nThe [[Qur\u2019an]]ic account of the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] does not include their names, numbers, or any detailed accounts of their lives.

Otherwise, other editors may have to revert and await your explanation -->\nThomas first speaks in the [[Gospel of John]]. In {{bibleref|John |11:16|KJV}}, when [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] had recently died, the apostles do not wish to go back to [[Judea]], where some Jews had attempted to stone Jesus. Thomas says: \"Let us also go, that we may die with him.\"{{efn|All three occasions are discussed in detail by Dr.&nbsp;Mathew Vallanickal, \"Faith and Character of Apostle Thomas\" in ''The St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India'', Vol.&nbsp;II, Trichur, 1973, p.&nbsp;2}}\n\nThomas speaks again in {{bibleref2|John |14:5|KJV}}. There, [[Jesus]] had just explained that he was going away to prepare a heavenly home for his followers, and that one day they would join him there. Thomas reacted by saying, \"Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?\"\n\n{{bibleref2|John |20:24\u201329|KJV}} tells how [[doubting Thomas]] was skeptical at first when he heard that Jesus had risen from the dead and appeared to the other apostles, saying, \"Except I shall see on his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.\"{{bibleref2c-nb|John |20:25|KJV}} But when Jesus appeared later and invited Thomas to touch his wounds and behold him, Thomas showed his belief by saying, \"My Lord and my God\".{{bibleref2c-nb|John |20:28|KJV}} Jesus then said, \"Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed ''[are]'' they that have not seen, and ''[yet]'' have believed.\"{{bibleref2c-nb|John |20:29|KJV}}\n\n== Names and etymologies ==\n<!-- please insert reason WHY you are making change on edit summary. Otherwise, other editors may have to revert and await your explanation -->\nThe name ''Thomas'' ([[Koine Greek]]: \u0398\u03c9\u03bc\u1fb6\u03c2) given for the apostle in the New Testament is derived from the [[Aramaic]] \u05ea\u05d5\u05bc\u05de\u05b8\u05d0 or {{lang-syc|\u072c\u0710\u0718\u0721\u0710}} ''Taum\u0101''/''Toma'', equivalently from [[Hebrew]] \u05ea\u05b5\u05d0\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd ''Teom'', meaning \"twin\". The equivalent term for twin in Greek, which is also used in the New Testament, is \u0394\u03af\u03b4\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 ''Didymos''.\n\n=== Other names ===\n<!-- please insert reason WHY you are making change on edit summary. Otherwise, other editors may have to revert and await your explanation -->\nThe [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi]] copy of the ''[[Gospel of Thomas]]'' begins: \"These are the secret sayings that the living Jesus spoke and Didymos, Judas Thomas, recorded.\" Early Syrian traditions also relate the apostle's full name as Judas Thomas.{{efn|\"... Judas Thomas, as he is called [in the ''Acta Thomae''] and elsewhere in Syriac tradition ...\". {{harvnb|Thurston|1913}} }} Some have seen in the ''[[Acts of Thomas]]'' (written in east Syria in the early 3rd century, or perhaps as early as the first half of the 2nd century) an identification of Saint Thomas with the apostle Judas, Son of James, better known in English as [[Saint Jude|Jude]]. However, the first sentence of the Acts follows the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles in distinguishing the apostle Thomas and the apostle Judas son of James. Others, such as James Tabor, identify him as Judah, the brother of Jesus mentioned by Mark. In the [[Book of Thomas the Contender]], part of the [[Nag Hammadi library]], he is alleged to be a twin to Jesus: \"Now, since it has been said that you are my twin and true companion, examine yourself\u2026\"{{sfn |Thomas the Apostle|n.d.}}\n\nA \"Doubting Thomas\" is a skeptic who refuses to believe without direct personal experience\u2014a reference to the Apostle Thomas, due to his refusal to believe the resurrected [[Jesus]] had appeared to the ten other apostles, until he could see and feel the wounds received by Jesus on the cross.\n\n=== Feast days ===\nWhen the feast of Saint Thomas was inserted in the Roman calendar in the 9th century, it was assigned to 21 December. The ''Martyrology of St. Jerome'' mentioned the apostle on 3 July, the date to which the Roman celebration was transferred in 1969, so that it would no longer interfere with the major ferial days of [[Advent]].{{sfn|Catholic Church|1969|p=96}}  Traditionalist Roman Catholics (who follow the [[General Roman Calendar of 1960]] or earlier) and many [[Anglicans]] (including members of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] as well as members of the [[Church of England]] and the [[Lutheran Church]], who worship according to the 1662 edition of the [[Book of Common Prayer]]),<ref name=\"commonprayer.org\" /> still celebrate his feast day on 21 December. However, most modern liturgical calendars (including the [[Common Worship]] calendar of the Church of England) prefer 3 July.\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Byzantine Catholic]] churches celebrate his [[feast day]] on 6 October<ref name=\"ocafs.oca.org1\" /> (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian calendar]], 6 October currently falls on 19 October of the modern [[Gregorian calendar]]).  In addition, the next Sunday of the Easter (Pascha) is celebrated as the Sunday of Thomas, in commemoration of Thomas' question to Jesus, which led him to proclaim, according to Orthodox teaching, two natures of Jesus, both human and divine. Thomas is commemorated in common with all of the other apostles on 30 June (13 July), in a feast called the [[Synaxis]] of the Holy Apostles.<ref name=\"ocafs.oca.org1\" /> He is also associated with the \"Arabian\" (or \"Arapet\") [[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] (Mother of God), which is commemorated on 6 September (19 September).<ref name=\"ocafs.oca.org2\" /> The Malankara Orthodox church celebrates his feast on three days, 3 July<ref name=\"malankaraorthodoxchurch.in\" /> (in memory of the relic translation to Edessa), 18 December (the Day he was lanced),<ref name=\"malankaraorthodoxchurch.in\" /> and 21 December (when he died).<ref name=\"malankaraorthodoxchurch.in\" />\n\n== Later history and traditions ==\n''The Passing of Mary'', adjudged heretical by [[Pope Gelasius I]] in 494, was attributed to [[Joseph of Arimathea]].{{sfn|Lewis|1927|p=}}{{sfn|Robinson|1926|p=33}} The document states that Thomas was the only witness of the [[Assumption of Mary]] into heaven.

However, the skull of Thomas is said to be at [[Monastery of Saint John the Theologian]] on the Greek island of [[Patmos]].{{sfn|Sanidopoulos|2010}}\n\nOrtona's three galleys reached the island of [[Chios]] in 1258, led by General Leone Acciaiuoli. Chios was considered the island where Saint Thomas, after his death in India, had been buried. A portion fought around the Peloponnese and the Aegean islands, the other in the sea lapping at the then Syrian coast. The three galleys of Ortona moved on the second front of the war and reached the island of Chios.\n\nThe tale is provided by Giambattista De Lectis, physician and writer of the 16th century of Ortona. After the looting, the navarca Ortona Leone went to pray in the main church of the island of Chios and was drawn to a chapel adorned and resplendent with lights. An elderly priest, through an interpreter informed him that in that oratory was venerated the Body of Saint Thomas the Apostle. Lion, filled with an unusual sweetness, gathered in deep prayer. At that moment a light hand twice invited him to come closer. The navarca Leone reached out and took a bone from the largest hole of the tombstone, on which were carved the Greek letters and a halo depicted a bishop from the waist up. He was the confirmation of what he had said the old priest and that you are indeed in the presence of the Apostle's body. He went back on the galley and planned the theft for the next night, along with fellow Ruggiero Grogno. They lifted the heavy gravestone and watched the underlying relics. The wrapped in snow-white cloths them laid in a wooden box (stored at Ortona to the looting of 1566) and brought them aboard the galley. Lion, then, along with other comrades, he returned again in the church, took the tombstone and took her away. Just the Chinardo admiral was aware of the precious cargo moved all the sailors of the Muslim faith on other ships and ordered him to take the route to Ortona.\n\n[[File:Ortona -San Tommaso - Portal- 2006 by-RaBoe 01.jpg|thumb|left|Portal of Ortona, St Thomas' Basilica]]\nHe landed at the port of Ortona 6 September 1258. According to the story of De Lectis, he was informed the abbot Jacopo responsible for Ortona Church, which predispose full provision for hospitality felt and shared by all the people. Since then the body of the apostle and the gravestone are preserved in the crypt of the Basilica. In 1259 a parchment written in Bari by the court under John Peacock contracts, the presence of five witnesses, preserved in Ortona at the Diocesan Library, confirming the veracity of that event, reported, as mentioned, by Giambattista De Lectis, physician and writer Ortona of the 16th century.\n\nThe relics resisted both the Saracen looting of 1566, and the destruction of the Nazis in the [[battle of Ortona]] fought in late December 1943. The basilica was blown up because the belfry was considered a lookout point by the allies, coming by sea from San Vito Chietino. The relics, together with the treasure of Saint Thomas, were intended by the Germans to be sold, but the monks entombed them inside the bell tower, the only surviving part of the semi-ruined church.\n[[File:Ortona -San Tommaso- 2006 by-RaBoe 03.jpg|thumb|Original Chios' tombstone of Thomas, brought in the crypt of Ortona's Basilica]]\n\nThe tombstone of Thomas, brought to Ortona from Chios along with the relics of the Apostle, is currently preserved in the crypt of St Thomas Basilica, behind the altar. The urn containing the bones instead is placed under the altar. It is the cover of a fake coffin, fairly widespread burial form in the early Christian world, as the top of a tomb of less expensive material. The plaque has an inscription and a bas-relief that refer, in many respects, to the Syro-Mesopotamian. Tombstone Thomas the Apostle on inclusion can be read, in Greek characters uncial, the expression 'osios thomas, that Saint Thomas. It can be dated from the point of view palaeographic and lexical to the 3rd\u20135th century, a time when the term osios is still used as a synonym of aghios in that holy is he that is in the grace of God and is inserted in the Church: the two vocabulary, therefore, indicate the Christians. In the particular case of Saint Thomas' plaque, then, the word osios can easily be the translation of the word Syriac ''mar'' (Lord), attributed in the ancient world, but also to the present day, is a saint to be a bishop.\n\n====Iraq====\nThe finger bones of Saint Thomas were discovered during restoration work at the [[Church of Saint Thomas, Mosul|Church of Saint Thomas]] in [[Mosul]], [[Iraq]] in 1964,<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=|script-title=ar:\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0634\u064a\u0641: \u0627\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0641 \u0630\u062e\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u062a\u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u064a\u062f \u0645\u0637\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0635\u0644 \u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u0648\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0648\u0633 \u0632\u0643\u0627 \u0639\u064a\u0648\u0627\u0635|url=http://www.syrian-orthodox.com/readnews.php?id=530|work=Syrian Orthodox Patriarchate|access-date=18 May 2018|language=ar}}</ref> and were housed there until the [[Fall of Mosul]], after which the relics were transferred to the [[Mar Mattai monastery|Monastery of Saint Matthew]] on 17 June 2014.{{sfn|Arraf|2018}}<ref name=\"theorthodoxchurch.info\" />\n\n== Historical references ==\n[[File:By the command of an Indian King he was thrust through with Lances.jpg|thumb|By the command of an Indian King he was thrust through with Lances]]\nA number of early Christian writings written during the centuries immediately following the first Ecumenical Council of 325 mention Thomas' mission.\n\nThe ''Transitus Mariae'' describes each of the apostles purportedly being temporarily transported to heaven during the [[Assumption of Mary]].\n\n=== Acts of Thomas ===\nThe main source is the [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] [[Acts of Thomas]], sometimes called by its full name ''The Acts of Judas Thomas'', written circa 180\u2013230 AD/CE,<ref name=\"Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles\" /><ref name=\"constom\" /> These are generally regarded by various Christian religions as [[apocryphal]], or even heretical.

His holy remains (corpus), after a long interval of time, were removed to the city of Edessa in Syria and there interred. In that part of India where they first rested, stand a monastery and a church of striking dimensions, elaborately adorned and designed. This Theodore, who had been to the place, narrated to us.\"{{sfn|Medlycott|1905|p=71}}\n\n== Writings ==\n<!---maybe \"Bibliography\" would be better--->\n{{quote|Let none read the gospel according to Thomas, for it is the work, not of one of the twelve apostles, but of one of [[Mani (prophet)|Mani's]] three wicked disciples.|[[Cyril of Jerusalem]], ''Cathechesis'' V (4th century)}}\n\nIn the first two centuries of the Christian era, a number of writings were circulated. It is unclear now why Thomas was seen as an authority for doctrine, although this belief is documented in Gnostic groups as early as the ''[[Pistis Sophia]]''. In that Gnostic work, [[Mary Magdalene]] (one of the disciples) says:\n\n{{quote|Now at this time, my Lord, hear, so that I speak openly, for thou hast said to us \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear:\" Concerning the word which thou didst say to Philip: \"Thou and Thomas and Matthew are the three to whom it has been given\u2026 to write every word of the Kingdom of the Light, and to bear witness to them\"; hear now that I give the interpretation of these words. It is this which thy light-power once prophesied through Moses: \"Through two and three witnesses everything will be established. The three witnesses are Philip and Thomas and Matthew\"|''Pistis Sophia'' 1:43}}\n\nAn early, non-Gnostic tradition may lie behind this statement, which also emphasizes the primacy of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in its [[Aramaic]] form, over the other canonical three.\n\nBesides the ''[[Acts of Thomas]]'' there was a widely circulated ''[[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]]'' probably written in the later 2nd century, and probably also in [[Syria]], which relates the miraculous events and prodigies of Jesus' boyhood. This is the document which tells for the first time the familiar legend of the twelve sparrows which Jesus, at the age of five, fashioned from clay on the Sabbath day, which took wing and flew away. The earliest manuscript of this work is a 6th-century one in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. This gospel was first referred to by [[Irenaeus]]; Ron Cameron notes: \"In his citation, Irenaeus first quotes a non-canonical story that circulated about the childhood of Jesus and then goes directly on to quote a passage from the infancy narrative of the [[Gospel of Luke]].{{Bibleref2c|Luke|2:49|KJV}} Since the Infancy Gospel of Thomas records both of these stories, in relative close proximity to one another, it is possible that the [[apocryphal]] writing cited by Irenaeus is, in fact, what is now known as the Infancy Gospel of Thomas. Because of the complexities of the manuscript tradition, however, there is no certainty as to when the stories of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas began to be written down.\"\n\nThe best known in modern times of these documents is the \"sayings\" document that is being called the [[Gospel of Thomas]], a noncanonical work whose date is disputed. The opening line claims it is the work of \"Didymos Judas Thomas\" \u2013 whose identity is unknown. This work was discovered in a [[Coptic language|Coptic]] translation in 1945 at the Egyptian village of [[Nag Hammadi]], near the site of the monastery of Chenoboskion. Once the Coptic text was published, scholars recognized that an earlier Greek translation had been published from fragments of [[papyrus]] found at [[Oxyrhynchus]] in the 1890s.\n\n== Saint Thomas Cross ==\n[[File:Nasrani cross.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint Thomas Christian cross]]\nIn the 16th-century work ''Jornada'', Antonio Gouvea writes of ornate crosses known as ''Saint Thomas Crosses''. It is also known as Nasrani Menorah,{{sfn|Collins|2007|p=119}} Persian Cross, or Mar Thoma Sleeva.{{sfn|Antony|2019}} These crosses are believed to date from the 6th century as per the tradition and are found in a number of churches in Kerala, Mylapore and Goa. ''Jornada'' is the oldest known written document to refer to this type of cross as a St. Thomas Cross. Gouvea also writes about the veneration of the Cross at Cranganore, referring to the cross as \"Cross of Christians\".\n\nThere are several interpretations of the Nasrani symbol. The interpretation based on Christian Jewish tradition assumes that its design was based on Jewish [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], an ancient symbol of the Hebrews, which consists of seven branched lamp stand (candelabra).{{sfn|Collins|2007|p=119}} The interpretation based on local culture states that the Cross without the figure of Jesus and with flowery arms symbolizing \"joyfulness\" points to the resurrection theology of Saint Paul; the Holy Spirit on the top represents the role of Holy Spirit in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The lotus symbolizing Buddhism and the Cross over it shows that Christianity was established in the land of Buddha. The three steps indicate Calvary and the rivulets, channels of Grace flowing from the Cross.{{sfn|Thadikkatt|2004|p=114}}\n\n==In Islam==\nThe [[Qur\u2019an]]ic account of the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] does not include their names, numbers, or any detailed accounts of their lives. Muslim [[exegesis]], however, more-or-less agrees with the [[New Testament]] list and says that the disciples included [[Peter in Islam|Peter]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], Thomas, [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]], [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[Jude the Apostle|Jude]], [[John the Apostle|John]], and [[Simon the Zealot]].{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2002|p=86}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books|Apostle (Christian)}}\n* [[Book of Thomas the Contender]]\n* [[Syro Malabar Catholic Church]]\n* [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]]\n* [[Gospel of Barnabas]]\n* [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East]]\n* [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]]\n* [[Saint Thomas of Mylapur]]\n* [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]]\n* [[St. Thomas' Church (disambiguation)|St. Thomas' Church]] for a listing of all churches and chapel named in his honour\n* [[Throne of St. Thomas]]\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist\n|refs =\n\n<ref name=\"latin mass soc\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lms.org.uk/find-a-mass/liturgical-calendar-2012#Dec |title=Liturgical Calendar: December' |website = Latin-mass-society.org |access-date=2010-04-25 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120205023737/http://www.lms.org.uk/find-a-mass/liturgical-calendar-2012#Dec |archive-date=5 February 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"commonprayer.org\">{{cite web |url = http://www.commonprayer.org/calend/propers/s_thom.cfm |title=Propers for St. Thomas the Apostle |publisher=Commonprayer.org |date= |access-date=2010-04-25 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ccel\">{{cite web |url = http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-08/anf08-111.htm#P8673_2825546 |title=The Passing of Mary |website = Ccel.org |date=2005-06-01 |access-date=2010-04-25 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles\">{{harvnb|Wright|1871|p=}}; Rev.

{"title_page": "Glossary of invasion biology terms", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia glossary}}\n{{Globalize|article|Western culture|date=May 2016}}\n\n{{Expand German|Hemerochorie|date=May 2016}} \n\nThe need for a clearly defined and consistent '''invasion biology terminology''' has been acknowledged by many sources. ''[[Invasive species]]'', or ''invasive [[Introduced species|exotics]]'', is a nomenclature term and categorization phrase used for flora and fauna, and for specific restoration-preservation processes in native [[habitat]]s. ''Invasion biology'' is the study of these organisms and the processes of species invasion. \n\nThe terminology in this page contains definitions for invasion biology terms in common usage today, taken from accessible publications.  References for each definition are included.  Terminology relates primarily to invasion biology terms with some [[ecology]] terms included to clarify language and phrases on linked pages.\n\n==Introduction==\nDefinitions of \"invasive non-indigenous species have been inconsistent\", which has led to confusion both in literature and in popular publications (Williams and Meffe 2005).  Also, many scientists and managers feel that there is no firm definition of non-indigenous species, native species, exotic species, \"and so on, and ecologists do not use the terms consistently.\" (Shrader-Frechette 2001)  Another question asked is whether current language is likely to promote \"effective and appropriate action\" towards invasive species through cohesive language (Larson 2005).  Biologists today spend more time and effort on invasive species work because of the rapid spread, economic cost, and effects on ecological systems, so the importance of effective communication about invasive species is clear. (Larson 2005)\n\nControversy in invasion biology terms exists because of past usage and because of preferences for certain terms.  Even for biologists, defining a [[species]] as native may be far from being a straightforward matter of biological classification based on the location or the discipline a biologist is working in (Helmreich 2005).  Questions often arise as to what exactly makes a species native as opposed to non-native, because some non-native species have no known negative effects (Woods and Moriarty 2001).  Natural biological invasions, generally considered range expansions, and introductions involving human activities are important and could be considered a normal ecological process (Vermeij 2005).  Non-native and native species may be sometimes considered invasive, and these invasions often follow human-induced landscape changes, with subsequent damage to existing landscapes a value judgment (Foster and Sandberg 2004).  As a result, many important terms relevant to invasion biology, such as invasive, weed, or transient, include qualities that are \"open to subjective interpretation\" (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  Sometimes one species can have both beneficial and detrimental effects, such as the [[Mosquito fish]] (''Gambusia affinis''), which has been widely introduced because of its suppression of larval [[mosquito]]es, although it also has negative impacts on native species of insects, fish and amphibians (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).\n\nThe large number and current complexity of terms makes interpretation of some of the invasion biology literature challenging and intimidating.  Exotic, alien, transplanted, introduced, non-indigenous, and invasive are all words that have been used to describe plants and animals that have been moved beyond their native ranges by humans (Williams and Meffe 2005), along with other terms such as foreign, injurious, aquatic nuisance, pest, non-native, all with a particular implication.  Even the use of what seem to be simple, basic terms to articulate ecological concepts \"can confuse ideological debates and undermine management efforts\" (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  Attempts to redefine commonly used terms in invasion biology have been difficult because many authors and biologists are particular to a favorite definition (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  Also, the status and identification of any species as an invader, a weed, or an exotic are \"conditioned by cultural and political circumstances.\" (Robbins 2004)\n\n==Terminology==\nWhere words in a sentence are also defined elsewhere in this article, they appear in italics.\n\n:;Alien species (See [[Introduced species]]): Less commonly used in scientific literature but often included in ''population'' publications, public information displays, and educational literature. This term refers to ''species'' that spread beyond their ''native range'', not necessarily harmful, or ''species'' introduced to a new range that establish themselves and spread; similar terms include ''exotic species'', ''foreign species'', ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species'' (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).\n\n:;[[Aquatic nuisance species]]: Less commonly used in most literature. 1. A ''nonindigenous species'' that threatens the diversity or abundance of native species or the [[ecological stability]] of infested waters, or commercial, agricultural, aquacultural or recreational activities dependent on such waters (EPA 1990). 2. Aquatic ''species'' that causes economic or environmental harm to humans (Heutte and Bella 2003). 3. An aquatic ''species'' with adverse effects on humans, either directly (e.g. ''species'' that produce toxins that are harmful to humans) or indirectly (e.g. ''species'' that infest nature reserves) (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). \n\n:;Biological control or biocontrol (See [[Biological pest control]]): 1. In general, the control of the numbers of one organism as a result of natural predation by another or others. Specifically, the human use of natural predators for the control of ''pests'' or ''weeds''. Also applied to the introduction of large numbers of sterilized males of the ''pest species'', whose matings result in the laying of infertile eggs (Allaby 1998). 2. The release of one ''species'' to control another (Carlton 2001). 3. The management of ''weeds'' using introduced herbivores (often insects) as biological control agents (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;[[Biological invasion]] or [[bioinvasion]]: A broad term for both human-assisted introductions and natural range expansions (Carlton 2001).\n\n:;Biological diversity (See [[biodiversity]]): Used to describe ''species'' richness, ecosystem complexity, and genetic variation (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;Biological control (See [[Biological pest control]]): Control method involving a biological control agent that is a natural enemy of a target ''pest'' (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;Bioregion (See [[Ecoregion]]): A biological subdivision of the earth\u2019s surface delineated by the ''flora'' and ''fauna'' of the region (Allaby 1998).\n\n:;[[Biota (ecology)|Biota]]: The organisms (plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, algae, etc.) of a specific region or period, or the total aggregation of organisms in the biosphere (Allaby 1998).\n \n:;[[Casual species]]: This term is becoming less common in usage. A ''non native species'' that does not form self-replacing ''populations'' (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). Similar terms include ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species''.\n\n:;[[Herbicide|Chemical control]]: Control method that employs herbicides to control ''exotic'' plants (Heutte and Bella 2003). \n\n:;Community: Any grouping of ''populations'' of different organisms that live together in a particular environment (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;[[Cryptogenic species]]: ''Species'' that are neither clearly ''native'' nor ''exotic'' (Cohen and Carlton 1988).\n\n:;[[Cultivar]]: A variety of a plant produced and maintained by horticultural techniques and not normally found in wild ''populations'' (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;[[Disturbance (ecology)|Disturbance]]: An event or change in the environment that alters the composition and successional status of a biological community and may deflect succession onto a new trajectory, such as a forest fire or hurricane, glaciation, agriculture, and urbanization (Art 1993). \n\n:;[[Ecosystem]]: A discrete unit, or community of organisms and their physical environment (living and non-living parts), that interact to form a stable system (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;[[Endemism|Endemic]]: A ''species'' or taxonomic group that is restricted to a particular geographic region because of such factors as isolation or response to soil or climatic conditions; this ''species'' is said to be endemic to the region (Allaby 1998).\n\n:;Exotic species (See [[Introduced species]]): This term is commonly used in publications and literature, and is similar to the terms ''alien species'', ''foreign species'', ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species'' (Heutte and Bella 2003). Other definitions include: 1. An ''introduced'', ''non native species'', or a ''species'' that is the result of direct or indirect, deliberate or accidental introduction of the ''species'' by humans, and for which introduction permitted the species to cross a natural barrier to dispersal (Noss and Cooperrider 1994). 2. In North America, often refers to those ''species'' not present in a ''bioregion'' before the entry of Europeans in the 16th century, or present in later parts of that region and later introduced to an ecosystem by human-mediated mechanisms (Cohen and Carlton 1988). \n\n:;[[Fauna]]: The animal life of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;Foreign species (See [[Introduced species]]): A species introduced to a new area or country. Similar terms include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species''. \n\n:;[[Flora]]: Plant or bacterial life forms of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;[[Habitat]]: The place, including physical and biotic conditions, where a plant or an animal usually occurs (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;[[Herbicide]]: ''Pesticide'' that specifically targets vegetation (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Hybrid (biology)|Hybridization]]: Production of novel genotypes, through mating between distinct species or ecotypes. Novel genotypes may be more invasive than parental genotypes.\n\n:;Indigenous (See [[Indigenous species]]): A ''species'' that occurs naturally in an area; a synonym for ''native species'' (Allaby 1998).\n\n:;[[Injurious species]]: An ''introduced species'' that causes economic or environmental harm to humans. Similar terms include ''aquatic nuisance species'', ''noxious weed'', and ''invasive species'' (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Intentional introduction]]: A ''species'' that is brought to a new area, country, or bioregion for a specific purpose, such as for a garden or lawn; a crop species; a landscaping ''species''; a ''species'' that provides food; a groundcover ''species''; for soil stabilization or hydrological control; for aesthetics or familiarity of the ''species''; or other purposeful reasons (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;[[Introduced species]]: This term, along with the terms ''introduced species'' and ''nonindigenous species'', is one of the most commonly used terms to describe a plant or animal species that is not originally from the area in which it occurs. This terms means those ''species'' that have been transported by human activities, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a region in which they did not occur in historical time and are now reproducing in the wild (Carlton 2001). Similar terms include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', ''foreign species'', ''non indigenous specie''s, and ''non native species''.\n\n:;[[Ecological_facilitation#Invasibility|Invasibility]]: The ease with which a ''habitat'' is invaded (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;Invasion (See [[Introduced species]] and [[Invasive species]]): The expansion of a ''species'' into an area not previously occupied by it (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;[[Invasive species]]: Generally, this term refers to a subset of plants or animals that are introduced to an area, survive, and reproduce, and expand beyond the original area of introduction. This is the biological definition. Practical definitions add that they cause harm economically or environmentally within the new area of introduction. 1. An ''alien species'' whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health (Executive Order 1999). 2. An adjective for ''non native'' or ''nonindigenous species'' that have colonized natural areas; 3. Discrimination of ''nonindigenous species'' established in cultivated ''habitats'' (as \u2018noninvasive\u2019) from those established in natural ''habitats''; 4. ''Nonindigenous species'' that are widespread; or 5. Widespread ''nonindigenous species'' that have adverse effects on the invaded ''habitat'' (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). Other definitions include the following: 5. ''Species'' that spread beyond their ''native range'', not necessarily harmful, or ''species'' introduced to a new range that establish themselves and spread (Jeschke and Strayer 2005). 6. ''Species'' that displace ''native species'' and have the ability to dominate an ecosystem, or a species that enters an ecosystem beyond its natural range and causes economic or environmental harm (Heutte and Bella 2003). \n\n:;[[Integrated Pest Management]]: IPM focuses on long-term prevention or suppression of ''pests''. The integrated approach to ''weed'' management incorporates the best suited cultural, biological and chemical controls that have minimum impact on the environment and on people (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Manual control]]: Removal that involves the use of tools such as shovels, axes, rakes, grubbing hoes, and hand clippers to expose, cut, and remove flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, and/or roots from target plants (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Mechanical control]]: Removal that involves the use of motorized equipment such as mowers, \u201cweed-whackers\u201d, and tractor-mounted plows, disks, and sweepers. Burning is also categorized here (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Native range]]: The ecosystem that a ''species'' inhabits (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;Native species (See [[Indigenous (ecology)]]): 1. A synonym for ''indigenous species'' 2. A ''species'' that occurs naturally in an area, and has not been introduced by humans either intentionally or unintentionally (Allaby 2005). 3. In North America, a ''species'' established before the year 500 (Jeschke and Strayer 2005)\n\n:;[[Native weed]] ([[invasive native]]): A ''species'' that is native to an area or ''bioregion'' that has increased in number dramatically. In cases of ''disturbance'' or change to a landscape, a ''ruderal species'' can increase in cover and compete with other native plants, threatening the diversity of a community. In other cases, landscape level changes can cause the increase of the ''population'' of a ''species'', such as white-tailed deer in the northeastern part of the United State, which are at the highest levels historically and cause damage to humans, crops, and structures, suffer high disease levels, and pose threats to humans through interactions on roads (Foster and Sandberg 2004).\n\n:;Naturalized species (See [[Introduced species]]): 1. A ''species'' that was originally introduced from a different country, a different ''bioregion'', or a different geographical area, but now behaves like a native species in that it maintains itself without further human intervention and now grows and reproduces in native communities (Allaby 1998). 2. A ''non native species'' that forms self-sustaining ''populations'' but is not necessarily an ''invasive species'' (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;Neobiota: An umbrella term for the entirety of all non-native species, independently of their taxonomic rank, naturalization status or time of introduction, without defining these by a negation (non-native) or by an evaluative approach (Kowarik 2002.  \n\n:;[[Niche opportunity]]: Defines conditions that promote invasions in terms of resources, natural enemies, the physical environment, interactions between these factors, and the manner in which they vary in time and space (Shea and Chesson 2002).\n\n:;[[Nonindigenous species]]: This is a common term used along with ''non native species'' and ''introduced species'' in current literature and publications; other similar terms include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', and ''foreign species''. 1. Any ''species'' or other viable biological material that enters an ecosystem beyond its historic range, including any such organism transferred from one country into another (EPA 1990). 2. A plant or animal that is not native to the area in which it occurs which was either intentionally or unintentionally introduced (Williams and Meffe 2005). \n\n:;[[Non native species]]: This term, along with the terms ''introduced species'' and ''nonindigenous species'', is one of the most commonly used terms to describe a plant or animal ''species'' that is not originally from the area in which it occurs. Similar terms also include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', and ''foreign species''. This term has also been defined as: 1. A ''species'' whose presence is due to ''intentional'' or ''unintentional introduction'' as a result of human activity (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). 2. A ''species'' that has been introduced to an area or ''bioregion'' (Heutte and Bella 2003). \n\n:;[[Noxious weed]]: This term is frequently a legal term in state code, denoting a special status of the plant as, for example, ''prohibited'' or ''restricted''. 1. Native or non-native plants, or plant products, that injure or cause damage to interests of agriculture, irrigation, navigation, natural resources, public health, or the environment (Heutte and Bella 2003). 2. Implies a ''species''\u2019 adverse effects on humans, either directly (e.g. ''species'' that produce toxins that are harmful to humans) or indirectly (e.g. species that infest nature reserves) (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). 3. Any ''species'' of plants, either annual, biennial, or perennial; reproduced by seed, root, underground stem, or bulblet; which when established is or may become destructive and difficult to control by ordinary means of cultivation or other farm practices (Heutte and Bella 2003). \n\n:;Pathway (See Path): 1. Used to mean ''vector'', purpose (the reason why a ''species'' is moved), and route (the geographic corridor from one point to another) (Carlton 2001). 2. Mode by which a ''species'' establishes and continues to exist in a new environment (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Pest (organism)|Pest]]: 1. An animal that competes with humans by consuming or damaging food, fiber, or other materials intended for human consumption or use, such as an insect consuming a cropfield (Allaby 1998) 2. Synonymous to ''invasive species'' (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).\n\n:;[[Pesticide]]: A chemical or biological agent intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate plant or animal life and any substance intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant, including insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, herbicides, nematocides, and biocides (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Population]]: A group of potentially inter-breeding individuals of the same ''species'' found in the same place at the same time (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;[[Prohibited weed]]: A specific legal term applied to a plant or plant part that may not be brought into a state (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Restricted weed]]: A specific legal term applied to a plant or plant part that may only be brought into a state in limited quantities (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Ruderal species]]: A plant associated with human dwellings, construction, or agriculture, that usually colonizes disturbed or waste ground. Ruderals are often ''weeds'' which have high demands for nutrients and are intolerant of competition. See also ''native weed or invasive native'' (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;[[Soil seed bank|Seed bank]]: Seeds that become incorporated into the soil (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;[[Species]]: A group of organisms formally recognized as distinct from other groups; the taxon rank in the hierarchy of biological classification below genus; the basic unit of biological classification, defined by the reproductive isolation of the group from all other groups of organisms (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;[[Tens rule]]: 1. Describes how approximately ten percent of ''species'' pass through each transition from being imported to becoming ''casual'' to becoming established, and finally becoming a ''weed'' (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). 2. Ten percent of the ''introduced species'' establish themselves in the non native continent and ten percent of these, in turn, spread or are ''pests'' although many exceptions to this rule have been noted (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).\n\n:;Time lag: 1. Time between introduction, establishment, and spread of a ''species'' (Jeschke and Strayer 2005). 2. The time between when a ''species'' is introduced and when its ''population'' growth explodes (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;[[Unintentional introduction]]: An introduction of ''nonindigenous species'' that occurs as the result of activities other than the purposeful or intentional introduction of the ''species'' involved, such as the transport of ''nonindigenous species'' in ballast or in water used to transport fish, mollusks or crustaceans for aquaculture or other purposes (EPA 1990). \n\n:;Vector (See [[Vector (epidemiology)]]): The physical means or agent by which a ''species'' is transported, such as ballast water, ships\u2019 hulls, boats, hiking boats, cars, vehicles, packing material, or soil in nursery stock (Carlton 2001). See also ''pathway''. \n\n:;[[Weed]]: 1. A plant in the wrong place, being one that occurs opportunistically on land or in water that has been disturbed by human activities (see also ''ruderal species'' and ''native weed or invasive native''), or on cultivated land, where it competes for nutrients, water, sunlight, or other resources with cultivated plants such as food crops. Under different circumstances the weed plant itself may be cultivated for different purposes (Allaby 1998). 2. A ''native'' or ''introduced species'' that has a perceived negative ecological or economic effect on agricultural or natural ecosystems (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). 3. A plant growing in an area where it is not wanted (Royer and Dickinson 1999).\n\n===Legal definitions===\n\n:;[[Invasive species (United States)]]: Executive Order 13112 (1999) defines this term as an ''alien species'' whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health.

''[[Invasive species]]'', or ''invasive [[Introduced species|exotics]]'', is a nomenclature term and categorization phrase used for flora and fauna, and for specific restoration-preservation processes in native [[habitat]]s. ''Invasion biology'' is the study of these organisms and the processes of species invasion. \n\nThe terminology in this page contains definitions for invasion biology terms in common usage today, taken from accessible publications.  References for each definition are included.  Terminology relates primarily to invasion biology terms with some [[ecology]] terms included to clarify language and phrases on linked pages.\n\n==Introduction==\nDefinitions of \"invasive non-indigenous species have been inconsistent\", which has led to confusion both in literature and in popular publications (Williams and Meffe 2005).  Also, many scientists and managers feel that there is no firm definition of non-indigenous species, native species, exotic species, \"and so on, and ecologists do not use the terms consistently.\" (Shrader-Frechette 2001)  Another question asked is whether current language is likely to promote \"effective and appropriate action\" towards invasive species through cohesive language (Larson 2005).  Biologists today spend more time and effort on invasive species work because of the rapid spread, economic cost, and effects on ecological systems, so the importance of effective communication about invasive species is clear. (Larson 2005)\n\nControversy in invasion biology terms exists because of past usage and because of preferences for certain terms.  Even for biologists, defining a [[species]] as native may be far from being a straightforward matter of biological classification based on the location or the discipline a biologist is working in (Helmreich 2005).  Questions often arise as to what exactly makes a species native as opposed to non-native, because some non-native species have no known negative effects (Woods and Moriarty 2001).  Natural biological invasions, generally considered range expansions, and introductions involving human activities are important and could be considered a normal ecological process (Vermeij 2005).  Non-native and native species may be sometimes considered invasive, and these invasions often follow human-induced landscape changes, with subsequent damage to existing landscapes a value judgment (Foster and Sandberg 2004).  As a result, many important terms relevant to invasion biology, such as invasive, weed, or transient, include qualities that are \"open to subjective interpretation\" (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  Sometimes one species can have both beneficial and detrimental effects, such as the [[Mosquito fish]] (''Gambusia affinis''), which has been widely introduced because of its suppression of larval [[mosquito]]es, although it also has negative impacts on native species of insects, fish and amphibians (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).\n\nThe large number and current complexity of terms makes interpretation of some of the invasion biology literature challenging and intimidating.  Exotic, alien, transplanted, introduced, non-indigenous, and invasive are all words that have been used to describe plants and animals that have been moved beyond their native ranges by humans (Williams and Meffe 2005), along with other terms such as foreign, injurious, aquatic nuisance, pest, non-native, all with a particular implication.  Even the use of what seem to be simple, basic terms to articulate ecological concepts \"can confuse ideological debates and undermine management efforts\" (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  Attempts to redefine commonly used terms in invasion biology have been difficult because many authors and biologists are particular to a favorite definition (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  Also, the status and identification of any species as an invader, a weed, or an exotic are \"conditioned by cultural and political circumstances.\" (Robbins 2004)\n\n==Terminology==\nWhere words in a sentence are also defined elsewhere in this article, they appear in italics.\n\n:;Alien species (See [[Introduced species]]): Less commonly used in scientific literature but often included in ''population'' publications, public information displays, and educational literature. This term refers to ''species'' that spread beyond their ''native range'', not necessarily harmful, or ''species'' introduced to a new range that establish themselves and spread; similar terms include ''exotic species'', ''foreign species'', ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species'' (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).\n\n:;[[Aquatic nuisance species]]: Less commonly used in most literature. 1. A ''nonindigenous species'' that threatens the diversity or abundance of native species or the [[ecological stability]] of infested waters, or commercial, agricultural, aquacultural or recreational activities dependent on such waters (EPA 1990). 2. Aquatic ''species'' that causes economic or environmental harm to humans (Heutte and Bella 2003). 3. An aquatic ''species'' with adverse effects on humans, either directly (e.g. ''species'' that produce toxins that are harmful to humans) or indirectly (e.g. ''species'' that infest nature reserves) (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). \n\n:;Biological control or biocontrol (See [[Biological pest control]]): 1. In general, the control of the numbers of one organism as a result of natural predation by another or others. Specifically, the human use of natural predators for the control of ''pests'' or ''weeds''. Also applied to the introduction of large numbers of sterilized males of the ''pest species'', whose matings result in the laying of infertile eggs (Allaby 1998). 2. The release of one ''species'' to control another (Carlton 2001). 3. The management of ''weeds'' using introduced herbivores (often insects) as biological control agents (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;[[Biological invasion]] or [[bioinvasion]]: A broad term for both human-assisted introductions and natural range expansions (Carlton 2001).\n\n:;Biological diversity (See [[biodiversity]]): Used to describe ''species'' richness, ecosystem complexity, and genetic variation (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;Biological control (See [[Biological pest control]]): Control method involving a biological control agent that is a natural enemy of a target ''pest'' (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;Bioregion (See [[Ecoregion]]): A biological subdivision of the earth\u2019s surface delineated by the ''flora'' and ''fauna'' of the region (Allaby 1998).\n\n:;[[Biota (ecology)|Biota]]: The organisms (plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, algae, etc.) of a specific region or period, or the total aggregation of organisms in the biosphere (Allaby 1998).\n \n:;[[Casual species]]: This term is becoming less common in usage. A ''non native species'' that does not form self-replacing ''populations'' (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). Similar terms include ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species''.\n\n:;[[Herbicide|Chemical control]]: Control method that employs herbicides to control ''exotic'' plants (Heutte and Bella 2003). \n\n:;Community: Any grouping of ''populations'' of different organisms that live together in a particular environment (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;[[Cryptogenic species]]: ''Species'' that are neither clearly ''native'' nor ''exotic'' (Cohen and Carlton 1988).\n\n:;[[Cultivar]]: A variety of a plant produced and maintained by horticultural techniques and not normally found in wild ''populations'' (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;[[Disturbance (ecology)|Disturbance]]: An event or change in the environment that alters the composition and successional status of a biological community and may deflect succession onto a new trajectory, such as a forest fire or hurricane, glaciation, agriculture, and urbanization (Art 1993). \n\n:;[[Ecosystem]]: A discrete unit, or community of organisms and their physical environment (living and non-living parts), that interact to form a stable system (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;[[Endemism|Endemic]]: A ''species'' or taxonomic group that is restricted to a particular geographic region because of such factors as isolation or response to soil or climatic conditions; this ''species'' is said to be endemic to the region (Allaby 1998).\n\n:;Exotic species (See [[Introduced species]]): This term is commonly used in publications and literature, and is similar to the terms ''alien species'', ''foreign species'', ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species'' (Heutte and Bella 2003). Other definitions include: 1. An ''introduced'', ''non native species'', or a ''species'' that is the result of direct or indirect, deliberate or accidental introduction of the ''species'' by humans, and for which introduction permitted the species to cross a natural barrier to dispersal (Noss and Cooperrider 1994). 2. In North America, often refers to those ''species'' not present in a ''bioregion'' before the entry of Europeans in the 16th century, or present in later parts of that region and later introduced to an ecosystem by human-mediated mechanisms (Cohen and Carlton 1988). \n\n:;[[Fauna]]: The animal life of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;Foreign species (See [[Introduced species]]): A species introduced to a new area or country. Similar terms include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species''. \n\n:;[[Flora]]: Plant or bacterial life forms of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;[[Habitat]]: The place, including physical and biotic conditions, where a plant or an animal usually occurs (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;[[Herbicide]]: ''Pesticide'' that specifically targets vegetation (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Hybrid (biology)|Hybridization]]: Production of novel genotypes, through mating between distinct species or ecotypes. Novel genotypes may be more invasive than parental genotypes.\n\n:;Indigenous (See [[Indigenous species]]): A ''species'' that occurs naturally in an area; a synonym for ''native species'' (Allaby 1998).\n\n:;[[Injurious species]]: An ''introduced species'' that causes economic or environmental harm to humans. Similar terms include ''aquatic nuisance species'', ''noxious weed'', and ''invasive species'' (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Intentional introduction]]: A ''species'' that is brought to a new area, country, or bioregion for a specific purpose, such as for a garden or lawn; a crop species; a landscaping ''species''; a ''species'' that provides food; a groundcover ''species''; for soil stabilization or hydrological control; for aesthetics or familiarity of the ''species''; or other purposeful reasons (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;[[Introduced species]]: This term, along with the terms ''introduced species'' and ''nonindigenous species'', is one of the most commonly used terms to describe a plant or animal species that is not originally from the area in which it occurs. This terms means those ''species'' that have been transported by human activities, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a region in which they did not occur in historical time and are now reproducing in the wild (Carlton 2001). Similar terms include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', ''foreign species'', ''non indigenous specie''s, and ''non native species''.\n\n:;[[Ecological_facilitation#Invasibility|Invasibility]]: The ease with which a ''habitat'' is invaded (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;Invasion (See [[Introduced species]] and [[Invasive species]]): The expansion of a ''species'' into an area not previously occupied by it (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;[[Invasive species]]: Generally, this term refers to a subset of plants or animals that are introduced to an area, survive, and reproduce, and expand beyond the original area of introduction. This is the biological definition. Practical definitions add that they cause harm economically or environmentally within the new area of introduction. 1. An ''alien species'' whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health (Executive Order 1999). 2. An adjective for ''non native'' or ''nonindigenous species'' that have colonized natural areas; 3. Discrimination of ''nonindigenous species'' established in cultivated ''habitats'' (as \u2018noninvasive\u2019) from those established in natural ''habitats''; 4. ''Nonindigenous species'' that are widespread; or 5. Widespread ''nonindigenous species'' that have adverse effects on the invaded ''habitat'' (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). Other definitions include the following: 5. ''Species'' that spread beyond their ''native range'', not necessarily harmful, or ''species'' introduced to a new range that establish themselves and spread (Jeschke and Strayer 2005). 6. ''Species'' that displace ''native species'' and have the ability to dominate an ecosystem, or a species that enters an ecosystem beyond its natural range and causes economic or environmental harm (Heutte and Bella 2003). \n\n:;[[Integrated Pest Management]]: IPM focuses on long-term prevention or suppression of ''pests''. The integrated approach to ''weed'' management incorporates the best suited cultural, biological and chemical controls that have minimum impact on the environment and on people (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Manual control]]: Removal that involves the use of tools such as shovels, axes, rakes, grubbing hoes, and hand clippers to expose, cut, and remove flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, and/or roots from target plants (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Mechanical control]]: Removal that involves the use of motorized equipment such as mowers, \u201cweed-whackers\u201d, and tractor-mounted plows, disks, and sweepers. Burning is also categorized here (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Native range]]: The ecosystem that a ''species'' inhabits (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;Native species (See [[Indigenous (ecology)]]): 1. A synonym for ''indigenous species'' 2. A ''species'' that occurs naturally in an area, and has not been introduced by humans either intentionally or unintentionally (Allaby 2005). 3. In North America, a ''species'' established before the year 500 (Jeschke and Strayer 2005)\n\n:;[[Native weed]] ([[invasive native]]): A ''species'' that is native to an area or ''bioregion'' that has increased in number dramatically. In cases of ''disturbance'' or change to a landscape, a ''ruderal species'' can increase in cover and compete with other native plants, threatening the diversity of a community. In other cases, landscape level changes can cause the increase of the ''population'' of a ''species'', such as white-tailed deer in the northeastern part of the United State, which are at the highest levels historically and cause damage to humans, crops, and structures, suffer high disease levels, and pose threats to humans through interactions on roads (Foster and Sandberg 2004).\n\n:;Naturalized species (See [[Introduced species]]): 1. A ''species'' that was originally introduced from a different country, a different ''bioregion'', or a different geographical area, but now behaves like a native species in that it maintains itself without further human intervention and now grows and reproduces in native communities (Allaby 1998). 2. A ''non native species'' that forms self-sustaining ''populations'' but is not necessarily an ''invasive species'' (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;Neobiota: An umbrella term for the entirety of all non-native species, independently of their taxonomic rank, naturalization status or time of introduction, without defining these by a negation (non-native) or by an evaluative approach (Kowarik 2002.  \n\n:;[[Niche opportunity]]: Defines conditions that promote invasions in terms of resources, natural enemies, the physical environment, interactions between these factors, and the manner in which they vary in time and space (Shea and Chesson 2002).\n\n:;[[Nonindigenous species]]: This is a common term used along with ''non native species'' and ''introduced species'' in current literature and publications; other similar terms include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', and ''foreign species''. 1. Any ''species'' or other viable biological material that enters an ecosystem beyond its historic range, including any such organism transferred from one country into another (EPA 1990). 2. A plant or animal that is not native to the area in which it occurs which was either intentionally or unintentionally introduced (Williams and Meffe 2005). \n\n:;[[Non native species]]: This term, along with the terms ''introduced species'' and ''nonindigenous species'', is one of the most commonly used terms to describe a plant or animal ''species'' that is not originally from the area in which it occurs. Similar terms also include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', and ''foreign species''. This term has also been defined as: 1. A ''species'' whose presence is due to ''intentional'' or ''unintentional introduction'' as a result of human activity (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). 2. A ''species'' that has been introduced to an area or ''bioregion'' (Heutte and Bella 2003). \n\n:;[[Noxious weed]]: This term is frequently a legal term in state code, denoting a special status of the plant as, for example, ''prohibited'' or ''restricted''. 1. Native or non-native plants, or plant products, that injure or cause damage to interests of agriculture, irrigation, navigation, natural resources, public health, or the environment (Heutte and Bella 2003). 2. Implies a ''species''\u2019 adverse effects on humans, either directly (e.g. ''species'' that produce toxins that are harmful to humans) or indirectly (e.g. species that infest nature reserves) (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). 3. Any ''species'' of plants, either annual, biennial, or perennial; reproduced by seed, root, underground stem, or bulblet; which when established is or may become destructive and difficult to control by ordinary means of cultivation or other farm practices (Heutte and Bella 2003). \n\n:;Pathway (See Path): 1. Used to mean ''vector'', purpose (the reason why a ''species'' is moved), and route (the geographic corridor from one point to another) (Carlton 2001). 2. Mode by which a ''species'' establishes and continues to exist in a new environment (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Pest (organism)|Pest]]: 1. An animal that competes with humans by consuming or damaging food, fiber, or other materials intended for human consumption or use, such as an insect consuming a cropfield (Allaby 1998) 2. Synonymous to ''invasive species'' (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).\n\n:;[[Pesticide]]: A chemical or biological agent intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate plant or animal life and any substance intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant, including insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, herbicides, nematocides, and biocides (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Population]]: A group of potentially inter-breeding individuals of the same ''species'' found in the same place at the same time (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;[[Prohibited weed]]: A specific legal term applied to a plant or plant part that may not be brought into a state (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Restricted weed]]: A specific legal term applied to a plant or plant part that may only be brought into a state in limited quantities (Heutte and Bella 2003).\n\n:;[[Ruderal species]]: A plant associated with human dwellings, construction, or agriculture, that usually colonizes disturbed or waste ground. Ruderals are often ''weeds'' which have high demands for nutrients and are intolerant of competition. See also ''native weed or invasive native'' (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;[[Soil seed bank|Seed bank]]: Seeds that become incorporated into the soil (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;[[Species]]: A group of organisms formally recognized as distinct from other groups; the taxon rank in the hierarchy of biological classification below genus; the basic unit of biological classification, defined by the reproductive isolation of the group from all other groups of organisms (Allaby 1998). \n\n:;[[Tens rule]]: 1. Describes how approximately ten percent of ''species'' pass through each transition from being imported to becoming ''casual'' to becoming established, and finally becoming a ''weed'' (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). 2. Ten percent of the ''introduced species'' establish themselves in the non native continent and ten percent of these, in turn, spread or are ''pests'' although many exceptions to this rule have been noted (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).\n\n:;Time lag: 1. Time between introduction, establishment, and spread of a ''species'' (Jeschke and Strayer 2005). 2. The time between when a ''species'' is introduced and when its ''population'' growth explodes (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).\n\n:;[[Unintentional introduction]]: An introduction of ''nonindigenous species'' that occurs as the result of activities other than the purposeful or intentional introduction of the ''species'' involved, such as the transport of ''nonindigenous species'' in ballast or in water used to transport fish, mollusks or crustaceans for aquaculture or other purposes (EPA 1990). \n\n:;Vector (See [[Vector (epidemiology)]]): The physical means or agent by which a ''species'' is transported, such as ballast water, ships\u2019 hulls, boats, hiking boats, cars, vehicles, packing material, or soil in nursery stock (Carlton 2001). See also ''pathway''. \n\n:;[[Weed]]: 1. A plant in the wrong place, being one that occurs opportunistically on land or in water that has been disturbed by human activities (see also ''ruderal species'' and ''native weed or invasive native''), or on cultivated land, where it competes for nutrients, water, sunlight, or other resources with cultivated plants such as food crops. Under different circumstances the weed plant itself may be cultivated for different purposes (Allaby 1998). 2. A ''native'' or ''introduced species'' that has a perceived negative ecological or economic effect on agricultural or natural ecosystems (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). 3. A plant growing in an area where it is not wanted (Royer and Dickinson 1999).\n\n===Legal definitions===\n\n:;[[Invasive species (United States)]]: Executive Order 13112 (1999) defines this term as an ''alien species'' whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health. Website: [http://www.epa.gov/owow/invasive_species/EO13112.pdf]\n\n:;[[Introduction (United States)]]: Executive Order 13112 (1999) defines this term as the intentional or unintentional escape, release, dissemination, or placement of a ''species'' into an ecosystem as a result of human activity. Website: [http://www.epa.gov/owow/invasive_species/EO13112.pdf]\n\n:;[[Native species (United States)]]: Executive Order 13112 (1999) defines this term as a ''species'' with respect to a particular ecosystem that historically occurred or currently occurs in that ecosystem rather than as a result of an introduction.

Holyfield would get back up, but his trainer [[Don Turner]] decided to stop the fight by throwing in the towel, automatically giving Toney the victory by technical knockout at 1:42 of the round.<ref>[https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2003/10/05/Toney-gets-TKO-of-Holyfield/86891065335355/?ur3=1 Toney gets TKO of Holyfield], UPI article, 2003-10-05, Retrieved on 2020-04-06</ref>\n\nThough Holyfield admitted that \"Toney did beat me up\" and there were calls for his retirement following consecutive defeats, Holyfield decided to put retirement off, stating \"No, I'm not going to retire, I'm going back to the drawing board.\"<ref>[https://www.espn.com/boxing/news/2003/1004/1630682.html Holyfield's career may be over], ESPN article, 2003-10-05, Retrieved on 2020-04-08</ref>  \n\n==Fight card==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Weight Class\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Weight\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"|\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| vs.\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"|\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Method\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Round\n! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Notes\n|-\n|Heavyweight\n|200+ lbs.\n|'''[[James Toney]]'''\n|def.\n|[[Evander Holyfield]]\n|align=center|TKO\n|align=center|9/12\n|-\n|Super Featherweight\n|126 lbs.\n|'''[[Joel Casamayor]]''' \n|def.\n|[[Diego Corrales]]\n|align=center|TKO\n|align=center|6/12\n|{{ref|Joel Casamayor vs. Diego Corrales|Note 1}}\n|-\n|Bantamweight\n|118 lbs.\n|'''[[Cruz Carbajal]]''' (c)\n|def\n|Gerardo Espinoza\n|align=center|TKO\n|align=center|8/12\n|{{ref|Cruz Carbajal vs. Gerardo Espinoza|Note 2}}\n|-\n|Middleweight\n|160 lbs.\n|'''[[Keith Holmes (boxer)|Keith Holmes]]'''\n|def\n|Jason Papillion\n|align=center|TKO\n|align=center|8/8\n|}\n{{note|Joel Casamayor vs. Diego Corrales|Note 1|For [[International Boxing Association (professional)|IBA]] Super Featherweight title}}<br>{{note|Cruz Carbajal vs. Gerardo Espinoza|Note 2|For [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] Bantamweight title}}\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Holyfield, Toney}}\n{{Evander Holyfield}}\n[[Category:2003 in boxing]]\n[[Category:Boxing in Las Vegas]]\n[[Category:Boxing on Showtime]]\n[[Category:Boxing matches involving Evander Holyfield|Toney]]\n[[Category:October 2003 sports events in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Nat965", "label": "safe", "comment": "ApplyGen fix(es),typo(s) fixed: a IBF \u2192 an IBF", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_Holyfield_vs._James_Toney"}
