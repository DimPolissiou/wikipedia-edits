It was then rolled to the shore by fish. Doves sat on the egg until it hatched, out from which came Aphrodite. As a sign of gratitude towards the fish, Aphrodite put the fish into the night sky.{{sfn|Star Tales}} Because of these myths, the Pisces constellation was also known as \"Venus et Cupido,\" \"Venus Syria cum Cupidine,\" \"Venus cum Adone,\" \"Dione\" and \"Veneris Mater,\"{{sfn|Allen|1899|p=339}} the latter being the formal Latin term for mother.\n\nThe Greek myth on the origin of the sign of Pisces has been cited by English astrologer [[Richard James Morrison]] as an example of the fables that arose from the original astrological doctrine, and that the \"original intent of [it] was afterwards corrupted both by poets and priests.\"{{sfn|The Metropolitan|1834|p=94}}\n\n===In modern mythology and religion===\n[[Purim]], a [[Jewish holiday]], falls at the full moon preceding the Passover, which was set by the full moon in Aries, which follows Pisces.{{sfn|Bobrick|2006|p=9}} The story of the birth of Christ is said to be a result of the spring equinox entering into the Pisces, as the Savior of the World appeared as the Fisher of Men.

The principal islands are [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]], [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] and [[Bryher]]. The island of [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] is the most southerly point in the United Kingdom, being over {{convert|4|mi}} further south than the most southerly point of the [[British mainland]] at [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]].\n\nThe population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/scilly-islands/e06000053 |title=UK Census Data 2011 |work=UK Census Data |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}</ref> Scilly forms part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]].\n\nThe adjective \"Scillonian\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The [[Duchy of Cornwall]] owns most of the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\u2014particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] ('Tin Isles') believed by some to have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much [[tin]].\n\nThe isles were off the coast of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic Celtic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] and later its offshoot, Kernow ([[Cornwall]]), and may have been a part of these polities until their conquest by the English in the 10th century AD.\n\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400\u2013500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\".<ref>'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L.

The men of this island even now preserve an old custom: they do not use coins. They give and accept, obtaining the necessities of life by exchange rather than by money.

This may be a [[folk memory]] of inundated lands, but this legend is also common among the [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] peoples; the legend of [[Ys]] is a parallel and cognate legend in [[Brittany]] as is that of {{lang|cy|[[Cantre'r Gwaelod]]}} in [[Wales]].\n\nScilly has been identified as the place of exile of two heretical 4th century bishops, Instantius and Tiberianus, who were followers of [[Priscillian]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.html?term=Priscillianus%20and%20Priscillianism,%20Priscillian |title=Priscillianus and Priscillianism |work=Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of Sixth Century |accessdate=11 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Norse and Norman period===\n[[File:Peter nicolai arbo, olaf tryggvasson king.jpg|thumb|[[Olaf I of Norway|Olaf Tryggvason]], who visited the islands in 986.

Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably a follower of [[Priscillian]] and part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\n<blockquote>Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.</blockquote>\n\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[Mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\n\nWith the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \"[[Exeter]] Domesday\" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].\n\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,<ref name=\"OrkSaga\">Anderson, Joseph (Ed.) (1893) ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. Translated by J\u00f3n A. Hjaltalin & Gilbert Goudie. Edinburgh. James Thin and Mercat Press (1990 reprint). {{ISBN|0-901824-25-9}}</ref> recorded in the ''{{lang|non|[[Orkneyinga saga]]}}''\u2014 [[Sweyn Asleifsson]] \"went south, under Ireland, and seized a barge belonging to some monks in Syllingar and plundered it\".<ref name=OrkSaga /> (Chap LXXIII)\n\n<blockquote>...the three chiefs \u2013 Swein, \u00deorbj\u00f6rn and Eirik \u2013 went out on a plundering expedition. They went first to the Su\u00f0reyar [Hebrides], and all along the west to the Syllingar, where they gained a great victory in Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn on Columba's-mass [9 June], and took much booty. Then they returned to the Orkneys.<ref name=OrkSaga /></blockquote>\n\n\"{{lang|non|Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn}}\" literally means \"Mary's Harbour/Haven\". The name does not make it clear if it referred to a harbour on a larger island than today's St Mary's, or a whole island.\n\nIt is generally considered that Cornwall, and possibly the Isles of Scilly, came under the dominion of the English Crown late in the reign of [[\u00c6thelstan]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 924\u2013939). In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100\u201335) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}</ref>\n\n===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===\n[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]\n[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]\n\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\n\n<blockquote>stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&queryType=1&resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock.

The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\n\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation.

Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]\u2014a gun platform on the west side of Tresco\u2014using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]].

They were styled ''Governors of Scilly'' and the Godolphins and their Osborne relatives held this position until 1834. In 1834 [[Augustus Smith (politician)|Augustus John Smith]] acquired the lease from the Duchy for \u00a320,000.{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} Smith created the title ''Lord Proprietor of the Isles of Scilly'' for himself, and many of his actions were unpopular. The lease remained in his family until it expired for most of the Isles in 1920 when ownership reverted to the Duchy of Cornwall. Today, the Dorrien-Smith estate still holds the lease for the island of [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]].\n\n* 1568\u20131608 [[Francis Godolphin (1540\u20131608)|Sir Francis Godolphin]] (1540\u20131608)\n* 1608\u20131613 [[William Godolphin (1567\u20131613)|Sir William Godolphin]] of [[Godolphin Estate|Godolphin]] (1567\u20131613)\n* 1613\u20131636 [[William Godolphin (1611\u20131636)|William Godolphin]] (1611\u20131636)\n* 1636\u20131643 [[Sidney Godolphin (poet)|Sidney Godolphin]] (1610\u20131643)\n* 1643\u20131646 [[Francis Godolphin (1605\u20131667)|Sir Francis Godolphin]] of [[Godolphin Estate|Godolphin]] (1605\u20131647)\n* 1647\u20131648 [[Anthony Buller (1613\u20131679)|Anthony Buller]] (Parliamentarian)\n* 1649\u20131651 [[John Grenville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]] (Royalist)\n* 1651\u20131660 [[Joseph Hunkin (Governor of Scilly)|Joseph Hunkin]]<ref>Per slate tablet on external wall of Old Town Church, [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly]], inscribed as follows: ''\"To the memory of Francys, the wife of Joseph Hunkyn of Gatherly in the parish of Lifton in Devon, Governour of the Iland of Silly.

The chief agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly [[daffodil]]s. Exposure to [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] winds also means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time.

The designation covers the entire archipelago, including the uninhabited islands and rocks, and is the smallest such area in the UK. The islands of Annet and Samson have large [[tern]]eries and the islands are well populated by [[pinniped|seals]]. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the [[lesser white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura suaveolens''), where it is known locally as a \"''teak''\" or \"''teke''\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Robinson, H.W. |year=1925 |title=A new British animal discovered in Scilly |newspaper=Scillonian |volume=4 |pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nThe islands are famous among [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.\n[[File:Isles of Scilly NASA.jpg|thumb|The Isles of Scilly, viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\n===Tidal influx===\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St.&nbsp;Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St.&nbsp;Martin's (requires very low tides). From St.&nbsp;Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St.&nbsp;Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St.&nbsp;Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From St.&nbsp;Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Isles of Scilly features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] : ''Cfb'') bordering on a rare 49\u00b0N [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_528495_en.html |title=Isles of Scilly climate |department=news |website=exeter.ac.uk}}</ref> The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}, by far the warmest place in the British Isles.

Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\n\n==Economy==\n===Historical context===\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.<ref>Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980</ref><ref name=\"partnership\">''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001\u20132004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001</ref><ref>Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]\n\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85 percent of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.<ref name=\"council\">''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004</ref><ref name=\"touristboard\">''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004</ref> The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\n\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. \"The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out\".<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] (\"birders\") arrive.\n\n====Ornithology====\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\n\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \"[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]\".\n\nThe islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].\n\n===Employment===\nThe predominance of tourism means that \"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom\". Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.<ref name=\"partnership\" /> However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.<ref>J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002</ref>\n\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs 'out of season' to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a \u2018[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]\u2019.\n\n===Taxation===\nThe islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Electric golf buggy on St Marys.jpg|thumb|An electric golf buggy on St Mary's; these are road licensed and available for hire, as are bicycles, for use on public roads on the island.]]\n[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]\n\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island.

The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\n\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.<ref name=\"martin\">Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004</ref> The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.<ref name=\"SWHB\">''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004</ref><ref name=\"fleming\">S. Fleming et al., ''\"In from the cold\" A report on Cornwall\u2019s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003</ref>\n\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost \u00a35,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of 'key workers' and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.<ref name=\"council\" /><ref name=\"fleming\" />\n\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.<ref name=\"The Cornishman\">''The Cornishman'', \"Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy\", 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===People===\n{{Main|Cornish people|English people}}\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],<ref name=ONS1 /> with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.<ref name=ONS2>{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly \u2013 Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276909&c=TR21+0LW&d=13&e=13&g=431427&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1354783435942&enc=1&dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}</ref> Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|central Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers.

The principal islands are [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]], [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] and [[Bryher]]. The island of [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] is the most southerly point in the United Kingdom, being over {{convert|4|mi}} further south than the most southerly point of the [[British mainland]] at [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]].\n\nThe population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/scilly-islands/e06000053 |title=UK Census Data 2011 |work=UK Census Data |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}</ref> Scilly forms part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]].\n\nThe adjective \"Scillonian\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The [[Duchy of Cornwall]] owns most of the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\u2014particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] ('Tin Isles') believed by some to have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much [[tin]].\n\nThe isles were off the coast of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic Celtic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] and later its offshoot, Kernow ([[Cornwall]]), and may have been a part of these polities until their conquest by the English in the 10th century AD.\n\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400\u2013500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\".<ref>'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L.

The men of this island even now preserve an old custom: they do not use coins. They give and accept, obtaining the necessities of life by exchange rather than by money.

Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably a follower of [[Priscillian]] and part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\n<blockquote>Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.</blockquote>\n\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[Mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\n\nWith the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \"[[Exeter]] Domesday\" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].\n\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,<ref name=\"OrkSaga\">Anderson, Joseph (Ed.) (1893) ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. Translated by J\u00f3n A. Hjaltalin & Gilbert Goudie. Edinburgh.

Then they returned to the Orkneys.<ref name=OrkSaga /></blockquote>\n\n\"{{lang|non|Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn}}\" literally means \"Mary's Harbour/Haven\". The name does not make it clear if it referred to a harbour on a larger island than today's St Mary's, or a whole island.\n\nIt is generally considered that Cornwall, and possibly the Isles of Scilly, came under the dominion of the English Crown late in the reign of [[\u00c6thelstan]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 924\u2013939). In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100\u201335) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}</ref>\n\n===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===\n[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]\n[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]\n\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\n\n<blockquote>stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&queryType=1&resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock.

The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\n\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June, but declined to challenge Blake for the isles.<ref>Blakemore, Richard J. and Marphy, Elaine. (2018).

Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]\u2014a gun platform on the west side of Tresco\u2014using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]]. In March 1646 the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]] escaped from Falmouth to the isles before seeking a safer base in Jersey.<ref>Blakemore & Murphy.

The chief agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly [[daffodil]]s. Exposure to [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] winds also means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time.

The islands of Annet and Samson have large [[tern]]eries and the islands are well populated by [[pinniped|seals]]. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the [[lesser white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura suaveolens''), where it is known locally as a \"''teak''\" or \"''teke''\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Robinson, H.W. |year=1925 |title=A new British animal discovered in Scilly |newspaper=Scillonian |volume=4 |pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nThe islands are famous among [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.\n[[File:Isles of Scilly NASA.jpg|thumb|The Isles of Scilly, viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\n===Tidal influx===\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St.&nbsp;Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St.&nbsp;Martin's (requires very low tides). From St.&nbsp;Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St.&nbsp;Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St.&nbsp;Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From St.&nbsp;Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Isles of Scilly features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] : ''Cfb'') bordering on a rare 49\u00b0N [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_528495_en.html |title=Isles of Scilly climate |department=news |website=exeter.ac.uk}}</ref> The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}, by far the warmest place in the British Isles.

Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\n\n==Economy==\n===Historical context===\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.<ref>Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980</ref><ref name=\"partnership\">''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001\u20132004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001</ref><ref>Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]\n\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85 percent of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.<ref name=\"council\">''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004</ref><ref name=\"touristboard\">''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004</ref> The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\n\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. \"The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out\".<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] (\"birders\") arrive.\n\n====Ornithology====\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\n\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \"[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]\".\n\nThe islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].\n\n===Employment===\nThe predominance of tourism means that \"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom\". Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.<ref name=\"partnership\" /> However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.<ref>J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002</ref>\n\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs 'out of season' to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a \u2018[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]\u2019.\n\n===Taxation===\nThe islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Electric golf buggy on St Marys.jpg|thumb|An electric golf buggy on St Mary's; these are road licensed and available for hire, as are bicycles, for use on public roads on the island.]]\n[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]\n\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island.

[[Fixed-wing aircraft]] services, operated by [[Isles of Scilly Skybus]], operate from [[Land's End Airport|Land's End]], [[Newquay Cornwall Airport|Newquay]] and [[Exeter International Airport|Exeter]].<ref name=iossb>{{cite web |url=http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/timetable_skybus.asp |title=Skybus Timetables |publisher=Skybus |accessdate=8 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116023855/http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/timetable_skybus.asp |archivedate=16 November 2013}}</ref>  There is currently no Sunday air transport.\n\nAt present all air and sea, passenger and freight transport between the Isles of Scilly and the mainland is owned by one company - The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company.  This is often blamed for high year-on-year fare increases.  There have been various local attempts to create competition, but as yet none have succeeded.\n\nThe scheduled [[helicopter]] service, which previously linked [[Penzance Heliport]] with St Mary's Airport and [[Tresco Heliport]], ceased at the end of October 2012. A new heliport is currently under construction in Penzance and helicopter services to Tresco and St Mary's are expected to commence in 2019 or 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://penzanceheliport.co.uk/|title=Isles of Scilly Helicopter from Penzance Heliport|website=Penzance Heliport|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nThe [[freehold (law)|freehold land]] of the islands is the property of the Duchy of Cornwall (except for [[Hugh Town]] on St Mary's, which was sold to the inhabitants in 1949).

The Trust pays a rent to the Duchy of one daffodil per year!}}</ref> The trust currently has four full-time salaried staff and 12 trustees, who are all residents of the Isles. The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\n\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.<ref name=\"martin\">Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004</ref> The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.<ref name=\"SWHB\">''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004</ref><ref name=\"fleming\">S. Fleming et al., ''\"In from the cold\" A report on Cornwall\u2019s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003</ref>\n\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost \u00a35,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of 'key workers' and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.<ref name=\"council\" /><ref name=\"fleming\" />\n\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.<ref name=\"The Cornishman\">''The Cornishman'', \"Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy\", 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===People===\n{{Main|Cornish people|English people}}\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],<ref name=ONS1 /> with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.<ref name=ONS2>{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly \u2013 Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276909&c=TR21+0LW&d=13&e=13&g=431427&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1354783435942&enc=1&dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}</ref> Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|central Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers.

Gig racing has been said to derive from the race to collect [[marine salvage|salvage]] from shipwrecks on the rocks around Scilly, but the race was actually to deliver a [[harbour pilot|pilot]] onto incoming vessels, to guide them through the hazardous reefs and shallows. (The boats are correctly termed \"pilot gigs\"). The [[World Pilot Gig Championships]] are held annually over the May Day bank holiday weekend. The event originally involved crews from the Islands and a few crews from Cornwall, but in the intervening years the number of gigs attending has increased, with crews coming from all over the South-West and as far afield as the Netherlands and the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldgigs.co.uk/|title=World Pilot Gig Championships&nbsp;\u2013 Isles of Scilly |author1=Rick Persich |author2=Chairman World Pilot Gigs Championships Committee |accessdate=26 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe Isles of Scilly feature what is reportedly the smallest [[association football|football]] league in the world, the [[Isles of Scilly Football League]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Rory |date=22 December 2016 |title=Welcome to the World's Smallest Soccer League.

The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior.

Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side \"\u2026the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy.\" (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent.
