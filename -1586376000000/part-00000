{"title_page": "Deaths in 2020", "text_new": "{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Short description|List of notable individuals who died in 2020}}\nThe following deaths of notable individuals occurred in 2020. Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===9===\n\n===8===\n*[[Richard L.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===9===\n\n===8===\n*[[Richard L.

It was carried underground by the [[Tremont Street Subway]] (now part of the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]]), returning above ground at the [[Pleasant Street Incline]] (now closed, located just south of [[Boylston station]]). A temporary link connected from there to the [[Washington Street Elevated]], which in 1901 ran from this point via Washington Street to Dudley Square (which is most of what is now Phase 1 of the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]]).\n\nAlso in 1901, the [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]] opened, branching at Causeway Street to provide an alternate route through downtown Boston (along the shoreline, where today there is no rail transit) to the Washington Street Elevated.\n\nIn 1908, a new '''Washington Street Tunnel''' opened, allowing Main Line service to travel from the [[Charlestown Elevated]], underground via an additional new portal at the [[Canal Street Incline]], under downtown Boston and back up again to meet the Washington Street Elevated and Atlantic Avenue Elevated near [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]]. The stations wee richly decorated with tile work, mosaics, and copper; after criticism of the large [[Tremont Street Subway]] headhouses, most entrances were comparatively modest and set into buildings.<ref name=newboston>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Es9AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA307 |title=Rapid Transit and Civic Beauty |magazine=New Boston |date=November 1910 |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=307\u2013314 |first=Frederick W. |last=Coburn |via=Google Books}}</ref> Use of the parallel Tremont Street Subway was returned exclusively to [[streetcar]]s.\n\nBy 1909, the Washington Street Elevated had been extended south to {{bts|Forest Hills}}. Trains from Washington Street were routed through the new subway, either all the way to Sullivan Square, or back around in a loop via the subway and then the Atlantic Avenue Elevated.\n\nIn 1919, the same year that the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was partially damaged in Boston's [[Great Molasses Flood]], the Charlestown Elevated was extended north from Sullivan Square to [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], over surface right-of-way parallel to [[Massachusetts Route 99|Alford Street/Broadway]], with a [[Movable bridge|drawbridge]] over the [[Mystic River]].<ref name=netransit /> The Boston Elevated had long-term plans to continue this extension further north to [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]], a goal which would only be achieved decades later, under [[MBTA|public ownership]] and not via the Everett route.\n\n===Closure of Atlantic Avenue Elevated and ownership changes===\n[[File:Rowes Wharf Station (13083218675).jpg|thumb|left|Rowes Wharf station on the Atlantic Avenue Elevated in 1942 \u2013 four years after closure \u2013 just before being demolished]]\nFollowing a 1928 accident at a tight curve on Beach Street, the southern portion of the [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]], between South Station and Tower D on Washington Street, was closed (except for rush-hour trips from Dudley to North Station via the Elevated), breaking the loop; non-rush-hour Atlantic Avenue service was reduced to a shuttle between North and South Stations.<ref name=\"netransit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transithistory.org/roster/MBTARouteHistory.pdf|title=Changes to Transit Service in the MBTA district|last=Belcher|first=Jonathan|date=27 June 2015|format=PDF|publisher=NETransit|accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref>  In 1938, the remainder of the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was closed, leaving the subway as the only route through downtown \u2013 what is now the Orange Line between {{bts|Haymarket}} and {{bts|Chinatown}} stations.\n\nOwnership of the railway was transferred from the private Boston Elevated Railway to the public Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) in 1947; the MTA was itself reconstituted as the modern [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) in 1964.\n\n===Orange Line naming===\n[[File:Tile mosaic at Boylston Street station, October 1914.jpg|thumb|left|Station sign at Boylston Street (now Chinatown) station in 1914.

As a result of this review, the [[Charlestown Elevated]] \u2013 which served the [[Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] neighborhood north of downtown Boston and the inner suburb of [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]] \u2013 was demolished and replaced in 1975.\n\nThe '''Haymarket North Extension''' rerouted the Orange Line through an [[Haymarket North Extension|underwater crossing]] of the [[Charles River]]. Service in Charlestown was replaced with service along [[Boston and Maine]] tracks routed partially beneath an elevated section of [[Interstate 93]], ultimately to {{bts|Wellington}} and then to {{bts|Oak Grove}} in [[Malden, Massachusetts]] instead of Everett. Rail service to Everett was replaced with buses.\n\n===Closure of Washington Street Elevated===\n[[File:ELEVATED RAILROAD STRUCTURE AND BLIGHTED AREA BELOW WASHINGTON STREET SOUTH FROM THE CORNER OF BARTLETT - NARA - 550012.tif|thumb|left|View under Washington Street Elevated, looking south from Bartlett Street (1973)]]\nConstruction of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] into downtown Boston was cancelled in 1972 after [[Freeway revolt|local protest]] over the necessary demolition.

After this re-routing was accomplished in 1987, the Washington Street Elevated was torn down, the last major segment of the original elevated line to be demolished.\n\n[[File:South Bay Tunnel junction HDR.JPG|thumb|right|Modern view from the platform at {{bts|Chinatown}} shows the remains of the Washington Street Tunnel that led to the Elevated, in the background.

On May 4, 1987, the Orange Line was rerouted from the southern end of the Washington Street Tunnel onto the new Southwest Corridor. Instead of rising up to elevated tracks, it now veered west at the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] and followed the Pike and the old [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] right-of-way to the existing [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] stop at {{bts|Back Bay}}. It then continued along new tracks, partially covered and partially open but depressed, to {{bts|Forest Hills}}.

In 2002, Phase 1 of the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] [[bus rapid transit]] was added to connect Washington Street to the downtown subways, attempting to address this service need.

The aboveground sections of the Orange and Red lines were particularly vulnerable due to their exposed third rail, which iced over during storms. When a single train stopped due to power loss, other trains soon stopped as well; without continually running trains pushing snow off the rails, the lines were quickly covered in snow. (Because the Blue Line was built with overhead lines on its surface section due to its proximity to corrosive salt air, it was not subject to icing issues.)\n\nStarting in 2015, the MBTA began implementing its $83.7 million Winter Resiliency Program, much of which focused on preventing similar issues with the Orange and Red lines. The [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]] section of the Orange Line is located in a trench and is protected from the worst weather, but the 1970s-built [[Haymarket North Extension]] had older infrastructure and was in worse shape. From {{bts|Sullivan Square}} north, it is exposed to the weather and largely built on an embankment, rendering it more vulnerable. That section is receiving new heated third rail, switch heaters, and snow fences to reduce the impacts of inclement weather.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/business/news/2015/09/23/how-the-mbta-getting-winter-ready/SeTjLsOSUUZ1nGlIAc5p3N/story.html |title=Winter is coming, and the MBTA is getting ready |newspaper=Boston Globe |last=Vaccaro |first=Adam |date=23 September 2015 |accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/news_events/?id=6442454500&month=&year |title=Gov.

These cars, known as 01100s, had been in service since the 1950s, and saw service on both the elevated and the northern extension before they were retired in 1981. Several remained on the property for some time before being scrapped. The 01100 cars were a favorite for fans, as the small motorman's cab enabled passengers to stand at the front for an operator's-eye view.\n\nThe Orange Line is [[standard gauge]] [[heavy rail]] and uses a [[third rail]] for power. The current fleet was built between 1979 and 1981 by [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]] (now [[Alstom]]) of [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], Canada. They are 65 feet (20 m) long and 9&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in (2.8 m) wide, with three pairs of doors on each side. They are based on the PA3 model used by [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] in [[New Jersey]] and the R44/R46/R62/R68 models used by [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] in [[New York City]] There are 120 cars, numbered 01200-01319.

It extends from {{bts|Forest Hills}} in [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts|Jamaica Plain]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in the south to {{bts|Oak Grove}} in [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]] in the north.  It meets the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] at {{bts|Downtown Crossing}}, the [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] at {{bts|State}}, and the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] at {{bts|Haymarket}} and [[North Station]].

From 1901 to 1987, it provided the first elevated rapid transit in Boston; the [[Washington Street Elevated|last elevated section]] was torn down in 1987 when the southern portion of the line was moved to the [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]].\n\nAll stations on the Orange Line are [[handicapped accessible]]. These stations are equipped with high-level platforms for easy boarding, as well as elevators for easy platform access.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of the MBTA}}\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Charlestown El on Charlestown Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The Charlestown El running over the Charlestown Bridge]]\nThe Main Line of the electric [[Boston Elevated Railway]] opened in segments, starting in 1901. It proceeded from [[Sullivan Square]] along the [[Charlestown Elevated]] to the [[Canal Street Incline]] near [[North Station]]. It was carried underground by the [[Tremont Street Subway]] (now part of the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]]), returning above ground at the [[Pleasant Street Incline]] (now closed, located just south of [[Boylston station]]). A temporary link connected from there to the [[Washington Street Elevated]], which in 1901 ran from this point via Washington Street to Dudley Square (which is most of what is now Phase 1 of the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]]).\n\nAlso in 1901, the [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]] opened, branching at Causeway Street to provide an alternate route through downtown Boston (along the shoreline, where today there is no rail transit) to the Washington Street Elevated.\n\nIn 1908, a new '''Washington Street Tunnel''' opened, allowing Main Line service to travel from the [[Charlestown Elevated]], underground via an additional new portal at the [[Canal Street Incline]], under downtown Boston and back up again to meet the Washington Street Elevated and Atlantic Avenue Elevated near [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]]. The stations wee richly decorated with tile work, mosaics, and copper; after criticism of the large [[Tremont Street Subway]] headhouses, most entrances were comparatively modest and set into buildings.<ref name=newboston>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Es9AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA307 |title=Rapid Transit and Civic Beauty |magazine=New Boston |date=November 1910 |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=307\u2013314 |first=Frederick W. |last=Coburn |via=Google Books}}</ref> Use of the parallel Tremont Street Subway was returned exclusively to [[streetcar]]s.\n\nBy 1909, the Washington Street Elevated had been extended south to {{bts|Forest Hills}}. Trains from Washington Street were routed through the new subway, either all the way to Sullivan Square, or back around in a loop via the subway and then the Atlantic Avenue Elevated.\n\nIn 1919, the same year that the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was partially damaged in Boston's [[Great Molasses Flood]], the Charlestown Elevated was extended north from Sullivan Square to [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], over surface right-of-way parallel to [[Massachusetts Route 99|Alford Street/Broadway]], with a [[Movable bridge|drawbridge]] over the [[Mystic River]].<ref name=netransit /> The Boston Elevated had long-term plans to continue this extension further north to [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]], a goal which would only be achieved decades later, under [[MBTA|public ownership]] and not via the Everett route.\n\n===Closure of Atlantic Avenue Elevated and ownership changes===\n[[File:Rowes Wharf Station (13083218675).jpg|thumb|left|Rowes Wharf station on the Atlantic Avenue Elevated in 1942 \u2013 four years after closure \u2013 just before being demolished]]\nFollowing a 1928 accident at a tight curve on Beach Street, the southern portion of the [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]], between South Station and Tower D on Washington Street, was closed (except for rush-hour trips from Dudley to North Station via the Elevated), breaking the loop; non-rush-hour Atlantic Avenue service was reduced to a shuttle between North and South Stations.<ref name=\"netransit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transithistory.org/roster/MBTARouteHistory.pdf|title=Changes to Transit Service in the MBTA district|last=Belcher|first=Jonathan|date=27 June 2015|format=PDF|publisher=NETransit|accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref>  In 1938, the remainder of the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was closed, leaving the subway as the only route through downtown \u2013 what is now the Orange Line between {{bts|Haymarket}} and {{bts|Chinatown}} stations.\n\nOwnership of the railway was transferred from the private Boston Elevated Railway to the public Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) in 1947; the MTA was itself reconstituted as the modern [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) in 1964.\n\n===Orange Line naming===\n[[File:Tile mosaic at Boylston Street station, October 1914.jpg|thumb|left|Station sign at Boylston Street (now Chinatown) station in 1914.

As a result of this review, the [[Charlestown Elevated]] \u2013 which served the [[Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] neighborhood north of downtown Boston and the inner suburb of [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]] \u2013 was demolished and replaced in 1975.\n\nThe '''Haymarket North Extension''' rerouted the Orange Line through an [[Haymarket North Extension|underwater crossing]] of the [[Charles River]]. Service in Charlestown was replaced with service along [[Boston and Maine]] tracks routed partially beneath an elevated section of [[Interstate 93]], ultimately to {{bts|Wellington}} and then to {{bts|Oak Grove}} in [[Malden, Massachusetts]] instead of Everett. Rail service to Everett was replaced with buses.\n\n===Closure of Washington Street Elevated===\n[[File:ELEVATED RAILROAD STRUCTURE AND BLIGHTED AREA BELOW WASHINGTON STREET SOUTH FROM THE CORNER OF BARTLETT - NARA - 550012.tif|thumb|left|View under Washington Street Elevated, looking south from Bartlett Street (1973)]]\nConstruction of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] into downtown Boston was cancelled in 1972 after [[Freeway revolt|local protest]] over the necessary demolition.

After this re-routing was accomplished in 1987, the Washington Street Elevated was torn down, the last major segment of the original elevated line to be demolished.\n\n[[File:South Bay Tunnel junction HDR.JPG|thumb|right|Modern view from the platform at {{bts|Chinatown}} shows the remains of the Washington Street Tunnel that led to the Elevated, in the background.

On May 4, 1987, the Orange Line was rerouted from the southern end of the Washington Street Tunnel onto the new Southwest Corridor. Instead of rising up to elevated tracks, it now veered west at the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] and followed the Pike and the old [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] right-of-way to the existing [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] stop at {{bts|Back Bay}}. It then continued along new tracks, partially covered and partially open but depressed, to {{bts|Forest Hills}}.

Originally, plans provided for [[light rail vehicle]]s [[street running]] in mixed traffic, from Washington Street to Dudley Square, then diverting southeastward on Warren Street towards Dorchester. In 2002, Phase 1 of the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] [[bus rapid transit]] was added to connect Washington Street to the downtown subways, attempting to address this service need.

The aboveground sections of the Orange and Red lines were particularly vulnerable due to their exposed third rail, which iced over during storms. When a single train stopped due to power loss, other trains soon stopped as well; without continually running trains pushing snow off the rails, the lines were quickly covered in snow. (Because the Blue Line was built with overhead lines on its surface section due to its proximity to corrosive salt air, it was not subject to icing issues.)\n\nStarting in 2015, the MBTA began implementing its $83.7 million Winter Resiliency Program, much of which focused on preventing similar issues with the Orange and Red lines. The [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]] section of the Orange Line is located in a trench and is protected from the worst weather, but the 1970s-built [[Haymarket North Extension]] had older infrastructure and was in worse shape.

These cars, known as 01100s, had been in service since the 1950s, and saw service on both the elevated and the northern extension before they were retired in 1981. Several remained on the property for some time before being scrapped. The 01100 cars were a favorite for fans, as the small motorman's cab enabled passengers to stand at the front for an operator's-eye view.\n\nThe Orange Line is [[standard gauge]] [[heavy rail]] and uses a [[third rail]] for power. The current fleet was built between 1979 and 1981 by [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]] (now [[Alstom]]) of [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], Canada. They are 65 feet (20 m) long and 9&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in (2.8 m) wide, with three pairs of doors on each side. They are based on the PA3 model used by [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] in [[New Jersey]] and the R44/R46/R62/R68 models used by [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] in [[New York City]] There are 120 cars, numbered 01200-01319.

The agency originally planned for a simultaneous order for 146 Orange Line cars (to replace the whole fleet) and 74 Red Line cars (to replace the older 1500 and 1600 series cars). A similar order was used in the late 1970s for the current Orange Line cars and the old Blue Line cars, ordered at the same time and largely identical except for size and color.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctps.org/data/pdf/studies/transit/pmt/PMT_Ch5.pdf |title=CHAPTER 5: Priorities for Achieving a State of Good Repair |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |date=December 2009 |page=5-2 |work=The Program for Mass Transportation |author=Central Transportation Planning Staff}}</ref> In October 2013, MassDOT announced plans for a $1.3 billion subway car order for the Orange and Red Lines, which would provide 152 new Orange Line cars to replace the existing 120-car fleet and add more frequent service.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/news_events/?id=27773&month=&year= |title=Governor Patrick Announces Major Transportation Funding Investments |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |date=22 October 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn October 22, 2014, the MassDOT Board awarded a $566.6 million contract to a [[China]] based manufacturer [[China CNR Corporation|CNR]] (which became part of [[CRRC Corporation|CRRC]] the following year) to build 152 replacement railcars for the Orange Line, as well as additional cars for the Red Line.<ref name=\"chinese\"/> The other bidders were [[Bombardier Transportation]], [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] and [[Hyundai Rotem]].

Produced and co-written by Lloyd Webber and directed by [[Joel Schumacher]], it stars [[Gerard Butler]] in the title role, [[Emmy Rossum]], [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Minnie Driver]], and [[Jennifer Ellison]].\n\nThe film was announced in 1989 but production did not start until 2002 due to Lloyd Webber's divorce and Schumacher's busy career. It was shot entirely at [[Pinewood Studios]], with scenery created with miniatures and computer graphics. Rossum, Wilson and Driver had singing experience, but Butler had none and was provided with music lessons prior to filming. ''The Phantom of the Opera'' grossed $154.6&nbsp;million worldwide and received mixed to negative reviews from critics, but was very well received by audiences. Critics praised the visuals and acting (particularly Rossum's performance) but criticized the writing and directing.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1919, a [[public auction]] is held to clear an abandoned [[opera house|opera theatre's]] vaults in Paris. [[Viscount Raoul de Chagny]], bids against the elderly [[Madame Giry]] for a [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] music box shaped like a [[barrel organ]] with the figure of a cymbal-playing [[monkey]] attached to it. The auctioneer presents a shattered [[chandelier]], relating it to \"the strange affair of the [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Phantom of the Opera]]\". As it is hoisted up to the roof, the story moves back to 1870.\n\nThe theatre prepares for the performance of the grand opera, ''Hannibal'', headed by soprano [[Carlotta (The Phantom of the Opera)|Carlotta Giudicelli]]. Theatre manager Monsieur Lef\u00e8vre plans to retire, leaving the theatre to Richard Firmin and Gilles Andr\u00e9. Carlotta refuses to perform after three years' worth of torment by the theatre's resident \"Opera Ghost\", a mysterious figure said to live in the [[catacombs]] below. Facing the performance's cancellation, Madame Giry, the ballet instructor, suggests that dancer [[Christine Daa\u00e9]], stand in as the lead actress. Christine displays her singing talents and is a huge success on opening night.\n\nChristine tells Giry's daughter, [[Meg Giry|Meg]], that she is being coached by a tutor she calls the \"Angel of Music\". Christine reunites with Raoul, a new patron of the theatre, and her childhood sweetheart, but he dismisses her secrets. That night, the masked Phantom of the Opera appears before Christine, spiriting her away to his underground lair. He confesses his love to Christine, but when she removes his mask out of curiosity, he reacts violently. She returns his mask to him, and the Phantom returns her to the theatre unharmed, but orders the managers to make her the lead in ''Il Muto''. However, the managers choose Carlotta instead.\n\nDuring the performance, the Phantom tampers with Carlotta's throat spray, causing her to sing out of tune, and Christine steps in. The Phantom encounters [[stagehand]] [[Joseph Buquet]] and hangs him above the stage. Christine and Raoul flee to the roof, where they declare their love for each other. The Phantom, eavesdropping, vows revenge.\n\nThree months later, in 1871, at a New Year [[masquerade ball]], Christine and Raoul announce their engagement. The Phantom crashes the ball and orders his own opera, ''Don Juan Triumphant'', to be performed. Upon seeing Christine's engagement ring, the Phantom steals it and flees, pursued by Raoul, but Giry stops him. Giry explains that when she was a teenager, she met the Phantom, a deformed young boy, billed as the 'Devil's Child' in a [[freak show]] and abused by the owner. When the Phantom rebelled and strangled the man to death, Giry helped him to evade the resulting mob and hid him within the opera house. The next day, Christine visits her father's tomb with the Phantom posing as his spirit to win her back, but Raoul intervenes.\n\nRaoul and the managers plot to capture the Phantom during his opera. The Phantom murders Carlotta's lover, Ubaldo Piangi, and takes his place as the male lead to sing opposite Christine. During their passionate duet, Christine unmasks the Phantom, revealing his deformities to the horrified audience. He drags her to the catacombs, bringing down the chandelier, as a [[mobbing|mob]] forms to hunt the Phantom down. Giry leads Raoul down to the catacombs to rescue Christine.\n\nThe Phantom has Christine wear a [[wedding dress]] he made for her and proposes marriage. Christine admits that she does not fear the Phantom for his appearance but for his rage and willingness to kill. Raoul arrives, the Phantom threatening to kill him unless Christine weds him. Christine, pitying the Phantom, kisses him. Moved by her kindness, the Phantom allows the lovers to flee. Finding comfort in the music box, the Phantom weeps alone, and Christine gives her ring to him in remembrance. He vanishes as the mob appears with Meg finding his discarded mask.\n\nBack in the present, Raoul visits Christine's gravestone, placing the music box before it. Before leaving, he notices a freshly laid rose with Christine's ring attached to it, implying that the Phantom is still alive and that he will always love her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik, The Phantom]]\n* [[Emmy Rossum]] as [[Christine Daa\u00e9]] \n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as [[Viscount Raoul de Chagny|Raoul de Chagny]]\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as [[Madame Giry]]\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as [[Carlotta (The Phantom of the Opera)|Carlotta Giudicelli]]\n** [[Margaret Preece]] as Carlotta's singing voice except for \"[[Learn to Be Lonely]]\"\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Gilles Andr\u00e9\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Richard Firmin\n* [[Victor McGuire]] as Ubaldo Piangi\n* [[Jennifer Ellison]] as [[Meg Giry]]\n* [[Murray Melvin]] as [[Ernest Reyer|Monsieur Reyer]]\n* [[Kevin McNally]] as [[Joseph Buquet]]\n* [[James Fleet]] as Monsieur Lef\u00e8vre\n* [[Ramin Karimloo]] as Gustave Daa\u00e9\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Warner Bros.]] purchased the [[film rights]] to ''The Phantom of the Opera'' in early 1989, granting Andrew Lloyd Webber total [[artistic control]].<ref name=preview/> Despite interest from [[A-list]] directors, Lloyd Webber and Warner Bros. instantly hired Joel Schumacher to direct; Lloyd Webber had been impressed with Schumacher's use of music in ''[[The Lost Boys]]''.<ref name=DVD/> The duo wrote the screenplay that same year,<ref name=pro/> while [[Michael Crawford]] and [[Sarah Brightman]] were cast to reprise their roles from the original stage production.

Produced and co-written by Lloyd Webber and directed by [[Joel Schumacher]], it stars [[Gerard Butler]] in the title role, [[Emmy Rossum]], [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Minnie Driver]], and [[Jennifer Ellison]].\n\nThe film was announced in 1989 but production did not start until 2002 due to Lloyd Webber's divorce and Schumacher's busy career. It was shot entirely at [[Pinewood Studios]], with scenery created with miniatures and computer graphics. Rossum, Wilson and Driver had singing experience, but Butler had none and was provided with music lessons prior to filming. ''The Phantom of the Opera'' grossed $154.6&nbsp;million worldwide and received mixed to negative reviews from critics, but was very well received by audiences. Critics praised the visuals and acting (particularly Rossum's performance) but criticized the writing and directing.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1919, a [[public auction]] is held to clear an abandoned [[opera house|opera theatre's]] vaults in Paris. [[Viscount Raoul de Chagny]], bids against the elderly [[Madame Giry]] for a [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] music box shaped like a [[barrel organ]] with the figure of a cymbal-playing [[monkey]] attached to it. The auctioneer presents a shattered [[chandelier]], relating it to \"the strange affair of the [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Phantom of the Opera]]\". As it is hoisted up to the roof, the story moves back to 1870.\n\nThe theatre prepares for the performance of the grand opera, ''Hannibal'', headed by soprano [[Carlotta (The Phantom of the Opera)|Carlotta Giudicelli]]. Theatre manager Monsieur Lef\u00e8vre plans to retire, leaving the theatre to Richard Firmin and Gilles Andr\u00e9. Carlotta refuses to perform after three years' worth of torment by the theatre's resident \"Opera Ghost\", a mysterious figure said to live in the [[catacombs]] below. Facing the performance's cancellation, Madame Giry, the ballet instructor, suggests that dancer [[Christine Daa\u00e9]], stand in as the lead actress. Christine displays her singing talents and is a huge success on opening night.\n\nChristine tells Giry's daughter, [[Meg Giry|Meg]], that she is being coached by a tutor she calls the \"Angel of Music\". Christine reunites with Raoul, a new patron of the theatre, and her childhood sweetheart, but he dismisses her secrets. That night, the masked Phantom of the Opera appears before Christine, spiriting her away to his underground lair. He confesses his love to Christine, but when she removes his mask out of curiosity, he reacts violently. She returns his mask to him, and the Phantom returns her to the theatre unharmed, but orders the managers to make her the lead in ''Il Muto''. However, the managers choose Carlotta instead.\n\nDuring the performance, the Phantom tampers with Carlotta's throat spray, causing her to sing out of tune, and Christine steps in. The Phantom encounters [[stagehand]] [[Joseph Buquet]] and hangs him above the stage. Christine and Raoul flee to the roof, where they declare their love for each other. The Phantom, eavesdropping, vows revenge.\n\nThree months later, in 1871, at a New Year [[masquerade ball]], Christine and Raoul announce their engagement. The Phantom crashes the ball and orders his own opera, ''Don Juan Triumphant'', to be performed. Upon seeing Christine's engagement ring, the Phantom steals it and flees, pursued by Raoul, but Giry stops him. Giry explains that when she was a teenager, she met the Phantom, a deformed young boy, billed as the 'Devil's Child' in a [[freak show]] and abused by the owner. When the Phantom rebelled and strangled the man to death, Giry helped him to evade the resulting mob and hid him within the opera house. The next day, Christine visits her father's tomb with the Phantom posing as his spirit to win her back, but Raoul intervenes.\n\nRaoul and the managers plot to capture the Phantom during his opera. The Phantom murders Carlotta's lover, Ubaldo Piangi, and takes his place as the male lead to sing opposite Christine. During their passionate duet, Christine unmasks the Phantom, revealing his deformities to the horrified audience. He drags her to the catacombs, bringing down the chandelier, as a [[mobbing|mob]] forms to hunt the Phantom down. Giry leads Raoul down to the catacombs to rescue Christine.\n\nThe Phantom has Christine wear a [[wedding dress]] he made for her and proposes marriage. Christine admits that she does not fear the Phantom for his appearance but for his rage and willingness to kill. Raoul arrives, the Phantom threatening to kill him unless Christine weds him. Christine, pitying the Phantom, kisses him. Moved by her kindness, the Phantom allows the lovers to flee. Finding comfort in the music box, the Phantom weeps alone, and Christine gives her ring to him in remembrance. He vanishes as the mob appears with Meg finding his discarded mask.\n\nBack in the present, Raoul visits Christine's gravestone, placing the music box before it. Before leaving, he notices a freshly laid rose with Christine's ring attached to it, implying that the Phantom is still alive and that he will always love her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik, The Phantom]]\n* [[Emmy Rossum]] as [[Christine Daa\u00e9]] \n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as [[Viscount Raoul de Chagny|Raoul de Chagny]]\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as [[Madame Giry]]\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as [[Carlotta (The Phantom of the Opera)|Carlotta Giudicelli]]\n** [[Margaret Preece]] as Carlotta's singing voice except for \"[[Learn to Be Lonely]]\"\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Gilles Andr\u00e9\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Richard Firmin\n* [[Victor McGuire]] as Ubaldo Piangi\n* [[Jennifer Ellison]] as [[Meg Giry]]\n* [[Murray Melvin]] as [[Ernest Reyer|Monsieur Reyer]]\n* [[Kevin McNally]] as [[Joseph Buquet]]\n* [[James Fleet]] as Monsieur Lef\u00e8vre\n* [[Ramin Karimloo]] as Gustave Daa\u00e9\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Warner Bros.]] purchased the [[film rights]] to ''The Phantom of the Opera'' in early 1989, granting Andrew Lloyd Webber total [[artistic control]].<ref name=preview/> Despite interest from [[A-list]] directors, Lloyd Webber and Warner Bros. instantly hired Joel Schumacher to direct; Lloyd Webber had been impressed with Schumacher's use of music in ''[[The Lost Boys]]''.<ref name=DVD/> The duo wrote the screenplay that same year,<ref name=pro/> while [[Michael Crawford]] and [[Sarah Brightman]] were cast to reprise their roles from the original stage production.

The girls forgive Jack and Annie decides to let Mr. Mitch off the hook at the insistence of Duncan.\n| LineColor       = #F7D90A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| Title           = Witch Day\n| DirectedBy      = Anne Walker Farrell\n| WrittenBy       = Ava Tramer & Eddie Quintana\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|8}}\n| ProdCode        = 1LAZ05\n| Viewers         = 1.09<ref name=\"1.04\">{{cite web|url= http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-8-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.8.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 10, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 10, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = It is Witch Day and the whole town is celebrating. Jack and Annie discover that their neighbor, Mrs. Martin, has died and steal her chili recipe with the help of Jing; having won the past ten years. Mia finds the holiday offensive as it involves burning a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 witch in celebration of Oak Dale's terrible historic past. Duncan at first pays no mind, but when he is elected the new town virgin for the holiday (the previous virgin got pregnant), he and his friends decide to steal the witch. Bex, who was a distraction, lets slip that Duncan and his friends are the culprits and drag them back for the burning. Duncan threatens everyone by reading their darkest secrets, which were to be burned with the witch, and everyone lays off. Mia admits that she likes the festivities, but that everyone should be more aware of the history. Annie, having realized what she is doing to her son, apologizes for putting his name up as a virgin and she and Jack win the chili cook off. Kimberly awaits for a boy that she likes, but accidentally scares him away.\n| LineColor       = #F7D90A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Fridgy\n| DirectedBy      = Adam Henry\n| WrittenBy       = [[John Viener]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|15}}\n| ProdCode        = 1LAZ03\n| Viewers         = 1.17<ref name=\"1.05\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-15-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.15.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 17, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = The Harrises' refrigerator finally breaks down after years of use and they head to the store to buy a new one. They are greeted by Janine who presents them with a smart fridge from ConVee. The Harrises are happy with the fridge, which they name Fridgy, as it can perform all of their tasks and chores giving them ample time to do the things they have always wanted to do. However, Annie is shocked when she realizes that Fridgy keeps a tab on many of her personal things, such as having sex with Jack on the kitchen floor, and finds herself left out of the family's personal time. When she confronts Fridgy about it, it locks the Harrises in the house. They escape, but are taken to the ConVee headquarters where Janine wants them to be the family of the future. Annie gives a speech about making an effort and the family agree with her. Janine threatens to kill them, but the Harrises have the appliances fight one another and they escape the exploding base. The family dig up their old busted refrigerator and \"enjoy\" their family time together. \n| LineColor       = #F7D90A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = Sister, Wife\n| DirectedBy      = Chuck Sheetz\n| WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Julie Thacker Scully & Amy Poehler|t=Andrew Lee|tfirst=y}}\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|22}}\n| ProdCode        = 1LAZ06\n| Viewers         = 1.07<ref name=\"1.06\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-22-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.22.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 24, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Jack and Annie decide to spend their anniversary by shopping at the home improvement store and take Kimberly with them, though they continuously fail to remember that she is with them.

The kids tell Jack and Annie that they are boring and they decide to prove them wrong by going out. After many failed excursions, they end up at an 80's themed bar, but Annie gets mad at Jack when he refuses to punch a guy that was hitting on her.

(predecessor of [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]])'s President [[Matsukata Kojiro|Kojiro Matsukata]], decided to develop shipping services so as to provide business to Kawasaki Dockyard and to serve Japan's national industrial and trade interests.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.kline.co.jp/en/corporate/profile/history/main/00/link/en%20enkaku.pdf|website=Kline.co.jp}}</ref>\n\nTo do so, he placed Kawasaki Kisen, [[Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation|Kawasaki Zosen]] and Kokusai Kisen under joint management to build a stronger fleet of 40 to 50 ships serving the Atlantic, North and South America, Africa and the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas.\n\nIn 1921, the joint name 'K Line' was adopted, based on the initial of the three companies.\n\nK Line founder, [[Matsukata Kojiro|Kojiro Matsukata]], was also known as an art collector. The [[National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo's [[Ueno Park]] was established around the core of Matsukata's private collection. In addition, the Tokyo National Museum houses his extensive collection of [[Ukiyo-e]]prints.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|website=Global.kawasaki.com|url=https://global.kawasaki.com/en/corp/history/index.html}}</ref>\n\nIn 1926, according to Lloyds, the newly established \"K\" Line reached the rank of 13th in the world, behind compatriots [[Nippon Yusen|NYK]] (9th) but ahead of [[Mitsui O.S.K. Lines|O.S.K.]] (14th).\n\nBy the end of World War II, Kawasaki Kisen had lost 56 vessels; 12 survived.\n\nPrior to World War II, the holding company [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] was part of the Kobe Kawasaki zaibatsu, which included Kawasaki Steel and Kawasaki Kisen. After the war, KHI became part of the DKB Group (keiretsu).\n\n===1945-1961===\nDuring that vital recovery period, \"K\" Line steadily returned to the building and operation of ships, reestablished bases of operation around the world, increased earnings and took other steps to restore corporate strength and vibrancy of the company.\n\n===1962-1967===\nAfter the merger with Iino Kisen, \"K\" Line was newly capitalized at \u00a59 billion and controlled a fleet of 104 ships, 55 of which were also owned by \"K\" Line. The merger gave \"K\" Line a solid foundation to advance dynamically into the future both as one of the world's largest shipping lines in terms of fleet size and as a well-balanced, integrated organization.\n\n===1971===\nK Line opens [[International Transportation Service]], a [[container terminal]] company in the [[Port of Long Beach]].\n\nThe Car Carrier transport division was inaugurated with the launch of the new [[Roll-on/roll-off]] vessel Toyota Maru No. 10.\nK-Line would thereafter enlarge the fleet up to 70 [[Roll-on/roll-off|Car carriers]] vessels.

It is the fourteenth largest container transportation and shipping company in the world.\n\n== History ==\n\n===1919-1944===\n[[image:Kline SF.jpg|thumb|right|K-line container ship steaming into [[San Francisco Bay]], June 2007]]\n\nK Line traces its origin to [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]], Ltd, which itself was born in 1878, when founder and entrepreneur [[Kawasaki Sh\u014dz\u014d]] (\u5ddd\u5d0e \u6b63\u8535) established Kawasaki Tsukiji Shipyard in Tokyo, Japan, which, eighteen years later, in 1896, was incorporated as Kawasaki Dockyard Co., Ltd.\n\nThe shipping activities were developed when Kawasaki Dockyard Co., Ltd. (predecessor of [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]])'s President [[Matsukata Kojiro|Kojiro Matsukata]], decided to develop shipping services so as to provide business to Kawasaki Dockyard and to serve Japan's national industrial and trade interests.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.kline.co.jp/en/corporate/profile/history/main/00/link/en%20enkaku.pdf|website=Kline.co.jp}}</ref>\n\nTo do so, he placed Kawasaki Kisen, [[Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation|Kawasaki Zosen]] and Kokusai Kisen under joint management to build a stronger fleet of 40 to 50 ships serving the Atlantic, North and South America, Africa and the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas.\n\nIn 1921, the joint name 'K Line' was adopted, based on the initial of the three companies.\n\nK Line founder, [[Matsukata Kojiro|Kojiro Matsukata]], was also known as an art collector. The [[National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo's [[Ueno Park]] was established around the core of Matsukata's private collection. In addition, the Tokyo National Museum houses his extensive collection of [[Ukiyo-e]]prints.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|website=Global.kawasaki.com|url=https://global.kawasaki.com/en/corp/history/index.html}}</ref>\n\nIn 1926, according to Lloyds, the newly established \"K\" Line reached the rank of 13th in the world, behind compatriots [[Nippon Yusen|NYK]] (9th) but ahead of [[Mitsui O.S.K. Lines|O.S.K.]] (14th).\n\nBy the end of World War II, Kawasaki Kisen had lost 56 vessels; 12 survived.\n\nPrior to World War II, the holding company [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] was part of the Kobe Kawasaki zaibatsu, which included Kawasaki Steel and Kawasaki Kisen. After the war, KHI became part of the DKB Group (keiretsu).\n\n===1945-1961===\nDuring that vital recovery period, \"K\" Line steadily returned to the building and operation of ships, reestablished bases of operation around the world, increased earnings and took other steps to restore corporate strength and vibrancy of the company.\n\n===1962-1967===\nAfter the merger with Iino Kisen, \"K\" Line was newly capitalized at \u00a59 billion and controlled a fleet of 104 ships, 55 of which were also owned by \"K\" Line. The merger gave \"K\" Line a solid foundation to advance dynamically into the future both as one of the world's largest shipping lines in terms of fleet size and as a well-balanced, integrated organization.\n\n===1971===\nK Line opens [[International Transportation Service]], a [[container terminal]] company in the [[Port of Long Beach]].\n\nThe Car Carrier transport division was inaugurated with the launch of the new [[Roll-on/roll-off]] vessel Toyota Maru No. 10.\nK-Line would thereafter enlarge the fleet up to 70 [[Roll-on/roll-off|Car carriers]] vessels.
