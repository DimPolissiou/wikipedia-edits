Contemporary use of the coordinate system is presented with the choice of interpreting the system either as [[sidereal astrology|sidereal]], with the signs fixed to the [[Fixed stars|stellar background]], or as [[tropical astrology|tropical]], with the signs fixed to the point ([[Euclidean vector|vector]] of the Sun) at the [[March equinox]].<ref>Rochberg, Francesca (1998), \"Babylonian Horoscopes\", ''American Philosophical Society'', New Series, Vol. 88, No. 1, pp i-164</ref>\n\n[[Western astrology]] takes the tropical approach, whereas [[Hindu astrology]] takes the sidereal one. This results in the originally unified zodiacal coordinate system drifting apart gradually, with a clockwise (westward) precession of 1.4 degrees per century.\n\nFor the tropical zodiac used in Western astronomy and astrology, this means that the tropical ''sign'' of Aries currently lies somewhere within the ''constellation'' Pisces (\"[[Age of Pisces]]\").\n\nThe sidereal coordinate system takes into account the [[ayanamsa]], ''ayan'' meaning ''transit'' or ''movement'', and ''amsa'' meaning ''small part'', i.e. movement of equinoxes in small parts. It is unclear when Indians became aware of the precession of the equinoxes, but [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bhaskara 2]]'s 12th-century treatise ''[[Siddhanta Shiromani]]'' gives equations for measurement of precession of equinoxes, and says his equations are based on some lost equations of ''[[Suryasiddhanta]]'' plus the equation of Munjaala.\n\nThe discovery of precession is attributed to [[Hipparchus]] around 130 BC. [[Ptolemy]] quotes from Hipparchus' now lost work entitled \"On the Displacement of the Solstitial and Equinoctial Points\" in the seventh book of his 2nd century astronomical text, ''[[Almagest]]'', where he describes the phenomenon of precession and estimates its value.<ref name=\"Springer\"/> Ptolemy clarified that the convention of Greek mathematical astronomy was to commence the zodiac from the point of the vernal equinox and to always refer to this point as \"the first degree\" of Aries.<ref name=Geminos2>{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=James|last2=Berggren|first2=J. Lennart|title=Geminos's Introduction to the Phenomena|date=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=069112339X|page=115}}</ref> This is known as the \"tropical zodiac\" (from the Greek word tr\u00f3pos, turn)<ref>{{cite web|title=tropo-|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tropo-|website=Dictionary.com|publisher=Random House, Inc.|accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref> because its starting point revolves through the circle of background constellations over time.\n\nThe principle of the vernal point acting as the first degree of the zodiac for Greek astronomers is also described in the 1st century BC astronomical text of [[Geminus]] of Rhodes. Geminus explains that Greek astronomers of his era associate the first degrees of the zodiac signs with the two solstices and the two equinoxes, in contrast to the older Chaldean (Babylonian) system, which placed these points within the zodiac signs.<ref name=Geminos2/> This illustrates that Ptolemy merely clarified the convention of Greek astronomers and did not originate the principle of the tropical zodiac, as is sometimes assumed.\n\nPtolemy also demonstrates that the principle of the tropical zodiac was well known to his predecessors within his astrological text, the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', where he explains why it would be an error to associate the regularly spaced signs of the seasonally aligned zodiac with the irregular boundaries of the visible constellations:\n\n::The beginnings of the signs, and likewise those of the terms, are to be taken from the equinoctial and tropical points. This rule is not only clearly stated by writers on the subject, but is also especially evident by the demonstration constantly afforded, that their natures, influences and familiarities have no other origin than from the tropics and equinoxes, as has been already plainly shown. And, if other beginnings were allowed, it would either be necessary to exclude the natures of the signs from the theory of prognostication, or impossible to avoid error in then retaining and making use of them; as the regularity of their spaces and distances, upon which their influence depends, would then be invaded and broken in upon.<ref name=\"Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos\"/>\n\n== In modern astronomy ==\n\nAstronomically, the zodiac defines a belt of space extending 9\u00b0 either side of the [[ecliptic]], within which the orbits of the Moon and the principal planets remain.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">{{cite web|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Zodiac|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/657680/zodiac|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref> It is a feature of a [[celestial coordinate system]] centered upon the [[ecliptic]], (the plane of the Earth's orbit and the Sun's apparent path), by which [[celestial longitude]] is measured in degrees east of the [[vernal equinox]] (the ascending intersection of the ecliptic and [[equator]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Ecliptic|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/178159/ecliptic|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref> Stars within the zodiac are subject to [[occultation]]s by the Moon and other solar system bodies.

Thus, signs are spoken of as \"long\" or \"short\" ascension.<ref>Julia Parker \"The Astrologer's Handbook\", pp 10, Alva Press, NJ, 2010</ref>\n\n== Precession of the equinoxes ==\n{{Further|Axial precession|Epoch (astronomy)|Sidereal and tropical astrology|Astrological age|Ayanamsa}}\n[[File:Equinox path.png|thumb|300px|Path taken by the point of [[vernal equinox]] along the ecliptic over the past 6,000 years]]\n\nThe zodiac system was developed in [[Neo-Babylonian|Babylonia]], some 2,500 years ago, during the \"[[Age of Aries]]\".<ref>Sachs, Abraham (1948), \"A Classification of the Babylonian Astronomical Tablets of the Seleucid Period\", ''Journal of Cuneiform Studies'', Vol. 2, No. 4, pp.&nbsp;271\u2013290</ref> At the time, it is assumed, the [[precession of the equinoxes]] was unknown. Contemporary use of the coordinate system is presented with the choice of interpreting the system either as [[sidereal astrology|sidereal]], with the signs fixed to the [[Fixed stars|stellar background]], or as [[tropical astrology|tropical]], with the signs fixed to the point ([[Euclidean vector|vector]] of the Sun) at the [[March equinox]].<ref>Rochberg, Francesca (1998), \"Babylonian Horoscopes\", ''American Philosophical Society'', New Series, Vol. 88, No. 1, pp i-164</ref>\n\n[[Western astrology]] takes the tropical approach, whereas [[Hindu astrology]] takes the sidereal one. This results in the originally unified zodiacal coordinate system drifting apart gradually, with a clockwise (westward) precession of 1.4 degrees per century.\n\nFor the tropical zodiac used in Western astronomy and astrology, this means that the tropical ''sign'' of Aries currently lies somewhere within the ''constellation'' Pisces (\"[[Age of Pisces]]\").\n\nThe sidereal coordinate system takes into account the [[ayanamsa]], ''ayan'' meaning ''transit'' or ''movement'', and ''amsa'' meaning ''small part'', i.e. movement of equinoxes in small parts. It is unclear when Indians became aware of the precession of the equinoxes, but [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bhaskara 2]]'s 12th-century treatise ''[[Siddhanta Shiromani]]'' gives equations for measurement of precession of equinoxes, and says his equations are based on some lost equations of ''[[Suryasiddhanta]]'' plus the equation of Munjaala.\n\nThe discovery of precession is attributed to [[Hipparchus]] around 130 BC. [[Ptolemy]] quotes from Hipparchus' now lost work entitled \"On the Displacement of the Solstitial and Equinoctial Points\" in the seventh book of his 2nd century astronomical text, ''[[Almagest]]'', where he describes the phenomenon of precession and estimates its value.<ref name=\"Springer\"/> Ptolemy clarified that the convention of Greek mathematical astronomy was to commence the zodiac from the point of the vernal equinox and to always refer to this point as \"the first degree\" of Aries.<ref name=Geminos2>{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=James|last2=Berggren|first2=J. Lennart|title=Geminos's Introduction to the Phenomena|date=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=069112339X|page=115}}</ref> This is known as the \"tropical zodiac\" (from the Greek word tr\u00f3pos, turn)<ref>{{cite web|title=tropo-|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tropo-|website=Dictionary.com|publisher=Random House, Inc.|accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref> because its starting point revolves through the circle of background constellations over time.\n\nThe principle of the vernal point acting as the first degree of the zodiac for Greek astronomers is also described in the 1st century BC astronomical text of [[Geminus]] of Rhodes. Geminus explains that Greek astronomers of his era associate the first degrees of the zodiac signs with the two solstices and the two equinoxes, in contrast to the older Chaldean (Babylonian) system, which placed these points within the zodiac signs.<ref name=Geminos2/> This illustrates that Ptolemy merely clarified the convention of Greek astronomers and did not originate the principle of the tropical zodiac, as is sometimes assumed.\n\nPtolemy also demonstrates that the principle of the tropical zodiac was well known to his predecessors within his astrological text, the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', where he explains why it would be an error to associate the regularly spaced signs of the seasonally aligned zodiac with the irregular boundaries of the visible constellations:\n\n::The beginnings of the signs, and likewise those of the terms, are to be taken from the equinoctial and tropical points. This rule is not only clearly stated by writers on the subject, but is also especially evident by the demonstration constantly afforded, that their natures, influences and familiarities have no other origin than from the tropics and equinoxes, as has been already plainly shown. And, if other beginnings were allowed, it would either be necessary to exclude the natures of the signs from the theory of prognostication, or impossible to avoid error in then retaining and making use of them; as the regularity of their spaces and distances, upon which their influence depends, would then be invaded and broken in upon.<ref name=\"Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos\"/>\n\n== In modern astronomy ==\n\nAstronomically, the zodiac defines a belt of space extending 9\u00b0 either side of the [[ecliptic]], within which the orbits of the Moon and the principal planets remain.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">{{cite web|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Zodiac|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/657680/zodiac|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref> It is a feature of a [[celestial coordinate system]] centered upon the [[ecliptic]], (the plane of the Earth's orbit and the Sun's apparent path), by which [[celestial longitude]] is measured in degrees east of the [[vernal equinox]] (the ascending intersection of the ecliptic and [[equator]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Ecliptic|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/178159/ecliptic|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref> Stars within the zodiac are subject to [[occultation]]s by the Moon and other solar system bodies.

The first 30\u00b0 along the ecliptic is nominally designated as the zodiac sign Aries, which no longer falls within the proximity of the constellation Aries since the effect of [[precession]] is to move the vernal point through the backdrop of visible constellations (it is currently located near the end of the constellation Pisces, having been within that constellation since the 2nd century AD).<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{cite web|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Astronomical map|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/40018/astronomical-map/52787/The-ecliptic-system|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref> The subsequent 30\u00b0 of the ecliptic is nominally designated the zodiac sign Taurus, and so on through the twelve signs of the zodiac so that each occupies 1/12th (30\u00b0) of the zodiac's great circle. Zodiac signs have never been used to determine the boundaries of astronomical constellations that lie in the vicinity of the zodiac, which are, and always have been, irregular in their size and shape.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\"/>\n\nThe convention of measuring celestial longitude within individual signs was still being used in the mid-19th century,<ref>{{cite book|author=G.
