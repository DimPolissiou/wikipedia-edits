When Archbishop of Chihuahua [[Adalberto Almeida y Merino]] denounced electoral fraud in the 1986 gubernatorial elections, he announced the closing of churches in the diocese on July 20. Prigione moved to avert a replay of the Church-State conflict of the late 1920s.<ref>Vikram K. Chand, ''Mexico's Political Awakening''. Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press 2001, p. 183.</ref>\n\nWhen Prigione arrived in Mexico the Holy See and the Mexican government did not have diplomatic relations and the Church functioned in the country only because the government chose not to enforce much of its anti-religious law. Prigione was a key player in the change in attitude and policy of the Mexican government toward the Catholic Church. He was engaged in secret talks with the government in the month before the inauguration of President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in December 1988.
