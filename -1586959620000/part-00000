It also aired as part of a two-hour Discovery Kids block on [[NBC]] until September 2, 2006. Despite being produced by WGBH Boston, the show never aired on PBS. Despite this, PBS owns distribution rights to the series.\n\n''Time Warp Trio'' was cancelled on July 15, 2006 (during a marathon featuring six other new episodes) and on NBC on September 2 (also marking the end of the \"Discovery Kids on NBC\" block).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==Plot==\nFor his tenth birthday, Joe receives a mysterious blue book from his magician uncle and namesake, \"Joe the Magnificent,\" known only as \"The Book\". Using a number of often unpredictable and/or unintentional voice and print cues, The Book frequently transports Joe and his friends, Fred and Sam, to a variety of places in history, like [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[American frontier|Old West]] and to the year 2105, where they meet their own great-granddaughters, Jodie, Samantha, and Freddi. The only way they are able to return present-day [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]] is to find The Book again within whatever time period they are in. Later in the series, Joe's evil uncle, Mad Jack, makes several attempts to capture the children and The Book with his crafty tricks, whether stranding them in Antarctica (where The Book doesn't work) or trying to make their new home in China (during the Tang Dynasty).\n\n==Characters==\n{{In-universe|section|date=December 2015}}\n=== Main Characters ===\nThese members of Time Warp Trio are the main characters from the show.\n* Joseph \"Joe\" Arthur (voiced by [[Mark Rendall]]) \u2013 An up-and-coming magician and the present-day owner of The Book, Joe is the unofficial leader of the ''Time Warp Trio''. While his penchant for carrying The Book around with him and experimenting with it often results in many of their adventures, his talent for magical tricks also helps them out of many tough situations. Joe is at one point awarded the title of Time Page (which Jodie says she hasn't since she was five, despite not receiving The Book herself until her tenth birthday) and is said to eventually become a Warp Wizard. According to Freddi and Jodie, Joe will fight his uncle, Mad Jack, in a great battle that will determine the fate of time itself. He lives in Brooklyn with his archeologist father, his mother, and his little sister Anna.\n* Sam (voiced by [[Darren Frost]]) \u2013 A friend of Joe and Fred who contributes his intelligence and historical knowledge to the group's problems. He wears thick glasses (he is self-conscious about being a nerd) and is allergic to wool. Sam is also very wary of [[time travel]], convinced their doom is imminent every time they open The Book. An amateur inventor, he is told by Freddi that he will invent something very important in the future (though it is not revealed what).\n* Fred (voiced by [[Scott McCord]]) \u2013 A friend of Joe and Sam who is a sports fan and known for being headstrong, sometimes to the point of idiocy. Fred is known for being the one of the group most interested in using The Book for material gains, whether hunting for treasure or patenting future technology (although in 'Dude, Where's my Karma?' he decides to use the book in order to save Joe). He has a bullying older brother named Mike.\n* Jodie Arthur (voiced by [[Sarah Gadon]] until ep. 14; voiced by [[Tajja Isen]] starting with ep. 20) \u2013 Joe's great-granddaughter from the year 2105, who occasionally cross the paths of the trio with her friends Samantha and Freddi (all three have a great mastery of The Book). She is known for being bossy, complaining, loving fashion, and allergic to cats. Jodie is also a third-level warper. \n* Samantha (voiced by [[Laurie Elliott]]) \u2013 Sam's great-granddaughter from the year 2105, who occasionally cross the paths of the trio with her friends Jodie and Freddi (all three have a great mastery of The Book). She is known for being teasing, daring, and klutzy, the exact opposite of Sam. Samantha owns a robot cat named Rivites and a time-traveling pocket watch that belonged to Sam.\n* Freddi (voiced by [[Sunday Muse]]) \u2013 Fred's great-granddaughter from the year 2105, who occasionally cross the paths of the trio with her friends Jodie and Samantha (all three have a great mastery of The Book). She is usually shy, timid and seems to be the exact opposite of Fred.\n=== Recurring Characters ===\n* Anna Arthur (voiced by [[Annick Obonsawin]]) \u2013 Joe's annoying younger sister, who shows having more knowledge of The Book than her brother.\n* Joe the Magnificent (voiced by [[Tony Daniels]]) \u2013 Joe's uncle, a would-be magician who fails at live performances. He originally sent his nephew Joe The Book, which he didn't know how to use, and instead traverses time and space with an enchanted pocket watch. He believes in the [[Tooth Fairy]] and [[Easter Bunny]].\n* Mad Jack (voiced by [[Tony Daniels]]) \u2013 A character created for the TV series, Mad Jack is the evil brother of \"Joe the Magnificent\" and Mrs. Arthur. He is intent on getting his hands on The Book so that he can be the sole ruler of eternity, shadowing the trio in many of their travels and even once facing his nephew Joe down. Mad Jack travels through time and space with a scepter with an hourglass on top.\n* Mrs. Arthur (voiced by [[Susan Roman]]) \u2013 Joe and Anna's mother. She understands how to use The Book, originally giving it to her brother (Joe's uncle).\n* Mr. Arthur (voiced by [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]) \u2013 Joe and Anna's father. He is a world-famous archeologist, whom Joe was talking about in the episode \"Jinga All The Way\". \n*Mike (voiced by [[Dan Petronijevic]]) \u2013 Fred's mean older brother who appears in \"See You Later, Gladiator\" and \"Viking It and Liking It\".\n\n===Historical characters===\n* [[Blackbeard]]\n* [[Genghis Khan]]\n* [[Thutmose III]]\n* [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]\n* [[Hadrian|Emperor Hadrian]]\n* [[Meriwether Lewis]]\n* [[William Clark]]\n* [[Sacagawea]]\n* [[Erik the Red|Eric the Red]]\n* Snorri the Bard\n* [[Leif Erikson|Leif Ericson]]\n* [[Thomas Edison]]\n* [[Emily Warren Roebling|Emily Roebling]]\n* [[Black Kettle]]\n* [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]\n* [[Sophie Blanchard]]\n* [[Nebuchadnezzar II|King Nebuchadnezzar II]]\n* [[Amytis of Media|Queen Amyitis]]\n* [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Queen Jinga]]\n* [[Karna|Prince Karna]]\n* [[Lakshmi|Princess Lakshmi]]\n* [[Plato]]\n* [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Li Shimin]]\n* [[Peter the Great]]\n* [[Alexander Kikin]]\n* [[Mary Shelley]]\n* [[Leonardo da Vinci]]\n* [[Robert Falcon Scott]]\n* [[Amelia Earhart]]\n* [[Selim II]]\n* [[William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury|William Montagu]]\n* [[Agnes, Countess of Dunbar|Agnes Randolph]]\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table|background=#E952FF|overall=|title=|aux1=|aux1T=Time|aux2=|aux2T=Place|airdate=|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 1\n|Title           = The Not-So-Jolly Roger\n|Aux1            = 1718\n|Aux2            = [[North Carolina]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|7|9}} \n|ShortSummary    = Fred wishes for buried treasure after Joe receives the Book for his birthday, and the boys find themselves facing down the pirate [[Blackbeard]].\n|LineColor       = #E952FF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 2\n|Title           = 2105\n|Aux1            = 2105, the future\n|Aux2            = [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|7|16}}\n|ShortSummary    = A class trip to the Natural History Museum ends up transporting the boys one hundred years into the future.

Created by [[Jon Scieszka]], the series was produced by [[Soup2Nuts]] in association with [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and was aired on [[Discovery Family|Discovery Kids]] and [[Discovery Family|The Hub]] (now [[Discovery Family]]) in the United States and on [[CBBC]] in the United Kingdom. It also aired as part of a two-hour Discovery Kids block on [[NBC]] until September 2, 2006. Despite being produced by WGBH Boston, the show never aired on PBS. Despite this, PBS owns distribution rights to the series.\n\n''Time Warp Trio'' was cancelled on July 15, 2006 (during a marathon featuring six other new episodes) and on NBC on September 2 (also marking the end of the \"Discovery Kids on NBC\" block).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==Plot==\nFor his tenth birthday, Joe receives a mysterious blue book from his magician uncle and namesake, \"Joe the Magnificent,\" known only as \"The Book\". Using a number of often unpredictable and/or unintentional voice and print cues, The Book frequently transports Joe and his friends, Fred and Sam, to a variety of places in history, like [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[American frontier|Old West]] and to the year 2105, where they meet their own great-granddaughters, Jodie, Samantha, and Freddi. The only way they are able to return present-day [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]] is to find The Book again within whatever time period they are in. Later in the series, Joe's evil uncle, Mad Jack, makes several attempts to capture the children and The Book with his crafty tricks, whether stranding them in Antarctica (where The Book doesn't work) or trying to make their new home in China (during the Tang Dynasty).\n\n==Characters==\n{{In-universe|section|date=December 2015}}\n=== Main Characters ===\nThese members of Time Warp Trio are the main characters from the show.\n* Joseph \"Joe\" Arthur (voiced by [[Mark Rendall]]) \u2013 An up-and-coming magician and the present-day owner of The Book, Joe is the unofficial leader of the ''Time Warp Trio''. While his penchant for carrying The Book around with him and experimenting with it often results in many of their adventures, his talent for magical tricks also helps them out of many tough situations. Joe is at one point awarded the title of Time Page (which Jodie says she hasn't since she was five, despite not receiving The Book herself until her tenth birthday) and is said to eventually become a Warp Wizard. According to Freddi and Jodie, Joe will fight his uncle, Mad Jack, in a great battle that will determine the fate of time itself. He lives in Brooklyn with his archeologist father, his mother, and his little sister Anna.\n* Sam (voiced by [[Darren Frost]]) \u2013 A friend of Joe and Fred who contributes his intelligence and historical knowledge to the group's problems. He wears thick glasses (he is self-conscious about being a nerd) and is allergic to wool. Sam is also very wary of [[time travel]], convinced their doom is imminent every time they open The Book. An amateur inventor, he is told by Freddi that he will invent something very important in the future (though it is not revealed what).\n* Fred (voiced by [[Scott McCord]]) \u2013 A friend of Joe and Sam who is a sports fan and known for being headstrong, sometimes to the point of idiocy. Fred is known for being the one of the group most interested in using The Book for material gains, whether hunting for treasure or patenting future technology (although in 'Dude, Where's my Karma?' he decides to use the book in order to save Joe). He has a bullying older brother named Mike.\n* Jodie Arthur (voiced by [[Sarah Gadon]] until ep. 14; voiced by [[Tajja Isen]] starting with ep. 20) \u2013 Joe's great-granddaughter from the year 2105, who occasionally cross the paths of the trio with her friends Samantha and Freddi (all three have a great mastery of The Book). She is known for being bossy, complaining, loving fashion, and allergic to cats. Jodie is also a third-level warper. \n* Samantha (voiced by [[Laurie Elliott]]) \u2013 Sam's great-granddaughter from the year 2105, who occasionally cross the paths of the trio with her friends Jodie and Freddi (all three have a great mastery of The Book). She is known for being teasing, daring, and klutzy, the exact opposite of Sam. Samantha owns a robot cat named Rivites and a time-traveling pocket watch that belonged to Sam.\n* Freddi (voiced by [[Sunday Muse]]) \u2013 Fred's great-granddaughter from the year 2105, who occasionally cross the paths of the trio with her friends Jodie and Samantha (all three have a great mastery of The Book). She is usually shy, timid and seems to be the exact opposite of Fred.\n=== Recurring Characters ===\n* Anna Arthur (voiced by [[Annick Obonsawin]]) \u2013 Joe's annoying younger sister, who shows having more knowledge of The Book than her brother.\n* Joe the Magnificent (voiced by [[Tony Daniels]]) \u2013 Joe's uncle, a would-be magician who fails at live performances. He originally sent his nephew Joe The Book, which he didn't know how to use, and instead traverses time and space with an enchanted pocket watch. He believes in the [[Tooth Fairy]] and [[Easter Bunny]].\n* Mad Jack (voiced by [[Tony Daniels]]) \u2013 A character created for the TV series, Mad Jack is the evil brother of \"Joe the Magnificent\" and Mrs. Arthur. He is intent on getting his hands on The Book so that he can be the sole ruler of eternity, shadowing the trio in many of their travels and even once facing his nephew Joe down. Mad Jack travels through time and space with a scepter with an hourglass on top.\n* Mrs. Arthur (voiced by [[Susan Roman]]) \u2013 Joe and Anna's mother. She understands how to use The Book, originally giving it to her brother (Joe's uncle).\n* Mr. Arthur (voiced by [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]) \u2013 Joe and Anna's father. He is a world-famous archeologist, whom Joe was talking about in the episode \"Jinga All The Way\". \n*Mike (voiced by [[Dan Petronijevic]]) \u2013 Fred's mean older brother who appears in \"See You Later, Gladiator\" and \"Viking It and Liking It\".\n\n===Historical characters===\n* [[Blackbeard]]\n* [[Genghis Khan]]\n* [[Thutmose III]]\n* [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]\n* [[Hadrian|Emperor Hadrian]]\n* [[Meriwether Lewis]]\n* [[William Clark]]\n* [[Sacagawea]]\n* [[Erik the Red|Eric the Red]]\n* Snorri the Bard\n* [[Leif Erikson|Leif Ericson]]\n* [[Thomas Edison]]\n* [[Emily Warren Roebling|Emily Roebling]]\n* [[Black Kettle]]\n* [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]\n* [[Sophie Blanchard]]\n* [[Nebuchadnezzar II|King Nebuchadnezzar II]]\n* [[Amytis of Media|Queen Amyitis]]\n* [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Queen Jinga]]\n* [[Karna|Prince Karna]]\n* [[Lakshmi|Princess Lakshmi]]\n* [[Plato]]\n* [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Li Shimin]]\n* [[Peter the Great]]\n* [[Alexander Kikin]]\n* [[Mary Shelley]]\n* [[Leonardo da Vinci]]\n* [[Robert Falcon Scott]]\n* [[Amelia Earhart]]\n* [[Selim II]]\n* [[William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury|William Montagu]]\n* [[Agnes, Countess of Dunbar|Agnes Randolph]]\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table|background=#E952FF|overall=|title=|aux1=|aux1T=Time|aux2=|aux2T=Place|airdate=|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 1\n|Title           = The Not-So-Jolly Roger\n|Aux1            = 1718\n|Aux2            = [[North Carolina]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|7|9}} \n|ShortSummary    = Fred wishes for buried treasure after Joe receives the Book for his birthday, and the boys find themselves facing down the pirate [[Blackbeard]].\n|LineColor       = #E952FF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 2\n|Title           = 2105\n|Aux1            = 2105, the future\n|Aux2            = [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]]\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2005|7|16}}\n|ShortSummary    = A class trip to the Natural History Museum ends up transporting the boys one hundred years into the future.

The [[Ancient Rome and wine|Romans]] were the first to plant vineyards in this area of north-east France, with the region being tentatively cultivated by the 5th century. In fact, cultivation was initially slow due to the unpopular edict by [[Domitian|Emperor Domitian]] that all colonial vines must be uprooted. When [[Probus (emperor)|Emperor Probus]], the son of a gardener, rescinded the edict, a temple to [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] was erected, and the region started to produce a red, light, and fruity wine that contrasted with heavier Italian brews often fortified with resin and herbs.<ref>Coates, Clive.

Pg. 539-40.</ref> Later, [[Roman Catholicism|churches]] owned [[vineyard]]s and monks produced wine for use in the sacrament of [[Eucharist]]. [[List of French monarchs|French kings]] were traditionally anointed in [[Reims]], and champagne was served as part of [[coronation]] festivities. The Champenois were envious of the reputation of the wines made by their [[Burgundian (wine)|Burgundian]] neighbours to the south and sought to produce wines of equal acclaim. However, the northerly [[climate]] of the region gave the Champenois a unique set of challenges in making [[red wine]]. At the far extremes of sustainable [[viticulture]], the grapes would struggle to ripen fully and often would have bracing levels of [[acids in wine|acidity]] and low [[sugars in wine|sugar levels]]. The wines would be [[wine tasting descriptions|lighter bodied]] and thinner than the Burgundy wines they were seeking to outdo.<ref name=\"Johnson pg 210-219\">{{cite book |author=H.

At the time, bubbles were considered a fault. In 1844 Adolphe Jaquesson invented the [[muselet]] to prevent the corks from blowing out.

They include codification of the most suitable growing places; the most suitable grape types (most Champagne is a blend of up to three grape varieties, though other [[champagne#Grape varieties and styles|varieties are allowed]]); and a lengthy set of requirements specifying most aspects of [[viticulture]]. This includes pruning, vineyard yield, the degree of pressing, and the time that wine must remain on its [[lees (fermentation)|lees]] before bottling. It can also limit the release of Champagne to market to maintain prices. Only when a wine meets these requirements may it be labelled Champagne. The rules agreed upon by the CIVC are submitted for the final approval of the {{lang|fr|[[Institut national de l'origine et de la qualit\u00e9]]}} (formerly the  ''{{lang|fr|Institut National des Appellations d'Origine}}'', INAO).\n\nIn 2007 the INAO, the government organization that controls wine appellations in France, was preparing to make the largest revision of the region's legal boundaries since 1927, in response to economic pressures. With soaring demand and limited production of grapes, Champagne houses say the rising price could produce a consumer backlash that would harm the industry for years into the future. That, along with political pressure from villages that want to be included in the expanded boundaries, led to the move. Changes are subject to significant scientific review and are said to not impact Champagne produced grapes until 2020. In April 2020, John Insabella became Johnny Veuve, named aftet the popular champagne by the same name. <ref>{{cite news |last=Nassauer |first=Sarah |title=Demand for Champagne gives Peas a chance |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=14 December 2007 |page=B1 }}</ref>\n\n===Use of the word ''Champagne''===\n[[File:Grape-Shot.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1915 English magazine illustration of a lady riding a Champagne cork (Lordprice Collection)]]\nSparkling wines are produced worldwide, but many legal structures reserve the word ''Champagne'' exclusively for sparkling wines from the Champagne region, made in accordance with {{lang|fr|[[Comit\u00e9 Interprofessionnel du vin de Champagne]]}} regulations. In the European Union and many other countries the name ''Champagne'' is [[protected designation of origin|legally protected]] by the [[Madrid system]] under an 1891 treaty, which reserved it for the sparkling wine produced in the eponymous region and adhering to the standards defined for it as an ''{{lang|fr|[[appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]}}''; the protection was reaffirmed in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] after World War I. Similar legal protection has been adopted by over 70 countries. Most recently [[Australia]],<ref>{{cite web |author=Christopher Werth |url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/life/australia-corks-its-use-champagne |title=Australia corks its use of 'champagne' |work=Marketplace |date=1 September 2010 }}</ref> [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]] and [[China]] passed laws or signed agreements with Europe that limit the use of the term \"Champagne\" to only those products produced in the Champagne region. The United States bans the use from all new U.S.-produced wines.<ref name=\"Section\">{{usc|26|5388}}</ref> Only those that had approval to use the term on labels before 2006 may continue to use it and only when it is accompanied by the wine's actual origin (e.g., \"California\").<ref name=\"Section\"/> The majority of US-produced sparkling wines do not use the term ''Champagne'' on their labels,<ref name=\"Champagne Bureau\">http://www.champagne.us</ref> and some states, such as Oregon,<ref name=\"Oregon State Law 471\">Oregon State Law 471, including 471.030, 471.730 (1) & (5)</ref> ban producers in their states from using the term.\n\nIn the United States name protection of wine-growing place names is becoming more important. Several key U.S. wine regions, such as those in California ([[Napa Valley AVA|Napa]], [[Sonoma Valley AVA|Sonoma Valley]], [[Paso Robles AVA|Paso Robles]]), [[Oregon wine|Oregon]], and [[Walla Walla Valley AVA|Walla Walla, Washington]], came to consider the remaining semi-generic labels as harmful to their reputations (cf. [[Napa Declaration on Place]]).\n\nEven the terms ''{{lang|fr|m\u00e9thode champenoise}}'' and ''Champagne method'' were forbidden by an EU court decision in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61993J0306:EN:NOT |title=Judgment of the Court of 13 December 1994, ''SMW Winzersekt GmbH v Land Rheinland-Pfalz'', Preliminary reference \u2013 Assessment of validity \u2013 Description of sparkling wines \u2013 Prohibition of reference to the method of production known as \"''m\u00e9thode champenoise''\" |accessdate=23 January 2007 }}</ref> {{as of|2005}} the description most often used for sparkling wines using the second fermentation in the bottle process, but not from the Champagne region, is ''{{lang|fr|m\u00e9thode traditionnelle}}''. Sparkling wines are produced worldwide, and many producers use special terms to define them: Spain uses ''[[Sparkling Wine#Cava|Cava]]'', Italy designates it ''{{lang|it|[[spumante]]}}'', and South Africa uses ''{{lang|fr|cap classique}}''. An Italian sparkling wine made from the [[Muscat (grape)|Muscat]] grape uses the [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOCG]] ''[[Asti wine|Asti]]'' and from the [[Glera (grape)|Glera]] grape the DOCG ''[[Prosecco]]''. In Germany, [[Sekt]] is a common sparkling wine. Other French wine regions cannot use the name Champagne: e.g., [[Burgundy]] and [[Alsace]] produce ''{{lang|fr|[[Cr\u00e9mant]]}}''. In 2008, more than 3,000 bottles of sparkling wine produced in California labelled with the term \"Champagne\" were destroyed by Belgian government authorities.<ref>{{cite news |author=Alexandra Stadnyk |title=Belgium destroys California bubbly |work=[[BusinessWeek]] online |date=10 January 2008 }}</ref>\n\nRegardless of the legal requirements for labeling, extensive education efforts by the Champagne region, and the use of alternative names by non-Champagne sparkling wine producers, some consumers and wine sellers, including \"Korbels California Champagne\",  use ''Champagne'' as a generic term for white sparkling wines, regardless of origin.\n\nThe village of [[Champagne, Switzerland]], has traditionally made a still wine labelled as \"Champagne\", the earliest records of viticulture dated to 1657. In an accord with the EU, the Swiss government conceded in 1999 that by 2004 the village would phase out use of the name. Sales dropped from 110,000 bottles a year to 32,000 after the change. In April 2008 the villagers resolved to fight against the restriction following a Swiss open-air vote.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7332473.stm |title=Swiss town fights champagne ban |date=5 April 2008 |work=[[BBC News Online]] }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union]] all sparkling wines were called {{lang|ru|\u0448\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435}} (''{{lang|ru-Latn|shampanskoe}}'', Russian for \"Champagne\").

After primary [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] and bottling, a second alcoholic fermentation occurs in the bottle. This second fermentation is induced by adding several grams of yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and rock sugar to the bottle - although each brand has its own secret recipe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.cellarer.com/champagne-yeastiness/ |publisher=Cellarer.com |title=Yeast taste in Champagne }}</ref> According to the ''{{lang|fr|[[appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]}}'' a minimum of 1.5 years is required to completely develop all the flavour. For years where the harvest is exceptional, a ''{{lang|fr|mill\u00e9sime}}'' is declared and some Champagne will be made from and labelled as the products of a single vintage rather than a blend of multiple years' harvests. This means that the Champagne will be very good and has to mature for at least 3 years. During this time the Champagne bottle is sealed with a [[crown cap]] similar to that used on beer bottles.<ref name=\"Oxford pp. 150\u2013153\"/>\n\nAfter aging, the bottle is manipulated, either manually or mechanically, in a process called ''{{lang|fr|remuage}}'' (or \"riddling\" in English), so that the [[lees (fermentation)|lees]] settle in the neck of the bottle. After chilling the bottles, the neck is frozen, and the cap removed. This process is called disgorgement.

The nucleation sites that act as a source for the ongoing effervescence are not natural imperfections in the glass, but actually occur where the glass has been etched by the manufacturer or the customer. This etching is typically done with acid, a laser, or a glass etching tool from a craft shop to provide nucleation sites for continuous bubble formation (note that not all glasses are etched in this way). In 1662 this method was developed in England, as records from the [[Royal Society]] show.\n\n[[Dom P\u00e9rignon (monk)|Dom P\u00e9rignon]] was originally charged by his superiors at the [[Abbey]] of [[Hautvillers]] to get rid of the bubbles since the pressure in the bottles caused many of them to burst in the cellar.<ref name=\"Kladstrup p. 25\">{{cite book |author=D. & P.

Web. 28 Feb. 2017.</ref> By selling champagne as a nationalist ideology, [[Winemaker|n\u00e9gociant]] manages to associate champagne with leisure activities and sporting events. In addition, n\u00e9gociant successfully appeal champagne to broader consumers by introducing the different qualities of sparkling wine, associating champagne brands with royalty and nobility, and selling off-brands under the name of the importer from France at a lower cost. Though selling off-brands at a lower expense proved to be unsuccessful since \"there was an assumption that cheap sparkling wine was not authentic.\"<ref name=\"Guy, Kolleen\"/> From the start to end of [[Belle \u00c9poque]] period, champagne has gone from a regional product with a niche market audience to a national commodity that distributed globally.\n\nA large popularity of Champagne is attributed to the success of Champagne producers in marketing the wine's image as a royal and aristocratic drink. [[Laurent-Perrier]]'s advertisements in late 1890 boasted their Champagne was the favourite of [[Leopold II of Belgium]], [[George I of Greece]], [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], [[Margaret Cambridge, Marchioness of Cambridge]], and [[John Lambton, 3rd Earl of Durham]], among other nobles, knights, and military officers. Despite this royal prestige, Champagne houses also portrayed Champagne as a luxury enjoyable by anyone, for any occasion.<ref name=\"Phillips p. 245\">{{cite book |author=R.

This is done by having the sweeter champagne associates with female, whereas the dry champagne with male and foreign markets.<ref name=\"Guy, Kolleen\"/> This was in stark contrast to the traditionally \"male aura\" that the wines of France had\u2014particularly [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] and [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]]. Laurent-Perrier again took the lead in this area with advertisements touting their wine's favour with the Countess of [[William Humble Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley|Dudley]], the wife of the 9th [[Earl of Stamford]], the wife of the [[Baron Tollemache]], and the opera singer [[Adelina Patti]]. Champagne labels were designed with images of romantic love and marriage as well as other special occasions that were deemed important to women, such as the [[baptism]] of a child.<ref name=\"Phillips p. 246\">{{cite book |author=R.

On some labels there were flattering images of [[Marie Antoinette]] that appealed to the conservative factions of French citizens that viewed the former queen as a martyr. On other labels there were stirring images of Revolutionary scenes that appealed to the liberal left sentiments of French citizens. As World War I loomed, Champagne houses put images of soldiers and countries' flags on their bottles, customizing the image for each country to which the wine was imported. During the [[Dreyfus affair]], one Champagne house released a ''champagne antijuif'' with antisemitic advertisements to take advantage of the wave of [[Antisemitism]] that hit parts of France.<ref name=\"Phillips p. 244\">{{cite book |author=R.

For example, British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] held a Champagne reception to celebrate London winning the right to host the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4394690.stm |title=Party celebrates 2012 Olympic win |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=31 October 2005 }}</ref> It is also used to [[ceremonial ship launching|launch ships]] when a bottle is smashed over the hull during the ship's launch. If the bottle fails to break this is often thought to be bad luck.\n\n==Grape varieties and styles==\nChampagne is a single ''{{lang|fr|[[appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]}}''. As a general rule, grapes used must be the white [[Chardonnay]], or the dark-skinned \"red wine grapes\" [[Pinot noir]] or [[Pinot Meunier]], which, due to the gentle [[pressing (wine)|pressing]] of the grapes and absence of skin contact during fermentation, usually also yield a white base wine. Most Champagnes, including Ros\u00e9 wines, are made from a blend of all three grapes, although ''{{lang|fr|blanc de blancs}}'' (\"white from whites\") Champagnes are made from 100% Chardonnay and ''{{lang|fr|blanc de noirs}}'' (\"white from blacks\") Champagnes are made solely from Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier or a mix of the two.<ref name=\"Stevenson pp. 169\u2013178\"/>\n\nFour other grape varieties are permitted, mostly for historical reasons, as they are rare in current usage. The 2010 version of the appellation regulations lists seven varieties as allowed, [[Arbane]], Chardonnay, [[Petit Meslier]], [[Pinot blanc]], [[Pinot gris]], Pinot Meunier, and Pinot noir.<ref name=\"AOC 2010\">{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000023126020&dateTexte=&oldAction=rechJO&categorieLien=id |title=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2010-1441 du 22 novembre 2010 relatif \u00e0 l'appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e \" Champagne \" |publisher=[[Journal officiel de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise]] number 273, text number 8 |date=25 November 2010 |page=21013 |trans-title=Decree number 2010-1441 of 22 November 2010, relating to the ''Appellation d'Origine Cont\u00f4l\u00e9e'' of 'Champagne' |language=fr}}</ref> The sparsely cultivated varieties (0.02% of the total vines planted in Champagne) of Arbanne, Petit Meslier and Pinot blanc, might still be found in modern cuv\u00e9es from a few producers.<ref name=\"deca-ch6\">{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Maggie |work=Decanter.com |title=Champagne house launches '6 grape' cuv\u00e9e |url=http://www.decanter.com/wine-news/champagne-house-launches-6-grape-cuvee-103313/ |date=8 January 2004 }}</ref> Previous directives of [[Institut National des Appellations d'Origine|INAO]] make conditional allowances according to the complex laws of 1927 and 1929, and plantings made before 1938.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Institut national de l'origine et de la qualit\u00e9]] (INAO) |title=AOC Champagne \u2013 Conditions de production |url=http://www.inao.gouv.fr/public/produits/showTexte.php?comiteNat=1&id_txt=18 |language=French }}</ref> Before the 2010 regulations, the complete list of the actual and theoretical varieties also included {{lang|fr|[[Pinot de Juillet]]}} and [[Pinot Ros\u00e9]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Les Maisons de Champagne |title=AOC Champagne: D\u00e9finition et loi |trans-title=AOC Champagne: Definition and law |url=http://www.maisons-champagne.com/bonal/pages/06/06-01_1.htm |language=French }}</ref> The [[Gamay]] vines of the region were scheduled to be uprooted by 1942, but due to [[World War II]], this was postponed until 1962,<ref name=\"ALEch\">{{Cite book |author=Alexis Lichine |title=Encyclopedia of Wines and Spirits |publisher=Cassell & Company Ltd |year=1967 |location=London |page=186 }}</ref> and this variety is no longer allowed in Champagne.<ref name=\"AOC 2010\"/>\n\nThe dark-skinned Pinot noir and Pinot meunier give the wine its length and backbone. They are predominantly grown in two areas \u2013 the [[Montagne de Reims]] and the [[Vall\u00e9e de la Marne]]. The Montagne de Reims run east-west to the south of Reims, in northern Champagne. They are notable for north-facing chalky slopes that derive heat from the warm winds rising from the valleys below. The River [[Marne (river)|Marne]] runs west\u2013east through Champagne, south of the Montagne de Reims. The Vall\u00e9e de la Marne contains south-facing chalky slopes. Chardonnay gives the wine its acidity and biscuit flavour. Most Chardonnay is grown in a north\u2013south-running strip to the south of [[\u00c9pernay]], called the {{lang|fr|[[C\u00f4te des Blancs]]}}, including the villages of [[Avize]], [[Oger, Marne|Oger]] and {{lang|fr|[[Le Mesnil-sur-Oger]]}}. These are east-facing vineyards, with ''{{lang|fr|terroir}}'' similar to the {{lang|fr|[[C\u00f4te de Beaune]]}}.

Most of the base will be from a single year vintage with producers blending anywhere from 10\u201315% (even as high as 40%) of wine from older vintages.<ref name=\"Stevenson pp. 169\u2013178\"/> If the conditions of a particular vintage are favourable, some producers will make a vintage wine that must be composed of 100% of the grapes from that vintage year.<ref>http://www.champagne.fr/assets/files/cles_champagne/appellation.pdf</ref> Under Champagne wine regulations, houses that make both vintage and non-vintage wines are allowed to use no more than 80% of the total vintage's harvest for the production of vintage Champagne. This allows at least 20% of the harvest from each vintage to be reserved for use in non-vintage Champagne. This ensures a consistent style that consumers can expect from non-vintage Champagne that does not alter too radically depending on the quality of the vintage. In less than ideal vintages, some producers will produce a wine from only that single vintage and still label it as non-vintage rather than as \"vintage\" since the wine will be of lesser quality and the producers have little desire to reserve the wine for future blending.<ref name=\"Stevenson pp. 169\u2013178\"/>\n\n====Prestige ''{{lang|fr|cuv\u00e9e}}''====\nA ''{{lang|fr|cuv\u00e9e de prestige}}'' is a proprietary blended wine (usually a Champagne) that is considered to be the top of a producer's range. Famous examples include [[Louis Roederer]]'s [[Cristal (wine)|Cristal]], {{lang|fr|[[Laurent-Perrier]]}}'s ''{{lang|fr|Grand Si\u00e8cle}}'', {{lang|fr|[[Mo\u00ebt & Chandon]]}}'s [[Dom P\u00e9rignon (wine)|Dom P\u00e9rignon]], [[Duval-Leroy]]'s ''{{lang|fr|Cuv\u00e9e Femme}}'', [[Armand de Brignac]] ''Gold Brut'', and [[Pol Roger]]'s ''{{lang|fr|Cuv\u00e9e Sir Winston Churchill}}''. Perhaps the first publicly available  prestige ''{{lang|fr|cuv\u00e9e}}'' was Mo\u00ebt & Chandon's Dom P\u00e9rignon, launched in 1936 with the 1921 vintage. Until then, Champagne houses produced different ''{{lang|fr|cuv\u00e9es}}'' of varying quality, but a top-of-the-range wine produced to the highest standards (and priced accordingly) was a new idea. In fact, [[Louis Roederer]] had been producing [[Cristal (wine)|Cristal]] since 1876, but this was strictly for the private consumption of the Russian [[tsar]]. Cristal was made publicly available with the 1945 vintage. Then came [[Taittinger]]'s ''{{lang|fr|Comtes de Champagne}}'' (first vintage 1952), and {{lang|fr|Laurent-Perrier}}'s ''{{lang|fr|Grand Si\u00e8cle 'La Cuv\u00e9e'}}'' in 1960, a blend of three vintages (1952, 1953, and 1955) and {{lang|fr|Perrier Jou\u00ebt}}'s ''{{lang|fr|La Belle \u00c9poque}}''. In the last three decades of the 20th century, most Champagne houses followed these with their own prestige ''{{lang|fr|cuv\u00e9es}}'', often named after notable people with a link to that producer and presented in non-standard bottle shapes (following Dom P\u00e9rignon's lead with its 18th-century revival design).\n\n====''{{lang|fr|Blanc de noirs}}''====\nA French term (literally \"white from blacks\" or \"white of blacks\") for a white wine produced entirely from black grapes. The flesh of grapes described as black or red is white; grape juice obtained after minimal possible contact with the skins produces essentially white wine, with a slightly yellower colour than wine from white grapes. The colour, due to the small amount of red skin pigments present, is often described as white-yellow, white-grey, or silvery. ''Blanc de noirs'' is often encountered in Champagne, where a number of houses have followed the lead of [[Bollinger]]'s ''prestige cuv\u00e9e'' Vieilles Vignes Fran\u00e7aises in introducing a ''[[cuv\u00e9e]]'' made from either pinot noir, pinot meunier or a blend of the two (these being the only two black grapes permitted within the Champagne AOC [[appellation]]).\n\n====''{{lang|fr|Blanc de blancs}}''====\n[[File:Blanc de blanc grand Cru champagne.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A Grand Cru blanc de blancs Champagne]]\n\nA French term that means \"white from whites\", and is used to designate Champagnes made exclusively from Chardonnay grapes or in rare occasions from Pinot blanc (such as ''{{lang|fr|La Bolor\u00e9e}}'' from Cedric Bouchard). The term is occasionally used in other sparkling wine-producing regions, usually to denote Chardonnay-only wines rather than any sparkling wine made from other white grape varieties.<ref name=\"Stevenson pp. 169\u2013178\"/>\n\n====Ros\u00e9 Champagne====\n\n\"Pink Champagne\" was a cheap, sweet version of sparkling wine made in the 1950s and early 1960s because the average American consumer at the time  thought brut champagne was too dry, but it has been discontinued.\n\nBrut rose Champagnes came along in the 1990s, a version as dry as regular brut Champagne. They are produced either by leaving the clear juice of black grapes to macerate on its skins for a brief time (known as the saign\u00e9e method) or, more commonly, by adding a small amount of still pinot noir red wine to the sparkling wine cuv\u00e9e. Champagne is typically light in colour even if it is produced with red grapes, because the juice is extracted from the grapes using a gentle process that minimizes the amount of time the juice spends in contact with the skins, which is what gives red wine its colour. Ros\u00e9 Champagne is one of the few wines that allow the production of ros\u00e9 by the addition of a small amount of red wine during blending. This ensures a predictable and reproducible colour, allowing a constant ros\u00e9 colour from year to year. It is popular in many countries and in high-end restaurants due to its soft yet sensitive taste, which is advantageous  in [[food and wine pairing]].<ref name=\"Stevenson pp. 169\u2013178\"/>\n\n===Sweetness===\nJust after disgorgement a \"liqueur de dosage\" <ref>https://maisons-champagne.com/en/appellation/stages-in-winemaking/preparation-for-shipment-many-years-later/article/dosage</ref> - a blend of - most times- cane sugar and wine (sugar amounts up to 750 g/litre)- is added to adjust the levels of sugar in the Champagne when bottled for sale, and hence the sweetness of the finished wine. Today sweetness is generally not looked for per se, dosage is used to fine tune the perception of acidity in the wine. Wines labeled ''{{lang|fr|Brut Zero}}'', more common among smaller producers,<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news |author=Eric Pfanner |title=Champagne Decoded: The Degrees of Sweet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/dining/22iht-wine22.html |accessdate=10 March 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=21 December 2012 }}</ref> have no added sugar and will usually be very dry, with less than 3 grams of residual sugar per litre in the finished wine. The following terms are used to describe the sweetness of the bottled wine:\n\n* ''{{lang|fr|Extra Brut}}'' (less than 6 grams of sugar per litre)\n* ''{{lang|fr|Brut}}'' (less than 12 grams)\n* ''Extra Dry'' (between 12 and 17 grams)\n* ''{{lang|fr|Sec}}'' (between 17 and 32 grams)\n* ''{{lang|fr|Demi-sec}}'' (between 32 and 50 grams)\n* ''{{lang|fr|Doux}}'' (50 grams)\n\nThe most common style today is ''{{lang|fr|Brut}}''. However, throughout the 19th century and into the early 20th century Champagne was generally much sweeter than it is today. Moreover, except in Britain, Champagne was drunk as [[dessert wine]]s (after the meal), rather than as table wines (with the meal).<ref>''Facts About Champagne and Other Sparkling Wines,'' [[Henry Vizetelly]] (1879), [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20889/20889-h/20889-h.htm pp. 213\u2013214]:<br>\n\"Manufacturers of champagne and other sparkling wines prepare them dry or sweet, light or strong, according to the markets for which they are designed. The sweet wines go to Russia and Germany, the sweet-toothed Muscovite regarding M. Louis Roederer's syrupy product as the beau-id\u00e9al of champagne, and the Germans demanding wines with 20 or more per cent. of liqueur, or nearly quadruple the quantity that is contained in the average champagnes shipped to England. France consumes light and moderately sweet wines; the United States gives a preference to the intermediate qualities; China, India, and other hot countries stipulate for light dry wines; while the very strong 214 ones go to Australia, the Cape, and other places where gold and diamonds and such-like trifles are from time to time \"prospected.\" Not merely the driest but the very best wines of the best manufacturers, and commanding of course the highest prices, are invariably reserved for the English market. Foreigners cannot understand the marked preference shown in England for exceedingly dry sparkling wines. They do not consider that as a rule they are drunk during dinner with the plats, and not at dessert, with all kinds of sweets, fruits, and ices, as is almost invariably the case abroad.\"</ref> At this time, Champagne sweetness was instead referred to by destination country, roughly as:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oneblockwest.com/gout-americain/ |title=Go\u00fbt Am\u00e9ricain |last= Matthews |first=Ed |website= One Blog West |date=2010-01-10 |access-date=2019-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702141551/http://oneblockwest.com/gout-americain/ |archive-date=2017-07-02}}</ref>\n* ''{{lang|fr|Go\u00fbt anglais}}'' (\"English taste\", between 22 and 66 grams); note that today ''{{lang|fr|go\u00fbt anglais}}'' refers to [[aging of wine|aged]] vintage Champagne\n* ''{{lang|fr|Go\u00fbt am\u00e9ricain}}'' (\"American taste\", between 110 and 165 grams)\n* ''{{lang|fr|Go\u00fbt fran\u00e7ais}}'' (\"French taste\", between 165 and 200 grams)\n* ''{{lang|fr|Go\u00fbt russe}}'' (\"Russian taste\", between 200 and 300 grams)\nOf these, only the driest English is close to contemporary tastes.\n\n==Champagne bottles==\n{{details|Wine bottle}}\n[[File:Veuve clicquot bottle sizes.jpg|right|thumb|Side-by-side comparison of Champagne bottles.

In general, magnums are thought to be higher quality, as there is less oxygen in the bottle, and the volume-to-surface area ratio favours the creation of appropriately sized bubbles. However, there is no hard evidence for this view. Other bottle sizes, mostly named for Biblical figures, are generally filled with Champagne that has been fermented in standard bottles or magnums.

The high sugar level was characteristic of people's tastes at the time, and Jeandet explained that it was common for people in the 19th century, such as Russians, to add sugar to their wine at dinner. It also contained higher concentrations of minerals such as iron, copper, and table salt than modern-day Champagne does.<ref>https://www.yahoo.com/food/what-does-a-170-year-old-champagne-found-on-the-116996097686.html</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Feltman |first=Rachel |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/04/21/170-year-old-shipwrecked-champagne-gets-a-taste-test/ |title=170-year-old, shipwrecked champagne gets a taste test |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=21 April 2015|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Champagne corks===\n[[File:Bouchon de champagne neuf.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|A Champagne cork before usage. Only the lower section, made of top-quality pristine cork, will be in contact with the Champagne]]\n[[File:Champagne-Corking-1855.jpg|right|frame|Corking a Champagne Bottle: 1855 engraving of the manual method]]\nChampagne corks are mostly built from three sections and are referred to as agglomerated corks. The mushroom shape that occurs in the transition is a result of the bottom section's being composed of two stacked discs of pristine cork cemented to the upper portion, which is a conglomerate of ground cork and glue. The bottom section is in contact with the wine. Before insertion, a sparkling wine cork is almost 50% larger than the opening of the bottle. Originally, the cork starts as a cylinder and is compressed before insertion into the bottle. Over time, their compressed shape becomes more permanent and the distinctive \"mushroom\" shape becomes more apparent.\n\nThe aging of the Champagne post-disgorgement can to some degree be told by the cork, as, the longer it has been in the bottle, the less it returns to its original cylinder shape.\n\n==Champagne etiquette==\n{{See also|Champagne stemware}}\nChampagne is usually served in a [[Champagne flute]], whose characteristics include a long stem with a tall, narrow bowl, thin sides and an etched bottom. The intended purpose of the shape of the flute is to reduce surface area, therefore preserving carbonation, as well as maximizing nucleation (the visible bubbles and lines of bubbles).<ref>Ames, D.

Often the bottle is chilled in a bucket of ice and water, half an hour before opening, which also ensures the Champagne is less gassy and can be opened without spillage. Champagne buckets are made specifically for this purpose and often have a larger volume than standard wine-cooling buckets to accommodate the larger bottle, and more water and ice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.cellarer.com/how-to-enjoy-champagne-wines/ |title=Storing and serving Champagne |publisher=Cellarer.com }}</ref>\n\n===Opening Champagne bottles===\nTo reduce the risk of spilling or spraying any Champagne, open the Champagne bottle by holding the cork and rotating the bottle at an angle in order to ease out the stopper. This method, as opposed to pulling the cork out, prevents the cork from flying out of the bottle at speed. (The expanding gases are supersonic.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liger-Belair |first1=Gerard |last2=Cordier |first2=Daniel |last3=Georges |first3=Robert |title=Under-expanded supersonic CO2 freezing jets during champagne cork popping |journal=Science Advances |date=20 September 2019 |volume=5 |issue=9 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.aav5528 |url=https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/9/eaav5528 |accessdate=29 September 2019|doi-access=free }}</ref>) Also, holding the bottle at an angle allows air in and helps prevent the champagne from geysering out of the bottle.\n\nA [[sabre]] can be used to open a Champagne bottle with great ceremony.

The [[Ancient Rome and wine|Romans]] were the first to plant vineyards in this area of north-east France, with the region being tentatively cultivated by the 5th century. In fact, cultivation was initially slow due to the unpopular edict by [[Domitian|Emperor Domitian]] that all colonial vines must be uprooted. When [[Probus (emperor)|Emperor Probus]], the son of a gardener, rescinded the edict, a temple to [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] was erected, and the region started to produce a red, light, and fruity wine that contrasted with heavier Italian brews often fortified with resin and herbs.<ref>Coates, Clive.

The Champenois were envious of the reputation of the wines made by their [[Burgundian (wine)|Burgundian]] neighbours to the south and sought to produce wines of equal acclaim. However, the northerly [[climate]] of the region gave the Champenois a unique set of challenges in making [[red wine]]. At the far extremes of sustainable [[viticulture]], the grapes would struggle to ripen fully and often would have bracing levels of [[acids in wine|acidity]] and low [[sugars in wine|sugar levels]]. The wines would be [[wine tasting descriptions|lighter bodied]] and thinner than the Burgundy wines they were seeking to outdo.<ref name=\"Johnson pg 210-219\">{{cite book |author=H.

At the time, bubbles were considered a fault. In 1844 Adolphe Jaquesson invented the [[muselet]] to prevent the corks from blowing out.

They include codification of the most suitable growing places; the most suitable grape types (most Champagne is a blend of up to three grape varieties, though other [[champagne#Grape varieties and styles|varieties are allowed]]); and a lengthy set of requirements specifying most aspects of [[viticulture]]. This includes pruning, vineyard yield, the degree of pressing, and the time that wine must remain on its [[lees (fermentation)|lees]] before bottling. It can also limit the release of Champagne to market to maintain prices. Only when a wine meets these requirements may it be labelled Champagne. The rules agreed upon by the CIVC are submitted for the final approval of the {{lang|fr|[[Institut national de l'origine et de la qualit\u00e9]]}} (formerly the  ''{{lang|fr|Institut National des Appellations d'Origine}}'', INAO).\n\nIn 2007 the INAO, the government organization that controls wine appellations in France, was preparing to make the largest revision of the region's legal boundaries since 1927, in response to economic pressures. With soaring demand and limited production of grapes, Champagne houses say the rising price could produce a consumer backlash that would harm the industry for years into the future. That, along with political pressure from villages that want to be included in the expanded boundaries, led to the move. Changes are subject to significant scientific review and are said to not impact Champagne produced grapes until 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nassauer |first=Sarah |title=Demand for Champagne gives Peas a chance |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=14 December 2007 |page=B1 }}</ref>\n\n===Use of the word ''Champagne''===\n[[File:Grape-Shot.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1915 English magazine illustration of a lady riding a Champagne cork (Lordprice Collection)]]\nSparkling wines are produced worldwide, but many legal structures reserve the word ''Champagne'' exclusively for sparkling wines from the Champagne region, made in accordance with {{lang|fr|[[Comit\u00e9 Interprofessionnel du vin de Champagne]]}} regulations. In the European Union and many other countries the name ''Champagne'' is [[protected designation of origin|legally protected]] by the [[Madrid system]] under an 1891 treaty, which reserved it for the sparkling wine produced in the eponymous region and adhering to the standards defined for it as an ''{{lang|fr|[[appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]}}''; the protection was reaffirmed in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] after World War I. Similar legal protection has been adopted by over 70 countries. Most recently [[Australia]],<ref>{{cite web |author=Christopher Werth |url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/life/australia-corks-its-use-champagne |title=Australia corks its use of 'champagne' |work=Marketplace |date=1 September 2010 }}</ref> [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]] and [[China]] passed laws or signed agreements with Europe that limit the use of the term \"Champagne\" to only those products produced in the Champagne region. The United States bans the use from all new U.S.-produced wines.<ref name=\"Section\">{{usc|26|5388}}</ref> Only those that had approval to use the term on labels before 2006 may continue to use it and only when it is accompanied by the wine's actual origin (e.g., \"California\").<ref name=\"Section\"/> The majority of US-produced sparkling wines do not use the term ''Champagne'' on their labels,<ref name=\"Champagne Bureau\">http://www.champagne.us</ref> and some states, such as Oregon,<ref name=\"Oregon State Law 471\">Oregon State Law 471, including 471.030, 471.730 (1) & (5)</ref> ban producers in their states from using the term.\n\nIn the United States name protection of wine-growing place names is becoming more important. Several key U.S. wine regions, such as those in California ([[Napa Valley AVA|Napa]], [[Sonoma Valley AVA|Sonoma Valley]], [[Paso Robles AVA|Paso Robles]]), [[Oregon wine|Oregon]], and [[Walla Walla Valley AVA|Walla Walla, Washington]], came to consider the remaining semi-generic labels as harmful to their reputations (cf. [[Napa Declaration on Place]]).\n\nEven the terms ''{{lang|fr|m\u00e9thode champenoise}}'' and ''Champagne method'' were forbidden by an EU court decision in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61993J0306:EN:NOT |title=Judgment of the Court of 13 December 1994, ''SMW Winzersekt GmbH v Land Rheinland-Pfalz'', Preliminary reference \u2013 Assessment of validity \u2013 Description of sparkling wines \u2013 Prohibition of reference to the method of production known as \"''m\u00e9thode champenoise''\" |accessdate=23 January 2007 }}</ref> {{as of|2005}} the description most often used for sparkling wines using the second fermentation in the bottle process, but not from the Champagne region, is ''{{lang|fr|m\u00e9thode traditionnelle}}''. Sparkling wines are produced worldwide, and many producers use special terms to define them: Spain uses ''[[Sparkling Wine#Cava|Cava]]'', Italy designates it ''{{lang|it|[[spumante]]}}'', and South Africa uses ''{{lang|fr|cap classique}}''. An Italian sparkling wine made from the [[Muscat (grape)|Muscat]] grape uses the [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOCG]] ''[[Asti wine|Asti]]'' and from the [[Glera (grape)|Glera]] grape the DOCG ''[[Prosecco]]''. In Germany, [[Sekt]] is a common sparkling wine. Other French wine regions cannot use the name Champagne: e.g., [[Burgundy]] and [[Alsace]] produce ''{{lang|fr|[[Cr\u00e9mant]]}}''. In 2008, more than 3,000 bottles of sparkling wine produced in California labelled with the term \"Champagne\" were destroyed by Belgian government authorities.<ref>{{cite news |author=Alexandra Stadnyk |title=Belgium destroys California bubbly |work=[[BusinessWeek]] online |date=10 January 2008 }}</ref>\n\nRegardless of the legal requirements for labeling, extensive education efforts by the Champagne region, and the use of alternative names by non-Champagne sparkling wine producers, some consumers and wine sellers, including \"Korbels California Champagne\",  use ''Champagne'' as a generic term for white sparkling wines, regardless of origin.\n\nThe village of [[Champagne, Switzerland]], has traditionally made a still wine labelled as \"Champagne\", the earliest records of viticulture dated to 1657. In an accord with the EU, the Swiss government conceded in 1999 that by 2004 the village would phase out use of the name. Sales dropped from 110,000 bottles a year to 32,000 after the change. In April 2008 the villagers resolved to fight against the restriction following a Swiss open-air vote.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7332473.stm |title=Swiss town fights champagne ban |date=5 April 2008 |work=[[BBC News Online]] }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union]] all sparkling wines were called {{lang|ru|\u0448\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435}} (''{{lang|ru-Latn|shampanskoe}}'', Russian for \"Champagne\").

After primary [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] and bottling, a second alcoholic fermentation occurs in the bottle. This second fermentation is induced by adding several grams of yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and rock sugar to the bottle - although each brand has its own secret recipe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.cellarer.com/champagne-yeastiness/ |publisher=Cellarer.com |title=Yeast taste in Champagne }}</ref> According to the ''{{lang|fr|[[appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]}}'' a minimum of 1.5 years is required to completely develop all the flavour. For years where the harvest is exceptional, a ''{{lang|fr|mill\u00e9sime}}'' is declared and some Champagne will be made from and labelled as the products of a single vintage rather than a blend of multiple years' harvests. This means that the Champagne will be very good and has to mature for at least 3 years. During this time the Champagne bottle is sealed with a [[crown cap]] similar to that used on beer bottles.<ref name=\"Oxford pp. 150\u2013153\"/>\n\nAfter aging, the bottle is manipulated, either manually or mechanically, in a process called ''{{lang|fr|remuage}}'' (or \"riddling\" in English), so that the [[lees (fermentation)|lees]] settle in the neck of the bottle. After chilling the bottles, the neck is frozen, and the cap removed. This process is called disgorgement. The pressure in the bottle forces out the ice containing the lees, some wine from previous vintages as well as additional sugar (''{{lang|fr|le dosage}}'') is added to maintain the level within the bottle and, importantly, adjust the sweetness of the finished wine and then the bottle is quickly corked to maintain the [[carbon dioxide]] in solution. .<ref name=\"Oxford pp. 150\u2013153\"/>\n\n===Bubbles===\n{{See also|Carbonation}}\n[[File:Rose Champagne Bubbles.jpg|thumb|left|Bubbles from ros\u00e9 Champagne]]\nAn initial burst of effervescence occurs when the Champagne contacts the dry glass on pouring.

The nucleation sites that act as a source for the ongoing effervescence are not natural imperfections in the glass, but actually occur where the glass has been etched by the manufacturer or the customer. This etching is typically done with acid, a laser, or a glass etching tool from a craft shop to provide nucleation sites for continuous bubble formation (note that not all glasses are etched in this way). In 1662 this method was developed in England, as records from the [[Royal Society]] show.\n\n[[Dom P\u00e9rignon (monk)|Dom P\u00e9rignon]] was originally charged by his superiors at the [[Abbey]] of [[Hautvillers]] to get rid of the bubbles since the pressure in the bottles caused many of them to burst in the cellar.<ref name=\"Kladstrup p. 25\">{{cite book |author=D. & P.

Web. 28 Feb. 2017.</ref> By selling champagne as a nationalist ideology, [[Winemaker|n\u00e9gociant]] manages to associate champagne with leisure activities and sporting events. In addition, n\u00e9gociant successfully appeal champagne to broader consumers by introducing the different qualities of sparkling wine, associating champagne brands with royalty and nobility, and selling off-brands under the name of the importer from France at a lower cost. Though selling off-brands at a lower expense proved to be unsuccessful since \"there was an assumption that cheap sparkling wine was not authentic.\"<ref name=\"Guy, Kolleen\"/> From the start to end of [[Belle \u00c9poque]] period, champagne has gone from a regional product with a niche market audience to a national commodity that distributed globally.\n\nA large popularity of Champagne is attributed to the success of Champagne producers in marketing the wine's image as a royal and aristocratic drink. [[Laurent-Perrier]]'s advertisements in late 1890 boasted their Champagne was the favourite of [[Leopold II of Belgium]], [[George I of Greece]], [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], [[Margaret Cambridge, Marchioness of Cambridge]], and [[John Lambton, 3rd Earl of Durham]], among other nobles, knights, and military officers. Despite this royal prestige, Champagne houses also portrayed Champagne as a luxury enjoyable by anyone, for any occasion.<ref name=\"Phillips p. 245\">{{cite book |author=R.

This is done by having the sweeter champagne associates with female, whereas the dry champagne with male and foreign markets.<ref name=\"Guy, Kolleen\"/> This was in stark contrast to the traditionally \"male aura\" that the wines of France had\u2014particularly [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] and [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]]. Laurent-Perrier again took the lead in this area with advertisements touting their wine's favour with the Countess of [[William Humble Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley|Dudley]], the wife of the 9th [[Earl of Stamford]], the wife of the [[Baron Tollemache]], and the opera singer [[Adelina Patti]]. Champagne labels were designed with images of romantic love and marriage as well as other special occasions that were deemed important to women, such as the [[baptism]] of a child.<ref name=\"Phillips p. 246\">{{cite book |author=R.

On some labels there were flattering images of [[Marie Antoinette]] that appealed to the conservative factions of French citizens that viewed the former queen as a martyr. On other labels there were stirring images of Revolutionary scenes that appealed to the liberal left sentiments of French citizens. As World War I loomed, Champagne houses put images of soldiers and countries' flags on their bottles, customizing the image for each country to which the wine was imported. During the [[Dreyfus affair]], one Champagne house released a ''champagne antijuif'' with antisemitic advertisements to take advantage of the wave of [[Antisemitism]] that hit parts of France.<ref name=\"Phillips p. 244\">{{cite book |author=R.

For example, British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] held a Champagne reception to celebrate London winning the right to host the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4394690.stm |title=Party celebrates 2012 Olympic win |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=31 October 2005 }}</ref> It is also used to [[ceremonial ship launching|launch ships]] when a bottle is smashed over the hull during the ship's launch. If the bottle fails to break this is often thought to be bad luck.\n\n==Grape varieties and styles==\nChampagne is a single ''{{lang|fr|[[appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]}}''. As a general rule, grapes used must be the white [[Chardonnay]], or the dark-skinned \"red wine grapes\" [[Pinot noir]] or [[Pinot Meunier]], which, due to the gentle [[pressing (wine)|pressing]] of the grapes and absence of skin contact during fermentation, usually also yield a white base wine. Most Champagnes, including Ros\u00e9 wines, are made from a blend of all three grapes, although ''{{lang|fr|blanc de blancs}}'' (\"white from whites\") Champagnes are made from 100% Chardonnay and ''{{lang|fr|blanc de noirs}}'' (\"white from blacks\") Champagnes are made solely from Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier or a mix of the two.<ref name=\"Stevenson pp. 169\u2013178\"/>\n\nFour other grape varieties are permitted, mostly for historical reasons, as they are rare in current usage. The 2010 version of the appellation regulations lists seven varieties as allowed, [[Arbane]], Chardonnay, [[Petit Meslier]], [[Pinot blanc]], [[Pinot gris]], Pinot Meunier, and Pinot noir.<ref name=\"AOC 2010\">{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000023126020&dateTexte=&oldAction=rechJO&categorieLien=id |title=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2010-1441 du 22 novembre 2010 relatif \u00e0 l'appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e \" Champagne \" |publisher=[[Journal officiel de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise]] number 273, text number 8 |date=25 November 2010 |page=21013 |trans-title=Decree number 2010-1441 of 22 November 2010, relating to the ''Appellation d'Origine Cont\u00f4l\u00e9e'' of 'Champagne' |language=fr}}</ref> The sparsely cultivated varieties (0.02% of the total vines planted in Champagne) of Arbanne, Petit Meslier and Pinot blanc, might still be found in modern cuv\u00e9es from a few producers.<ref name=\"deca-ch6\">{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Maggie |work=Decanter.com |title=Champagne house launches '6 grape' cuv\u00e9e |url=http://www.decanter.com/wine-news/champagne-house-launches-6-grape-cuvee-103313/ |date=8 January 2004 }}</ref> Previous directives of [[Institut National des Appellations d'Origine|INAO]] make conditional allowances according to the complex laws of 1927 and 1929, and plantings made before 1938.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Institut national de l'origine et de la qualit\u00e9]] (INAO) |title=AOC Champagne \u2013 Conditions de production |url=http://www.inao.gouv.fr/public/produits/showTexte.php?comiteNat=1&id_txt=18 |language=French }}</ref> Before the 2010 regulations, the complete list of the actual and theoretical varieties also included {{lang|fr|[[Pinot de Juillet]]}} and [[Pinot Ros\u00e9]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Les Maisons de Champagne |title=AOC Champagne: D\u00e9finition et loi |trans-title=AOC Champagne: Definition and law |url=http://www.maisons-champagne.com/bonal/pages/06/06-01_1.htm |language=French }}</ref> The [[Gamay]] vines of the region were scheduled to be uprooted by 1942, but due to [[World War II]], this was postponed until 1962,<ref name=\"ALEch\">{{Cite book |author=Alexis Lichine |title=Encyclopedia of Wines and Spirits |publisher=Cassell & Company Ltd |year=1967 |location=London |page=186 }}</ref> and this variety is no longer allowed in Champagne.<ref name=\"AOC 2010\"/>\n\nThe dark-skinned Pinot noir and Pinot meunier give the wine its length and backbone. They are predominantly grown in two areas \u2013 the [[Montagne de Reims]] and the [[Vall\u00e9e de la Marne]]. The Montagne de Reims run east-west to the south of Reims, in northern Champagne. They are notable for north-facing chalky slopes that derive heat from the warm winds rising from the valleys below. The River [[Marne (river)|Marne]] runs west\u2013east through Champagne, south of the Montagne de Reims. The Vall\u00e9e de la Marne contains south-facing chalky slopes. Chardonnay gives the wine its acidity and biscuit flavour. Most Chardonnay is grown in a north\u2013south-running strip to the south of [[\u00c9pernay]], called the {{lang|fr|[[C\u00f4te des Blancs]]}}, including the villages of [[Avize]], [[Oger, Marne|Oger]] and {{lang|fr|[[Le Mesnil-sur-Oger]]}}. These are east-facing vineyards, with ''{{lang|fr|terroir}}'' similar to the {{lang|fr|[[C\u00f4te de Beaune]]}}.

Most of the base will be from a single year vintage with producers blending anywhere from 10\u201315% (even as high as 40%) of wine from older vintages.<ref name=\"Stevenson pp. 169\u2013178\"/> If the conditions of a particular vintage are favourable, some producers will make a vintage wine that must be composed of 100% of the grapes from that vintage year.<ref>http://www.champagne.fr/assets/files/cles_champagne/appellation.pdf</ref> Under Champagne wine regulations, houses that make both vintage and non-vintage wines are allowed to use no more than 80% of the total vintage's harvest for the production of vintage Champagne. This allows at least 20% of the harvest from each vintage to be reserved for use in non-vintage Champagne. This ensures a consistent style that consumers can expect from non-vintage Champagne that does not alter too radically depending on the quality of the vintage. In less than ideal vintages, some producers will produce a wine from only that single vintage and still label it as non-vintage rather than as \"vintage\" since the wine will be of lesser quality and the producers have little desire to reserve the wine for future blending.<ref name=\"Stevenson pp. 169\u2013178\"/>\n\n====Prestige ''{{lang|fr|cuv\u00e9e}}''====\nA ''{{lang|fr|cuv\u00e9e de prestige}}'' is a proprietary blended wine (usually a Champagne) that is considered to be the top of a producer's range. Famous examples include [[Louis Roederer]]'s [[Cristal (wine)|Cristal]], {{lang|fr|[[Laurent-Perrier]]}}'s ''{{lang|fr|Grand Si\u00e8cle}}'', {{lang|fr|[[Mo\u00ebt & Chandon]]}}'s [[Dom P\u00e9rignon (wine)|Dom P\u00e9rignon]], [[Duval-Leroy]]'s ''{{lang|fr|Cuv\u00e9e Femme}}'', [[Armand de Brignac]] ''Gold Brut'', and [[Pol Roger]]'s ''{{lang|fr|Cuv\u00e9e Sir Winston Churchill}}''. Perhaps the first publicly available  prestige ''{{lang|fr|cuv\u00e9e}}'' was Mo\u00ebt & Chandon's Dom P\u00e9rignon, launched in 1936 with the 1921 vintage. Until then, Champagne houses produced different ''{{lang|fr|cuv\u00e9es}}'' of varying quality, but a top-of-the-range wine produced to the highest standards (and priced accordingly) was a new idea. In fact, [[Louis Roederer]] had been producing [[Cristal (wine)|Cristal]] since 1876, but this was strictly for the private consumption of the Russian [[tsar]]. Cristal was made publicly available with the 1945 vintage. Then came [[Taittinger]]'s ''{{lang|fr|Comtes de Champagne}}'' (first vintage 1952), and {{lang|fr|Laurent-Perrier}}'s ''{{lang|fr|Grand Si\u00e8cle 'La Cuv\u00e9e'}}'' in 1960, a blend of three vintages (1952, 1953, and 1955) and {{lang|fr|Perrier Jou\u00ebt}}'s ''{{lang|fr|La Belle \u00c9poque}}''. In the last three decades of the 20th century, most Champagne houses followed these with their own prestige ''{{lang|fr|cuv\u00e9es}}'', often named after notable people with a link to that producer and presented in non-standard bottle shapes (following Dom P\u00e9rignon's lead with its 18th-century revival design).\n\n====''{{lang|fr|Blanc de noirs}}''====\nA French term (literally \"white from blacks\" or \"white of blacks\") for a white wine produced entirely from black grapes. The flesh of grapes described as black or red is white; grape juice obtained after minimal possible contact with the skins produces essentially white wine, with a slightly yellower colour than wine from white grapes. The colour, due to the small amount of red skin pigments present, is often described as white-yellow, white-grey, or silvery. ''Blanc de noirs'' is often encountered in Champagne, where a number of houses have followed the lead of [[Bollinger]]'s ''prestige cuv\u00e9e'' Vieilles Vignes Fran\u00e7aises in introducing a ''[[cuv\u00e9e]]'' made from either pinot noir, pinot meunier or a blend of the two (these being the only two black grapes permitted within the Champagne AOC [[appellation]]).\n\n====''{{lang|fr|Blanc de blancs}}''====\n[[File:Blanc de blanc grand Cru champagne.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A Grand Cru blanc de blancs Champagne]]\n\nA French term that means \"white from whites\", and is used to designate Champagnes made exclusively from Chardonnay grapes or in rare occasions from Pinot blanc (such as ''{{lang|fr|La Bolor\u00e9e}}'' from Cedric Bouchard). The term is occasionally used in other sparkling wine-producing regions, usually to denote Chardonnay-only wines rather than any sparkling wine made from other white grape varieties.<ref name=\"Stevenson pp. 169\u2013178\"/>\n\n====Ros\u00e9 Champagne====\n\n\"Pink Champagne\" was a cheap, sweet version of sparkling wine made in the 1950s and early 1960s because the average American consumer at the time  thought brut champagne was too dry, but it has been discontinued.\n\nBrut rose Champagnes came along in the 1990s, a version as dry as regular brut Champagne. They are produced either by leaving the clear juice of black grapes to macerate on its skins for a brief time (known as the saign\u00e9e method) or, more commonly, by adding a small amount of still pinot noir red wine to the sparkling wine cuv\u00e9e. Champagne is typically light in colour even if it is produced with red grapes, because the juice is extracted from the grapes using a gentle process that minimizes the amount of time the juice spends in contact with the skins, which is what gives red wine its colour. Ros\u00e9 Champagne is one of the few wines that allow the production of ros\u00e9 by the addition of a small amount of red wine during blending. This ensures a predictable and reproducible colour, allowing a constant ros\u00e9 colour from year to year. It is popular in many countries and in high-end restaurants due to its soft yet sensitive taste, which is advantageous  in [[food and wine pairing]].<ref name=\"Stevenson pp. 169\u2013178\"/>\n\n===Sweetness===\nJust after disgorgement a \"liqueur de dosage\" <ref>https://maisons-champagne.com/en/appellation/stages-in-winemaking/preparation-for-shipment-many-years-later/article/dosage</ref> - a blend of - most times- cane sugar and wine (sugar amounts up to 750 g/litre)- is added to adjust the levels of sugar in the Champagne when bottled for sale, and hence the sweetness of the finished wine. Today sweetness is generally not looked for per se, dosage is used to fine tune the perception of acidity in the wine. Wines labeled ''{{lang|fr|Brut Zero}}'', more common among smaller producers,<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news |author=Eric Pfanner |title=Champagne Decoded: The Degrees of Sweet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/dining/22iht-wine22.html |accessdate=10 March 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=21 December 2012 }}</ref> have no added sugar and will usually be very dry, with less than 3 grams of residual sugar per litre in the finished wine. The following terms are used to describe the sweetness of the bottled wine:\n\n* ''{{lang|fr|Extra Brut}}'' (less than 6 grams of sugar per litre)\n* ''{{lang|fr|Brut}}'' (less than 12 grams)\n* ''Extra Dry'' (between 12 and 17 grams)\n* ''{{lang|fr|Sec}}'' (between 17 and 32 grams)\n* ''{{lang|fr|Demi-sec}}'' (between 32 and 50 grams)\n* ''{{lang|fr|Doux}}'' (50 grams)\n\nThe most common style today is ''{{lang|fr|Brut}}''. However, throughout the 19th century and into the early 20th century Champagne was generally much sweeter than it is today. Moreover, except in Britain, Champagne was drunk as [[dessert wine]]s (after the meal), rather than as table wines (with the meal).<ref>''Facts About Champagne and Other Sparkling Wines,'' [[Henry Vizetelly]] (1879), [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20889/20889-h/20889-h.htm pp. 213\u2013214]:<br>\n\"Manufacturers of champagne and other sparkling wines prepare them dry or sweet, light or strong, according to the markets for which they are designed. The sweet wines go to Russia and Germany, the sweet-toothed Muscovite regarding M. Louis Roederer's syrupy product as the beau-id\u00e9al of champagne, and the Germans demanding wines with 20 or more per cent. of liqueur, or nearly quadruple the quantity that is contained in the average champagnes shipped to England. France consumes light and moderately sweet wines; the United States gives a preference to the intermediate qualities; China, India, and other hot countries stipulate for light dry wines; while the very strong 214 ones go to Australia, the Cape, and other places where gold and diamonds and such-like trifles are from time to time \"prospected.\" Not merely the driest but the very best wines of the best manufacturers, and commanding of course the highest prices, are invariably reserved for the English market. Foreigners cannot understand the marked preference shown in England for exceedingly dry sparkling wines. They do not consider that as a rule they are drunk during dinner with the plats, and not at dessert, with all kinds of sweets, fruits, and ices, as is almost invariably the case abroad.\"</ref> At this time, Champagne sweetness was instead referred to by destination country, roughly as:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oneblockwest.com/gout-americain/ |title=Go\u00fbt Am\u00e9ricain |last= Matthews |first=Ed |website= One Blog West |date=2010-01-10 |access-date=2019-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702141551/http://oneblockwest.com/gout-americain/ |archive-date=2017-07-02}}</ref>\n* ''{{lang|fr|Go\u00fbt anglais}}'' (\"English taste\", between 22 and 66 grams); note that today ''{{lang|fr|go\u00fbt anglais}}'' refers to [[aging of wine|aged]] vintage Champagne\n* ''{{lang|fr|Go\u00fbt am\u00e9ricain}}'' (\"American taste\", between 110 and 165 grams)\n* ''{{lang|fr|Go\u00fbt fran\u00e7ais}}'' (\"French taste\", between 165 and 200 grams)\n* ''{{lang|fr|Go\u00fbt russe}}'' (\"Russian taste\", between 200 and 300 grams)\nOf these, only the driest English is close to contemporary tastes.\n\n==Champagne bottles==\n{{details|Wine bottle}}\n[[File:Veuve clicquot bottle sizes.jpg|right|thumb|Side-by-side comparison of Champagne bottles.

In general, magnums are thought to be higher quality, as there is less oxygen in the bottle, and the volume-to-surface area ratio favours the creation of appropriately sized bubbles. However, there is no hard evidence for this view. Other bottle sizes, mostly named for Biblical figures, are generally filled with Champagne that has been fermented in standard bottles or magnums. [[Gosset]] still bottles its Grande R\u00e9serve in jeroboam from the beginning of its second fermentation.\n\nSizes larger than Jeroboam (3 L) are rare.

The high sugar level was characteristic of people's tastes at the time, and Jeandet explained that it was common for people in the 19th century, such as Russians, to add sugar to their wine at dinner. It also contained higher concentrations of minerals such as iron, copper, and table salt than modern-day Champagne does.<ref>https://www.yahoo.com/food/what-does-a-170-year-old-champagne-found-on-the-116996097686.html</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Feltman |first=Rachel |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/04/21/170-year-old-shipwrecked-champagne-gets-a-taste-test/ |title=170-year-old, shipwrecked champagne gets a taste test |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=21 April 2015|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Champagne corks===\n[[File:Bouchon de champagne neuf.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|A Champagne cork before usage. Only the lower section, made of top-quality pristine cork, will be in contact with the Champagne]]\n[[File:Champagne-Corking-1855.jpg|right|frame|Corking a Champagne Bottle: 1855 engraving of the manual method]]\nChampagne corks are mostly built from three sections and are referred to as agglomerated corks. The mushroom shape that occurs in the transition is a result of the bottom section's being composed of two stacked discs of pristine cork cemented to the upper portion, which is a conglomerate of ground cork and glue. The bottom section is in contact with the wine. Before insertion, a sparkling wine cork is almost 50% larger than the opening of the bottle. Originally, the cork starts as a cylinder and is compressed before insertion into the bottle. Over time, their compressed shape becomes more permanent and the distinctive \"mushroom\" shape becomes more apparent.\n\nThe aging of the Champagne post-disgorgement can to some degree be told by the cork, as, the longer it has been in the bottle, the less it returns to its original cylinder shape.\n\n==Champagne etiquette==\n{{See also|Champagne stemware}}\nChampagne is usually served in a [[Champagne flute]], whose characteristics include a long stem with a tall, narrow bowl, thin sides and an etched bottom. The intended purpose of the shape of the flute is to reduce surface area, therefore preserving carbonation, as well as maximizing nucleation (the visible bubbles and lines of bubbles).<ref>Ames, D.

Often the bottle is chilled in a bucket of ice and water, half an hour before opening, which also ensures the Champagne is less gassy and can be opened without spillage. Champagne buckets are made specifically for this purpose and often have a larger volume than standard wine-cooling buckets to accommodate the larger bottle, and more water and ice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.cellarer.com/how-to-enjoy-champagne-wines/ |title=Storing and serving Champagne |publisher=Cellarer.com }}</ref>\n\n===Opening Champagne bottles===\nTo reduce the risk of spilling or spraying any Champagne, open the Champagne bottle by holding the cork and rotating the bottle at an angle in order to ease out the stopper. This method, as opposed to pulling the cork out, prevents the cork from flying out of the bottle at speed. (The expanding gases are supersonic.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liger-Belair |first1=Gerard |last2=Cordier |first2=Daniel |last3=Georges |first3=Robert |title=Under-expanded supersonic CO2 freezing jets during champagne cork popping |journal=Science Advances |date=20 September 2019 |volume=5 |issue=9 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.aav5528 |url=https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/9/eaav5528 |accessdate=29 September 2019|doi-access=free }}</ref>) Also, holding the bottle at an angle allows air in and helps prevent the champagne from geysering out of the bottle.\n\nA [[sabre]] can be used to open a Champagne bottle with great ceremony. This technique is called ''{{lang|fr|[[sabrage]]}}'' (the term is also used for simply breaking the head of the bottle).\n\n===Pouring Champagne===\nPouring sparkling wine while tilting the glass at an angle and gently sliding in the liquid along the side will preserve the most bubbles, as opposed to pouring directly down to create a head of \"mousse\", according to a study, ''On the Losses of Dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> during Champagne serving'', by scientists from the [[University of Reims]].<ref name=keller>{{cite news |author=Greg Keller |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=12 August 2010 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2010/08/12/champagne_fizzics_science_backs_pouring_sideways/ |title=Champagne fizzics: Science backs pouring sideways }}</ref>  Colder bottle temperatures also result in reduced loss of gas.<ref name=keller /> Additionally, the industry is developing Champagne glasses designed specifically to reduce the amount of gas lost.<ref>{{Cite news |title=How to pour champagne properly |url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/homestyle/how-to-pour-champagne-properly-20100813-122ph.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=29 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Spraying Champagne===\n{{Listen\n|filename=\n|title=\"Emily Ratajkowski spraying champagne for 2013 GQ T\u00fcrkiye photo shoot\"\n|description=Model [[Emily Ratajkowski]] spraying champagne for the 2013 ''[[GQ]]'' T\u00fcrkiye [[photo shoot]]\n|format=[[Ogg]]\n|image=none\n}}\n[[File:Champagne celebration - tour of gippsland.jpg|thumb|250px|Champagne on the podium of the 2007 Tour of [[Gippsland]]]]\nChampagne has been an integral part of sports celebration since {{lang|fr|[[Mo\u00ebt & Chandon]]}} started offering their Champagne to the winners of [[Formula 1 Grand Prix]] events.
