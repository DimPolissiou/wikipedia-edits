Penn's periodical \"The Alumni Register,\" published by the General Alumni Society, then began a grassroots campaign to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740, in order to appear older than [[Princeton University]], which had been chartered in 1746.  In 1899, the Board of Trustees acceded to the alumni initiative and voted to change the founding date to 1740.  The rationale offered in 1899 was that, in 1750, founder Benjamin Franklin and his original board of trustees purchased a completed but unused building and assumed an unnamed trust from a group that had hoped to begin a church and charity school in Philadelphia.  This edifice was commonly called the \"New Building\" by local citizens and was referred to by such name in Franklin's memoirs as well as the legal bill of sale in Penn's archives.  No name is stated or known for the associated educational trust, hence \"Unnamed Charity School\" serves as a placeholder to refer to the trust which is the premise for Penn's association with a founding date of 1740.  The first named entity in Penn's early history was the 1751 secondary school for boys and charity school for indigent children called \"Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania.\"[http://www.upenn.edu/about/heritage.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020235939/http://www.upenn.edu/about/heritage.php |date=2012-10-20 }}  Undergraduate education began in 1755 and the organization then changed its name to \"College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\"[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428155156/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html |date=2006-04-28 }} Operation of the charity school was discontinued a few years later.</ref> \n|Nonsectarian,<ref>Penn's website, like other sources, makes an important point of Penn's heritage being nonsectarian, associated with [[Benjamin Franklin]] and the Academy of Philadelphia's nonsectarian board of trustees: \"The goal of Franklin's nonsectarian, practical plan would be the education of a business and governing class rather than of clergymen.\"[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428155156/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html |date=2006-04-28 }}.

The school was to have operated inside a church supported by the same group of adherents.  But the organizers ran short of financing and, although the frame of the building was raised, the interior was left unfinished.  The founders of the Academy of Philadelphia purchased the unused building in 1750 for their new venture and, in the process, assumed the original trust.  Since 1899, Penn has claimed a founding date of 1740, based on the organizational date of the charity school and the premise that it had institutional identity with the Academy of Philadelphia. Whitefield was a firebrand Methodist associated with [[Great Awakening|The Great Awakening]]; since the Methodists did not formally break from the Church of England until 1784, Whitefield in 1740 would be labeled [[Church of England|Episcopalian]], and in fact ''Brown'' University, emphasizing its own pioneering nonsectarianism, refers to Penn's origin as \"Episcopalian\".[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118080913/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |date=2012-01-18 }} Penn is sometimes assumed to have Quaker ties (its athletic teams are called \"Quakers,\" and the cross-registration alliance between Penn, Haverford, Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr is known as the \"Quaker Consortium.\") But Penn's website does not assert any formal affiliation with Quakerism, historic or otherwise, and [[Haverford College]] implicitly asserts a non-Quaker origin for Penn when it states that \"Founded in 1833, Haverford is the oldest institution of higher learning with Quaker roots in North America.\"{{cite web |url=http://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/news/QandA.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204054925/https://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/news/QandA.html |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}</ref> founded by [[Church of England]]/[[Methodism|Methodist]] members<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Protestant Episcopal Church |volume=22 |pages=473\u2013475 |first=Daniel Dulany |last=Addison }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |title=Brown Admission: Our History |publisher=Brown.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208022301/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |archive-date=2011-02-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|-\n|Princeton University\n|1746 as ''College of New Jersey''\n|Nonsectarian,<ref name=\"princetonchapeltour\"/> founded by Calvinist [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]<ref name=\"princetonchapeltour\">{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~oktour/virtualtour/english/Stop05.htm|title=University Chapel: Orange Key Virtual Tour of Princeton University|publisher=Princeton University}}</ref>\n|-\n|Columbia University\n|1754 as ''King's College''\n|Church of England\n|-\n|Brown University\n|1764 as the ''College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations''\n|[[Baptist]], founding charter promises \"no religious tests\" and \"full liberty of conscience\"<ref>Brown's website characterizes it as \"the Baptist answer to Congregationalist Yale and Harvard; Presbyterian Princeton; and Episcopalian Penn and Columbia,\" but adds that at the time it was \"the only one that welcomed students of all religious persuasions.\"[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118080913/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |date=2012-01-18 }} Brown's charter stated that \"into this liberal and catholic institution shall never be admitted any religious tests, but on the contrary, all the members hereof shall forever enjoy full, free, absolute, and uninterrupted liberty of conscience.\" The charter called for twenty-two of the thirty-six trustees to be Baptists, but required that the remainder be \"five Friends, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians.\"{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Providence |volume=22 |page=511}}</ref>\n|-\n|Dartmouth College\n|1769\n|Calvinist (Congregationalist)\n|-\n|Cornell University\n|1865\n|Nonsectarian\n|}\n\n:<small>'''Note:''' Six of the eight Ivy League universities consider their founding dates to be simply the date that they received their charters and thus became legal corporations with the authority to grant academic degrees.

In 1899, Penn's board of trustees formally adopted a third founding date of 1740, in response to a petition from Penn's General Alumni Society.  Penn was chartered in 1755, the same year collegiate classes began.  \"Religious affiliation\" refers to financial sponsorship, formal association with, and promotion by, a religious denomination.

These schools were known for their long-standing traditions in intercollegiate athletics, often being the first schools to participate in such activities. However, at this time, none of these institutions made efforts to form an athletic league.\n\nA common [[folk etymology]] attributes the name to the Roman numeral for four (IV), asserting that there was such a sports league originally with four members. The ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' helped to perpetuate this belief. The supposed \"IV League\" was formed over a century ago and consisted of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and a fourth school that varies depending on who is telling the story.<ref>The [[Chicago Public Library]] reports the \"IV League\" explanation, [http://www.chipublib.org/008subject/005genre/faqiv.html] sourced only from the ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins''. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>Various ''Ask Ezra'' student columns report the \"IV League\" explanation, apparently relying on the ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' as the sole source: [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=895550400#question13] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=798955200#question9] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=639892800#question5]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html |title=The Penn Current / October 17, 2002 / Ask Benny |publisher=Upenn.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606232308/http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html |archivedate=June 6, 2010 |df= }}</ref> However, it is clear that [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia]] met on November 23, 1876 at the so-called Massasoit Convention to decide on uniform rules for the emerging game of American football, which rapidly spread.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/football/1800s/origins.html |title=This according to the Penn history of varsity football |publisher=Archives.upenn.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718192438/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/football/1800s/origins.html |archive-date=2010-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Pre-Ivy League===\n[[File:Chancellor Green exterior Princeton.JPG|thumb|Chancellor Green Library at Princeton, 2007]]\n[[File:Brown university robinson hall 2009a.JPG|thumb|Robinson Hall at Brown, 2009]]\n[[File:Cornell Baseball2.jpg|thumb|upright|Cornell baseball player, 1908]]\n\nSeven out of the eight Ivy League schools were founded before the [[American Revolution]]; Cornell was founded just after the [[American Civil War]]. These seven were the primary colleges in the Northern and Middle Colonies, and their early faculties and founding boards were largely drawn from other Ivy League institutions. There were also some British graduates from the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of St. Andrews]], the [[University of Edinburgh]], and elsewhere on their boards. Similarly, the founder of the [[College of William & Mary]], in 1693, was a British graduate of the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the University of Edinburgh. Cornell provided [[Stanford University]] with its [[David Starr Jordan|first president]].\n\nThe influence of these institutions on the founding of other colleges and universities is notable. This included the Southern public college movement which blossomed in the decades surrounding the turn of the 19th century when Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia established what became the flagship universities for each of these states. In 1801, a majority of the first board of trustees for what became the [[University of South Carolina]] were Princeton alumni. They appointed [[Jonathan Maxcy]], a Brown graduate, as the university's first president. [[Thomas Cooper (American politician, born 1759)|Thomas Cooper]], an Oxford alumnus and University of Pennsylvania faculty member, became the second president of the South Carolina college. The founders of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] came from Yale, hence the school colors of University of California at Berkeley are [[Yale Blue]] and California Gold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/r01_04.html |title=Resource: Student history |publisher=Resource.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909165637/http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/r01_04.html |archivedate=2010-09-09 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSome of the Ivy League schools have identifiable [[Protestant]] roots, while others were founded as non-sectarian schools. [[Church of England]] ''King's College'' broke up during the Revolution and was reformed as public nonsectarian [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]]. In the early nineteenth century, the specific purpose of training Calvinist ministers was handed off to theological seminaries, but a denominational tone and such relics as compulsory chapel often lasted well into the twentieth century. Penn and Brown were officially founded as nonsectarian schools. Brown's charter promised no religious tests and \"full liberty of conscience\", but placed control in the hands of a board of twenty-two Baptists, five Quakers, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians. Cornell has been strongly nonsectarian from its founding.\n\n\"Ivy League\" is sometimes used as a way of referring to an [[elite]] [[Social class|class]], even though institutions such as Cornell University were among the first in the United States to reject racial and gender discrimination in their admissions policies. This dates back to at least 1935.<ref>{{cite book | title=Snobbery: The American Version | first=Joseph | last=Epstein | year=2003 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | isbn=0-618-34073-4 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/snobbery00jose }} p. 55, \"by WASP Baltzell meant something much more specific; he intended to cover a select group of people who passed through a congeries of elite American institutions: certain eastern [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]], the Ivy League colleges, and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] among them.\"</ref> Novels<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite book | first = Louis | last = Auchincloss | title = East Side Story | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-618-45244-3 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | url = https://archive.org/details/eastsidestorynov00auch_0 }} p. 179, \"he dreaded the aridity of snobbery which he knew infected the Ivy League colleges\"</ref> and memoirs<ref>{{cite book | title = Project Girl | first = Janet |last = McDonald | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2000|isbn = 0-520-22345-4}} p. 163 \"''Newsweek'' is a morass of incest, nepotism, elitism, racism and utter classic white male patriarchal corruption. ...

They had always had distinguished faculties; some of the first Americans with [[doctorate]]s had taught for them; but they now decided that they could not both be world-class research institutions and be competitive in the highest ranks of American college sport; in addition, the schools experienced the scandals of any other big-time football programs, although more quietly.<ref>scandals: James Axtell, ''The Making of Princeton University'' (2006), p.274; quoting a former executive director of the Ivy League</ref>\n\n===History of the athletic league===\n[[File:Yale's four-oared crew team with 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy.jpg|thumb|Yale University's four-oared crew team, posing with the 1876 Centennial [[Regatta]] trophy.]]\n[[File:The 1879 Brown University Baseball Team.jpg|thumb|The 1879 Brown baseball varsity, with [[William Edward White|W.E.

The RAAC hosted a de facto national championship in rowing during the period 1870\u20131894. In 1895, Cornell, Columbia, and Penn founded the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]], which remains the oldest collegiate athletic organizing body in the US. To this day, the IRA Championship Regatta determines the national champion in rowing and all of the Ivies are regularly invited to compete.\n\nA basketball league was later created in 1902, when Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Yale and Princeton formed the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League]]; they were later joined by Penn and Dartmouth.\n\nIn 1906, the organization that eventually became the [[NCAA|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] was formed, primarily to formalize rules for the emerging sport of football. But of the 39 original member colleges in the NCAA, only two of them (Dartmouth and Penn) later became Ivies.\n\nIn February 1903, intercollegiate wrestling began when Yale accepted a challenge from Columbia, published in the Yale News. The dual meet took place prior to a basketball game hosted by Columbia and resulted in a tie. Two years later, Penn and Princeton also added wrestling teams, leading to the formation of the student-run Intercollegiate Wrestling Association, now the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association]] (EIWA), the first and oldest collegiate wrestling league in the US.<ref>{{cite news | title = Columbia Celebrates College Wrestling Centennial | publisher = Columbia College Today | url = http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/may03/features5.php | access-date = 2014-09-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141010054526/http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/may03/features5.php | archive-date = 2014-10-10 | url-status=dead | df =  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Penn, Princeton and Yale formed the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League]]; they were later joined by Harvard, Brown, Army and Navy.\n\nBefore the formal establishment of the Ivy League, there was an \"unwritten and unspoken agreement among certain Eastern colleges on athletic relations\". The earliest reference to the \"Ivy colleges\" came in 1933, when [[Stanley Woodward]] of the [[New York Herald Tribune]] used it to refer to the eight current members plus Army.<ref name=officialhistory/>  In 1935, the [[Associated Press]] reported on an example of collaboration between the schools:\n\n{{quote|The athletic authorities of the so-called \"Ivy League\" are considering drastic measures to curb the increasing tendency toward riotous attacks on goal posts and other encroachments by spectators on playing fields.|The Associated Press|''The New York Times''<ref>{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | title = Colleges Searching for Check On Trend to Goal Post Riots | work = The New York Times | page = 33 | date = 1935-12-06 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1935/12/06/archives/colleges-searching-for-check-on-trend-to-goal-post-riots-eastern.html}}</ref>}}\n\nDespite such collaboration, the universities did not seem to consider the formation of the league as imminent. [[Romeyn Berry]], Cornell's manager of athletics, reported the situation in January 1936 as follows:\n\n{{quote|text=I can say with certainty that in the last five years\u2014and markedly in the last three months\u2014there has been a strong drift among the eight or ten universities of the East which see a good deal of one another in sport toward a closer bond of confidence and cooperation and toward the formation of a common front against the threat of a breakdown in the ideals of amateur sport in the interests of supposed expediency.\n\nPlease do not regard that statement as implying the organization of an Eastern conference or even a poetic \"Ivy League\".

Harvard's team, \"The Oneida\", won the race and was presented with trophy black walnut oars from then-presidential nominee General [[Franklin Pierce]].\nThe proposal did not succeed\u2014on January 11, 1937, the athletic authorities at the schools rejected the \"possibility of a heptagonal league in football such as these institutions maintain in basketball, baseball and track.\" However, they noted that the league \"has such promising possibilities that it may not be dismissed and must be the subject of further consideration.\"<ref>{{cite news | title = Plea for an Ivy Football League Rejected by College Authorities | work = The New York Times | page = 26 | date = 1937-01-12}}</ref>\n\n====Post-World War II====\n[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-11-06 Tuck School of Business.JPG|thumb|Students in Stell Hall at Dartmouth's [[Tuck School of Business]], 2007]]\n[[File:Scroll and Key 1866 delegation Yale College.jpg|thumb|Students of Yale College, 1866]]\n\nIn 1945 the presidents of the eight schools signed the first ''Ivy Group Agreement'', which set academic, financial, and athletic standards for the [[American football|football]] teams. The principles established reiterated those put forward in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Presidents' Agreement of 1916. The Ivy Group Agreement established the core tenet that an applicant's ability to play on a team would not influence admissions decisions:\n\n{{quote|The members of the Group reaffirm their prohibition of athletic scholarships.

This is generally reckoned as the formal formation of the Ivy League. As part of the transition, Brown, the only Ivy that hadn't joined the EIBL, did so for the 1954\u201355 season. A year later, the Ivy League absorbed the EIBL. The Ivy League claims the EIBL's history as its own.

Before they became coeducational, many of the Ivy schools maintained extensive social ties with nearby [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] [[women's college]]s, including weekend visits, dances and parties inviting Ivy and Seven Sisters students to mingle.

Penn's periodical \"The Alumni Register,\" published by the General Alumni Society, then began a grassroots campaign to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740, in order to appear older than [[Princeton University]], which had been chartered in 1746.  In 1899, the Board of Trustees acceded to the alumni initiative and voted to change the founding date to 1740.  The rationale offered in 1899 was that, in 1750, founder Benjamin Franklin and his original board of trustees purchased a completed but unused building and assumed an unnamed trust from a group that had hoped to begin a church and charity school in Philadelphia.  This edifice was commonly called the \"New Building\" by local citizens and was referred to by such name in Franklin's memoirs as well as the legal bill of sale in Penn's archives.  No name is stated or known for the associated educational trust, hence \"Unnamed Charity School\" serves as a placeholder to refer to the trust which is the premise for Penn's association with a founding date of 1740.  The first named entity in Penn's early history was the 1751 secondary school for boys and charity school for indigent children called \"Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania.\"[http://www.upenn.edu/about/heritage.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020235939/http://www.upenn.edu/about/heritage.php |date=2012-10-20 }}  Undergraduate education began in 1755 and the organization then changed its name to \"College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\"[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428155156/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html |date=2006-04-28 }} Operation of the charity school was discontinued a few years later.</ref> \n|Nonsectarian,<ref>Penn's website, like other sources, makes an important point of Penn's heritage being nonsectarian, associated with [[Benjamin Franklin]] and the Academy of Philadelphia's nonsectarian board of trustees: \"The goal of Franklin's nonsectarian, practical plan would be the education of a business and governing class rather than of clergymen.\"[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428155156/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html |date=2006-04-28 }}.

The school was to have operated inside a church supported by the same group of adherents.  But the organizers ran short of financing and, although the frame of the building was raised, the interior was left unfinished.  The founders of the Academy of Philadelphia purchased the unused building in 1750 for their new venture and, in the process, assumed the original trust.  Since 1899, Penn has claimed a founding date of 1740, based on the organizational date of the charity school and the premise that it had institutional identity with the Academy of Philadelphia. Whitefield was a firebrand Methodist associated with [[Great Awakening|The Great Awakening]]; since the Methodists did not formally break from the Church of England until 1784, Whitefield in 1740 would be labeled [[Church of England|Episcopalian]], and in fact ''Brown'' University, emphasizing its own pioneering nonsectarianism, refers to Penn's origin as \"Episcopalian\".[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118080913/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |date=2012-01-18 }} Penn is sometimes assumed to have Quaker ties (its athletic teams are called \"Quakers,\" and the cross-registration alliance between Penn, Haverford, Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr is known as the \"Quaker Consortium.\") But Penn's website does not assert any formal affiliation with Quakerism, historic or otherwise, and [[Haverford College]] implicitly asserts a non-Quaker origin for Penn when it states that \"Founded in 1833, Haverford is the oldest institution of higher learning with Quaker roots in North America.\"{{cite web |url=http://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/news/QandA.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204054925/https://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/news/QandA.html |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}</ref> founded by [[Church of England]]/[[Methodism|Methodist]] members<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Protestant Episcopal Church |volume=22 |pages=473\u2013475 |first=Daniel Dulany |last=Addison }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |title=Brown Admission: Our History |publisher=Brown.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208022301/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |archive-date=2011-02-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|-\n|Princeton University\n|1746 as ''College of New Jersey''\n|Nonsectarian,<ref name=\"princetonchapeltour\"/> founded by Calvinist [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]<ref name=\"princetonchapeltour\">{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~oktour/virtualtour/english/Stop05.htm|title=University Chapel: Orange Key Virtual Tour of Princeton University|publisher=Princeton University}}</ref>\n|-\n|Columbia University\n|1754 as ''King's College''\n|Church of England\n|-\n|Brown University\n|1764 as the ''College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations''\n|[[Baptist]], founding charter promises \"no religious tests\" and \"full liberty of conscience\"<ref>Brown's website characterizes it as \"the Baptist answer to Congregationalist Yale and Harvard; Presbyterian Princeton; and Episcopalian Penn and Columbia,\" but adds that at the time it was \"the only one that welcomed students of all religious persuasions.\"[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118080913/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |date=2012-01-18 }} Brown's charter stated that \"into this liberal and catholic institution shall never be admitted any religious tests, but on the contrary, all the members hereof shall forever enjoy full, free, absolute, and uninterrupted liberty of conscience.\" The charter called for twenty-two of the thirty-six trustees to be Baptists, but required that the remainder be \"five Friends, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians.\"{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Providence |volume=22 |page=511}}</ref>\n|-\n|Dartmouth College\n|1769\n|Calvinist (Congregationalist)\n|-\n|Cornell University\n|1865\n|Nonsectarian\n|}\n\n:<small>'''Note:''' Six of the eight Ivy League universities consider their founding dates to be simply the date that they received their charters and thus became legal corporations with the authority to grant academic degrees.

These schools were known for their long-standing traditions in intercollegiate athletics, often being the first schools to participate in such activities. However, at this time, none of these institutions made efforts to form an athletic league.\n\nA common [[folk etymology]] attributes the name to the Roman numeral for four (IV), asserting that there was such a sports league originally with four members.

The supposed \"IV League\" was formed over a century ago and consisted of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and a fourth school that varies depending on who is telling the story.<ref>The [[Chicago Public Library]] reports the \"IV League\" explanation, [http://www.chipublib.org/008subject/005genre/faqiv.html] sourced only from the ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins''. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>Various ''Ask Ezra'' student columns report the \"IV League\" explanation, apparently relying on the ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' as the sole source: [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=895550400#question13] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=798955200#question9] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=639892800#question5]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html |title=The Penn Current / October 17, 2002 / Ask Benny |publisher=Upenn.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606232308/http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html |archivedate=June 6, 2010 |df= }}</ref> However, it is clear that [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia]] met on November 23, 1876 at the so-called Massasoit Convention to decide on uniform rules for the emerging game of American football, which rapidly spread.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/football/1800s/origins.html |title=This according to the Penn history of varsity football |publisher=Archives.upenn.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718192438/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/football/1800s/origins.html |archive-date=2010-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Pre-Ivy League===\n[[File:Chancellor Green exterior Princeton.JPG|thumb|Chancellor Green Library at Princeton, 2007]]\n[[File:Brown university robinson hall 2009a.JPG|thumb|Robinson Hall at Brown, 2009]]\n[[File:Cornell Baseball2.jpg|thumb|upright|Cornell baseball player, 1908]]\n\nSeven out of the eight Ivy League schools were founded before the [[American Revolution]]; Cornell was founded just after the [[American Civil War]]. These seven were the primary colleges in the Northern and Middle Colonies, and their early faculties and founding boards were largely drawn from other Ivy League institutions. There were also some British graduates from the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of St. Andrews]], the [[University of Edinburgh]], and elsewhere on their boards. Similarly, the founder of the [[College of William & Mary]], in 1693, was a British graduate of the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the University of Edinburgh. Cornell provided [[Stanford University]] with its [[David Starr Jordan|first president]].\n\nThe influence of these institutions on the founding of other colleges and universities is notable. This included the Southern public college movement which blossomed in the decades surrounding the turn of the 19th century when Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia established what became the flagship universities for each of these states. In 1801, a majority of the first board of trustees for what became the [[University of South Carolina]] were Princeton alumni. They appointed [[Jonathan Maxcy]], a Brown graduate, as the university's first president. [[Thomas Cooper (American politician, born 1759)|Thomas Cooper]], an Oxford alumnus and University of Pennsylvania faculty member, became the second president of the South Carolina college. The founders of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] came from Yale, hence the school colors of University of California at Berkeley are [[Yale Blue]] and California Gold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/r01_04.html |title=Resource: Student history |publisher=Resource.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909165637/http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/r01_04.html |archivedate=2010-09-09 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSome of the Ivy League schools have identifiable [[Protestant]] roots, while others were founded as non-sectarian schools. [[Church of England]] ''King's College'' broke up during the Revolution and was reformed as public nonsectarian [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]]. In the early nineteenth century, the specific purpose of training Calvinist ministers was handed off to theological seminaries, but a denominational tone and such relics as compulsory chapel often lasted well into the twentieth century. Penn and Brown were officially founded as nonsectarian schools. Brown's charter promised no religious tests and \"full liberty of conscience\", but placed control in the hands of a board of twenty-two Baptists, five Quakers, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians. Cornell has been strongly nonsectarian from its founding.\n\n\"Ivy League\" is sometimes used as a way of referring to an [[elite]] [[Social class|class]], even though institutions such as Cornell University were among the first in the United States to reject racial and gender discrimination in their admissions policies. This dates back to at least 1935.<ref>{{cite book | title=Snobbery: The American Version | first=Joseph | last=Epstein | year=2003 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | isbn=0-618-34073-4 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/snobbery00jose }} p. 55, \"by WASP Baltzell meant something much more specific; he intended to cover a select group of people who passed through a congeries of elite American institutions: certain eastern [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]], the Ivy League colleges, and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] among them.\"</ref> Novels<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite book | first = Louis | last = Auchincloss | title = East Side Story | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-618-45244-3 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | url = https://archive.org/details/eastsidestorynov00auch_0 }} p. 179, \"he dreaded the aridity of snobbery which he knew infected the Ivy League colleges\"</ref> and memoirs<ref>{{cite book | title = Project Girl | first = Janet |last = McDonald | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2000|isbn = 0-520-22345-4}} p. 163 \"''Newsweek'' is a morass of incest, nepotism, elitism, racism and utter classic white male patriarchal corruption. ...

They had always had distinguished faculties; some of the first Americans with [[doctorate]]s had taught for them; but they now decided that they could not both be world-class research institutions and be competitive in the highest ranks of American college sport; in addition, the schools experienced the scandals of any other big-time football programs, although more quietly.<ref>scandals: James Axtell, ''The Making of Princeton University'' (2006), p.274; quoting a former executive director of the Ivy League</ref>\n\n===History of the athletic league===\n[[File:Yale's four-oared crew team with 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy.jpg|thumb|Yale University's four-oared crew team, posing with the 1876 Centennial [[Regatta]] trophy.]]\n[[File:The 1879 Brown University Baseball Team.jpg|thumb|The 1879 Brown baseball varsity, with [[William Edward White|W.E.

The RAAC hosted a de facto national championship in rowing during the period 1870\u20131894. In 1895, Cornell, Columbia, and Penn founded the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]], which remains the oldest collegiate athletic organizing body in the US. To this day, the IRA Championship Regatta determines the national champion in rowing and all of the Ivies are regularly invited to compete.\n\nA basketball league was later created in 1902, when Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Yale and Princeton formed the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League]]; they were later joined by Penn and Dartmouth.\n\nIn 1906, the organization that eventually became the [[NCAA|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] was formed, primarily to formalize rules for the emerging sport of football. But of the 39 original member colleges in the NCAA, only two of them (Dartmouth and Penn) later became Ivies.\n\nIn February 1903, intercollegiate wrestling began when Yale accepted a challenge from Columbia, published in the Yale News. The dual meet took place prior to a basketball game hosted by Columbia and resulted in a tie. Two years later, Penn and Princeton also added wrestling teams, leading to the formation of the student-run Intercollegiate Wrestling Association, now the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association]] (EIWA), the first and oldest collegiate wrestling league in the US.<ref>{{cite news | title = Columbia Celebrates College Wrestling Centennial | publisher = Columbia College Today | url = http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/may03/features5.php | access-date = 2014-09-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141010054526/http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/may03/features5.php | archive-date = 2014-10-10 | url-status=dead | df =  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Penn, Princeton and Yale formed the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League]]; they were later joined by Harvard, Brown, Army and Navy.\n\nBefore the formal establishment of the Ivy League, there was an \"unwritten and unspoken agreement among certain Eastern colleges on athletic relations\". The earliest reference to the \"Ivy colleges\" came in 1933, when [[Stanley Woodward]] of the [[New York Herald Tribune]] used it to refer to the eight current members plus Army.<ref name=officialhistory/>  In 1935, the [[Associated Press]] reported on an example of collaboration between the schools:\n\n{{quote|The athletic authorities of the so-called \"Ivy League\" are considering drastic measures to curb the increasing tendency toward riotous attacks on goal posts and other encroachments by spectators on playing fields.|The Associated Press|''The New York Times''<ref>{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | title = Colleges Searching for Check On Trend to Goal Post Riots | work = The New York Times | page = 33 | date = 1935-12-06 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1935/12/06/archives/colleges-searching-for-check-on-trend-to-goal-post-riots-eastern.html}}</ref>}}\n\nDespite such collaboration, the universities did not seem to consider the formation of the league as imminent. [[Romeyn Berry]], Cornell's manager of athletics, reported the situation in January 1936 as follows:\n\n{{quote|text=I can say with certainty that in the last five years\u2014and markedly in the last three months\u2014there has been a strong drift among the eight or ten universities of the East which see a good deal of one another in sport toward a closer bond of confidence and cooperation and toward the formation of a common front against the threat of a breakdown in the ideals of amateur sport in the interests of supposed expediency.\n\nPlease do not regard that statement as implying the organization of an Eastern conference or even a poetic \"Ivy League\".

Harvard's team, \"The Oneida\", won the race and was presented with trophy black walnut oars from then-presidential nominee General [[Franklin Pierce]].\nThe proposal did not succeed\u2014on January 11, 1937, the athletic authorities at the schools rejected the \"possibility of a heptagonal league in football such as these institutions maintain in basketball, baseball and track.\" However, they noted that the league \"has such promising possibilities that it may not be dismissed and must be the subject of further consideration.\"<ref>{{cite news | title = Plea for an Ivy Football League Rejected by College Authorities | work = The New York Times | page = 26 | date = 1937-01-12}}</ref>\n\n====Post-World War II====\n[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-11-06 Tuck School of Business.JPG|thumb|Students in Stell Hall at Dartmouth's [[Tuck School of Business]], 2007]]\n[[File:Scroll and Key 1866 delegation Yale College.jpg|thumb|Students of Yale College, 1866]]\n\nIn 1945 the presidents of the eight schools signed the first ''Ivy Group Agreement'', which set academic, financial, and athletic standards for the [[American football|football]] teams. The principles established reiterated those put forward in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Presidents' Agreement of 1916. The Ivy Group Agreement established the core tenet that an applicant's ability to play on a team would not influence admissions decisions:\n\n{{quote|The members of the Group reaffirm their prohibition of athletic scholarships.

This is generally reckoned as the formal formation of the Ivy League. As part of the transition, Brown, the only Ivy that hadn't joined the EIBL, did so for the 1954\u201355 season.

MACA is a primary sponsor of the Injannashi Fund, which provides small educational grants to students in Southern Mongolia. MACA also provides small grants from time to time to cultural and educational institutions to support cultural events related to the Mongolias. In 2011, the MCADF provided a grant to assist the Wildlife Conservation Fund with its 'Trunk' program in Mongolia, which aims to educate school age children on the importance of wildlife and environment.\n\nMACA holds a [[Genghis Khan|Chinggis Qan]] ceremony annually, a continuation of the Chinggis Qan memorial held in the [[Ezen Qoroo]] region of [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]].

From 2004\u201308, the MCADF sponsored the Night Clinic operated by the [[Christina Noble]] Foundation, which provides medical services to the [[street children]] of [[Ulaanbaatar]]. MACA is a primary sponsor of the Injannashi Fund, which provides small educational grants to students in Southern Mongolia. MACA also provides small grants from time to time to cultural and educational institutions to support cultural events related to the Mongolias. In 2011, the MCADF provided a grant to assist the Wildlife Conservation Fund with its 'Trunk' program in Mongolia, which aims to educate school age children on the importance of wildlife and environment.\n\nMACA holds a [[Genghis Khan|Chinggis Qan]] ceremony annually, a continuation of the Chinggis Qan memorial held in the [[Ezen Qoroo]] region of [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]]. This ritual was started in the United States by teachers Gombojab Hangin and [[C'orj'i Lama]] in 1988, and is held annually in late fall. In 1999, to mark the 10th anniversary of the death of Professor Gombojab Hangin, a Chinggis Qan Symposium was held in his memory, which resulted in the publication of the proceedings with articles from scholars from Mongolia, Southern Mongolia, Buryatia and Kalmykia. In 2012 MACA celebrates 25 years of the ceremony in the United States.\n\nMACA is open to all individuals who share a common belief in the importance of preserving Mongol culture in the United States.\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Kassiane Asasumasu]]\n* [[Diluwa Khutugtu Jamsrangjab]]\n* [[Jamyangiin Urant\u00f6gs]]\n\n=== Buryat ===\n* [[Sergei Bodrov]]\n* [[Irina Pantaeva]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n*[[Mongolia\u2013United States relations]]\n*[[Diluwa Khutugtu Jamsrangjab]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite encyclopaedia|ref=harv|article=Mongolian Americans|pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofas00leej/page/811 811&ndash;850]|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife|volume=1|first1=Jonathan H.

{"title_page": "Speidel", "text_new": "{{for|the surname|Speidel (surname)}}\n{{more citations needed|date=February 2012}}\n'''Speidel''' is a manufacturer of [[watchband]]s and related items based in [[East Providence, Rhode Island]], [[United States]]. It was founded by Friedrich Speidel in 1867 as a manufacturer of gold and silver chains, and the company was formed in it's modern form in the United States in 1904 as 'The Speidel Chain Company'. Speidel experienced a boom in popularity, notably with their invention of the hugely popular 'expansion bands' in the mid-1930's, before beginning to decline by the end of the century with the inability to compete with cheaper products.\n\n==History==\nFriedrich Speidel founded the Speidel Company in 1867. With an initial investment equivalent to $10, Speidel started making gold and silver chains with his wife, in the basement of his home in Pforzheim, Germany. He has been credited with developing the gold-over-metal method of manufacturing called \"bi-metal\" (also incorrectly known as gold \"plating\") which proved successful. In 1896 he built the company's first factory, and installed state-of-the-art machines for the production of gold chain, previously manufactured entirely by hand.\n\nFriedrich Speidel sent his three sons, Albert, Edwin and Eugene to America to establish a branch of the family's jewelry chain manufacturing business. The Speidel Chain Company was officially founded in the United States in 1904.\n\nBy 1912 the Speidel brothers hired the architectural firm Monks and Johnson to design the company's first headquarters. The five-story building, with its European-style front, was originally called the Doran-Speidel Building. In 1912 Edwin Speidel went on to found the Automatic Chain Company, which produced neck chain, chain-by-the-foot, and watch bracelets, most of their output being sold to watch manufacturers such as Bulova.\n\nAt first, only chain was made in the new facilities. During the 1920s, costume jewelry and watchbands were added to the line. Men's watchbands surged in popularity due to their introduction and use in the military during World War I. In the early 1920s Albert Speidel formed Speidel Brothers, producing watch bracelets that were manufactured and sold primarily to wholesalers.<ref>http://www.speidel.com/default.cfm?PID=1.3.1</ref>\n\nIn 1928 the Speidel family in Germany and the brothers who lived in the United States, decided to merge all of the businesses into the Speidel Corporation in order to strengthen their position. The first president of Speidel Corporation was Albert Speidel, one of the Speidel brothers living in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1934 Paul Levinger was hired by Speidel Corporation as a plant foreman.\n\nIn 1937 Albert Speidel died at an early age from pneumonia. His brother Edwin, the founder of the Automatic Chain Company who had not been active in the Speidel Corporation up to this time became president of Speidel Corporation and Paul Levinger was made vice-president. At that time, the majority control of the business was held by the German family. However, in 1939, all of the shares held by the German stockholders were purchased by Edwin Speidel and Paul Levinger.\n\nWatchband production was cut back during World War II when Speidel converted most of its facilities and started manufacturing cathode ray tubes for radar and other electronic applications. However Speidel came back strong in watchbands as soon as peace returned. In 1947 Speidel brought out its first modernized version of the scissor-type expansion band called the Golden Knight. It proved to be a tremendous success in the men's watch bracelet field. The company also introduced elaborate packaging for its line of watch bracelets.\n\nA planned reduction of costume jewelry production was soon instituted, leading to the discontinuation of costume jewelry in the early 1950s. National advertising for watch bracelets under the name Speidel and the building of a brand name began after the end of World War II, first in magazines and then in radio with a program called \u201cStop the Music.\u201d This proved to be an outstanding success and helped make the name of Speidel nationally known. In 1949 Speidel changed with the times and discontinued radio advertising. Instead it concentrated its advertising budget in television, purchasing a number of fully sponsored programs and making Speidel one of the earliest television advertisers in the United States.\n\nIn 1951 with the advent of the Korean War, Speidel began manufacturing identification bracelets. The first product in this category was the Photo Ident, a combination ident bracelet with photo and an expandable wristband, which was advertised on television. It was an immediate success \u2013 of major proportions.\n\nIn 1956 Speidel started manufacturing men's jewelry. The goal was to diversify its inventory and combat the increasingly heavy competition in metal watch bracelets from Japanese imports. Heavy opposition to this move by other manufacturers made it necessary for Speidel to change its method of distribution from general jobbers to sole distributors. Over the next three years a number of such sole distributorships were established in strategic geographic locations. Its sales force was also built up to provide adequate coverage to all areas of the United States.\n\nAround this time, heavy investments had been made in the development of automatic equipment to produce a bracelet similar to the German Fixo-Flex. A few years earlier a German manufacturer had sent the first version of the Fixo-Flex bracelet to Paul Levinger who had worked out a license contract with the inventor, Karl E. Stiegle. In 1956 the first automatically produced bracelet under this patent was introduced as a test under the name of Kingsway. By 1959 the company officially introduced the new watchband as the \u201cTwist-O-Flex\u201d.\n\nBy 1964 the company, now owned by Paul Levinger, had grown significantly both in size and importance to the jewelry industry. Levinger sold the company to Textron, Inc. in May of that year. By 1966 Speidel had expanded its distribution capacity and entered the men's toiletries market, with the introduction of the men's fragrance British Sterling. The company aggressively marketed the product with such enduring phrases as, \u201cMake him a legend in his own time,\u201d which helped to create a market success without parallel. Speidel became one of Textron's top local divisions \nin sales volume and performance.\n\nThe company began to expand its marketing reach internationally in the 1970s, beginning with Canada in 1971. The company furthered its sales market by branching out to Australia and New Zealand in 1972. Great Britain and Ireland in 1973; and Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland in 1974.\n\nIn the midst of their international sales expansion, Speidel started OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturing) Business Supplies in 1972. OEM manufactured metal watchbands directly for watch companies such as Seiko, which at the time had just introduced the \u201cquartz\u201d watch, the first totally machine assembled timepiece, which dramatically reduced watch prices. That same year Speidel began its watchband replacement program for mass merchandisers, making it much easier for consumers to find the appropriately sized watchband replacement at their local store.\n\nSpeidel introduced its newest version of the highly successful Twist-O-Flex watchband in 1988, called the Euro-Flex. The new watchband incorporated heavier metals and contemporary European styling. Speidel continued to expand its line of products with the introduction of the \u201cSignet\u201d watch line in 1994; a patented plastic top shell watchband in 1995; and the first watchband with rubberized coating in 1996.\n\nIn 1997 Textron sold Speidel to the Austrian-based Hirsch Armbaender AG, the leading manufacturer of leather watchbands in Europe. The new company was Hirsch Speidel Inc. Two years later, as part of a global manufacturing consolidation strategy, Hirsh closed Speidel's original Ship Street property and relocated its headquarters to East Providence. In coordination with the move, Speidel closed down its manufacturing operations and outsourced its workload. A portion of the production continued in Rhode Island with local manufacturing companies, and the balance moved overseas.\n\nIn 2002 the company's ownership had once again returned to the United States, when JRM holdings bought Speidel from Hirsch Armbaender. Five years later Fred Levinger acquired Speidel. In 2009 Cerce Capital LLC, purchased Speidel's assets for $US 1.65 million in a bankruptcy proceedings.<ref>[http://www.idexonline.com/FullArticle?id=32798 \"Speidel Assets Sold for $1.65 Million,\" Michelle Graf, Idexonline.com, from National Jeweler Network], accessed 2 Feb 2018</ref>\n\n==Products==\nSpeidel began as a jewelry maker in 1904, but very soon it was known for \"Ratchet-buckle\" watchbands (introduced in 1920), the \"Scissors Action Expansion Band\" (introduced in 1936), the ladies' \"Mignon\" watchbands (introduced in 1939), plus costume jewelry. In the 1930s, Speidel was the first company in the world to introduce ID bracelets. During [[World War II]], the company briefly produced [[Cathode ray tube|cathode-ray tubes]]. In addition to watchbands, Speidel produces [[wristwatch]]es, [[lighter]]s, writing instruments, small jewelry, and other accessories.

Speidel introduced the Twist-O-Flex in 1959, after licensing the technology from its German inventor, Karl E. Stiegele. The Speidel logo is a Twist-O-Flex watchband tied into a bow.\n\nThe \"Twist-O-Flex\" consists of various styles of metal bracelet watchbands; the special link design creates a single-component, stretchable bracelet (also called an \"extension bracelet\" and once known as a \"scissor-link\" bracelet).\n\nThe Twist-O-Flex started life as a bracelet similar to the German \"Fixo-Flex\". A few years earlier, a German manufacturer had sent the first version of the \"Fixo-Flex\" bracelet to Paul Levinger, who had worked out a license contract with the inventor, Karl E. Stiegle.\n\nIn 1956 the first automatically produced bracelet under this patent was introduced under the name of \"Kingsway\". By 1959 the company officially introduced the new watchband as the \u201cTwist-O-Flex\u201d. This watch band was and is considered light years ahead of any other watchband products, was a sales phenomenon and was the fashion statement of its time.\n\nThe company's independent distributorships, such as Gluck, GKG, Gerwe Brown, and Simon Golub became enormously profitable due to the Twist-O-Flex watchbands. Speidel went on to introduce two other highly popular versions of the Twist-O-Flex: the Ladies Twist-O-Flex introduced in 1961 and the Youth Twist-O-Flex in 1963.\n\nThe Twist-O-Flex continues to be the company's most popular product. The Twist-O-Flex was popularly called the \"tank track\" due to its resemblance to the tread of a tank when laid flat.

With an initial investment equivalent to $10, Speidel started making gold and silver chains with his wife, in the basement of his home in Pforzheim, Germany. He has been credited with developing the gold-over-metal method of manufacturing called \"bi-metal\" (also incorrectly known as gold \"plating\") which proved successful. In 1896 he built the company's first factory, and installed state-of-the-art machines for the production of gold chain, previously manufactured entirely by hand.\n\nFriedrich Speidel sent his three sons, Albert, Edwin and Eugene to America to establish a branch of the family's jewelry chain manufacturing business. The Speidel Chain Company was officially founded in the United States in 1904.\n\nBy 1912 the Speidel brothers hired the architectural firm Monks and Johnson to design the company's first headquarters. The five-story building, with its European-style front, was originally called the Doran-Speidel Building. In 1912 Edwin Speidel went on to found the Automatic Chain Company, which produced neck chain, chain-by-the-foot, and watch bracelets, most of their output being sold to watch manufacturers such as Bulova.\n\nAt first, only chain was made in the new facilities. During the 1920s, costume jewelry and watchbands were added to the line. Men's watchbands surged in popularity due to their introduction and use in the military during World War I. In the early 1920s Albert Speidel formed Speidel Brothers, producing watch bracelets that were manufactured and sold primarily to wholesalers.<ref>http://www.speidel.com/default.cfm?PID=1.3.1</ref>\n\nIn 1928 the Speidel family in Germany and the brothers who lived in the United States, decided to merge all of the businesses into the Speidel Corporation in order to strengthen their position. The first president of Speidel Corporation was Albert Speidel, one of the Speidel brothers living in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1934 Paul Levinger was hired by Speidel Corporation as a plant foreman.\n\nIn 1937 Albert Speidel died at an early age from pneumonia. His brother Edwin, the founder of the Automatic Chain Company who had not been active in the Speidel Corporation up to this time became president of Speidel Corporation and Paul Levinger was made vice-president. At that time, the majority control of the business was held by the German family. However, in 1939, all of the shares held by the German stockholders were purchased by Edwin Speidel and Paul Levinger.\n\nWatchband production was cut back during World War II when Speidel converted most of its facilities and started manufacturing cathode ray tubes for radar and other electronic applications. However Speidel came back strong in watchbands as soon as peace returned. In 1947 Speidel brought out its first modernized version of the scissor-type expansion band called the Golden Knight. It proved to be a tremendous success in the men's watch bracelet field. The company also introduced elaborate packaging for its line of watch bracelets.\n\nA planned reduction of costume jewelry production was soon instituted, leading to the discontinuation of costume jewelry in the early 1950s. National advertising for watch bracelets under the name Speidel and the building of a brand name began after the end of World War II, first in magazines and then in radio with a program called \u201cStop the Music.\u201d This proved to be an outstanding success and helped make the name of Speidel nationally known. In 1949 Speidel changed with the times and discontinued radio advertising. Instead it concentrated its advertising budget in television, purchasing a number of fully sponsored programs and making Speidel one of the earliest television advertisers in the United States.\n\nIn 1951 with the advent of the Korean War, Speidel began manufacturing identification bracelets. The first product in this category was the Photo Ident, a combination ident bracelet with photo and an expandable wristband, which was advertised on television. It was an immediate success \u2013 of major proportions.\n\nIn 1956 Speidel started manufacturing men's jewelry. The goal was to diversify its inventory and combat the increasingly heavy competition in metal watch bracelets from Japanese imports. Heavy opposition to this move by other manufacturers made it necessary for Speidel to change its method of distribution from general jobbers to sole distributors. Over the next three years a number of such sole distributorships were established in strategic geographic locations. Its sales force was also built up to provide adequate coverage to all areas of the United States.\n\nAround this time, heavy investments had been made in the development of automatic equipment to produce a bracelet similar to the German Fixo-Flex. A few years earlier a German manufacturer had sent the first version of the Fixo-Flex bracelet to Paul Levinger who had worked out a license contract with the inventor, Karl E. Stiegle. In 1956 the first automatically produced bracelet under this patent was introduced as a test under the name of Kingsway. By 1959 the company officially introduced the new watchband as the \u201cTwist-O-Flex\u201d.\n\nBy 1964 the company, now owned by Paul Levinger, had grown significantly both in size and importance to the jewelry industry. Levinger sold the company to Textron, Inc. in May of that year. By 1966 Speidel had expanded its distribution capacity and entered the men's toiletries market, with the introduction of the men's fragrance British Sterling. The company aggressively marketed the product with such enduring phrases as, \u201cMake him a legend in his own time,\u201d which helped to create a market success without parallel. Speidel became one of Textron's top local divisions \nin sales volume and performance.\n\nThe company began to expand its marketing reach internationally in the 1970s, beginning with Canada in 1971. The company furthered its sales market by branching out to Australia and New Zealand in 1972. Great Britain and Ireland in 1973; and Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland in 1974.\n\nIn the midst of their international sales expansion, Speidel started OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturing) Business Supplies in 1972. OEM manufactured metal watchbands directly for watch companies such as Seiko, which at the time had just introduced the \u201cquartz\u201d watch, the first totally machine assembled timepiece, which dramatically reduced watch prices. That same year Speidel began its watchband replacement program for mass merchandisers, making it much easier for consumers to find the appropriately sized watchband replacement at their local store.\n\nSpeidel introduced its newest version of the highly successful Twist-O-Flex watchband in 1988, called the Euro-Flex. The new watchband incorporated heavier metals and contemporary European styling. Speidel continued to expand its line of products with the introduction of the \u201cSignet\u201d watch line in 1994; a patented plastic top shell watchband in 1995; and the first watchband with rubberized coating in 1996.\n\nIn 1997 Textron sold Speidel to the Austrian-based Hirsch Armbaender AG, the leading manufacturer of leather watchbands in Europe. The new company was Hirsch Speidel Inc. Two years later, as part of a global manufacturing consolidation strategy, Hirsh closed Speidel's original Ship Street property and relocated its headquarters to East Providence. In coordination with the move, Speidel closed down its manufacturing operations and outsourced its workload. A portion of the production continued in Rhode Island with local manufacturing companies, and the balance moved overseas.\n\nIn 2002 the company's ownership had once again returned to the United States, when JRM holdings bought Speidel from Hirshc Armbaender. Five years later Fred Levinger acquired Speidel. In 2009 Cerce Capital LLC, purchased Speidel's assets for $US 1.65 million in a bankruptcy proceedings.<ref>[http://www.idexonline.com/FullArticle?id=32798 \"Speidel Assets Sold for $1.65 Million,\" Michelle Graf, Idexonline.com, from National Jeweler Network], accessed 2 Feb 2018</ref>\n\n==Products==\nSpeidel began as a jewelry maker in 1904, but very soon it was known for \"Ratchet-buckle\" watchbands (introduced in 1920), the \"Scissors Action Expansion Band\" (introduced in 1936), the ladies' \"Mignon\" watchbands (introduced in 1939), plus costume jewelry. In the 1930s, Speidel was the first company in the world to introduce ID bracelets. During [[World War II]], the company briefly produced [[Cathode ray tube|cathode-ray tubes]]. In addition to watchbands, Speidel produces [[wristwatch]]es, [[lighter]]s, writing instruments, small jewelry, and other accessories.

These include local, international, direct-to-video and TV releases, and (in certain cases) online releases. They include their scores on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the region in which they were released (for foreign adaptations), approximate budget, their approximate box office revenue (for theatrical releases), distributor of the film, and the publisher of the original game at the time the film was made (this means that publishers may change between two adaptations of the same game or game series, such as ''[[Mortal Kombat]]''). Also included are short films, cutscene films (made up of cutscenes and cinematics from the actual games), documentaries with video games as their subjects and films in which video games play a large part (such as ''[[Tron]]'' or ''[[WarGames]]''). \n\nFilms based on video games have often received negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes's 2019 list titled ''Video Game Movies Ranked Worst to Best'' included only 3 films that received a fresh Tomatometer rating.{{efn|name=RTRanking|Rotten Tomatoes only included theatrically-released films with Tomatometer scores based on more than 20 reviews.}}<ref name= VideoGameRottenTomatoes>{{cite web |title=43 VIDEO GAME MOVIES RANKED WORST TO BEST |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/video-game-movies-ranked-worst-to-best/ |accessdate=August 20, 2019 |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n\n==Theatrical releases==\n\n===Hollywood (live-action)===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!
