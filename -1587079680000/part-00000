They are typically around {{convert|17|-|20|mm|1|abbr=on}} long. Nests are mainly built in exposed places far off the ground, like on tree limbs, under cliff overhangs, and sometimes on buildings. These social bees are known for their aggressive defense strategies and vicious behavior when disturbed. Though not domesticating it, indigenous peoples have traditionally used this species as a source of [[honey]] and [[beeswax]], a practice known as [[honey hunting]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Starr|first1=Christoper|title=Nest-site Preferences of the Giant Honey Bee, Apis dorsata (Hymeoptera:Apidae), in Borneo|journal=Pan-Pacific Entomologist|date=1987|issue=63|pages=37\u201342}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\n''Apis dorsata'' belongs to the family [[Apidae]], which is in the class [[Insecta]]. This honeybee is most closely related to ''Apis mellifera'', (the [[western honey bee]]) ''Apis cerana'', and ''Apis florea''. ''Apis dorsata'' belongs to the subgenus ''Megapis''.

Each colony consists of a single vertical comb made of workers\u2019 wax suspended from above, and the comb is typically covered by a dense mass of bees in several layers. The nests are mostly conical in shape and vary in size, reaching up to 1 meter in width. Each cell within the comb is hexagonal in shape. ''Apis dorsata'' store their honey in an upper corner of the nest. The same size and type of cells are used to rear larvae.<ref name=gorkha>{{cite journal|last1=Neupane|first1=K.R.|title=Nesting behavior of Giant honey bee (Apis dorsata)|date=2005|url=http://www.gorkhabee.com/nesting-behavior-giant-honey-bee-apis-dorsata|accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> Nests are constructed in the open and in elevated locations, such as on urban buildings or tall trees.

In the [[Philippines]], which used to have one of the greatest populations of ''Apis dorsata'', the populations have now become relatively rare due to deforestation and people's \"mindsets\" towards the bees.{{explain|date=August 2018}} They mostly reside in tall trees in dense forests, but also build nests on urban buildings. These bees are tropical and in most places, they migrate seasonally. Individual colonies migrate between nesting sites during the transition from the rainy to dry seasons and occupy each nesting site for about 3\u20134 months at a time. Some recent evidence indicates these bees return to the same nest site, though most, if not all, of the original workers might be replaced in the process because workers usually live for less than two months.<ref name=\"three\"/> Furthermore, these bees build small combs that serve as temporary nests during their long migrations.\n\nIn Bornean rainforests, ''[[Apis koschevnikovi]]'' and ''Apis dorsata'' are the only honeybees that appear frequently at flowering canopy trees or baits.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|publisher = Springer New York|date = 2005-01-01|isbn = 978-0-387-21309-5|pages = 89\u2013103|series = Ecological Studies|doi = 10.1007/0-387-27161-9_8|first = David W.|last = Roubik|editor-first = David W.|editor-last = Roubik|editor-first2 = Shoko|editor-last2 = Sakai|editor-first3 = Abang A.

The colony was being formed at the time of taking this image. Note the multiple layers of bees on top of each other.]]\nThere are two methods of reproductive [[swarming]] in which ''Apis dorsata'' initiates new colonies, which usually occurs in October or November. The most common occurs when a queen flies away from the original nest slowly and a swarm of workers follows her.<ref name=two/> This new cluster of bees can be temporary, or they can permanently move to a new nesting site. The distance these bees travel is unknown, but some have been observed to travel about 500 meters away from the original nest. The second, more rare method is referred to as \u201c[[budding]].\u201d<ref name=two/> In budding, a group of workers leave the natal nest to form a new colony at a nesting site about 1 meter away from the original.\n\nA non-reproductive method of colony initiation is absconding. [[Swarming (honey bee)|Absconding]] refers to when an entire colony moves to a new location.<ref name=seven>{{cite journal|last1=Reddy|first1=Chandrasekhara|title=Rates of swarming and absconding in the giant honey bee, Apis dorsata F.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, India|date=1989|volume=8|issue=6|pages=425\u2013430|doi=10.1007/bf03179655}}</ref> As a colony is formed, multiple curtains, essentially layers, of bees are formed around the developing nest.<ref name=\"four\"/>\nColony initiation is related to the migratory patterns of these bees.\n\n===Colony migration and decline===\nAs a colony is initiated, the migration depends on foraging resources and predation risks. These bees travel to different sites depending on the blooming season of flowers.<ref name=twelve>{{cite journal|last1=Dyer|first1=F.C.|title=Colony Migration in the tropical honey bee Apis dorsata F.

This is called [[nuptial flight]]. The [[drone (bee)|drone]] flights are comparatively shorter than those of other [[Asia]]n honeybee species. The ''Apis dorsata'' flights occur around dusk for 13 minutes on average.<ref name=one>{{cite journal|last1=Moritz|first1=Robin|title=High degree of polyandry in Apis dorsata queens detected by DNA micro satellite variability|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=1995|volume=37|issue=5|pages=357\u2013363|doi=10.1007/bf00174141}}</ref> ''Apis dorsata'' exhibit high degrees of [[polyandry]], with many drones mating with the queen.

During mating, the drones fly to \u201cdrone congregation areas\u201d (DCAs).<ref name=three/> There is sufficient evidence to conclude that each aggregation has its own DCA since there is more genetic relatedness within aggregations and because of the short duration and distance traveled during the mating flight.<ref name=three/>\n\n===Communication===\n''Apis dorsata'' utilizes what is known as a dance language, also known as [[waggle dance]], to communicate the location of food sources to other bees in the colony. The dance language indicates the distance, profitability, and direction of the food source.<ref name=nine>{{cite journal|last1=Kirchner|first1=Wolfgang|title=Acoustic signals in the dance language of the giant honeybee, Apis dorsata|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=1993|volume=33|issue=2|pages=67\u201372|doi=10.1007/bf00171657}}</ref> These social bees dance in the open and their dances produce sound signals of high intensity in the air. The orientation of the dancer\u2019s body points in the direction of the food source; the frequency of the sound indicates the profitability of the food source.<ref name=nine/> ''Apis dorsata'' produces silent dances, which usually involve visual cues during the day. They additionally produce sound with their dances in the nighttime, as they are the only bees of its [[genus]] that exhibit [[nocturnal]] foraging activity.<ref name=nine/> Furthermore, there is some evidence that ''Apis dorsata'' dances for [[Insect migration|migration]] purposes as well. Bees that have returned from the new nesting site perform dances that alert the colony of information such as the direction of the new nesting site.<ref name= twelve/>\n\n==Kin selection==\n\n===Worker policing===\nUnlike the rearing patterns of other species of the genus ''[[Apis (genus)|Apis]]'', the worker and drone brood of ''Apis dorsata'' are dispersed across in the same area and even share cells, and are not differentiated in separate locations of the nest.<ref name=sixteen>{{cite journal|last1=Wattanachaiyingcharoen|first1=W.|title=Lack of worker reproduction in the giant honey bee \"Apis dorsata\" Fabricius|journal=Insectes Sociaux|date=2002|volume=49|pages=82\u201385|doi=10.1007/s00040-002-8283-1}}</ref> It would seem that [[worker policing]] makes mistakes often in correctly removing the drone brood since the drone brood are interspersed with worker brood, but every male raised comes from a queen-laid egg (not a worker-laid egg). This shows us that [[worker policing]] does indeed work within populations of these bees. In these instances, worker policing occurs through \u201cegg-eating\u201d or [[oophagy]], but in the case of these bees, worker policing is directed at workers with [[ovaries]] since oophagy is hard to achieve, as worker-laid and queen-laid eggs are nearly identical in shape and size.<ref name=\"sixteen\"/>\n\n===Genetic relatedness within and between aggregations===\nSince ''Apis dorsata'' is known for its highly [[polyandrous]] activity, these bees exhibit a large number of colonies in close proximity to each other. Although the colonies within an aggregation are near each other, these colonies are not closely related. The queens of the colonies in an aggregation are not closely related, but the aggregation itself is more genetically linked than is expected by chance. Higher than expected genetic links may exist among colonies because they migrate together during their long distance migratory routes to the same nesting sites in the new location. This may also be attributed to short distance reproductive swarming methods and brief mating periods as well. Since it has been observed that rarely any queen-daughter relationships exist within aggregations, the \u201cbudding\u201d hypothesis of colony initiation rarely occurs.<ref name=two>{{cite journal|last1=Oldroyd|first1=B.P.|title=Colony relatedness in aggregations of Apis dorsata Fabricius (Hymenoptera, Apidae)|journal=Insectes Sociaux|date=1998|volume=47|pages=94\u201395|doi=10.1007/s000400050015}}</ref> Due to their long distance migratory patterns, the bees cause enough [[gene flow]] to occur between the colonies of different aggregations.<ref name=three/> There is distinct genetic differentiation between aggregations. In turn, the genetic relatedness between colonies within a single aggregation decreases.\n\n===Nest recognition and fidelity===\n''Apis dorsata'' is better than many of its relatives at avoiding drifting, an event when bees return to the wrong colonies after foraging.<ref name=four>{{cite journal|last1=Paar|first1=Jurgen|title=Drifting of workers in nest aggregations of the giant honeybee Apis dorsata|journal=Apidologie|date=2002|volume=33|issue=6|pages=553\u2013561|doi=10.1051/apido:2002040|doi-access=free}}</ref> ''Apis dorsata'' tends to form dense aggregations, contributing to the high nest fidelity and recognition amongst these bees. These bees usually return to their natal nests because this behavior results in higher fitness. If drifting were common, [[robbing]] bees and parasites could spread quickly through colonies. The high fidelity to the natal nests also leads to the aggressive behavior of ''Apis dorsata'' bees. They aggressively attack workers from colonies that aren\u2019t their own.<ref name=\"four\"/> If workers and queens do not return to the same colony, they have a high chance of getting killed because the other colony views them as potential robbers or carriers of disease. Some colonies even return to exactly the same nesting sites after their seasonal migrations.<ref name=three/>\n\n==Interactions with other species==\n[[File:Gaint Honey Bee (Apis dorsata) on Tribulus terrestris W IMG 1020.jpg|thumb|''Apis dorsata'' on ''[[Tribulus terrestris]]'' in [[Hyderabad, India]]]]\n\n===Parasites===\nSimilar to other honeybees, ''Apis dorsata'' is regularly attacked by parasitic mites. The parasitic mite known to attack ''Apis dorsata'' is ''[[Tropilaelaps|Tropilaelaps clareae]]''. ''Tropilaelaps clareae'' needs brood in order to reproduce and are found in adult brood males of the colony. ''Apis dorsata'' is thought to be the original host of this parasite.<ref name=eleven>{{cite journal|last1=Buchler|first1=Ralph|title=Grooming Behaviour of Apis cerana, Apis mellifera and Apis dorsata and its effect on the parasitic mites Varroa jacobsoni and Tropilaelaps clareae|journal=Experimental and Applied Acarology|date=1992|volume=16|issue=4|pages=313\u2013319|doi=10.1007/bf01218573}}</ref> If ''Apis dorsata'' engages in brood-less migration, then the entire colony can reduce infestation by this parasitic mite.<ref name=three/> Although quite rare, some experimental evidence has shown that ''Apis dorsata'' exhibits a specialized grooming behavior as a defense mechanism to remove parasites.<ref name=\"eleven\"/> The grooming behavior involves intense shaking of the body and auto-grooming with the legs.<ref name=\"eleven\"/>\n\n===Defense against predators===\nSince the nests of ''Apis dorsata'' are fairly exposed and accessible to predators, these giant honeybees exhibit strong and aggressive defense strategies. Their predators include [[wasps]], [[hornets]], [[birds]], and human bee-hunters. Their defense strategies typically include physical contact, especially when they face attacks from wasps. These giant honeybees utilize a method called \u201cheat balling,\u201d in which they heat their thoraces to a temperature of 45 degrees Celsius (which is lethal to wasps.)<ref name=nih>{{cite journal|last1=Kastberger|first1=Gerald|title=Social Waves in Giant Honeybees Repel Hornets|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2008|volume=3|issue=9|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003141|pmid=18781205|pmc=2528003|pages=e3141|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.3141K}}</ref>\n\nAnother method that ''Apis dorsata'' utilizes against wasps is referred to as \u201cshimmering\u201d behavior or defense waving.<ref name=nih/> Bees in the outer layer thrust their abdomens 90\u00b0 in an upward direction and shake them in a synchronous way. This may be accompanied by stroking of the wings. The signal is transmitted to nearby workers that also adopt the posture, thus creating a visible \u2014 and audible \u2014 \"ripple\" effect across the face of the comb, in an almost identical manner to an [[Wave (audience)|audience wave]] at a crowded stadium. These wave-like patterns repel wasps that get too close to the nests of these bees and serve to confuse the wasp. In turn, the wasp cannot fixate on capturing one bee or getting food from the bees\u2019 nest, so the wasp will seek to find easier prey and leave this nest alone.<ref name=nih/> Shimmering appears to be an evolutionary successful behavior for group living amongst social bees.\n\nStudies have also provided evidence that these bee colonies aggregate in defense. If one part of the nest is directly threatened by a bird, a signal (still unknown as to how) gets relayed to the rest of the colony so that all of them help in the defense, even if they are not directly threatened.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=LK|title=The predator-prey interaction between blue-bearded bee eaters (Nyctornis athertoni Jardine and Selby 1830) and giant honeybees (Apis dorsata Fabricius 1798)|journal=Apidologie|date=2000|volume=31|issue=6|pages=727\u2013736|doi=10.1051/apido:2000157|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Human importance===\nThis [[genus]] has a long history with humankind. Cave paintings of these bees have been found in [[Valencia]], [[Spain]] that date back to the [[Paleolithic]] era (suspicious, as Valencia is well away from the Apis dorsata range; probably some other Apis species). In modern times, since large amounts of [[honey]] (up to 45 kilograms) can be stored in the nests of ''Apis dorsata'', many people frequently harvest their nests. Honey represents a livelihood for some of these people as it can provide them with an important source of income.<ref name=three/> However, [[deforestation]], [[urbanization]], [[pesticides]], and honey hunting have threatened local populations of bees and their honey. These bees are known to be aggressive, and they have the potential to viciously sting humans.<ref name=fifteen/> In fact, they are known as \u201cHejjenu\u201d in [[Karnataka]], [[India]] due to their aggressive behavior, large colonies, and painful stings.<ref name=fifteen/> At least one fatal defensive attack on a human has been reported.<ref>{{cite news |title=Death of man stung by bees ruled accidental|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/death-man-stung-bees-ruled-accidental-20140429 |work=[[The Straits Times]] |date=April 29, 2014 |accessdate=April 30, 2014 |first=Elena |last=Chong}}</ref>\n\n====Rafter beekeeping====\n[[File:Rafter beekeeping of Apis dorsata.jpg|thumb|left|Rafter beekeeping technique used with ''A. dorsata'']]\nIn some  ''[[Melaleuca]]'' forests of southern [[Vietnam]], people use a traditional method of collecting honey and wax from ''A. dorsata'' colonies.

Each colony consists of a single vertical comb made of workers\u2019 wax suspended from above, and the comb is typically covered by a dense mass of bees in several layers. The nests are mostly conical in shape and vary in size, reaching up to 1 meter in width. Each cell within the comb is hexagonal in shape. ''Apis dorsata'' store their honey in an upper corner of the nest. The same size and type of cells are used to rear larvae.<ref name=gorkha>{{cite journal|last1=Neupane|first1=K.R.|title=Nesting behavior of Giant honey bee (Apis dorsata)|date=2005|url=http://www.gorkhabee.com/nesting-behavior-giant-honey-bee-apis-dorsata|accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref> Nests are constructed in the open and in elevated locations, such as on urban buildings or tall trees.

In the [[Philippines]], which used to have one of the greatest populations of ''Apis dorsata'', the populations have now become relatively rare due to deforestation and people's \"mindsets\" towards the bees.{{explain|date=August 2018}} They mostly reside in tall trees in dense forests, but also build nests on urban buildings. These bees are tropical and in most places, they migrate seasonally. Individual colonies migrate between nesting sites during the transition from the rainy to dry seasons and occupy each nesting site for about 3\u20134 months at a time. Some recent evidence indicates these bees return to the same nest site, though most, if not all, of the original workers might be replaced in the process because workers usually live for less than two months.<ref name=\"three\"/> Furthermore, these bees build small combs that serve as temporary nests during their long migrations.\n\nIn Bornean rainforests, ''[[Apis koschevnikovi]]'' and ''Apis dorsata'' are the only honeybees that appear frequently at flowering canopy trees or baits.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|publisher = Springer New York|date = 2005-01-01|isbn = 978-0-387-21309-5|pages = 89\u2013103|series = Ecological Studies|doi = 10.1007/0-387-27161-9_8|first = David W.|last = Roubik|editor-first = David W.|editor-last = Roubik|editor-first2 = Shoko|editor-last2 = Sakai|editor-first3 = Abang A.

The colony was being formed at the time of taking this image. Note the multiple layers of bees on top of each other.]]\nThere are two methods of reproductive [[swarming]] in which ''Apis dorsata'' initiates new colonies, which usually occurs in October or November. The most common occurs when a queen flies away from the original nest slowly and a swarm of workers follows her.<ref name=two/> This new cluster of bees can be temporary, or they can permanently move to a new nesting site. The distance these bees travel is unknown, but some have been observed to travel about 500 meters away from the original nest. The second, more rare method is referred to as \u201c[[budding]].\u201d<ref name=two/> In budding, a group of workers leave the natal nest to form a new colony at a nesting site about 1 meter away from the original.\n\nA non-reproductive method of colony initiation is absconding. [[Swarming (honey bee)|Absconding]] refers to when an entire colony moves to a new location.<ref name=seven>{{cite journal|last1=Reddy|first1=Chandrasekhara|title=Rates of swarming and absconding in the giant honey bee, Apis dorsata F.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, India|date=1989|volume=8|issue=6|pages=425\u2013430|doi=10.1007/bf03179655}}</ref> As a colony is formed, multiple curtains, essentially layers, of bees are formed around the developing nest.<ref name=\"four\"/>\nColony initiation is related to the migratory patterns of these bees.\n\n===Colony migration and decline===\nAs a colony is initiated, the migration depends on foraging resources and predation risks. These bees travel to different sites depending on the blooming season of flowers.<ref name=twelve>{{cite journal|last1=Dyer|first1=F.C.|title=Colony Migration in the tropical honey bee Apis dorsata F.

This is called nuptial flight. The [[drone (bee)|drone]] flights are comparatively shorter than those of other [[Asia]]n honeybee species. The ''Apis dorsata'' flights occur around dusk for 13 minutes on average.<ref name=one>{{cite journal|last1=Moritz|first1=Robin|title=High degree of polyandry in Apis dorsata queens detected by DNA micro satellite variability|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=1995|volume=37|issue=5|pages=357\u2013363|doi=10.1007/bf00174141}}</ref> ''Apis dorsata'' exhibit high degrees of [[polyandry]], with many drones mating with the queen.

During mating, the drones fly to \u201cdrone congregation areas\u201d (DCAs).<ref name=three/> There is sufficient evidence to conclude that each aggregation has its own DCA since there is more genetic relatedness within aggregations and because of the short duration and distance traveled during the mating flight.<ref name=three/>\n\n===Communication===\n''Apis dorsata'' utilizes what is known as a dance language, also known as [[waggle dance]], to communicate the location of food sources to other bees in the colony. The dance language indicates the distance, profitability, and direction of the food source.<ref name=nine>{{cite journal|last1=Kirchner|first1=Wolfgang|title=Acoustic signals in the dance language of the giant honeybee, Apis dorsata|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=1993|volume=33|issue=2|pages=67\u201372|doi=10.1007/bf00171657}}</ref> These social bees dance in the open and their dances produce sound signals of high intensity in the air. The orientation of the dancer\u2019s body points in the direction of the food source; the frequency of the sound indicates the profitability of the food source.<ref name=nine/> ''Apis dorsata'' produces silent dances, which usually involve visual cues during the day. They additionally produce sound with their dances in the nighttime, as they are the only bees of its [[genus]] that exhibit [[nocturnal]] foraging activity.<ref name=nine/> Furthermore, there is some evidence that ''Apis dorsata'' dances for [[Insect migration|migration]] purposes as well. Bees that have returned from the new nesting site perform dances that alert the colony of information such as the direction of the new nesting site.<ref name= twelve/>\n\n==Kin selection==\n\n===Worker policing===\nUnlike the rearing patterns of other species of the genus ''[[Apis (genus)|Apis]]'', the worker and drone brood of ''Apis dorsata'' are dispersed across in the same area and even share cells, and are not differentiated in separate locations of the nest.<ref name=sixteen>{{cite journal|last1=Wattanachaiyingcharoen|first1=W.|title=Lack of worker reproduction in the giant honey bee \"Apis dorsata\" Fabricius|journal=Insectes Sociaux|date=2002|volume=49|pages=82\u201385|doi=10.1007/s00040-002-8283-1}}</ref> It would seem that [[worker policing]] makes mistakes often in correctly removing the drone brood since the drone brood are interspersed with worker brood, but every male raised comes from a queen-laid egg (not a worker-laid egg). This shows us that [[worker policing]] does indeed work within populations of these bees. In these instances, worker policing occurs through \u201cegg-eating\u201d or [[oophagy]], but in the case of these bees, worker policing is directed at workers with [[ovaries]] since oophagy is hard to achieve, as worker-laid and queen-laid eggs are nearly identical in shape and size.<ref name=\"sixteen\"/>\n\n===Genetic relatedness within and between aggregations===\nSince ''Apis dorsata'' is known for its highly [[polyandrous]] activity, these bees exhibit a large number of colonies in close proximity to each other. Although the colonies within an aggregation are near each other, these colonies are not closely related. The queens of the colonies in an aggregation are not closely related, but the aggregation itself is more genetically linked than is expected by chance. Higher than expected genetic links may exist among colonies because they migrate together during their long distance migratory routes to the same nesting sites in the new location. This may also be attributed to short distance reproductive swarming methods and brief mating periods as well. Since it has been observed that rarely any queen-daughter relationships exist within aggregations, the \u201cbudding\u201d hypothesis of colony initiation rarely occurs.<ref name=two>{{cite journal|last1=Oldroyd|first1=B.P.|title=Colony relatedness in aggregations of Apis dorsata Fabricius (Hymenoptera, Apidae)|journal=Insectes Sociaux|date=1998|volume=47|pages=94\u201395|doi=10.1007/s000400050015}}</ref> Due to their long distance migratory patterns, the bees cause enough [[gene flow]] to occur between the colonies of different aggregations.<ref name=three/> There is distinct genetic differentiation between aggregations. In turn, the genetic relatedness between colonies within a single aggregation decreases.\n\n===Nest recognition and fidelity===\n''Apis dorsata'' is better than many of its relatives at avoiding drifting, an event when bees return to the wrong colonies after foraging.<ref name=four>{{cite journal|last1=Paar|first1=Jurgen|title=Drifting of workers in nest aggregations of the giant honeybee Apis dorsata|journal=Apidologie|date=2002|volume=33|issue=6|pages=553\u2013561|doi=10.1051/apido:2002040|doi-access=free}}</ref> ''Apis dorsata'' tends to form dense aggregations, contributing to the high nest fidelity and recognition amongst these bees. These bees usually return to their natal nests because this behavior results in higher fitness. If drifting were common, [[robbing]] bees and parasites could spread quickly through colonies. The high fidelity to the natal nests also leads to the aggressive behavior of ''Apis dorsata'' bees. They aggressively attack workers from colonies that aren\u2019t their own.<ref name=\"four\"/> If workers and queens do not return to the same colony, they have a high chance of getting killed because the other colony views them as potential robbers or carriers of disease. Some colonies even return to exactly the same nesting sites after their seasonal migrations.<ref name=three/>\n\n==Interactions with other species==\n[[File:Gaint Honey Bee (Apis dorsata) on Tribulus terrestris W IMG 1020.jpg|thumb|''Apis dorsata'' on ''[[Tribulus terrestris]]'' in [[Hyderabad, India]]]]\n\n===Parasites===\nSimilar to other honeybees, ''Apis dorsata'' is regularly attacked by parasitic mites. The parasitic mite known to attack ''Apis dorsata'' is ''[[Tropilaelaps|Tropilaelaps clareae]]''. ''Tropilaelaps clareae'' needs brood in order to reproduce and are found in adult brood males of the colony. ''Apis dorsata'' is thought to be the original host of this parasite.<ref name=eleven>{{cite journal|last1=Buchler|first1=Ralph|title=Grooming Behaviour of Apis cerana, Apis mellifera and Apis dorsata and its effect on the parasitic mites Varroa jacobsoni and Tropilaelaps clareae|journal=Experimental and Applied Acarology|date=1992|volume=16|issue=4|pages=313\u2013319|doi=10.1007/bf01218573}}</ref> If ''Apis dorsata'' engages in brood-less migration, then the entire colony can reduce infestation by this parasitic mite.<ref name=three/> Although quite rare, some experimental evidence has shown that ''Apis dorsata'' exhibits a specialized grooming behavior as a defense mechanism to remove parasites.<ref name=\"eleven\"/> The grooming behavior involves intense shaking of the body and auto-grooming with the legs.<ref name=\"eleven\"/>\n\n===Defense against predators===\nSince the nests of ''Apis dorsata'' are fairly exposed and accessible to predators, these giant honeybees exhibit strong and aggressive defense strategies. Their predators include [[wasps]], [[hornets]], [[birds]], and human bee-hunters. Their defense strategies typically include physical contact, especially when they face attacks from wasps. These giant honeybees utilize a method called \u201cheat balling,\u201d in which they heat their thoraces to a temperature of 45 degrees Celsius (which is lethal to wasps.)<ref name=nih>{{cite journal|last1=Kastberger|first1=Gerald|title=Social Waves in Giant Honeybees Repel Hornets|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2008|volume=3|issue=9|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003141|pmid=18781205|pmc=2528003|pages=e3141|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.3141K}}</ref>\n\nAnother method that ''Apis dorsata'' utilizes against wasps is referred to as \u201cshimmering\u201d behavior or defense waving.<ref name=nih/> Bees in the outer layer thrust their abdomens 90\u00b0 in an upward direction and shake them in a synchronous way. This may be accompanied by stroking of the wings. The signal is transmitted to nearby workers that also adopt the posture, thus creating a visible \u2014 and audible \u2014 \"ripple\" effect across the face of the comb, in an almost identical manner to an [[Wave (audience)|audience wave]] at a crowded stadium. These wave-like patterns repel wasps that get too close to the nests of these bees and serve to confuse the wasp. In turn, the wasp cannot fixate on capturing one bee or getting food from the bees\u2019 nest, so the wasp will seek to find easier prey and leave this nest alone.<ref name=nih/> Shimmering appears to be an evolutionary successful behavior for group living amongst social bees.\n\nStudies have also provided evidence that these bee colonies aggregate in defense. If one part of the nest is directly threatened by a bird, a signal (still unknown as to how) gets relayed to the rest of the colony so that all of them help in the defense, even if they are not directly threatened.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=LK|title=The predator-prey interaction between blue-bearded bee eaters (Nyctornis athertoni Jardine and Selby 1830) and giant honeybees (Apis dorsata Fabricius 1798)|journal=Apidologie|date=2000|volume=31|issue=6|pages=727\u2013736|doi=10.1051/apido:2000157|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Human importance===\nThis [[genus]] has a long history with humankind. Cave paintings of these bees have been found in [[Valencia]], [[Spain]] that date back to the [[Paleolithic]] era (suspicious, as Valencia is well away from the Apis dorsata range; probably some other Apis species). In modern times, since large amounts of [[honey]] (up to 45 kilograms) can be stored in the nests of ''Apis dorsata'', many people frequently harvest their nests. Honey represents a livelihood for some of these people as it can provide them with an important source of income.<ref name=three/> However, [[deforestation]], [[urbanization]], [[pesticides]], and honey hunting have threatened local populations of bees and their honey. These bees are known to be aggressive, and they have the potential to viciously sting humans.<ref name=fifteen/> In fact, they are known as \u201cHejjenu\u201d in [[Karnataka]], [[India]] due to their aggressive behavior, large colonies, and painful stings.<ref name=fifteen/> At least one fatal defensive attack on a human has been reported.<ref>{{cite news |title=Death of man stung by bees ruled accidental|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/death-man-stung-bees-ruled-accidental-20140429 |work=[[The Straits Times]] |date=April 29, 2014 |accessdate=April 30, 2014 |first=Elena |last=Chong}}</ref>\n\n====Rafter beekeeping====\n[[File:Rafter beekeeping of Apis dorsata.jpg|thumb|left|Rafter beekeeping technique used with ''A. dorsata'']]\nIn some  ''[[Melaleuca]]'' forests of southern [[Vietnam]], people use a traditional method of collecting honey and wax from ''A. dorsata'' colonies.

At that time, people paid taxes to the government in exchange for living in the forest. Beeswax was used to pay the tax and for making candles, and was sold to visiting ships from Hainan, China.<ref>Dau, Nguyen Dinh.  1992.
