The battle resulted in the complete victory of the Imperial forces over their adversaries. The combat occurred near [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela in Navarre]], [[Spain]] during the [[Peninsular War]], part of a wider conflict known as the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nSpanish casualties were estimated to be about 4,000 dead and 3,000 prisoners out of a total force of 33,000. The French and Poles lost no more than 650 dead and wounded out of a total of 31,000. This is one of the battles whose name was engraved on the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in [[Paris]].<ref>[http://arcdetriomphe.info/battles/tudela/ Arc de Triomphe website]</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Dos de Mayo Uprising]] of 2 May 1808, followed by extensive uprisings throughout Spain, forced the French to pull back from their occupation of Spain to the [[Ebro]] River. There was an opportunity for the Spanish to finally expel the French altogether but this was missed due to their failure to appoint a Supreme Commander leaving the individual Spanish forces to operate independently.\n\nThese Spanish forces consisted of the army of General [[Joaqu\u00edn Blake]] on the North coast, the army of General [[Francisco Javier Casta\u00f1os, 1st Duke of Bail\u00e9n|Francisco Javier Casta\u00f1os]] around [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] and the army of General [[Jos\u00e9 Rebolledo de Palafox, 1st Duke of Saragossa|Jos\u00e9 Rebolledo de Palafox]] around [[Zaragoza]]. Blake was active in attacking the French but his offensive near [[Bilbao]] was defeated at [[Battle of Pancorbo (1808)|Pancorbo]] on 31 October 1808.\n\n[[Napoleon]]\u2019s strategy was to make a strong attack towards [[Burgos]] splitting off the army of Blake from the others and to outflank them by then swinging both north and south. It was in his interest that the Spanish maintain their exposed advanced positions. The French armies facing them were therefore ordered not to attack. So from October to 21 November 1808, Marshal [[Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey]]\u2019s [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]] remained static in front of Casta\u00f1os's army.\n\nThe Spanish armies were however in a constant state of movement to no effect. For much of the time Casta\u00f1os was ill leaving Palafox to direct operations. Palafox seems to have been indecisive on what course of action to take.<ref>This section is based on Rickard, J (28 February 2008), Battle of Tudela, 23 November 1808 [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_tudela.html ]</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nThe battlefield was the area between Tudela and the neighbouring hills on the left. The Spanish front was deployed on the hills of Santa Barbara, Tudela, Torre Monreal, Santa Quiteria the top of Cabezoe Maya (the hill where the retreat of San Juan de Calchetas was), and the villages of Urzante (now disappeared), [[Murchante]], and [[Cascante]]. Separating the Spanish and the French was the [[Queiles]] River, a tributary of the [[Ebro]].\n\nThe French advanced from the Cierzo hills that were in front of the Spanish lines towards the Spanish troops.\n\n==Preliminaries==\nOn 21 November 1808 Casta\u00f1os was around [[Calahorra]] on the Ebro between [[Logrono]] and Tudela. On this day the French III Corps crossed the Ebro at Logrono and headed east towards Calahorra while at the same time Marshal [[Michel Ney]] with the [[VI Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|VI Corps]] reached the Upper [[Douro]] Valley and headed towards Tudela.\n\n[[File:Esquema posiciones224.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|Diagram of Spanish positions: Santa Barbara - La Pe\u00f1a Division]]\n\nThese movements threatened Casta\u00f1os with entrapment between these two armies. To avoid this Casta\u00f1os withdrew to Tudela. He decided to defend a line {{convert|17|km|mi|0}} long stretching west from Tudela along the Ebro, then along the [[Queiles]] River to [[Cascante]] and finally to [[Tarazona]] at the foot of the [[Moncayo Massif]].\n\nCasta\u00f1os had insufficient men to hold a line of this length so he asked General [[Juan O'Neylle]], who had two divisions at [[Caparroso]] on the east bank of the Ebro, for help. As O\u2019Neylle was under the command of Palafox he refused to move without an order from Palafox. This did not arrive until noon on 22 November 1808. O\u2019Neylle moved promptly to the east bank of the Ebro opposite Tudela but decided not to cross the river until the next day.\n\nBy nightfall on 22 November 1808 Casta\u00f1os had almost 45,000 soldiers in the vicinity of Tudela but very few of them actually in position. Casta\u00f1os placed General [[Manuel la Pe\u00f1a]]\u2019s 4th Division of 8,000 men, mostly [[Andalusian people|Andalusians]] who had participated in the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]], at [[Cascante]] and General Grimarest at the head of three divisions totaling 13,000 to 14,000 soldiers at Tarazona. General Roca's division was on the east bank of the Ebro plus the two divisions from Aragon of O\u2019Neylle and [[Felipe Augusto de Saint-Marcq]].<ref>[http://www.aulamilitar.com/pagiht17.htm El regimiento de voluntarios de Segorbe (1808\u20131809) [[File:Flag of Spain (1785-1873 and 1875-1931).svg|20px]](Es)]</ref>\n\nMost of the fighting in the battle of Tudela would involve only the three divisions of Roca, O\u2019Neylle, and Saint-Marcq \u2013 totaling about 23,000 infantry.\n\nFor the French only the III Corps was involved in the Battle of Tudela. Prior to 22 November 1808 this force had been commanded by Marshal Moncey. However, Napoleon transferred command to Marshal [[Jean Lannes]] when the advance began. This corps was just under 34,000 men consisting of four infantry divisions and three cavalry regiments. To this was added [[General of Division]] [[Joseph Lagrange (soldier)|Joseph Lagrange]]\u2019s infantry division and [[General of Brigade]] [[Pierre David de Colbert-Chabanais]]\u2019s cavalry brigade from Ney's corps.\n\nOn the night of 22 November the French Army camped at [[Alfaro, La Rioja|Alfaro]] \u2013 17 kilometres up the Ebro from Tudela.<ref>This section is based on Rickard, J (28 February 2008), Battle of Tudela, 23 November 1808 [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_tudela.html ]</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Campo batalla224.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Progress Plan of the Battle]]\n\nOn the morning of 23 November 1808 Lagrange's infantry and two cavalry brigades were sent towards Cascante. The rest of the force was sent along the Ebro towards Tudela.\n\nAt this time O\u2019Neylle was trying to get his three divisions across the Ebro. Roca's was across first and reached its position on the right of the Spanish line just as the French attacked.\n\nSaint-Marcq's division was second across and also took up position before the attack.\n\n[[File:Batalla224.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Recreation of the battle on the hill of Santa Barbara with the tower of the cathedral in the background]]\n\nBy the time O\u2019Neylle's own division was crossing it had to fight French skirmishers who were at the top of the Cabezo Malla ridge.\n\nThe initial French attack was carried out in a piecemeal fashion by the vanguard when it was realised that the Spanish were not in position. Although this attack was repelled it showed the weakness of the Spanish positions, especially the {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} gap between Casta\u00f1os and La Pe\u00f1a's force at Cascante.\n\nThe battle would ultimately be decided by La Pe\u00f1a and Grimarest. By noon on 23 November 1808 they had received orders to move: La Pe\u00f1a to close the gap at Tudela and Grimarest to Cascante. Both men failed to carry out these orders other than La Pe\u00f1a moving two battalions and a detachment of provincial Grenadiers to Urzante. La Pe\u00f1a's lack of initiative allowed the two French cavalry brigades of Colbert and General of Brigade [[Alexandre, vicomte Digeon]] to pin him in place.\n \nThe second French attack was made with much greater force. On the French left General of Division [[Antoine Morlot]]\u2019s division attacked Roca's division on the heights above Tudela. On the French right General of Division [[Maurice Mathieu]]\u2019s division made a frontal assault on the smaller O\u2019Neylle division while also making outflanking moves. The attacks on both left and right were successful with both Spanish divisions being pushed off the ridges they occupied.\n\nThen the French cavalry under General of Division [[Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes]] charged the gap between Roca and Saint-Marcq causing the collapse of the Spanish right.\n\nLa Pe\u00f1a and Grimarest finally united at Cascante late in the day giving them a total of 21,000 men against Lagrange's division which was 6,000 strong plus Colbert and Digeon. After the defeat of the rest of the Spanish army however La Pe\u00f1a and Grimarest withdrew after dark. Their poor performance was also reflected in the casualties of only 200 on the Spanish left compared to 3,000 on the right plus 1,000 prisoners.<ref>This section based on Rickard, J (28 February 2008), Battle of Tudela, 23 November 1808 [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_tudela.html ]</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Spanish armies of the left and right escaped from Tudela in two directions. The Aragonese forces on the right made for Zaragoza where they would assist in the [[Second Siege of Zaragoza]] starting on 20 December 1808. The virtually intact Spanish left moved towards Madrid to defend that city.\n\nNapoleon however moved more quickly, and after defeating a small Spanish army at the [[Battle of Somosierra]] on 30 November 1808, arrived in Madrid on 1 December 1808.\n\nNapoleon's strategy ultimately ended in total success with Madrid in his hands. He was then able to prepare for the reconquest of Portugal.<ref>This section based on Rickard, J (28 February 2008), Battle of Tudela, 23 November 1808 [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_tudela.html ]</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|42|03|17.73|N|1|36|58.79|W|source:eswiki_region:ES_type:city|display=title}}\n\n==Other Reading==\n*''History of the Peninsular War vol.1: 1807-1809 - From the Treaty of Fontainebleau to the Battle of Corunna'', Sir Charles Oman, 704 pages, paperback, Greenhill Books, New Edition 2004, English, {{ISBN|978-1853675881}}\n\nThe first volume of Oman's classic seven volume history of the Peninsular War, this is one of the classic works of military history and provides an invaluable detailed narrative of the fighting in Spain and Portugal.

The battle resulted in the complete victory of the Imperial forces over their adversaries. The combat occurred near [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela in Navarre]], [[Spain]] during the [[Peninsular War]], part of a wider conflict known as the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nSpanish casualties were estimated to be about 4,000 dead and 3,000 prisoners out of a total force of 33,000. The French and Poles lost no more than 650 dead and wounded out of a total of 31,000. This is one of the battles whose name was engraved on the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in [[Paris]].<ref>[http://arcdetriomphe.info/battles/tudela/ Arc de Triomphe website]</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Dos de Mayo Uprising]] of 2 May 1808, followed by extensive uprisings throughout Spain, forced the French to pull back from their occupation of Spain to the [[Ebro]] River. There was an opportunity for the Spanish to finally expel the French altogether but this was missed due to their failure to appoint a Supreme Commander leaving the individual Spanish forces to operate independently.\n\nThese Spanish forces consisted of the army of General [[Joaqu\u00edn Blake]] on the North coast, the army of General [[Francisco Javier Casta\u00f1os, 1st Duke of Bail\u00e9n|Francisco Javier Casta\u00f1os]] around [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] and the army of General [[Jos\u00e9 Rebolledo de Palafox, 1st Duke of Saragossa|Jos\u00e9 Rebolledo de Palafox]] around [[Zaragoza]]. Blake was active in attacking the French but his offensive near [[Bilbao]] was defeated at [[Battle of Pancorbo (1808)|Pancorbo]] on 31 October 1808.\n\n[[Napoleon]]\u2019s strategy was to make a strong attack towards [[Burgos]] splitting off the army of Blake from the others and to outflank them by then swinging both north and south. It was in his interest that the Spanish maintain their exposed advanced positions. The French armies facing them were therefore ordered not to attack. So from October to 21 November 1808, Marshal [[Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey]]\u2019s [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]] remained static in front of Casta\u00f1os's army.\n\nThe Spanish armies were however in a constant state of movement to no effect. For much of the time Casta\u00f1os was ill leaving Palafox to direct operations. Palafox seems to have been indecisive on what course of action to take.<ref>This section is based on Rickard, J (28 February 2008), Battle of Tudela, 23 November 1808 [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_tudela.html ]</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nThe battlefield was the area between Tudela and the neighbouring hills on the left. The Spanish front was deployed on the hills of Santa Barbara, Tudela, Torre Monreal, Santa Quiteria the top of Cabezoe Maya (the hill where the retreat of San Juan de Calchetas was), and the villages of Urzante (now disappeared), [[Murchante]], and [[Cascante]]. Separating the Spanish and the French was the [[Queiles]] River, a tributary of the [[Ebro]].\n\nThe French advanced from the Cierzo hills that were in front of the Spanish lines towards the Spanish troops.\n\n==Preliminaries==\nOn 21 November 1808 Casta\u00f1os was around [[Calahorra]] on the Ebro between [[Logrono]] and Tudela. On this day the French III Corps crossed the Ebro at Logrono and headed east towards Calahorra while at the same time Marshal [[Michel Ney]] with the [[VI Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|VI Corps]] reached the Upper [[Douro]] Valley and headed towards Tudela.\n\n[[File:Esquema posiciones224.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|Diagram of Spanish positions: Santa Barbara - La Pe\u00f1a Division]]\n\nThese movements threatened Casta\u00f1os with entrapment between these two armies. To avoid this Casta\u00f1os withdrew to Tudela. He decided to defend a line {{convert|17|km|mi|0}} long stretching west from Tudela along the Ebro, then along the [[Queiles]] River to [[Cascante]] and finally to [[Tarazona]] at the foot of the [[Moncayo Massif]].\n\nCasta\u00f1os had insufficient men to hold a line of this length so he asked General [[Juan O'Neylle]], who had two divisions at [[Caparroso]] on the east bank of the Ebro, for help. As O\u2019Neylle was under the command of Palafox he refused to move without an order from Palafox. This did not arrive until noon on 22 November 1808. O\u2019Neylle moved promptly to the east bank of the Ebro opposite Tudela but decided not to cross the river until the next day.\n\nBy nightfall on 22 November 1808 Casta\u00f1os had almost 45,000 soldiers in the vicinity of Tudela but very few of them actually in position.

General Roca's division was on the east bank of the Ebro plus the two divisions from Aragon of O\u2019Neylle and [[Felipe Augusto de Saint-Marcq]].<ref>[http://www.aulamilitar.com/pagiht17.htm El regimiento de voluntarios de Segorbe (1808\u20131809) [[File:Flag of Spain (1785-1873 and 1875-1931).svg|20px]](Es)]</ref>\n\nMost of the fighting in the battle of Tudela would involve only the three divisions of Roca, O\u2019Neylle, and Saint-Marcq \u2013 totaling about 23,000 infantry.\n\nFor the French only the III Corps was involved in the Battle of Tudela.

Organizations may use telecommuting to reduce costs (telecommuting employees do not require an office or [[cubicle]], a space which needs to be rented or purchased, and incurs additional costs such as lighting, climate control, etc.). Some organizations adopt telecommuting to improve workers' quality of life, as teleworking typically reduces commuting time and time stuck in [[traffic jam]]s. Along with this, teleworking may make it easier for workers to balance their work responsibilities with their personal life and family roles (e.g., caring for children or elderly parents). Some organizations adopt teleworking for environmental reasons, as telework can reduce [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] and [[air pollution]], with less cars on the roads.\n\n==Terminology==\nAlthough the concepts of \"telecommuting\" and \"telework\" are closely related, there is a difference between the two. All types of technology-assisted work conducted outside a centrally located work space (including work undertaken in the home, outside calls, etc.) are regarded as telework. Telecommuters often maintain a traditional office and usually work from an alternative work site from 1 to 3 days a week.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hill | first1 = J.

The ongoing and exponential decreases in cost along with the increases in performance and usability of personal computers, forged the way for moving the office to the home. By the early 1980s, branch offices and home workers were able to connect to organizational mainframes using personal computers and terminal emulation. Telework is facilitated by tools such as groupware, virtual private networks, conference calling, [[videotelephony|videoconferencing]], virtual call centre, Voice over IP (VOIP), and by the decreasing cost of good quality laptop computers. It can be efficient and useful for companies since it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As broadband Internet connections become more commonplace, more and more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal phone networks.\n\nThe adoption of local area networks promoted the sharing of resources, and client\u2013server model client\u2013server computing allowed for even greater decentralization. Today, telecommuters can carry laptops which they can use both at the office, at home, and nearly anywhere else.

An increase in skill variety is thought to increase the challenge of the job. Increasing the challenge of the job increases the individual's experienced meaningfulness, how much the individual cares about work, and finds it worthwhile.<ref name =\"Oldham 2005\"/><ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/> Telework may not directly affect skill variety and task meaningfulness for the individual compared to when he or she worked in an office; however, skill variety and meaningfulness of individual tasks can increase when working in a group.

Task significance is the degree that the individual feels his or her work has a substantial impact on the lives or work of other people within the organization or outside the organization.<ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/><ref name=\"Shamir\"/> Telework may not change the job characteristics of skill variety, task identity, and task significance compared to working in an office; however, the presence of these characteristics will influence teleworkers\u2019 work outcomes and attitudes.\n\n===Individual difference===\nIndividuals may differ in their reactions to the job characteristics in telecommuting. According to job characteristics theory, the personal need for accomplishment and development (growth need strength)<ref name=\"Hackman1971\"/> influences how much an individual will react to the job dimensions of telecommuting. For instance, those individuals high in growth need strength will have a more positive reaction to increased autonomy and a more negative reaction to decreased feedback in telecommuting than those individuals low in growth need strength.\n\n==Other theories==\nTelecommuting is a new work situation with a flexible structure that makes it different from traditional work environments.<ref name=\"Torraco\" >{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/hrdq.1125|title=Work design theory: A review and critique with implications for human resource development|year=2005|last1=Torraco|first1=Richard J.|journal=Human Resource Development Quarterly|volume=16|pages=85\u2013109}}</ref> Various job design theories, in addition to job characteristics theory, can help explain the differences between telecommuting and traditional job settings.\n\n===Motivator-hygiene theory===\n[[Motivator-hygiene theory]]<ref name=\"Herzberg\">Herzberg, F., Mausner, B., & Snyderman, B.B., (1959).

A working-from-home-related experiment conducted using 242 employees of a large Chinese [[travel agency]] by professors at [[Stanford]] and [[Beijing University]] found that employees randomly assigned to work at home for 9 months increased their output by 13.5% versus the office-based control group. This improvement in output arose from working 9% more hours from saved commuting time and from 3.5% improved efficiency from quieter working conditions. The study also found that home-workers reported significantly higher job-satisfaction scores and their quit rates fell by almost 50%. However, home workers' promotion rates dropped by half due to apparent performance declines, indicating a potential career cost of home-working.<ref>Bloom, Nicholas, Liang, James, Roberts, John and Ying, Jenny [http://www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/WFH.pdf \"Does working from home work?

Fewer, if any, traces of non-productive work activities (research, self-training, dealing with technical problems or equipment failures) and time lost on unsuccessful attempts (early drafts, fruitless endeavors, abortive innovations) are visible to employers. Piece rate, commissions, or other performance-based compensation also become more likely for telecommuters. Furthermore, major chunks of per-employee expenses are absorbed by the telecommuter himself - from simple coffee, water, electricity, and telecommunications services, to huge capital expenses like office equipment or software licenses. Thus, hours spent on the job tend to be underestimated and expenses under-reported, creating overly optimistic figures of productivity gains and savings, some or all of those in fact coming out of the telecommuter's time and pocket.<ref>{{cite web\n   |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20141210926\n   |title=Richie v.

Telework is a shift in the way business is accomplished which can make a difference overtime. As an example, a recent Australian study revealed that telework enabled by the National Broadband Network is expected to add $8.3 billion to Gross Domestic Product by 2020, creating the equivalent of an additional 25,000 full-time jobs. Around 10,000 of these jobs will be in regional Australia. When it comes to environment, it has been estimated that if 10 per cent of Australian employees were to telework 50 percent of the time, it would save 120 million litres of fuel and 320,000 tonnes of carbon emissions. That rate of telework would also deliver a productivity benefit of between $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbn.gov.au/nbn-benefits/digital-economy-goals/telework/ |title=NBN - Telework (defunct) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309010053/http://www.nbn.gov.au/nbn-benefits/digital-economy-goals/telework/ |archivedate=2013-03-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Turnover intention===\n[[Turnover intention]], or the desire to leave the organization, is lower for teleworkers.<ref name=\"Gaj\"/> Those teleworkers who experienced greater professional isolation actually had lower turnover intent.<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> One study found that by increasing feedback and task identity through clear communication of goals, objectives, and expectations, turnover intent decreased in teleworkers and quality of work output increased.<ref name=\"Ilozor\"/>\n\n===Advantages and disadvantages meta-analysis===\nA meta-analysis of 46 studies of telecommuting involving 12,833 employees conducted by Ravi Gajendran and David A. Harrison in the ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', published by the American Psychological Association (APA), found that telecommuting has largely positive consequences for employees and employers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2007/11/telecommuting.aspx|title=APA Press Release \"Telecommuting has Mostly Positive Consequences for Employees and Employers, Say Researchers\"\n|author=APA  |publisher=American Psychological Association  |date=November 19, 2007 |accessdate=November 6, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Gaj\" /> In their meta-analytic study, Gajendran and Harrison found that telecommuting had modest but beneficial effects on employees' job satisfaction, perceived autonomy, stress levels, manager-rated job performance, and (lower) work-family conflict. Telecommuting also reduces turnover intent, or the intention to quit one's job. Increased job satisfaction, decreased turnover intent and role stress related to telecommuting partly because of a decrease in work-family conflict. Additionally, the increase in autonomy from teleworking in turn increases job satisfaction.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAlthough a number of scholars and managers had previously expressed fears that employee careers might suffer and workplace relationships might be damaged because of telecommuting, the meta-analysis found that there are no generally detrimental effects on the quality of workplace relationships and career outcomes.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Telecommuting actually was found to positively affect employee-supervisor relations and the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intent was in part due to supervisor relationship quality.  Only high-intensity telecommuting (where employees work from home for more than 2.5 days a week) harmed employee relationships with co-workers, even though it did reduce work-family conflict.\n\n==Potential drawbacks and concerns==\nSkill variety has the strongest relationship with internal [[work motivation]].<ref name=\"Fried\"/> Jobs that allow workers to use a variety of skills increase workers\u2019 internal work motivation. If teleworkers are limited in teamwork opportunities and have fewer opportunities to use a variety of skills,<ref name=\"Shamir\"/> they may have lower internal motivation towards their work. Also, perceived social isolation can lead to less motivation.<ref name=\"Maruy\" /> It can be argued that without a work climate or manager nearby, the ability to motivate oneself is even more important when telecommuting than when working in an office. Though working in an office has its distractions, it is often argued that telecommuting involves even greater distractions. According to one study, children are ranked as the number one distractions, followed by spouses, pets, neighbors, and solicitors. The lack of proper tools and facilities also serves as a major distraction,<ref>{{cite web|title=3 Reasons Why Working From Home Can be Unproductive|url=http://www.corporatesuites.com/3-reasons-working-home-can-unproductive/|publisher=Corporate Suites|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref> though this can be mitigated by using short-term [[coworking]] rental facilities.\n\nFace-to-face interactions increase interpersonal contact, connectedness, and trust<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> Therefore, 54% of teleworkers thought they lost out on social interaction and 52.5% felt they lost out on professional interaction in a 2012 study.<ref name=\"Maruy\"/> Teleworking can hurt working relationships between the teleworker and their coworkers, especially if their coworkers do not telework. Coworkers who do not telework can feel resentful and jealous because they may consider it unfair if they are not allowed to telework as well.<ref name=\"Gaj\"/><ref name=\"Morganson, V. J. 2010\"/> However, despite fewer interpersonal actions and professional isolation,<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> a meta-analysis of telecommuting did not find support for negative telecommuter-coworker relationships or telecommuter-supervisor relationships.<ref name=\"Gaj\"/> Employers' largest concerns about telecommuting are fear of loss of control; 75% of managers say they trust their employees, but a third say they would like to be able to see them, \"just to be sure\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://undress4success.com/research/pros-cons/|title=Lister, Kate, Undress For Success--The Naked Truth About Making Money at Home, (John Wiley & Sons 2009, {{Text|ISBN}} 978-0-470-38332-2) quoting Management-Issues.com (July 30, 2007) survey|accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref>\n\nEmployees who telework may feel pressure to produce more output in order to be seen as valuable, and reduce the idea that they are doing less work than others. This pressure to produce output, as well as a lack of social support from limited coworker relationships and feelings of isolation, leads to lower job engagement in teleworkers.<ref name=\"Sardes\"/> Additionally, higher-quality relationships with teammates decreased job satisfaction of teleworkers, potentially because of frustrations with exchanging interactions via technology.<ref name=\"golden006\">{{cite journal | last1 = Golden | first1 = T.

Reports finding that all 87 agencies participating in the Data Cell had established telework policies and 73 percent of the policies met the Telework Act Requirements. More than 684,000 federal employees were deemed eligible to telework, this represents approximately 32 percent of all federal employees. More than 144,000 federal employees had written teleworking agreements with their agencies. 27 percent of teleworkers worked remotely three or more days per week.<ref name=\"mnn.com\">{{cite web |title=Federal Teleworking Report Released |url=http://www.mnn.com/money/green-workplace/blogs/federal-teleworking-report-released}}</ref> In addition to the findings, the reports examine teleworking at the Department of Defense. According to the report, there are more than 793,000 employees in the DoD and of those employees, 134,477 were deemed eligible for teleworking. Overall, the federal government seems to have embraced teleworking and is attempting to create more remote working opportunities for employees. In closing, the report listed several ways that the government could make more jobs available through telework. Suggestions include using telework as a tool to retain employees at or near retirement age and using telework to expand hiring of highly trained disabled veterans.<ref name=\"mnn.com\"/>\n\n===Centers===\nTelework centers are offices that are generally set up close to a majority of people who might otherwise drive or take [[public transit]]. They usually feature the full complement of office equipment and a high-speed Internet connection for maximum [[productivity]]. Some feature support staff, including receptionists or administrators. For example, a number of telework centers have been set up around the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]]: 7 in Maryland, 8 in Virginia, 3 in Washington, D.C. and 1 in West Virginia. Telework centers allow people to reduce their commute yet still work in a traditional office setting. Some telework centers are set up by individual companies while others are established by independent organizations for use by many organizations. Telework centers are attractive to people who do not have the space or inclination to work from home. They offer employers the ability to maintain a more formal structure for their workforce.\n\nThese work arrangements are more likely to become more popular with current trends towards greater customization of services and virtual organizing. Distributed work offers great potential for firms to reduce costs, enhance competitive advantage and agility, access a greater variety of scarce talents, and improve employee flexibility, effectiveness and productivity.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1287/mnsc.38.12.1687|title=An Emerging Distributed Work Arrangement: An Investigation of Computer-Based Supplemental Work at Home|year=1992|last1=Venkatesh|first1=Alladi|last2=Vitalari|first2=Nicholas P.|journal=Management Science|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1687\u20131706}}</ref><ref>Korte, W.

A remote office center provides professional grade network access, phone system, security system, mail stop and optional services for additional costs.  ROCs are generally located in areas near to where people live throughout population centers, so that workers do not have to commute more than a couple of miles.  The telecommuter works in a real office but accesses the company network across the internet using a VPN just as in traditional telecommuting.\n\nThis type of arrangement does not share fully in the benefits of home-based telecommuting, but can address the needs of employees who are unable or unwilling to work from home.\n\n===Information Security for Teleworkers===\n\"To hackers who make a living stealing information from unsecured computers and network connections, the teleworker could be an open the door to the organization\u2019s most sensitive data. Security and privacy have become increasingly rare commodities these days thanks to the ability of hackers to stay one step ahead of just about every security measure that technicians can create.  Security breaches are a significant enough threat in a standard office environment; however, when an organization has employees working from home or on the go, these risks become even greater.\n\nIt is vital for organizations to convey to teleworkers that data protection and information security are important to an organization, and employees\u2019 actions make a difference in achieving the overall goal of protection of sensitive data. Despite increased awareness and training on security issues, many employees do not take the necessary precautions for deterring security risks.\n\nReal security begins with security policy. The Information Security professional must ensure that the security policy covers telecommuting/teleworking and who may telework, services available to teleworkers, information restrictions, identification/authentication/authorization, equipment and software specifications, integrity and confidentiality, maintenance guidelines, and robust user education.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Improving Information Security for Teleworkers |first=Tim |last=Godlove |url=https://www.ufairfax.edu/news/Improving-Information-Security-for-Teleworkers-20170113-0022 |publisher=University of Fairfax }}</ref>\n\n===Other countries===\nAccording to an article from the ''New York Times'', telecommuting now takes about 2.6 percent of the American workforce not including remote works like drivers. The article also mentions an experiment done by Nicholas Bloom. Nicholas Bloom is an economics professor from Stanford University. During this experiment, 250 workers were picked randomly from Ctrip to work either at home or at an office. Ctrip is a large China travel agency.  The result showed that those who telecommuted worked longer hours than those who worked at an office. The telecommuters were also more productive and happier. Ctrip saved around 2K from telecommuting. Although the quitting rate decreased for telecommuters, the promotion rate also decreased. Many telecommuters asked to be back in the office at the end with reasoning like loneliness and desire for promotion. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, came to the conclusion that most workers prefer telecommuting and office work combined. Telecommuting increases efficiency and workers\u2019 flexibility.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yee|first1=Marilynn K.|title=It's Unclearly Defined, but Telecommuting Is Fast on the Rise|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/your-money/when-working-in-your-pajamas-is-more-productive.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nAmerica has an increasing trend of using teleworking  due to its strong economics and multimedia services.

One of the ethical issues behind telecommuting is who should have the chance to telecommute? One may have more chance to work at home because he/she has young children. The other one may argue he/she also has personal problems. It is favored by most workers to combine telecommuting and office work. Many think that telecommuting once or twice a week is a reasonable schedule. Businesses also favor this suggestion because workers are more satisfied and companies save money from it.\n\n===Effects of 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic===\nAnalysts have suggested that the ongoing [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]] could be a \"tipping point\" for telecommuting.<ref>https://www.geekwire.com/2020/coronavirus-tipping-point-finally-telecommuting/</ref> In [[Seattle]], [[Microsoft]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Facebook]], and [[Google]] have mandated employees work from home.<ref>https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166686/coronavirus-amazon-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter-seattle-staff-remote-work</ref><ref>https://www.geekwire.com/2020/seattle-morning-traffic-disappears-amazon-microsoft-others-enforce-remote-work-policies/</ref> Others have suggested that an increase in telecommuting as a result of the outbreak could result in an expanded [[right to Internet access]] in the United States.<ref>https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-03-06/coronavirus-telecommute-work-from-home</ref><br>\nEuropean countries are taking active measures to transfer employees to remote work and receive support from the government in this direction.\nThe pandemic triggered by COVID-19 affected the whole world and has not spared Belarus. One of the key recommendations from WHO is to observe personal hygiene measures and physical distancing. Because of that, many social events and the face-to-face business moved online, and their employees are working from home.<ref>https://amasty.com/blog/remote-work-in-belarus-during-the-pandemic-2020/</ref>\n\n==Related terms and concepts==\n\n===Coworking===\n{{main|Coworking}}\nCoworking is a social gathering of a group of people who are still working independently, but who share a common working area as well as the synergy that can happen from working with people in the same space. Coworking facilities can range from shared space in formal offices to social areas such as a coffee shop. Entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs often cowork in shared office and workshop facilities provided by [[business incubator]]s and [[business accelerator]] organizations. In entrepreneurship, coworking allows creative start-up founders, researchers and knowledge workers to [[business network|meet and share ideas]], collaborate, share new research, and find potential partners.\n\n===Distributed work===\nDistributed work entails the conduct of organizational tasks in places that extend beyond the confines of traditional [[office]]s or workspaces. It can refer to organizational arrangements that permit or require workers to perform work more effectively at any appropriate location&mdash;such as their homes or [[customer|customers']] sites&mdash;through the application of information and communication technology. An example is [[financial planner]]s who meet clients during the client's lunchtime at the client's workplace; even though this is an out-of-the-office, meeting, the [[Internet]] enables the planner to present financial planning tools and presentations on their mobile computers.

There are an estimated 300 million homeworkers in the world,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} though because these workers generally function in the [[informal economy]], and are seldom registered and often not contracted, exact numbers are difficult to come by.  Recently, the phenomenon of homework has grown with increased [[communication technology]], as well as changes in supply chains, particularly the development of [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] inventory systems. Homeworkers are often employed in [[piece work]].\n\nHomeworkers differ from [[entrepreneur]]s, or [[self-employed]], or [[family business]], in that they are hired by companies for specific activities or services to be done from their homes. Homeworkers do not own or operate the business they work for. Though there is a significant body of highly skilled homeworkers, particularly in [[information technology]], most homeworkers are considered low skilled labour.  Recently, working conditions have worsened for homeworkers,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} and they are becoming a point of concern for [[international development]] organizations and [[non-governmental organization]]s. {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Media richness theory]]\n* [[Work\u2013family conflict]]\n* [[Canadian Telework Association]] (CTA)\n* [[Comparison of office suites]]: the online versions of office suites mentioned there are useful for telecommuters)\n* [[Comparison of FTP client software]]: for file upload to a server\n* [[Comparison of file hosting services]]: for file upload to a server and sharing\n* [[Comparison of cross-platform instant messaging clients]]: for communication and p2p file sharing\n* [[Comparison of web conferencing software]]: for communication with groups\n* [[Corporate wiki]]\n* [[Coworking]]\n* [[Distance learning]]\n* [[Flextime]]\n* [[Home Work Convention, 1996]]\n* [[Hot desking]]\n* [[Hoteling]]\n* [[Job characteristic theory]]\n* [[Labour market flexibility]]\n* [[Outsourcing]]\n* [[Putting-out system]]\n* [[Small office/home office]]\n* [[Study (room)]]\n* [[Telecentre]]\n* [[Telecommunication]]\n* [[Virtual assistant (occupation)|Virtual assistant]]\n* [[Virtual team]]\n* [[Virtual volunteering]]\n* [[Work at home scheme]]\n* [[Work-life balance]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[John O'Duinn|O'Duinn, J.]], (2018) Distributed Teams: The Art and Practice of Working Together While Physically Apart, {{ISBN|978-1732254909}}\n* Thomas L.

Organizations may use telecommuting to reduce costs (telecommuting employees do not require an office or [[cubicle]], a space which needs to be rented or purchased, and incurs additional costs such as lighting, climate control, etc.). Some organizations adopt telecommuting to improve workers' quality of life, as teleworking typically reduces commuting time and time stuck in [[traffic jam]]s. Along with this, teleworking may make it easier for workers to balance their work responsibilities with their personal life and family roles (e.g., caring for children or elderly parents). Some organizations adopt teleworking for environmental reasons, as telework can reduce [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] and [[air pollution]], with less cars on the roads.\n\n==Terminology==\nAlthough the concepts of \"telecommuting\" and \"telework\" are closely related, there is a difference between the two. All types of technology-assisted work conducted outside a centrally located work space (including work undertaken in the home, outside calls, etc.) are regarded as telework.

The ongoing and exponential decreases in cost along with the increases in performance and usability of personal computers, forged the way for moving the office to the home. By the early 1980s, branch offices and home workers were able to connect to organizational mainframes using personal computers and terminal emulation. Telework is facilitated by tools such as groupware, virtual private networks, conference calling, [[videotelephony|videoconferencing]], virtual call centre, Voice over IP (VOIP), and by the decreasing cost of good quality laptop computers. It can be efficient and useful for companies since it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As broadband Internet connections become more commonplace, more and more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal phone networks.\n\nThe adoption of local area networks promoted the sharing of resources, and client\u2013server model client\u2013server computing allowed for even greater decentralization. Today, telecommuters can carry laptops which they can use both at the office, at home, and nearly anywhere else.

Telework provides flexibility in scheduling and freedom because being outside the office gives the worker more choices.

Feedback refers to the degree that an individual receives direct and clear information about his or her performance related to work activities.<ref name=\"Hackman1971\"/> Feedback is particularly important so that the employees continuously learn about how they are performing.<ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/> Electronic communication provides fewer cues for teleworkers and thus, they may have more difficulties interpreting and gaining information, and subsequently, receiving feedback.<ref name=\"Sardes\"/> When a worker is not in the office, there is limited information and greater ambiguity, such as in assignments and expectations.<ref name=\"Golden11\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0018726711418387|title=Does it matter where your manager works?

The clarity, speed of response, richness of the communication, frequency, and quality of the feedback are often reduced when managers telework.<ref name=\"Golden11\"/>\n\n===Skill variety, task identity, and task significance===\nThree of the five job attributes: skill variety, task identity, and task significance, influence how much employees think their jobs are meaningful.<ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/> Skill variety is the degree that a job requires a variety of activities and skills to complete the task. An increase in skill variety is thought to increase the challenge of the job. Increasing the challenge of the job increases the individual's experienced meaningfulness, how much the individual cares about work, and finds it worthwhile.<ref name =\"Oldham 2005\"/><ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/> Telework may not directly affect skill variety and task meaningfulness for the individual compared to when he or she worked in an office; however, skill variety and meaningfulness of individual tasks can increase when working in a group. If the work done at home is focused on the individual rather than the team, there may be fewer opportunities to use a variety of skills.<ref name=\"Shamir\">{{cite journal|doi=10.5465/amr.1985.4278957|title=Work-At-Home and the Quality of Working Life|year=1985|last1=Shamir|first1=Boas|last2=Salomon|first2=Ilan|journal=Academy of Management Review|volume=10|issue=3|pages=455\u2013464}}</ref>\n\nTask identity is the degree that the individual sees work from beginning to end or completes an identifiable or whole piece of work rather than only a small piece. Task significance is the degree that the individual feels his or her work has a substantial impact on the lives or work of other people within the organization or outside the organization.<ref name=\"Hackman1976\"/><ref name=\"Shamir\"/> Telework may not change the job characteristics of skill variety, task identity, and task significance compared to working in an office; however, the presence of these characteristics will influence teleworkers\u2019 work outcomes and attitudes.\n\n===Individual difference===\nIndividuals may differ in their reactions to the job characteristics in telecommuting. According to job characteristics theory, the personal need for accomplishment and development (growth need strength)<ref name=\"Hackman1971\"/> influences how much an individual will react to the job dimensions of telecommuting. For instance, those individuals high in growth need strength will have a more positive reaction to increased autonomy and a more negative reaction to decreased feedback in telecommuting than those individuals low in growth need strength.\n\n==Other theories==\nTelecommuting is a new work situation with a flexible structure that makes it different from traditional work environments.<ref name=\"Torraco\" >{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/hrdq.1125|title=Work design theory: A review and critique with implications for human resource development|year=2005|last1=Torraco|first1=Richard J.|journal=Human Resource Development Quarterly|volume=16|pages=85\u2013109}}</ref> Various job design theories, in addition to job characteristics theory, can help explain the differences between telecommuting and traditional job settings.\n\n===Motivator-hygiene theory===\n[[Motivator-hygiene theory]]<ref name=\"Herzberg\">Herzberg, F., Mausner, B., & Snyderman, B.B., (1959).

A 2008 Robert Half International Financial Hiring Index, a survey of 1,400 [[CFO]]s by recruitment firm Robert Half International, indicated that 13% consider telework the best recruiting incentive today for accounting professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roberthalffinance.com/portal/site/rhf-us/template.PAGE/menuitem.b55c61eb41144dbf9a64e9c302f3dfa0/?javax.portlet.tpst=7658df44c982f2e6fa64e9c302f3dfa0&javax.portlet.prp_7658df44c982f2e6fa64e9c302f3dfa0_releaseId=2108&javax.portlet.prp_7658df44c982f2e6fa64e9c302f3dfa0_request_type=RenderPressRelease&javax.portlet.begCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken&javax.portlet.endCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken|title=Survey Finds Salary Is Top Draw for Job Candidates but Benefits Nearly As Popular\n|author=Robert Half International  |date=2008-02-06}}</ref> In earlier surveys, 33% considered telework the best recruiting incentive, and half considered it second best.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/Group-touts-telecommuting-s-green-benefits-3286958.php\n|title=SF Chronicle \"Group touts telecommuting's green benefits\"\n|author=Tom Abate  |publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc.  |date=April 22, 2008  |accessdate=November 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSince work hours are less regulated in telework, employee effort and dedication are far more likely to be measured purely in terms of output or results. Fewer, if any, traces of non-productive work activities (research, self-training, dealing with technical problems or equipment failures) and time lost on unsuccessful attempts (early drafts, fruitless endeavors, abortive innovations) are visible to employers. Piece rate, commissions, or other performance-based compensation also become more likely for telecommuters. Furthermore, major chunks of per-employee expenses are absorbed by the telecommuter himself - from simple coffee, water, electricity, and telecommunications services, to huge capital expenses like office equipment or software licenses. Thus, hours spent on the job tend to be underestimated and expenses under-reported, creating overly optimistic figures of productivity gains and savings, some or all of those in fact coming out of the telecommuter's time and pocket.<ref>{{cite web\n   |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20141210926\n   |title=Richie v.

Telework is a shift in the way business is accomplished which can make a difference overtime. As an example, a recent Australian study revealed that telework enabled by the National Broadband Network is expected to add $8.3 billion to Gross Domestic Product by 2020, creating the equivalent of an additional 25,000 full-time jobs. Around 10,000 of these jobs will be in regional Australia. When it comes to environment, it has been estimated that if 10 per cent of Australian employees were to telework 50 percent of the time, it would save 120 million litres of fuel and 320,000 tonnes of carbon emissions. That rate of telework would also deliver a productivity benefit of between $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbn.gov.au/nbn-benefits/digital-economy-goals/telework/ |title=NBN - Telework (defunct) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309010053/http://www.nbn.gov.au/nbn-benefits/digital-economy-goals/telework/ |archivedate=2013-03-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Turnover intention===\n[[Turnover intention]], or the desire to leave the organization, is lower for teleworkers.<ref name=\"Gaj\"/> Those teleworkers who experienced greater professional isolation actually had lower turnover intent.<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> One study found that by increasing feedback and task identity through clear communication of goals, objectives, and expectations, turnover intent decreased in teleworkers and quality of work output increased.<ref name=\"Ilozor\"/>\n\n===Advantages and disadvantages meta-analysis===\nA meta-analysis of 46 studies of telecommuting involving 12,833 employees conducted by Ravi Gajendran and David A. Harrison in the ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', published by the American Psychological Association (APA), found that telecommuting has largely positive consequences for employees and employers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2007/11/telecommuting.aspx|title=APA Press Release \"Telecommuting has Mostly Positive Consequences for Employees and Employers, Say Researchers\"\n|author=APA  |publisher=American Psychological Association  |date=November 19, 2007 |accessdate=November 6, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Gaj\" /> In their meta-analytic study, Gajendran and Harrison found that telecommuting had modest but beneficial effects on employees' job satisfaction, perceived autonomy, stress levels, manager-rated job performance, and (lower) work-family conflict. Telecommuting also reduces turnover intent, or the intention to quit one's job. Increased job satisfaction, decreased turnover intent and role stress related to telecommuting partly because of a decrease in work-family conflict. Additionally, the increase in autonomy from teleworking in turn increases job satisfaction.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAlthough a number of scholars and managers had previously expressed fears that employee careers might suffer and workplace relationships might be damaged because of telecommuting, the meta-analysis found that there are no generally detrimental effects on the quality of workplace relationships and career outcomes.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Telecommuting actually was found to positively affect employee-supervisor relations and the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intent was in part due to supervisor relationship quality.  Only high-intensity telecommuting (where employees work from home for more than 2.5 days a week) harmed employee relationships with co-workers, even though it did reduce work-family conflict.\n\n==Potential drawbacks and concerns==\nSkill variety has the strongest relationship with internal [[work motivation]].<ref name=\"Fried\"/> Jobs that allow workers to use a variety of skills increase workers\u2019 internal work motivation. If teleworkers are limited in teamwork opportunities and have fewer opportunities to use a variety of skills,<ref name=\"Shamir\"/> they may have lower internal motivation towards their work. Also, perceived social isolation can lead to less motivation.<ref name=\"Maruy\" /> It can be argued that without a work climate or manager nearby, the ability to motivate oneself is even more important when telecommuting than when working in an office. Though working in an office has its distractions, it is often argued that telecommuting involves even greater distractions. According to one study, children are ranked as the number one distractions, followed by spouses, pets, neighbors, and solicitors. The lack of proper tools and facilities also serves as a major distraction,<ref>{{cite web|title=3 Reasons Why Working From Home Can be Unproductive|url=http://www.corporatesuites.com/3-reasons-working-home-can-unproductive/|publisher=Corporate Suites|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref> though this can be mitigated by using short-term [[coworking]] rental facilities.\n\nFace-to-face interactions increase interpersonal contact, connectedness, and trust<ref name=\"Golden 2008\"/> Therefore, 54% of teleworkers thought they lost out on social interaction and 52.5% felt they lost out on professional interaction in a 2012 study.<ref name=\"Maruy\"/> Teleworking can hurt working relationships between the teleworker and their coworkers, especially if their coworkers do not telework.

This pressure to produce output, as well as a lack of social support from limited coworker relationships and feelings of isolation, leads to lower job engagement in teleworkers.<ref name=\"Sardes\"/> Additionally, higher-quality relationships with teammates decreased job satisfaction of teleworkers, potentially because of frustrations with exchanging interactions via technology.<ref name=\"golden006\">{{cite journal | last1 = Golden | first1 = T.

(1) Improve continuity of operations, (2) Promote management Effectiveness and (3) Enhance work-life balance.<ref>{{cite web |title=U.S. Government Agencies Lead in Telework |url=http://www.mobileworkexchange.com/uploads/1000/810-US_Government_Agencies_Lead_in_Telework.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514140436/http://www.mobileworkexchange.com/uploads/1000/810-US_Government_Agencies_Lead_in_Telework.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-05-14 }}</ref>\n\nThe 2012 Status Telework in the Federal Government features teleworking highlights from the past 18 months as well as goals for improving teleworking in the future. Reports finding that all 87 agencies participating in the Data Cell had established telework policies and 73 percent of the policies met the Telework Act Requirements. More than 684,000 federal employees were deemed eligible to telework, this represents approximately 32 percent of all federal employees. More than 144,000 federal employees had written teleworking agreements with their agencies. 27 percent of teleworkers worked remotely three or more days per week.<ref name=\"mnn.com\">{{cite web |title=Federal Teleworking Report Released |url=http://www.mnn.com/money/green-workplace/blogs/federal-teleworking-report-released}}</ref> In addition to the findings, the reports examine teleworking at the Department of Defense. According to the report, there are more than 793,000 employees in the DoD and of those employees, 134,477 were deemed eligible for teleworking. Overall, the federal government seems to have embraced teleworking and is attempting to create more remote working opportunities for employees. In closing, the report listed several ways that the government could make more jobs available through telework. Suggestions include using telework as a tool to retain employees at or near retirement age and using telework to expand hiring of highly trained disabled veterans.<ref name=\"mnn.com\"/>\n\n===Centers===\nTelework centers are offices that are generally set up close to a majority of people who might otherwise drive or take [[public transit]]. They usually feature the full complement of office equipment and a high-speed Internet connection for maximum [[productivity]]. Some feature support staff, including receptionists or administrators. For example, a number of telework centers have been set up around the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]]: 7 in Maryland, 8 in Virginia, 3 in Washington, D.C. and 1 in West Virginia. Telework centers allow people to reduce their commute yet still work in a traditional office setting. Some telework centers are set up by individual companies while others are established by independent organizations for use by many organizations. Telework centers are attractive to people who do not have the space or inclination to work from home. They offer employers the ability to maintain a more formal structure for their workforce.\n\nThese work arrangements are more likely to become more popular with current trends towards greater customization of services and virtual organizing. Distributed work offers great potential for firms to reduce costs, enhance competitive advantage and agility, access a greater variety of scarce talents, and improve employee flexibility, effectiveness and productivity.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1287/mnsc.38.12.1687|title=An Emerging Distributed Work Arrangement: An Investigation of Computer-Based Supplemental Work at Home|year=1992|last1=Venkatesh|first1=Alladi|last2=Vitalari|first2=Nicholas P.|journal=Management Science|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1687\u20131706}}</ref><ref>Korte, W.

While increasing in importance, distributed work has not yet gained widespread acceptance in Asia.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/tem.2004.830859|title=Effects of Environmental Uncertainty on Organizational Intention to Adopt Distributed Work Arrangements|year=2004|last1=Sia|first1=Choon-Ling|last2=Teo|first2=Hock-Hai|last3=Tan|first3=B.C.Y.|last4=Wei|first4=Kwok-Kee|journal=IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management|volume=51|issue=3|pages=253\u2013267}}</ref>\n\n===Remote office centers===\n[[Remote office center]]s (ROCs) are distributed centers for leasing offices to individuals from multiple companies.  A remote office center provides professional grade network access, phone system, security system, mail stop and optional services for additional costs.  ROCs are generally located in areas near to where people live throughout population centers, so that workers do not have to commute more than a couple of miles.  The telecommuter works in a real office but accesses the company network across the internet using a VPN just as in traditional telecommuting.\n\nThis type of arrangement does not share fully in the benefits of home-based telecommuting, but can address the needs of employees who are unable or unwilling to work from home.\n\n===Information Security for Teleworkers===\n\"To hackers who make a living stealing information from unsecured computers and network connections, the teleworker could be an open the door to the organization\u2019s most sensitive data. Security and privacy have become increasingly rare commodities these days thanks to the ability of hackers to stay one step ahead of just about every security measure that technicians can create.  Security breaches are a significant enough threat in a standard office environment; however, when an organization has employees working from home or on the go, these risks become even greater.\n\nIt is vital for organizations to convey to teleworkers that data protection and information security are important to an organization, and employees\u2019 actions make a difference in achieving the overall goal of protection of sensitive data. Despite increased awareness and training on security issues, many employees do not take the necessary precautions for deterring security risks.\n\nReal security begins with security policy. The Information Security professional must ensure that the security policy covers telecommuting/teleworking and who may telework, services available to teleworkers, information restrictions, identification/authentication/authorization, equipment and software specifications, integrity and confidentiality, maintenance guidelines, and robust user education.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Improving Information Security for Teleworkers |first=Tim |last=Godlove |url=https://www.ufairfax.edu/news/Improving-Information-Security-for-Teleworkers-20170113-0022 |publisher=University of Fairfax }}</ref>\n\n===Other countries===\nAccording to an article from the ''New York Times'', telecommuting now takes about 2.6 percent of the American workforce not including remote works like drivers. The article also mentions an experiment done by Nicholas Bloom. Nicholas Bloom is an economics professor from Stanford University. During this experiment, 250 workers were picked randomly from Ctrip to work either at home or at an office. Ctrip is a large China travel agency.  The result showed that those who telecommuted worked longer hours than those who worked at an office. The telecommuters were also more productive and happier. Ctrip saved around 2K from telecommuting. Although the quitting rate decreased for telecommuters, the promotion rate also decreased. Many telecommuters asked to be back in the office at the end with reasoning like loneliness and desire for promotion. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, came to the conclusion that most workers prefer telecommuting and office work combined. Telecommuting increases efficiency and workers\u2019 flexibility.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yee|first1=Marilynn K.|title=It's Unclearly Defined, but Telecommuting Is Fast on the Rise|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/your-money/when-working-in-your-pajamas-is-more-productive.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nAmerica has an increasing trend of using teleworking  due to its strong economics and multimedia services.

An article from money.163.com states that the number of telecommuters in the Asia pacific region exceeds region like America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Asia Pacific region has about 37% telecommuters while the others have about 23-4%.{{Dubious |reason=What does 23-4% mean? There must be an error, please correct it if you know what should actually be there.|date=September 2017}} Chinese citizens also favor the combination of telecommuting and office work due to reason like disturbance at work and increase in flexibility.<ref>{{cite news|title=\u4e2d\u56fd\u5458\u5de5\u66f4\u7231\u8fdc\u7a0b\u529e\u516c\uff1f|url=http://money.163.com/13/0726/01/94M289L100253B0H.html|date=2013-07-26}}</ref> Not all workers have the chance to telecommute. One of the ethical issues behind telecommuting is who should have the chance to telecommute? One may have more chance to work at home because he/she has young children. The other one may argue he/she also has personal problems. It is favored by most workers to combine telecommuting and office work. Many think that telecommuting once or twice a week is a reasonable schedule. Businesses also favor this suggestion because workers are more satisfied and companies save money from it.\n\n===Effects of 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic===\nAnalysts have suggested that the ongoing [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]] could be a \"tipping point\" for telecommuting.<ref>https://www.geekwire.com/2020/coronavirus-tipping-point-finally-telecommuting/</ref> In [[Seattle]], [[Microsoft]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Facebook]], and [[Google]] have mandated employees work from home.<ref>https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166686/coronavirus-amazon-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter-seattle-staff-remote-work</ref><ref>https://www.geekwire.com/2020/seattle-morning-traffic-disappears-amazon-microsoft-others-enforce-remote-work-policies/</ref> Others have suggested that an increase in telecommuting as a result of the outbreak could result in an expanded [[right to Internet access]] in the United States.<ref>https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-03-06/coronavirus-telecommute-work-from-home</ref>\n\n==Related terms and concepts==\n\n===Coworking===\n{{main|Coworking}}\nCoworking is a social gathering of a group of people who are still working independently, but who share a common working area as well as the synergy that can happen from working with people in the same space. Coworking facilities can range from shared space in formal offices to social areas such as a coffee shop. Entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs often cowork in shared office and workshop facilities provided by [[business incubator]]s and [[business accelerator]] organizations. In entrepreneurship, coworking allows creative start-up founders, researchers and knowledge workers to [[business network|meet and share ideas]], collaborate, share new research, and find potential partners.\n\n===Distributed work===\nDistributed work entails the conduct of organizational tasks in places that extend beyond the confines of traditional [[office]]s or workspaces. It can refer to organizational arrangements that permit or require workers to perform work more effectively at any appropriate location&mdash;such as their homes or [[customer|customers']] sites&mdash;through the application of information and communication technology. An example is [[financial planner]]s who meet clients during the client's lunchtime at the client's workplace; even though this is an out-of-the-office, meeting, the [[Internet]] enables the planner to present financial planning tools and presentations on their mobile computers. Another example is a [[publishing]] executives who recommends books and places orders for the latest book offerings to libraries and university professors from the executive's home using e-mail or an online system. If this type of distributed work replaces the worker's commute, it would be considered telecommuting. If not, it would be telework (see [[#Definition|\u00a71. Definition]]).\n\n===Hoteling===\nSome companies, particularly those where employees spend a great deal of time on the road and at remote locations, offer a [[hotdesking]] or [[hoteling]] arrangement where employees can reserve the use of a temporary traditional office, [[cubicle]] or [[meeting room]] at the company headquarters, a [[remote office center]], or other shared office facility.\n\n== {{anchor|Homeworker}}Homeworker ==\n'''Homeworkers''' or '''home workers''' are defined by the [[International Labour Organization]] as people working from their homes or from other premises of their choosing other than the workplace, for payment, which results of a product or service specified by the employer.  There are an estimated 300 million homeworkers in the world,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} though because these workers generally function in the [[informal economy]], and are seldom registered and often not contracted, exact numbers are difficult to come by.  Recently, the phenomenon of homework has grown with increased [[communication technology]], as well as changes in supply chains, particularly the development of [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] inventory systems. Homeworkers are often employed in [[piece work]].\n\nHomeworkers differ from [[entrepreneur]]s, or [[self-employed]], or [[family business]], in that they are hired by companies for specific activities or services to be done from their homes. Homeworkers do not own or operate the business they work for. Though there is a significant body of highly skilled homeworkers, particularly in [[information technology]], most homeworkers are considered low skilled labour.  Recently, working conditions have worsened for homeworkers,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} and they are becoming a point of concern for [[international development]] organizations and [[non-governmental organization]]s. {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Media richness theory]]\n* [[Work\u2013family conflict]]\n* [[Canadian Telework Association]] (CTA)\n* [[Comparison of office suites]]: the online versions of office suites mentioned there are useful for telecommuters)\n* [[Comparison of FTP client software]]: for file upload to a server\n* [[Comparison of file hosting services]]: for file upload to a server and sharing\n* [[Comparison of cross-platform instant messaging clients]]: for communication and p2p file sharing\n* [[Comparison of web conferencing software]]: for communication with groups\n* [[Corporate wiki]]\n* [[Coworking]]\n* [[Distance learning]]\n* [[Flextime]]\n* [[Home Work Convention, 1996]]\n* [[Hot desking]]\n* [[Hoteling]]\n* [[Job characteristic theory]]\n* [[Labour market flexibility]]\n* [[Outsourcing]]\n* [[Putting-out system]]\n* [[Small office/home office]]\n* [[Study (room)]]\n* [[Telecentre]]\n* [[Telecommunication]]\n* [[Virtual assistant (occupation)|Virtual assistant]]\n* [[Virtual team]]\n* [[Virtual volunteering]]\n* [[Work at home scheme]]\n* [[Work-life balance]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[John O'Duinn|O'Duinn, J.]], (2018) Distributed Teams: The Art and Practice of Working Together While Physically Apart, {{ISBN|978-1732254909}}\n* Thomas L.
