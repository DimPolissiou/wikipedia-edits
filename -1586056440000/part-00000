The original Jell-O [[gelatin]] dessert ([[genericized]] as '''jello''') is the signature of the brand.\n\nThe original gelatin dessert began in [[Le Roy, New York]], in 1881 after Pearle Bixby Wait and wife May [[trademarked]] the name for a product made from [[strawberry]], [[raspberry]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], or [[lemon]] flavoring added to sugar and granulated gelatin, which had just been [[patented]] in 1845 in its powdered form for the masses. The dessert was especially popular in the 1930s and 1950s.\n\n==Description==\nJell-O is sold prepared (ready-to-eat), or in powder form, and is available in various colors and flavors. The powder contains powdered [[gelatin]] and flavorings, including [[sugar]] or [[artificial sweetener]]s. It is dissolved in hot water, then chilled and allowed to set.  Fruit, vegetables, and whipped cream can be added to make elaborate snacks that can be molded into shapes. Jell-O is typically put in a refrigerator to set (become firm), after which it is eaten.\n\nSome non-gelatin pudding and pie-filling products are sold under the Jell-O brand. Ordinary pudding is cooked on the stove top (with milk) then eaten warm or chilled until firmly set, whereas [[instant pudding]] is mixed with cold milk and chilled. To make pie fillings, the same products are prepared with less liquid.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Original Jell-O Factory Le Roy NY Aug 10.jpg|thumb|right|Original Jell-O Factory, [[Le Roy, New York]]]]\n[[File:Original Jell-O Factory Historic Marker Le Roy NY Aug 10.JPG|thumb|right|Original Jell-O Factory Historic Marker]]\n[[Gelatin]], a protein produced from [[collagen]] extracted from boiled bones, connective tissues, and other animal products, has been a component of food, particularly desserts, since the 15th century.<ref>{{cite news|last=Purdom|first=Candace|title=Program on History of Gelatin Breaks the Mold: Shedding Light on Familiar Dessert|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-04-10/news/0104100235_1_gelatin-jell-jell-o|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=April 10, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021205618/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-04-10/news/0104100235_1_gelatin-jell-jell-o|archive-date=21 October 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nGelatin was popularized in New York in the [[Victorian era]] with spectacular and complex jelly moulds.

It proved enormously popular, and over time other pudding flavors were added such as [[vanilla]], [[tapioca]], [[coconut]], [[pistachio]], [[butterscotch]], [[egg custard]], [[Flan (pie)|flan]], and [[rice pudding]].\n\n===Baby boom===\nThough much of the elaborate and dainty tea time fare served between the 1920s and 1950s was luxurious and decorative, using fancy ingredients like [[caviar]] or [[lobster]], Jell-O became an affordable ornamental ingredient that women were able to use to create feminine, light, delicate dishes that were the standard of refined tea time fare during that period. By the Jazz Age nearly 1/3 of salad recipes in an average cookbook were gelatin-based recipes including varied fillings of fruit, vegetables or even cream cheese. \n\nTypical recipes from the early 20th century included exotic fruits like [[Common fig|fig]]s, [[Date (fruit)|date]]s and [[banana]]s, or lemon flavored jello paired with [[maraschino cherries]] and other ingredients like [[marshmallow]]s and [[almond]]s.<ref>Sherrie A. Inness, Dinner Roles: American Women and Culinary Culture, p. 62-66</ref> One sweet gelatin-based fruit dessert called only \"Good Salad\" includes vanilla pudding, [[tapioca]] pudding, pineapple, mandarin oranges and orange gelatin.

The salad, served chilled, is made from lemon gelatin, tomato soup, cream cheese, stuffed olives combined with various other ingredients and seasonings.<ref name=dmrc /> \n\nThe [[baby boom]] saw a significant increase in sales for Jell-O. Young mothers didn't have the supporting community structures of earlier generations, so marketers were quick to promote easy-to-prepare prepackaged foods. By this time, creating a Jell-O dessert required simply boiling water, combining the water with Jell-O, and putting the mixture into [[Tupperware]] molds and refrigerating it for a short time.<ref name=slate/>\n\nNew flavors were continually added and unsuccessful flavors were removed: in the 1950s and 1960s, [[apple]], [[black cherry]], [[black raspberry]], [[grape]], lemon-lime, mixed fruit, orange-[[banana]], [[pineapple]]-[[grapefruit]], [[blackberry]], strawberry-banana, tropical fruit, and more intense \"wild\" versions of the venerable strawberry, raspberry, and cherry. In 1966, the Jell-O \"No-Bake\" dessert line was launched, which allowed a [[cheesecake]] to be made in 15 minutes. In 1969, [[Jell-O 1-2-3|Jell-O 1\u22172\u22173]] (later Jell-O 1\u20222\u20223), a gelatin dessert that separated into three layers as it cooled, was unveiled. Until 1987, Jell-O 1\u20222\u20223 was readily found in grocery stores throughout most of the United States, but the dessert is now rare. In 1971 packaged prepared pudding called Jell-O Pudding Treats were introduced. Jell-O Whip 'n Chill, a [[chocolate mousse|mousse]]-style dessert, was introduced and widely promoted; it remains available in limited areas today.  A similar dessert called Jell-O Soft Swirl was introduced in 1972, flavors included Chocolate Creme, Strawberry Creme, Vanilla Creme, and Peach Creme.  [[Florence Henderson]] appeared in TV ads for this product.\n\n===Sales decline and turnaround===\n[[File:Day 18 - Still Eating The Green Jello (gifrancis).jpg|200px|thumb|right|Lime Jell-O]]\nIn 1964, the [[slogan]] \"There's always room for Jell-O\" was introduced, promoting the product as a \"light dessert\" that could easily be consumed even after a heavy meal.\n\nThroughout the 1960s through the 1980s, Jell-O's sales steadily decreased. Many Jell-O dishes, such as desserts and Jell-O salads, became special occasion foods rather than everyday items. Marketers blamed this decline on decreasing family sizes, a \"fast-paced\" lifestyle and women's increasing employment. By 1986, a market study concluded that mothers with young children rarely purchased Jell-O.<ref name=slate/>\n\nTo turn things around, Jell-O hired [[Dana Gioia]] to stop the decline. The marketing team revisited the Jell-O recipes published in past cookbooks and rediscovered Jigglers, although the original recipe did not use that name. Jigglers are Jell-O snacks molded into fun shapes and eaten as finger food. Jell-O launched a massive marketing campaign, notably featuring [[Bill Cosby]] as spokesman. The campaign was a huge success, causing a significant market gain.<ref name=slate/>\n\nCosby became the company's pudding spokesperson in 1974, and continued as the voice of Jell-O for almost thirty years. Over his tenure as the mouthpiece for the company, he helped introduce new products such as frozen Jell-O Pops (in gelatin and pudding varieties); the new Sugar-Free Jell-O, which replaced D-Zerta in 1984 and was sweetened with [[NutraSweet]]; Jell-O Jigglers concentrated [[gummi]] snacks; and Sparkling Jell-O, a carbonated version of the dessert touted as the \"Champagne of Jell-O.\" In 2010, Cosby returned as Jell-O spokesperson in an on-line web series called ''[[OBKB]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/bill-cosby-jell-o-togethe_n_578592.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100520091034/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/bill-cosby-jell-o-togethe_n_578592.html| archivedate= May 20, 2010| url-status= dead| first= Emily| last= Frederix| work=Huffington Post | title=Bill Cosby & Jell-O: Together Again | date=May 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, a Jell-O advertising campaign slogan reminded consumers, \"Don't forget\u2014you have to remember to make it.\"\n\nIn 1990, General Foods was merged into Kraft Foods by parent company [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]] (now the Altria Group). New flavors were introduced: [[watermelon]], [[blueberry]], [[cranberry]], [[margarita]], and [[pi\u00f1a colada]], among others.  In 2001, the state Senate of [[Utah]] recognized Jell-O as a favorite snack food of Utah, recognizing the  fundamental basis  of Jell-O in [[Mormon culture#cuisine|Mormon cuisine]] such as [[Jello salad|Jell-O salad]], and [[Governor of Utah|Governor]] [[Michael O.

Fresh pineapple, papaya, kiwifruit, and ginger root cannot be used because they contain enzymes that prevent gelatin from \"setting\". In the case of pineapple juice and the enzyme bromelain that it contains though, the enzyme can be inactivated without denaturing through excessive heating and thus altering the flavor by the addition of a small measured amount of capsaicin sourced from hot chilies.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38EVoUsVH1A|title=Pineapple Jelly.MPG|date=23 March 2010|work=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=12 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718213544/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38EVoUsVH1A|archive-date=18 July 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Jell-O shots==\n[[File:Tray of jello shots.jpg|thumb|Tray of jello shots]]\nAn alternative recipe calls for the addition of an [[alcoholic beverage]] to the mix, contributing approximately one third to one half of the liquid added after the gelatin has dissolved in a boil.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Jell-O shots pack a bang\n| first = Susan | last = Sampson   | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/1124775811.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=%20,%20&author=Susan+Sampson&pub=Toronto+Star&desc=Jell-O+shots+pack+a+bang&pqatl=top_retrieves | newspaper =[[The Toronto Star]] | location = Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n| date = September 9, 2006\n| page = M.4  | accessdate = August 3, 2010\n| quote = A Jell-O shot is a cocktail you can eat.\n}}</ref> A serving of the resulting mixture is called a \"Jell-O shot\" at parties.

Instead, announcer Don Wilson incorporated speeches about Jell-O into the program at appropriate places, to Jack's feigned comic annoyance. [[Lucille Ball]]'s ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'', the radio predecessor to TV's ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', was another popular program sponsored by Jell-O for much of its 124-episode run.  Ball's character Liz Cooper often opened the program with the lively greeting \"jell-o everybody!\"\n\nComedian [[Bill Cosby]] is associated with Jell-O and, more famously, Jell-O pudding, and he appeared in many commercials promoting both.

The original Jell-O [[gelatin]] dessert ([[genericized]] as '''jello''') is the signature of the brand.\n\nThe original gelatin dessert began in [[Le Roy, New York]], in 1881 after Pearle Bixby Wait and wife May [[trademarked]] the name for a product made from [[strawberry]], [[raspberry]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], or [[lemon]] flavoring added to sugar and granulated gelatin, which had just been [[patented]] in 1845 in its powdered form for the masses. The dessert was especially popular in the 1930s and 1950s.\n\n==Description==\nJell-O is sold prepared (ready-to-eat), or in powder form, and is available in various colors and flavors. The powder contains powdered [[gelatin]] and flavorings, including [[sugar]] or [[artificial sweetener]]s. It is dissolved in hot water, then chilled and allowed to set.  Fruit, vegetables, and whipped cream can be added to make elaborate snacks that can be molded into shapes. Jell-O is typically put in a refrigerator to set (become firm), after which it is eaten.\n\nSome non-gelatin pudding and pie-filling products are sold under the Jell-O brand. Ordinary pudding is cooked on the stove top (with milk) then eaten warm or chilled until firmly set, whereas [[instant pudding]] is mixed with cold milk and chilled. To make pie fillings, the same products are prepared with less liquid.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Original Jell-O Factory Le Roy NY Aug 10.jpg|thumb|right|Original Jell-O Factory, [[Le Roy, New York]]]]\n[[File:Original Jell-O Factory Historic Marker Le Roy NY Aug 10.JPG|thumb|right|Original Jell-O Factory Historic Marker]]\n[[Gelatin]], a protein produced from [[collagen]] extracted from boiled bones, connective tissues, and other animal products, has been a component of food, particularly desserts, since the 15th century.<ref>{{cite news|last=Purdom|first=Candace|title=Program on History of Gelatin Breaks the Mold: Shedding Light on Familiar Dessert|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-04-10/news/0104100235_1_gelatin-jell-jell-o|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=April 10, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021205618/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-04-10/news/0104100235_1_gelatin-jell-jell-o|archive-date=21 October 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nGelatin was popularized in New York in the [[Victorian era]] with spectacular and complex jelly moulds.

It proved enormously popular, and over time other pudding flavors were added such as [[vanilla]], [[tapioca]], [[coconut]], [[pistachio]], [[butterscotch]], [[egg custard]], [[Flan (pie)|flan]], and [[rice pudding]].\n\n===Baby boom===\nThough much of the elaborate and dainty tea time fare served between the 1920s and 1950s was luxurious and decorative, using fancy ingredients like [[caviar]] or [[lobster]], Jell-O became an affordable ornamental ingredient that women were able to use to create feminine, light, delicate dishes that were the standard of refined tea time fare during that period. By the Jazz Age nearly 1/3 of salad recipes in an average cookbook were gelatin-based recipes including varied fillings of fruit, vegetables or even cream cheese. \n\nTypical recipes from the early 20th century included exotic fruits like [[Common fig|fig]]s, [[Date (fruit)|date]]s and [[banana]]s, or lemon flavored jello paired with [[maraschino cherries]] and other ingredients like [[marshmallow]]s and [[almond]]s.<ref>Sherrie A. Inness, Dinner Roles: American Women and Culinary Culture, p. 62-66</ref> One sweet gelatin-based fruit dessert called only \"Good Salad\" includes vanilla pudding, [[tapioca]] pudding, pineapple, mandarin oranges and orange gelatin.

The salad, served chilled, is made from lemon gelatin, tomato soup, cream cheese, stuffed olives combined with various other ingredients and seasonings.<ref name=dmrc /> \n\nThe [[baby boom]] saw a significant increase in sales for Jell-O. Young mothers didn't have the supporting community structures of earlier generations, so marketers were quick to promote easy-to-prepare prepackaged foods. By this time, creating a Jell-O dessert required simply boiling water, combining the water with Jell-O, and putting the mixture into [[Tupperware]] molds and refrigerating it for a short time.<ref name=slate/>\n\nNew flavors were continually added and unsuccessful flavors were removed: in the 1950s and 1960s, [[apple]], [[black cherry]], [[black raspberry]], [[grape]], lemon-lime, mixed fruit, orange-[[banana]], [[pineapple]]-[[grapefruit]], [[blackberry]], strawberry-banana, tropical fruit, and more intense \"wild\" versions of the venerable strawberry, raspberry, and cherry. In 1966, the Jell-O \"No-Bake\" dessert line was launched, which allowed a [[cheesecake]] to be made in 15 minutes. In 1969, [[Jell-O 1-2-3|Jell-O 1\u22172\u22173]] (later Jell-O 1\u20222\u20223), a gelatin dessert that separated into three layers as it cooled, was unveiled. Until 1987, Jell-O 1\u20222\u20223 was readily found in grocery stores throughout most of the United States, but the dessert is now rare. In 1971 packaged prepared pudding called Jell-O Pudding Treats were introduced. Jell-O Whip 'n Chill, a [[chocolate mousse|mousse]]-style dessert, was introduced and widely promoted; it remains available in limited areas today.  A similar dessert called Jell-O Soft Swirl was introduced in 1972, flavors included Chocolate Creme, Strawberry Creme, Vanilla Creme, and Peach Creme.  [[Florence Henderson]] appeared in TV ads for this product.\n\n===Sales decline and turnaround===\n[[File:Day 18 - Still Eating The Green Jello (gifrancis).jpg|200px|thumb|right|Lime Jell-O]]\nIn 1964, the [[slogan]] \"There's always room for Jell-O\" was introduced, promoting the product as a \"light dessert\" that could easily be consumed even after a heavy meal.\n\nThroughout the 1960s through the 1980s, Jell-O's sales steadily decreased. Many Jell-O dishes, such as desserts and Jell-O salads, became special occasion foods rather than everyday items. Marketers blamed this decline on decreasing family sizes, a \"fast-paced\" lifestyle and women's increasing employment. By 1986, a market study concluded that mothers with young children rarely purchased Jell-O.<ref name=slate/>\n\nTo turn things around, Jell-O hired [[Dana Gioia]] to stop the decline. The marketing team revisited the Jell-O recipes published in past cookbooks and rediscovered Jigglers, although the original recipe did not use that name. Jigglers are Jell-O snacks molded into fun shapes and eaten as finger food. Jell-O launched a massive marketing campaign, notably featuring [[Bill Cosby]] as spokesman. The campaign was a huge success, causing a significant market gain.<ref name=slate/>\n\nCosby became the company's pudding spokesperson in 1974, and continued as the voice of Jell-O for almost thirty years. Over his tenure as the mouthpiece for the company, he helped introduce new products such as frozen Jell-O Pops (in gelatin and pudding varieties); the new Sugar-Free Jell-O, which replaced D-Zerta in 1984 and was sweetened with [[NutraSweet]]; Jell-O Jigglers concentrated [[gummi]] snacks; and Sparkling Jell-O, a carbonated version of the dessert touted as the \"Champagne of Jell-O.\" In 2010, Cosby returned as Jell-O spokesperson in an on-line web series called ''[[OBKB]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/bill-cosby-jell-o-togethe_n_578592.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100520091034/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/bill-cosby-jell-o-togethe_n_578592.html| archivedate= May 20, 2010| url-status= dead| first= Emily| last= Frederix| work=Huffington Post | title=Bill Cosby & Jell-O: Together Again | date=May 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, a Jell-O advertising campaign slogan reminded consumers, \"Don't forget\u2014you have to remember to make it.\"\n\nIn 1990, General Foods was merged into Kraft Foods by parent company [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]] (now the Altria Group). New flavors were introduced: [[watermelon]], [[blueberry]], [[cranberry]], [[margarita]], and [[pi\u00f1a colada]], among others.  In 2001, the state Senate of [[Utah]] recognized Jell-O as a favorite snack food of Utah, recognizing the  fundamental basis  of Jell-O in [[Mormon culture#cuisine|Mormon cuisine]] such as [[Jello salad|Jell-O salad]], and [[Governor of Utah|Governor]] [[Michael O.

Fresh pineapple, papaya, kiwifruit, and ginger root cannot be used because they contain enzymes that prevent gelatin from \"setting\". In the case of pineapple juice and the enzyme bromelain that it contains though, the enzyme can be inactivated without denaturing through excessive heating and thus altering the flavor by the addition of a small measured amount of capsaicin sourced from hot chilies.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38EVoUsVH1A|title=Pineapple Jelly.MPG|date=23 March 2010|work=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=12 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718213544/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38EVoUsVH1A|archive-date=18 July 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Jell-O shots==\n[[File:Tray of jello shots.jpg|thumb|Tray of jello shots]]\nAn alternative recipe calls for the addition of an [[alcoholic beverage]] to the mix, contributing approximately one third to one half of the liquid added after the gelatin has dissolved in a boil.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Jell-O shots pack a bang\n| first = Susan | last = Sampson   | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/1124775811.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=%20,%20&author=Susan+Sampson&pub=Toronto+Star&desc=Jell-O+shots+pack+a+bang&pqatl=top_retrieves | newspaper =[[The Toronto Star]] | location = Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n| date = September 9, 2006\n| page = M.4  | accessdate = August 3, 2010\n| quote = A Jell-O shot is a cocktail you can eat.\n}}</ref> A serving of the resulting mixture is called a \"Jell-O shot\" at parties.

Instead, announcer Don Wilson incorporated speeches about Jell-O into the program at appropriate places, to Jack's feigned comic annoyance. [[Lucille Ball]]'s ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'', the radio predecessor to TV's ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', was another popular program sponsored by Jell-O for much of its 124-episode run.  Ball's character Liz Cooper often opened the program with the lively greeting \"jell-o everybody!\"\n\nComedian [[Bill Cosby]] is associated with Jell-O and, more famously, Jell-O pudding, and he appeared in many commercials promoting both.

In the 1960s, the cast of the sitcom ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'' did a commercial with [[Carol Channing]] featuring Colonel Hogan, his men, Kommandant Klink and Sergeant Shultz having Jell-O and Dream Whip for dessert. Also, in the first few seasons of the first of Lucille Ball's two 1960s television series, ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', cast members including Vivian Vance often did commercials for Jell-O.\n\nIn 1995, Jell-O carried the tagline \"It's alive!\" and had the phrase \"J-E-L-L-OOOOOOO!\".\n\nIn August 2018, Jell-O released an [[animated series]] on [[YouTube]] and [[Amazon Video|Amazon Prime Video]] titled \"JELL-O Wobz\" in partnership with [[DreamWorksTV]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketingdive.com/news/jell-o-teams-with-dreamworkstv-on-animated-series-for-youtube-amazon-prime/529246/|title=Jell-O teams with DreamworksTV on animated series for YouTube, Amazon Prime Video|work=Marketing Dive|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180806145724/https://www.marketingdive.com/news/jell-o-teams-with-dreamworkstv-on-animated-series-for-youtube-amazon-prime/529246/|archive-date=2018-08-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|Bill Cosby in advertising}}\n\n==In culture==\nJell-O is mentioned in the 1936 popular song \"[[A Fine Romance (song)|A Fine Romance]]\"  by [[Dorothy Fields]] (with music by [[Jerome Kern]]), where it is humorously referred to as a mundane alternative to the excitement of romantic love.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Furia|first1=Philip|last2=Patterson|first2=Laurie|title=The Songs of Hollywood|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199792665|page=[https://archive.org/details/songsofhollywood0000furi/page/98 98]|url=https://archive.org/details/songsofhollywood0000furi|url-access=registration|quote=A Fine Romance song jello.|accessdate=16 February 2018|language=en|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1980, the American composer [[William Bolcom]] wrote a popular humorous song about Jell-O, \"[[Lime Jello Marshmallow Cottage Cheese Surprise]]\", satirising its use in combined sweet and savory dishes such as [[Jello salad]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bolcom|first1=William|last2=Morris|first2=Joan|title=Lime jello marshmallow cottage cheese surprise|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/80930501?selectedversion=NBD46882065|publisher=Melville, N.Y. : E.B.

It is a [[multidisciplinary approach]] of research and draws on [[environmental chemistry]], [[physics]], [[meteorology]], [[computer modeling]], [[oceanography]], [[geology]] and [[volcanology]] and other disciplines. Research is increasingly connected with other areas of study such as [[climatology]].\n\nThe composition and chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere is of importance for several reasons, but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and [[living organisms]]. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere changes as result of natural processes such as [[volcano]] emissions, [[lightning]] and bombardment by solar particles from [[solar corona|corona]]. It has also been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health, crops and ecosystems. Examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric chemistry include [[acid rain]], [[ozone depletion]], [[photochemical smog]], [[greenhouse gas]]es and [[global warming]]. Atmospheric chemists seek to understand the causes of these problems, and by obtaining a theoretical understanding of them, allow possible solutions to be tested and the effects of changes in government policy evaluated.\n\n== Atmospheric composition ==\n[[Image:Atmospheric composition Langley.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Visualisation of composition by volume of Earth's atmosphere.

The first scientific studies of atmospheric composition began in the 18th century, as chemists such as [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Henry Cavendish]] made the first measurements of the composition of the atmosphere.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries interest shifted towards trace constituents with very small concentrations. One particularly important discovery for atmospheric chemistry was the discovery of [[ozone]] by [[Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein]] in 1840.\n\nIn the 20th century atmospheric science moved on from studying the composition of air to a consideration of how the concentrations of trace gases in the atmosphere have changed over time and the chemical processes which create and destroy compounds in the air. Two particularly important examples of this were the explanation by [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[Gordon Dobson]] of how the [[ozone layer]] is created and maintained, and the explanation of [[photochemical smog]] by [[Arie Jan Haagen-Smit]]. Further studies on ozone issues led to the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry award shared between [[Paul Crutzen]], [[Mario Molina]] and [[Frank Sherwood Rowland]].<ref name= \"NobelPrize1995\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1995/press-release/ |title=Press Release - 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=October 11, 1995 |website=The Nobel Prize |publisher=Nobel Prize Org |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century the focus is now shifting again. Atmospheric chemistry is increasingly studied as one part of the [[Earth science#Earth system science|Earth system]]. Instead of concentrating on atmospheric chemistry in isolation the focus is now on seeing it as one part of a single system with the rest of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]],  [[biosphere]] and [[geosphere]]. An especially important driver for this is the links between chemistry and [[climate]] such as the effects of changing climate on the recovery of the ozone hole and vice versa but also interaction of the composition of the atmosphere with the oceans and terrestrial [[ecosystems]].\n{{multiple image |caption_align=center |align=center |width= |direction=horizontal\n|image1=M15-162b-EarthAtmosphere-CarbonDioxide-FutureRoleInGlobalWarming-Simulation-20151109.jpg\n|caption1=[[Carbon dioxide]] in [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]] if ''half'' of [[Global warming|global-warming emissions]]<ref name=\"NYT-20151110\">{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Atmospheric Greenhouse Gas Levels Hit Record, Report Says |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/science/atmospheric-greenhouse-gas-levels-hit-record-report-says.html |date=10 November 2015 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=11 November 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"AP-20151109\">{{cite news |last=Ritter |first=Karl |title=UK: In 1st, global temps average could be 1 degree C higher |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20151109/climate_countdown-greenhouse_gases-d8a21f0397.html |date=9 November 2015 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=11 November 2015 }}</ref> are ''not'' absorbed.<br>([[NASA]] [[Computer simulation|simulation]]; 9 November 2015)\n|width1=345\n|image2=15-233-Earth-GlobalAirQuality-2014NitrogenDioxideLevels-20151214.jpg\n|caption2=[[Nitrogen dioxide]] 2014 - global air quality levels<br>(released 14 December 2015).<ref name=\"NASA-20151214\">{{cite web |last1=Cole |first1=Steve |last2=Gray |first2=Ellen |title=New NASA Satellite Maps Show Human Fingerprint on Global Air Quality |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/new-nasa-satellite-maps-show-human-fingerprint-on-global-air-quality |date=14 December 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=14 December 2015 }}</ref>\n|width2=300\n}}\n\n== Methodology ==\nObservations, lab measurements, and modeling are the three central elements in atmospheric chemistry. Progress in atmospheric chemistry is often driven by the interactions between these components and they form an integrated whole. For example, observations may tell us that more of a chemical compound exists than previously thought possible. This will stimulate new modelling and laboratory studies which will increase our scientific understanding to a point where the observations can be explained.\n\n=== Observation ===\nObservations of atmospheric chemistry are essential to our understanding. Routine observations of chemical composition tell us about changes in atmospheric composition over time. One important example of this is the [[Keeling Curve]] - a series of measurements from 1958 to today which  show a steady rise in of the concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] (see also [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere#Ongoing measurements of atmospheric CO2|ongoing measurements of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>]]). Observations of atmospheric chemistry are made in observatories such as that on [[Mauna Loa]] and on mobile platforms such as aircraft (e.g. the UK's [[Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements]]), ships and balloons. Observations of atmospheric composition are increasingly made by [[satellites]] with important instruments such as [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|GOME]] and [[MOPITT]] giving a global picture of air pollution and chemistry. Surface observations have the advantage that they provide long term records at high time resolution but are limited in the vertical and horizontal space they provide observations from. Some surface based instruments e.g. [[LIDAR]] can provide concentration profiles of chemical compounds and aerosol but are still restricted in the horizontal region they can cover. Many observations are available on line in [[Atmospheric Chemistry Observational Databases]].\n\n=== Laboratory studies ===\nMeasurements made in the laboratory are essential to our understanding of the sources and sinks of pollutants and naturally occurring compounds. These experiments are performed in controlled environments that allow for the individual evaluation of specific chemical reactions or the assessment of properties of a particular atmospheric constituent.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Future of Atmospheric Research: Remembering Yesterday, Understanding Today, Anticipating Tomorrow|vauthors = ((National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine))|publisher=The National Academies Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-309-44565-8|location=Washington, DC|pages=15|via=}}</ref> Types of analysis that are of interest includes both those on gas-phase reactions, as well as [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] reactions that are relevant to the formation and growth of [[aerosol]]s. Also of high importance is the study of atmospheric [[photochemistry]] which quantifies how the rate in which molecules are split apart by sunlight and what resulting products are. In addition, [[thermodynamic]] data such as [[Henry's law]] coefficients can also be obtained.\n\n=== Modeling ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nIn order to synthesise and test theoretical understanding of atmospheric chemistry, computer models (such as [[chemical transport model]]s) are used. Numerical models solve the differential equations governing the concentrations of chemicals in the atmosphere. They can be very simple or very complicated. One common trade off in numerical models is between the number of chemical compounds and chemical reactions modeled versus the representation of transport and mixing in the atmosphere. For example, a box model might include hundreds or even thousands of chemical reactions but will only have a very crude representation of mixing in the atmosphere. In contrast, 3D models represent many of the physical processes of the atmosphere but due to constraints on computer resources will have far fewer chemical reactions and compounds. Models can be used to interpret observations, test understanding of chemical reactions and predict future concentrations of chemical compounds in the atmosphere. One important current trend is for atmospheric chemistry modules to become one part of earth system models in which the links between climate, atmospheric composition and the biosphere can be studied.\n\nSome models are constructed by automatic code generators (e.g. [[Autochem]] or [[Kinetic PreProcessor]]). In this approach a set of constituents are chosen and the automatic code generator will then select the reactions involving those constituents from a set of reaction databases. Once the reactions have been chosen the [[ordinary differential equations]] that describe their time evolution can be automatically constructed.\n\n==See also==\n{{Weather}}\n* [[Oxygen cycle]]\n* [[Ozone-oxygen cycle]]\n* [[Paleoclimatology]]\n* [[Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion]]\n* [[Tropospheric ozone depletion events]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Brasseur, Guy P.; Orlando, John J.; Tyndall, Geoffrey S.

It is a [[multidisciplinary approach]] of research and draws on [[environmental chemistry]], [[physics]], [[meteorology]], [[computer modeling]], [[oceanography]], [[geology]] and [[volcanology]] and other disciplines. Research is increasingly connected with other areas of study such as [[climatology]].\n\nThe composition and chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere is of importance for several reasons, but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and [[living organisms]]. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere changes as result of natural processes such as [[volcano]] emissions, [[lightning]] and bombardment by solar particles from [[corona]]. It has also been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health, crops and ecosystems. Examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric chemistry include [[acid rain]], [[ozone depletion]], [[photochemical smog]], [[greenhouse gas]]es and [[global warming]]. Atmospheric chemists seek to understand the causes of these problems, and by obtaining a theoretical understanding of them, allow possible solutions to be tested and the effects of changes in government policy evaluated.\n\n== Atmospheric composition ==\n[[Image:Atmospheric composition Langley.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Visualisation of composition by volume of Earth's atmosphere.

The first scientific studies of atmospheric composition began in the 18th century, as chemists such as [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Henry Cavendish]] made the first measurements of the composition of the atmosphere.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries interest shifted towards trace constituents with very small concentrations. One particularly important discovery for atmospheric chemistry was the discovery of [[ozone]] by [[Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein]] in 1840.\n\nIn the 20th century atmospheric science moved on from studying the composition of air to a consideration of how the concentrations of trace gases in the atmosphere have changed over time and the chemical processes which create and destroy compounds in the air. Two particularly important examples of this were the explanation by [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[Gordon Dobson]] of how the [[ozone layer]] is created and maintained, and the explanation of [[photochemical smog]] by [[Arie Jan Haagen-Smit]]. Further studies on ozone issues led to the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry award shared between [[Paul Crutzen]], [[Mario Molina]] and [[Frank Sherwood Rowland]].<ref name= \"NobelPrize1995\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1995/press-release/ |title=Press Release - 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=October 11, 1995 |website=The Nobel Prize |publisher=Nobel Prize Org |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century the focus is now shifting again.

Very small tsunamis, non-destructive and undetectable without specialized equipment, occur frequently as a result of minor earthquakes and other events.\n\nAround 1600 [[BCE]], a tsunami caused by [[Minoan eruption|the eruption]] of [[Thira]] devastated the [[Minoan civilization]] on [[Crete]] and related cultures in the [[Cyclades]], as well as in areas on the Greek mainland facing the eruption, such as the [[Argolid]].\n\nThe oldest recorded tsunami occurred in 479 BCE.

Within minutes, the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] issued a tsunami warning that was broadcast on [[NHK]] in English and Japanese (archived at [https://web.archive.org/web/20071214051020/http://library.skr.jp/19930712_nanseioki.htm NHK library]). However, at [[Okushiri, Hokkaido|Okushiri]], a small island near the epicenter, some waves reaching 30 meters struck within two to five minutes of the quake. Despite being surrounded by tsunami barriers, Aonae, a village on a low-lying peninsula, was struck over the following hour by 13 waves over two meters high arriving from multiple directions, including waves that bounced back off Hokkaido. Of 250 people killed as a result of the quake, 197 were victims of the tsunami that hit Okushiri; the waves also caused deaths on Hokkaido. While many residents, remembering the 1983 tsunami (see above), survived by evacuating on foot, many others underestimated how soon the waves would arrive (the 1983 tsunami took 17 minutes to hit Okushiri) and were killed as they attempted to evacuate by car. The highest wave of the tsunami was 31 meters (102&nbsp;ft) high.\n|-\n| 1994 || Java earthquake || [[1994 Java earthquake]] || Earthquake || Two hundred and fifty killed as a M7.8 earthquake and tsunami affected east Java and Bali on 3 June 1994.\n|-\n| 1998 || Papua New Guinea || [[1998 Papua New Guinea earthquake]] || Earthquake || On 17 July 1998, a [[Papua New Guinea]] tsunami killed approximately 2,200 people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/tsunami/PNG.html |title=Tsunamis and Earthquakes \u2013 1998 Papua New Guinea tsunami Descriptive Model \u2013 USGS WCMG |publisher=Walrus.wr.usgs.gov |accessdate=11 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817230204/http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/tsunami/PNG.html# |archive-date=17 August 2007 |url-status=live  }}</ref> A 7.1-magnitude earthquake 24&nbsp;km offshore was followed within 11 minutes by a tsunami about 15 metres tall.

The earthquake was the [[List of earthquakes#Largest earthquakes by magnitude|third largest earthquake]] in recorded history. The initial surge was measured at a height of approximately {{convert|33|m|ft|sp=us}}, making it the largest earthquake-generated tsunami in recorded history. The tsunami killed people from the immediate vicinity of the [[epicenter|quake]] in Indonesia, Thailand, and the north-west coast of Malaysia, to thousands of kilometres away in Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and as far away as Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania. This trans-Indian Ocean tsunami is an example of a [[teletsunami]], which travels vast distances across the open ocean, and an [[ocean-wide tsunami]]. It became known as the \"Boxing Day Tsunami\" because it struck on [[Boxing Day]] (26 December).\n\nUnlike in the [[Pacific Ocean]], there was no organized alert service covering the [[Indian Ocean]]. This was in part due to the absence of major tsunami events since 1883 (the [[Krakatoa]] eruption, see above). In light of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, [[UNESCO]] and other world bodies have called for an international [[tsunami warning system|tsunami monitoring system]].\n|-\n| 2006 || South of Java Island || [[2006 Pangandaran earthquake and tsunami]] || Earthquake || A 7.7 [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] earthquake rocked the Indian Ocean seabed on 17 July 2006, 200&nbsp;km south of [[Pangandaran]], a beach famous to surfers for its perfect waves. This earthquake triggered tsunamis with heights that varied from 2 meters at [[Cilacap]] to 6 meters at [[Cimerak]] beach, where it swept away and flattened buildings as far as 400 metres away from the coastline. More than 800 people were reported missing or dead.\n|-\n| 2006 || Kuril Islands || [[2006 Kuril Islands earthquake]] || Earthquake || On 15 November 2006, a magnitude 8.3 earthquake occurred off the coast near the Kuril Islands. In spite of the quake's large 8.3 magnitude, a relatively small tsunami was generated. This tsunami was recorded or observed in Japan and at distant locations throughout the Pacific.\n|-\n| 2007 || Solomon Islands || [[2007 Solomon Islands earthquake]] || Earthquake || On 2 April 2007, a magnitude 8.1 earthquake struck about {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Ghizo Island in the western [[Solomon Islands]] at 7:39&nbsp;a.m., resulting in a tsunami that was up to 12 m (36&nbsp;feet) high. The wave, which struck the coast of Solomon Islands (mainly [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]], Ghizo Island, [[Ranongga]], and [[Simbo]]), triggered tsunami warnings and watches extending from Japan to New Zealand to Hawaii and eastern Australia. The tsunami killed 52 people and dozens were injured when waves inundated towns. A state of national emergency was declared for the Solomon Islands. On the island of [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]], a wall of water reported to be 9.1 m (30&nbsp;feet) high swept almost 400 meters inland. The largest waves hit the northern tip of [[Simbo]] Island, where two villages, Tapurai and Riquru, were completely destroyed by a 12 m wave, killing 10 people. Officials estimate that the tsunami displaced more than 5000 residents throughout the archipelago.\n|-\n| 2007 || Chile || [[2007 Ays\u00e9n Fjord earthquake]] || Earthquake and landslide || On 21 April 2007, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake occurred in the [[Ays\u00e9n Fjord]]. On the mountains around the fjord, the [[earthquake]] caused [[landslide]]s that in turn created waves as high as six meters, which severely damaged some [[salmon]] [[aquaculture]] installations. The potable water systems of the cities of [[Puerto Chacabuco, Chile|Puerto Chacabuco]] and [[Puerto Ais\u00e9n, Chile|Puerto Ais\u00e9n]] were broken, forcing [[firefighters]] and the [[army of Chile|army]] to supply water. The electricity network of [[Puerto Chacabuco]] was also cut off. Ten people were reported dead or missing.\n|-\n| 2007 || British Columbia ||  || Landslide || On 4 December 2007, a landslide entered [[Chehalis Lake]] in British Columbia, generating a large lake tsunami that destroyed campgrounds and vegetation many meters above the shoreline.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256662926|first1=Nicholas|title=Landslide Science and Practice|last1=Roberts|first2=Robin|last2=J.

Beginning at 350m over water height, it caused a tsunami 20\u201330 meters high across the caldera, and potentially larger at localized points of impact. Thanks to the late hour, no tourists were present; however, search and rescue observed a steam cloud rising from the volcano, apparently geothermal steam released by the landslide. Whether geothermal activity played a role in the landslide is uncertain.

They are possible wherever large bodies of water are found, including inland lakes, where they can be caused by landslides and glacier calving. Very small tsunamis, non-destructive and undetectable without specialized equipment, occur frequently as a result of minor earthquakes and other events.\n\nAround 1600 [[BCE]], a tsunami caused by [[Minoan eruption|the eruption]] of [[Thira]] devastated the [[Minoan civilization]] on [[Crete]] and related cultures in the [[Cyclades]], as well as in areas on the Greek mainland facing the eruption, such as the [[Argolid]].\n\nThe oldest recorded tsunami occurred in 479 BCE. It destroyed a [[Persian Empire|Persian]] army that was attacking the town of [[Potidaea]] in Greece.<ref name=\"Smid\">Smid, T.

The impact in the waters of Gilbert Inlet generated a local tsunami that crashed against the southwest shoreline and swept over the spur separating Gilbert Inlet from the main Lituya Bay. The wave continued down Lituya Bay, over La Chaussee Spit and into the Gulf of Alaska. The force of the wave removed all trees and vegetation from as high as 1720 feet (524 meters) above sea level. This is the highest wave ever recorded. The scale of this wave was so much greater than ordinary tsunamis, it eventually led to the new category of ''megatsunamis''. \n     \n|-\n| 1960 || Valdivia, Chile, and Pacific Ocean || [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]] or Great Chilean earthquake || Earthquake || The magnitude-9.5 earthquake of 22 May 1960, the largest earthquake ever recorded, generated one of the most destructive tsunamis of the 20th century. The tsunami spread across the Pacific Ocean, with waves measuring up to 25 meters (82 feet) high in places. The first tsunami wave struck at [[Hilo, Hawaii]], approximately 14.8 hrs after it originated. The highest wave at Hilo Bay was measured at ~10.7&nbsp;m (35&nbsp;ft). 61 lives were lost, allegedly due to people's failure to heed warning sirens. Almost 22 hours after the quake, waves up to 3 m above high tide hit the Sanriku coast of Japan, killing 142 people.

The earthquake was the [[List of earthquakes#Largest earthquakes by magnitude|third largest earthquake]] in recorded history. The initial surge was measured at a height of approximately {{convert|33|m|ft|sp=us}}, making it the largest earthquake-generated tsunami in recorded history. The tsunami killed people from the immediate vicinity of the [[epicenter|quake]] in Indonesia, Thailand, and the north-west coast of Malaysia, to thousands of kilometres away in Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and as far away as Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania. This trans-Indian Ocean tsunami is an example of a [[teletsunami]], which travels vast distances across the open ocean, and an [[ocean-wide tsunami]]. It became known as the \"Boxing Day Tsunami\" because it struck on [[Boxing Day]] (26 December).\n\nUnlike in the [[Pacific Ocean]], there was no organized alert service covering the [[Indian Ocean]]. This was in part due to the absence of major tsunami events since 1883 (the [[Krakatoa]] eruption, see above). In light of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, [[UNESCO]] and other world bodies have called for an international [[tsunami warning system|tsunami monitoring system]].\n|-\n| 2006 || South of Java Island || [[2006 Pangandaran earthquake and tsunami]] || Earthquake || A 7.7 [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] earthquake rocked the Indian Ocean seabed on 17 July 2006, 200&nbsp;km south of [[Pangandaran]], a beach famous to surfers for its perfect waves. This earthquake triggered tsunamis with heights that varied from 2 meters at [[Cilacap]] to 6 meters at [[Cimerak]] beach, where it swept away and flattened buildings as far as 400 metres away from the coastline.

The wave, which struck the coast of Solomon Islands (mainly [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]], Ghizo Island, [[Ranongga]], and [[Simbo]]), triggered tsunami warnings and watches extending from Japan to New Zealand to Hawaii and eastern Australia. The tsunami killed 52 people and dozens were injured when waves inundated towns. A state of national emergency was declared for the Solomon Islands. On the island of [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]], a wall of water reported to be 9.1 m (30&nbsp;feet) high swept almost 400 meters inland. The largest waves hit the northern tip of [[Simbo]] Island, where two villages, Tapurai and Riquru, were completely destroyed by a 12 m wave, killing 10 people.

Solar wind parameters were measured for a much longer time period. The [[spacecraft]] is spin-stabilized at two different rates (5 and 0.2 rpm). [[Hydrazine]] thrusters are used for attitude and velocity control; [[star]] and sun sensors are for attitude control; and a mechanically despun off-set [[parabolic dish]] is used for long range [[communication]].\n\n==Launch==\n''Suisei'' was launched on August 18, 1985 by [[Mu (rocket)|M-3SII-2]] launch vehicle from [[Kagoshima Space Center]].  It was sent on an intercept course with Comet Halley, after which it would remain in a [[heliocentric orbit]] for later use as long as it was viable.\n\n==Halley encounter==\n''Suisei'' began UV [[observations]] in November 1985, generating up to 6 images/day.\n\nThe spacecraft encountered Comet Halley at 151,000&nbsp;km on sunward side during March 8, 1986, suffering only 2 dust impacts.\n\n==Earth flyby==\nFifteen burns of ''Suisei''{{'}}s 3 N motors during the period of April 5&ndash;10, 1987, yielded a 65&nbsp;m/s velocity increase for a 60,000&nbsp;km [[Earth]] [[gravity assist]] swingby on August 20, 1992, although the craft was then lost behind the Sun for the [[summer]].\n\nThe [[hydrazine]] fuel was depleted on February 22, 1991.

The series was named \"[[BFGoodrich]] Langstreckenmeisterschaft (BFGLM)\" from 2001 to 2009. \n\nParticipants of VLN races range from amateurs in small road legal cars with rollcages and harnesses to professional factory teams racing [[Group GT3]] cars. The VLN series is closely associated with the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]], as it has similar rules (mostly), and mainly the same participants. In the calendar, several weeks around the 24h date in May/June are taken off to allow teams to prepare for the 24h, and to fix their cars afterwards. The 24h is not part of the championship anymore, though.\n\n[[File:VLN-BFGoodrich Langstreckenmeisterschaft N\u00fcrburgring.jpg|thumb|Touring cars passing in front of the N\u00fcrburg]]\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT3 VLN 8 2010.JPG|thumb|[[Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG#SLS AMG GT3|Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG]] GT3 on the 'Ring]]\n\n==History==\nThe VLN was founded in 1977 by several [[motorsport]] clubs, which are members of [[ADAC]] or [[Deutscher Motorsport Verband]] (DMV), in order to join forces. Previously, each club had run its own [[touring car racing]] event on the N\u00fcrburgring, lasting for 3.5 to 6 hours, with about 150 cars and 400 drivers taking part. The rules were unified and the races were made part of a series.\n\nThe winners of the series were awarded a Cup (German ''Pokal''), sponsored by [[Ashland Inc.#Ashland Consumer Markets (Valvoline)|Valvoline]] and later Veedol lubrication products. Due to this, both organisation and races were simply informally called \"Veedol-Cup\" for many years. Since the change of sponsorship and the official recognition by [[Deutscher Motor Sport Bund]] (DMSB) as the German endurance championship (German ''Meisterschaft'') in 2001, the former ''Veedol Langstreckenpokal N\u00fcrburgring'' was the ''BFGoodrich Langstreckenmeisterschaft N\u00fcrburgring''. The name of the VLN organisation stays the same, though, which is reflected by their website addresses and title.\n\nApart from the 24 Hours, the [[Rundstrecken Challenge N\u00fcrburgring|Rundstrecken Challenge N\u00fcrburgring (RCN/CHC)]] and [[Gleichm\u00e4\u00dfigkeitspr\u00fcfung|GLP]] are related smaller events dedicated to non-professionals.\n\n==Races==\nEach VLN race is held as a \"one-day event\" on Saturdays only, in order to limit costs. The mandatory drivers briefing is at 07:30, practice is from 08:20 to 10:00, following a warmup lap behind safety cars, the first of three groups starts the race at 12:00, followed by the other two a few minutes later, in time before the fastest cars complete their first lap in just over 8 minutes. After [[parc ferm\u00e9]] is opened and the winners are honoured, the teams can travel home on race day. At some events, the schedule also accommodates additional sprint races of visiting other series, mainly [[classic car]]s and youngtimers.\n\nThe \"N\u00fcrburgring 6 Hours\" is considered the season highlight \u2013 in 1998, even Sir [[Jack Brabham]] took part, at age 72. Here, 2 to 4 drivers per cars are entered, while in all others races, a single driver can drive all alone for 4 hours, or up to 3 can form a team. There are two other standout races \u2013 the VLN-6 \"Barbarossapreis\", in which [[Michael Schumacher]]'s success with [[Scuderia Ferrari]] in [[Formula One]] is honoured with all podium placegetters receiving red wigs; and the VLN-9 \"M\u00fcnsterlandpokal\" or \"Schinkenrennen\" (ham race), where large pieces of [[ham]] from the [[M\u00fcnster]]land area are presented to class winners.\n\nMost of the fans watch the race on the Nordschleife. To get to the favourite viewing points it is often necessary to take a walk. Several sections, including \"Schwedenkreuz\", \"Adenauer Forst\", \"Karussell\", and \"Wippermann\", are up to a kilometer away from the nearest main road. Easy to reach and always well attended are sections such as \"Breidscheid\", \"Br\u00fcnnchen\", and \"Pflanzgarten\". Around the whole Nordschleife no entrance fee is raised. Just for the paddock and the grandstands on the Grand Prix circuit of the N\u00fcrburgring tickets for the price of 18 \u20ac are required.\n\n==Car classes==\nA variety of cars compete at the same time during each race. In the 2009 season, there were 30 classes of cars in four divisions.\n*The '''Series Cars''' division is intended to allow relatively low cost racing with near-series cars. It consists of six gasoline classes differentiated by engine displacement V1 to V6 and a diesel class VD.\n*The '''Specials''' division consists of pure race cars that may compete in other race series. It consists of the classes SP1 to SP8 differentiated by engine displacement with an optional suffix T for turbo charged engines, the SP9 class for FIA GT3 cars, the SP10 class for SRO GT4 cars, the special E1-XP 2009 class and the D1T to D4T classes differentiated by engine displacement for diesel cars.\n*The '''Cup''' division consists of one-make cup cars in the classes Cup1: Seat Leon, Cup2: Honda Civic R, Cup3: Porsche Carrera Cup.\n*The '''H''' division consists of cars made in 1996 and before. It consists of the classes H1 to H4 differentiated by engine displacement.\n\n==Member organisations==\n*ADAC-[[Westphalia|Westfalen]] e.V.\n*Renngemeinschaft [[D\u00fcren]] e.V.

The series was named \"[[BFGoodrich]] Langstreckenmeisterschaft (BFGLM)\" from 2001 to 2009. \n\nParticipants of VLN races range from amateurs in small road legal cars with rollcages and harnesses to professional factory teams racing [[Group GT3]] cars. The VLN series is closely associated with the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]], as it has similar rules (mostly), and mainly the same participants. In the calendar, several weeks around the 24h date in May/June are taken off to allow teams to prepare for the 24h, and to fix their cars afterwards. The 24h is not part of the championship anymore, though.\n\n[[File:VLN-BFGoodrich Langstreckenmeisterschaft N\u00fcrburgring.jpg|thumb|Touring cars passing in front of the N\u00fcrburg]]\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT3 VLN 8 2010.JPG|thumb|[[Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG#SLS AMG GT3|Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG]] GT3 on the 'Ring]]\n\n==History==\nThe VLN was founded in 1977 by several [[motorsport]] clubs, which are members of [[ADAC]] or [[Deutscher Motorsport Verband]] (DMV), in order to join forces.

She writes about her husband Steve's job promotion, her daughter Frankie's art, and her son Nick's early admission to Harvard University. MJ writes that she got into a car crash, but is healing with the help of natural remedies, like hot yoga.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/alanis-morissette-musical-jagged-little-pill-review|title=The Alanis Morissette Musical Is Just Chaotic Enough To Capture 2018|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref> What she doesn't write is that Steve is addicted to pornography, Frankie is making out with her best friend, Jo, as this letter is being written, and MJ is addicted to the painkillers from the car accident (\"Right Through You\"). One morning before breakfast, Steve complains about MJ's refusal to be intimate. At breakfast, MJ reprimands Frankie for wearing revealing shorts. Frankie is mad that they noticed her shorts, but not her sign for a protest she organized. MJ pressures Nick to be perfect to keep up the family's image (\"All I Really Want\"). At school, Nick's friends congratulate him on his acceptance to Harvard and tell him that he should come to a party that night to celebrate. Frankie and Jo discuss how their mothers don't understand or accept them: Frankie's because of her disapproval of her self expression and Jo's mom not accepting her being gay or her gender expression (\"Hand in My Pocket\").\n\nMJ goes to a pharmacy to get a refill on her prescription for her painkillers. The pharmacist says that she needs a new prescription in order for them to fill it. MJ then calls a drug dealer to get her the painkillers instead. MJ moves through her day backwards, starting with getting the drugs in the alley, then doing her daily activities, and ending with her running out of the pills at the beginning of the day (\"Smiling\"). On the last day of Frankie's English class before winter break, she reads a short story she wrote aloud in a writer's workshop for her class to critique. The students in the class interrupt and criticize her for stating that the things she claims to be ironic in her piece are not actually ironic, just bad things that happened to someone. A new student, Phoenix, defends Frankie and encourages her to finish (\"Ironic\"). A romantic attraction begins between the two, and Phoenix states that he is single. After class, Phoenix and Frankie decide to go to the party that night. At home, Steve calls MJ to say that he is stuck at work. MJ and Steve get into an argument. Steve says he wants to see a marriage counselor, yet MJ refuses (\"So Unsexy\"). Nick comforts MJ after the fight. MJ claims that Nick is the only thing that she has ever done right. MJ asks Nick to watch a movie with her. He tells her that he is going to a party with Frankie. MJ claims that parties are 'not his scene' but still encourages him to go, and Nick reflects on the pressures of him from his mother to be perfect (\"Perfect\").\n\nFrankie and Nick go to the party (\"Lancer's Party (So Pure)\"). Frankie and Phoenix find each other and leave the crowded party to talk alone, and they discuss their imperfect family lives. Frankie feels like her black identity is being erased by her adoptive white family. Phoenix's dad left when he was young and never calls, and Phoenix has to help his mom take care of his sister with a medical condition. Meanwhile, Jo couldn't attend the party because their mom forced them to go to a church function. Jo is scolded by her mom and church for being gay and not dressing femininely enough (\"That I Would Be Good\"). Phoenix asks Frankie if she has a boyfriend, and she says that she doesn't. The next morning at school, Jo and Frankie discuss how both of their nights were not fun and didn't go as planned. Jo brings up Phoenix and his crush on Frankie, but Frankie brushes it off and doesn't mention her talk with him at the party. Jo shows Frankie pictures that are circulating throughout the school of Bella, Nick's friend, who was drunk, passed out, and had her shirt pulled up at the party. Students are making fun of Bella and calling her a slut. Frankie and Jo go to Bella's house, despite barely knowing her, to check on her. Bella reveals that Andrew, Nick's best friend, was the one who took the pictures and raped her, but no one believes her. Frankie and Jo tell Bella they believe her. Frankie goes home and wakes Nick up to reprimand him about going to the police since he was the only witness of Bella at the party. Nick brushes off Bella's claim, saying that she was drunk and being dramatic per usual. MJ overhears the conversation and insists that Nick can't come forward as it might ruin his reputation. MJ blames Bella for what happened, saying that this situation is super common, but she is visibly upset by the story and leaves the house to get some air (\"Wake Up\"). MJ walks to the church for the first time in a while to pray about her failing marriage, struggling relationship with Frankie, and for help with her addiction. She then reflects on her own memory of being raped in college, but blames herself and feels it was God's plan for her (\"Forgiven\").\n\n'''Act II'''\n\nSteve finally convinces MJ to go to their first marriage counseling session, despite her reluctance (\"Not the Doctor\"). Steve reveals that he and MJ have not had sex for over a year. MJ says that they don't need sex since Steve is constantly watching porn. The therapist wonders if MJ's car accident may have triggered memories of past sexual trauma, but MJ insists she does not have any sexual trauma. Steve states that he appreciates MJ for all she does for him and the family, and he tells her that he misses her and the way they used to be. Meanwhile, Frankie and Phoenix sing to each other and end up sleeping together (\"Head over Feet\"). Jo walks into the Healy's house uninvited (\"Your House\") and walks in on Frankie and Phoenix. Jo gets mad and storms out of the house. On her way out, she runs into MJ and Steve fighting while coming home from therapy. Jo tells them that Frankie just had sex with Phoenix. Phoenix leaves quickly, leaving Frankie alone with her parents. MJ and Steve reprimand her for having sex so young. Frankie comes out to her parents as bisexual, and she gets mad at her parents for being disapproving of her consensual sex while they don't care about Bella's rape. Frankie says that she's not actually their daughter since she was adopted and blames her parents for only seeing her as who they want her to be, not who she really is. Frankie decides to run away to New York City. Steve and MJ get into another fight about Steve not being present during Frankie's childhood. Frankie takes a train alone to New York (\"Unprodigal Daughter\"). When she gets lost in the city, Frankie calls Phoenix. She tells him that she loves him and that he should come pick her up. When Phoenix doesn't say 'I love you' back and that he needs to stay at home to help his sister with her malfunctioning feeding tube, Frankie gets angry and feels that Phoenix only wants her for her body.\n\nStudents are gossiping about Bella and her accusations against Andrew. Bella comes to the Healy's house to talk to Nick, but the only person home is MJ. MJ tells Bella she was also raped in college. After Bella leaves, Nick tells MJ the entirety of what happened that night. He was in the room when Bella was unconscious and raped, but he did nothing (\"Predator\"). Nick tells his mom that he wants to go to the police, but MJ says that it would only ruin his life and not help Bella's. MJ is devastated and furious, but Nick accuses her of only caring about herself and her reputation, and not about Bella. MJ hits him. Jo comes to New York to pick up Frankie after Frankie desperately calls her, lost and out of money. She shows little remorse about sleeping with Phoenix since she didn't think her relationship with Jo was exclusive. She tells Jo that she fell in love with Phoenix. Jo says that Frankie would have told her about Phoenix if she didn't know it was wrong. Jo ends the relationship (\"You Oughta Know\"). Frankie gets a call that something is wrong with MJ. At home, MJ overdoses on her pills, and Steve and Nick find her unconscious (\"Uninvited\"). When Steve gets to the hospital, he is devastated that he didn't know how MJ had an addiction and comforts her (\"Mary Jane\"). They both agree to start to truly try to work on their marriage. When Nick gets to the hospital, MJ tells him that he should go to the police because justice for Bella is more important than her reputation, but Nick already went to the police. Meanwhile, many students attend the rally that Frankie organized for Bella. Bella is mad at Nick since people only believed her once Nick came forward, and her statement wasn't enough (\"No\").\n\nA year has passed, and MJ is writing the yearly Healy Christmas letter. She writes about Frankie's passion for social justice and her dedication to helping Bella. MJ opens up about having been a victim of sexual assault as well. Bella is finally going to tell her side of the story in court. MJ and Frankie reconcile after MJ overcomes her addiction. MJ tells Frankie that she wanted her to feel like every other kid and not be treated differently because of her race, but Frankie tells her that she will always be different (\"Thank U\"). Nick is taking a year off before college to find himself. MJ discusses that she and Steve are in therapy, both individually and together. She opens up about her overdose and treatment for her addiction to painkillers, but she has learned to see how kind the people in her life truly are. Frankie dares MJ to email the Christmas letter to everyone, and MJ sends it. She decides that this will be her last Christmas letter. Jo and Frankie rekindle their friendship, and Jo has a new girlfriend. Frankie and Phoenix are now just friends (\"You Learn\"). Seth McBride is obsessed with this musical.\n\n== Productions ==\n''Jagged Little Pill'' ran from May 5 to July 15, 2018, at the [[Loeb Drama Center]], within the [[American Repertory Theater]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americanrepertorytheater.org/events/show/jagged-little-pill|title=Jagged Little Pill Art Season|publisher=[[American Repertory Theater]]|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> The cast included Elizabeth Stanley as Mary Jane,<ref name=\"Stanley\">{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/elizabeth-stanley-to-star-in-world-premiere-of-alanis-morissettes-jagged-little-pill-musical|title=Elizabeth Stanley to Star in World Premiere of Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill Musical|date=6 March 2018|work=Playbill, playbill.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> [[Derek Klena]] as Nick,<ref name=\"casting\" /> [[Lauren Patten]] as Jo,<ref name=\"casting\" /> Sean Allan Krill as Steve<ref name=\"casting\" /> and Celia Gooding as Frankie.<ref name=\"casting\" />\n\nIn January 2019, the producers announced plans to bring the show to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in fall 2019, also directed by Paulus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/alanis-morissette-broadway-jagged-little-pill-musical-diablo-cody-diane-paulus-1202544053/amp/|title=Alanis Morissette's 'Jagged Little Pill' Musical Heading To Broadway|last=Evans|first=Greg|date=January 28, 2019|work=Deadline|accessdate=January 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/alanis-morissette-musical-jagged-little-pill-will-transfer-to-broadway|title=Alanis Morissette Musical Jagged Little Pill Will Transfer to Broadway|last=McPhee|first=Ryan|work=[[Playbill]]|accessdate=January 28, 2019}}</ref> It began previews at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] on November 3 and opened on December 5, 2019.<ref>Peikert, Mark.

Morissette also wrote two new songs for the musical, \"[[Smiling (song)|Smiling]]\" and \"Predator\", with the former being included as the second single from her ninth studio album ''[[Such Pretty Forks in the Road]]''.\n\n==Plot summary==\nInspired by the themes and emotions from Morissette's album, the musical ''Jagged Little Pill'' deals with pain, healing, and empowerment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americanrepertorytheater.org/shows-events/jagged-little-pill/|title=Jagged Little Pill\u2014Now Playing|website=A.R.T.|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref>\n \n'''Act I'''\n\nMary Jane Healy, or MJ for short, is a mother that is writing the yearly family Christmas letter, which is her way of bragging about her seemingly perfect family. She writes about her husband Steve's job promotion, her daughter Frankie's art, and her son Nick's early admission to Harvard University. MJ writes that she got into a car crash, but is healing with the help of natural remedies, like hot yoga.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/alanis-morissette-musical-jagged-little-pill-review|title=The Alanis Morissette Musical Is Just Chaotic Enough To Capture 2018|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref> What she doesn't write is that Steve is addicted to pornography, Frankie is making out with her best friend, Jo, as this letter is being written, and MJ is addicted to the painkillers from the car accident (\"Right Through You\"). One morning before breakfast, Steve complains about MJ's refusal to be intimate. At breakfast, MJ reprimands Frankie for wearing revealing shorts. Frankie is mad that they noticed her shorts, but not her sign for a protest she organized. MJ pressures Nick to be perfect to keep up the family's image (\"All I Really Want\"). At school, Nick's friends congratulate him on his acceptance to Harvard and tell him that he should come to a party that night to celebrate. Frankie and Jo discuss how their mothers don't understand or accept them: Frankie's because of her disapproval of her self expression and Jo's mom not accepting her being gay or her gender expression (\"Hand in My Pocket\").\n\nMJ goes to a pharmacy to get a refill on her prescription for her painkillers. The pharmacist says that she needs a new prescription in order for them to fill it. MJ then calls a drug dealer to get her the painkillers instead. MJ moves through her day backwards, starting with getting the drugs in the alley, then doing her daily activities, and ending with her running out of the pills at the beginning of the day (\"Smiling\"). On the last day of Frankie's English class before winter break, she reads a short story she wrote aloud in a writer's workshop for her class to critique. The students in the class interrupt and criticize her for stating that the things she claims to be ironic in her piece are not actually ironic, just bad things that happened to someone. A new student, Phoenix, defends Frankie and encourages her to finish (\"Ironic\"). A romantic attraction begins between the two, and Phoenix states that he is single. After class, Phoenix and Frankie decide to go to the party that night. At home, Steve calls MJ to say that he is stuck at work. MJ and Steve get into an argument. Steve says he wants to see a marriage counselor, yet MJ refuses (\"So Unsexy\"). Nick comforts MJ after the fight. MJ claims that Nick is the only thing that she has ever done right. MJ asks Nick to watch a movie with her. He tells her that he is going to a party with Frankie. MJ claims that parties are 'not his scene' but still encourages him to go, and Nick reflects on the pressures of him from his mother to be perfect (\"Perfect\").\n\nFrankie and Nick go to the party (\"Lancer's Party (So Pure)\"). Frankie and Phoenix find each other and leave the crowded party to talk alone, and they discuss their imperfect family lives. Frankie feels like her black identity is being erased by her adoptive white family. Phoenix's dad left when he was young and never calls, and Phoenix has to help his mom take care of his sister with a medical condition. Meanwhile, Jo couldn't attend the party because their mom forced them to go to a church function. Jo is scolded by her mom and church for being gay and not dressing femininely enough (\"That I Would Be Good\"). Phoenix asks Frankie if she has a boyfriend, and she says that she doesn't. The next morning at school, Jo and Frankie discuss how both of their nights were not fun and didn't go as planned. Jo brings up Phoenix and his crush on Frankie, but Frankie brushes it off and doesn't mention her talk with him at the party. Jo shows Frankie pictures that are circulating throughout the school of Bella, Nick's friend, who was drunk, passed out, and had her shirt pulled up at the party. Students are making fun of Bella and calling her a slut. Frankie and Jo go to Bella's house, despite barely knowing her, to check on her. Bella reveals that Andrew, Nick's best friend, was the one who took the pictures and raped her, but no one believes her. Frankie and Jo tell Bella they believe her. Frankie goes home and wakes Nick up to reprimand him about going to the police since he was the only witness of Bella at the party. Nick brushes off Bella's claim, saying that she was drunk and being dramatic per usual. MJ overhears the conversation and insists that Nick can't come forward as it might ruin his reputation. MJ blames Bella for what happened, saying that this situation is super common, but she is visibly upset by the story and leaves the house to get some air (\"Wake Up\"). MJ walks to the church for the first time in a while to pray about her failing marriage, struggling relationship with Frankie, and for help with her addiction. She then reflects on her own memory of being raped in college, but blames herself and feels it was God's plan for her (\"Forgiven\").\n\n'''Act II'''\n\nSteve finally convinces MJ to go to their first marriage counseling session, despite her reluctance (\"Not the Doctor\"). Steve reveals that he and MJ have not had sex for over a year. MJ says that they don't need sex since Steve is constantly watching porn. The therapist wonders if MJ's car accident may have triggered memories of past sexual trauma, but MJ insists she does not have any sexual trauma. Steve states that he appreciates MJ for all she does for him and the family, and he tells her that he misses her and the way they used to be. Meanwhile, Frankie and Phoenix sing to each other and end up sleeping together (\"Head over Feet\"). Jo walks into the Healy's house uninvited (\"Your House\") and walks in on Frankie and Phoenix. Jo gets mad and storms out of the house. On her way out, she runs into MJ and Steve fighting while coming home from therapy. Jo tells them that Frankie just had sex with Phoenix. Phoenix leaves quickly, leaving Frankie alone with her parents. MJ and Steve reprimand her for having sex so young. Frankie comes out to her parents as bisexual, and she gets mad at her parents for being disapproving of her consensual sex while they don't care about Bella's rape. Frankie says that she's not actually their daughter since she was adopted and blames her parents for only seeing her as who they want her to be, not who she really is. Frankie decides to run away to New York City. Steve and MJ get into another fight about Steve not being present during Frankie's childhood. Frankie takes a train alone to New York (\"Unprodigal Daughter\"). When she gets lost in the city, Frankie calls Phoenix. She tells him that she loves him and that he should come pick her up. When Phoenix doesn't say 'I love you' back and that he needs to stay at home to help his sister with her malfunctioning feeding tube, Frankie gets angry and feels that Phoenix only wants her for her body.\n\nStudents are gossiping about Bella and her accusations against Andrew. Bella comes to the Healy's house to talk to Nick, but the only person home is MJ. MJ tells Bella she was also raped in college. After Bella leaves, Nick tells MJ the entirety of what happened that night. He was in the room when Bella was unconscious and raped, but he did nothing (\"Predator\"). Nick tells his mom that he wants to go to the police, but MJ says that it would only ruin his life and not help Bella's. MJ is devastated and furious, but Nick accuses her of only caring about herself and her reputation, and not about Bella. MJ hits him. Jo comes to New York to pick up Frankie after Frankie desperately calls her, lost and out of money. She shows little remorse about sleeping with Phoenix since she didn't think her relationship with Jo was exclusive. She tells Jo that she fell in love with Phoenix. Jo says that Frankie would have told her about Phoenix if she didn't know it was wrong. Jo ends the relationship (\"You Oughta Know\"). Frankie gets a call that something is wrong with MJ. At home, MJ overdoses on her pills, and Steve and Nick find her unconscious (\"Uninvited\"). When Steve gets to the hospital, he is devastated that he didn't know how MJ had an addiction and comforts her (\"Mary Jane\"). They both agree to start to truly try to work on their marriage. When Nick gets to the hospital, MJ tells him that he should go to the police because justice for Bella is more important than her reputation, but Nick already went to the police. Meanwhile, many students attend the rally that Frankie organized for Bella. Bella is mad at Nick since people only believed her once Nick came forward, and her statement wasn't enough (\"No\").\n\nA year has passed, and MJ is writing the yearly Healy Christmas letter. She writes about Frankie's passion for social justice and her dedication to helping Bella. MJ opens up about having been a victim of sexual assault as well. Bella is finally going to tell her side of the story in court. MJ and Frankie reconcile after MJ overcomes her addiction. MJ tells Frankie that she wanted her to feel like every other kid and not be treated differently because of her race, but Frankie tells her that she will always be different (\"Thank U\"). Nick is taking a year off before college to find himself. MJ discusses that she and Steve are in therapy, both individually and together. She opens up about her overdose and treatment for her addiction to painkillers, but she has learned to see how kind the people in her life truly are. Frankie dares MJ to email the Christmas letter to everyone, and MJ sends it. She decides that this will be her last Christmas letter.

MacKenzie, one of the most important late 19th-century secondary school educators, proposed using the endowment to create a separate upper-level boarding school for boys.  Two hundred acres on the bluff above the town of stone [[granite]] buildings and the broad picturesque [[Susquehanna River]] were purchased for this purpose.  MacKenzie in turn consulted with [[Robert Swain Peabody]] (1845-1917), of the prominent [[Boston]] architectural firm of [[Peabody & Stearns]], concerning the design of the new Jacob Tome Institute.<ref name=HAER/>\n\nFollowing a design competition in 1900, supervised by Peabody, the Board of Trustees selected designs by partner architects [[William Boring]] (1859-1937), and [[Edward Lippincott Tilton]] (1861-1933), co-designers of the U.S. immigration station at [[Ellis Island]] in [[New York harbor]] and other significant structures, in the then popular [[Beaux-Arts architecture|beaux arts]] architectural style.<ref name=HAER/> Over the next five years, stone buildings were built on the bluffs above Port Deposit using its famous local Port Deposit granite overlooking the [[Susquehanna River]].

It was part of a system of schools collectively known as the Jacob Tome Institute that began with [[kindergarten]] and extended through [[high school]].<ref name=\"Walsh\">{{cite book|author=Richard Walsh and William Lloyd Fox (editors)  |title=Maryland: A History 1632-1974 |publisher= Maryland Historical Society, Baltimore |year=1983|id=ISBN }}</ref> Situated in the northeast corner of the state, the Tome School was immediately popular, attracting almost all the students from the town of Port Deposit and many from outside, throughout [[Maryland]], [[Pennsylvania]] and neighboring states.<ref name=HAER>{{cite web|last1=Massey Maxwell Associates|title=Jacob Tome Institute, Memorial Hall, Tome Road, Port Deposit, Cecil County, MD|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/item/md1528/|website=www.loc.gov|publisher=Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record/Historic American Landscapes Survey|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Director's Residence Jacob Tome Institute Cecil Maryland.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Original Director's residence of the Jacob Tome Institute]] Tome left the school an endowment at his death in 1898.<ref name=\"Susq\"/> Under the direction of his widow, Evalyn N. Tome, the Board of Trustees hired [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrant [[James Cameron Mackenzie]] (1852-1931), to direct the school.  MacKenzie, one of the most important late 19th-century secondary school educators, proposed using the endowment to create a separate upper-level boarding school for boys.  Two hundred acres on the bluff above the town of stone [[granite]] buildings and the broad picturesque [[Susquehanna River]] were purchased for this purpose.  MacKenzie in turn consulted with [[Robert Swain Peabody]] (1845-1917), of the prominent [[Boston]] architectural firm of [[Peabody & Stearns]], concerning the design of the new Jacob Tome Institute.<ref name=HAER/>\n\nFollowing a design competition in 1900, supervised by Peabody, the Board of Trustees selected designs by partner architects [[William Boring]] (1859-1937), and [[Edward Lippincott Tilton]] (1861-1933), co-designers of the U.S. immigration station at [[Ellis Island]] in [[New York harbor]] and other significant structures, in the then popular [[Beaux-Arts architecture|beaux arts]] architectural style.<ref name=HAER/> Over the next five years, stone buildings were built on the bluffs above Port Deposit using its famous local Port Deposit granite overlooking the [[Susquehanna River]].

This produces the effect of being able to hear even when the source is blocked by a solid object.  The [[sound wave]]s bend appreciably around the solid object.\n\nHowever, if the object has a diameter greater than the [[acoustics|acoustic]] wavelength, a 'sound shadow' is cast behind the object where the sound is inaudible. (Note: some sound may be propagated through the object depending on material).\n\n==Optical atmospheric diffraction==\n{{see also|Atmospheric optics}}\n[[File:SolarDiffractionCorona.jpg|thumbnail|left|Solar diffraction ring]]\n\nWhen [[light]] travels through thin [[clouds]] made up of nearly uniform sized [[water]] or [[aerosol]] droplets or [[ice]] [[crystal]]s, [[diffraction]] or bending of light occurs as the light is diffracted by the edges of the particles.  This degree of bending of light depends on the frequency (color) of light and the size of the particles.  The result is a pattern of rings, which seem to emanate from the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], a [[planet]], or another [[astronomical object]]. The most distinct part of this pattern is a central, nearly white disk. This resembles an [[atmospheric]] [[Airy disc]] but is not actually an Airy disk. It is distinct from [[rainbow]]s and [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halos]], which are mainly caused by [[refraction]].\n\n[[File:Lunarcorona.jpg|right|thumbnail|Lunar diffraction ring]]\n\nThe left photo shows a diffraction ring around the rising Sun caused by a veil of aerosol. This effect dramatically disappeared when the Sun rose high enough until the pattern was no longer visible on the Earth's surface. This phenomenon is sometimes called the [[corona (optical phenomenon)|corona effect]], not to be confused with the [[solar corona]].\n\nOn the right is a [[shutter speed|1/10-second]] [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] showing an overexposed [[full moon]]. The Moon is seen through thin vaporous clouds, which glow with a bright disk surrounded by an illuminated red ring. A longer exposure would show more faint colors beyond the outside red ring.\n\nAnother form of atmospheric [[diffraction]] or bending of light occurs when light moves through fine layers of [[particulate]] dust trapped primarily in the middle layers of the [[troposphere]]. This effect differs from water based atmospheric diffraction because the dust material is [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] whereas water allows light to pass through it. This has the effect of [[tint]]ing the light the color of the dust particles. This tinting can vary from red to yellow depending on geographical location. the other primary difference is that dust based diffraction acts as a [[Magnification|magnifier]] instead of creating a distinct [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]]. This occurs because the opaque matter does not share the lensing properties of water. The effect is to make an object visibly larger while being more indistinct as the dust distorts the image. This effect varies largely based on the amount and type of dust in the atmosphere.\n\n==Radio wave propagation in the ionosphere==\n{{see also|Ionospheric radio propagation}}\nThe [[ionosphere]] is a layer of partially [[ionized]] [[gases]] high above the majority of the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]]; these gases are ionized by [[cosmic rays]] originating on the sun.  When radio waves travel into this zone, which commences about 80 kilometers above the earth, they experience [[diffraction]] in a manner similar to the [[visible light]] phenomenon described above.<ref>[[Leonid M. Brekhovskikh]], ''Waves in Layered Media'' [[Academic Press]], New York, 1960)</ref> In this case some of the electromagnetic energy is bent in a large arc, such that it can return to the Earth's surface at a very distant point (on the order of hundreds of kilometers from the [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] source.  More remarkably some of this radio wave energy bounces off the Earth's surface and reaches the ionosphere for a second time, at a distance even farther away than the first time.  Consequently, a high powered [[transmitter]] can effectively broadcast over 1000 kilometers by using multiple \"skips\" off of the ionosphere.  And, at times of favorable atmospheric conditions good \"skip\" occurs, then even a low power transmitter can be heard halfway around th world.  This often occurs for \"novice\" radio amateurs \"hams\" who are limited by law to transmitters with no more than 65 watts.  The Kon-Tiki expedition communicated regularly with a 6 watt transmitter from the middle of the Pacific. For more details see the \"communications\" part of the \"[[Kon-Tiki expedition]]\" entry in Wikipedia.\n\nAn exotic variant of this radio wave propagation has been examined to show that, theoretically, the ionospheric bounce could be greatly exaggerated if a high powered spherical [[Acoustics|acoustical]] wave were created in the ionosphere from a source on earth.<ref>Michael Hogan, ''Ionospheric Diffraction of VHF Radio Waves'', ESL Inc., Palo Alto, California, IR-26 22 May 1967</ref>\n\n==Acoustical diffraction near the Earth's surface==\n\nIn the case of [[sound waves]] travelling near the Earth's surface, the waves are diffracted or bent as they traverse by a geometric edge, such as a wall or building.  This phenomenon leads to a very important practical effect:  that we can hear \"around corners\".  Because of the frequencies involved considerable amount of the sound energy (on the order of ten percent) actually travels into this would be sound \"shadow zone\".  Visible light exhibits a similar effect, but, due to its much shorter [[wavelength]], only a minute amount of light energy travels around a corner.\n\nA useful branch of acoustics dealing with the design of [[noise barrier]]s examines this acoustical diffraction phenomenon in quantitative detail to calculate the optimum height and placement of a soundwall or berm adjacent to a highway.\n\nThis phenomenon is also inherent in calculating the sound levels from [[aircraft noise]], so that an accurate determination of topographic features may be understood.
