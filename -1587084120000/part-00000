In 1980, MGM joined forces with [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS Video Enterprises]], the home video division of the [[CBS]] television network, and established '''MGM/CBS Home Video'''. In October of that year, they released their first batch of Betamax and VHS tapes: ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''[[That's Entertainment!]]'', ''[[Network (film)|Network]]'', ''[[Coma (1978 film)|Coma]]'', ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'', ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1975 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'', ''[[Blowup]]'', ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'', ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'', ''[[Adam's Rib]]'', ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'', ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', ''[[The Boys in the Band]]'', ''[[Rude Boy (film)|Rude Boy]]'', ''[[Rio Lobo]]'', ''[[The Street Fighter]]'', ''[[Electric Light Orchestra]] in Concert'', ''[[James Taylor]] In Concert'', ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', and ''[[Giselle]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT58&lpg=PT58&dq=%22MGM+CBS%22+Billboard&source=bl&ots=_yRY29MTdL&sig=3j5u0LdCHS-AAC77tJ0FQld_Rk0&hl=en&ei=hTSrTZf0LYnW0QG90pX5CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CCoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false Billboard Magazine, 22 Nov 1980]</ref><!--This is for informational purposes only.-->\n\nThe initial printings of all 24 films were packaged in brown leather clamshell cases with gold lettering; they were presented to CBS executives. Later printings of these films, as well as all printings of later releases by MGM/CBS, were packaged in oversized gray book-style boxes with either the MGM Abstract Lion print logo or CBS Video print logo in the upper right hand corner of the packaging. MGM/CBS also issued some early tapes of [[Lorimar]] product; those releases would instead bear the Lorimar print logo where the MGM or CBS Video print logo would normally be.\n\nIn 1982, a year after MGM bought and merged with the near-bankrupt [[United Artists]], CBS dropped out of the video partnership with MGM and moved to [[20th Century Fox]] to create [[CBS/Fox Video]]. MGM's video division became known as '''MGM/UA Home Entertainment Group, Inc.''', more commonly known as '''MGM/UA Home Video'''. MGM/UA continued to license pre-1981 UA and [[Associated Artists Productions|pre-1950]] [[Warner Bros.|WB]] films (as well as some post-1981 titles) to CBS/Fox (due to an agreement UA had with Fox years earlier dating back to when CBS/Fox Home Video was called [[Magnetic Video]]).\n\nIn 1986, MGM's pre-May 1986 library (also including the pre-1950 [[Warner Bros.]] library, ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]]'', the [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Famous Studios]] ''[[Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)|Popeye]]'' cartoons, most US rights to the [[RKO Pictures]] library, and ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' and its animated spin-offs) was acquired by [[Ted Turner]] and his company [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Entertainment Co.]]. After the library was acquired, MGM/UA signed a deal with Turner to continue distributing the pre-May 1986 MGM and to begin distributing the pre-1950 Warner Bros. libraries for video release (the rest of the library went to '''Turner Home Entertainment''').\n\nIn October 1990, after [[Path\u00e9]] bought MGM, MGM/UA Home Video struck a deal with [[Warner Home Video]] to have them distribute MGM/UA titles exclusively on home video.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716231858/http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/robertharris/harris102504.html Robert Harris interview with George Feltenstein] ''TheDigitalBits.com'' (October 28, 2004)</ref> MGM/UA began distributing the UA library after its contract with CBS/Fox ended. In 1995, MGM/UA Home Video founded the kids and family label '''MGM/UA Family Entertainment'''. In 1996, Warner made an exclusive deal with [[Image Entertainment]] to distribute MGM/UA titles on [[LaserDisc]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/IMAGE+ENTERTAINMENT+ACQUIRES+EXCLUSIVE+RIGHTS+TO+PACKAGE+OF+MGM%252FUA...-a017981437|title=IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT ACQUIRES EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO PACKAGE OF MGM/UA TITLES FOR LASERDISC - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-09-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, MGM/UA began releasing its titles on [[DVD]], just like every other major studio. Some of the films MGM released on DVD were from the Turner catalog, which they were still allowed to keep after Turner merged into [[Time Warner]] some time before because of their distribution deal. That same year, MGM acquired [[Orion Pictures]]. As a result, '''Orion Home Video''' (Orion's home video division) was bought out by MGM/UA, and was retained as an in-name-only division until the acquisition deal was finalized in 1998. In 1998, the company was renamed '''MGM Home Entertainment''' and MGM/UA Family Entertainment was renamed '''MGM Family Entertainment'''.\n\nIn March 1999, MGM paid Warner Bros. $225 million to end their distribution agreement in February 2000; the initial deal was to have expired in 2003. As a result of the deal, MGM gave up the home video rights to the MGM/UA films owned by Turner to [[Warner Home Video]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MGM+REGAINS+VIDEO+RIGHTS%253B+$225+MILLION+DEAL+TO+HELP+SELL+DVDS.-a083605917|title=MGM REGAINS VIDEO RIGHTS; $225 MILLION DEAL TO HELP SELL DVDS. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-09-09}}</ref> Upon the expiration of the Warner deal, MGM sold overseas video rights to [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MGM+and+Fox+Form+International+Distribution+and+Strategic+Alliance.-a054937422|title=MGM and Fox Form International Distribution and Strategic Alliance. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-09-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, MGM and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].com launched the \"MGM Movie Vault\" to distribute VHS copies of selected films, either previously unreleased on video or long out-of-print, exclusively through Amazon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Amazon.com+and+MGM+Home+Entertainment+Partner+to+Raise+the+Curtain+On...-a070701621|title=Amazon.com and MGM Home Entertainment Partner to Raise the Curtain On MGM's Legendary Film Vault. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-10-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, MGM Family Entertainment was renamed '''MGM Kids'''.\n\nIn 2005, following MGM's acquisition by the [[Sony]]-led consortium, the company was under the [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] label but not using the MGM Home Entertainment name on any releases, which has distributed the MGM library, though under the MGM label. The deal ended a year later.\n\nIn 2006, after MGM ended their distribution agreement with Sony, they announced that they would be signing a new distribution deal with [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]. Originally, DVD releases of MGM/UA and [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] [[TriStar Pictures|TriStar]] co-releases continued to be distributed by SPHE, since Sony then still owned 20% of MGM, whereas Fox has no controlling interest; however, Fox has since released DVD editions of films based on MGM IPs. On April 14, 2011, Fox's deal distributing the MGM library is extended until the end of 2016.<ref name=\"Deadline 2011-4-14\">[http://www.deadline.com/2011/04/mgm-re-ups-dvd-deal-with-fox-through-2016/ MGM Re-Ups DVD Deal With Fox Through 2016] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111225622/http://www.deadline.com/2011/04/mgm-re-ups-dvd-deal-with-fox-through-2016/ |date=2014-01-11 }}, deadline.com</ref> On June 27, 2016, Fox's deal distributing the MGM library is extended again until June 2020.<ref name=\"Deadline 2016-6-27\">[http://deadline.com/2016/06/mgm-fox-home-entertainment-deal-james-bond-rocky-1201780139/ MGM & 20th Century Fox Renew Home Entertainment Deal], deadline.com</ref>\n\nIn 2008, MGM Kids was discontinued and was folded into MGM Home Entertainment, but on October 5, 2010, MGM Kids was revived.\n\nIn 2010, parent company [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] had emerged from bankruptcy. As of 2011, MGM no longer releases or markets its own movies.  Instead, MGM now resorts to co-distributing with other studios that handle all distribution and marketing for MGM's projects.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fritz|first=Ben|title=MGM film studio remade with a low-profile and a focused strategy|date=13 December 2011|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/13/business/la-fi-ct-mgm-20111213|accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref> Since then, only some of the MGM's most recent movies, such as ''[[Skyfall]]'', ''[[Red Dawn (2012 film)|Red Dawn]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=White|first=Michael|title=MGM Studio Says Earnings Soar on Films \u2018Skyfall,\u2019 \u2018Hobbit\u2019|date=16 May 2013|publisher=''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-16/mgm-studio-says-earnings-soar-on-film-hits-skyfall-hobbit-|accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref> ''[[Carrie (2013 film)|Carrie]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dickson|first=Evan|title=The \u2018Carrie\u2019 Blu-ray Will Have A New Ending (Hopefully Better Than The Theatrical One)|date=3 December 2013|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3267285/the-carrie-blu-ray-will-have-a-new-ending-hopefully-better-than-the-theatrical-one/|accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref> ''[[RoboCop (2014 film)|RoboCop]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios (MGM) and Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment present ROBOCOP, arriving on Digital HD May 20 and on Blu-ray, DVD and VOD June 3|date=1 May 2014|url=http://don411.com/metro-goldwyn-mayer-studios-mgm-and-twentieth-century-fox-home-entertainment-present-robocop-arriving-on-digital-hd-may-20-and-on-blu-ray-dvd-and-vod-june-3/#.VNQYP9LF-GM|accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref> ''[[If I Stay (film)|If I Stay]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Palmer|first=Jason|title=Win If I Stay on DVD|date=2 February 2015|url=http://www.entertainment-focus.com/competitions/win-stay-dvd/|accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref> ''[[Poltergeist (2015 film)|Poltergeist]]'' and ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' have all been released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] by its home video output and [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]].

In October of that year, they released their first batch of Betamax and VHS tapes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT58&lpg=PT58&dq=%22MGM+CBS%22+Billboard&source=bl&ots=_yRY29MTdL&sig=3j5u0LdCHS-AAC77tJ0FQld_Rk0&hl=en&ei=hTSrTZf0LYnW0QG90pX5CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CCoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Billboard|first=Nielsen Business Media|last=Inc|date=22 November 1980|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|via=Google Books}}</ref><!--This is for informational purposes only.-->\n\nThe initial printings of all 24 films were packaged in brown leather clamshell cases with gold lettering; they were presented to CBS executives. Later printings of these films, as well as all printings of later releases by MGM/CBS, were packaged in oversized gray book-style boxes with either the MGM Abstract Lion print logo or CBS Video print logo in the upper right hand corner of the packaging. MGM/CBS also issued some early tapes of [[Lorimar]] product; those releases would instead bear the Lorimar print logo where the MGM or CBS Video print logo would normally be.\n\n===MGM/UA era, distribution deal with Turner Entertainment (1982-1998)===\nIn 1982, a year after MGM bought and merged with the near-bankrupt [[United Artists]] from [[Transamerica Corporation|Transamerica]], CBS dropped out of the video partnership with MGM and moved to [[20th Century Fox]] to create [[CBS/Fox Video]]. MGM's video division became known as '''MGM/UA Home Entertainment Group, Inc.''', more commonly known as '''MGM/UA Home Video'''. MGM/UA continued to license pre-1981 UA and [[Associated Artists Productions|pre-1950]] [[Warner Bros.|WB]] films (as well as some post-1981 titles) to CBS/Fox (due to an agreement UA had with Fox years earlier dating back to when CBS/Fox Home Video was called [[Magnetic Video]]).\n\nIn 1986, MGM's pre-May 1986 library (also including the pre-1950 [[Warner Bros.]] library, ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]]'', the [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Famous Studios]] ''[[Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)|Popeye]]'' cartoons, and most US rights to the [[RKO Pictures]] library), was acquired by [[Ted Turner]] and his company [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Entertainment Co.]]. After the library was acquired, MGM/UA signed a deal with Turner to continue distributing the pre-May 1986 MGM and to begin distributing the pre-1950 Warner Bros. libraries for video release (the rest of the library went to '''Turner Home Entertainment''').\n\nIn October 1990, after [[Path\u00e9]] bought MGM, MGM/UA Home Video struck a deal with [[Warner Home Video]] to have them distribute MGM/UA titles exclusively on home video.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716231858/http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/robertharris/harris102504.html Robert Harris interview with George Feltenstein] ''TheDigitalBits.com'' (October 28, 2004)</ref> MGM/UA began distributing the UA library after its contract with CBS/Fox ended. In 1995, MGM/UA Home Video launched the '''MGM/UA Family Entertainment''' label for family-friendly releases. In 1996, Warner made an exclusive deal with [[Image Entertainment]] to distribute MGM/UA titles on [[LaserDisc]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/IMAGE+ENTERTAINMENT+ACQUIRES+EXCLUSIVE+RIGHTS+TO+PACKAGE+OF+MGM%252FUA...-a017981437|title=IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT ACQUIRES EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO PACKAGE OF MGM/UA TITLES FOR LASERDISC - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-09-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, MGM/UA, along with the other studios that were distributed by Warner Home Video, began releasing its titles on [[DVD]]. Some of the films MGM released on DVD were from the Turner catalog, which they were still allowed to keep after Turner merged into [[Time Warner]] some time before because of their distribution deal. That same year, MGM acquired [[Orion Pictures]]. As a result, '''Orion Home Video''' (Orion's home video division) was bought out by MGM/UA, and was retained as an in-name-only division until the acquisition deal was finalized in 1998. In 1998, the company was renamed '''MGM Home Entertainment''' and MGM/UA Family Entertainment was renamed '''MGM Family Entertainment'''.\n\n===MGM Home Entertainment (1998-2005)===\nIn March 1999, MGM paid Warner Bros. $225 million to end their distribution agreement in February 2000; the initial deal was to have expired in 2003.

Originally, DVD releases of MGM/UA and [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] [[TriStar Pictures|TriStar]] co-releases continued to be distributed by SPHE, since Sony then still owned 20% of MGM, whereas Fox has no controlling interest; however, Fox has since released DVD editions of films based on MGM IPs.

People may choose fields, bushes, forests, ditches, streets, canals or other open space for defecation. They do so because either they do not have a toilet readily accessible or due to traditional cultural practices.<ref name=\"ClasenBoisson2014\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Clasen T, Boisson S, Routray P, Torondel B, Bell M, Cumming O, Ensink J, Freeman M, Jenkins M, Odagiri M, Ray S, Sinha A, Suar M, Schmidt WP | display-authors = 6 | title = Effectiveness of a rural sanitation programme on diarrhoea, soil-transmitted helminth infection, and child malnutrition in Odisha, India: a cluster-randomised trial | journal = The Lancet.

Even if toilets are available, [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] efforts may still be needed to promote the use of toilets.\n\n'''Open defecation free''' (ODF) is used to describe communities that have shifted to using a toilet instead of open defecation. This can happen for example after [[community-led total sanitation]] programs have been implemented.\n\nThe current estimate is that around 673 million people practice open defecation, with over 75% (520 million) of this being from India.<ref name=\"JMP2019\">WHO and UNICEF (2019) [https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/jmp-report-2019/en/ Progress on household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene 2000\u20132017: Special focus on inequalities], Geneva, Switzerland</ref>{{rp|74}} This is down from about 892 million people, or 12 percent of the global population, who practiced open defecation in 2016.<ref name=\"JMP2017\" /> In that year, seventy-six percent (678 million) of the 892 million people practicing open defecation in the world live in just seven countries.<ref name=\"JMP2017\" />\n\nOpen defecation can pollute the environment and cause health problems.

In ancient times, there were more open spaces and less population pressure on land.

With development and urbanization, open defecating started becoming a challenge and thereby an important [[public health]] issue, and an issue of human [[dignity]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=O'Reilly |first=Kathleen | name-list-format = vanc |date=1 January 2016|title=From toilet insecurity to toilet security: creating safe sanitation for women and girls|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Water|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=19\u201324|doi=10.1002/wat2.1122|issn=2049-1948}}</ref> With the increase in population in smaller areas, such as cities and towns, more attention was given to hygiene and health.

This was due to the publications by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) and the UN [[International Year of Sanitation]]. The JMP is a joint program by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]].\n\nFor monitoring purposes, two categories were created: 1) [[improved sanitation]] and (2) [[unimproved sanitation]]. Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.\n\nIn 2013 [[World Toilet Day]] was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/DSG%20sanitation%20two-pager%20FINAL.pdf|title=United Nations Deputy Secretary-General's Call to Action on Sanitation|date=2013|website=United Nations|access-date=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Open defecation free ===\n\n\"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in [[community-led total sanitation]] (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation.

This was due to the publications by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) and the UN [[International Year of Sanitation]]. The JMP is a joint program by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]].\n\nFor monitoring purposes, two categories were created: 1) [[improved sanitation]] and (2) [[unimproved sanitation]]. Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.\n\nIn 2013 [[World Toilet Day]] was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/DSG%20sanitation%20two-pager%20FINAL.pdf|title=United Nations Deputy Secretary-General's Call to Action on Sanitation|date=2013|website=United Nations|access-date=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Open defecation free ===\n\n\"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in [[community-led total sanitation]] (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation.
