Commissioned corps officers typically receive their commissions through the commissioned corps's [[Direct commission officer|direct commissioning program]].\n\nAs with its parent division, the Public Health Service, the commissioned corps is under the direction of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]. The commissioned corps is led by the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], who holds the grade of [[Vice admiral (United States)|vice admiral]].<ref name=Uniforms>{{cite web |url=http://www.usphs.gov/AboutUs/uniforms.aspx |title=U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=24 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513175033/http://www.usphs.gov/AboutUs/uniforms.aspx |archive-date=13 May 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Surgeon General reports directly to the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Assistant Secretary for Health]]; the Assistant Secretary of Health may be appointed to the rank of [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] if he or she is also a serving uniformed officer of the commissioned corps.<ref name=Uniforms/>\n\n==History==\nThe Public Health Service Commissioned Corps had its beginnings with the creation of the Marine Hospital Fund in 1798, which later was reorganized in 1871 as the [[Marine Hospital Service]]. The Marine Hospital Service was charged with the care and maintenance of merchant sailors, but as the country grew, so did the ever-expanding mission of the service. The Marine Hospital Service soon began taking on new expanding health roles that included such health initiatives that protected the commerce and health of America. One such role was [[quarantine]].\n\n[[John Maynard Woodworth]], a famous surgeon of the Union Army who served under General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], was appointed in 1871 as the Supervising Surgeon. Woodworth's title was later changed to \"Supervising Surgeon General,\" which later became the [[Surgeon General of the United States]]. Woodworth is credited with the formal creation of the Commissioned Corps. Woodworth organized the Marine Hospital Service medical personnel along Army military structure in 1889 to facilitate a mobile force of health professionals that could be moved for the needs of the service and country. He established appointment standards and designed the Marine Hospital Service herald of a [[Foul (nautical)#Fouled anchor|fouled anchor]] and [[Caduceus as a symbol of medicine|caduceus]]. Later that year of 1889, President Grover Cleveland signed an Act into law that formally established the modern Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (then the [[Marine Hospital Service]] under the Supervising Surgeon (later Surgeon General)). At first open only to [[physician]]s, over the course of the twentieth century, the Corps expanded to 11 careers in a wide range of specialties to include veterinarians, [[dentist]]s, engineers, [[pharmacist]]s, [[nurse]]s, environmental health specialists, [[scientist]]s, dietitians, and other [[allied health professional]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://usphs.gov/profession/|title=USPHS: Career & Benefits|website=usphs.gov|access-date=2016-11-06}}</ref>\n\nToday, the commissioned corps is under the [[United States Public Health Service]] (PHS), a major agency now of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), established by Congress in 1979-1980. It was previously established in 1953 as the [[United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare|U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] (HEW), and is still led by the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]]. The commissioned corps allocates officers to all seven uniformed services depending on the health or medical needs of the other uniformed services. The commissioned corps was featured in the 1950 motion picture [[Panic in the Streets (film)|''Panic in the Streets'']], in which [[Richard Widmark]] portrayed a Public Health Service physician tracking down a victim of [[pneumonic plague]], an infectious disease that is one of three forms of [[plague]], the other two being [[septicemic plague]] and [[bubonic plague]].\n\n==Purpose==\nThe stated mission of the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service is \"Protecting, promoting, and advancing the health and safety of the Nation\" in accordance with the commissioned corps's four Core Values: Leadership, Excellence, Integrity, and Service. Officers execute the mission of the commissioned corps in the following ways:\n*Help provide healthcare and related services to medically underserved populations: to [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]], [[Alaska Natives]], and to other population groups with special needs;\n*Prevent and control disease, identify health hazards in the environment and help correct them, and promote healthy lifestyles for the nation's citizens;\n*Improve the nation's mental health; \n*Ensure that drugs and medical devices are safe and effective, food is safe and wholesome, cosmetics are harmless, and that electronic products do not expose users to dangerous amounts of radiation;\n*Conduct and support biomedical, behavioral, and health services research, and communicate research results to health professionals and the public; and\n*Work with other nations and international agencies on global health problems and their solutions.\n\nPlus, the commissioned corps provides officers (Medical Officers, Dental Officers, Therapists, Environmental Health Officers, etc.) to other uniformed services, primarily the [[United States Coast Guard]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps]] (NOAA Corps). Commissioned corps officers may be detailed to other federal agencies including the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[TRICARE]], [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] ([[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]), [[United States Department of State|State Department]], [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], and the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] ([[National Park Service]]). Commissioned corps officers may develop individual memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with other organizations, including state and local health agencies, and even non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\n\nThe Commissioned Corps is often called upon by other federal, state, and local agencies to aid and augment in times when those agencies' resources are overwhelmed. These responses are designated as deployments by the commissioned corps, if the deployment is outside of the officer's \"normal\" duties, and coordinated through the commissioned corps's Readiness and Deployment Operations Group (REDDOG) in the Division of Commissioned Corps Personnel and Readiness (DCCPR).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usphs.gov/newsroom/features/recent/deployments.aspx|title=Commisisoned Corps Deployments: Public Health Emergency Responders|last=|first=|date=September 19, 2014|website=Usphs.gov|access-date=2016-11-06}}</ref> Deployments may be for technical needs in standard settings, or in the event of disasters, in austere environments.\n\n==Deployments==\nThe commissioned corps is often deployed as part of the [[National Response Framework]] Emergency Support Function #8 \u2013 Public Health and Medical Services, but can be deployed outside of the Framework for various needs to other federal agencies, states, local governments, or even to aid foreign governments. Like all other federal-level responses, commissioned corps officers are deployed only upon request, and upon the recommendation of the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] and permission of the [[Assistant Secretary for Health]]. During deployments, commissioned corps officers may report to regular office spaces, such as coordinating responses at state-of-the-art emergency operations centers, or into the field in extremely austere environments, such as when responding to a natural disaster. In addition, deployments may either be on an individual basis, such as when specific skill sets are needed, or as part of a team, when large-scale responses are needed.\n\nThe commissioned corps uses a tiered system of response, with Tier 1 response teams ready and able to respond to an event within 12 hours, and Tier 2 teams ready and able to respond within 36 hours. Officers not on Tier 1 or 2 teams are Tier 3 responders, ready and able to respond to an event in 72 hours. Tier 1 teams are primarily made up of Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) teams that are made up of over 100 officers with multiple specialties, and are focused on providing acute clinical care of disaster-exacerbated chronic conditions. Officers who do not work as a clinical care provider on one of these teams are often in support roles, such as logistics, administration/finance, or planning. Tier 2 teams are composed of a smaller, more specialized workforce. Current Tier 2 teams include the Applied Public Health Team (APHT), the Mental Health Team (MHT), and the Services Access Team (SAT). Tier 3 commissioned corps officers not already assigned to one of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 teams are used to augment the Tier 1 and Tier 2 teams in the event of staffing shortages due to availability, or the need to scale up a response.\n\nThey are trained and equipped to respond to public health crises and national emergencies, such as natural disasters, disease outbreaks, or terrorist attacks. The teams are multidisciplinary and are capable of responding to domestic and international humanitarian missions.

PHS Corps officers have been part of the Navy's [[Pacific Partnership]] (in the Pacific basin) and [[Operation Continuing Promise|Continuing Promise]] (in the Caribbean/west Atlantic) since 2007. Such missions are often carried out on either the US Navy's commissioned hospital ships, the {{USNS|Mercy|T-AH-19}} or {{USNS|Comfort|T-AH-20}}, though other ships, such as the amphibious assault ship {{USS|Bataan|LHD-5}}, have also been used. The command staff of the PHS deployed team(s) is deployed for the entire mission duration (often three months), while operational personnel serve one month aboard, meeting and departing the ships at the ports of call during the mission.\n\nThe commissioned corps, as a uniformed service, may be militarized and considered a branch of the armed forces by an act of Congress, or by executive order by the President of the United States, not only in time of war, but in \"an emergency involving the national defense proclaimed by the President.\" Major militarization of the corps occurred during [[World War II]] and another later during the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dcp.psc.gov/ccbulletin/PDF_docs/Oct01ccb.pdf|title=DCP.PSC.gov|website=Dcp.psc.gov|accessdate=2 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110005939/http://dcp.psc.gov/ccbulletin/PDF_docs/Oct01ccb.pdf|archive-date=10 November 2005|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Uniforms and insignia==\n{{Multiple image\n|footer    = '''USPHS Commissioned Corps uniforms'''\n|width1    = 125\n|image1    = service dress blues.jpg\n|alt1      = Service Dress Blues\n|caption1  = Service dress blues\n|width2    = 125\n|image2    = summer whites.jpg|130px\n|alt2      = Summer Whites\n|caption2  = Summer whites\n|width3    = 125\n|image3    = Summer khakis.jpg\n|alt3      = Service Khakis\n|caption3  = Service khakis\n|width4    = 263\n|image4    = US Public Health Service Operation United Assistance 2014.jpg\n|alt4      = USCG, NOAA Corps, and USPHS Operational Dress Uniform\n|caption4  = [[Operational Dress Uniform|Operational dress uniform]]\n}}\n{{Multiple image\n|width1    = 126\n|image1    = CAP DEVICE UNMOUNTED PHS.PNG\n|caption1  = PHSCC combination cap device\n|width2    = 122\n|image2    = PHSCC Collar Device.png\n|caption2  = PHSCC cap, collar, and sleeve device\n|width3    = 124\n|image3    = PHSCC Lapel Pin.png\n|caption3  = PHSCC lapel pin ''(for civilian dress)''\n|footer    = '''USPHS Commissioned Corps insignia'''\n}}\nCommissioned Corps officers wear uniforms similar to those of the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Coast Guard]] with special Public Health Service insignia. Their service dress blues, summer whites, and their service khakis have been modeled after the Navy's versions, and their operational dress uniform was modeled after the Coast Guard's version. In certain duty situations, a commissioned corps officer can be detailed to work with another [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed service]]. For example, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps|NOAA Corps]] does not commission medical officers, so the commissioned corps details medical officers to support NOAA Corps officers as needed. The commissioned corps also details a number of officers to support the Coast Guard's medical needs. Because of this close relationship, if a commissioned corps officer is on assignment with the Coast Guard, the officer is required to wear the same service uniforms as commissioned Coast Guard officers, but still bearing PHS Commissioned Corps insignia to identify them. The commissioned corps officer is subject to the grooming standards of the service to which attached for uniform appearance.\n\n== Commissioned officers ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"\n!colspan=11| '''Commissioned officer ranks, pay grades, titles and abbreviations of the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps'''\n|-\n![[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]]\n![[Lieutenant (junior grade)|Lieutenant<br/>(junior grade)]]\n![[Lieutenant]]\n![[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant commander]]\n![[Commander (United States)|Commander]]\n![[Captain (USPHCC)|Captain]]\n|-\n!O-1\n!O-2\n!O-3\n!O-4\n!O-5\n!O-6\n|-\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US PHS O1 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US PHS O2 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US PHS O-3 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US PHS O4 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US PHS O5 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US PHS O6 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|-\n!Junior assistant\n!Assistant\n!Senior assistant\n!Full\n!Senior\n!Director\n|-\n!ENS\n!LTJG\n!LT\n!LCDR\n!CDR\n!CAPT\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n![[Rear admiral (United States)#Rear admiral (lower half)|Rear admiral (lower half)]]\n![[Rear admiral (United States)#Rear admiral|Rear admiral]]\n![[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice admiral]]\n![[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]]\n|-\n!O-7\n!O-8\n!O-9\n!O-10\n|-\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20%\"| [[File:US PHS O7 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20%\"| [[File:US PHS O8 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20%\"| [[File:US PHS O9 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20%\"| [[File:US PHS O10 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|-\n!Assistant surgeon general\n!Deputy surgeon general or<br/>Assistant surgeon general\n![[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon general]]\n![[Assistant Secretary for Health]]\n|-\n!RADM<ref>{{cite web|title=HHS Promotion Letter|url=http://www.coausphs.org/docs/news/OSG_Announcement_FlagOfficers_2012.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120035449/http://www.coausphs.org/docs/news/OSG_Announcement_FlagOfficers_2012.pdf|archive-date=20 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n!RADM \n!VADM\n!ADM\n|}\n\n==Officer specialty rates==\n\nThe members of the Commissioned Corps number over 6,000 officers in 11 professional categories: \n*[[Dentist]]\n*[[Dietitian]]\n*[[Engineer]]\n*[[Environmental health officer]]s\n*[[Health service|Health service officers]]\n*[[Nurse]]\n*[[Physician |Medical Officer]]\n*[[Pharmacist]]\n*[[Scientist]]\n*[[Therapist]] (including [[Physical therapy|physical]], [[Occupational therapist|occupational]], [[Speech and language pathology|speech]], [[respiratory]])\n*[[Veterinarian]]\n\nThe Health Services Officer (HSO) category comprises over 50 allied health specialties, including [[audiology]], [[social work]]ers, [[physician assistant]]s, [[optometrist]]s, [[statistician]]s, [[computer scientist]]s, [[dental hygienist]]s, [[medical record]]s administrators, [[medical technologist]]s and others.\n\nThe commissioned corps uses the same commissioned officer [[military rank|rank structure]] as the United States [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]: from [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] to [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] (O-1 through O-10).  Commissioned Corps officers are typically appointed via [[Direct commission officer|direct commission]], and receive the same [[United States Military Pay|pay]] and benefits as other members of the [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]]. They cannot hold a dual commission with another uniformed service but inter-service transfers are permitted.\n\nThe commissioned corps may be militarized by the President. 42 USC 217 states:\n<blockquote><poem>In time of war, or of emergency involving the national defense proclaimed by the President, he may by Executive order declare the commissioned corps of the Service to be a military service. Upon such declaration, and during the period of such war or such emergency or such part thereof as the President shall prescribe, the commissioned corps (a) shall constitute a branch of the land and naval forces of the United States, (b) shall, to the extent prescribed by regulations of the President, be subject to the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] [10 U.S.C. 801 et seq.], and (c) shall continue to operate as part of the Service except to the extent that the President may direct as Commander in Chief.</poem></blockquote>\n\n===Warrant officers===\nThe commissioned corps is authorized to use [[Warrant officer (United States)|warrant officer]] ranks W-1 to W-4 under the [[United States Code|U.S. Code of law]],<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|42|204}} - Commissioned Corps and Ready Reserve Corps<br/>{{UnitedStatesCode|42|207}} - Grades, ranks, and titles of commissioned corps<br/>{{UnitedStatesCode|42|209}} - Appointment of personnel</ref> but does not currently use these ranks.\n\n=== Ready Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps ===\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed by President Obama on 23 March 2010, established the Ready Reserve Corps as the new surge capacity for the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service. In addition, all Reserve Corps officers who were serving on extended active duty on 23 March 2010, were converted to Regular Corps officers. The same legislation also abolished the Inactive Reserve Corps (IRC) on 23 March 2010, and consequently the commissions of the existing 10,000 commissioned corps IRC officers. The Office of Reserve Affairs (ORA) sent letters to those individuals, notifying them of their change of status.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dcp.psc.gov/ccbulletin/articles/Reserve_Update.aspx|title=Ready Reserve Corps Update|last=|first=|date=2 September 2010|website=US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|publisher=Office of Reserve Affairs, Commissioned Corps E-Bulletin|accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe IRC served as an asset for the commissioned corps. Inactive reservists voluntarily activated to provide over 3,000 active-duty days annually for routine and public health emergencies including during Hurricane Katrina and other emergency response missions and in providing surge capacity for numerous shortages in isolated and hardship underserved areas. Inactive reservists also played roles in the humanitarian shipboard training missions with other uniformed services.\n\nCongress established the Ready Reserve Corps to fulfill the need to have additional commissioned corps personnel available on short notice to assist Regular Corps personnel to meet both routine public health and emergency response missions. The Ready Reserve Corps officers will be available and ready for involuntary calls to active duty during national emergencies and public health crises.\n\nBecause of the changes in the law, a Ready Reserve Corps Working Integrated Project Team (WIPT) was convened in April 2010 to propose policy concepts, a strategic framework, and a budget for the Ready Reserve Corps. The WIPT submitted its final report to the Office of Commissioned Corps Force Management (OCCFM) in June 2010, and OCCFM forwarded the recommendations of the WIPT to the Assistant Secretary for Health for review and approval. As of late 2016, the directives and policies to implement the Ready Reserve await Secretarial decisions needed to implement the 2010 law. \n\nStandards for appointment into the Ready Reserve Corps and related proposed directives and policies remain under review. ORA is not accepting applications for the Ready Reserve Corps at this time, but will begin accepting applications after the Secretary issues the implementing directives. \n\nORA, in collaboration with OCCFM and the Office of Commissioned Corps Operations, will continue to coordinate Ready Reserve Corps initiatives and communications. When information is available on the appointment criteria, policies, and application procedures, updates will appear on the USPHS Web site at https://web.archive.org/web/20090506174822/http://www.usphs.gov/ and the Commissioned Corps Management Information System Web site at http://dcp.psc.gov.

The Marine Hospital Service was charged with the care and maintenance of merchant sailors, but as the country grew, so did the ever-expanding mission of the service. The Marine Hospital Service soon began taking on new expanding health roles that included such health initiatives that protected the commerce and health of America. One such role was [[quarantine]].\n\n[[John Maynard Woodworth]], a famous surgeon of the Union Army who served under General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], was appointed in 1871 as the Supervising Surgeon. Woodworth's title was later changed to \"Supervising Surgeon General,\" which later became the [[Surgeon General of the United States]]. Woodworth is credited with the formal creation of the Commissioned Corps. Woodworth organized the Marine Hospital Service medical personnel along Army military structure in 1889 to facilitate a mobile force of health professionals that could be moved for the needs of the service and country. He established appointment standards and designed the Marine Hospital Service herald of a [[Foul (nautical)#Fouled anchor|fouled anchor]] and [[Caduceus as a symbol of medicine|caduceus]]. Later that year of 1889, President Grover Cleveland signed an Act into law that formally established the modern Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (then the [[Marine Hospital Service]] under the Supervising Surgeon (later Surgeon General)). At first open only to [[physician]]s, over the course of the twentieth century, the Corps expanded to 11 careers in a wide range of specialties to include veterinarians, [[dentist]]s, engineers, [[pharmacist]]s, [[nurse]]s, environmental health specialists, [[scientist]]s, dietitians, and other [[allied health professional]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://usphs.gov/profession/|title=USPHS: Career & Benefits|website=usphs.gov|access-date=2016-11-06}}</ref>\n\nToday, the commissioned corps is under the [[United States Public Health Service]] (PHS), a major agency now of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), established by Congress in 1979-1980. It was previously established in 1953 as the [[United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare|U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] (HEW), and is still led by the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]]. The commissioned corps allocates officers to all seven uniformed services depending on the health or medical needs of the other uniformed services. The commissioned corps was featured in the 1950 motion picture [[Panic in the Streets (film)|''Panic in the Streets'']], in which [[Richard Widmark]] portrayed a Public Health Service physician tracking down a victim of [[pneumonic plague]], an infectious disease that is one of three forms of [[plague]], the other two being [[septicemic plague]] and [[bubonic plague]].\n\n==Purpose==\nThe stated mission of the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service is \"Protecting, promoting, and advancing the health and safety of the Nation\" in accordance with the commissioned corps's four Core Values: Leadership, Excellence, Integrity, and Service. Officers execute the mission of the commissioned corps in the following ways:\n*Help provide healthcare and related services to medically underserved populations: to [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]], [[Alaska Natives]], and to other population groups with special needs;\n*Prevent and control disease, identify health hazards in the environment and help correct them, and promote healthy lifestyles for the nation's citizens;\n*Improve the nation's mental health; \n*Ensure that drugs and medical devices are safe and effective, food is safe and wholesome, cosmetics are harmless, and that electronic products do not expose users to dangerous amounts of radiation;\n*Conduct and support biomedical, behavioral, and health services research, and communicate research results to health professionals and the public; and\n*Work with other nations and international agencies on global health problems and their solutions.\n\nPlus, the commissioned corps provides officers (Medical Officers, Dental Officers, Therapists, Environmental Health Officers, etc.) to other uniformed services, primarily the [[United States Coast Guard]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps]] (NOAA Corps). Commissioned corps officers may be detailed to other federal agencies including the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[TRICARE]], [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] ([[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]), [[United States Department of State|State Department]], [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], and the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] ([[National Park Service]]). Commissioned corps officers may develop individual memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with other organizations, including state and local health agencies, and even non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\n\nThe Commissioned Corps is often called upon by other federal, state, and local agencies to aid and augment in times when those agencies' resources are overwhelmed. These responses are designated as deployments by the commissioned corps, if the deployment is outside of the officer's \"normal\" duties, and coordinated through the commissioned corps's Readiness and Deployment Operations Group (REDDOG) in the Division of Commissioned Corps Personnel and Readiness (DCCPR).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usphs.gov/newsroom/features/recent/deployments.aspx|title=Commisisoned Corps Deployments: Public Health Emergency Responders|last=|first=|date=September 19, 2014|website=Usphs.gov|access-date=2016-11-06}}</ref> Deployments may be for technical needs in standard settings, or in the event of disasters, in austere environments.\n\n==Deployments==\nThe commissioned corps is often deployed as part of the [[National Response Framework]] Emergency Support Function #8 \u2013 Public Health and Medical Services, but can be deployed outside of the Framework for various needs to other federal agencies, states, local governments, or even to aid foreign governments. Like all other federal-level responses, commissioned corps officers are deployed only upon request, and upon the recommendation of the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] and permission of the [[Assistant Secretary for Health]]. During deployments, commissioned corps officers may report to regular office spaces, such as coordinating responses at state-of-the-art emergency operations centers, or into the field in extremely austere environments, such as when responding to a natural disaster. In addition, deployments may either be on an individual basis, such as when specific skill sets are needed, or as part of a team, when large-scale responses are needed.\n\nThe commissioned corps uses a tiered system of response, with Tier 1 response teams ready and able to respond to an event within 12 hours, and Tier 2 teams ready and able to respond within 36 hours. Officers not on Tier 1 or 2 teams are Tier 3 responders, ready and able to respond to an event in 72 hours. Tier 1 teams are primarily made up of Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) teams that are made up of over 100 officers with multiple specialties, and are focused on providing acute clinical care of disaster-exacerbated chronic conditions. Officers who do not work as a clinical care provider on one of these teams are often in support roles, such as logistics, administration/finance, or planning. Tier 2 teams are composed of a smaller, more specialized workforce. Current Tier 2 teams include the Applied Public Health Team (APHT), the Mental Health Team (MHT), and the Services Access Team (SAT). Tier 3 commissioned corps officers not already assigned to one of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 teams are used to augment the Tier 1 and Tier 2 teams in the event of staffing shortages due to availability, or the need to scale up a response.\n\nThey are trained and equipped to respond to public health crises and national emergencies, such as natural disasters, disease outbreaks, or terrorist attacks. The teams are multidisciplinary and are capable of responding to domestic and international humanitarian missions.

PHS Corps officers have been part of the Navy's [[Pacific Partnership]] (in the Pacific basin) and [[Operation Continuing Promise|Continuing Promise]] (in the Caribbean/west Atlantic) since 2007. Such missions are often carried out on either the US Navy's commissioned hospital ships, the {{USNS|Mercy|T-AH-19}} or {{USNS|Comfort|T-AH-20}}, though other ships, such as the amphibious assault ship {{USS|Bataan|LHD-5}}, have also been used. The command staff of the PHS deployed team(s) is deployed for the entire mission duration (often three months), while operational personnel serve one month aboard, meeting and departing the ships at the ports of call during the mission.\n\nThe commissioned corps, as a uniformed service, may be militarized and considered a branch of the armed forces by an act of Congress, or by executive order by the President of the United States, not only in time of war, but in \"an emergency involving the national defense proclaimed by the President.\" Major militarization of the corps occurred during [[World War II]] and another later during the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dcp.psc.gov/ccbulletin/PDF_docs/Oct01ccb.pdf|title=DCP.PSC.gov|website=Dcp.psc.gov|accessdate=2 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110005939/http://dcp.psc.gov/ccbulletin/PDF_docs/Oct01ccb.pdf|archive-date=10 November 2005|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Uniforms and insignia==\n{{Multiple image\n|footer    = '''USPHS Commissioned Corps uniforms'''\n|width1    = 125\n|image1    = service dress blues.jpg\n|alt1      = Service Dress Blues\n|caption1  = Service dress blues\n|width2    = 125\n|image2    = summer whites.jpg|130px\n|alt2      = Summer Whites\n|caption2  = Summer whites\n|width3    = 125\n|image3    = Summer khakis.jpg\n|alt3      = Service Khakis\n|caption3  = Service khakis\n|width4    = 263\n|image4    = US Public Health Service Operation United Assistance 2014.jpg\n|alt4      = USCG, NOAA Corps, and USPHS Operational Dress Uniform\n|caption4  = [[Operational Dress Uniform|Operational dress uniform]]\n}}\n{{Multiple image\n|width1    = 126\n|image1    = CAP DEVICE UNMOUNTED PHS.PNG\n|caption1  = PHSCC combination cap device\n|width2    = 122\n|image2    = PHSCC Collar Device.png\n|caption2  = PHSCC cap, collar, and sleeve device\n|width3    = 124\n|image3    = PHSCC Lapel Pin.png\n|caption3  = PHSCC lapel pin ''(for civilian dress)''\n|footer    = '''USPHS Commissioned Corps insignia'''\n}}\nCommissioned Corps officers wear uniforms similar to those of the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Coast Guard]] with special Public Health Service insignia. Their service dress blues, summer whites, and their service khakis have been modeled after the Navy's versions, and their operational dress uniform was modeled after the Coast Guard's version. In certain duty situations, a commissioned corps officer can be detailed to work with another [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed service]]. For example, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps|NOAA Corps]] does not commission medical officers, so the commissioned corps details medical officers to support NOAA Corps officer as needed. The commissioned corps also details a number of officers to support the Coast Guard's medical needs. Because of this close relationship, if a commissioned corps officer is on assignment with the Coast Guard, the officer is required to wear the same service uniforms as commissioned Coast Guard officers, but still bearing PHS Commissioned Corps insignia to identify them. The commissioned corps officer is subject to the grooming standards of the service to which attached for uniform appearance.\n\n== Commissioned officers ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"\n!colspan=11| '''Commissioned officer ranks, pay grades, titles and abbreviations of the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps'''\n|-\n![[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]]\n![[Lieutenant (junior grade)|Lieutenant<br/>(junior grade)]]\n![[Lieutenant]]\n![[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant commander]]\n![[Commander (United States)|Commander]]\n![[Captain (USPHCC)|Captain]]\n|-\n!O-1\n!O-2\n!O-3\n!O-4\n!O-5\n!O-6\n|-\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US PHS O1 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US PHS O2 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US PHS O-3 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US PHS O4 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US PHS O5 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"16%\"| [[File:US PHS O6 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|-\n!Junior assistant\n!Assistant\n!Senior assistant\n!Full\n!Senior\n!Director\n|-\n!ENS\n!LTJG\n!LT\n!LCDR\n!CDR\n!CAPT\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n![[Rear admiral (United States)#Rear admiral (lower half)|Rear admiral (lower half)]]\n![[Rear admiral (United States)#Rear admiral|Rear admiral]]\n![[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice admiral]]\n![[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]]\n|-\n!O-7\n!O-8\n!O-9\n!O-10\n|-\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20%\"| [[File:US PHS O7 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20%\"| [[File:US PHS O8 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20%\"| [[File:US PHS O9 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| align=\"center\" width=\"20%\"| [[File:US PHS O10 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|-\n!Assistant surgeon general\n!Deputy surgeon general or<br/>Assistant surgeon general\n![[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon general]]\n![[Assistant Secretary for Health]]\n|-\n!RADM<ref>{{cite web|title=HHS Promotion Letter|url=http://www.coausphs.org/docs/news/OSG_Announcement_FlagOfficers_2012.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120035449/http://www.coausphs.org/docs/news/OSG_Announcement_FlagOfficers_2012.pdf|archive-date=20 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n!RADM \n!VADM\n!ADM\n|}\n\n==Officer specialty rates==\n\nThe members of the Commissioned Corps number over 6,000 officers in 11 professional categories: \n*[[Dentist]]\n*[[Dietitian]]\n*[[Engineer]]\n*[[Environmental health officer]]s\n*[[Health service|Health service officers]]\n*[[Nurse]]\n*[[Physician |Medical Officer]]\n*[[Pharmacist]]\n*[[Scientist]]\n*[[Therapist]] (including [[Physical therapy|physical]], [[Occupational therapist|occupational]], [[Speech and language pathology|speech]], [[respiratory]])\n*[[Veterinarian]]\n\nThe Health Services Officer (HSO) category comprises over 50 allied health specialties, including [[audiology]], [[social work]]ers, [[physician assistant]]s, [[optometrist]]s, [[statistician]]s, [[computer scientist]]s, [[dental hygienist]]s, [[medical record]]s administrators, [[medical technologist]]s and others.\n\nThe commissioned corps uses the same commissioned officer [[military rank|rank structure]] as the United States [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]: from [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] to [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] (O-1 through O-10).  Commissioned Corps officers are typically appointed via [[Direct commission officer|direct commission]], and receive the same [[United States Military Pay|pay]] and benefits as other members of the [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]]. They cannot hold a dual commission with another uniformed service but inter-service transfers are permitted.\n\nThe commissioned corps may be militarized by the President. 42 USC 217 states:\n<blockquote><poem>In time of war, or of emergency involving the national defense proclaimed by the President, he may by Executive order declare the commissioned corps of the Service to be a military service. Upon such declaration, and during the period of such war or such emergency or such part thereof as the President shall prescribe, the commissioned corps (a) shall constitute a branch of the land and naval forces of the United States, (b) shall, to the extent prescribed by regulations of the President, be subject to the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] [10 U.S.C. 801 et seq.], and (c) shall continue to operate as part of the Service except to the extent that the President may direct as Commander in Chief.</poem></blockquote>\n\n===Warrant officers===\nThe commissioned corps is authorized to use [[Warrant officer (United States)|warrant officer]] ranks W-1 to W-4 under the [[United States Code|U.S. Code of law]],<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|42|204}} - Commissioned Corps and Ready Reserve Corps<br/>{{UnitedStatesCode|42|207}} - Grades, ranks, and titles of commissioned corps<br/>{{UnitedStatesCode|42|209}} - Appointment of personnel</ref> but does not currently use these ranks.\n\n=== Ready Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps ===\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed by President Obama on 23 March 2010, established the Ready Reserve Corps as the new surge capacity for the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service. In addition, all Reserve Corps officers who were serving on extended active duty on 23 March 2010, were converted to Regular Corps officers. The same legislation also abolished the Inactive Reserve Corps (IRC) on 23 March 2010, and consequently the commissions of the existing 10,000 commissioned corps IRC officers. The Office of Reserve Affairs (ORA) sent letters to those individuals, notifying them of their change of status.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dcp.psc.gov/ccbulletin/articles/Reserve_Update.aspx|title=Ready Reserve Corps Update|last=|first=|date=2 September 2010|website=US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|publisher=Office of Reserve Affairs, Commissioned Corps E-Bulletin|accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe IRC served as an asset for the commissioned corps. Inactive reservists voluntarily activated to provide over 3,000 active-duty days annually for routine and public health emergencies including during Hurricane Katrina and other emergency response missions and in providing surge capacity for numerous shortages in isolated and hardship underserved areas. Inactive reservists also played roles in the humanitarian shipboard training missions with other uniformed services.\n\nCongress established the Ready Reserve Corps to fulfill the need to have additional commissioned corps personnel available on short notice to assist Regular Corps personnel to meet both routine public health and emergency response missions. The Ready Reserve Corps officers will be available and ready for involuntary calls to active duty during national emergencies and public health crises.\n\nBecause of the changes in the law, a Ready Reserve Corps Working Integrated Project Team (WIPT) was convened in April 2010 to propose policy concepts, a strategic framework, and a budget for the Ready Reserve Corps. The WIPT submitted its final report to the Office of Commissioned Corps Force Management (OCCFM) in June 2010, and OCCFM forwarded the recommendations of the WIPT to the Assistant Secretary for Health for review and approval. As of late 2016, the directives and policies to implement the Ready Reserve await Secretarial decisions needed to implement the 2010 law. \n\nStandards for appointment into the Ready Reserve Corps and related proposed directives and policies remain under review. ORA is not accepting applications for the Ready Reserve Corps at this time, but will begin accepting applications after the Secretary issues the implementing directives. \n\nORA, in collaboration with OCCFM and the Office of Commissioned Corps Operations, will continue to coordinate Ready Reserve Corps initiatives and communications. When information is available on the appointment criteria, policies, and application procedures, updates will appear on the USPHS Web site at https://web.archive.org/web/20090506174822/http://www.usphs.gov/ and the Commissioned Corps Management Information System Web site at http://dcp.psc.gov. As soon as the appointment standards are available, qualified individuals are encouraged to apply for appointment into the Ready Reserve Corps.\n\n==March of the United States Public Health Service==\nLike most other [[U.S. uniformed services]], the U.S. Public Health Service has a march and accompanying lyrics.

While India is more often known for its ([[Hindustani classical music|northern]] and [[Carnatic music|southern]]) [[Indian classical music|classical music]], [[filmi]], [[Bollywood music]], [[Indi-pop]], and [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]], the Indian rock scene has also produced numerous bands and artists.\n\n==Early history==\nIndia, in the 1950s and 1960s, had a record industry in the Gramophone Company of India (an RCA/HMV/EMI subsidiary), and [[Long playing records|LPs]], [[Extended play|EPs]], and [[45rpm]] records were freely available, including those of [[rock and roll]] acts from the US and Britain, but also of contemporary pioneering Indian rock bands. The president of the firm, [[Bhaskar Menon]] (who later became the President of [[Capitol Records]] in the United States) was the leading promoter of Western pop music in India. Later in 1970, [[Polydor]], the German Label, began an India label distributing rock music.\n\nOf these mid-1960s to early 70s [[Beat music|beat]] groups, as they was then termed, one of the most notable were the [[Mystiks]] from [[Mumbai|Bombay]], the [[Beat-X]] from [[Chennai|Madras]], and the Flintstone from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], who composed and played both early [[British Invasion]] influenced songs, and post-''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper]]'' [[hard rock]]. During this period from Delhi there were The Thunderbirds (featuring singer Ashwani Bali), and WAFWOT (also with Ashwani on vocals, with organist Mark Spevak, from the U.S.) These bands played regularly on the Indian university and college music circuits, and some had successful EP and LP releases. Also notable from this period (1964\u20131970) was the female [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]  singer, Usha Iyer, now [[Usha Uthup]], who had successful covers of \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]\" and [[The Kingston Trio]] song, \"Greenback Dollar\". A notable compilation LP titled \"Simla Beat '70\" was released during this period, from a contest of the same name. The winning bands recorded their versions of Western hard rock of the time. This tradition of covering Western rock would continue until the 1980s when it was more common to compose original songs.\n\nThe rock n' roll scene was also closely followed by ''[[The Statesman (India)|Junior Statesman]]'' (or ''JS''), a magazine started in 1965 contemporaneously with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in the US and [[NME]] in the UK.\n\n{{Listen\n| filename    = \n| title       = \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuchh Yahan\"\n| description = [[Asha Bhosle]]'s \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuch Yahan\" from the film ''[[Apradh]]'' (1972)\n| pos         = right\n}}\n\nLike Western rock musicians at the time, Indian musicians also began fusing rock with traditional Indian music from the mid-1960s onwards. Many of these songs were often ''[[filmi]]'' songs produced for popular [[Bollywood]] films, which often overshadowed the country's independent rock scene. Some of the more well known early rock songs (including styles such as [[funk rock]], [[pop rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[raga rock]], and [[soft rock]]) from Bollywood films include [[Mohammed Rafi]]'s \"[[Jaan Pehechan Ho]]\" in ''[[Gumnaam]]'' (1965), [[Kishore Kumar]]'s \"O Saathi Re\" in ''[[Muqaddar Ka Sikandar]]'' (1978), and [[Asha Bhosle]] songs such as \"[[Dum Maro Dum (song)|Dum Maro Dum]]\" in ''[[Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971 film)|Hare Rama Hare Krishna]]'' (1971), \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab\" in ''[[Apradh]]'' (1972), and \"Yeh Mera Dil Pyar Ka Diwana\" in ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'' (1978).\n\n===Indian influence on Western music===\n{{See also|Raga rock|Psychedelic rock|The Beatles in India}}\n\nIn the 1960s, renowned [[Western world|Western]] acts such as [[The Yardbirds]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Doors]] and [[The Byrds]] were notably influenced by [[Indian classical music]] as a way of reinforcing the [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] in their music. While [[jazz]] musicians, notably [[John Coltrane]], had ventured into Indian music and spiritualism (see [[Indo jazz]], [[Sitar in jazz]], and [[Jazz in India]]), the influence of Indian classical music on 1960s rock began in earnest with [[George Harrison]]'s [[Ravi Shankar]] inspired [[raga rock]] song \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\" in 1965 and The Beatles' very public sojourn with the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] at his [[ashram]] in [[Rishikesh]] in 1968, following the release of ''[[Sgt.

Raga rock led to the development of [[psychedelic rock]], which in turn laid the foundations for [[heavy metal music]].\n\nThe Indian rock scene would later give rise to one of the world's most famous rock stars, [[Freddie Mercury]], born Farrokh Bulsara.

After the band broke up, he moved in 1967 to England, where he later found breakthrough success after producing \"[[Kung Fu Fighting]]\" for [[Carl Douglas]].\n\n==1980s and 1990s==\n\nWhile the [[orientalism|orientalist]] trend of the 60s and 70s was by the 80s and 90s largely over, India itself continued to produce bands in various styles of rock music, from soft [[rock and roll]] and [[pop rock]], to [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]]. In the early 1980s, however, rock was largely overshadowed by [[disco]], which dominated [[Indian pop]] music up until the mid-1980s.\n\nWith the arrival of [[MTV]], tastes rapidly changed, encouraging bands to harden their style and focus more on underground styles such as [[death metal]], [[alternative rock|alternative metal]], and [[progressive rock]]. The 1990s saw the rise of a much larger following of various harder styles for this reason. Bands that had formed in the 80s, such as Rock Machine (who would later be known as [[Indus Creed]]) - (including Mahesh Tinnaikar, Uday Benegal, etc.)...altered their style with the influx of newer techniques and influences from the west. Notable suburban metal-blues bands with 1960s and 1970s metal influences included IIT Powaii based Axecalibre, fronted by Oliver Pinto, Prashant Nair and covered flamboyant guitar-based blues and hardcore metal including ballads. Contemporaries of the time were Easy Meat from Pune and Bands such as Holocaust, Morgue (fronted by vocalist Mrinal Das, Drummer Neeraj Kakoty, Ambar Das and Raju Seal on Twin Attack Guitars, Manas Chowdhury on Bass), Dorian Platonic from Guwahati, Assam, Grassroots Revival, Postmark, The Cannibals, Phoenix,Phynyx and Drixian Empire/Dark Crusader from Manipur. \n\nOthers formed in the 1990s with harder styles influenced by the growing split between popular rock, such as [[Britpop]], alternative styles, such as [[punk rock|punk]], and metal styles, such as [[thrash metal|thrash]]. The Indian subgenre of fusion, which encourages a similar blend of ancient Indian musical traditions with rock music to [[raga rock]], was also carried forward, and is perhaps the most unusual Indian style of rock. Needless to say the rise of Sanskrit Rock Band (The Army of Narasimha Dev) had sprung to instant success in no time, founded by Lead vocalist Biju Gangadharan from ISKCON background, is a Sanskrit scholar and a highly talented Master in composing Sanskrit mantras into modern age rock music. Biju Gangadharan is considered as Sanskrit Rock Guru with a stunning performance in 33 countries up his shoulder. His guitarist, Chandresh Kudwa, is the most successful lead guitarist in India, and his percussionist, Nishadh Chandra, turned out to be the busiest music programmer in Bollywood. It was during this time that [[Palash Sen]]'s Euphoria surfaced in the Indian scene as a straight ahead English rock band. The band later started writing in Hindi, and gave birth to what is now known as \"Hindi Rock\". Euphoria went on to become India's most popular, successful and commercially accepted Independent act.\n\n==2000s==\n\nThe current Indian rock scene has a larger following than ever (although it is still marginalized compared to Indian film music, particularly the [[filmi]] soundtracks of [[Bollywood]]) and may soon become recognized in the international arena, as various South American and Japanese bands have become. Recent entries into the rock music scene are increasingly becoming comparable in their production quality to Western bands, and have been compared favorably to other internationally recognized acts. Now digital technology is making it easier than ever for these bands to distribute and sell their music. Some British bands of South Asian origin, such as [[Swami (band)|Swami]] have, like their [[hip-hop]] counterparts, tried to enter the Indian market in addition to maintaining the traditional fanbase of non-resident Indians in United Kingdom, [[Indo-Canadians|Canada]] and the [[Indian American|United States]]. Others, such as [[Rudra (band)|Rudra]], have emerged from Indian communities in other Asian countries. Progress is certain for the Indian rock scene with the advent of entities that support this genre. [[Rock Street Journal]] and Rolling Stone India<ref>{{cite web|title=Rolling stone|url=http://rollingstoneindia.com/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> are the two major publications that have been promoting Indian rock bands. The scene has also been transformed by the online medium, and the subsequent rise of a number of online portals promoting Indian rock, most notably the indie music website NH7,<ref>{{cite web|title=NH7 Radio|url=http://nh7.in/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> Headbangers India,<ref>{{cite web|title=HeadBangers India|url=http://www.headbangers.in/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> IndianMusicMug,<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with UFO\u2019s guitarist Vinnie Moore|url=http://indianmusicmug.com/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> Unholy Maunder, IndianMusicRevolution, Indian Metal Scene etc.<ref>{{cite web|title=IMR|url=http://www.indianmusicrevolution.com/|accessdate=6 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105043221/http://indianmusicrevolution.com/|archive-date=5 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> and Metal Spree.\n\n== Sub-genres ==\n\n=== Raga rock ===\n{{Main article|Raga rock}}\n{{See also|Psychedelic rock}}\n\nIn the West, some groups, such as [[The Beatles]], traveled to India and incorporated aspects of Indian music, especially classical instruments such as the [[sitar]], into their music, often as a way of conjuring [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] 'Eastern' feelings. The term for this was [[raga rock]], and examples of it are [[The Beatles]] \"[[Love You To]]\", \"[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]\",\"[[Across the Universe]]\",\"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\", \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\", \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\"; [[The Rolling Stones]]' \"[[Paint it, Black]]\"; [[The Kinks]]' \"Fancy\"; [[The Doors]]' \"[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]\" and [[The Byrds]]' \"[[Eight Miles High]]\". A number of prolific Indian classical musicians such as [[Ravi Shankar]] aligned themselves with this trend, collaborating with Western artists. Indian bands themselves mainly covered early rock songs by pioneers of rock and roll in the United Kingdom and [[United States|America]], and only achieved recognition in popular culture by supporting film scores and Indian pop.\n\n=== Indian fusion ===\n{{main article|Indian fusion}}\n\nAn Indian subgenre of rock exists that focuses on blending traditional Indian styles of music with rock music. The term for non-Indian bands using Indian instrumentals and vocal in rock is [[raga rock]]. However, Indian fusion also encompasses attempts by Indian pop musicians and film composers to incorporate rock music into their work, starting in the 70s with film scores like those of the [[Amitabh Bachchan]] classics. The [[Brown Indian Band]] features accomplished Indian classical musicians in concert with jazz virtuosos. More recently the multi-cultural British band [[Botown]] have taken elements of Bollywood and fused them with soul and funk to great success. The New Delhi Based Band 'Ojapali' is also doing a lots of experiments with Electronica Fusion music and Folk music of the Assam Region.\nThe Kochi-based band [[Motherjane]] typifies bands producing this genre of music. [[Motherjane]] guitarist [[Baiju Dharmajan]] is a pioneer of introducing the guitar music style known as carnatic shredding. Bangalore based carnatic rock band [[Agam (band)|Agam]] and fusion rock outfit Divine Raaga, Kaav, Veenar are other examples of mature songmakers in the country.<ref>[http://www.musicmalt.com/2011/12/eastern-fare-rocks-trinity-guild-hall.html Bangalore - Music Malt]</ref>\nKarnatriix is another band which has defined a new genre of fusion music labelled 'New-age World music'. Their ever-evolving sound today registers as ideally in sync with the 21st century's pan-cultural landscape. The name 'KARNATRIIX' which is a word play, meaning 'Aural Trickery', openly defines their music. Mellifluous melodies and sophisticated phrases deep-rooted in Blues music with an Indian Classical touch, combined with raw percussion and electronically produced subtle beats, voices and effects, form the core essence of the Karnatriix's musical nature. Indian Guitarist [[Kapil Srivastava]] composed Rock and Raga Fusion music in his Indian Guitaroo Volume 1.<ref>{{cite news|title=ZeeNews|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/musicindia/kapil-srivastava-cuts-his-new-album-indian-guitaroo_91243.html|accessdate=5 February 2015|newspaper=ZeeNews}}</ref>. [[The_Iyer_Project_(band)|The Iyer Project]] is another Delhi based band that blends Carnatic style vocals and guitar playing influenced by Baiju Dharmajan and [[R. Prasanna]] with rock and roll and progressive rock.\n\n=== Indian funk ===\nIndian [[funk]] is a loose term describing the style of rock and roll which is sometimes blurred into the realms of pop and other genres. Whereas Indian fusion may only incorporate Indian styles into rock, or rock into Indian forms of music, Indian funk can be broadly defined as what rap-metal is to heavy metal - an infusion of elements from rap, reggae, pop and dance genres that some might consider to not be 'true' rock. Groups originating in South Asian communities in Western countries like Britain are noted for this style, with bands such as [[Swami (band)|Swami]] and [[Asian Dub Foundation]] using elements of [[UK garage]], [[Bhangra (music)|UK bhangra]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], such as synthesizers, rap vocals and [[phonograph|turntables]]. Also based in the UK, [[Botown]] take an approach inspired by [[Funkadelic]] with a large lineup of live musicians to blend Bollywood music with [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]]. Few rock bands such as Silent Echo (Delhi) and Psycho Frequency (Delhi) use a wide range of samples and mechanically evolved sounds.

The band is widely known for being the pioneers of Metal Music in Central India.]]\n\n===Vedic metal===\nThe heavy metal band M.A.I.D.S (Metal Aliens in Devil's Soul) laid the foundation of heavy metal and rock in South India, Madras in the early 90s. Singaporean band [[Rudra (band)|Rudra]] initially got their worldwide push from major heavy metal label Sonic Wave International. With their style of 'Vedic metal' based around Hindu themes, the band have gained some fame in South East Asia, fusing heavy metal with Indian traditional music, in the vein of Brazil's [[Sepultura]], although they do not use avant-garde instruments such as them. Many international critics from the United States, Germany, and other countries have given the band's albums rave reviews.\n\nSince the genre was pioneered by Rudra in the late 1990s, it has grown in popularity. Bands like Wingz of Vayraag (India), [[Aryadeva]] (Ukraine), Symmetry (Indonesia), Warriors of Peace (India), Asura (India), Advaita (India), The Aryan March (India), [[Bhairav (band)|Bhairav]] (India), Madhavas Rock Band (India), Narasimha (Singapore), Kaliyuga (Singapore), Azrael (Australia), Dying Out Flame (Nepal), Blue River (Sri Lanka), Punarjanma (India), and Kartikeya (Russia) have done pioneering work in the subgenre. Often, along with Vedic lyrics, the music has shades of [[Indian classical music]]. With the introduction of new subgenre of heavy metal, the Vedic-core bands like, Antim-Yuddha, [[Roktobeej]] are contributing to the rising Indian underground rock culture. The definitive album of this genre [[Rudra (band)|Rudra]]\u2019s [[The Aryan Crusade]] (2001). In addition, India has produced many heavy metal bands that combine ethnic-[[folk music]] with various forms of heavy metal to create other [[folk metal]] bands. Indian rock has been influenced by some notable cultural trends, and has in turn produced influences of its own. Indian musicians have also collaborated with other musicians from across the globe.\n\n====Heavy metal====\n\nMillennium was formed in 1988 as one of the first Indian metal bands, and it laid the foundation for the Indian heavy metal scene. [[Demonic Resurrection]] laid the foundation for Indian extreme metal early in 2000 when extreme metal in India was a scarce minority, since then it has garnered popularity especially in the underground scene and spawned many bands such as Corroded Dreams, Escher's Knot, Crypted, Bestial Murder, and some bands have adapted to black metal driven sound with a rawer sound and [[Satanism|satanic]] lyrics. Bands such as Dark Desolation from Bengaluru and [[Fortified Destruction]] from Chennai have gone down that path. Many prolific extreme metal bands have spawned from the Chennai local scenes like Siva from [[Crypted]], Abhijit Rao from Escher's Knot, Vyas \"Hex\" Manalan from Fortified Destruction who are all frontmen of their respective bands and all known for their extreme vocal capabilities and the addition of guitar in the case of Hex. With many extreme metal bands from other countries, such as Behemoth, Gojira, and Cradle of Filth are setting foot on the India. Some of the most popular heavy metal bands in India are Undying INC, Zygnema, Bhayanak Maut, Albatros, Noiseware, Abraxas, Devoid, Sceptre, Kryptos, The Down Troddence, Crypted, Halakuah, Inner Sanctum, Scribe, and Cosmic Infusion. New emerging bands from India are now focused on spreading heavy metal and extreme metal music to the masses; there are frequent heavy metal gigs across India; though it is a niche in the genre, more and more people are becoming aware of the genre and bands like Orcus, Carnage INC, Primitiv, Eternal Returns, Killchain to name a few. From Central India, [[Nicotine (Metal band)|Nicotine]], a band based in [[Indore]], is widely credited of being the one of the pioneers of [[heavy metal music]] in the region. In recent years, the a wave of Indian extreme metal bands are growing in popularity with bands like [[Brazen Molok]], being the flag bearer of this new wave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dnasyndication.com/dna/article/DNIND3926|title=Does Indore have the mettle for metal?|work=dnasyndication.com|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506213402/http://dnasyndication.com/dna/article/DNIND3926|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationinsider.net/detail_news.php?id=731|title=Metal mania|work=educationinsider.net|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315111040/http://www.educationinsider.net/detail_news.php?id=731|archive-date=15 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://epaper.dnaindia.com/story.aspx?id=42518&boxid=63886&ed_date=2014-01-06&ed_code=820076&ed_page=1|title=Indore has a bandtastic time!|work=dnaindia.com|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305021734/http://epaper.dnaindia.com/story.aspx?id=42518&boxid=63886&ed_date=2014-01-06&ed_code=820076&ed_page=1|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinlung.com/2011/01/10-famous-rock-bands-of-india.html|title=The 10 Famous Rock Bands of India - Sinlung|work=sinlung.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaonline.in/About/Culture/Best-Rock-Bands-In-India.html|title=Best Rock Bands In India|work=indiaonline.in|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkthroughindia.com/hot-trends/the-10-famous-rock-bands-of-india/|title=The 10 Famous Rock Bands of India|work=walkthroughindia.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2013/07/almost-there-6-awesome-indian-music-bands-to-look-forward-to/|title=Almost There: 6 Awesome Indian Music Bands To Look Forward To|work=Youth Ki Awaaz|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.witty9.com/list-of-top-10-famous-rock-bands-who-gave-a-new-defination-to-the-music/|title=# 12 Prominent Indian Rock Bands Who Gave a New Definition To The Music .|work=Witty9|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913222425/http://www.witty9.com/list-of-top-10-famous-rock-bands-who-gave-a-new-defination-to-the-music/|archive-date=13 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://travel.india.com/articles/12-cities-home-awesome-bands-probably-dint-know/|title=12 Cities That are Home to Awesome Bands and You Probably Din't Know It!|work=Travel India|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041806/http://travel.india.com/articles/12-cities-home-awesome-bands-probably-dint-know/|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toplisthub.com/top-10-rock-bands-in-india/|title=Top 10 Rock Bands in India|author=Neelima K|work=Top List Hub|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://epaper.dnaindia.com/epapermain.aspx?pgNo=4&edcode=820076&eddate=2013-6-26|title=DNA E-Paper - Daily News & Analysis -Mumbai,India|work=dnaindia.com|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319152138/http://epaper.dnaindia.com/epapermain.aspx?pgNo=4&edcode=820076&eddate=2013-6-26|archive-date=19 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Regional music scenes ==\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{or section|date=April 2019}}\n{{Cleanup|date=September 2019|reason=[[WP:LAUNDRY]]; excessively detailed|section}}\n}}\nMany cities and regions have produced collections of bands large enough to be classified as a scene within Indian rock.\n[[Shillong]], [[Chennai]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Bangalore]] have long been one of the principal founts of Indian rock and continues to produce bands regularly.<ref>[http://www.musicmalt.com/2015/04/16-rock-bands-from-north-east-india.html 16 Rock Bands from North-East India you don't want to miss], ''Music Malt''</ref>\n\n=== Bangalore scene ===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = Heavy Metal group [[Iron Maiden]] performing live in Bangalore (top) and [[Kryptos (band)|Kryptos]] performing at Harley Rock Riders Season III.

The live music scene of the twin cities Mumbai and Pune has been on a steep rise since 2005 with major International acts like [[Meshuggah]], [[Tesseract (band)|Tesseract]], [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]], Freak Kitchen, [[Sahg]]. Pune plays host to an annual musical festival, The NH7 Weekender, which takes place in the month of November and showcases international (mostly British) acts like [[Imogen Heap]], [[The Magic Numbers]], [[Asian Dub Foundation]] and [[Reverend Soundsystem]] to name a few.\n\n=== Ranchi scene ===\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|right|[[Highway 69 (band) | Highway 69's drummer]] receiving the Best Drummer award from [[Uday Benegal]] at Hornbill International Rock Contest 2017 in [[Nagaland]].]]\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the bands of Ranchi from Jharkhand state had to face discrimination and hardships. Over the years, this city has produced some of the finest rock and metal music bands but they have always gone unnoticed because of being from a small town. In the 1990s, bands like Genesis, Kaalmantra and Sparsh<ref name=\"The Times of India for 'Sparsh'\">{{cite web |title=Ranchi rock band to perform today|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Ranchi-rock-band-to-perform-today/articleshow/2639039.cms|publisher=The Times of India}}</ref> have been considered as the pioneers to rock and metal music in Jharkhand. The city has had various music festivals being organized since the 2000s and a few of them are still organized today with the biggest one being [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref name=\"The Telegraph for 'Thunderstrock Festival'\">{{cite web |title=Rock concert next month|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/rock-concert-next-month/cid/1310535|publisher=The Telegraph}}</ref> and other notable festivals are like Rock Jatra and Rhapsody.

The bands of Ranchi have been touring and performing across the country with currently [[Highway 69 (band)]] being the most notable one as it has performed extensively all over the country and has evolved with a huge fan base, followed by other bands like Reciprocal<ref name=\"The Avenue Mail\">{{cite web |title=Local rock bands ready to rock for voters\u2019 awareness in Ranchi|url=https://www.avenuemail.in/jamshedpur/local-rock-bands-ready-to-rock-for-voters-awareness-in-ranchi/132565/|publisher=The Avenue Mail}}</ref>, Existence, Vikrit, Iris 13 etc. Other active and notable bands from the 2010s were Genesis, Kaalmantra, Sparsh, 4 Degrees of Freedom, Conflicting Resonance etc.\n\n== Independent record labels ==\nMainstream record labels in India often ignore rock, with a few exceptions. Album sales range between a few hundred copies to a few thousand. They are rarely, if at all, affiliated to the Indian music industry, and sales are not usually monitored. Songs of Bollywood usually gain more popularity as compared to the songs of bands. This is a huge set back. Bands also fail to sell their songs throughout the country even after making it available to major music stores, this is only due to lack of interest of people in rock bands. There are only a few bands that have become successful in selling their songs throughout the country. People who enjoy rock get the songs of their favorite bands, just by a click from any music website (sometimes their songs are uploaded by website administrators just after the day of release, this is illegal as per copyright law, but even then no action is taken). Hence, overall sales become less than expected. Bands in India mostly perform live shows with low priced tickets (as low as Rs. 100 or even less). Probably, the growing and the upcoming generation will have interest in Indian Rock and Metal. But care has to be taken to retain the copyright of the music.\n\nThe future looks encouraging thanks to entities such as Green Ozone, [[DogmaTone]] Records, [[Cochym]] and [[Eastern Fare Music Foundation]], [[Infestdead Records]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tntmagazine.in/tnt-y-news/northeast-gets-its-first-metal-label-signs-savage-uk/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827041640/http://tntmagazine.in/tnt-y-news/northeast-gets-its-first-metal-label-signs-savage-uk/ |archive-date=27 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2012/08/23/india-gets-a-new-metal-label-signs-nwobhm-legend-savage-uk/</ref> that are dedicated to promoting and supporting Indian rock.\n\n==Documentary on Indian rock==\n\nIn 2008, music journalist Abhimanyu Kukreja directed Rockumentary - Becoming of Indian rock that was produced by NewsX and had a national TV release.

While India is more often known for its ([[Hindustani classical music|northern]] and [[Carnatic music|southern]]) [[Indian classical music|classical music]], [[filmi]], [[Bollywood music]], [[Indi-pop]], and [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]], the Indian rock scene has also produced numerous bands and artists.\n\n==Early history==\nIndia, in the 1950s and 1960s, had a record industry in the Gramophone Company of India (an RCA/HMV/EMI subsidiary), and [[Long playing records|LPs]], [[Extended play|EPs]], and [[45rpm]] records were freely available, including those of [[rock and roll]] acts from the US and Britain, but also of contemporary pioneering Indian rock bands. The president of the firm, [[Bhaskar Menon]] (who later became the President of [[Capitol Records]] in the United States) was the leading promoter of Western pop music in India. Later in 1970, [[Polydor]], the German Label, began an India label distributing rock music.\n\nOf these mid-1960s to early 70s [[Beat music|beat]] groups, as they was then termed, one of the most notable were the [[Mystiks]] from [[Mumbai|Bombay]], the [[Beat-X]] from [[Chennai|Madras]], and the Flintstone from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], who composed and played both early [[British Invasion]] influenced songs, and post-''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper]]'' [[hard rock]]. During this period from Delhi there were The Thunderbirds (featuring singer Ashwani Bali), and WAFWOT (also with Ashwani on vocals, with organist Mark Spevak, from the U.S.) These bands played regularly on the Indian university and college music circuits, and some had successful EP and LP releases. Also notable from this period (1964\u20131970) was the female [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]  singer, Usha Iyer, now [[Usha Uthup]], who had successful covers of \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]\" and [[The Kingston Trio]] song, \"Greenback Dollar\". A notable compilation LP titled \"Simla Beat '70\" was released during this period, from a contest of the same name. The winning bands recorded their versions of Western hard rock of the time. This tradition of covering Western rock would continue until the 1980s when it was more common to compose original songs.\n\nThe rock n' roll scene was also closely followed by ''[[The Statesman (India)|Junior Statesman]]'' (or ''JS''), a magazine started in 1965 contemporaneously with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in the US and [[NME]] in the UK.\n\n{{Listen\n| filename    = \n| title       = \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuchh Yahan\"\n| description = [[Asha Bhosle]]'s \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuch Yahan\" from the film ''[[Apradh]]'' (1972)\n| pos         = right\n}}\n\nLike Western rock musicians at the time, Indian musicians also began fusing rock with traditional Indian music from the mid-1960s onwards. Many of these songs were often ''[[filmi]]'' songs produced for popular [[Bollywood]] films, which often overshadowed the country's independent rock scene. Some of the more well known early rock songs (including styles such as [[funk rock]], [[pop rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[raga rock]], and [[soft rock]]) from Bollywood films include [[Mohammed Rafi]]'s \"[[Jaan Pehechan Ho]]\" in ''[[Gumnaam]]'' (1965), [[Kishore Kumar]]'s \"O Saathi Re\" in ''[[Muqaddar Ka Sikandar]]'' (1978), and [[Asha Bhosle]] songs such as \"[[Dum Maro Dum (song)|Dum Maro Dum]]\" in ''[[Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971 film)|Hare Rama Hare Krishna]]'' (1971), \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab\" in ''[[Apradh]]'' (1972), and \"Yeh Mera Dil Pyar Ka Diwana\" in ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'' (1978).\n\n===Indian influence on Western music===\n{{See also|Raga rock|Psychedelic rock|The Beatles in India}}\n\nIn the 1960s, renowned [[Western world|Western]] acts such as [[The Yardbirds]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Doors]] and [[The Byrds]] were notably influenced by [[Indian classical music]] as a way of reinforcing the [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] in their music. While [[jazz]] musicians, notably [[John Coltrane]], had ventured into Indian music and spiritualism (see [[Indo jazz]], [[Sitar in jazz]], and [[Jazz in India]]), the influence of Indian classical music on 1960s rock began in earnest with [[George Harrison]]'s [[Ravi Shankar]] inspired [[raga rock]] song \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\" in 1965 and The Beatles' very public sojourn with the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] at his [[ashram]] in [[Rishikesh]] in 1968, following the release of ''[[Sgt.

Raga rock led to the development of [[psychedelic rock]], which in turn laid the foundations for [[heavy metal music]].\n\nThe Indian rock scene would later give rise to one of the world's most famous rock stars, [[Freddie Mercury]], born Farrokh Bulsara.

After the band broke up, he moved in 1967 to England, where he later found breakthrough success after producing \"[[Kung Fu Fighting]]\" for [[Carl Douglas]].\n\n==1980s and 1990s==\n\nWhile the [[orientalism|orientalist]] trend of the 60s and 70s was by the 80s and 90s largely over, India itself continued to produce bands in various styles of rock music, from soft [[rock and roll]] and [[pop rock]], to [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]]. In the early 1980s, however, rock was largely overshadowed by [[disco]], which dominated [[Indian pop]] music up until the mid-1980s.\n\nWith the arrival of [[MTV]], tastes rapidly changed, encouraging bands to harden their style and focus more on underground styles such as [[death metal]], [[alternative rock|alternative metal]], and [[progressive rock]]. The 1990s saw the rise of a much larger following of various harder styles for this reason. Bands that had formed in the 80s, such as Rock Machine (who would later be known as [[Indus Creed]]) - (including Mahesh Tinnaikar, Uday Benegal, etc.)...altered their style with the influx of newer techniques and influences from the west. Notable suburban metal-blues bands with 1960s and 1970s metal influences included IIT Powaii based Axecalibre, fronted by Oliver Pinto, Prashant Nair and covered flamboyant guitar-based blues and hardcore metal including ballads. Contemporaries of the time were Easy Meat from Pune and Bands such as Holocaust, Morgue (fronted by vocalist Mrinal Das, Drummer Neeraj Kakoty, Ambar Das and Raju Seal on Twin Attack Guitars, Manas Chowdhury on Bass), Dorian Platonic from Guwahati, Assam, Grassroots Revival, Postmark, The Cannibals, Phoenix,Phynyx and Drixian Empire/Dark Crusader from Manipur. \n\nOthers formed in the 1990s with harder styles influenced by the growing split between popular rock, such as [[Britpop]], alternative styles, such as [[punk rock|punk]], and metal styles, such as [[thrash metal|thrash]]. The Indian subgenre of fusion, which encourages a similar blend of ancient Indian musical traditions with rock music to [[raga rock]], was also carried forward, and is perhaps the most unusual Indian style of rock. Needless to say the rise of Sanskrit Rock Band (The Army of Narasimha Dev) had sprung to instant success in no time, founded by Lead vocalist Biju Gangadharan from ISKCON background, is a Sanskrit scholar and a highly talented Master in composing Sanskrit mantras into modern age rock music. Biju Gangadharan is considered as Sanskrit Rock Guru with a stunning performance in 33 countries up his shoulder. His guitarist, Chandresh Kudwa, is the most successful lead guitarist in India, and his percussionist, Nishadh Chandra, turned out to be the busiest music programmer in Bollywood. It was during this time that [[Palash Sen]]'s Euphoria surfaced in the Indian scene as a straight ahead English rock band. The band later started writing in Hindi, and gave birth to what is now known as \"Hindi Rock\". Euphoria went on to become India's most popular, successful and commercially accepted Independent act.\n\n==2000s==\n\nThe current Indian rock scene has a larger following than ever (although it is still marginalized compared to Indian film music, particularly the [[filmi]] soundtracks of [[Bollywood]]) and may soon become recognized in the international arena, as various South American and Japanese bands have become. Recent entries into the rock music scene are increasingly becoming comparable in their production quality to Western bands, and have been compared favorably to other internationally recognized acts. Now digital technology is making it easier than ever for these bands to distribute and sell their music. Some British bands of South Asian origin, such as [[Swami (band)|Swami]] have, like their [[hip-hop]] counterparts, tried to enter the Indian market in addition to maintaining the traditional fanbase of non-resident Indians in United Kingdom, [[Indo-Canadians|Canada]] and the [[Indian American|United States]]. Others, such as [[Rudra (band)|Rudra]], have emerged from Indian communities in other Asian countries. Progress is certain for the Indian rock scene with the advent of entities that support this genre. [[Rock Street Journal]] and Rolling Stone India<ref>{{cite web|title=Rolling stone|url=http://rollingstoneindia.com/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> are the two major publications that have been promoting Indian rock bands. The scene has also been transformed by the online medium, and the subsequent rise of a number of online portals promoting Indian rock, most notably the indie music website NH7,<ref>{{cite web|title=NH7 Radio|url=http://nh7.in/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> Headbangers India,<ref>{{cite web|title=HeadBangers India|url=http://www.headbangers.in/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> IndianMusicMug,<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with UFO\u2019s guitarist Vinnie Moore|url=http://indianmusicmug.com/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> Unholy Maunder, IndianMusicRevolution, Indian Metal Scene etc.<ref>{{cite web|title=IMR|url=http://www.indianmusicrevolution.com/|accessdate=6 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105043221/http://indianmusicrevolution.com/|archive-date=5 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> and Metal Spree.\n\n== Sub-genres ==\n\n=== Raga rock ===\n{{Main article|Raga rock}}\n{{See also|Psychedelic rock}}\n\nIn the West, some groups, such as [[The Beatles]], traveled to India and incorporated aspects of Indian music, especially classical instruments such as the [[sitar]], into their music, often as a way of conjuring [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] 'Eastern' feelings. The term for this was [[raga rock]], and examples of it are [[The Beatles]] \"[[Love You To]]\", \"[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]\",\"[[Across the Universe]]\",\"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\", \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\", \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\"; [[The Rolling Stones]]' \"[[Paint it, Black]]\"; [[The Kinks]]' \"Fancy\"; [[The Doors]]' \"[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]\" and [[The Byrds]]' \"[[Eight Miles High]]\". A number of prolific Indian classical musicians such as [[Ravi Shankar]] aligned themselves with this trend, collaborating with Western artists. Indian bands themselves mainly covered early rock songs by pioneers of rock and roll in the United Kingdom and [[United States|America]], and only achieved recognition in popular culture by supporting film scores and Indian pop.\n\n=== Indian fusion ===\n{{main article|Indian fusion}}\n\nAn Indian subgenre of rock exists that focuses on blending traditional Indian styles of music with rock music. The term for non-Indian bands using Indian instrumentals and vocal in rock is [[raga rock]]. However, Indian fusion also encompasses attempts by Indian pop musicians and film composers to incorporate rock music into their work, starting in the 70s with film scores like those of the [[Amitabh Bachchan]] classics. The [[Brown Indian Band]] features accomplished Indian classical musicians in concert with jazz virtuosos. More recently the multi-cultural British band [[Botown]] have taken elements of Bollywood and fused them with soul and funk to great success. The New Delhi Based Band 'Ojapali' is also doing a lots of experiments with Electronica Fusion music and Folk music of the Assam Region.\nThe Kochi-based band [[Motherjane]] typifies bands producing this genre of music. [[Motherjane]] guitarist [[Baiju Dharmajan]] is a pioneer of introducing the guitar music style known as carnatic shredding. Bangalore based carnatic rock band [[Agam (band)|Agam]] and fusion rock outfit Divine Raaga, Kaav, Veenar are other examples of mature songmakers in the country.<ref>[http://www.musicmalt.com/2011/12/eastern-fare-rocks-trinity-guild-hall.html Bangalore - Music Malt]</ref>\nKarnatriix is another band which has defined a new genre of fusion music labelled 'New-age World music'. Their ever-evolving sound today registers as ideally in sync with the 21st century's pan-cultural landscape. The name 'KARNATRIIX' which is a word play, meaning 'Aural Trickery', openly defines their music. Mellifluous melodies and sophisticated phrases deep-rooted in Blues music with an Indian Classical touch, combined with raw percussion and electronically produced subtle beats, voices and effects, form the core essence of the Karnatriix's musical nature. Indian Guitarist [[Kapil Srivastava]] composed Rock and Raga Fusion music in his Indian Guitaroo Volume 1.<ref>{{cite news|title=ZeeNews|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/musicindia/kapil-srivastava-cuts-his-new-album-indian-guitaroo_91243.html|accessdate=5 February 2015|newspaper=ZeeNews}}</ref>. [[The_Iyer_Project_(band)|The Iyer Project]] is another Delhi based band that blends Carnatic style vocals and guitar playing influenced by Baiju Dharmajan and [[R. Prasanna]] with rock and roll and progressive rock.\n\n=== Indian funk ===\nIndian [[funk]] is a loose term describing the style of rock and roll which is sometimes blurred into the realms of pop and other genres. Whereas Indian fusion may only incorporate Indian styles into rock, or rock into Indian forms of music, Indian funk can be broadly defined as what rap-metal is to heavy metal - an infusion of elements from rap, reggae, pop and dance genres that some might consider to not be 'true' rock. Groups originating in South Asian communities in Western countries like Britain are noted for this style, with bands such as [[Swami (band)|Swami]] and [[Asian Dub Foundation]] using elements of [[UK garage]], [[Bhangra (music)|UK bhangra]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], such as synthesizers, rap vocals and [[phonograph|turntables]]. Also based in the UK, [[Botown]] take an approach inspired by [[Funkadelic]] with a large lineup of live musicians to blend Bollywood music with [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]]. Few rock bands such as Silent Echo (Delhi) and Psycho Frequency (Delhi) use a wide range of samples and mechanically evolved sounds.

The band is widely known for being the pioneers of Metal Music in Central India.]]\n\n===Vedic metal===\nThe heavy metal band M.A.I.D.S (Metal Aliens in Devil's Soul) laid the foundation of heavy metal and rock in South India, Madras in the early 90s. Singaporean band [[Rudra (band)|Rudra]] initially got their worldwide push from major heavy metal label Sonic Wave International. With their style of 'Vedic metal' based around Hindu themes, the band have gained some fame in South East Asia, fusing heavy metal with Indian traditional music, in the vein of Brazil's [[Sepultura]], although they do not use avant-garde instruments such as them. Many international critics from the United States, Germany, and other countries have given the band's albums rave reviews.\n\nSince the genre was pioneered by Rudra in the late 1990s, it has grown in popularity. Bands like Wingz of Vayraag (India), [[Aryadeva]] (Ukraine), Symmetry (Indonesia), Warriors of Peace (India), Asura (India), Advaita (India), The Aryan March (India), [[Bhairav (band)|Bhairav]] (India), Madhavas Rock Band (India), Narasimha (Singapore), Kaliyuga (Singapore), Azrael (Australia), Dying Out Flame (Nepal), Blue River (Sri Lanka), Punarjanma (India), and Kartikeya (Russia) have done pioneering work in the subgenre. Often, along with Vedic lyrics, the music has shades of [[Indian classical music]]. With the introduction of new subgenre of heavy metal, the Vedic-core bands like, Antim-Yuddha, [[Roktobeej]] are contributing to the rising Indian underground rock culture. The definitive album of this genre [[Rudra (band)|Rudra]]\u2019s [[The Aryan Crusade]] (2001). In addition, India has produced many heavy metal bands that combine ethnic-[[folk music]] with various forms of heavy metal to create other [[folk metal]] bands. Indian rock has been influenced by some notable cultural trends, and has in turn produced influences of its own. Indian musicians have also collaborated with other musicians from across the globe.\n\n====Heavy metal====\n\nMillennium was formed in 1988 as one of the first Indian metal bands, and it laid the foundation for the Indian heavy metal scene. [[Demonic Resurrection]] laid the foundation for Indian extreme metal early in 2000 when extreme metal in India was a scarce minority, since then it has garnered popularity especially in the underground scene and spawned many bands such as Corroded Dreams, Escher's Knot, Crypted, Bestial Murder, and some bands have adapted to black metal driven sound with a rawer sound and [[Satanism|satanic]] lyrics. Bands such as Dark Desolation from Bengaluru and [[Fortified Destruction]] from Chennai have gone down that path. Many prolific extreme metal bands have spawned from the Chennai local scenes like Siva from [[Crypted]], Abhijit Rao from Escher's Knot, Vyas \"Hex\" Manalan from Fortified Destruction who are all frontmen of their respective bands and all known for their extreme vocal capabilities and the addition of guitar in the case of Hex. With many extreme metal bands from other countries, such as Behemoth, Gojira, and Cradle of Filth are setting foot on the India. Some of the most popular heavy metal bands in India are Undying INC, Zygnema, Bhayanak Maut, Albatros, Noiseware, Abraxas, Devoid, Sceptre, Kryptos, The Down Troddence, Crypted, Halakuah, Inner Sanctum, Scribe, and Cosmic Infusion. New emerging bands from India are now focused on spreading heavy metal and extreme metal music to the masses; there are frequent heavy metal gigs across India; though it is a niche in the genre, more and more people are becoming aware of the genre and bands like Orcus, Carnage INC, Primitiv, Eternal Returns, Killchain to name a few. From Central India, [[Nicotine (Metal band)|Nicotine]], a band based in [[Indore]], is widely credited of being the one of the pioneers of [[heavy metal music]] in the region. In recent years, the a wave of Indian extreme metal bands are growing in popularity with bands like [[Brazen Molok]], being the flag bearer of this new wave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dnasyndication.com/dna/article/DNIND3926|title=Does Indore have the mettle for metal?|work=dnasyndication.com|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506213402/http://dnasyndication.com/dna/article/DNIND3926|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationinsider.net/detail_news.php?id=731|title=Metal mania|work=educationinsider.net|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315111040/http://www.educationinsider.net/detail_news.php?id=731|archive-date=15 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://epaper.dnaindia.com/story.aspx?id=42518&boxid=63886&ed_date=2014-01-06&ed_code=820076&ed_page=1|title=Indore has a bandtastic time!|work=dnaindia.com|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305021734/http://epaper.dnaindia.com/story.aspx?id=42518&boxid=63886&ed_date=2014-01-06&ed_code=820076&ed_page=1|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinlung.com/2011/01/10-famous-rock-bands-of-india.html|title=The 10 Famous Rock Bands of India - Sinlung|work=sinlung.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaonline.in/About/Culture/Best-Rock-Bands-In-India.html|title=Best Rock Bands In India|work=indiaonline.in|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkthroughindia.com/hot-trends/the-10-famous-rock-bands-of-india/|title=The 10 Famous Rock Bands of India|work=walkthroughindia.com|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2013/07/almost-there-6-awesome-indian-music-bands-to-look-forward-to/|title=Almost There: 6 Awesome Indian Music Bands To Look Forward To|work=Youth Ki Awaaz|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.witty9.com/list-of-top-10-famous-rock-bands-who-gave-a-new-defination-to-the-music/|title=# 12 Prominent Indian Rock Bands Who Gave a New Definition To The Music .|work=Witty9|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913222425/http://www.witty9.com/list-of-top-10-famous-rock-bands-who-gave-a-new-defination-to-the-music/|archive-date=13 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://travel.india.com/articles/12-cities-home-awesome-bands-probably-dint-know/|title=12 Cities That are Home to Awesome Bands and You Probably Din't Know It!|work=Travel India|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041806/http://travel.india.com/articles/12-cities-home-awesome-bands-probably-dint-know/|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toplisthub.com/top-10-rock-bands-in-india/|title=Top 10 Rock Bands in India|author=Neelima K|work=Top List Hub|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://epaper.dnaindia.com/epapermain.aspx?pgNo=4&edcode=820076&eddate=2013-6-26|title=DNA E-Paper - Daily News & Analysis -Mumbai,India|work=dnaindia.com|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319152138/http://epaper.dnaindia.com/epapermain.aspx?pgNo=4&edcode=820076&eddate=2013-6-26|archive-date=19 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Regional music scenes ==\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{or section|date=April 2019}}\n{{Cleanup|date=September 2019|reason=[[WP:LAUNDRY]]; excessively detailed|section}}\n}}\nMany cities and regions have produced collections of bands large enough to be classified as a scene within Indian rock.\n[[Shillong]], [[Chennai]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Bangalore]] have long been one of the principal founts of Indian rock and continues to produce bands regularly.<ref>[http://www.musicmalt.com/2015/04/16-rock-bands-from-north-east-india.html 16 Rock Bands from North-East India you don't want to miss], ''Music Malt''</ref>\n\n=== Bangalore scene ===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = Heavy Metal group [[Iron Maiden]] performing live in Bangalore (top) and [[Kryptos (band)|Kryptos]] performing at Harley Rock Riders Season III.

Over the years, this city has produced some of the finest rock and metal music bands but they have always gone unnoticed because of being from a small town. In the 1990s, bands like Genesis, Kaalmantra and Sparsh<ref name=\"The Times of India for 'Sparsh'\">{{cite web |title=Ranchi rock band to perform today|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Ranchi-rock-band-to-perform-today/articleshow/2639039.cms|publisher=The Times of India}}</ref> have been considered as the pioneers to rock and metal music in Jharkhand. The city has had various music festivals being organized since the 2000s and a few of them are still organized today with the biggest one being Thunderstrock Festival<ref name=\"The Telegraph for 'Thunderstrock Festival'\">{{cite web |title=Rock concert next month|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/rock-concert-next-month/cid/1310535|publisher=The Telegraph}}</ref> and other notable festivals are like Rock Jatra and Rhapsody.

The bands of Ranchi have been touring and performing across the country with currently [[Highway 69 (band)]] being the most notable one as it has performed extensively all over the country and has evolved with a huge fan base, followed by other bands like Reciprocal<ref name=\"The Avenue Mail\">{{cite web |title=Local rock bands ready to rock for voters\u2019 awareness in Ranchi|url=https://www.avenuemail.in/jamshedpur/local-rock-bands-ready-to-rock-for-voters-awareness-in-ranchi/132565/|publisher=The Avenue Mail}}</ref>, Existence, Vikrit, Iris 13 etc. Other active and notable bands from the 2010s were Genesis, Kaalmantra, Sparsh, 4 Degrees of Freedom, Conflicting Resonance etc.\n\n== Independent record labels ==\nMainstream record labels in India often ignore rock, with a few exceptions. Album sales range between a few hundred copies to a few thousand. They are rarely, if at all, affiliated to the Indian music industry, and sales are not usually monitored. Songs of Bollywood usually gain more popularity as compared to the songs of bands. This is a huge set back. Bands also fail to sell their songs throughout the country even after making it available to major music stores, this is only due to lack of interest of people in rock bands. There are only a few bands that have become successful in selling their songs throughout the country. People who enjoy rock get the songs of their favorite bands, just by a click from any music website (sometimes their songs are uploaded by website administrators just after the day of release, this is illegal as per copyright law, but even then no action is taken). Hence, overall sales become less than expected. Bands in India mostly perform live shows with low priced tickets (as low as Rs. 100 or even less). Probably, the growing and the upcoming generation will have interest in Indian Rock and Metal. But care has to be taken to retain the copyright of the music.\n\nThe future looks encouraging thanks to entities such as Green Ozone, [[DogmaTone]] Records, [[Cochym]] and [[Eastern Fare Music Foundation]], [[Infestdead Records]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tntmagazine.in/tnt-y-news/northeast-gets-its-first-metal-label-signs-savage-uk/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827041640/http://tntmagazine.in/tnt-y-news/northeast-gets-its-first-metal-label-signs-savage-uk/ |archive-date=27 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2012/08/23/india-gets-a-new-metal-label-signs-nwobhm-legend-savage-uk/</ref> that are dedicated to promoting and supporting Indian rock.\n\n==Documentary on Indian rock==\n\nIn 2008, music journalist Abhimanyu Kukreja directed Rockumentary - Becoming of Indian rock that was produced by NewsX and had a national TV release.

The band has been the winners of numerous battle of band titles across their country and is known for their fast tempos, instrumental and aggressive style of playing. The band has performed twice as the finalists at Hornbill International Rock Contest of [[Hornbill Festival]] in [[Nagaland]] for the year 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical route to national stage|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/musical-route-to-national-stage/cid/1342721|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nine bands to vie for Hornbill Rock Contest finale today|url=https://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nine-bands-to-vie-for-hornbill-rock-contest-finale-today/|website=Eastern Mirror Nagaland|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Their drummer has also bagged the title of the 'Best Drummer' in the year 2017 at this festival and was felicitated by [[Uday Benegal]] from the [[Indus Creed]] which is a band considered to be the pioneers of the Indian rock music.\n\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the band had to face discrimination and hardships in their path to fame. Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become an upcoming popular metal band from [[East India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Back then, Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] which is a city approximately 120 km from Ranchi. He was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial place where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians named Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. When Alvin and Tarang were forming a band and we're looking for band members, this is when Alvin suggested the names Binit and Dheeraj with whom he had already been performing. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and [[Thunderstrock Festival]] (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj and Alvin both use to be bandmates in their previous metal band. Both had high expectation from their band but weren't able to find that same spirit in that band so they left to form Highway 69. But even before completing one year as the drummer for Highway 69, Dheeraj decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first metropolitan show as a band which also required travelling of approximately 1,900 km from their hometown. The Bangalore show became the place where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest like [[Blackstratblues]], [[Karsh Kale]], [[Farhan Akhtar]] and many others. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting an inactive rock & metal music festival from their city called [[Thunderstrock Festival]]. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing this stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin and Dheeraj used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (John, the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nAfter a year since Dheeraj left the band, he again approached the band for joining it. He was considered in the band's line-up once again and eventually, Johnson had to leave who earlier came as the replacement in Dheeraj's place. With Dheeraj once again in the line-up, the band went for participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]], Ranchi, Thundermarch at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]] and Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]]. The band won the competitions at [[NIFFT]] Ranchi and IIT (ISM) Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at [[NIT Silchar]] (Later in 2016, the band was again shortlisted for the finals at NIT Silchar but they couldn't go to perform and in 2018, they were selected for the third time and this time they even won the competition). The band also headlined the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 in 2015 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nLater in the year 2015, Dheeraj again decided to leave the band as he wasn't able to continue with regular practice and cope up with Highway 69's regular participating in events which required a lot of travelling throughout the country. So they finally decided on having a permanent drummer who will be committed towards the band. During this time, the band practised with various drummers from [[Ranchi]], [[Jamshedpur]] and even [[Kolkata]] but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who was in the line-up of [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Highway 69's vocalist. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals across India. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and even John agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement but tensions grew in mid-2017 when due to personal misunderstandings within the band, he was asked to leave the band. But later in the same year itself, he again joined the band and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming along with going shirtless when performing on-stage.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During the span of 2015\u20132018, the band went to participate in festivals across India of which they won the competitions like Fuego - KIIT Fest of [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology]], [[Bhubaneswar]], Blizzard of Rock - Chaos of [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], Distortion - Culfest of [[National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur]], Rocktaves - Oasis of [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BITS PILANI OASIS ROCK EVENT: ROCKTAVES|url=https://atkt.in/articles/bits-pilani-oasis-rock-event-rocktaves/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Searock of [[Waves (festival) ]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Goa Campus]], Till Deaf Do We Part of [[Pearl (cultural festival)]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Hyderabad Campus]], Resonance of [[Festember]] at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]],<ref>{{cite web|title=METAL BAND HIGHWAY 69 WREAK HAVOC AT FESTEMBER|url=https://atkt.in/articles/highway-69-trichy/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Synchronicity of [[Antaragni]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]], Decibelz of Xpressions at [[Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar]] and Thundermarch of Incandescene at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]].

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain national recognization in the music scene and a good amount of fan following as well as positive reception and appreciation from fellow musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from [[Jamshedpur]] called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil, the band did a couple of shows with participation in the competition held at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and a music master class by Highway 69 at [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]] alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing new original songs by the band. The band went unto compose their originals like Beyond Imagination, Don't be the Prisoners, Hope and Origin. Apart from taking part in competitions, they headlined in music festivals of [[Jamshedpur]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Kolkata]] which eventually helped them gain the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when Tarang started the work for that year's [[Thunderstrock Festival]], he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69.

With having a long-list of competitions that the band has won, they have been booked as the judges for the competitions in which they themselves once used to be the participants.

It is India's only dedicated Heavy metal open-air music festival which takes place yearly in [[Bangalore]] in collaboration with [[Wacken Open Air]]. The winning band gets an opportunity to play at Wacken Open Air in Germany which is one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world. The band had earlier registered for the competition in 2017 but couldn't go to perform due to their bassist's unavailability. So they once again gave a try by participating in the competition in 2020 and were shortlisted for the Eastern India-leg of Wacken Metal Battle alongside other [[West Bengal]]-based bands. Highway 69 could not win the competition but the band shared the stage with some really great bands in the competition and witnessed the performance of headliners like [[Chronic Xorn]] and [[Kryptos]].\n\nThe band went for recording their debut album in 2018-2019 but were not impressed with the final recording, mixing and mastering done by the studio. This caused a huge loss for the band also in their album release dates. Currently, all the band members live in different places with Alvin in [[Ranchi]], Binit in [[Khelari]] and John in [[Khunti]] of [[Jharkhand]] state while Tarang lives in [[Angul]] of [[Odisha]] state of India. Despite living in different places, the band generally meets in weekdays for their band practice which requires all the members to take out time and travel to Ranchi (except Alvin who lives in Ranchi). Also with the loss suffered in their album recording, the band has cancelled the plan of recording its album and is currently recording three singles at music studios of [[Kolkata]]. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]], their recording dates have been postponed but the band has targeted to release these three singles along with its music videos in the year 2020 itself.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of instrument to reflect the timeline.-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* Tarang Kerketta \u2013 vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Alvin Rozario]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* Binit Barla \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* John Raj Swami \u2013 drums <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Dheeraj Edward \u2013 drums <small>(2012\u20132013 & 2015)</small>\n* Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu \u2013 drums <small>(2014)</small>\n* Nikhil Dhanraj \u2013 drums <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/2012 till:{{#time: m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2013\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2013\n\nColors =\n id:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\n id:guitar value:green  legend:Guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\n id:drums  value:orange legend:Drums\n id:studio value:black  legend:Studio_album\n\nLineData =\n layer:back\n color:studio\n at:03/21/2013\n at:03/21/2014\n at:03/21/2015\n at:03/21/2016\n at:03/21/2017\n at:03/21/2018\n at:03/21/2019\n at:03/21/2020\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tarang  text:\"Tarang Kerketta\"\n bar:Alvin   text:\"Alvin Rozario\"\n bar:Binit   text:\"Binit Barla\"\n bar:Dheeraj text:\"Dheeraj Edward\"\n bar:Johnson text:\"A.

The band has performed twice as the finalists at Hornbill International Rock Contest of [[Hornbill Festival]] in [[Nagaland]] for the year 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical route to national stage|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/musical-route-to-national-stage/cid/1342721|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nine bands to vie for Hornbill Rock Contest finale today|url=https://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nine-bands-to-vie-for-hornbill-rock-contest-finale-today/|website=Eastern Mirror Nagaland|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Their drummer has also bagged the title of the 'Best Drummer' in the year 2017 at this festival and was felicitated by [[Uday Benegal]] from the [[Indus Creed]] which is a band considered to be the pioneers of the Indian rock music.\n\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the band had to face discrimination and hardships in their path to fame. Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become an upcoming popular metal band from [[East India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Back then, Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] which is a city approximately 120 km from Ranchi. He was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial place where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians named Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. When Alvin and Tarang were forming a band and we're looking for band members, this is when Alvin suggested the names Binit and Dheeraj with whom he had already been performing. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and [[Thunderstrock Festival]] (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj and Alvin both use to be bandmates in their previous metal band. Both had high expectation from their band but weren't able to find that same spirit in that band so they left to form Highway 69. But even before completing one year as the drummer for Highway 69, Dheeraj decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first metropolitan show as a band which also required travelling of approximately 1,900 km from their hometown. The Bangalore show became the place where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest like [[Blackstratblues]], [[Karsh Kale]], [[Farhan Akhtar]] and many others. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting an inactive rock & metal music festival from their city called [[Thunderstrock Festival]]. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing this stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin and Dheeraj used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (John, the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nAfter a year since Dheeraj left the band, he again approached the band for joining it. He was considered in the band's line-up once again and eventually, Johnson had to leave who earlier came as the replacement in Dheeraj's place. With Dheeraj once again in the line-up, the band went for participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]], Ranchi, Thundermarch at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]] and Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]]. The band won the competitions at [[NIFFT]] Ranchi and IIT (ISM) Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at [[NIT Silchar]] (Later in 2016, the band was again shortlisted for the finals at NIT Silchar but they couldn't go to perform and in 2018, they were selected for the third time and this time they even won the competition). The band also headlined the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 in 2015 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nLater in the year 2015, Dheeraj again decided to leave the band as he wasn't able to continue with regular practice and cope up with Highway 69's regular participating in events which required a lot of travelling throughout the country. So they finally decided on having a permanent drummer who will be committed towards the band. During this time, the band practised with various drummers from [[Ranchi]], [[Jamshedpur]] and even [[Kolkata]] but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who was in the line-up of [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Highway 69's vocalist. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals across India. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and even John agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement but tensions grew in mid-2017 when due to personal misunderstandings within the band, he was asked to leave the band. But later in the same year itself, he again joined the band and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming along with going shirtless when performing on-stage.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During the span of 2015\u20132018, the band went to participate in festivals across India of which they won the competitions like Fuego - KIIT Fest of [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology]], [[Bhubaneswar]], Blizzard of Rock - Chaos of [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], Distortion - Culfest of [[National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur]], Rocktaves - Oasis of [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BITS PILANI OASIS ROCK EVENT: ROCKTAVES|url=https://atkt.in/articles/bits-pilani-oasis-rock-event-rocktaves/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Searock of [[Waves (festival) ]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Goa Campus]], Till Deaf Do We Part of [[Pearl (cultural festival)]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Hyderabad Campus]], Resonance of [[Festember]] at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]],<ref>{{cite web|title=METAL BAND HIGHWAY 69 WREAK HAVOC AT FESTEMBER|url=https://atkt.in/articles/highway-69-trichy/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Synchronicity of [[Antaragni]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]], Decibelz of Xpressions at [[Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar]] and Thundermarch of Incandescene at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]].

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain national recognization in the music scene and a good amount of fan following as well as positive reception and appreciation from fellow musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from [[Jamshedpur]] called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil, the band did a couple of shows with participation in the competition held at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and a music master class by Highway 69 at [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]] alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing new original songs by the band. The band went unto compose their originals like Beyond Imagination, Don't be the Prisoners, Hope and Origin. Apart from taking part in competitions, they headlined in music festivals of [[Jamshedpur]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Kolkata]] which eventually helped them gain the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when Tarang started the work for that year's Thunderstrock Festival, he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69. Also by the end of 2018 when the band was returning from Hornbill Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Ranchi bands Highway 69 and Vikrit in the finals|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/jharkhand/ranchi/news/ranchi-rock-band-highway-69-and-distorted-to-the-final-of-contest-035603-3389144.html|website=Dainik Bhaskar}}</ref> in Nagaland they decided to give an end to participating in music competitions and work in their debut album and give preference to booked shows. With having a long-list of competitions that the band has won, they have been booked as the judges for the competitions in which they themselves once used to be the participants.

It is India's only dedicated Heavy metal open-air music festival which takes place yearly in [[Bangalore]] in collaboration with [[Wacken Open Air]]. The winning band gets an opportunity to play at Wacken Open Air in Germany which is one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world. The band had earlier registered for the competition in 2017 but couldn't go to perform due to their bassist's unavailability. So they once again gave a try by participating in the competition in 2020 and were shortlisted for the Eastern India-leg of Wacken Metal Battle alongside other [[West Bengal]]-based bands. Highway 69 could not win the competition but the band shared the stage with some really great bands in the competition and witnessed the performance of headliners like [[Chronic Xorn]] and [[Kryptos]].\n\nThe band went for recording their debut album in 2018-2019 but were not impressed with the final recording, mixing and mastering done by the studio. This caused a huge loss for the band also in their album release dates. Currently, all the band members live in different places with Alvin in [[Ranchi]], Binit in [[Khelari]] and John in [[Khunti]] of [[Jharkhand]] state while Tarang lives in [[Angul]] of [[Odisha]] state of India. Despite living in different places, the band generally meets in weekdays for their band practice which requires all the members to take out time and travel to Ranchi (except Alvin who lives in Ranchi). Also with the loss suffered in their album recording, the band has cancelled the plan of recording its album and is currently recording three singles at music studios of [[Kolkata]]. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]], their recording dates have been postponed but the band has targeted to release these three singles along with its music videos in the year 2020 itself.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of instrument to reflect the timeline.-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* Tarang Kerketta \u2013 vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Alvin Rozario]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* Binit Barla \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* John Raj Swami \u2013 drums <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Dheeraj Edward \u2013 drums <small>(2012\u20132013 & 2015)</small>\n* Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu \u2013 drums <small>(2014)</small>\n* Nikhil Dhanraj \u2013 drums <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/2012 till:{{#time: m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2013\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2013\n\nColors =\n id:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\n id:guitar value:green  legend:Guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\n id:drums  value:orange legend:Drums\n id:studio value:black  legend:Studio_album\n\nLineData =\n layer:back\n color:studio\n at:03/21/2013\n at:03/21/2014\n at:03/21/2015\n at:03/21/2016\n at:03/21/2017\n at:03/21/2018\n at:03/21/2019\n at:03/21/2020\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tarang  text:\"Tarang Kerketta\"\n bar:Alvin   text:\"Alvin Rozario\"\n bar:Binit   text:\"Binit Barla\"\n bar:Dheeraj text:\"Dheeraj Edward\"\n bar:Johnson text:\"A.

For [[backpacking (travel)|backpackers]], culture and [[nature]] lovers, beach-lovers, military soldiers and veterans, Vietnam has become a new tourist destination in Southeast Asia. Local and international tour operators offer tours to ethnic minority groups, walking and bicycle tours, photography tours, kayak trips and multi-country trips in particular with neighboring [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]] and Thailand. Foreign tourists have been able to travel freely in the country since 1997.\n\nThe [[economy of Vietnam]] has transformed from an agrarian to a service economy. More than a third of gross domestic product is generated by services, which include the hotel and catering industry and transportation. The manufacturing and construction (28 percent), agriculture and fisheries (20 percent) and mining (10 percent) have much smaller shares.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gtai.de/ext/anlagen/PubAnlage_6108.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719034804/http://www.gtai.de/ext/anlagen/PubAnlage_6108.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2019}}\n\nTourism contributes 4.5 percent to gross domestic product (as of 2007).

The term refers to [[Cash (Chinese coin)|Chinese bronze coins]] used as currency during the dynastic periods of China and Vietnam.\nThe term ''h\u00e0o'' is a loanword from the Chinese ''h\u00e1o'' (Chinese: \u6beb), meaning a tenth of a currency unit.\nThe term ''xu'' comes from French ''sous'' meaning \"penny\".  \nThe sign is encoded {{unichar|20AB|DONG SIGN|html=}}.\n\n==History==\n===North Vietnam===<!-- This section is linked from [[North Vietnam]] -->\n{{Main|North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng}}\n\nIn 1946, the [[Viet Minh]] government (later to become the government of North Vietnam) introduced its own currency, the \u0111\u1ed3ng, to replace the [[French Indochinese piastre]] at [[par value|par]]. Two revaluations followed, in 1951 and 1959; the first was at a rate of 100:1, the second at a rate of 1,000:1.\n\n===South Vietnam===\n{{Main|South Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng}}<nowiki> </nowiki>[[File:South Vietnam 500 Dong 1966.jpg|thumb|150px]]\n\nNotes dually denominated in piastres and \u0111\u1ed3ng were issued in 1953 for the [[State of Vietnam]], which evolved into South Vietnam in 1954. On September 22, 1975, after the [[fall of Saigon]], the currency in South Vietnam was changed to a \"liberation \u0111\u1ed3ng<nowiki>''</nowiki> worth 500 old Southern \u0111\u1ed3ng.\n\n===United Vietnam===\nAfter Vietnam was reunified, the \u0111\u1ed3ng was also unified, on May 3, 1978. One new \u0111\u1ed3ng equalled one Northern \u0111\u1ed3ng or 0.8 Southern \"liberation\" \u0111\u1ed3ng.\n\nOn September 14, 1985, the \u0111\u1ed3ng was revalued, with the new \u0111\u1ed3ng worth 10 old \u0111\u1ed3ng. This started a cycle of [[chronic inflation]] that continued through much of the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+vn0091) |title=LOC Country Study Vietnam. |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref>\n\n==Coins==\n\nFor the earlier modern Vietnamese coins, please see [[North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng]] or [[South Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng]].\n\n===First \u0111\u1ed3ng===\nIn 1978, aluminium coins (dated 1976), were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, and 5 h\u00e0o and 1 \u0111\u1ed3ng. The coins were minted by the Berlin mint in the [[German Democratic Republic]] and bear the state crest on the obverse and denomination on the reverse. Due to [[chronic inflation]], these coins lost all their relevant value and no coins circulated for many years after this series.\n\n===Second \u0111\u1ed3ng===\n\n====Commemorative Issues====\n\nCommemorative coins in copper, brass, copper-nickel, silver, and gold have been issued since 1986, but none of these have ever been used in circulation.\n\n====2003 Issue====\nThe State Bank of Vietnam resumed issuing coins on December 17, 2003.<ref name=\"official spec\"/>  The new coins, minted by the Mint of Finland, were in denominations of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000 \u0111\u1ed3ng in either nickel-clad steel or brass-clad steel. Prior to its reintroduction, Vietnamese consumers had to exchange banknotes for tokens with a clerk before purchasing goods from vending machines. This was also to help the state ease the cost of producing large quantities of small denomination banknotes which tended to wear hard after every transaction. Many residents expressed excitement at seeing coins reappear after many years, as well as concern for the limited usefulness of the 200 \u0111\u1ed3ng coins due to ongoing inflationary pressures.<ref name=\"Curious Vietnamese sneak a peek at no-tear notes, coins\"/>\n\nSince the launch of the 2003 coin series, the State Bank has had some difficulties with making the acceptance of coins universal despite the partial discontinuation of smaller notes, to the point of some banks refusing coin cash deposits or the cashing in of large numbers of coins. This has prompted laws requiring private and municipal banks to transact and offer services for coins and the full discontinuation of small denomination and cotton based notes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!colspan=11| 2003 Series<ref name=\"official spec\"/>\n|-\n!rowspan=2| Image !!rowspan=2| Value !!colspan=4| Technical parameters !!colspan=3| Description !!colspan=2| Date of\n|-\n!

Since 2012 the use of coins has decreased greatly, and since 2014 coins are generally not accepted in retail, but will still be accepted in some, but not all, banks.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \u0111\u1ed3ng is from the term ''\u0111\u1ed3ng ti\u1ec1n'' (\"money\"), a loanword from the Chinese ''t\u00f3ng qi\u00e1n'' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: \u9285\u9322; [[Simplified Chinese]]: \u94dc\u94b1). The term refers to [[Cash (Chinese coin)|Chinese bronze coins]] used as currency during the dynastic periods of China and Vietnam.\nThe term ''h\u00e0o'' is a loanword from the Chinese ''h\u00e1o'' (Chinese: \u6beb), meaning a tenth of a currency unit.\nThe term ''xu'' comes from French ''sous'' meaning \"penny\".  \nThe sign is encoded {{unichar|20AB|DONG SIGN|html=}}.\n\n==History==\n===North Vietnam===<!-- This section is linked from [[North Vietnam]] -->\n{{Main|North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng}}\n\nIn 1946, the [[Viet Minh]] government (later to become the government of North Vietnam) introduced its own currency, the \u0111\u1ed3ng, to replace the [[French Indochinese piastre]] at [[par value|par]]. Two revaluations followed, in 1951 and 1959; the first was at a rate of 100:1, the second at a rate of 1,000:1.\n\n===South Vietnam===\n{{Main|South Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng}}<nowiki> </nowiki>[[File:South Vietnam 500 Dong 1966.jpg|thumb|150px]]\n\nNotes dually denominated in piastres and \u0111\u1ed3ng were issued in 1953 for the [[State of Vietnam]], which evolved into South Vietnam in 1954. On September 22, 1975, after the [[fall of Saigon]], the currency in South Vietnam was changed to a \"liberation \u0111\u1ed3ng<nowiki>''</nowiki> worth 500 old Southern \u0111\u1ed3ng.\n\n===United Vietnam===\nAfter Vietnam was reunified, the \u0111\u1ed3ng was also unified, on May 3, 1978. One new \u0111\u1ed3ng equalled one Northern \u0111\u1ed3ng or 0.8 Southern \"liberation\" \u0111\u1ed3ng.\n\nOn September 14, 1985, the \u0111\u1ed3ng was revalued, with the new \u0111\u1ed3ng worth 10 old \u0111\u1ed3ng. This started a cycle of [[chronic inflation]] that continued through much of the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+vn0091) |title=LOC Country Study Vietnam. |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref>\n\n==Coins==\n\nFor the earlier modern Vietnamese coins, please see [[North Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng]] or [[South Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng]].\n\n===First \u0111\u1ed3ng===\nIn 1978, aluminium coins (dated 1976), were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, and 5 h\u00e0o and 1 \u0111\u1ed3ng. The coins were minted by the Berlin mint in the [[German Democratic Republic]] and bear the state crest on the obverse and denomination on the reverse. Due to [[chronic inflation]], these coins lost all their relevant value and no coins circulated for many years after this series.\n\n===Second \u0111\u1ed3ng===\n\n====Commemorative Issues====\n\nCommemorative coins in copper, brass, copper-nickel, silver, and gold have been issued since 1986, but none of these have ever been used in circulation.\n\n====2003 Issue====\nThe State Bank of Vietnam resumed issuing coins on December 17, 2003.<ref name=\"official spec\"/>  The new coins, minted by the Mint of Finland, were in denominations of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000 \u0111\u1ed3ng in either nickel-clad steel or brass-clad steel. Prior to its reintroduction, Vietnamese consumers had to exchange banknotes for tokens with a clerk before purchasing goods from vending machines. This was also to help the state ease the cost of producing large quantities of small denomination banknotes which tended to wear hard after every transaction. Many residents expressed excitement at seeing coins reappear after many years, as well as concern for the limited usefulness of the 200 \u0111\u1ed3ng coins due to ongoing inflationary pressures.<ref name=\"Curious Vietnamese sneak a peek at no-tear notes, coins\"/>\n\nSince the launch of the 2003 coin series, the State Bank has had some difficulties with making the acceptance of coins universal despite the partial discontinuation of smaller notes, to the point of some banks refusing coin cash deposits or the cashing in of large numbers of coins. This has prompted laws requiring private and municipal banks to transact and offer services for coins and the full discontinuation of small denomination and cotton based notes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!colspan=11| 2003 Series<ref name=\"official spec\"/>\n|-\n!rowspan=2| Image !!rowspan=2| Value !!colspan=4| Technical parameters !!colspan=3| Description !!colspan=2| Date of\n|-\n!

H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh made a compromise with their general, [[Lu Han (general)|Lu Han]], to dissolve the Communist Party and to hold an election which would yield a coalition government. When Chiang forced the French to give the [[Shanghai French Concession|French concessions]] in Shanghai back to China in exchange for withdrawing from northern Indochina, he had no choice but to sign an agreement with France on 6 March 1946 in which Vietnam would be recognized as an autonomous state in the Indochinese Federation and the [[French Union]]. The agreement soon broke down. The purpose of the agreement, for both the French and Vietminh, was for Chiang's army to leave North Vietnam. Fighting broke out in the North soon after the Chinese left.\n\nHistorian Professor Liam Kelley of the University of Hawaii at Manoa on his ''Le Minh Khai's SEAsian History Blog'' challenged the authenticity of the alleged quote where H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh said he \"would rather smell French shit for five years than eat Chinese shit for a thousand,\" noting that Stanley Karnow provided no source for the extended quote attributed to him in his 1983 ''Vietnam: A History'' and that the original quote was most likely forged by the Frenchman Paul Mus in his 1952 book ''Vietnam: Sociologie d'une Guerre''. Mus was a supporter of French colonialism in Vietnam and H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh believed there was no danger of Chinese troops staying in Vietnam (although this was the time when China invaded Tibet). The Vietnamese at the time were busy spreading anti-French propaganda as evidence of French atrocities in Vietnam emerged while H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh showed no qualms about accepting Chinese aid after 1949.<ref>https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/ho-chi-minh-said-what/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203221545/https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2012/09/01/ho-chi-minh-said-what/ |date=3 February 2016 }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20141014090118/http://manoa.hawaii.edu/history/node/44 proof that he runs the blog]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/chiang-kai-shek-and-vietnam-in-1945/|title=Chiang Kai-shek and Vietnam in 1945|date=25 April 2013|access-date=2 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313074939/https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/chiang-kai-shek-and-vietnam-in-1945/|archive-date=13 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Giap-Ho.jpg|thumb|upright|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh (right) with [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] (left) in Hanoi, 1945]]\nThe Vi\u1ec7t Minh then collaborated with French colonial forces to massacre supporters of the Vietnamese nationalist movements in 1945\u20131946,<ref>{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Robert F. | title=Vietnamese Communism: Its Origins and Development | publisher=Hoover Institution Press | year=1975 | pages=57\u20139, 67\u20139, 74}} and {{cite book | chapter=Myths of the Vietnam War | title=Southeast Asian Perspectives | date=September 1972 | pages=14\u20138}}; also {{cite book | first=Arthur J. | last=Dommen | title=The Indochinese Experience of the French and the Americans | publisher=Indiana University Press | year=2001 | pages=153\u20134}}</ref> and of the Trotskyists.

In the final days of 1946, after a year of diplomatic failure and many concessions in agreements, such as the [[Da Lat|Dalat]] and [[Fontainebleau Agreements|Fontainebleau conferences]], the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] government found that war was inevitable. The bombardment of Haiphong by French forces at Hanoi only strengthened the belief that France had no intention of allowing an autonomous, independent state in Vietnam. The bombardment of Haiphong reportedly killed more than 6000 Vietnamese civilians. French forces marched into Hanoi, now the capital city of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. On 19 December 1946, after the Haiphong incident, Ho Chi Minh declared war against the [[French Union]], marking the beginning of the [[Indochina War]].<ref>[[:vi:L\u1eddi k\u00eau g\u1ecdi to\u00e0n qu\u1ed1c kh\u00e1ng chi\u1ebfn]]</ref> The [[Viet Minh|Vietnam National Army]], mostly armed with [[machete]]s and [[musket]]s immediately attacked.

When the French negotiators arrived at the meeting site, they found a mud hut with a thatched roof. Inside they found a long table with chairs. In one corner of the room, a silver ice bucket contained ice and a bottle of good champagne, indicating that Ho expected the negotiations to succeed. One demand by the French was the return to French custody of a number of Japanese military officers (who had been helping the Vietnamese armed forces by training them in the use of weapons of Japanese origin) for them to stand trial for war crimes committed during World War II. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh replied that the Japanese officers were allies and friends whom he could not betray, therefore he walked out to seven more years of war.<ref>Fall, Bernard.

During the 300 days, Di\u1ec7m and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] adviser Colonel [[Edward Lansdale]] staged a campaign to convince people to move to South Vietnam. The campaign was particularly focused on Vietnam's Catholics, who were to provide Di\u1ec7m's power base in his later years, with the use of the slogan \"God has gone south\". Between 800,000 and 1,000,000&nbsp;people migrated to the South, mostly Catholics.

First, this decree was issued in 1953 for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns (or waves) that followed during 1954\u20131956. Second, the decree was meant to apply to free areas (under the control of the Viet Minh government), not to the areas under French control that would be liberated in 1954\u20131955 and that would experience a far more violent struggle. Thus the number of 13,500 executed people seems to be a low-end estimate of the real number. This is corroborated by Edwin Moise in his recent paper \"Land Reform in North Vietnam, 1953\u20131956\" presented at the 18th Annual Conference on SE Asian Studies, Center for SE Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley (February 2001).

Moise made the case based on Hungarian reports provided by Balazs, but the document I cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate.

With his permission, the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng planned a massive [[Tet Offensive]] that would commence on 31 January 1968, with the aim of taking much of the South by force and administering a heavy blow to the American military. The offensive was executed at great cost and with heavy casualties on Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng's political branches and armed forces. The scope of the action shocked the world, which until then had been assured that the Communists were \"on the ropes\". The optimistic spin that the American military command had sustained for years was no longer credible. The bombing of Northern Vietnam and the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail was halted, and American and Vietnamese negotiators held discussions on how the war might be ended. From then on, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and his government's strategy, based on the idea of avoiding conventional warfare and facing the might of the United States Army, which would wear them down eventually while merely prolonging the conflict, would lead to eventual acceptance of Hanoi's terms materialized.\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Hochiminh and Bebet.JPG|thumb|left|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh holding his god-daughter, baby Elizabeth (Babette) Aubrac, with Elizabeth's mother, [[Lucie Aubrac|Lucie]], 1946]]\nIn addition to being a politician, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was also a writer, journalist, poet and [[polyglot]].

He had three siblings: his sister B\u1ea1ch Li\u00ean (Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Thanh), a clerk in the [[French Army]]; his brother [[Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Khi\u00eam]] (Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5t \u0110\u1ea1t), a [[geomancy|geomancer]] and [[Traditional Chinese herbs|traditional herbalist]]; and another brother (Nguy\u1ec5n Sinh Nhu\u1eadn), who died in infancy. As a young child, Cung (Ho) studied with his father before more formal classes with a scholar named Vuong Thuc Do.

His father was a Confucian scholar and teacher and later an imperial magistrate in the small remote district of Binh Khe ([[Qui Nh\u01a1n]]).

The steamer departed on 5 June 1911 and arrived in [[Marseille]], [[French Third Republic|France]] on 5 July 1911. The ship then left for [[Le Havre]] and [[Dunkirk]], returning to Marseille in mid-September. There, he applied for the French Colonial Administrative School, but his application was rejected.

First, this decree was issued in 1953 for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns (or waves) that followed during 1954\u20131956. Second, the decree was meant to apply to free areas (under the control of the Viet Minh government), not to the areas under French control that would be liberated in 1954\u20131955 and that would experience a far more violent struggle. Thus the number of 13,500 executed people seems to be a low-end estimate of the real number. This is corroborated by Edwin Moise in his recent paper \"Land Reform in North Vietnam, 1953\u20131956\" presented at the 18th Annual Conference on SE Asian Studies, Center for SE Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley (February 2001). In this paper, Moise (7\u20139) modified his earlier estimate in his 1983 book (which was 5,000) and accepted an estimate close to 15,000 executions. Moise made the case based on Hungarian reports provided by Balazs, but the document I cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate. This document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more, taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign, the unauthorized killings at the local level, and the suicides following arrest and torture (the central government bore less direct responsibility for these cases, however).}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Szalontai|first=Balazs|title=Political and Economic Crisis in North Vietnam, 1955\u201356|url=https://6931dbf1-a-017ed1b7-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/uw.edu/vietnamstudiesgroup/discussion-networking/vsg-discussion-list-archives/vsg-discussion-2011/drv-1956-decree-law/DRV%201956%20decree%20law.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cp-R3ROUQ71qMNWrYB5PoNF4zn1AbM0d-9c6MUbPPZALpDk4hyV6rybi8TdtN5P2p0RcEVIf61wGGrE3q3U0Ygk3U_7T6BkroHF5SmJZ6PDXNmifl--nYT_pHqyHfloE0_ypCwab_ZbO9refyEGpHEyRLeKw8Jy7NhKZI1x8NJ2wbO13M8HjtaXiHEzzDP-Qzu-fiwM8GUMl932SmyYS98YsvPlvYpTRyUGWD7Dj3pLiRpibd5-V8swsU9n1F6Gr3bcVYQ58utuSNoi2H-S0kEjG4C4C0y_b_UQtj4ei3h8LAzGBAOUhCMHdf1Y1V0yCm91UdjrIKgNmXOWcLed3p8U7ORhpcqPAZJp_zttHhsiWo2D7lY%3D&attredirects=0|accessdate=30 November 2017|journal=[[Cold War History (journal)|Cold War History]]|volume=5|number=4|date=November 2005|pages=395\u2013426}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Vu |first=Tuong |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZbr9iD1HZ8C&q=15%2C000#v=snippet&q=15%2C000&f=false |title=Paths to Development in Asia: South Korea, Vietnam, China, and Indonesia |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=9781139489010 |p=103 |quote=Clearly Vietnamese socialism followed a moderate path relative to China.

With his permission, the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng planned a massive [[Tet Offensive]] that would commence on 31 January 1968, with the aim of taking much of the South by force and administering a heavy blow to the American military. The offensive was executed at great cost and with heavy casualties on Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng's political branches and armed forces. The scope of the action shocked the world, which until then had been assured that the Communists were \"on the ropes\". The optimistic spin that the American military command had sustained for years was no longer credible. The bombing of Northern Vietnam and the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh trail was halted, and American and Vietnamese negotiators held discussions on how the war might be ended. From then on, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and his government's strategy, based on the idea of avoiding conventional warfare and facing the might of the United States Army, which would wear them down eventually while merely prolonging the conflict, would lead to eventual acceptance of Hanoi's terms materialized.\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Hochiminh and Bebet.JPG|thumb|left|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh holding his god-daughter, baby Elizabeth (Babette) Aubrac, with Elizabeth's mother, [[Lucie Aubrac|Lucie]], 1946]]\nIn addition to being a politician, H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh was also a writer, journalist, poet and [[polyglot]].

As in China, leading party cadres were \"most likely to be intellectuals descended [like Ho Chi Minh] from rural scholar-gentry families\" in the interior (the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin). Conversely, the pioneers of constitutional nationalism tended to be from the more \"Westernised\" coastal south (Saigon and surrounding French direct-rule [[Cochinchina]]) and to be from \"commercial families without a traditional Confucian background\".<ref>Duiker (1982), p. 25</ref>\n\n[[File:TTHCM.JPG|thumb|left|Shrine devoted to H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh]]\nIn Vietnam, as in China, Communism presented itself as a root and branch rejection of [[Confucianism]], condemned for its ritualism, inherent conservatism and resistance to change. Once in power, the Vietnamese Communists may not have fought Confucianism \"as bitterly as did their Chinese counterparts\", but its social prestige was \"essentially destroyed.\" In the political sphere, the puppet son of heaven (which had been weakly represented by the [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]]) was replaced by the people's republic. Orthodox materialism accorded no place to heaven, gods, or other supernatural forces. Socialist collectivism undermined the tradition of the Confucian family leader (''gia truong'').

Today H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh as the Jade Emperor is supposed to speak from the spirit world through Spiritualist mediums.
