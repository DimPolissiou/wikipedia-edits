{"title_page": "Carpatho-Rusyn Society", "text_new": "[[File:Large Rusyn emblem.jpg|thumb|Symbol of C-RS with motto 'manifesting Rusyn culture and history']]\nThe '''Carpatho-Rusyn Society''' ('''C-RS''') is a non-profit cultural organization located in the United States dedicated to promoting [[Rusyns|Carpatho-Rusyn]] culture and history. The world\u2019s largest exclusively cultural Carpatho-Rusyn organization, C-RS was established in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1994 and has over 1,250 members worldwide. \n\nThe Carpatho-Rusyns are a distinct [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] ethnicity who have lived for more than a thousand years in remote villages scattered along the foothills and valleys of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] of East Central Europe (present day [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Romania]] as well as [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]]). The name [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] identifies them as descendants, in part, of a people from the vast lands of ancient [[Rus']] who were converted to the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian Church]] in the 9th century. \n\nC-RS works to educate those of Rusyn descent as well as others about Carpatho-Rusyn heritage. \u00a0The society supports the preservation and development of Rusyn culture on both sides of the Atlantic. \n\n'''''I. Establishment'''''\n\nThe impetus for development of C-RS emanated from the Second World Congress of Rusyns held in [[Krynica-Zdr\u00f3j|Krynica]], Poland in 1993. The new society built upon the inclusive approaches of other American Carpatho-Rusyn organizations, particularly the Carpatho-Rusyn Research Center founded in 1978 by [[Paul Robert Magocsi]] and the Rusin Association founded by Larry Goga in 1983.\n\nFormed by largely third and fourth-generation Carpatho-Rusyn Americans, C-RS was dedicated to helping others discover their Carpatho-Rusyn heritage at a time when the designation \u2018Carpatho-Rusyn\u2019 was not widely known. Honoring a resilient, stateless people whose homeland changed hands repeatedly over the past centuries, C-RS sought to tell the remarkable story of \u2018a people from nowhere\u2019 \u2013 a proverbial phrase coined by the famous American artist of Carpatho-Rusyn ancestry, [[Andy Warhol]].\n\nThe society\u2019s logo prominently features the Carpatho-Rusyn national emblem as its symbol, a red bear facing blue and gold stripes with the motto \u201cmanifesting Rusyn culture and history\u201d. This shield was first adopted as the official emblem of the Czechoslovak province of [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Subcarpathian Rus\u2019]] on March 30, 1920. It fell into disuse after [[Nazi Germany]]\u2019s dismembering of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1938 but was adopted later as the official symbol of the [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Transcarpathian oblast]] of Ukraine on December 18, 1990. The emblem\u2019s left field is divided into 7 horizontal blue and gold alternating stripes representing the seven largest rivers of the land: the [[Tisza|Tysa]], [[Teresva (river)|Teresva]], [[Tereblia (river)|Tereblya]], [[Rika (river)|Rika]], [[Borzhava]], [[Latorica|Latoryca]] and [[Uzh River|Uzh]]. The silver background represents the rich salt mines of the area and the red bear is depicted as the king of the snowy Carpathian Mountains. \n\n'''''II. Early Years'''''\n\nThe society expanded rapidly from its eight original founders. This growth necessitated a newsletter for its members, [[New Rusyn Times|''The New Rusyn Times'']]''.'' In addition to promoting self-awareness of Carpatho-Rusyn identity, the mission of C-RS \u2018holds in high esteem the continuity of life which connects the living Rusyn culture to its treasured and ancient heritage\u2019. Through its growing membership, the society promoted opportunities to learn, express, and enjoy the beauty and life affirming values of a living Carpatho-Rusyn heritage.\n[[File:Carpatho-Rusyn Folk exhibit.jpg|thumb|Carpatho-Rusyn Folk Exhibit]]\nC-RS has hosted conferences on Carpatho-Rusyn history and genealogy and has managed the Carpatho-Rusyn cultural display at the [[Pittsburgh Folk Festival]]. The society co-sponsored a national Carpatho-Rusyn cultural celebration at the [[The Andy Warhol Museum|Andy Warhol Museum]] in Pittsburgh and provides traveling displays of Rusyn culture for church and ethnic festivals.\n\nOne of C-RS\u2019s greatest early successes was in reestablishing relations with the European Carpatho-Rusyn community and supporting their efforts to resurrect and develop Carpatho-Rusyn culture after fifty years of [[Communism|Communist]] persecution. The society has two European funds \u2013 Humanitarian Aid and the Rusyn Homeland Fund.\n[[File:CRS Exhibition of Rusyn Art.jpg|thumb|C-RS exhibition of Carpatho-Rusyn Art]]\nThe Humanitarian Aid Fund was created in 1996 when Carpatho-Rusyn villages in the Transcarpathian oblast of Ukraine experienced an unexpected late fall flood killing 17 and leaving hundreds homeless. Through its members, C-RS worked with the [[American Red Cross]] to set up relief for the people of Subcarpathian Rus\u2019. \u00a0Since then the fund sends primarily medical supplies to healthcare professionals in Transcarpathia for those in need.\n\nThe society\u2019s Rusyn Homeland Fund provided comprehensive support to the Carpatho-Rusyn community in eastern Slovakia at a critical time before the 2001 census to heighten ethnic awareness of those of Carpatho-Rusyn heritage. The fund underwrote the printing of maps showing Carpatho-Rusyn villages, a traveling display of Carpatho-Rusyn culture, and the widespread mailing of Rusyn-language newspapers and magazines to Carpatho-Rusyn households. Consequently, the number of Slovak citizens identifying as Carpatho-Rusyn increased dramatically compared with the previous census of 1991. The fund also provided financial support to help create a network of Rusyn language schools in [[Transcarpathia]], Ukraine.\n\n'''''III. Moving Forward'''''\n\nThe founding president of C-RS was John Righetti who served until 2012 and is now president emeritus. He was succeeded by Jim Kepchar-Kaminski (2013-2015) and Maryann Sivak (2015-present). The organization currently consists of 6 chapters and 8 branches located throughout the United States. \n\nC-RS seeks to collaborate with all Carpatho-Rusyn organizations worldwide to disseminate historical, genealogical, linguistic and ethno-cultural information. In addition to its newsletter, the society created a website, blog and e-mail bulletin, C-RS Connection. Since 2004, the Carpatho-Rusyn Society Heritage Program has broadcast Carpatho-Rusyn music and information on [[WPIT]] in the greater Pittsburgh area and worldwide via the web. The society currently hosts a genealogy forum on its website and is expanding its social media presence\n\nPrograms that have served both the Carpatho-Rusyn American and European communities include the highly successful Rusyn Heritage Tour. The society has promoted an annual two- week tour of the Carpatho-Rusyn communities in Poland, Slovakia and Ukraine. The tour experience is one of immersion in contemporary Rusyn culture as well as allowing for visits to ancestral villages and genealogical research. Since 2011, C-RS has supported and offered scholarships to the Studium Carpato-Ruthenorum, an annual international summer school for Rusyn language and culture held at [[University of Pre\u0161ov|Presov University]].\n\n'''''IV. National Cultural Center'''''\n[[File:Cultural center jpg.jpg|thumb|Carpatho-Rusyn Cultural and Educational Center, Munhall, PA]]\nIn 2004, C-RS purchased the former [[St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cathedral (Pittsburgh)#The%20first%20cathedral%2C%201903|St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cathedral]] at 915 Dickson Street in [[Munhall, Pennsylvania]] and converted it into the Carpatho-Rusyn Cultural and Educational Center. The century-old building holds significance for those of Carpatho-Rusyn heritage. It was designed in 1903 by Hungarian-born architect [[Titus de Bobula]] and was patterned after the Carpatho-Rusyn [[Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] Cathedral of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross in [[Uzhhorod]] (Ungvar, [[Kingdom of Hungary]] at the time). In 1929, the building was chosen as the cathedral for the Ruthenian (Rusyn) Greek Catholic Exarchate in America.\n[[File:Slavjane Folk Ensemble performing at C-RS 25th Anniversary.jpg|thumb|Slavjane Folk Ensemble performance at C-RS 25th Anniversary celebration]]\nIn May 2019, the society celebrated its 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary at its renovated cultural center. Professor [[Paul Robert Magocsi]], the world\u2019s foremost authority on Carpatho-Rusyns, gave the keynote address and received the society\u2019s highest honor, the [[Michael Strank]] Award, named after the Carpatho-Rusyn-American Marine sergeant who helped raise the US flag at the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]]. A native of Orjabyna ([[Jarabina]]), Czechoslovakia, Strank was awarded US citizenship posthumously in 2008. Prior recipients of the Michael Strank Award were Orestes Mihaly (2009) and John Righetti (2014).\n\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Oleksandr Dukhnovych|Alexander Dukhnovych]]\n*[[Gregory \u017datkovich|Gregory Zatkovich]]\n*[[Rusyn Americans]]\n*[[List of Rusyn Americans|List of Rusyn-Americans]]\n*[[Ruthenia]]\n*[[Lemkos]]\n*[[Boykos]]\n*[[Hutsuls]]\n*[[Pannonian Rusyns|Pannonian Rusyn]]\n*[[Union of Uzhhorod]]\n*[[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Greek Catholic]]\n*[[American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese]]\n*[[Greek Catholic Union of the USA|Greek Catholic Union]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.c-rs.org}}\n*[https://c-rsmedia.org Carpatho-Rusyn Media Outlet] \n*[https://wpitradio.com/radioshow/3335 Carpatho-Rusyn Heritage Radio Program] \n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THl3Y9u99S8&feature=youtu.be C-RS YouTube Channel]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/CarpathoRusynSociety/ C-RS Facebook Page]\n*[https://instagram.com/carpathorusynsociety?igshid=a6wsggqu3fhq C-RS Instagram]\n*[https://www.c-rrc.org Carpatho-Rusyn Research Center]\n*[http://www.rusinmn.org Rusin Association]\n\n{{Pittsburgh}}\n\n[[Category:1994 establishments in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Clubs and societies in the United States]]\n[[Category:Culture of Pittsburgh]]\n[[Category:Ethnic fraternal orders in the United States]]\n[[Category:European-American culture in Pittsburgh]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in Pittsburgh]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1994]]\n[[Category:Rusyn-American culture in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Rusyn-American history]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Large Rusyn emblem.jpg|thumb|Symbol of C-RS with motto 'manifesting Rusyn culture and history']]\nThe '''Carpatho-Rusyn Society''' ('''C-RS''') is a non-profit cultural organization located in the United States dedicated to promoting [[Rusyns|Carpatho-Rusyn]] culture and history.

On 21 March, during the [[Battle of Alexandria]], French cavalry broke through the British lines, formed up behind the regiment, and began to charge. Still heavily engaged to their front, the order was given \"Rear Rank, 28th! Right About Face\", and standing thus in two ranks, back to back, the regiment successfully defended itself. After the battle, the regiment began wearing a badge on the back as well as the front of the headdress to commemorate their action, a unique distinction in the British Army which was officially sanctioned in 1830.<ref>Daniell pp.69-75</ref><ref name=Grazebrook>Grazebrook pp. 112\u2013113</ref>{{efn|The origins of the back badge and its initial form are not known; other than the honour \"Egypt\", awarded to all units, there is no record of a special badge being officially granted. An officer who served with the regiment between 1805 and 1807 wrote that the regiment \"acquired the emblem of the double front.\" In 1815, a staff officer witnessed the regiment marching out to Quatre Bras \"having their number both in front and rear of their low caps\u2014a memorial of Egypt.\" The first record of official recognition appears in an 1830 letter from the Horse Guards, which states that \"it was never the intention to deprive the 28th Regiment of any badge of honour they may have acquired by their distinguished service in Egypt, and that there will be no objection to their retaining the plate they have been accustomed to wear on the back of their caps since that service...\" This was officially confirmed in another letter dated 1843.

Still heavily engaged to their front, the order was given \"Rear Rank, 28th! Right About Face\", and standing thus in two ranks, back to back, the regiment successfully defended itself.
