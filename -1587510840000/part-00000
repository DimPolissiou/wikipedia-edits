Its production method was continuously refined to meet the needs of the Eastern Front, making the T-34 quicker and cheaper to produce. The Soviets ultimately built over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded despite the loss of tens of thousands in combat against the German [[Wehrmacht]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The T-34 in WWII: the Legend vs. the Performance {{!}} Operation Barbarrosa|url=http://www.operationbarbarossa.net/the-t-34-in-wwii-the-legend-vs-the-performance/#Conclusions%2520Regarding%20the%20T-34%E2%80%99s%20Overall%20Performance%20as%20a%20%E2%80%98War%20Winner%E2%80%99|website=www.operationbarbarossa.net|accessdate=2015-12-16}}</ref> Replacing many [[light tank|light]] and [[medium tank]]s in [[Red Army]] service, it was the most-produced tank of the war, as well as the second most-produced tank of all time (after its successor, the [[T-54/55]] series).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Reference-Harrison-2002|Harrison 2002]]</ref> With 44,900 lost during the war, it also suffered the most tank losses ever.<ref name=\"Kirosheev 253\">{{cite book|first=G.

The T-26 was slow-moving, designed to keep pace with infantry on the ground. The BT tanks were [[cavalry tank]]s: fast-moving and light, designed for maneuver warfare. Both were Soviet developments of foreign designs from the early 1930s; the T-26 was based on the British [[Vickers 6-Ton]], and the BT tanks were based on a design from American engineer [[J. Walter Christie]].<ref>Sale, Richard.

The [[prototype]] tank, designated A-20, was specified with {{cvt|20|mm|in|1}} of [[vehicle armour|armour]], a 45&nbsp;mm (1.77&nbsp;in) gun, and the new [[Diesel model V-2|Model V-2-34]] engine, using less-flammable diesel fuel in a [[V12 engine|V12]] configuration designed by [[Chelpan Konstantin Fyodorovich|Konstantin Chelpan]]. It also had an 8\u00d76-wheel convertible drive similar to the BT tank's 8\u00d72, which allowed it to run on wheels without [[caterpillar track]]s.<ref>[[#Reference-Zheltov-1999|Zheltov 1999]]</ref> This feature had greatly saved on maintenance and repair of the unreliable tank tracks of the early 1930s, and allowed tanks to exceed {{convert|85|km/h}} on roads, but gave no advantage in combat and its complexity made it difficult to maintain. By 1937\u201338, track design had improved and the designers considered it a waste of space, weight, and maintenance resources, despite the road speed advantage.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:66, 111]]</ref> The A-20 also incorporated previous research (BT-IS and BT-SW-2 projects) into [[sloped armour]]: its all-round sloped armour plates were more likely to deflect rounds than perpendicular armour.<ref>Yaziv, D.; Chocron, S.; Anderson, Jr., C.E.; Grosch, D.J. \"Oblique Penetration in Ceramic Targets\". ''Proceedings of the 19th International Symposium on Ballistics IBS 2001'', Interlaken, Switzerland: 1257\u201364</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Lake Khasan]] in July 1938 and the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]] in 1939, an undeclared border war with [[Japan]] on the frontier with occupied [[Manchuria]], the Soviets deployed numerous tanks against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA). Although the IJA [[Type 95 Ha-Go]] light tanks had [[diesel engine]]s,<ref>{{harvnb|Zaloga|2007|pp=}}</ref> the Red Army's T-26 and BT tanks used petrol engines which, while common in tank designs of the time, often burst into flames when hit by IJA tank-killer teams<ref>[[#Reference-Coox|Coox 1990:311]]</ref> using [[Molotov cocktail]]s. Poor quality welds in the Soviet armour plates left small gaps between them, and flaming petrol from the Molotov cocktails easily seeped into the fighting and engine compartment; portions of the armour plating that had been assembled with [[rivet]]s also proved to be vulnerable.<ref>[[#Reference-Coox|Coox 1990:309]]</ref> The Soviet tanks were also easily destroyed by the Japanese Type 95 tank's 37&nbsp;mm gunfire, despite the low velocity of that gun,<ref>[[#Reference-Coox|Coox 1990:437, 993]]</ref> or \"at any other slightest provocation\".<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:111]]</ref> The use of riveted armour led to a problem whereby the impact of enemy shells, even if they failed to disable the tank or kill the crew on their own, would cause the rivets to break off and become projectiles inside the tank.\n\n[[File:Medium tank A-32.jpg|thumbnail|Medium tank A-32]]\nAfter these battles, Koshkin convinced Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] to let him develop a second prototype, a more heavily armed and armoured \"universal tank\" that reflected the lessons learned and could replace both the T-26 and the BT tanks. Koshkin named the second prototype A-32, after its {{cvt|32|mm|in|1}} of frontal armour. It had an L-10 76.2&nbsp;mm (3&nbsp;in) gun, and the same Model V-2-34 diesel.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Both were tested in [[quality control|field trials]] at [[Kubinka]] in 1939, with the heavier A-32 proving to be as mobile as the A-20.

Alexander Morozov personally supervised the evacuation of all skilled engineers and laborers, machinery and stock from KhPZ to re-establish the factory at the site of the [[Uralvagonzavod|Dzerzhinsky Ural Railcar Factory]] in [[Nizhny Tagil]], renamed Stalin Ural Tank Factory N.183.<ref name=\"auto1\">[[#Reference-Zaloga-1983|Zaloga & Grandsen 1983:17]]</ref> The Kirovsky Factory, evacuated just weeks before the Germans surrounded Leningrad, moved with the Kharkov Diesel Factory to the [[Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant|Stalin Tractor Factory]] in [[Chelyabinsk]], soon to be nicknamed ''Tankograd'' (\"Tank City\"). The workers and machinery from Leningrad's Voroshilov Tank Factory N.174 were incorporated into the Ural Factory and the new Omsk Factory N.174. The [[Uralmash|Ordzhonikidze Ural Heavy Machine Tool Works]] (UZTM) in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] absorbed workers and machines from several small machine shops in the path of German forces.\n\nWhile these factories were being rapidly moved, the industrial complex surrounding the [[Volgograd Tractor Factory|Dzerzhinsky Tractor Factory]] in Stalingrad continued to work double shifts throughout the period of withdrawal (September 1941 to September 1942) to make up for production lost, and produced 40% of all T-34s during the period.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1983|Zaloga & Grandsen 1983:13]]</ref> As the factory became surrounded by heavy fighting in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1942, the situation there grew desperate: manufacturing innovations were necessitated by material shortages, and stories persist of unpainted T-34 tanks driven out of the factory directly to the battlefields around it.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1994|Zaloga & Sarson 1994:23]]</ref> Stalingrad kept up production until September 1942.\n\nSoviet designers were aware of design deficiencies in the tank, but most of the desired remedies would have slowed tank production and so were not implemented: the only changes allowed on the production lines through to 1944 were those to make production simpler and cheaper.

Both tanks were the backbone of the armoured units in their respective armies, both nations distributed these tanks to their allies, who also used them as the mainstay of their own armoured formations, and both were upgraded extensively and fitted with more powerful guns. Both were designed for mobility and ease of manufacture and maintenance, sacrificing some performance for these goals. Both chassis were used as the foundation for a variety of support vehicles, such as armour recovery vehicles, [[tank destroyer]]s, and self-propelled artillery. Both were an approximately even match for the standard German medium tank, the [[Panzer IV]], though each of these three tanks had particular advantages and weaknesses compared with the other two. Neither the T-34 nor the M4 was a match for Germany's heavier tanks, the [[Panther tank|Panther]] (technically a medium tank) or the [[Tiger I]]; the Soviets used the [[IS-2 heavy tank]] and the U.S. used the [[M26 Pershing]] as the heavy tanks of their forces instead.<ref>Zaloga & Grandsen 1983:37</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" summary=\"Characteristics and production cost of the main models of T-34, T-34-85 and T-44\"\n|+ Soviet medium tank models of World War II<ref name=\"Zaloga 2006\">[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga & Grandsen (1984:113, 184)]], [[#Reference-Harrison-2002|Harrison (2002:181)]], [[#Reference-KMDB-2006|KMDB (2006)]].</ref>\n|-\n!

This model, with its [[85 mm air defense gun M1939 (52-K)|85&nbsp;mm]] (3.35&nbsp;in) ZiS gun, provided greatly increased firepower compared to the previous T-34's 76.2mm gun. The 85&nbsp;mm gun could penetrate the turret front of a [[Tiger I]] tank from {{cvt|500|m|yd}} and the driver's front plate from {{cvt|300|m|yd}} at the side angle of 30 degrees, and the larger turret enabled the addition of another crew member, allowing the roles of commander and gunner to be separated and increasing the rate of fire and overall effectiveness.<ref name=\"Jentz and Doyle 1993:19\u201320\">Jentz and Doyle 1993:20.</ref> Against the frontal armour of the [[Panther tank|Panther]] at 30 degrees sidewards, the T-34-85 could not penetrate the non-[[Gun mantlet|mantlet]] of its turret at {{cvt|500|m|yd}},<ref name=\"Jentz 1995:128\" /> meaning that even upgraded models of the T-34 usually needed tungsten rounds or had to flank a Panther to destroy it.<ref>Healy 2008:167\u2013172</ref><!--sentence doesn't make sense-->{{clarify|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe greater length of the 85&nbsp;mm gun barrel (4.645 meters) made it necessary for crews to be careful not to plow it into the ground on bumpy roads or in combat. Tank commander A.K. Rodkin commented: \"the tank could have dug the ground with it in the smallest ditch [filling the barrel with dirt]. If you fired it after that, the barrel would open up at the end like the petals of a flower\", destroying the barrel.

In addition, its pneumatic engine starting system, fed from a compressed air cylinder mounted inside the tank's bow, remained reliable even in the coldest conditions. The Panzer IV, its closest German equivalent at that time, used narrower track which tended to sink in such conditions.<ref>Perrett 1999</ref><sup>[more specific citation needed]</sup>\n\n===Ergonomics===\nThe original 76mm armed T-34 suffered from the unsatisfactory ergonomic layout of its crew compartment compared to the later 85mm variant. The two-man [[gun turret|turret]] crew arrangement required the commander to aim and fire the gun, an arrangement common to most Soviet tanks of the day. The two-man turret was \"cramped and inefficient\"{{sfn|Hughes|Mann|2002|p=63}} and was inferior to the three-man (commander, gunner, and loader) turret crews of German Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks. The Germans noted the T-34 was very slow to find and engage targets while the Panzers could typically get off three rounds for every one fired by the T-34.<ref name=\"Zaloga-1994-40\" />\n\nEarly in the war, the commander fought at a further disadvantage; the forward-opening [[trapdoor|hatch]] and the lack of a turret cupola forced him to observe the battlefield through a single vision slit and traversable [[periscope]].<ref>Zaloga, p. 39</ref> German commanders liked to fight \"heads-up\", with their seat raised and having a full field of view \u2013 in the T-34 this was impossible.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:135\u20137]]</ref> Soviet veterans condemned the turret hatches of the early models. Nicknamed ''[[pirozhok]]'' (stuffed bun) because of its characteristic shape, it was heavy and hard to open. The complaints of the crews urged the design group led by Alexander Morozov to switch in August 1942<ref>http://english.battlefield.ru/t-34.html</ref> to using two hatches in the turret.<ref>[[#Reference-Drabkin|Drabkin & Sheremet 2006:27-28]]</ref>\n\nThe loader also had a difficult job due to the lack of a turret basket (a rotating floor that moves as the turret turns); the same fault was present on all German tanks prior to the Panzer IV. The floor under the T-34's turret was made up of ammunition stored in small metal boxes, covered by a rubber mat. There were nine ready rounds of ammunition stowed in racks on the sides of the fighting compartment. Once these rounds had been used, the crew had to pull additional ammunition out of the floor boxes, leaving the floor littered with open bins and matting and reducing their performance.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:137]]</ref>\n\n{{quotation|The main weakness [of the two-man turret of a T-34 Model 1941] is that it is very tight.

The motor is weak, very overloaded and sparks horribly, as a result of which the device regulating the speed of the rotation burns out, and the teeth of the cogwheels break into pieces. They recommend replacing it with a hydraulic or simply manual system.<ref name=\"Aberdeen\" />}}\n\nMost of the problems created by the cramped T-34/76 turret, known before the war, were corrected with the provision of a bigger cast three-man turret{{sfn|Hughes|Mann|2002|p=61,63}} on the T-34-85 in 1944.\n\n===General reliability===\nThe T-34's wide track and good suspension gave it excellent cross-country performance. Early in the tank's life, however, this advantage was greatly reduced by the numerous teething troubles the design displayed: a long road trip could be a lethal exercise for a T-34 tank at the start of the war. When in June 1941, the [[8th Mechanised Corps]] of [[D.I. Ryabyshev]] marched towards Dubno, the corps lost half of its vehicles. A.V. Bodnar, who was in combat in 1941\u201342, recalled:\n\n{{quotation|From the point of view of operating them, the German armored machines were almost perfect, they broke down less often. For the Germans, covering 200&nbsp;km was nothing, but with T-34s something would have been lost, something would have broken down.

The examinations, performed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, highlighted these early faults, which were in turn acknowledged in a 1942 Soviet report on the results of the testing:\n\n{{quotation|The Christie's suspension was tested a long time ago by the Americans and unconditionally rejected.

The turret drive also suffered from poor reliability. The use of poorly machined, low quality steel side friction clutches and the T-34's outdated and poorly manufactured transmission meant frequent mechanical failure occurred and that they \"create an inhuman harshness for the driver\". A lack of properly installed and shielded radios \u2013 if they existed at all \u2013 restricted their operational range to under {{cvt|16|km}}.<ref name=\"Aberdeen\" />\n\n{{quotation|Judging by samples, Russians when producing tanks pay little attention to careful machining or the finishing and technology of small parts and components, which leads to the loss of the advantage what would otherwise accrue from what on the whole are well-designed tanks.

Larger numbers of the [[88mm flak gun|88&nbsp;mm ''Flak'']] guns also arrived, which could easily defeat a T-34 at very long ranges, though their size and general unwieldiness meant that they were often difficult to move into position in the rough Soviet terrain.<ref>Gander and Chamberlain, 1979:119</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the Soviets incrementally upgraded the T-34. The Model 1942 featured increased armour on the turret and many simplified components. The Model 1943 (confusingly also introduced in 1942) had yet more armour, as well as increased fuel capacity and more ammunition storage. Also added were an improved engine air filter and a new clutch mated to an improved and more reliable five-speed transmission.<ref name=\"Zaloga 2006\" /> Finally, the Model 1943 also had a new, slightly roomier (but still two-man) turret of a distinctive hexagonal shape that was easier to manufacture, derived from the abandoned [[T-34 variants#Tanks|T-34M]] project.<ref name=\"auto2\" />\n\nThe T-34 was essential in resisting the German summer offensive in 1942, and executing the double encirclement manoeuver that cut off the German Sixth Army at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in December 1942. The Sixth Army was surrounded, and eventually surrendered in February 1943, a campaign widely regarded as the turning point of the war on the Eastern Front.\n\nIn 1943, the Soviets formed [[Polish Armed Forces in the East|Polish]] and [[I Corps (Czechoslovakia)|Czechoslovak]] armies-in-exile, and these started to receive the T-34 Model 1943 with a hexagonal turret. Like the Soviet forces themselves, the Polish and Czechoslovak tank crews were sent into action quickly with little training, and suffered high casualties.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n[[File:Zitomir 43-44.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet T-34 tanks await orders to move forward during the [[Zhitomir\u2013Berdichev Offensive]] in January 1944]]\nIn July 1943, the Germans launched [[Operation Citadel]], in the region around [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]], their last major offensive on the Eastern Front in the Second World War. It was the debut of the German [[Panther tank]], although the numbers employed at Kursk were small and the brunt of the burden was carried by the [[Panzer III]], [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III|StuG III]], and [[Panzer IV]]. The campaign featured the largest tank battles in history. The high-water mark of the battle was the massive armour engagement at [[Battle of Prokhorovka|Prokhorovka]], which began on 12 July, though the vast majority of armour losses on both sides were caused by artillery and mines, rather than tanks.<ref name=\"Prokhorovka Interview\">{{cite web|last1=Zamulin|first1=Valeriy|title=Prokhorovka Interview|url=http://worldoftanks.ru/ru/news/pc-browser/12/prokhorovka_interview_zamulin/?|website=World of Tanks|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref> Over 6,000 fully tracked armoured vehicles, 4,000 combat aircraft, and 2 million men are believed to have participated in these battles.\n\nThe Soviet high command's decision to focus on one cost-effective design, cutting costs and simplifying production wherever possible while only allowing relatively minor improvements, had proven to be an astute choice for the first two years of the war. However, the battles in the summer of 1943 demonstrated that the 76.2&nbsp;mm gun of the T-34 was no longer as effective as it was in 1941. Soviet tank crews struggled at longer ranges with the additional frontal armour applied to the later variants of the Panzer III and Panzer IV, and were unable to penetrate the frontal armour of the new German Panther or Tiger I tank at standard combat ranges without tungsten rounds, and had to rely on tactical skill through flanking maneuvers and combined arms.<ref name=\"Prokhorovka Interview\" />\n\n===T-34-85===\n[[File:P82-2l.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A T-34 Model 1942 (left), next to the [[T-43 medium tank|T-43]].]]\nAfter improved German Panzer IVs with the high-velocity [[7.5 cm KwK 40|75&nbsp;mm (2.95&nbsp;in) gun]] were encountered in combat in 1942, a project to design an entirely new Soviet tank was begun, with the goals of increasing armour protection while adding modern features like a [[torsion-bar]] suspension and a three-man turret. The new tank, the [[T-43 medium tank|T-43]], was intended to be a universal model to replace both the T-34 and the [[KV-1 (tank)|KV-1]] heavy tank. However, the T-43 prototype's armour, though heavier, was not capable against German 88&nbsp;mm guns, while its mobility was found to be inferior to the T-34. Finally, although the T-43 shared over 70% of its components with the T-34, manufacturing it would still have required a significant slow-down in production.<ref name=\"zaloga1997\">[[#Reference-Zaloga-1997|Zaloga et al. 1997:5]]</ref> Consequently, the T-43 was cancelled.\n\nNot only were the weapons of German tanks improving, so was their armour. Soviet firing tests against a captured Tiger I heavy tank in April 1943 showed that the T-34's 76&nbsp;mm gun could not penetrate the front of the Tiger I at all, and the side only at the very close range. A Soviet 85&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, the [[85 mm air defense gun M1939 (52-K)|52-K]], was found capable of doing the job, and so derivatives of it were developed for tanks.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eugene Boldyrev |url=http://www.battlefield.ru/content/view/87/43/lang,en/ |title=\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a \u0422-34-85 \u2013 The Russian Battlefield |publisher=Battlefield.ru |date=2005-09-20 |accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref><ref>Healy 2008:167\u2013171</ref> The resulting tank gun could penetrate the side armour of the Tiger I from a distance of 800 meters and the turret side from a distance of 600 meters.

Its turret ring was enlarged from 1,425&nbsp;mm (56&nbsp;in) to 1,600&nbsp;mm (63&nbsp;in), allowing a larger turret to be fitted and thus the larger 85&nbsp;mm gun. The prototype T-43's turret design was hurriedly adopted by Vyacheslav Kerichev at the [[Krasnoye Sormovo Factory]] to fit the T-34.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:166]]</ref> This was a larger three-man turret, with radio (previously in the hull) and observation cupola in the roof. Now the tank commander needed only to command (aided by cupola and radio systems), leaving the operation of the gun to the gunner and the loader. The turret armour was much thicker, 90&nbsp;mm, even if bigger and less sloped than the original T-34 turret. This made the turret, overall, a bigger target (due to the three-man crew and bigger gun), but more resistant to enemy fire. The ammunition load shrank from around 90-100 to 55-60 shells, but the projectiles were 50% heavier (9&nbsp;kg) and were much better in the anti-armour role, and reasonable in a general purpose role. The resulting new tank, the T-34-85, was seen as a compromise between advocates for the T-43 and others who wanted to continue to build as many 76&nbsp;mm-armed T-34s as possible without interruption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=63|title=T-34/85 \u2013 Medium Tank \u2013 History, Specs and Pictures \u2013 Military Tanks, Vehicles and Artillery|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:T-34-85 interior Parola Tank Museum.jpg|thumb|Interior of a T-34-85 viewed from the driver's hatch, showing the ammunition boxes on which the loader had to stand in the absence of a turret basket.

Parallel to the production of the T-34-85 with the D-5T gun, production of the T-34-85 using the S-53 gun (later to be modified and redesignated as the ZIS-S-53 gun) began in February 1944 at Factory No. 112.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Michulec |first1=Robert |title=T-34 Mythical Weapon |date=2007 |publisher=Airconnection |isbn=978-0978109103 |pages=197\u2013201 }}</ref> The improved T-34-85 became the standard Soviet medium tank, with an uninterrupted production run until the end of the war. A T-34-85 initially cost about 30 percent more to produce than a Model 1943, at 164,000 [[ruble]]s; by 1945 this had been reduced to 142,000 rubles.<ref name=\"harrison2002\">[[#Reference-Harrison-2002|Harrison 2002:181]]</ref> During the course of the [[World War II]], the cost of a T-34 tank was reduced by almost half, from 270,000 rubles in 1941,<ref name=\"harrison2002\" /> while in the meantime its top speed remained about the same, and its main gun's armour penetration and turret frontal armour thickness both nearly doubled.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga 1984:113, 184, 225]]</ref>\n\nThe T-34-85 gave the Red Army a tank with better armour and mobility than the German Panzer IV tank and StuG III assault gun. While it could not match the armour or weapons of the heavier Panther and Tiger tanks, its improved firepower made it much more effective than earlier models, and overall it was more cost-effective than the heaviest German tanks. In comparison with the T-34-85 program, the Germans instead chose an upgrade path based on the introduction of completely new, expensive, heavier, and more complex tanks, greatly slowing the growth of their tank production and aiding the Soviets in maintaining a substantial numerical superiority in tanks.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1983|Zaloga & Grandsen 1983:37]]</ref> By May 1944, T-34-85 production had reached 1,200 tanks per month.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1997|Zaloga et al. 1997:6]]</ref> In the entire war, production figures for all Panther types reached no more than 6,557, and for all Tiger types (including the Tiger I and Tiger II) 2,027.<ref>Tom Philo, \"[http://www.taphilo.com/history/WWII/Production-Figures-WWII.shtml Selected Equipment Production Figures World War II]\". at ''Tom Philo Photography'' website, retrieved on July 4, 2013</ref> Production figures for the T-34-85 alone reached 22,559.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===German use of T-34s===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-277-0836-04, Russland, erbeutete russische T-34 Panzer.jpg|thumb|Captured T-34 Model 1943 tanks pressed into service with the [[Wehrmacht]], January 1944]]\n\nThe German army often employed as much captured [[materiel]] as possible and T-34s were not an exception. Fighting on the Eastern Front saw large numbers of T-34s captured, though few were T-34-85s. These were designated by the Germans as Panzerkampfwagen T-34 747(r). From late 1941, captured T-34s were transported to a German workshop for repairs and modification to German requirements. In 1943 a local tank factory in [[Kharkov]] was used for this purpose. These were sometimes modified to German standards by the installation of a German commander's cupola and radio equipment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe first captured T-34s entered German service during the summer of 1941. In order to prevent recognition mistakes, large-dimension crosses or even swastikas were painted on the tanks, including on top of the turret, in order to prevent strikes from [[Axis powers|Axis]] aircraft. Badly damaged tanks were either dug in as pillboxes or were used for testing and training purposes.\n\n===Manchurian campaign (August 1945)===\n{{Main|Soviet invasion of Manchuria}}\n\nJust after midnight on 9 August 1945, though the terrain was believed by the Japanese to be impassable by armoured formations, the Soviet Union invaded [[Manchukuo|Japanese-occupied Manchuria]]. Red Army combined-arms forces achieved complete surprise and used a powerful, deep-penetrating attack in a classic double encirclement pattern, spearheaded by the T-34-85. The opposing Japanese forces had been reduced as elite units had been drawn off to other fronts and the remaining forces were in the middle of a redeployment. The Japanese tanks remaining to face them were all held in the rear and not used in combat; the Japanese had weak support from [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force|IJAAF]] forces, engineering, and communications. Japanese forces were overwhelmed, though some put up resistance. The Japanese emperor transmitted a surrender order on 14 August, but the [[Kwangtung Army]] was not given a formal cease-fire until 17 August.<ref name=GlobalSecurity>Marine Corps University Command and Staff College (1986) [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1986/RMF.htm \"The Soviet Army Offensive: Manchuria, 1945.\"] Global Security website.</ref>\n\n===Korean War (1950\u20131953)===\n[[File:T-34 knocked out September 1950.jpg|thumb|left|[[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] knocked out this North Korean T-34-85 in September 1950 while American and [[United Nations]] forces [[Second Battle of Seoul|advanced on]] [[Seoul]] after their successful [[Battle of Inchon|amphibious landings at Inchon]] during the [[Korean War]].

By the time the KPA were forced to withdraw from the south, about 239 T-34s and 74 [[SU-76]] assault guns had been lost or abandoned.<ref name=\"Perrett 1987:135\"/> After October 1950, KPA armour was rarely encountered.

Its general specifications remained nearly unchanged until late 1944, when it received a firepower upgrade with the introduction of the greatly improved T-34/85 variant. Its production method was continuously refined to meet the needs of the Eastern Front, making the T-34 quicker and cheaper to produce. The Soviets ultimately built over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded despite the loss of tens of thousands in combat against the German [[Wehrmacht]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The T-34 in WWII: the Legend vs. the Performance {{!}} Operation Barbarrosa|url=http://www.operationbarbarossa.net/the-t-34-in-wwii-the-legend-vs-the-performance/#Conclusions%2520Regarding%20the%20T-34%E2%80%99s%20Overall%20Performance%20as%20a%20%E2%80%98War%20Winner%E2%80%99|website=www.operationbarbarossa.net|accessdate=2015-12-16}}</ref> Replacing many [[light tank|light]] and [[medium tank]]s in [[Red Army]] service, it was the most-produced tank of the war, as well as the second most-produced tank of all time (after its successor, the [[T-54/55]] series).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Reference-Harrison-2002|Harrison 2002]]</ref> With 44,900 lost during the war, it also suffered the most tank losses ever.<ref name=\"Kirosheev 253\">{{cite book|first=G.

The T-26 was slow-moving, designed to keep pace with infantry on the ground. The BT tanks were [[cavalry tank]]s: fast-moving and light, designed for maneuver warfare. Both were Soviet developments of foreign designs from the early 1930s; the T-26 was based on the British [[Vickers 6-Ton]], and the BT tanks were based on a design from American engineer [[J. Walter Christie]].<ref>Sale, Richard.

The [[prototype]] tank, designated A-20, was specified with {{cvt|20|mm|in|1}} of [[vehicle armour|armour]], a 45&nbsp;mm (1.77&nbsp;in) gun, and the new [[Diesel model V-2|Model V-2-34]] engine, using less-flammable diesel fuel in a [[V12 engine|V12]] configuration designed by [[Chelpan Konstantin Fyodorovich|Konstantin Chelpan]]. It also had an 8\u00d76-wheel convertible drive similar to the BT tank's 8\u00d72, which allowed it to run on wheels without [[caterpillar track]]s.<ref>[[#Reference-Zheltov-1999|Zheltov 1999]]</ref> This feature had greatly saved on maintenance and repair of the unreliable tank tracks of the early 1930s, and allowed tanks to exceed {{convert|85|km/h}} on roads, but gave no advantage in combat and its complexity made it difficult to maintain. By 1937\u201338, track design had improved and the designers considered it a waste of space, weight, and maintenance resources, despite the road speed advantage.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:66, 111]]</ref> The A-20 also incorporated previous research (BT-IS and BT-SW-2 projects) into [[sloped armour]]: its all-round sloped armour plates were more likely to deflect rounds than perpendicular armour.<ref>Yaziv, D.; Chocron, S.; Anderson, Jr., C.E.; Grosch, D.J. \"Oblique Penetration in Ceramic Targets\". ''Proceedings of the 19th International Symposium on Ballistics IBS 2001'', Interlaken, Switzerland: 1257\u201364</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Lake Khasan]] in July 1938 and the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]] in 1939, an undeclared border war with [[Japan]] on the frontier with occupied [[Manchuria]], the Soviets deployed numerous tanks against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA). Although the IJA [[Type 95 Ha-Go]] light tanks had [[diesel engine]]s,<ref>{{harvnb|Zaloga|2007|pp=}}</ref> the Red Army's T-26 and BT tanks used petrol engines which, while common in tank designs of the time, often burst into flames when hit by IJA tank-killer teams<ref>[[#Reference-Coox|Coox 1990:311]]</ref> using [[Molotov cocktail]]s. Poor quality welds in the Soviet armour plates left small gaps between them, and flaming petrol from the Molotov cocktails easily seeped into the fighting and engine compartment; portions of the armour plating that had been assembled with [[rivet]]s also proved to be vulnerable.<ref>[[#Reference-Coox|Coox 1990:309]]</ref> The Soviet tanks were also easily destroyed by the Japanese Type 95 tank's 37&nbsp;mm gunfire, despite the low velocity of that gun,<ref>[[#Reference-Coox|Coox 1990:437, 993]]</ref> or \"at any other slightest provocation\".<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:111]]</ref> The use of riveted armour led to a problem whereby the impact of enemy shells, even if they failed to disable the tank or kill the crew on their own, would cause the rivets to break off and become projectiles inside the tank.\n\n[[File:Medium tank A-32.jpg|thumbnail|Medium tank A-32]]\nAfter these battles, Koshkin convinced Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] to let him develop a second prototype, a more heavily armed and armoured \"universal tank\" that reflected the lessons learned and could replace both the T-26 and the BT tanks. Koshkin named the second prototype A-32, after its {{cvt|32|mm|in|1}} of frontal armour. It had an L-10 76.2&nbsp;mm (3&nbsp;in) gun, and the same Model V-2-34 diesel.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Both were tested in [[quality control|field trials]] at [[Kubinka]] in 1939, with the heavier A-32 proving to be as mobile as the A-20. A still heavier version of the A-32, with 45&nbsp;mm (1.77&nbsp;in) of front armour, wider tracks, and a newer L-11 76.2&nbsp;mm gun, was approved for production as the T-34. Koshkin chose the name after the year 1934, when he began to formulate his ideas about the new tank, and to commemorate that year's decree expanding the armoured force and appointing [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]] to head tank production.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Reference-Zaloga-1994|Zaloga & Sarson 1994:6]]</ref>\n\nValuable lessons from Lake Khasan and Khalkhin Gol regarding armour protection, mobility, quality welding, and main guns were incorporated into the new T-34 tank, which represented a substantial improvement over the BT and T-26 tanks in all four areas.<ref>[[#Reference-Coox|Coox 1990:998]]</ref> Koshkin's team completed two prototype T-34s in January 1940. In April and May, they underwent a grueling {{convert|2000|km|adj=on}} drive from [[Kharkov]] to [[Moscow]] for a demonstration for the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] leaders, to the [[Mannerheim Line]] in [[Finland]], and back to Kharkov via [[Minsk]] and [[Kiev]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> Some [[powertrain|drivetrain]] shortcomings were identified and corrected.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1983|Zaloga & Grandsen 1983:6]]</ref>\n\n===Initial production{{Anchor|Establishing and maintaining production|Production history}}===\n[[File:T-34 Model 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-production prototype A-34 with a complex single-piece hull front.]]\n\nPolitical pressure came from conservative elements in the army to redirect resources into building the older T-26 and BT tanks, or to cancel T-34 production pending completion of the more advanced [[T-34 variants#Tanks|T-34M]] design. This pressure was brought to bear by the developer of the [[Kliment Voroshilov tank|KV-1]] tank which was in competition with the T-34.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nResistance from the military command and concerns about high production cost were finally overcome by anxieties about the poor performance of Soviet tanks in the [[Winter War]] in Finland, and the effectiveness of German tanks during the [[Battle of France]]. The first production T-34s were completed in September 1940, completely replacing the production of the T-26, the BT series and the multi-turreted [[T-28]] medium tank at the KhPZ plant.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1994|Zaloga & Sarson 1994:4]]</ref> Koshkin died of pneumonia (exacerbated by the drive from Kharkov to Moscow) at the end of that month, and the T-34's drivetrain developer, [[Alexander Alexandrovich Morozov|Alexander Morozov]], was appointed Chief Designer.<ref name=\"Zaloga-1984-130\">[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:130]]</ref>\n\nThe T-34 posed new challenges for the Soviet industry.

Alexander Morozov personally supervised the evacuation of all skilled engineers and laborers, machinery and stock from KhPZ to re-establish the factory at the site of the [[Uralvagonzavod|Dzerzhinsky Ural Railcar Factory]] in [[Nizhny Tagil]], renamed Stalin Ural Tank Factory N.183.<ref name=\"auto1\">[[#Reference-Zaloga-1983|Zaloga & Grandsen 1983:17]]</ref> The Kirovsky Factory, evacuated just weeks before the Germans surrounded Leningrad, moved with the Kharkov Diesel Factory to the [[Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant|Stalin Tractor Factory]] in [[Chelyabinsk]], soon to be nicknamed ''Tankograd'' (\"Tank City\"). The workers and machinery from Leningrad's Voroshilov Tank Factory N.174 were incorporated into the Ural Factory and the new Omsk Factory N.174. The [[Uralmash|Ordzhonikidze Ural Heavy Machine Tool Works]] (UZTM) in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] absorbed workers and machines from several small machine shops in the path of German forces.\n\nWhile these factories were being rapidly moved, the industrial complex surrounding the [[Volgograd Tractor Factory|Dzerzhinsky Tractor Factory]] in Stalingrad continued to work double shifts throughout the period of withdrawal (September 1941 to September 1942) to make up for production lost, and produced 40% of all T-34s during the period.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1983|Zaloga & Grandsen 1983:13]]</ref> As the factory became surrounded by heavy fighting in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1942, the situation there grew desperate: manufacturing innovations were necessitated by material shortages, and stories persist of unpainted T-34 tanks driven out of the factory directly to the battlefields around it.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1994|Zaloga & Sarson 1994:23]]</ref> Stalingrad kept up production until September 1942.\n\nSoviet designers were aware of design deficiencies in the tank, but most of the desired remedies would have slowed tank production and so were not implemented: the only changes allowed on the production lines through to 1944 were those to make production simpler and cheaper.

In 1944, a second major version began production, the T-34-85, with a larger 85&nbsp;mm gun intended to deal with newer German tanks.<ref name=\"Zaloga-1983-14\">[[#Reference-Zaloga-1983|Zaloga & Grandsen 1983:14]]</ref>\n\nComparisons can be drawn between the T-34 and the U.S. [[M4 Sherman]] tank. Both tanks were the backbone of the armoured units in their respective armies, both nations distributed these tanks to their allies, who also used them as the mainstay of their own armoured formations, and both were upgraded extensively and fitted with more powerful guns. Both were designed for mobility and ease of manufacture and maintenance, sacrificing some performance for these goals. Both chassis were used as the foundation for a variety of support vehicles, such as armour recovery vehicles, [[tank destroyer]]s, and self-propelled artillery. Both were an approximately even match for the standard German medium tank, the [[Panzer IV]], though each of these three tanks had particular advantages and weaknesses compared with the other two. Neither the T-34 nor the M4 was a match for Germany's heavier tanks, the [[Panther tank|Panther]] (technically a medium tank) or the [[Tiger I]]; the Soviets used the [[IS-2 heavy tank]] and the U.S. used the [[M26 Pershing]] as the heavy tanks of their forces instead.<ref>Zaloga & Grandsen 1983:37</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" summary=\"Characteristics and production cost of the main models of T-34, T-34-85 and T-44\"\n|+ Soviet medium tank models of World War II<ref name=\"Zaloga 2006\">[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga & Grandsen (1984:113, 184)]], [[#Reference-Harrison-2002|Harrison (2002:181)]], [[#Reference-KMDB-2006|KMDB (2006)]].</ref>\n|-\n!

The shape also saved weight by reducing the thickness required to achieve equal protection. A few tanks also had [[appliqu\u00e9 armour]] of varying thickness welded onto the hull and turret. Tanks thus modified were called ''s ekranami'' ({{lang-ru|\u0441 \u044d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438}}, \"with screens\").<ref name=\"Zaloga-1983-14\" />\n\nThe USSR donated two combat-used Model 1941 T-34s to the United States for testing purposes in late 1942.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kavalerchik|first=Boris|date=March 2015|title=Once Again About the T-34|journal=The Journal of Slavic Military Studies|volume=28|pages=186\u2013214|doi=10.1080/13518046.2015.998132|pmid=}}</ref> The examinations, performed at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], revealed problems with overall armour build quality, especially of the plate joins and welds, as well as the use of soft steel combined with shallow surface tempering.

In one wartime account, a single T-34 came under heavy fire upon encountering one of the most common German anti-tank guns at that stage of the war: \"Remarkably enough, one determined [[PaK 37mm|37&nbsp;mm gun]] crew reported firing 23 times against a single T-34 tank, only managing to jam the tank\u2019s turret ring.\"<ref name=\"S.

Tank commander A.K. Rodkin commented: \"the tank could have dug the ground with it in the smallest ditch [filling the barrel with dirt]. If you fired it after that, the barrel would open up at the end like the petals of a flower\", destroying the barrel.

In addition, its pneumatic engine starting system, fed from a compressed air cylinder mounted inside the tank's bow, remained reliable even in the coldest conditions.

The two-man [[gun turret|turret]] crew arrangement required the commander to aim and fire the gun, an arrangement common to most Soviet tanks of the day. The two-man turret was \"cramped and inefficient\"{{sfn|Hughes|Mann|2002|p=63}} and was inferior to the three-man (commander, gunner, and loader) turret crews of German Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks.

Nicknamed ''[[pirozhok]]'' (stuffed bun) because of its characteristic shape, it was heavy and hard to open. The complaints of the crews urged the design group led by Alexander Morozov to switch in August 1942<ref>http://english.battlefield.ru/t-34.html</ref> to using two hatches in the turret.<ref>[[#Reference-Drabkin|Drabkin & Sheremet 2006:27-28]]</ref>\n\nThe loader also had a difficult job due to the lack of a turret basket (a rotating floor that moves as the turret turns); the same fault was present on all German tanks prior to the Panzer IV. The floor under the T-34's turret was made up of ammunition stored in small metal boxes, covered by a rubber mat. There were nine ready rounds of ammunition stowed in racks on the sides of the fighting compartment. Once these rounds had been used, the crew had to pull additional ammunition out of the floor boxes, leaving the floor littered with open bins and matting and reducing their performance.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:137]]</ref>\n\n{{quotation|The main weakness [of the two-man turret of a T-34 Model 1941] is that it is very tight.

Early in the tank's life, however, this advantage was greatly reduced by the numerous teething troubles the design displayed: a long road trip could be a lethal exercise for a T-34 tank at the start of the war. When in June 1941, the [[8th Mechanised Corps]] of [[D.I. Ryabyshev]] marched towards Dubno, the corps lost half of its vehicles. A.V. Bodnar, who was in combat in 1941\u201342, recalled:\n\n{{quotation|From the point of view of operating them, the German armored machines were almost perfect, they broke down less often.

The Model 1942 featured increased armour on the turret and many simplified components.

Also added were an improved engine air filter and a new clutch mated to an improved and more reliable five-speed transmission.<ref name=\"Zaloga 2006\" /> Finally, the Model 1943 also had a new, slightly roomier (but still two-man) turret of a distinctive hexagonal shape that was easier to manufacture, derived from the abandoned [[T-34 variants#Tanks|T-34M]] project.<ref name=\"auto2\" />\n\nThe T-34 was essential in resisting the German summer offensive in 1942, and executing the double encirclement manoeuver that cut off the German Sixth Army at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in December 1942.

It was the debut of the German [[Panther tank]], although the numbers employed at Kursk were small and the brunt of the burden was carried by the [[Panzer III]], [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III|StuG III]], and [[Panzer IV]]. The campaign featured the largest tank battles in history. The high-water mark of the battle was the massive armour engagement at [[Battle of Prokhorovka|Prokhorovka]], which began on 12 July, though the vast majority of armour losses on both sides were caused by artillery and mines, rather than tanks.<ref name=\"Prokhorovka Interview\">{{cite web|last1=Zamulin|first1=Valeriy|title=Prokhorovka Interview|url=http://worldoftanks.ru/ru/news/pc-browser/12/prokhorovka_interview_zamulin/?|website=World of Tanks|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref> Over 6,000 fully tracked armoured vehicles, 4,000 combat aircraft, and 2 million men are believed to have participated in these battles.\n\nThe Soviet high command's decision to focus on one cost-effective design, cutting costs and simplifying production wherever possible while only allowing relatively minor improvements, had proven to be an astute choice for the first two years of the war. However, the battles in the summer of 1943 demonstrated that the 76.2&nbsp;mm gun of the T-34 was no longer as effective as it was in 1941. Soviet tank crews struggled at longer ranges with the additional frontal armour applied to the later variants of the Panzer III and Panzer IV, and were unable to penetrate the frontal armour of the new German Panther or Tiger I tank at standard combat ranges without tungsten rounds, and had to rely on tactical skill through flanking maneuvers and combined arms.<ref name=\"Prokhorovka Interview\" />\n\n===T-34-85===\n[[File:P82-2l.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A T-34 Model 1942 (left), next to the [[T-43 medium tank|T-43]].]]\nAfter improved German Panzer IVs with the high-velocity [[7.5 cm KwK 40|75&nbsp;mm (2.95&nbsp;in) gun]] were encountered in combat in 1942, a project to design an entirely new Soviet tank was begun, with the goals of increasing armour protection while adding modern features like a [[torsion-bar]] suspension and a three-man turret. The new tank, the [[T-43 medium tank|T-43]], was intended to be a universal model to replace both the T-34 and the [[KV-1 (tank)|KV-1]] heavy tank. However, the T-43 prototype's armour, though heavier, was not capable against German 88&nbsp;mm guns, while its mobility was found to be inferior to the T-34. Finally, although the T-43 shared over 70% of its components with the T-34, manufacturing it would still have required a significant slow-down in production.<ref name=\"zaloga1997\">[[#Reference-Zaloga-1997|Zaloga et al. 1997:5]]</ref> Consequently, the T-43 was cancelled.\n\nNot only were the weapons of German tanks improving, so was their armour. Soviet firing tests against a captured Tiger I heavy tank in April 1943 showed that the T-34's 76&nbsp;mm gun could not penetrate the front of the Tiger I at all, and the side only at the very close range. A Soviet 85&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, the [[85 mm air defense gun M1939 (52-K)|52-K]], was found capable of doing the job, and so derivatives of it were developed for tanks.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eugene Boldyrev |url=http://www.battlefield.ru/content/view/87/43/lang,en/ |title=\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a \u0422-34-85 \u2013 The Russian Battlefield |publisher=Battlefield.ru |date=2005-09-20 |accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref><ref>Healy 2008:167\u2013171</ref> The resulting tank gun could penetrate the side armour of the Tiger I from a distance of 800 meters and the turret side from a distance of 600 meters.

Its turret ring was enlarged from 1,425&nbsp;mm (56&nbsp;in) to 1,600&nbsp;mm (63&nbsp;in), allowing a larger turret to be fitted and thus the larger 85&nbsp;mm gun. The prototype T-43's turret design was hurriedly adopted by Vyacheslav Kerichev at the [[Krasnoye Sormovo Factory]] to fit the T-34.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1984|Zaloga & Grandsen 1984:166]]</ref> This was a larger three-man turret, with radio (previously in the hull) and observation cupola in the roof. Now the tank commander needed only to command (aided by cupola and radio systems), leaving the operation of the gun to the gunner and the loader. The turret armour was much thicker, 90&nbsp;mm, even if bigger and less sloped than the original T-34 turret. This made the turret, overall, a bigger target (due to the three-man crew and bigger gun), but more resistant to enemy fire. The ammunition load shrank from around 90-100 to 55-60 shells, but the projectiles were 50% heavier (9&nbsp;kg) and were much better in the anti-armour role, and reasonable in a general purpose role. The resulting new tank, the T-34-85, was seen as a compromise between advocates for the T-43 and others who wanted to continue to build as many 76&nbsp;mm-armed T-34s as possible without interruption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=63|title=T-34/85 \u2013 Medium Tank \u2013 History, Specs and Pictures \u2013 Military Tanks, Vehicles and Artillery|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:T-34-85 interior Parola Tank Museum.jpg|thumb|Interior of a T-34-85 viewed from the driver's hatch, showing the ammunition boxes on which the loader had to stand in the absence of a turret basket.

While it could not match the armour or weapons of the heavier Panther and Tiger tanks, its improved firepower made it much more effective than earlier models, and overall it was more cost-effective than the heaviest German tanks.

In 1956, they were used as regular tanks to support Egyptian infantry, the tank was still in use by the 1973 October war.\n\nThe Syrian Army also received T-34-85s from the Soviet Union and they took part in the many artillery duels with Israeli tanks in November 1964 and in the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967.\n\n====The Warsaw Pact====\nT-34-85s equipped many of the armies of Eastern European countries (later forming the [[Warsaw Pact]]) and the armies of other Soviet client-states elsewhere.

The T-34-85 was the first Soviet tank to enter service with the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]] (FAR), along with the [[IS tank family|IS-2]].

The Cuban forces were mobilised to stop them. As they approached Cassinga they were strafed by South African aircraft, which destroyed most of the BTR-152s and three of the T-34-85s; a fourth T-34-85 was disabled by an anti-tank mine buried in the road.

The bomber, [[Josef Kneifel]], was sentenced to life imprisonment in [[Bautzen]], but was released after a deal with the West German government in 1987. After [[German unification]] in 1990, the tank was transferred to a museum in Ingolstadt.<ref>Honnigfort, Bernhard. \"Der Panzersprenger.\" ''Frankfurter Rundschau'', April 15, 2005.</ref><ref>Honnigfort, Bernhard. \"Der sich nicht f\u00fcgen wollte.\" ''K\u00f6lner Stadt-Anzeiger'', April 17, 2005.</ref>\n\nAnother such tank, mounted atop the [[monument to Soviet tank crews]] in [[Prague]], was the focus of significant controversy. The monument (known locally as 'Saint Tank') was intended to represent Lt I.G. Goncharenko's T-34-85 (the first Soviet tank to enter Prague during the [[Prague Offensive|liberation of Czechoslovakia]] in May 1945), but actually bore an [[Iosif Stalin tank|IS-2M]] heavy tank. To many in Prague, the tank was also a reminder of the Soviet invasion which ended the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968. The tank was painted pink by artist [[David \u010cern\u00fd]] in 1991. Following an official protest from the Russian government, the arrest of \u010cern\u00fd, a coat of official green paint, public demonstrations, and a further coat of pink paint applied by fifteen parliamentary deputies, the tank was finally removed to a military museum.<ref>[[#Reference-Wright-2001|Wright 2001:379]]</ref><ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1996|Zaloga & Kinnear 1996:42\u201343]]</ref>\n\n''Four Tankers and a Dog'' (''[[Czterej pancerni i pies]]''), a very successful war-themed [[Telewizja Polska|Polish television series]] of the 1960s, adapted the novel of the same name by the [[Polish literature|Polish writer]] [[Janusz Przymanowski]] (1922\u20131998), himself a [[People's Army of Poland]] volunteer.

The identification of T-34 variants can be complicated. Turret castings, superficial details, and equipment differed between factories; new features were added in the middle of production runs, or retrofitted to older tanks; damaged tanks were rebuilt, sometimes with the addition of newer-model equipment and even new turrets.<ref name=\"Zaloga-1983-14\" />\n\nThe Red Army never had a consistent policy for naming the T-34.<ref>[[#Reference-Zaloga-1994|Zaloga & Sarson 1994:19]]</ref> Since at least the 1980s, however, many academic sources (notably, [[armoured fighting vehicle|AFV]] expert [[Steven Zaloga]]) have used Soviet-style nomenclature: ''T-34'' for the models armed with 76.2&nbsp;mm guns, and ''T-34-85'' for models armed with 85&nbsp;mm guns, with minor models distinguished by year, as ''T-34 Model 1940''. Some Russian historians use different names: they refer to the first T-34 as the ''T-34 Model 1939'' instead of 1940, all T-34s with the original turret and F-34 gun as ''Model 1941'' instead of Models 1941 and 1942, and the [[hexagon]]al-turret T-34 as ''Model 1942'' instead of 1943.<ref>[[#Reference-Zheltov-2001|Zheltov 2001, passim]]</ref>\n\nGerman [[military intelligence]] in World War II referred to the two main production families as ''T-34/76'' and ''T-34/85'', with subvariants receiving letter designations such as ''T-34/76A'' \u2014 this nomenclature has been widely used in the West, especially in popular literature. When the German Wehrmacht used captured T-34s, it designated them ''Panzerkampfwagen T-34(r)'', where the \"r\" stood for ''russisch'' (\"Russian\").<ref>Carruthers, Bob.

In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, 16-year old [[Katniss Everdeen]] volunteers to take her place. Primrose gives Katniss a mockingjay pin. She and fellow tribute [[Peeta Mellark]] are then escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the only Games winner from District 12. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the \"Careers\" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.\n\nAt the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of [[The Hunger Games universe#Tracker Jackers|tracker jackers]], genetically modified poisonous wasps. Using a knife, Katniss saws off the branch holding the nest, causing it to fall on the Careers sleeping below; Glimmer dies, but the others escape. Katniss becomes disoriented from being stung a few times. Peeta returns and tells her to flee.\n\nRue helps Katniss recover, and they become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers stockpiled by detonating mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss later finds and frees Rue from a trap, but Marvel throws a spear at Katniss which impales Rue. Katniss kills him with an arrow. She comforts Rue and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers. This triggers a riot in District 11. President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane about the unrest.\n\nHaymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's vehement opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him, but she is ambushed and overpowered by Clove, who gloats about Rue's death and prepares to kill her. [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Thresh|Thresh]], District 11's male tribute, overhears and kills Clove. He spares Katniss once, for Rue's sake. The medicine heals Peeta overnight.\n\nWhile hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signalling a death. She races to Peeta, who has unwittingly collected deadly nightlock berries. They discover \"Foxface\", District 5's female tribute, dead from eating what she assumed were edible berries from watching Peeta.\n\nCrane then unleashes genetically modified beasts. They kill Thresh and force Katniss, Peeta, and Cato - the last three survivors - onto the Cornucopia's roof. Cato gets Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below. Katniss kills him with an arrow to end his suffering.\n\nCrane then revokes the rule change allowing two victors to win. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him to eat nightlock together. Just before they do, Crane hastily declares them co-victors. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies through these acts of defiance. Snow has Crane locked in a room with nightlock berries.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jennifer Lawrence SDCC 2015.jpg|thumb|198px|[[Jennifer Lawrence]] wore a dark brown wig to play Katniss.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/43990-hows-jennifer-lawrences-wig-in-mockingjay-holding-up-lets-see-here-photos|title=How's J Law's 'Mockingjay' Wig Holding Up?|website=Bustle|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>]]\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games characters}}\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games cast members}}\n<!--Reordered to match billing of primary source: the film -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Katniss Everdeen]]<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/jennifer-lawrence-gets-lead-role-hunger-games-25482 | title=Jennifer Lawrence Gets Lead Role in 'The Hunger Games' | author=Joshua L.

The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room.\"<ref name=\"nyt-qanda\" /> Ross and [[visual effects supervisor]] Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal [[dei ex machina]] Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that \"we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie?

[[Katniss Everdeen]] ([[Jennifer Lawrence]]) volunteers to take her younger sister's place, and with her district's male tribute, [[Peeta Mellark]] ([[Josh Hutcherson]]), travels to the Capitol to train and compete in the games.\n\nDevelopment of ''The Hunger Games'' began in March 2009 when [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] entered into a co-production agreement with [[Color Force]], which had acquired the rights a few weeks earlier. Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay. The screenplay expanded the character of [[Seneca Crane]] to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience and Ross added several scenes between Crane and [[Coriolanus Snow]]. The main characters were cast between March and May 2011.

The film also received numerous nominations, including the [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]]. For her performance, Lawrence won the Saturn Award for [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], the [[Critics' Choice Movie Award]] for [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie|Best Actress in an Action Movie]], the [[Empire Award]] for [[Empire Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], and was also nominated for the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].

In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, 16-year old [[Katniss Everdeen]] volunteers to take her place. Primrose gives Katniss a mockingjay pin. She and fellow tribute [[Peeta Mellark]] are then escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the only Games winner from District 12. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the \"Careers\" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.\n\nAt the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of [[The Hunger Games universe#Tracker Jackers|tracker jackers]], genetically modified poisonous wasps. Using a knife, Katniss saws off the branch holding the nest, causing it to fall on the Careers sleeping below; Glimmer dies, but the others escape. Katniss becomes disoriented from being stung a few times. Peeta returns and tells her to flee.\n\nRue helps Katniss recover, and they become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers stockpiled by detonating mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss later finds and frees Rue from a trap, but Marvel throws a spear at Katniss which impales Rue. Katniss kills him with an arrow. She comforts Rue and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers. This triggers a riot in District 11. President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane about the unrest.\n\nHaymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's vehement opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him, but she is ambushed and overpowered by Clove, who gloats about Rue's death and prepares to kill her. [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Thresh|Thresh]], District 11's male tribute, overhears and kills Clove. He spares Katniss once, for Rue's sake. The medicine heals Peeta overnight.\n\nWhile hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signalling a death. She races to Peeta, who has unwittingly collected deadly nightlock berries. They discover \"Foxface\", District 5's female tribute, dead from eating what she assumed were edible berries from watching Peeta.\n\nCrane then unleashes genetically modified beasts. They kill Thresh and force Katniss, Peeta, and Cato - the last three survivors - onto the Cornucopia's roof. Cato gets Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below. Katniss kills him with an arrow to end his suffering.\n\nCrane then revokes the rule change allowing two victors to win. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him to eat nightlock together. Just before they do, Crane hastily declares them co-victors. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies through these acts of defiance.

The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room.\"<ref name=\"nyt-qanda\" /> Ross and [[visual effects supervisor]] Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal [[dei ex machina]] Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that \"we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie?
