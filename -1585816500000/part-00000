The redevelopment ran into the [[2011 AFL season]] and the Gold Coast were again required to find a temporary home ground.

Six days later the Gold Coast Suns hosted their first home match at the redeveloped Carrara Stadium against the Geelong Cats in front of a sell out crowd. Two months later, the Suns attracted the largest crowd ever at the Carrara Stadium in a game against Collingwood that attracted an attendance of 23,302, a record broken in round 16 of 2014 when 24,032 attended also against Collingwood.\n\nThe seating capacity was temporarily upgraded to 40,000 as part of the Gold Coast's successful bid to host the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]].\n\nThe Gold Coast Suns hosted Port Adelaide in front of 0 fans to start the 202 season, this turnout was in line with future crowd number expectations for the struggling club. <ref>[https://www.austadiums.com/sport/event.php?eventid=23213/ AFL: Port Adelaide d Gold Coast Suns]</ref>.\n\n==Corporate==\n\n===Membership base===\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; border-collapse:collapse; width:80%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#C1D8FF;\"\n!

Inaugural coach [[Guy McKenna]] was sacked at season's end, leaving the club after 88 games in charge and winning just over 25% of them.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/sport/afl/gold-coast-sacks-guy-mckenna-as-speculation-mounts-club-will-make-play-for-essendons-mark-thompson/story-fndv8hfz-1227075696214?from=public_rss Gold Coast sacks Guy McKenna as speculation mounts club will make play for Essendon\u2019s Mark Thompson], ''News.com.au'', 1 October 2014</ref>\n\nIn 2020 as a result of the Coronavirus outbreak, Gold Coast Suns staff have been stood down, which will be a precursor towards abolishing the Suns from the AFL competition, or merging them with another similarly financially unstable and poorly supported Victorian team, such as North Melbourne or the Western Bulldogs. <ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/suns-football-department-staff-stood-down-indefinitely-20200323-p54cxb.html | title =Gold Coast Suns stood down |date= 23 March 2020}}</ref>. \n\n<!--===2015&ndash;present: Rodney Eade===-->\n\n==Stadium==\n{{Infobox venue\n| stadium_name = Carrara Stadium\n| nickname = \n| image =    [[File:Adelaide v Gold Coast - Carrara crowd.jpg|250px]]\n| location =[[Nerang\u2013Broadbeach Road]],<br />[[Carrara, Queensland|Carrara]], [[Queensland, Australia|Queensland]],<br />[[Australia]], 4211\n| opened = 1987\n| renovated = 2010\u201311\n| owner = [[Queensland Government]]\n| operator = Stadiums Queensland\n| architect = [[Populous (company)|Populous]] (2010)\n| seating_capacity = 25,000 (23,500 seats)\n| dimensions = 171 x 144&nbsp;metres\n}}\n{{Main|Carrara Stadium}}\n\nGold Coast began playing at Carrara Stadium in their foundation year of 2009. Although the ground had existed since 1987, the Gold Coast Football Club's establishment in late 2008 prompted the club to use the stadium as their home ground during the [[2009 TAC Cup]]. The ground opened in 1987 and was used by the [[Brisbane Bears]] for the first six years of existence and was later used by the [[North Melbourne Kangaroos]] and several professional [[Rugby league]] teams.\n\nThe insufficient and outdated facilities at Carrara Stadium led to the [[Australian Football League]] investigating several stadium options for the Gold Coast's inaugural AFL season in 2011. A new $172 million stadium in [[Helensvale, Queensland|Helensvale]] was a strongly considered option.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chambers|first=Geoff|title=D-day vote on $2 billion city projects|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2008/09/04/15858_gold-coast-feature.html|newspaper=goldcoast.com.au|date=4 September 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Chambers|first=Geoff|title=Council will chip in $10m transit centre cash for Aussie rules site|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2008/09/05/15906_gold-coast-top-story.html|newspaper=goldcoast.com.au|date=5 September 2008}}</ref> The AFL eventually brokered a deal with the [[Gold Coast City Council]] and the [[Queensland Government]] to redevelop Carrara Stadium. The $144.2 million upgrade would increase the stadium capacity to 25,000.\n\nConstruction for the redevelopment of Carrara Stadium began in December 2009 and the Gold Coast was required to find a new home ground for the [[2010 VFL season]]. The team shared their games among local grounds [[Fankhauser Reserve]], [[H & A Oval]] and [[Cooke-Murphy Oval]]. The redevelopment ran into the [[2011 AFL season]] and the Gold Coast were again required to find a temporary home ground. The Suns elected to use [[the Gabba]] for their first three home games of the 2011 season.\n\nThe redeveloped Carrara Stadium (commercially known as Metricon Stadium) was officially opened on 22 May 2011 by [[Queensland Premier]] [[Anna Bligh]]. Six days later the Gold Coast Suns hosted their first home match at the redeveloped Carrara Stadium against the Geelong Cats in front of a sell out crowd. Two months later, the Suns attracted the largest crowd ever at the Carrara Stadium in a game against Collingwood that attracted an attendance of 23,302, a record broken in round 16 of 2014 when 24,032 attended also against Collingwood.\n\nThe seating capacity was temporarily upgraded to 40,000 as part of the Gold Coast's successful bid to host the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]].\n\nThe Gold Coast Suns hosted Port Adelaide in front of 0 fans to start the 202 season, this turnout was in line with future crowd number expectations for the struggling club. <ref>[https://www.austadiums.com/sport/event.php?eventid=23213/ AFL: Port Adelaide d Gold Coast Suns]</ref>.\n\n==Corporate==\n\n===Membership base===\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; border-collapse:collapse; width:80%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#C1D8FF;\"\n!

The macOS version was released on August 3, 2017.\n\n==Story and gameplay==\nThe game takes place in a [[high fantasy]] setting. The story is told through on-screen narrative passages that include a [[hyperlink]]-type system used by the player-character to explore the story further. In addition to guiding the exiles during \"Rites\" which resemble a sports game, the Reader must determine how to help support or improve the party, by performing activities such as scavenging for supplies, learning more of the world's lore, or mentoring the exiles to improve their abilities.<ref name=\"gamespot pax\" />\n\nThrough the land, the party encounters other groups of exiles, which starts the Rites, the game's combat system which was described by Marty Silva of ''[[IGN]]'' as a mix of ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'', ''[[Rocket League]]'', and Supergiant's previous game, ''[[Transistor (video game)|Transistor]]''.<ref name=\"ign pax\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/22/pax-east-2016-supergiants-pyre-is-beautiful-and-impossibly-weird-in-a-good-way | title  = PAX East 2016: Supergiant's Pyre Is Beautiful and Impossibly Weird (in a Good Way!) | first = Marty | last = Silva | date = April 23, 2016 | accessdate = April 23, 2016 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> Rites takes place on a field with two columns of flame, or pyres, at opposite ends and the three exiles facing off against three opponents on a top-down perspective. Each team attempts to destroy the opposing pyre by launching a single glowing orb at it, which steadily whittles away at its health. The player only controls one character at a time by passing the orb among the three. A character traveling with the orb is vulnerable to being temporarily banished from the Rites if an enemy's aura touches them, which would drop the orb at their feet. The different characters have various skills that aid them in the Rites, such as dashes or long-range projectiles. Each of the player's characters also have different passive abilities, such as one that can move quickly about this arena but does little damage to the opponent's pyre, while another is slow and bulky, but can do the greatest damage.<ref name=\"gamespot pax\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/supergiants-pyre-focuses-on-companionship-and-a-li/1100-6439108/  | title = Supergiant's Pyre Focuses on Companionship and a Little Bit of Sports | work = [[GameSpot]] | first = Alexa Ray | last = Corriea | date = April 23, 2016 | accessdate = April 23, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/supergiants-new-game-is-sort-of-a-mystical-sports-rpg-1772659794| title = Supergiant's Audacious New Game Pyre Is Sort Of A Mystical Sports RPG | first = Stephan | last = Totilo | date = April 23, 2016 | accessdate = April 23, 2016 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}</ref>\n\nThe game includes a local multiplayer mode which allows two players controlling separate teams to compete.

The macOS version was released on August 3, 2017.\n\n==Story and gameplay==\nThe game takes place in a [[high fantasy]] setting. The story is told through on-screen narrative passages that include a [[hyperlink]]-type system used by the player-character to explore the story further. In addition to guiding the exiles during \"Rites\" which resemble a sports game, the Reader must determine how to help support or improve the party, by performing activities such as scavenging for supplies, learning more of the world's lore, or mentoring the exiles to improve their abilities.<ref name=\"gamespot pax\" />\n\nThrough the land, the party encounters other groups of exiles, which starts the Rites, the game's combat system which was described by Marty Silva of ''[[IGN]]'' as a mix of ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'', ''[[Rocket League]]'', and Supergiant's previous game, ''[[Transistor (video game)|Transistor]]''.<ref name=\"ign pax\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/22/pax-east-2016-supergiants-pyre-is-beautiful-and-impossibly-weird-in-a-good-way | title  = PAX East 2016: Supergiant's Pyre Is Beautiful and Impossibly Weird (in a Good Way!) | first = Marty | last = Silva | date = April 23, 2016 | accessdate = April 23, 2016 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> Rites takes place on a field with two columns of flame, or pyres, at opposite ends and the three exiles facing off against three opponents on a top-down perspective. Each team attempts to destroy the opposing pyre by launching a single glowing orb at it, which steadily whittles away at its health. The player only controls one character at a time by passing the orb among the three. A character traveling with the orb is vulnerable to being temporarily banished from the Rites if an enemy's aura touches them, which would drop the orb at their feet. The different characters have various skills that aid them in the Rites, such as dashes or long-range projectiles. Each of the player's characters also have different passive abilities, such as one that can move quickly about this arena but does little damage to the opponent's pyre, while another is slow and bulky, but can do the greatest damage.<ref name=\"gamespot pax\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/supergiants-pyre-focuses-on-companionship-and-a-li/1100-6439108/  | title = Supergiant's Pyre Focuses on Companionship and a Little Bit of Sports | work = [[GameSpot]] | first = Alexa Ray | last = Corriea | date = April 23, 2016 | accessdate = April 23, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/supergiants-new-game-is-sort-of-a-mystical-sports-rpg-1772659794| title = Supergiant's Audacious New Game Pyre Is Sort Of A Mystical Sports RPG | first = Stephan | last = Totilo | date = April 23, 2016 | accessdate = April 23, 2016 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}</ref>\n\nThe game includes a local multiplayer mode which allows two players controlling separate teams to compete.

Despite early contributions that were later scrapped, it marked the departure of mainstay Deftones producer [[Terry Date]]. It was also their last released album to feature bassist [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] before [[Chi Cheng (musician)#Automobile crash and coma|his car accident]] in 2008, which led to his death five years later.\n\n''Saturday Night Wrist'' was the product of an arduous and stressful creative process lasting roughly two years and straining relationships within the band. Complicating matters and inspiring many of its songs were frontman [[Chino Moreno]]'s drug addictions and the crumbling of his marriage. The final result was an album met with critical praise.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Early writing and recording===\nIn early 2004, Maverick Records told Deftones they needed to head into the studio due to the lackluster sales of the band's [[Deftones (album)|self-titled effort]]. They began pioneering ideas for a new album at their studio, The Spot, in [[Sacramento, California]]. On April 30, 2004, they announced they would be relocating to [[Malibu, California]], to continue writing the album at Morning View House, famous for being the place that [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] recorded their fourth album, ''[[Morning View]]''. Deftones spent most of the summer there, resulting in an album's worth of material that Moreno described as \"straight evil music\".\n\nThey then began searching for a producer and started recording. They initially considered enlisting [[Ken Andrews]] of [[Failure (band)|Failure]] and [[Ric Ocasek]] of [[the Cars]], but to no avail. They then worked with [[Dan the Automator]] for about a week. According to guitarist [[Stephen Carpenter]], during collaboration with Dan, Deftones seemed to be pursuing the \"more technical\", [[mathcore|math metal]]-based elements of the band's sound. After some deliberation, however, Moreno and drummer [[Abe Cunningham]] successfully pushed for working with producer [[Bob Ezrin]] ([[Pink Floyd]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]) and engineer Brian Virtue.\n\nDeftones then took a short break before planning a month-long tour with [[Dredg]] and C-Minus to road-test some material starting in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], and ending in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], near where Ezrin's studio was located. Recording of the album began in November 2004. During the sessions, tensions mounted within the band and between singer Moreno and producer Ezrin. Moreno eventually jumped ship to continue work on his side project [[Team Sleep]] while the rest of the band continued recording. The Ezrin sessions concluded before [[Christmas]] and the band relocated back to their home base in [[Sacramento]] to take a break.\n\nIn early 2005, Deftones started tweaking the Ezrin material with Virtue at their studio The Spot, writing several new songs in the process. Moreno decided to take a break from recording in the spring to tour with Team Sleep, who were also releasing their long-awaited debut album. Moreno claimed that this was good for him, as he was somewhat unable to focus on the recording sessions due to his [[amphetamine|speed]] and alcohol addictions, as well as the dissolution of his longtime marriage to wife Celeste.\n\n===Hiatus===\nThe rest of the band, while anxious to finish the album, decided it would be best to take a break from music. During the hiatus, Deftones released a 10-year anniversary CD/DVD, titled ''[[B-Sides & Rarities (Deftones album)|B-Sides & Rarities]]'', on October 4, 2005. It included one of the songs from the Virtue sessions, a [[Cover version|cover]] of \"Wax and Wane\" by [[Cocteau Twins]]. In late 2005, Moreno met with Date to help record vocals for some of the remaining tracks. The band also managed to quickly record a cover of [[John Lennon]]'s \"[[Jealous Guy]]\" for [[Amnesty International]] as well as an [[iTunes]] exclusive cover of the Cars' \"[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]\".\n\n===Continuation on production===\nIn early 2006, all previously recorded vocals were scrapped and the band started working on the album again with longtime friend [[Shaun Lopez]] (of [[Far (band)|Far]] and [[the Revolution Smile]]) acting as producer. The album was edited by Ryan Gorman. Finally, with all recording finished in April 2006, the album was mixed by Ryan Williams.\n\nThe album featured musical contributions from [[Annie Hardy]] of [[Giant Drag]] and [[Serj Tankian]] of [[System of a Down]]; the latter also contributed to the writing of one song, \"[[Mein (song)|Mein]]\".\n\nCarpenter stated in interviews that a significant portion of the songs were based on ideas by Moreno and that \"Pink Cellphone\", minus Hardy's vocals, was \"all Chino\". In fact, Moreno plays second guitar on many of the songs, including \"[[Hole in the Earth]]\", \"Beware\", \"Cherry Waves\", \"U,U,D,D,L,R,L,R,A,B,Select,Start\", \"Xerces\" and \"Rivi\u00e8re\". However, Moreno stated that \"Rats!Rats!Rats!\" was \"all Stephen\". Carpenter wrote and recorded all guitar parts on \"Rapture\", \"Rats!Rats!Rats!\" and \"Kimdracula\", but also played guitar and wrote guitar parts for all songs except \"U,U,D,D,L,R,L,R,A,B,Select,Start\", where he played drums and Moreno played guitar. The title for the latter song was a reference to the [[Konami Code]], a famous [[video game]] [[cheat code]].\n\nThe writing and recording process of ''Saturday Night Wrist'' was fraught and placed strain on the relationships within the band. Moreno stated that making it was \"a seriously unhealthy experience\", and that it \"dragged on without much direction\". Following its creation, after leaving to work on Team Sleep, he stated that he \"wasn't sure if [he] was going to return\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Albums for 2008: Deftones | journal = [[Kerrang!]] | issue = 1191 | date = January 5, 2008 | page = 47}}</ref>\n\n==Lyrical themes==\nMoreno described the lyrical subject matter of some of the songs in later interviews. He explained that \"Kimdracula\" was part of his email address at the beginning of making the record, during his heavy drug-use phase. \"Beware\" was a warning to others about sex, drugs and drinking, which were the three main problems he encountered during the album's creation. A story about a witch that Moreno wrote during his drug phase was told in \"Rivi\u00e8re\". \"Cherry Waves\" was about testing the trust a person has in someone else. The confusion Moreno experienced when making ''Saturday Night Wrist'' was illustrated in the song \"Rapture\". Communication issues between the divided band, during the making of the album, were captured in \"Hole in the Earth\".\n\nMoreno explained the record's title as being a reference to the [[Radial neuropathy|nerve damage]] caused when an intoxicated person falls asleep on his or her arm. He elaborated on the title, referencing \"when you're alone on Saturday nights and your only best friend is your shaking wrist\".<ref>Snelling N, \"Deftones\" ''Beat Magazine'' (Australia) Issue 1051, February 14, 2007 at p.28.</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Saturday Night Wrist'' was released on October 31, 2006. It was leaked on the Internet on October 13, over two weeks prior to its release. [[Lead single]] \"Hole in the Earth\" was sent to radio on October 16.\n\nA collection of 16 demos from the Ezrin sessions later became available online, containing rough vocal mixes of \"Cherry Waves\" and \"Combat\", an instrumental version of what would become \"Finger of Death\", and several instrumentals recorded by the band without Moreno that did not make the final cut.\n\nThe [[iTunes]] version included the cover of \"Drive\" by the Cars, which featured producer Lopez as well as a prominent sample of [[Massive Attack]]'s track \"[[Protection (Massive Attack song)|Protection]]\" (from their [[Protection (Massive Attack album)|album of the same name]]).\n{{Album ratings\n| MC         = 72/100<ref name=\"Meta\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/saturday-night-wrist/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Saturday Night Wrist |website=Metacritic |accessdate=2014-07-22}}</ref>\n| rev1       = ''[[The A.V.

They have all the tension and dynamic, all the immediacy of yore, but the mix is spacious, and Chino Moreno's vocals soar above it\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> A less enthusiastic, although positive, review came from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s Christian Hoard, who compared the band's \"[[space rock|space-rock]] overlays\" with [[Radiohead]], but pointed out that \"The songwriting never quite comes

[[Deftones]], released on October 31, 2006 by [[Maverick Records]]. Despite early contributions that were later scrapped, it marked the departure of mainstay Deftones producer [[Terry Date]]. It was also their last released album to feature bassist [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] before [[Chi Cheng (musician)#Automobile crash and coma|his car accident]] in 2008, which led to his death five years later.\n\n''Saturday Night Wrist'' was the product of an arduous and stressful creative process lasting roughly two years and straining relationships within the band. Complicating matters and inspiring many of its songs were frontman [[Chino Moreno]]'s drug addictions and the crumbling of his marriage. The final result was an album met with critical praise.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Early writing and recording===\nIn early 2004, Maverick Records told Deftones they needed to head into the studio due to the lackluster sales of the band's [[Deftones (album)|self-titled effort]]. They began pioneering ideas for a new album at their studio, The Spot, in [[Sacramento, California]]. On April 30, 2004, they announced they would be relocating to [[Malibu, California]], to continue writing the album at Morning View House, famous for being the place that [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] recorded their fourth album, ''[[Morning View]]''. Deftones spent most of the summer there, resulting in an album's worth of material that Moreno described as \"straight evil music\".\n\nThey then began searching for a producer and started recording. They initially considered enlisting [[Ken Andrews]] of [[Failure (band)|Failure]] and [[Ric Ocasek]] of [[the Cars]], but to no avail. They then worked with [[Dan the Automator]] for about a week. According to guitarist [[Stephen Carpenter]], during collaboration with Dan, Deftones seemed to be pursuing the \"more technical\", [[mathcore|math metal]]-based elements of the band's sound. After some deliberation, however, Moreno and drummer [[Abe Cunningham]] successfully pushed for working with producer [[Bob Ezrin]] ([[Pink Floyd]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]) and engineer Brian Virtue.\n\nDeftones then took a short break before planning a month-long tour with [[Dredg]] and C-Minus to road-test some material starting in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], and ending in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], near where Ezrin's studio was located. Recording of the album began in November 2004. During the sessions, tensions mounted within the band and between singer Moreno and producer Ezrin. Moreno eventually jumped ship to continue work on his side project [[Team Sleep]] while the rest of the band continued recording. The Ezrin sessions concluded before [[Christmas]] and the band relocated back to their home base in [[Sacramento]] to take a break.\n\nIn early 2005, Deftones started tweaking the Ezrin material with Virtue at their studio The Spot, writing several new songs in the process. Moreno decided to take a break from recording in the spring to tour with Team Sleep, who were also releasing their long-awaited debut album. Moreno claimed that this was good for him, as he was somewhat unable to focus on the recording sessions due to his [[amphetamine|speed]] and alcohol addictions, as well as the dissolution of his longtime marriage to wife Celeste.\n\n===Hiatus===\nThe rest of the band, while anxious to finish the album, decided it would be best to take a break from music. During the hiatus, Deftones released a 10-year anniversary CD/DVD, titled ''[[B-Sides & Rarities (Deftones album)|B-Sides & Rarities]]'', on October 4, 2005. It included one of the songs from the Virtue sessions, a [[Cover version|cover]] of \"Wax and Wane\" by [[Cocteau Twins]]. In late 2005, Moreno met with Date to help record vocals for some of the remaining tracks. The band also managed to quickly record a cover of [[John Lennon]]'s \"[[Jealous Guy]]\" for [[Amnesty International]] as well as an [[iTunes]] exclusive cover of the Cars' \"[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]\".\n\n===Continuation on production===\nIn early 2006, all previously recorded vocals were scrapped and the band started working on the album again with longtime friend [[Shaun Lopez]] (of [[Far (band)|Far]] and [[the Revolution Smile]]) acting as producer. The album was edited by Ryan Gorman. Finally, with all recording finished in April 2006, the album was mixed by Ryan Williams.\n\nThe album featured musical contributions from [[Annie Hardy]] of [[Giant Drag]] and [[Serj Tankian]] of [[System of a Down]]; the latter also contributed to the writing of one song, \"[[Mein (song)|Mein]]\".\n\nCarpenter stated in interviews that a significant portion of the songs were based on ideas by Moreno and that \"Pink Cellphone\", minus Hardy's vocals, was \"all Chino\". In fact, Moreno plays second guitar on many of the songs, including \"[[Hole in the Earth]]\", \"Beware\", \"Cherry Waves\", \"U,U,D,D,L,R,L,R,A,B,Select,Start\", \"Xerces\" and \"Rivi\u00e8re\". However, Moreno stated that \"Rats!Rats!Rats!\" was \"all Stephen\". Carpenter wrote and recorded all guitar parts on \"Rapture\", \"Rats!Rats!Rats!\" and \"Kimdracula\", but also played guitar and wrote guitar parts for all songs except \"U,U,D,D,L,R,L,R,A,B,Select,Start\", where he played drums and Moreno played guitar. The title for the latter song was a reference to the [[Konami Code]], a famous [[video game]] [[cheat code]].\n\nThe writing and recording process of ''Saturday Night Wrist'' was fraught and placed strain on the relationships within the band. Moreno stated that making it was \"a seriously unhealthy experience\", and that it \"dragged on without much direction\". Following its creation, after leaving to work on Team Sleep, he stated that he \"wasn't sure if [he] was going to return\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Albums for 2008: Deftones | journal = [[Kerrang!]] | issue = 1191 | date = January 5, 2008 | page = 47}}</ref>\n\n==Lyrical themes==\nMoreno described the lyrical subject matter of some of the songs in later interviews. He explained that \"Kimdracula\" was part of his email address at the beginning of making the record, during his heavy drug-use phase. \"Beware\" was a warning to others about sex, drugs and drinking, which were the three main problems he encountered during the album's creation. A story about a witch that Moreno wrote during his drug phase was told in \"Rivi\u00e8re\". \"Cherry Waves\" was about testing the trust a person has in someone else. The confusion Moreno experienced when making ''Saturday Night Wrist'' was illustrated in the song \"Rapture\". Communication issues between the divided band, during the making of the album, were captured in \"Hole in the Earth\".\n\nMoreno explained the record's title as being a reference to the [[Radial neuropathy|nerve damage]] caused when an intoxicated person falls asleep on his or her arm. He elaborated on the title, referencing \"when you're alone on Saturday nights and your only best friend is your shaking wrist\".<ref>Snelling N, \"Deftones\" ''Beat Magazine'' (Australia) Issue 1051, February 14, 2007 at p.28.</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Saturday Night Wrist'' was released on October 31, 2006. It was leaked on the Internet on October 13, over two weeks prior to its release. [[Lead single]] \"Hole in the Earth\" was sent to radio on October 16.\n\nA collection of 16 demos from the Ezrin sessions later became available online, containing rough vocal mixes of \"Cherry Waves\" and \"Combat\", an instrumental version of what would become \"Finger of Death\", and several instrumentals recorded by the band without Moreno that did not make the final cut.\n\nThe [[iTunes]] version included the cover of \"Drive\" by the Cars, which featured producer Lopez as well as a prominent sample of [[Massive Attack]]'s track \"[[Protection (Massive Attack song)|Protection]]\" (from their [[Protection (Massive Attack album)|album of the same name]]).\n{{Album ratings\n| MC         = 72/100<ref name=\"Meta\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/saturday-night-wrist/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Saturday Night Wrist |website=Metacritic |accessdate=2014-07-22}}</ref>\n| rev1       = ''[[The A.V.

They have all the tension and dynamic, all the immediacy of yore, but the mix is spacious, and Chino Moreno's vocals soar above it\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> A less enthusiastic, although positive, review came from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s Christian Hoard, who compared the band's \"[[space rock|space-rock]] overlays\" with [[Radiohead]], but pointed out that \"The songwriting never quite comes

The fast developing city of [[Tiruvallur]] is the district headquarters. The district has a mixture of urban and rural characteristics. The Eastern part of Tiruvallur district is dominated by urban characteristics while the Northern part of the district has influence of Andhra culture due to its position. As of 2011, the district had a population of 3,728,104 with a sex-ratio of 987 females for every 1,000 males\n\nThe district has been divided into three revenue divisions viz, [[Tiruvallur division|Tiruvallur]], [[Tiruttani division|Tiruttani]] and [[Ponneri division|Ponneri]]. There are four taluks under Tiruvallur division, two taluks under [[Tiruttani]] divisions and two taluks under [[Ponneri]] division. There are 46 firkas and 820 revenue villages. Likewise there are 12 blocks, 5 Municipalities and 10 town panchayats which implement rural development activities.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"Tiruvallur\" is supposedly derived from the Tamil sentence \"tiru evvull?\" meaning, \"Tiru\" - Highness (a common prefix in South India for temple towns or cities), \"evvull\" - where do I sleep. So, Tiruvallur means, a place/town where, the god, Veera Raghavar asked a saint for a place to sleep for a night.<ref name=\"tiruvallur official website\">[http://www.tiruvallur.tn.nic.in/history.htm tiruvallur official website]</ref>\n\nTiruvallur  Don Area was originally known as Tiru-evallur which specifies the sleeping position of the holy lord \"Perumal\", in the Veeraragava temple of Tiruvallur. Later people began to refer it by names such as Trivellore and Tiruvallur. Today Tiruvallur is well known, one of the reason being the Veeraragava Temple, where [[Amavasya]] (the commencement of [[dark moon]] prior to the [[new moon]]) is considered an auspicious day for the lord and so for the people of the town.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sri Vaidya Veeraraghava Swami temple - Events|url=http://www.svdtiruvallur.com/events.html|website=www.svdtiruvallur.com}}</ref>\n\nThe district of Tiruvallur has been carved out by bifurcating erstwhile Chengalpattu district (which was renamed as Chengalpattu-MGR/Kancheepuram at the time of 1991 Census). According to the said bifurcation Tiruvallur revenue division which included Tiruvallur, Tiruttani taluks and Uthukkottai and Pallipattu sub-taluks separated from Chengalpattu district along with Ponneri and Gummindipoondi taluks of Saidapet revenue division and formed this new district. At present this district comprises 9 taluks, namely [[Avadi]], [[RK Pet]], [[Ponneri]], [[Gummidipoondi]], [[Uthukottai]], [[Tiruvallur]], [[Poonamallee]], [[Tiruttani]], and [[Pallipattu]].\n\nIn the far past, this region was under a chain of regimes commencing from the Pallavas during the 7th century ending with the Nawab of Arcot during the early part of 19th century when it came under the British rule. In 1687, the Golkonda rulers were defeated and the region came under the Moghul emperors of Delhi. The towns and villages of this region were the scene of Carnatic wars. Battles are said to have been fought in this region during the struggle for supremacy between the English and French. The town of Pulicat was the earliest Dutch possession in India founded in 1609 which was ceded to the British in 1825. With this, the region came under the British rule which ended on 15 August 1947 with India becoming independent.<ref name=\"tiruvallur official website\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nIt is bounded on the north by [[Nellore district]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]] state, on the east by the [[Bay of Bengal]], on the southeast by [[Chennai district]], on the south by [[Kanchipuram district|Kanchipuram]] and [[Chengalpattu district|Chengalpattu]] districts, on the northwest by [[Vellore district|Vellore]] and on the west by [[Ranipet district]].The coastal region of the district is mostly flat and dreary; but in the other parts it is undulating and even hilly in some places.\n\nThe northern taluks of the district like Ponneri, Uttukkottai, Gummidipundi etc. do not have much to offer from the scenic point of view. In the Tiruttani taluk, a number of hillocks are found scattered. The soil of the district is mostly sandy, mixed with soda or other alkali or stony. Rocks found in and near the surface are in detached masses. Hence, the soil can't be termed as very fertile. The soil found nearer the sea coast is of the inferior erinaceous type which is most suited for raising casuarinas plants. No mineral of any importance is available in the district. There are not many hills of any considerable height in this district. A few conical hills or ridges of small elevation exist like the St. Thomas Mount. Certain hillocks are found in Tiruttani. Most of the hills and hillocks are rocky and no verdant vegetation is seen in the slopes of these hills. The area under forests in this district is quite meager.\n\nThe average normal rainfall of the District is 1104&nbsp;mm. Out of which 52% has been received during North East Monsoon period and 41% has been received during South West Monsoon period.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{historical populations|11=1901|12=6,11,211|13=1911|14=6,55,199|15=1921|16=6,88,499|17=1931|18=7,51,567|19=1941|20=8,25,255|21=1951|22=8,88,691|23=1961|24=9,81,733|25=1971|26=12,98,028|27=1981|28=17,18,487|29=1991|30=22,38,583|31=2001|32=27,54,756|33=2011|34=37,28,104|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}According to [[2011 census of India|2011 census]], Thiruvallur district had a population of 3,728,104 with a sex-ratio of 987 females for every 1,000 males, much above the national average of 929.<ref name=\"dashboard\">{{cite web|title=Census Info 2011 Final population totals|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/censusinfodashboard/index.html|publisher=Office of The Registrar General and Census Commissioner, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India|year=2013|accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref> A total of 405,669 were under the age of six, constituting 208,449 males and 197,220 females.

The fast developing city of [[Tiruvallur]] is the district headquarters. The district has a mixture of urban and rural characteristics. The Eastern part of Tiruvallur district is dominated by urban characteristics while the Northern part of the district has influence of Andhra culture due to its position. As of 2011, the district had a population of 3,728,104 with a sex-ratio of 987 females for every 1,000 males\n\nThe district has been divided into three revenue divisions viz, [[Tiruvallur division|Tiruvallur]], [[Tiruttani division|Tiruttani]] and [[Ponneri division|Ponneri]]. There are four taluks under Tiruvallur division, two taluks under [[Tiruttani]] divisions and two taluks under [[Ponneri]] division. There are 46 firkas and 820 revenue villages. Likewise there are 12 blocks, 5 Municipalities and 10 town panchayats which implement rural development activities.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"Tiruvallur\" is supposedly derived from the Tamil sentence \"tiru evvull?\" meaning, \"Tiru\" - Highness (a common prefix in South India for temple towns or cities), \"evvull\" - where do I sleep. So, Tiruvallur means, a place/town where, the god, Veera Raghavar asked a saint for a place to sleep for a night.<ref name=\"tiruvallur official website\">[http://www.tiruvallur.tn.nic.in/history.htm tiruvallur official website]</ref>\n\n\nTiruvallur  Don Area was originally known as Tiru-evallur which specifies the sleeping position of the holy lord \"Perumal\", in the Veeraragava temple of Tiruvallur. Later people began to refer it by names such as Trivellore and Tiruvallur. Today Tiruvallur is well known, one of the reason being the Veeraragava Temple, where [[Amavasya]] (the commencement of [[dark moon]] prior to the [[new moon]]) is considered an auspicious day for the lord and so for the people of the town.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sri Vaidya Veeraraghava Swami temple - Events|url=http://www.svdtiruvallur.com/events.html|website=www.svdtiruvallur.com}}</ref>\n\nThe district of Tiruvallur has been carved out by bifurcating erstwhile Chengalpattu district (which was renamed as Chengalpattu-MGR/Kancheepuram at the time of 1991 Census). According to the said bifurcation Tiruvallur revenue division which included Tiruvallur, Tiruttani taluks and Uthukkottai and Pallipattu sub-taluks separated from Chengalpattu district along with Ponneri and Gummindipoondi taluks of Saidapet revenue division and formed this new district. At present this district comprises 9 taluks, namely [[Avadi]], [[RK Pet]], [[Ponneri]], [[Gummidipoondi]], [[Uthukottai]], [[Tiruvallur]], [[Poonamallee]], [[Tiruttani]], and [[Pallipattu]].\n\nIn the far past, this region was under a chain of regimes commencing from the Pallavas during the 7th century ending with the Nawab of Arcot during the early part of 19th century when it came under the British rule. In 1687, the Golkonda rulers were defeated and the region came under the Moghul emperors of Delhi. The towns and villages of this region were the scene of Carnatic wars. Battles are said to have been fought in this region during the struggle for supremacy between the English and French. The town of Pulicat was the earliest Dutch possession in India founded in 1609 which was ceded to the British in 1825. With this, the region came under the British rule which ended on 15 August 1947 with India becoming independent.<ref name=\"tiruvallur official website\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nIt is bounded on the north by [[Nellore district]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]] state, on the east by the [[Bay of Bengal]], on the southeast by [[Chennai district]], on the south by [[Kanchipuram district|Kanchipuram]] and [[Chengalpattu district|Chengalpattu]] districts, on the northwest by [[Vellore district|Vellore]] and on the west by [[Ranipet district]].The coastal region of the district is mostly flat and dreary; but in the other parts it is undulating and even hilly in some places.\n\nThe northern taluks of the district like Ponneri, Uttukkottai, Gummidipundi etc. do not have much to offer from the scenic point of view. In the Tiruttani taluk, a number of hillocks are found scattered. The soil of the district is mostly sandy, mixed with soda or other alkali or stony. Rocks found in and near the surface are in detached masses. Hence, the soil can't be termed as very fertile. The soil found nearer the sea coast is of the inferior erinaceous type which is most suited for raising casuarinas plants. No mineral of any importance is available in the district. There are not many hills of any considerable height in this district. A few conical hills or ridges of small elevation exist like the St. Thomas Mount. Certain hillocks are found in Tiruttani.
