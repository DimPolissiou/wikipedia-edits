When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond. When MH17 did not respond to several calls, ''Dnipro Control'' contacted ''RND Control'' again to check if they could see the aircraft on their radar.

Lt. Gen. Nikolai Parshin, chief of the Missile and Artillery Directorate, said that after Dutch investigators displayed parts of the missile and their serial numbers, they studied and declassified archives at the research center that produced the Buk missiles. Parshin said the Russian archives show that the missile that was made of these parts was transported to a military unit in western Ukraine in 1986, and to Russia's knowledge never left Ukraine.

The central and rightmost cell are in [[interphase]], thus their entire nuclei are labeled. On the left, a cell is going through [[mitosis]] and its DNA has condensed.]]\n{{Organelle diagram}}\n\nIn [[cell biology]], the '''nucleus''' (pl. '''''nuclei'''''; from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|nucleus}} or {{lang|la|nuculeus}}, meaning ''kernel'' or ''seed'') is a [[biological membrane#Function|membrane-bound]] [[organelle]] found in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cells]]. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian [[red blood cell]]s, have [[#Anucleated_cells|no nuclei]], and a few others including [[osteoclast]]s have [[Multinucleate|many]].\n\nThe cell nucleus contains all of the cell's [[genome]], except for a small fraction of [[mitochondrial DNA]], organized as multiple long linear [[DNA]] molecules in a [[protein complex|complex]] with a large variety of [[protein]]s, such as [[histone]]s, to form [[chromosome]]s. The [[gene]]s within these chromosomes are [[Nuclear organization|structured]] in such a way to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating [[gene expression]]\u2014the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the [[nuclear envelope]], a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular [[cytoplasm]], and the [[nuclear matrix]] (which includes the [[nuclear lamina]]), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the [[cytoskeleton]], which supports the cell as a whole.\n\nBecause the nuclear envelope is impermeable to large molecules, [[nuclear pore]]s are required to regulate [[nuclear transport]] of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a [[Ion channel|channel]] through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and [[ion]]s. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and [[RNA]] through the pores is required for both gene expression and the maintenance of chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound subcompartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of [[nuclear bodies]] exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the [[nucleolus]], which is mainly involved in the assembly of [[ribosome]]s. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate [[mRNA]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Leeuwenhoek1719RedBloodCells.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Oldest known depiction of cells and their nuclei by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], 1719]]\n[[Image:Flemming1882Tafel1Fig14.jpg|thumb|Drawing of a ''[[Chironomus]]'' [[salivary gland]] cell published by [[Walther Flemming]] in 1882. The nucleus contains [[polytene chromosome]]s.\n]]\nThe nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered. What is most likely the oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632\u20131723). He observed a \"lumen\", the nucleus, in the [[red blood cell]]s of [[salmon]].<ref>Leeuwenhoek, A. van: Opera Omnia, seu Arcana Naturae ope exactissimorum Microscopiorum detecta, experimentis variis comprobata, Epistolis ad varios illustres viros.

[[Verlag Harri Deutsch]], Frankfurt am Main, Germany, 2009. {{ISBN|978-3-8171-1781-9}}.</ref> Unlike mammalian red blood cells, those of other vertebrates still contain nuclei.\n\nThe nucleus was also described by [[Franz Bauer]] in 1804<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite book | vauthors =Harris H | title =The Birth of the Cell | edition = | year =1999 | publisher =Yale University Press | location =New Haven | isbn =978-0-300-07384-3 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/birthofcell0000harr }}</ref> and in more detail in 1831 by Scottish [[botanist]] [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]] in a talk at the [[Linnean Society of London]]. Brown was studying [[orchid]]s under the microscope when he observed an opaque area, which he called the \"areola\" or \"nucleus\", in the cells of the flower's outer layer.<ref name=\"Robert Brown\">{{cite journal | last =  Brown | first = Robert | name-list-format = vanc | title = On the Organs and Mode of Fecundation of Orchidex and Asclepiadea | journal = Miscellaneous Botanical Works I | volume =  | pages = 511\u2013514 | year = 1866}}</ref>\n\nHe did not suggest a potential function. In 1838, [[Matthias Schleiden]] proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name \"cytoblast\" (cell builder). He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around \"cytoblasts\". [[Franz Meyen]] was a strong opponent of this view, having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the \"cytoblast\" or otherwise, contradicted work by [[Robert Remak]] (1852) and [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1855) who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells (\"Omnis cellula e cellula\"). The function of the nucleus remained unclear.<ref name=\"Cremer\">{{cite book | last =Cremer| first =Thomas | name-list-format = vanc | title =Von der Zellenlehre zur Chromosomentheorie | edition = | year =1985 | publisher =Springer Verlag | location =Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, Tokyo | isbn = 978-3-540-13987-4}} Online Version [http://www.t-cremer.de/main_de/cremer/personen/info_T_Cremer.htm#book here]</ref>\n\nBetween 1877 and 1878, [[Oscar Hertwig]] published several studies on the [[fertilization]] of [[sea urchin]] eggs, showing that the nucleus of the [[sperm]] enters the [[oocyte]] and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a (single) nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s theory that the complete [[phylogeny]] of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a \"monerula\", a structureless mass of primordial protoplasm (\"[[Urschleim]]\"). Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, including [[amphibians]] and [[molluscs]]. [[Eduard Strasburger]] produced the same results for plants in 1884. This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873, [[August Weismann]] postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ ''cells'' for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after [[mitosis]] was discovered and the [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian rules]] were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the [[chromosome theory of heredity]] was therefore developed.<ref name =\"Cremer\"/>\n\n==Structures==\nThe nucleus is the largest [[organelle]] in animal cells.<ref name=\"Lodish\">{{cite book  | vauthors = Lodish H, Berk A, Matsudaira P, Kaiser CA, Krieger M, Scott MP, Zipursky SL, Darnell J  | title = Molecular Cell Biology  | publisher = WH Freeman  | edition = 5th  | year = 2004  | location = New York  | isbn = 978-0-7167-2672-2  | url-access = registration  | url = https://archive.org/details/studentcompanion0000unse_r7k2  }}</ref>\nIn [[mammal]]ian cells, the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6 [[micrometre]]s (\u00b5m), which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume.<ref name=\"Alberts\">{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=B |title=Molecular biology of the cell |date=2002 |publisher=Garland Science |isbn=978-0815340720 |page=197 |edition=4th}}</ref> The contents of the        \nnucleus are held in the [[nucleoplasm]] similar to the [[cytoplasm]] in the rest of the cell.

The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the [[cell cycle]].\n\nThe nucleus is an [[organelle]] found in eukaryotic cells. Inside its fully enclosed nuclear [[membrane]], it contains the majority of the cell's genetic material. This material is organized as [[DNA]] [[molecules]], along with a variety of [[proteins]], to form [[chromosomes]].\n\n===Cell compartmentalization===\nThe nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of [[glycolysis]], a cellular pathway for breaking down [[glucose]] to produce energy. [[Hexokinase]] is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming [[glucose-6-phosphate]] from glucose. At high concentrations of [[fructose-6-phosphate]], a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus,<ref name=\"Lehninger\">{{cite book | last =Lehninger | first =Albert L. | last2 =Nelson | first2 =David L. | last3 =Cox | first3 =Michael M. | name-list-format =vanc | title =Lehninger principles of biochemistry | edition =3rd | year =2000 | publisher =Worth Publishers | location =New York | isbn =978-1-57259-931-4 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/lehningerprincip01lehn }}</ref> where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.<ref name=\"Moreno\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moreno F, Ahuatzi D, Riera A, Palomino CA, Herrero P | title = Glucose sensing through the Hxk2-dependent signalling pathway | journal = Biochemical Society Transactions | volume = 33 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 265\u20138 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15667322 | doi = 10.1042/BST0330265 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5dc8f56f0c37696164d05edc4a1ea5df6f2b1747 }}</ref>\n\nIn order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some [[transcription factor]] proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of [[NF-\u03baB]]-controlled genes, which are involved in most [[inflammation|inflammatory]] responses, transcription is induced in response to a [[cell signaling|signal pathway]] such as that initiated by the signaling molecule [[TNF-\u03b1]], binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-\u03baB.

They must undergo [[post-transcriptional modification]] in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein [[translation (genetics)|translation]]. The three main modifications are [[5' cap]]ping, 3' [[polyadenylation]], and [[RNA splicing]]. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as [[heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle]]s (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-[[adenine]] tail is only added after transcription is complete.\n\nRNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the [[spliceosome]], is the process by which [[intron]]s, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining [[exon]]s connected to re-form a single continuous molecule.

The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by [[GTPase]]s, enzymes that [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] the molecule [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP) to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is [[Ran (biology)|Ran]], which can bind either GTP or GDP (guanosine diphosphate), depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo.<ref name=\"Pemberton\" />\n\nNuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.\n\nSpecialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' central role in protein translation. Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.<ref name=\"Lodish\" />\n\n===Assembly and disassembly===\n[[File:Mitosis-fluorescent.jpg|thumb|left|230px|An image of a [[newt]] [[lung]] cell [[staining (biology)|stained]] with [[fluorescent]] [[dye]]s during [[metaphase]]. The [[mitotic spindle]] can be seen, stained green, attached to the two sets of [[chromosome]]s, stained light blue. All chromosomes but one are already at the metaphase plate. ]]\n\nDuring its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down or destroyed, either in the process of [[cell division]] or as a consequence of [[apoptosis]] (the process of [[programmed cell death]]). During these events, the structural components of the nucleus&nbsp;\u2014 the envelope and lamina&nbsp;\u2014 can be systematically degraded.\nIn most cells, the disassembly of the nuclear envelope marks the end of the [[prophase]] of [[mitosis]]. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called [[closed mitosis]], in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo [[open mitosis]], which is characterized by breakdown of the nuclear envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.\n\nAt a certain point during the [[cell cycle]] in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the [[sister chromatid]]s, attaching to [[microtubule]]s, which in turn are attached to different [[centrosome]]s. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope.<ref name=\"Lippincott-Schwartz\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lippincott-Schwartz J | title = Cell biology: ripping up the nuclear envelope | journal = Nature | volume = 416 | issue = 6876 | pages = 31\u20132 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11882878 | doi = 10.1038/416031a | bibcode = 2002Natur.416...31L }}</ref> Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in [[prophase]] and until around [[prometaphase]], the nuclear membrane is dismantled.<ref name=\"RGoldman\" /> Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the [[CDC2|CDC2 protein kinase]].<ref name=\"Boulikas\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Boulikas T | title = Phosphorylation of transcription factors and control of the cell cycle | journal = Critical Reviews in Eukaryotic Gene Expression | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201377 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7549180 }}</ref> Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.<ref name=\"Boulikas\" />\n\nHowever, in [[dinoflagellates]], the nuclear envelope remains intact, the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., [[ciliate]]s, [[Apicomplexa|sporozoans]]) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.\n\n[[Apoptosis]] is a controlled process in which the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic [[protease]]s called [[caspase]]s, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in [[assay]]s for early apoptotic activity.<ref name=\"RGoldman\" /> Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus.<ref name=\"RGoldman\" /> Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.<ref name=\"Steen\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Steen RL, Collas P | title = Mistargeting of B-type lamins at the end of mitosis: implications on cell survival and regulation of lamins A/C expression | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 621\u20136 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11331311 | pmc = 2190567 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.153.3.621 }}</ref>\n\nThe nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble.

'''''nuclei'''''; from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|nucleus}} or {{lang|la|nuculeus}}, meaning ''kernel'' or ''seed'') is a [[biological membrane#Function|membrane-bound]] [[organelle]] found in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cells]]. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian [[red blood cell]]s, have [[#Anucleated_cells|no nuclei]], and a few others including [[osteoclast]]s have [[Multinucleate|many]].\n\nThe cell nucleus contains all of the cell's [[genome]], except for a small fraction of [[mitochondrial DNA]], organized as multiple long linear [[DNA]] molecules in a [[protein complex|complex]] with a large variety of [[protein]]s, such as [[histone]]s, to form [[chromosome]]s. The [[gene]]s within these chromosomes are [[Nuclear organization|structured]] in such a way to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating [[gene expression]]\u2014the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the [[nuclear envelope]], a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular [[cytoplasm]], and the [[nuclear matrix]] (which includes the [[nuclear lamina]]), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the [[cytoskeleton]], which supports the cell as a whole.\n\nBecause the nuclear envelope is impermeable to large molecules, [[nuclear pore]]s are required to regulate [[nuclear transport]] of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a [[Ion channel|channel]] through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and [[ion]]s. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and [[RNA]] through the pores is required for both gene expression and the maintenance of chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound subcompartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of [[nuclear bodies]] exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the [[nucleolus]], which is mainly involved in the assembly of [[ribosome]]s. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate [[mRNA]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Leeuwenhoek1719RedBloodCells.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Oldest known depiction of cells and their nuclei by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], 1719]]\n[[Image:Flemming1882Tafel1Fig14.jpg|thumb|Drawing of a ''[[Chironomus]]'' [[salivary gland]] cell published by [[Walther Flemming]] in 1882.

In 1838, [[Matthias Schleiden]] proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name \"cytoblast\" (cell builder). He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around \"cytoblasts\". [[Franz Meyen]] was a strong opponent of this view, having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the \"cytoblast\" or otherwise, contradicted work by [[Robert Remak]] (1852) and [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1855) who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells (\"Omnis cellula e cellula\"). The function of the nucleus remained unclear.<ref name=\"Cremer\">{{cite book | last =Cremer| first =Thomas | name-list-format = vanc | title =Von der Zellenlehre zur Chromosomentheorie | edition = | year =1985 | publisher =Springer Verlag | location =Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, Tokyo | isbn = 978-3-540-13987-4}} Online Version [http://www.t-cremer.de/main_de/cremer/personen/info_T_Cremer.htm#book here]</ref>\n\nBetween 1877 and 1878, [[Oscar Hertwig]] published several studies on the [[fertilization]] of [[sea urchin]] eggs, showing that the nucleus of the [[sperm]] enters the [[oocyte]] and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a (single) nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s theory that the complete [[phylogeny]] of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a \"monerula\", a structureless mass of primordial protoplasm (\"[[Urschleim]]\"). Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, including [[amphibians]] and [[molluscs]]. [[Eduard Strasburger]] produced the same results for plants in 1884. This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873, [[August Weismann]] postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ ''cells'' for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after [[mitosis]] was discovered and the [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian rules]] were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the [[chromosome theory of heredity]] was therefore developed.<ref name =\"Cremer\"/>\n\n==Structures==\nThe nucleus is the largest [[organelle]] in animal cells.<ref name=\"Lodish\">{{cite book  | vauthors = Lodish H, Berk A, Matsudaira P, Kaiser CA, Krieger M, Scott MP, Zipursky SL, Darnell J  | title = Molecular Cell Biology  | publisher = WH Freeman  | edition = 5th  | year = 2004  | location = New York  | isbn = 978-0-7167-2672-2  | url-access = registration  | url = https://archive.org/details/studentcompanion0000unse_r7k2  }}</ref>\nIn [[mammal]]ian cells, the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6 [[micrometre]]s (\u00b5m), which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume.<ref name=\"Alberts\">{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=B |title=Molecular biology of the cell |date=2002 |publisher=Garland Science |isbn=978-0815340720 |page=197 |edition=4th}}</ref> The contents of the        \nnucleus are held in the [[nucleoplasm]] similar to the [[cytoplasm]] in the rest of the cell.

The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the [[cell cycle]].\n\nThe nucleus is an [[organelle]] found in eukaryotic cells. Inside its fully enclosed nuclear [[membrane]], it contains the majority of the cell's genetic material. This material is organized as [[DNA]] [[molecules]], along with a variety of [[proteins]], to form [[chromosomes]].\n\n===Cell compartmentalization===\nThe nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of [[glycolysis]], a cellular pathway for breaking down [[glucose]] to produce energy. [[Hexokinase]] is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming [[glucose-6-phosphate]] from glucose. At high concentrations of [[fructose-6-phosphate]], a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus,<ref name=\"Lehninger\">{{cite book | last =Lehninger | first =Albert L. | last2 =Nelson | first2 =David L. | last3 =Cox | first3 =Michael M. | name-list-format =vanc | title =Lehninger principles of biochemistry | edition =3rd | year =2000 | publisher =Worth Publishers | location =New York | isbn =978-1-57259-931-4 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/lehningerprincip01lehn }}</ref> where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.<ref name=\"Moreno\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moreno F, Ahuatzi D, Riera A, Palomino CA, Herrero P | title = Glucose sensing through the Hxk2-dependent signalling pathway | journal = Biochemical Society Transactions | volume = 33 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 265\u20138 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15667322 | doi = 10.1042/BST0330265 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5dc8f56f0c37696164d05edc4a1ea5df6f2b1747 }}</ref>\n\nIn order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some [[transcription factor]] proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of [[NF-\u03baB]]-controlled genes, which are involved in most [[inflammation|inflammatory]] responses, transcription is induced in response to a [[cell signaling|signal pathway]] such as that initiated by the signaling molecule [[TNF-\u03b1]], binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-\u03baB.

They must undergo [[post-transcriptional modification]] in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein [[translation (genetics)|translation]]. The three main modifications are [[5' cap]]ping, 3' [[polyadenylation]], and [[RNA splicing]]. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as [[heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle]]s (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-[[adenine]] tail is only added after transcription is complete.\n\nRNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the [[spliceosome]], is the process by which [[intron]]s, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining [[exon]]s connected to re-form a single continuous molecule.

The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by [[GTPase]]s, enzymes that [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] the molecule [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP) to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is [[Ran (biology)|Ran]], which can bind either GTP or GDP (guanosine diphosphate), depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo.<ref name=\"Pemberton\" />\n\nNuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.\n\nSpecialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' central role in protein translation. Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.<ref name=\"Lodish\" />\n\n===Assembly and disassembly===\n[[File:Mitosis-fluorescent.jpg|thumb|left|230px|An image of a [[newt]] [[lung]] cell [[staining (biology)|stained]] with [[fluorescent]] [[dye]]s during [[metaphase]]. The [[mitotic spindle]] can be seen, stained green, attached to the two sets of [[chromosome]]s, stained light blue. All chromosomes but one are already at the metaphase plate. ]]\n\nDuring its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down or destroyed, either in the process of [[cell division]] or as a consequence of [[apoptosis]] (the process of [[programmed cell death]]). During these events, the structural components of the nucleus&nbsp;\u2014 the envelope and lamina&nbsp;\u2014 can be systematically degraded.\nIn most cells, the disassembly of the nuclear envelope marks the end of the [[prophase]] of [[mitosis]]. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called [[closed mitosis]], in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo [[open mitosis]], which is characterized by breakdown of the nuclear envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.\n\nAt a certain point during the [[cell cycle]] in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the [[sister chromatid]]s, attaching to [[microtubule]]s, which in turn are attached to different [[centrosome]]s. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope.<ref name=\"Lippincott-Schwartz\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lippincott-Schwartz J | title = Cell biology: ripping up the nuclear envelope | journal = Nature | volume = 416 | issue = 6876 | pages = 31\u20132 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11882878 | doi = 10.1038/416031a | bibcode = 2002Natur.416...31L }}</ref> Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in [[prophase]] and until around [[prometaphase]], the nuclear membrane is dismantled.<ref name=\"RGoldman\" /> Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the [[CDC2|CDC2 protein kinase]].<ref name=\"Boulikas\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Boulikas T | title = Phosphorylation of transcription factors and control of the cell cycle | journal = Critical Reviews in Eukaryotic Gene Expression | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201377 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7549180 }}</ref> Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.<ref name=\"Boulikas\" />\n\nHowever, in [[dinoflagellates]], the nuclear envelope remains intact, the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., [[ciliate]]s, [[Apicomplexa|sporozoans]]) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.\n\n[[Apoptosis]] is a controlled process in which the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic [[protease]]s called [[caspase]]s, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in [[assay]]s for early apoptotic activity.<ref name=\"RGoldman\" /> Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus.<ref name=\"RGoldman\" /> Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.<ref name=\"Steen\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Steen RL, Collas P | title = Mistargeting of B-type lamins at the end of mitosis: implications on cell survival and regulation of lamins A/C expression | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 621\u20136 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11331311 | pmc = 2190567 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.153.3.621 }}</ref>\n\nThe nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as [[herpesvirus]] replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.<ref name=\"RGoldman\" />\n\n===Disease-related dynamics===\nInitially, it has been suspected that [[immunoglobulins]] in general and [[autoantibodies]] in particular do not enter the nucleus. Now there is a body of evidence that under pathological conditions (e.g. [[lupus erythematosus]]) IgG can enter the nucleus.<ref>B\u00f6hm I.

The best-known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell, or [[erythrocyte]], which also lacks other organelles such as [[mitochondria]], and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry [[oxygen]] from the [[lungs]] to the body's tissues. Erythrocytes mature through [[erythropoiesis]] in the [[bone marrow]], where they lose their nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes.
