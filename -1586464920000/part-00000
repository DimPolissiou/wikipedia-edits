His thesis <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/theses/theses30-96.html|title=U of Toronto Astronomy Department Theses 1930\u20131996}}</ref> was based on [[microwave]] surveys of selected emission nebulae in the northern [[Milky Way]] made with the 46-m radio telescope of the [[Algonquin Radio Observatory]], including the emission nebula IC1795.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141224.html|title=IC 1795}}</ref> This revealed what is perhaps the youngest stellar object in the Galaxy, namely W3(OH), a cocoon star <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Development of a Cocoon Star|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|volume=6|issue=3|pages=422\u2013435|doi=10.1007/BF00653862|year=1970|last1=Davidson|first1=Kris|bibcode=1970Ap&SS...6..422D}}</ref> invisible at optical wavelengths but surrounded by a rapidly expanding ultracompact HII region, all within a dense obscuring dust shell. W3(OH) had previously been located in 1966 as the source of the first radio-identified [[astrophysical maser]].\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1968 he joined the staff of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory as scientific assistant to the Director.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rasc.ca/christopher-aikman|title=Christopher Aikman {{!}} RASC|website=www.rasc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref> His initial research was on the [[spectroscopy]] of comets, and of chemically peculiar stars whose surface compositions differ markedly from that of the [[Sun]], with the aim of understanding the origin of their anomalies. This led to the discovery of a chemically peculiar star, HR 7775, having extraordinary enhancements of the element gold in its atmosphere.\n\nFrom 1991, he conducted a program of tracking [[Near-Earth asteroid|Earth approaching asteroids]] with the historic telescope built by [[John S. Plaskett]], but the project was cancelled in 1997.\n\nHe was the Canadian representative on the [[Spaceguard]] Foundation, a group concerned with assessing the [[asteroid]] impact threat to [[Earth]]. An incidental product of this research was the discovery of four asteroids between 1994 and 1998 (as credited by the [[Minor Planet Center]]).<ref name=\"MPC-Discoverers\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"MPC-Discoverers\">{{cite web\n  |title      = Minor Planet Discoverers (by number)\n  |work       = Minor Planet Center\n  |url        = https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/MPDiscsNum.html\n  |date       = 24 February 2016\n  |accessdate = 19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"springer-Hendrika\">{{cite book\n  |title      = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names \u2013 (7840) Hendrika\n  |last       = Schmadel | first = Lutz D.\n  |publisher  = [[Springer Berlin Heidelberg]]\n  |chapter    = (7840) Hendrika \n  |page       = 618\n  |date       = 2007\n  |isbn       = 978-3-540-00238-3\n  |doi        = 10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_6700}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MPC-Hendrika\">{{cite web\n  |title      = 7840 Hendrika (1994 TL3)\n  |work       = Minor Planet Center\n  |url        = https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=7840\n  |accessdate = 19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"springer-Gwendolen\">{{cite book\n  |title      = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names \u2013 (10870) Gwendolen\n  |last       = Schmadel | first = Lutz D.\n  |publisher  = Springer Berlin Heidelberg\n  |chapter    = (10870) Gwendolen \n  |page       = 747\n  |date       = 2007\n  |isbn       = 978-3-540-00238-3\n  |doi        = 10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_8151}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MPC-Gwendolen\">{{cite web\n  |title      = 10870 Gwendolen (1996 SY4)\n  |work       = Minor Planet Center\n  |url        = https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=10870\n  |accessdate = 19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"springer-Dominiona\">{{cite book\n  |title      = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names \u2013 (24899) Dominiona\n  |last       = Schmadel | first = Lutz D.\n  |publisher  = Springer Berlin Heidelberg\n  |chapter    = (24899) Dominiona \n  |page       = 875\n  |date       = 2007\n  |isbn       = 978-3-540-00238-3\n  |doi        = 10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_9790}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MPC-Dominiona\">{{cite web\n  |title      = 24899 Dominiona (1997 AU17)\n  |work       = Minor Planet Center\n  |url        = https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=24899\n  |accessdate = 19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MPC-Slocum\">{{cite web\n  |title      = 246913 Slocum (1998 SU63)\n  |work       = Minor Planet Center\n  |url        = https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=246913\n  |accessdate = 19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n}} <!-- end of reflist -->\n\n==Selected publications ==\n* {{Cite journal\n | last = Aikman | first = G.C.\n |author2=Macrae, Donald A.\n| title = Radio Components of IC 1795\n | journal = Astronomical Journal\n | year = 1968\n | volume = 73\n | pages = S1\n | bibcode = 1968AJS....73S...1A\n}}\n* {{Cite journal\n | last = Aikman | first = G.C.L\n |author2=Balfour, W.\n |author3=Tatum, J.

Research Council Canada]] in [[Saanich, British Columbia]], Canada.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAn early interest in astronomy led Aikman to join the [[Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]] Quebec Centre in 1958, at the age of 15. \n\nHe received a B.Sc. from [[Bishop's University]] in 1965 and a M.Sc. from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1968. His thesis <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/theses/theses30-96.html|title=U of Toronto Astronomy Department Theses 1930-1996}}</ref> was based on [[microwave]] surveys of selected emission nebulae in the northern [[Milky Way]] made with the 46-m radio telescope of the [[Algonquin Radio Observatory]], including the emission nebula IC1795.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141224.html|title=IC 1795}}</ref> This revealed what is perhaps the youngest stellar object in the Galaxy, namely W3(OH), a cocoon star <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Development of a Cocoon Star|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|volume=6|issue=3|pages=422\u2013435|doi=10.1007/BF00653862|year=1970|last1=Davidson|first1=Kris|bibcode=1970Ap&SS...6..422D}}</ref> invisible at optical wavelengths but surrounded by a rapidly expanding ultracompact HII region, all within a dense obscuring dust shell. W3(OH) had previously been located in 1966 as the source of the first radio-identified [[astrophysical maser]].\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1968 he joined the staff of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory as scientific assistant to the Director.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rasc.ca/christopher-aikman|title=Christopher Aikman {{!}} RASC|website=www.rasc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref> His initial research was on the [[spectroscopy]] of comets, and of chemically peculiar stars whose surface compositions differ markedly from that of the [[Sun]], with the aim of understanding the origin of their anomalies. This lead to the discovery of a chemically peculiar star, HR 7775, having extraordinary enhancements of the element gold in its atmosphere.\n\nFrom 1991, he conducted a program of tracking [[Near-Earth asteroid|Earth approaching asteroids]] with the historic telescope built by [[John S. Plaskett]], but the project was cancelled in 1997.\n\nHe was the Canadian representative on the [[Spaceguard]] Foundation, a group concerned with assessing the [[asteroid]] impact threat to [[Earth]]. An incidental product of this research was the discovery of four asteroids between 1994 and 1998 (as credited by the [[Minor Planet Center]]).<ref name=\"MPC-Discoverers\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"MPC-Discoverers\">{{cite web\n  |title      = Minor Planet Discoverers (by number)\n  |work       = Minor Planet Center\n  |url        = https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/MPDiscsNum.html\n  |date       = 24 February 2016\n  |accessdate = 19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"springer-Hendrika\">{{cite book\n  |title      = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names \u2013 (7840) Hendrika\n  |last       = Schmadel | first = Lutz D.\n  |publisher  = [[Springer Berlin Heidelberg]]\n  |chapter    = (7840) Hendrika \n  |page       = 618\n  |date       = 2007\n  |isbn       = 978-3-540-00238-3\n  |doi        = 10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_6700}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MPC-Hendrika\">{{cite web\n  |title      = 7840 Hendrika (1994 TL3)\n  |work       = Minor Planet Center\n  |url        = https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=7840\n  |accessdate = 19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"springer-Gwendolen\">{{cite book\n  |title      = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names \u2013 (10870) Gwendolen\n  |last       = Schmadel | first = Lutz D.\n  |publisher  = Springer Berlin Heidelberg\n  |chapter    = (10870) Gwendolen \n  |page       = 747\n  |date       = 2007\n  |isbn       = 978-3-540-00238-3\n  |doi        = 10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_8151}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MPC-Gwendolen\">{{cite web\n  |title      = 10870 Gwendolen (1996 SY4)\n  |work       = Minor Planet Center\n  |url        = https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=10870\n  |accessdate = 19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"springer-Dominiona\">{{cite book\n  |title      = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names \u2013 (24899) Dominiona\n  |last       = Schmadel | first = Lutz D.\n  |publisher  = Springer Berlin Heidelberg\n  |chapter    = (24899) Dominiona \n  |page       = 875\n  |date       = 2007\n  |isbn       = 978-3-540-00238-3\n  |doi        = 10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_9790}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MPC-Dominiona\">{{cite web\n  |title      = 24899 Dominiona (1997 AU17)\n  |work       = Minor Planet Center\n  |url        = https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=24899\n  |accessdate = 19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MPC-Slocum\">{{cite web\n  |title      = 246913 Slocum (1998 SU63)\n  |work       = Minor Planet Center\n  |url        = https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=246913\n  |accessdate = 19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n}} <!-- end of reflist -->\n\n==Selected Publications ==\n* {{Cite journal\n | last = Aikman | first = G.C.\n |author2=Macrae, Donald A.\n| title = Radio Components of IC 1795\n | journal = Astronomical Journal\n | year = 1968\n | volume = 73\n | pages = S1\n | bibcode = 1968AJS....73S...1A\n}}\n* {{Cite journal\n | last = Aikman | first = G.C.L\n |author2=Balfour, W.\n |author3=Tatum, J.

With five [[national parks]] ([[Arches National Park|Arches]], [[Bryce Canyon]], [[Canyonlands]], [[Capitol Reef]], and [[Zion National Park|Zion]]), Utah has the third most national parks of any state after [[Alaska]] and [[California]]. In addition, Utah features seven national monuments, two [[national recreation area]]s, six [[United States National Forest|national forests]], and numerous state parks and monuments.\n\nUtah is well known for its winter activities and has seen an increase in tourism since the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. Beginning in 1939, with the establishment of [[Alta Ski Area]], [[Development of Skiing in Utah|Utah's skiing]] has become world-renowned. [[Park City, Utah|Park City]] is home to the [[United States Ski Team]]. Utah's ski resorts are primarily located in northern Utah near Salt Lake City, Park City, [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]].

Several facilities were built to accommodate the influx of tourism that accompanied and lingered after the Olympics. Former Olympic venues including [[Utah Olympic Park]] and [[Utah Olympic Oval]] are still in operation for training and competition and allows the public to participate in numerous activities including [[ski jumping]], [[bobsleigh]], and [[speed skating]].\n\nUtah features many cultural attractions such as [[Temple Square]] in Salt Lake, the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in Park City, and the [[Utah Shakespearean Festival]] in Cedar City.\n\nOther attractions include [[Monument Valley]], the [[Great Salt Lake]], the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]], and [[Lake Powell]].\n\n==Mining==\n[[File:Bingham Canyon April 2005.jpg|thumb|left|Bingham Canyon Mine southwest of Salt Lake City.]]\nBeginning in the late 19th century with the state's mining boom (including the [[Bingham Canyon Mine]], among the world's largest open pit mines), companies attracted large numbers of immigrants with job opportunities. Since the days of the [[Utah Territory]] mining has played a major role in Utah's economy. Historical mining towns include [[Mercur, Utah|Mercur]] in Tooele County, [[Silver Reef, Utah|Silver Reef]] in Washington County, [[Eureka, Utah|Eureka]] in Juab County, [[Park City, Utah|Park City]] in Summit County and numerous coal mining camps throughout Carbon County such as Castle Gate, Spring Canyon, and Hiawatha.  These settlements were characteristic of the boom and bust cycle that dominated mining towns of the American West. During the early part of the [[Cold War]] era, uranium was mined in eastern Utah. Today mining activity still plays a major role in the state's economy. Minerals mined in Utah include copper, gold, silver, molybdenum, zinc, lead, and beryllium. Fossil fuels including coal, petroleum, and natural gas continue to play a major role in Utah's economy, especially in the eastern part of the state in counties such as Carbon, Emery, Grand, and Uintah.<ref>Utah Department of Community and Culture, Mining Heritage Alliance, [http://history.utah.gov/mining_heritage_alliance/highlights.html Highlights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117095118/http://history.utah.gov/mining_heritage_alliance/highlights.html |date=2013-01-17 }} as found at Utah.gov</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Utah}}\n{{United States topic\n|title  = [[Economy of the United States]]\n|prefix = Economy of\n|exclude-wdc = y\n|exclude-isl = y\n\n}}\n\n[[Category:Economy of Utah]]\n", "text_old": "The '''economy of Utah''' is a diversified economy covering industries such as [[tourism]], [[mining]], [[agriculture]], manufacturing, [[information technology]], [[finance]], and [[Oil refining|petroleum production]].

With five [[national parks]] ([[Arches National Park|Arches]], [[Bryce Canyon]], [[Canyonlands]], [[Capitol Reef]], and [[Zion National Park|Zion]]), Utah has the third most national parks of any state after [[Alaska]] and [[California]]. In addition, Utah features seven national monuments, two [[national recreation area]]s, six [[United States National Forest|national forests]], and numerous state parks and monuments.\n\nUtah is well known for its winter activities and has seen an increase in tourism since the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. Beginning in 1939, with the establishment of [[Alta Ski Area]], [[Development of Skiing in Utah|Utah's skiing]] has become world-renowned. [[Park City, Utah|Park City]] is home to the [[United States Ski Team]]. Utah's ski resorts are primarily located in northern Utah near Salt Lake City, Park City, [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]]. In 2008, for a second year in a row, [[Deer Valley]], in Park City, was ranked the top ski resort in [[North America]] by more than 20,000 subscribers of Ski Magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deervalley.com/about_deervalley/press_room/current_press_releases/deer-valley-resort-ranked-1-ski-area-in-north-am.html|title=Deer Valley Resort Press Room|website=Deervalley.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}</ref> In addition to having prime snow conditions and world-class amenities, Northern Utah's ski resorts are well liked among tourists for their convenience and proximity to a large city and [[Salt Lake City International Airport|International Airport]], as well as the close proximity to other ski resorts, allowing skiers the ability to ski at multiple locations in one day. \n\nThe [[2002 Winter Olympics]] were celebrated in Utah and offered a great boon to the economy of the state. Several facilities were built to accommodate the influx of tourism that accompanied and lingered after the Olympics. Former Olympic venues including [[Utah Olympic Park]] and [[Utah Olympic Oval]] are still in operation for training and competition and allows the public to participate in numerous activities including [[ski jumping]], [[bobsleigh]], and [[speed skating]].\n\nUtah features many cultural attractions such as [[Temple Square]] in Salt Lake, the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in Park City, and the [[Utah Shakespearean Festival]] in Cedar City.\n\nOther attractions include [[Monument Valley]], the [[Great Salt Lake]], the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]], and [[Lake Powell]].\n\n==Mining==\n[[File:Bingham Canyon April 2005.jpg|thumb|left|Bingham Canyon Mine southwest of Salt Lake City.]]\nBeginning in the late 19th century with the state's mining boom (including the [[Bingham Canyon Mine]], among the world's largest open pit mines), companies attracted large numbers of immigrants with job opportunities. Since the days of the [[Utah Territory]] mining has played a major role in Utah's economy. Historical mining towns include [[Mercur, Utah|Mercur]] in Tooele County, [[Silver Reef, Utah|Silver Reef]] in Washington County, [[Eureka, Utah|Eureka]] in Juab County, [[Park City, Utah|Park City]] in Summit County and numerous coal mining camps throughout Carbon County such as Castle Gate, Spring Canyon, and Hiawatha.  These settlements were characteristic of the boom and bust cycle that dominated mining towns of the American West. During the early part of the [[Cold War]] era, uranium was mined in eastern Utah. Today mining activity still plays a major role in the state's economy. Minerals mined in Utah include copper, gold, silver, molybdenum, zinc, lead, and beryllium. Fossil fuels including coal, petroleum, and natural gas continue to play a major role in Utah's economy, especially in the eastern part of the state in counties such as Carbon, Emery, Grand, and Uintah.<ref>Utah Department of Community and Culture, Mining Heritage Alliance, [http://history.utah.gov/mining_heritage_alliance/highlights.html Highlights] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117095118/http://history.utah.gov/mining_heritage_alliance/highlights.html |date=2013-01-17 }} as found at Utah.gov</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Utah}}\n{{United States topic\n|title  = [[Economy of the United States]]\n|prefix = Economy of\n|exclude-wdc = y\n|exclude-isl = y\n\n}}\n\n[[Category:Economy of Utah]]\n", "name_user": "2605:e000:3e8c:f00:60ef:9c22:6da2:6097", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFarming)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Utah"}

{"title_page": "William Kennish", "text_new": "'''William Kennish''' (born 1799, in [[Maughold (parish)|Maughold]], [[Isle of Man]], died, March 19, 1862 in [[New York City]]), was an engineer, inventor, explorer, scientist, and poet, known primarily for inventions developed while he served in the [[British Royal Navy]] (1821-1841). They ranged from improvements for artillery to navigation and steering devices.\n\nAfter retiring from the Navy, Kennish worked as a schoolteacher on the Isle of Man. But in 1849,  he  immigrated to the United States for more opportunities. He began surveying gold lands in Colombia, [[South America]], for firms based in New York City. In 1855 he completed a report on a potential river acqueduct or canal across the northwest isthmus of present-day [[Colombia]], using the [[Atrato River]] and emptying into [[Bahia Humboldt, Choc\u00f3]] and the Pacific Ocean. That year Congress approved a joint military expedition of a US Navy and Army party to explore this, and Kennish acted as their guide. He later died in New York.\n\n==Life==\nKennish was born in the Parish of Maughold, on the [[Isle of Man]], in a cottage at Cornaa on the Douglas-Ramsey Road.  His parents were farmers, and he learned farming from his father. He grew up speaking [[Manx language|Manx]] as his first language. He knew very little English until after he became a seaman in the [[Royal Navy]] at the age of 22.  He learned English and rose to the rank of Master Carpenter by the time he was 27. In October 1826, he married Mary Byford, of Gillingham, [[Chatham, Kent]], England.<ref name=mw>[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/worthies/p118.htm A. W. Moore, Chap. 6: ''Manx Worthies or Biographies of Notable Manx Men and Women'', pp. 188-121, Douglas, Isle of Man: S.K. Broadbent & Co., 1901</ref>\n\nBetween 1827 and 1832, while in the service of the Royal Navy, he invented a system (\"A Method for Concentrating the Fire of a Broadside\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kennish|first1=William|title=A Method For concentrating the Fire of A Broadside of a ship of War|date=1832|publisher=John Bradley|location=London|isbn=|pages=1\u201348 and 30 plates}}</ref>) for improving the aiming of naval artillery. Other inventions included a fuze for a shell, and a system for floating naval artillery to shore for land use. He invented a marine [[theodolite]], which was a key element of his improved method. He proposed the practice of painting naval vessels grey to reduce the distortion and decay caused by solar radiation on black-painted timbers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kennish|first1=William|title=On the Disadvantages that attend the use of black paint on board ship|journal=Transactions, Royal Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce|date=1840|volume=53|issue=Part 1 (1837-1838)|pages=101\u2013104}}</ref> He also worked on creating an artificial horizon for navigation; a[n] automatic depth-sounding instrument; a method of drowning the magazine of a ship of war; an hydraulic ventilator; [and] a hydrostatic diving machine[.]<ref name=mw/>\n\nWhen the Royal Navy became interested in [[steam propulsion]], between 1832 and 1840, Kennish designed several steam engines and an early [[screw propeller]]; but the Royal Navy did not take up his ideas.

They ranged from improvements for artillery to navigation and steering devices.\n\nAfter retiring from the Navy, Kennish worked as a schoolteacher on the Isle of Man. But in 1849,  he  immigrated to the United States for more opportunities. He began surveying gold lands in Colombia, [[South America]], for firms based in New York City. In 1855 he completed a report on a potential river acqueduct or canal across the northwest isthmus of present-day [[Colombia]], using the [[Atrato River]] and emptying into [[Bahia Humboldt, Choc\u00f3]] and the Pacific Ocean. That year Congress approved a joint military expedition of a US Navy and Army party to explore this, and Kennish acted as their guide. He later died in New York. \n\n==Life==\nKennish was born in the Parish of Maughold, on the [[Isle of Man]], in a cottage at Cornaa on the Douglas-Ramsey Road.  His parents were farmers, and he learned farming from his father. He grew up speaking [[Manx language|Manx]] as his first language. He knew very little English until after he became a seaman in the [[Royal Navy]] at the age of 22.  He learned English and rose to the rank of Master Carpenter by the time he was 27. In October 1826, he married Mary Byford, of Gillingham, [[Chatham, Kent]], England.<ref name=mw>[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/worthies/p118.htm A. W.

Other inventions included a fuze for a shell, and a system for floating naval artillery to shore for land use. He invented a marine [[theodolite]], which was a key element of his improved method.

He is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and served in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from 1997 to 2007, representing [[Florida's 11th congressional district]]. He was the Democratic nominee for [[governor of Florida]] in the [[Florida gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 election]], but was defeated by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Charlie Crist]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{New Democrats}}\nDavis was born in [[Tampa, Florida]]. He graduated from [[Jesuit High School of Tampa]] in 1975, and attended [[Washington and Lee University]], where he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1979. He later attended the [[University of Florida|University of Florida's]] [[Levin College of Law|College of Law]], received his [[Juris Doctor]] in 1982. He later credited his grandfather as an important influence on his life.\n\n==Career==\nDavis worked as a lawyer in private practice from 1982 to 1988, when he became a partner in the Tampa-based business [[law firm]] of Bush, Ross, Gardner, Warren & Rudy. Davis was elected to the [[Florida House of Representatives]] in 1989 and served until 1996, serving as [[Majority leader|House Majority Leader]] from 1995 to 1996.\n\n==US House==\nDavis entered the race for the Tampa-based 11th District in 1996, after [[Sam Gibbons]]\u2014the district's only congressman since its creation in 1963\u2014announced his retirement.  Although Gibbons had endorsed Davis as his successor, Davis finished second in a four-way Democratic primary behind former Tampa mayor [[Sandra W. Freedman|Sandy Freedman]].  He won the runoff with 56 percent of the vote.\n \nHe faced Republican Mark Sharpe in the general election.  The race was initially thought to be close, especially since Sharpe had nearly defeated Gibbons in 1994 and held him to 52 percent in 1992.  However, Davis won by a convincing 15-point margin, largely due to [[Bill Clinton]] carrying the district.  After defeating an underfunded Republican in 1998, Davis faced only a Libertarian candidate in 2000 and 2004 and was completely unopposed in 2002.\n\nDavis was one of the co-chairs of the [[New Democrat Coalition]] in the House of Representatives. The New Democrat Coalition is affiliated with the centrist [[Democratic Leadership Council]].\n\nOn October 10, 2002, Jim Davis was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].\n\n==2006 Gubernatorial Campaign==\n[[File:U.S. Representative and gubernatorial candidate Jim Davis speaking at a campaign rally in Wilton Manors.jpg|thumb|right|Davis campaigning in [[Wilton Manors, Florida|Wilton Manors]]]]\nDavis announced his candidacy for governor of Florida in 2005 and won the Democratic primary held on September 5, 2006. He defeated then-state Senator [[Rod Smith (politician)|Rod Smith]] by a margin of 46 percent to 42 percent.\n\nHe received the endorsements of former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], U.S. senator for Florida [[Bill Nelson]], U.S. senator for Illinois [[Barack Obama]], former Governor and U.S. Senator [[Bob Graham]], former Governor [[Buddy MacKay]], former First Lady Rhea Chiles (wife of [[Lawton Chiles]]), former Tallahassee mayor and [[Florida Democratic Party]] chairman [[Scott Maddox]], Miami-Dade Democratic Party chairman Jimmy Morales, and Representatives [[Alcee Hastings]], [[Robert Wexler]], [[Corrine Brown]], and [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]].\n\nHe lost the race to Attorney General [[Charlie Crist]] by a margin of 52-45.\n\n==Post-political career==\n{{As of|2007}}, Davis is employed at [[Holland & Knight]] in Tampa. In 2010, Davis has been a member of and public speaker for Moving Hillsborough Forward, an organization formed to help pass a transit tax referendum on the 2010 general election ballot in [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]].\n\nIn 2010, Davis was a member of and public speaker for Moving Hillsborough Forward, an organization formed to help pass a transit tax referendum on the general election ballot in [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]].<ref>Robert Napper, \"Powerful Tampa Bay Interests Campaign for Local Light Rail Funding,\" Moving Hillsborough Forward, under \"News & Media,\" August 2, 2010, http://www.movinghillsboroughforward.org/news-media/powerful-tampa-bay-interests-campaign-for-local-light-rail-funding.aspx{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Though there was some speculation that he might potentially run for Mayor of Tampa in 2011,<ref>Mike Deeson, \"Tampa Mayor Race Gets Hotter: Bob Buckhorn is Running,\" WTSP 10 News, June 2010, http://www.wtsp.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=131766{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> he ultimately declined to run.

He is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and served in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from 1997 to 2007, representing [[Florida's 11th congressional district]]. He was the Democratic nominee for [[governor of Florida]] in the [[Florida gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 election]], but was defeated by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Charlie Crist]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{New Democrats}}\nDavis was born in [[Tampa, Florida]]. He graduated from [[Jesuit High School of Tampa]] in 1975, and attended [[Washington and Lee University]], where he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1979. He later attended the [[University of Florida|University of Florida's]] [[Levin College of Law|College of Law]], received his [[Juris Doctor]] in 1982. He later credited his grandfather as an important influence on his life.\n\n==Career==\nDavis worked as a lawyer in private practice from 1982 to 1988, when he became a partner in the Tampa-based business [[law firm]] of Bush, Ross, Gardner, Warren & Rudy. Davis was elected to the [[Florida House of Representatives]] in 1989 and served until 1996, serving as [[Majority leader|House Majority Leader]] from 1995 to 1996.\n\n==US House==\nDavis entered the race for the Tampa-based 11th District in 1996, after [[Sam Gibbons]]\u2014the district's only congressman since its creation in 1963\u2014announced his retirement.  Although Gibbons had endorsed Davis as his successor, Davis finished second in a four-way Democratic primary behind former Tampa mayor [[Sandra W. Freedman|Sandy Freedman]].  He won the runoff with 56 percent of the vote.\n \nHe faced Republican Mark Sharpe in the general election.  The race was initially thought to be close, especially since Sharpe had nearly defeated Gibbons in 1994 and held him to 52 percent in 1992.  However, Davis won by a convincing 15-point margin, largely due to [[Bill Clinton]] carrying the district.  After defeating an underfunded Republican in 1998, Davis faced only a Libertarian candidate in 2000 and 2004 and was completely unopposed in 2002.\n\nDavis was one of the co-chairs of the [[New Democrat Coalition]] in the House of Representatives. The New Democrat Coalition is affiliated with the centrist [[Democratic Leadership Council]].\n\nOn October 10, 2002, Jim Davis was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].\n\n==2006 Gubernatorial Campaign==\n[[File:U.S. Representative and gubernatorial candidate Jim Davis speaking at a campaign rally in Wilton Manors.jpg|thumb|right|Davis campaigning in [[Wilton Manors, Florida|Wilton Manors]]]]\nDavis announced his candidacy for governor of Florida in 2005 and won the Democratic primary held on September 5, 2006. He defeated then-state Senator [[Rod Smith (politician)|Rod Smith]] by a margin of 46 percent to 42 percent.\n\nHe received the endorsements of former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], U.S. senator for Florida [[Bill Nelson]], U.S. senator for Illinois [[Barack Obama]], former Governor and U.S. Senator [[Bob Graham]], former Governor [[Buddy MacKay]], former First Lady Rhea Chiles (wife of [[Lawton Chiles]]), former Tallahassee mayor and [[Florida Democratic Party]] chairman [[Scott Maddox]], Miami-Dade Democratic Party chairman Jimmy Morales, and Representatives [[Alcee Hastings]], [[Robert Wexler]], [[Corrine Brown]], and [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]].\n\nHe lost the race to Attorney General [[Charlie Crist]] by a margin of 52-45.\n\n==Post-political career==\n{{As of|2007}}, Davis is employed at [[Holland & Knight]] in Tampa. In 2010, Davis has been a member of and public speaker for Moving Hillsborough Forward, an organization formed to help pass a transit tax referendum on the 2010 general election ballot in [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]].\n\nIn 2010, Davis was a member of and public speaker for Moving Hillsborough Forward, an organization formed to help pass a transit tax referendum on the general election ballot in [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]].<ref>Robert Napper, \"Powerful Tampa Bay Interests Campaign for Local Light Rail Funding,\" Moving Hillsborough Forward, under \"News & Media,\" August 2, 2010, http://www.movinghillsboroughforward.org/news-media/powerful-tampa-bay-interests-campaign-for-local-light-rail-funding.aspx{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Though there was some speculation that he might potentially run for Mayor of Tampa in 2011,<ref>Mike Deeson, \"Tampa Mayor Race Gets Hotter: Bob Buckhorn is Running,\" WTSP 10 News, June 2010, http://www.wtsp.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=131766{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> he ultimately declined to run.
