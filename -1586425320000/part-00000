A year later, Japanese Prime Minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]] announced that Japan intended to sponsor the establishment of a regional development fund with resources largely from Japan and other industrial countries. But the US did not warm to the plan and the concept was shelved. See full account in  \"[https://www.adb.org/publications/50-years-adb Banking on the Future of Asia and the Pacific: 50 Years of the Asian Development Bank],\" July 2017.\n\nThe idea came up again late in 1962 when Kaoru Ohashi, an economist from a research institute in Tokyo, visited [[Takeshi Watanabe (bureaucrat)|Takeshi Watanabe]], then a private financial consultant in Tokyo, and proposed a study group to form a development bank for the Asian region. The group met regularly in 1963, examining various scenarios for setting up a new institution and drew on Watanabe's experiences with the [[World Bank]]. However, the idea received a cool reception from the World Bank itself and the study group became discouraged.\n\nIn parallel, the concept was formally proposed at a trade conference organized by the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) in 1963 by a young Thai economist, Paul Sithi-Amnuai. (ESCAP, United Nations Publication March 2007, \"The first parliament of Asia\" pp.&nbsp;65). Despite an initial mixed reaction, support for the establishment of a new bank soon grew.\n\nAn expert group was convened to study the idea, with Japan invited to contribute to the group. When Watanabe was recommended, the two streams proposing a new bank\u2014from ECAFE and Japan\u2014came together. Initially, the US was on the fence, not opposing the idea but not ready to commit financial support. But a new bank for Asia was soon seen to fit in with a broader program of assistance to Asia planned by U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the wake of the escalating US military support for the government of South Vietnam.\n\nAs a key player in the concept, Japan hoped that the ADB offices would be in Tokyo. However, eight other cities had also expressed an interest\u2014Bangkok, Colombo, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Phnom Penh, Singapore, and Tehran. To decide, the 18 prospective regional members of the new bank held three rounds of votes at a ministerial conference in Manila in November/December 1965. In the first round on 30 November, Tokyo failed to win a majority, so a second ballot was held the next day at noon. Although Japan was in the lead, it was still inconclusive, so a final vote was held after lunch. In the third poll, Tokyo gained eight votes to Manila's nine, with one abstention. Therefore, Manila was declared the host of the new development bank. The Japanese were mystified and deeply disappointed. Watanabe later wrote in his personal history of ADB: \"I felt as if the child I had so carefully reared had been taken away to a distant country.\" (Asian Development Bank publication, \"Towards a New Asia\", 1977, p.&nbsp;16)\n\nAs intensive work took place during 1966 to prepare for the opening of the new bank in Manila, high on the agenda was choice of president. Japanese Prime Minister [[Eisaku Sat\u014d]] asked Watanabe to be a candidate. Although he initially declined, pressure came from other countries and Watanabe agreed. In the absence of any other candidates, Watanabe was elected first President of the Asian Development Bank at its Inaugural Meeting on 24 November 1966.\n\nBy the end of 1972, Japan had contributed $173.7 million (22.6% of the total) to the ordinary capital resources and $122.6 million (59.6% of the total) to the special funds. In contrast, the United States contributed only $1.25 million to the special fund.<ref name=\"Ming Wan\" />\n\nAfter its creation in the 1960s, ADB focused much of its assistance on food production and rural development. At the time, Asia was one of the poorest regions in the world.<ref name=\"admin\">{{Cite web|title = ADB History|url = http://www.adb.org/about/history|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}</ref>\n\nEarly loans went largely to [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[South Korea]] and the [[Philippines]]; these nations accounted for 78.48% of the total ADB loans between 1967 and 1972. Moreover, Japan received tangible benefits, 41.67% of the total procurements between 1967 and 1976. Japan tied its special funds contributions to its preferred sectors and regions and procurements of its goods and services, as reflected in its $100 million donation for the Agricultural Special Fund in April 1968.<ref name=\"Ming Wan\" />\n\nWatanabe served as the first ADB president to 1972.<ref name=\"KapurLewis\">{{cite book|author1=Devesh Kapur|author2=John Prior Lewis|author3=Richard Charles Webb|title=The World Bank: Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=suOGRlBoPgQC&pg=PA304|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=0-8157-2014-9|pages=304\u2013|date=2010-12-01}}</ref><ref name=\"Magill2014\">{{cite book|author=Frank N.

The gradual emergence of Asian economies in the latter part of the decade spurred demand for better infrastructure to support economic growth. ADB focused on improving roads and providing electricity. When the world suffered its first oil price shock, ADB shifted more of its assistance to support energy projects, especially those promoting the development of domestic energy sources in member countries.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nFollowing considerable pressure from the Reagan Administration in the 1980s, ADB reluctantly began working with the private sector in an attempt to increase the impact of its development assistance to poor countries in Asia and the Pacific. In the wake of the second oil crisis, ADB expanded its assistance to energy projects. In 1982, ADB opened its first field office, in [[Bangladesh]], and later in the decade it expanded its work with non-government organizations (NGOs).<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nJapanese presidents Inoue Shiro (1972\u201376) and Yoshida Taroichi (1976\u201381) took the spotlight in the 1970s. Fujioka Masao, the fourth president (1981\u201390), adopted an assertive leadership style, launching an ambitious plan to expand the ADB into a high-impact development agency.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the 1990s, ADB began promoting regional cooperation by helping the countries on the Mekong River to trade and work together. The decade also saw an expansion of ADB's membership with the addition of several Central Asian countries following the end of the Cold War.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn mid-1997, ADB responded to the financial crisis that hit the region with projects designed to strengthen financial sectors and create social safety nets for the poor. During the crisis, ADB approved its largest single loan \u2013 a $4 billion emergency loan to the South Korea. In 1999, ADB adopted poverty reduction as its overarching goal.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n===2000s===\n\nThe early years of 2000s saw a dramatic expansion of private sector finance. While the institution had such operations since the 1980s (under pressure from the Reagan Administration) the early attempts were highly unsuccessful with low lending volumes, considerable losses and financial scandals associated with an entity named AFIC. However, beginning in 2002, the ADB undertook a dramatic expansion of private sector lending under a new team. Over the course of the next six years, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) grew by a factor of 41 times the 2001 levels of new financings and earnings for the ADB. This culminated with the Board's formal recognition if these achievements in March 2008, when the Board of Directors formally adopted the Long Term Strategic Framework (LTSF). That document formally stated that assistance to private sector development was the lead priority of the ADB and that it should constitute 50% of the bank's lending by 2020.\n\nIn 2003, the [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) epidemic hit the region and ADB responded with programs to help the countries in the region work together to address infectious diseases, including [[avian influenza]] and HIV/[[AIDS]]. ADB also responded to a multitude of natural disasters in the region, committing more than $850 million for recovery in areas of India, Indonesia, Maldives, and Sri Lanka which were impacted by the December 2004 Asian tsunami. In addition, $1 billion in loans and grants was provided to the victims of the October 2005 earthquake in Pakistan.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn 2009, ADB's Board of Governors agreed to triple ADB's capital base from $55 billion to $165 billion, giving it much-needed resources to respond to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|global economic crisis]]. The 200% increase is the largest in ADB's history, and was the first since 1994.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n===2010s===\nAsia moved beyond the economic crisis and by 2010 had emerged as a new engine of global economic growth though it remained home to two-thirds of the world's poor. In addition, the increasing prosperity of many people in the region created a widening [[income gap]] that left many people behind. ADB responded to this with loans and grants that encouraged economic growth.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn early 2012, the ADB began to re-engage with [[Myanmar]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = Myanmar Office|url = https://unchannel.org/index.php?organization=70&country=myanmar&city=&keyword=&page=1|publisher = unchannel.org|accessdate = 2020-04-04}}</ref> in response to reforms initiated by the government. In April 2014, ADB opened an office in Myanmar and resumed making loans and grants to the country.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn 2017, ADB combined the lending operations of its Asian Development Fund (ADF) with its ordinary capital resources (OCR).  The result was to expand the OCR balance sheet to permit increasing annual lending and grants to $20 billion by 2020 \u2014 50% more than the previous level.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n==Objectives and activities==\n\n===Aim===\nThe ADB defines itself as a [[Social change|social development]] organization that is dedicated to reducing [[poverty]] in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive [[economic growth]], environmentally [[sustainable growth]], and [[regional integration]]. This is carried out through [[investment]]s \u2013 in the form of loans, grants and information sharing \u2013 in infrastructure, health care services, financial and public administration systems, helping nations prepare for the impact of [[climate change]] or better [[natural resource management|manage their natural resources]], as well as other areas.\n\n===Focus areas===\nEighty percent of ADB's lending is concentrated public sector lending in five operational areas.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Core Operational Areas|url = http://www.adb.org/about/core-operational-areas|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* [[Education]] \u2013 Most developing countries in Asia and the Pacific have earned high marks for a dramatic rise in primary education enrollment rates in the last three decades, but daunting challenges remain, threatening economic and social growth.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Education|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/education/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Environment, Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management \u2013 [[Environmental sustainability]] is a prerequisite for economic growth and poverty reduction in Asia and the Pacific.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Environment, Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/environment/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Finance Sector Development \u2013 The financial system is the lifeline of a country's economy. It creates prosperity that can be shared throughout society and benefit the poorest and most vulnerable people. Financial sector and capital market development, including microfinance, small and medium-sized enterprises, and regulatory reforms, is vital to decreasing poverty in Asia and the Pacific.This has been a key priority of the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD)since 2002. One of the most active sub-sectors of finance is the PSOD's support for trade finance. Each year the PSOD finances billions of dollars in letters of credit across all of Asia and the rest of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Finance Sector Development|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/finance/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Infrastructure, including transport<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sustainable Transport for All|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/transport/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> and communications,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Information and Communications Technology|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/ict/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> energy,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Energy|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/energy/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> water supply and sanitation,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Water for All|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/water/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> and urban development.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Urban Development|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/urban-development/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Regional Cooperation and Integration \u2013 Regional cooperation and integration (RCI) was introduced by President Kuroda when he joined the ADB in 2004. It was seen as a long-standing priority of the Japanese government as a process by which national economies become more regionally connected. It plays a critical role in accelerating economic growth, reducing poverty and economic disparity, raising productivity and employment, and strengthening institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Regional Cooperation and Integration|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/regional-cooperation/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Private Sector Lending \u2013 This priority was introduced into the ADB's activities at the insistence of the Reagan Administration. However, that effort was never a true priority until the administration of President Tadeo Chino who in turn brought in a seasoned American banker \u2013 Robert Bestani. From then on, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) grew at a very rapid pace, growing from the smallest financing unit of the ADB to the largest in terms of financing volume. As noted earlier, this culminated in the Long Term Strategic Framework (LTSF) which was adopted by the Board in March 2008.\n\n==Financings==\nThe ADB offers \"hard\" loans on commercial terms primarily to middle income countries in Asia and \"[[Soft loan|soft\" loans]] with lower interest rates to poorer countries in the region. Based on a new policy, both types of loans will be sourced starting January 2017 from the bank's ordinary capital resources (OCR), which functions as its general operational fund.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ADF-OCR Merger to Boost Support for Region\u2019s Poor|url = http://www.adb.org/news/adf-ocr-merger-boost-support-region-s-poor|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-11-27|first = Asian Development|last = Bank}}</ref>\n\nThe ADB's Private Sector Department (PSOD) can and does offer a broader range of financings beyond commercial loans. They also have the capability to provide guarantees, equity and mezzanine finance (a combination of debt and equity).\n\nIn 2017, ADB lent $19.1 billion of which $3.2 billion went to private enterprises, as part of its \"nonsovereign\" operations. ADB's operations in 2017, including grants and cofinancing, totaled $28.9 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ADB news release|url = https://www.adb.org/news/adb-2017-operations-reach-289-billion|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2018-01-12|first = Asian Development|last = Bank}}</ref>\n\nADB obtains its funding by issuing bonds on the world's capital markets.

Critics also point out that the PSOD is the only Department that actually makes money for the ADB. Hence, with the vast majority of loans going to concessionary (sub-market) loans to the public sector, the ADB is facing considerable financial difficulty and continuous operating losses.\n\n==Largest countries and regions by subscribed capital and voting power==\nThe following table are amounts for 20 largest countries by subscribed capital and voting power at the Asian Development Bank as of December 2014.<ref name=\"adb.org1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/158032/oi-appendix1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Members, Capital Stock, and Voting Power |date=December 2014|publisher=adb.org}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|+ The 20 largest countries and regions by subscribed capital and voting power at the Asian Development Bank\n!

A year later, Japanese Prime Minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]] announced that Japan intended to sponsor the establishment of a regional development fund with resources largely from Japan and other industrial countries. But the US did not warm to the plan and the concept was shelved. See full account in  \"[https://www.adb.org/publications/50-years-adb Banking on the Future of Asia and the Pacific: 50 Years of the Asian Development Bank],\" July 2017.\n\nThe idea came up again late in 1962 when Kaoru Ohashi, an economist from a research institute in Tokyo, visited [[Takeshi Watanabe (bureaucrat)|Takeshi Watanabe]], then a private financial consultant in Tokyo, and proposed a study group to form a development bank for the Asian region. The group met regularly in 1963, examining various scenarios for setting up a new institution and drew on Watanabe's experiences with the [[World Bank]]. However, the idea received a cool reception from the World Bank itself and the study group became discouraged.\n\nIn parallel, the concept was formally proposed at a trade conference organized by the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) in 1963 by a young Thai economist, Paul Sithi-Amnuai. (ESCAP, United Nations Publication March 2007, \"The first parliament of Asia\" pp.&nbsp;65). Despite an initial mixed reaction, support for the establishment of a new bank soon grew.\n\nAn expert group was convened to study the idea, with Japan invited to contribute to the group. When Watanabe was recommended, the two streams proposing a new bank\u2014from ECAFE and Japan\u2014came together. Initially, the US was on the fence, not opposing the idea but not ready to commit financial support. But a new bank for Asia was soon seen to fit in with a broader program of assistance to Asia planned by U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the wake of the escalating US military support for the government of South Vietnam.\n\nAs a key player in the concept, Japan hoped that the ADB offices would be in Tokyo. However, eight other cities had also expressed an interest\u2014Bangkok, Colombo, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Phnom Penh, Singapore, and Tehran. To decide, the 18 prospective regional members of the new bank held three rounds of votes at a ministerial conference in Manila in November/December 1965. In the first round on 30 November, Tokyo failed to win a majority, so a second ballot was held the next day at noon. Although Japan was in the lead, it was still inconclusive, so a final vote was held after lunch. In the third poll, Tokyo gained eight votes to Manila's nine, with one abstention. Therefore, Manila was declared the host of the new development bank. The Japanese were mystified and deeply disappointed. Watanabe later wrote in his personal history of ADB: \"I felt as if the child I had so carefully reared had been taken away to a distant country.\" (Asian Development Bank publication, \"Towards a New Asia\", 1977, p.&nbsp;16)\n\nAs intensive work took place during 1966 to prepare for the opening of the new bank in Manila, high on the agenda was choice of president. Japanese Prime Minister [[Eisaku Sat\u014d]] asked Watanabe to be a candidate. Although he initially declined, pressure came from other countries and Watanabe agreed. In the absence of any other candidates, Watanabe was elected first President of the Asian Development Bank at its Inaugural Meeting on 24 November 1966.\n\nBy the end of 1972, Japan had contributed $173.7 million (22.6% of the total) to the ordinary capital resources and $122.6 million (59.6% of the total) to the special funds. In contrast, the United States contributed only $1.25 million to the special fund.<ref name=\"Ming Wan\" />\n\nAfter its creation in the 1960s, ADB focused much of its assistance on food production and rural development. At the time, Asia was one of the poorest regions in the world.<ref name=\"admin\">{{Cite web|title = ADB History|url = http://www.adb.org/about/history|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}</ref>\n\nEarly loans went largely to [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[South Korea]] and the [[Philippines]]; these nations accounted for 78.48% of the total ADB loans between 1967 and 1972. Moreover, Japan received tangible benefits, 41.67% of the total procurements between 1967 and 1976. Japan tied its special funds contributions to its preferred sectors and regions and procurements of its goods and services, as reflected in its $100 million donation for the Agricultural Special Fund in April 1968.<ref name=\"Ming Wan\" />\n\nWatanabe served as the first ADB president to 1972.<ref name=\"KapurLewis\">{{cite book|author1=Devesh Kapur|author2=John Prior Lewis|author3=Richard Charles Webb|title=The World Bank: Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=suOGRlBoPgQC&pg=PA304|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=0-8157-2014-9|pages=304\u2013|date=2010-12-01}}</ref><ref name=\"Magill2014\">{{cite book|author=Frank N.

The gradual emergence of Asian economies in the latter part of the decade spurred demand for better infrastructure to support economic growth. ADB focused on improving roads and providing electricity. When the world suffered its first oil price shock, ADB shifted more of its assistance to support energy projects, especially those promoting the development of domestic energy sources in member countries.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nFollowing considerable pressure from the Reagan Administration in the 1980s, ADB reluctantly began working with the private sector in an attempt to increase the impact of its development assistance to poor countries in Asia and the Pacific. In the wake of the second oil crisis, ADB expanded its assistance to energy projects. In 1982, ADB opened its first field office, in [[Bangladesh]], and later in the decade it expanded its work with non-government organizations (NGOs).<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nJapanese presidents Inoue Shiro (1972\u201376) and Yoshida Taroichi (1976\u201381) took the spotlight in the 1970s. Fujioka Masao, the fourth president (1981\u201390), adopted an assertive leadership style, launching an ambitious plan to expand the ADB into a high-impact development agency.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the 1990s, ADB began promoting regional cooperation by helping the countries on the Mekong River to trade and work together. The decade also saw an expansion of ADB's membership with the addition of several Central Asian countries following the end of the Cold War.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn mid-1997, ADB responded to the financial crisis that hit the region with projects designed to strengthen financial sectors and create social safety nets for the poor. During the crisis, ADB approved its largest single loan \u2013 a $4 billion emergency loan to the South Korea. In 1999, ADB adopted poverty reduction as its overarching goal.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n===2000s===\n\nThe early years of 2000s saw a dramatic expansion of private sector finance. While the institution had such operations since the 1980s (under pressure from the Reagan Administration) the early attempts were highly unsuccessful with low lending volumes, considerable losses and financial scandals associated with an entity named AFIC. However, beginning in 2002, the ADB undertook a dramatic expansion of private sector lending under a new team. Over the course of the next six years, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) grew by a factor of 41 times the 2001 levels of new financings and earnings for the ADB. This culminated with the Board's formal recognition if these achievements in March 2008, when the Board of Directors formally adopted the Long Term Strategic Framework (LTSF). That document formally stated that assistance to private sector development was the lead priority of the ADB and that it should constitute 50% of the bank's lending by 2020.\n\nIn 2003, the [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) epidemic hit the region and ADB responded with programs to help the countries in the region work together to address infectious diseases, including [[avian influenza]] and HIV/[[AIDS]]. ADB also responded to a multitude of natural disasters in the region, committing more than $850 million for recovery in areas of India, Indonesia, Maldives, and Sri Lanka which were impacted by the December 2004 Asian tsunami. In addition, $1 billion in loans and grants was provided to the victims of the October 2005 earthquake in Pakistan.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn 2009, ADB's Board of Governors agreed to triple ADB's capital base from $55 billion to $165 billion, giving it much-needed resources to respond to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|global economic crisis]]. The 200% increase is the largest in ADB's history, and was the first since 1994.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n===2010s===\nAsia moved beyond the economic crisis and by 2010 had emerged as a new engine of global economic growth though it remained home to two-thirds of the world's poor. In addition, the increasing prosperity of many people in the region created a widening [[income gap]] that left many people behind. ADB responded to this with loans and grants that encouraged economic growth.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn early 2012, the ADB began to re-engage with [[Myanmar]] in response to reforms initiated by the government. In April 2014, ADB opened an office in Myanmar and resumed making loans and grants to the country.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn 2017, ADB combined the lending operations of its Asian Development Fund (ADF) with its ordinary capital resources (OCR).  The result was to expand the OCR balance sheet to permit increasing annual lending and grants to $20 billion by 2020 \u2014 50% more than the previous level.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n==Objectives and activities==\n\n===Aim===\nThe ADB defines itself as a [[Social change|social development]] organization that is dedicated to reducing [[poverty]] in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive [[economic growth]], environmentally [[sustainable growth]], and [[regional integration]]. This is carried out through [[investment]]s \u2013 in the form of loans, grants and information sharing \u2013 in infrastructure, health care services, financial and public administration systems, helping nations prepare for the impact of [[climate change]] or better [[natural resource management|manage their natural resources]], as well as other areas.\n\n===Focus areas===\nEighty percent of ADB's lending is concentrated public sector lending in five operational areas.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Core Operational Areas|url = http://www.adb.org/about/core-operational-areas|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* [[Education]] \u2013 Most developing countries in Asia and the Pacific have earned high marks for a dramatic rise in primary education enrollment rates in the last three decades, but daunting challenges remain, threatening economic and social growth.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Education|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/education/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Environment, Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management \u2013 [[Environmental sustainability]] is a prerequisite for economic growth and poverty reduction in Asia and the Pacific.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Environment, Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/environment/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Finance Sector Development \u2013 The financial system is the lifeline of a country's economy. It creates prosperity that can be shared throughout society and benefit the poorest and most vulnerable people. Financial sector and capital market development, including microfinance, small and medium-sized enterprises, and regulatory reforms, is vital to decreasing poverty in Asia and the Pacific.This has been a key priority of the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD)since 2002. One of the most active sub-sectors of finance is the PSOD's support for trade finance. Each year the PSOD finances billions of dollars in letters of credit across all of Asia and the rest of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Finance Sector Development|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/finance/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Infrastructure, including transport<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sustainable Transport for All|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/transport/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> and communications,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Information and Communications Technology|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/ict/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> energy,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Energy|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/energy/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> water supply and sanitation,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Water for All|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/water/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> and urban development.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Urban Development|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/urban-development/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Regional Cooperation and Integration \u2013 Regional cooperation and integration (RCI) was introduced by President Kuroda when he joined the ADB in 2004. It was seen as a long-standing priority of the Japanese government as a process by which national economies become more regionally connected. It plays a critical role in accelerating economic growth, reducing poverty and economic disparity, raising productivity and employment, and strengthening institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Regional Cooperation and Integration|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/regional-cooperation/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Private Sector Lending \u2013 This priority was introduced into the ADB's activities at the insistence of the Reagan Administration. However, that effort was never a true priority until the administration of President Tadeo Chino who in turn brought in a seasoned American banker \u2013 Robert Bestani. From then on, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) grew at a very rapid pace, growing from the smallest financing unit of the ADB to the largest in terms of financing volume. As noted earlier, this culminated in the Long Term Strategic Framework (LTSF) which was adopted by the Board in March 2008.\n\n==Financings==\nThe ADB offers \"hard\" loans on commercial terms primarily to middle income countries in Asia and \"[[Soft loan|soft\" loans]] with lower interest rates to poorer countries in the region. Based on a new policy, both types of loans will be sourced starting January 2017 from the bank's ordinary capital resources (OCR), which functions as its general operational fund.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ADF-OCR Merger to Boost Support for Region\u2019s Poor|url = http://www.adb.org/news/adf-ocr-merger-boost-support-region-s-poor|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-11-27|first = Asian Development|last = Bank}}</ref>\n\nThe ADB's Private Sector Department (PSOD) can and does offer a broader range of financings beyond commercial loans. They also have the capability to provide guarantees, equity and mezzanine finance (a combination of debt and equity).\n\nIn 2017, ADB lent $19.1 billion of which $3.2 billion went to private enterprises, as part of its \"nonsovereign\" operations. ADB's operations in 2017, including grants and cofinancing, totaled $28.9 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ADB news release|url = https://www.adb.org/news/adb-2017-operations-reach-289-billion|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2018-01-12|first = Asian Development|last = Bank}}</ref>\n\nADB obtains its funding by issuing bonds on the world's capital markets.

Critics also point out that the PSOD is the only Department that actually makes money for the ADB. Hence, with the vast majority of loans going to concessionary (sub-market) loans to the public sector, the ADB is facing considerable financial difficulty and continuous operating losses.\n\n==Largest countries and regions by subscribed capital and voting power==\nThe following table are amounts for 20 largest countries by subscribed capital and voting power at the Asian Development Bank as of December 2014.<ref name=\"adb.org1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/158032/oi-appendix1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Members, Capital Stock, and Voting Power |date=December 2014|publisher=adb.org}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|+ The 20 largest countries and regions by subscribed capital and voting power at the Asian Development Bank\n!

He also reasons that one day he will want someone to love him, and that he will also make the first move then.

As the song progresses, the second Noda walks off to the side, and the video follows the first. The first Noda throws his guitar case to the ground, and becomes a black drawn tree. A bird lands on the tree, making the tree blossom and create one large apple.

He continues to walk left, and encounters a television, on which an Indian man is selling birdcages in an [[infomercial]].

It stars [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Lou Diamond Phillips]], and [[Christian Slater]], and features [[William Petersen]] as [[Pat Garrett]]. It was written and produced by John Fusco and directed by [[Geoff Murphy]].\n\nIt follows the life of [[Billy the Kid]] (played by Emilio Estevez), in the years following the [[Lincoln County War]] in which Billy was part of \"The Regulators\"&nbsp;\u2013 a group of around six highly skilled gunmen avenging the death of [[John Tunstall]]&nbsp;\u2013 and the years leading up to Billy's documented death. The film, however, is told by [[Ollie P. Roberts|Brushy Bill Roberts]], a man who in 1950 appeared claiming to be the real Billy the Kid.\n\nWhile the film takes some creative license, it does show some of the main events leading up to Billy's documented death, including his talks with Governor [[Lew Wallace]], his capture by friend-turned-foe Pat Garrett, his trial, and his subsequent escape in which he killed two deputies.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1950, attorney Charles Phalen is contacted by an elderly man named \"Brushy Bill\" Roberts. Brushy Bill tells Phalen that he is dying and wants to receive a pardon that he was promised 70 years before by the governor of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], claiming that he is really William H. Bonney aka \"Billy The Kid\", whom \"everyone\" knows to have been shot and killed by Pat Garrett in 1881. Phalen then asks if Bill has any proof that he is the famous outlaw.\n\nBrushy Bill's story begins with the remaining Regulators having gone their separate ways. Billy has become part of a new gang with \"Arkansas\" [[Dave Rudabaugh]] ([[Christian Slater|Slater]]) and Pat Garrett ([[William L. Petersen|Petersen]]). The New Mexico governor has issued warrants for the arrests of those involved in the Lincoln County Wars, including Billy, Doc Scurlock ([[Kiefer Sutherland|Sutherland]]), and Jose Chavez y Chavez ([[Lou Diamond Phillips|Phillips]]), who are dragged into town and imprisoned to await hanging.\n\nMeanwhile, Billy meets with the new governor Lew Wallace who agrees to pardon Billy if he testifies against the Dolan-Murphy faction. Billy soon finds out that he was tricked into being arrested with no chance of testifying against his old enemies. After escaping, Billy along with the help of Rudabaugh and Garrett, pose as a lynch mob to spring Doc and Chavez from jail. When the gang successfully escape Lincoln, Billy mentions the Mexican Blackbird (a broken trail only a few others and he know that leads to Mexico). Garrett decides not to go with the gang, and instead, opens a boarding house. Rudabaugh, clearly in competition with Billy, wants to lead the gang.  As they make a run for the border along with farmer Henry William French ([[Alan Ruck]]) and 14-year-old Tom O'Folliard ([[Balthazar Getty]]), cattle baron John Simpson Chisum ([[James Coburn]]) and Governor Wallace approach Garrett to offer him the job as [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]] [[sheriff]] and $1000 to use whatever resources he needs to hunt Bonney down and kill him. Garrett agrees, and forming a posse, begins his pursuit of the gang.  Chisum was approached by Billy earlier in the film, and Chisum refused to help.  So, Billy steals some of his cattle to get money they can use to get to Mexico.\n\nBilly and the gang soon come to the town of White Oaks, where they meet with former companion, Jane Greathouse ([[Jenny Wright]]), who runs a local [[Brothel|bordello]]. Later that night, the town lynch mob comes for the gang and is intent on a hanging. Deputy Carlisle tries to negotiate a deal, \"the Indian\" (Chavez) for a safe ride out. Billy refuses the offer and pushes the deputy out the door, who is then accidentally killed by the lynch mob. Garrett soon tracks Billy to the bordello, but is too late.  In response to rebuffs by Jane, Garrett uses his newfound power as Lincoln County sheriff to declare her bordello a \"house of sin\", and burns it down.  Jane decides to strip naked to humiliate the townsfolk and leave town. Meanwhile, Billy and his gang are continuously tracked by Garrett's posse, narrowly evading capture, but Tom (being mistaken for Billy) is soon shot dead by Garrett. As they hide out, Billy admits that the Mexican Blackbird does not exist; it was just a pawn to get the gang back together and to keep riding. Doc is angered and tries to leave for home, but he is shot by one of Garrett's men and sacrifices himself to enable his friends to escape an ambush.\n\nBilly the Kid is soon brought back into Lincoln by Garrett and is sentenced to death by hanging. He is then visited by Jane Greathouse, who arranges to leave a pistol in an outhouse. Billy uses the pistol to kill two guards and escapes to Old [[Fort Sumner]]. By the time he arrives, Dave has abandoned the group to make his way to Mexico, and Chavez is dying from a bullet wound he sustained during the ambush that killed Doc. During the night, Garrett finds Billy unarmed. Billy asks Garrett to let him run to Mexico and tell the authorities that he killed him. Garrett declines because he believes Billy would not be able to resist coming back to the United States (which would lead to Garrett's death for lying). Billy turns around, forcing Garrett to have to shoot him in the back, which he does not. In the morning, a fake burial is staged for Billy, and Garrett's horse is seen being taken by an unknown figure (implied to be Billy). Brushy Bill admits he never stole a horse from someone he did not like, and further admits he did not just like Garrett, he loved him. Phalen, convinced that Brushy Bill is Billy the Kid, agrees to help him.\n\nThe epilogue reveals that Arkansas Dave was beheaded once he reached Mexico to discourage more outlaws from crossing the border; Garrett's book detailing his pursuit of Billy was a dismal failure and he is eventually shot and killed in 1908; Brushy Bill met with the governor of New Mexico, but despite corroboration from several surviving friends of the Kid, he was discredited and died less than a month later; whether or not Brushy Bill was Billy the Kid remains a mystery. The final shot shows Billy pointing his gun at an off-screen target, saying to the target \"I'll make you famous\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{columnslist|\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as [[Billy the Kid|William H. \"Billy the Kid\" Bonney]] / [[Ollie P.

Fusco also appears as the \"Branded Man\" in the prison pit escape scene alongside [[Jon Bon Jovi]]. The cattle brand on Fusco's face reads J.C. for cattle rancher John Chisum.\n\nThe film's original screenplay accurately portrays Scurlock as heading to Texas with his bride. It has been reported that [[Kiefer Sutherland]], faced with scheduling conflicts, refused to return to the Young Guns franchise unless his character died in the movie's \"Stinking Springs Shoot Out\". Writer [[John Fusco]] fought against this demand, but ultimately rewrote the scene to accommodate Sutherland's schedule.\n\nJohn Chisum, played by [[James Coburn]], in the film convinces Pat Garrett to accept a job as the new Lincoln County Sheriff. Coburn himself played Garrett in [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'' (1973).\n\n==Soundtrack==\n\n===''Blaze of Glory''===\nEmilio Estevez originally approached [[Jon Bon Jovi]] to ask him for permission to include the song \"[[Wanted Dead or Alive (Bon Jovi song)|Wanted Dead Or Alive]]\" on the soundtrack.<ref name=\"bon\">July 16, 1990 [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20118248,00.html Jon Bon Jovi's Solo Debut with his band members  Leads Him to the Brink of An Abyss] People.com</ref> Bon Jovi didn't feel the song's lyrics were appropriate; however, he was inspired by the project and resolved to write a new song for the film that would be more in keeping with the period and setting.

It stars [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Lou Diamond Phillips]], and [[Christian Slater]], and features [[William Petersen]] as [[Pat Garrett]]. It was written and produced by John Fusco and directed by [[Geoff Murphy]].\n\nIt follows the life of [[Billy the Kid]] (played by Emilio Estevez), in the years following the [[Lincoln County War]] in which Billy was part of \"The Regulators\"&nbsp;\u2013 a group of around six highly skilled gunmen avenging the death of [[John Tunstall]]&nbsp;\u2013 and the years leading up to Billy's documented death. The film, however, is told by [[Ollie P. Roberts|Brushy Bill Roberts]], a man who in 1950 appeared claiming to be the real Billy the Kid.\n\nWhile the film takes some creative license, it does show some of the main events leading up to Billy's documented death, including his talks with Governor [[Lew Wallace]], his capture by friend-turned-foe Pat Garrett, his trial, and his subsequent escape in which he killed two deputies.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1950, attorney Charles Phalen is contacted by an elderly man named \"Brushy Bill\" Roberts. Brushy Bill tells Phalen that he is dying and wants to receive a pardon that he was promised 70 years before by the governor of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], claiming that he is really William H. Bonney aka \"Billy The Kid\", whom \"everyone\" knows to have been shot and killed by Pat Garrett in 1881. Phalen then asks if Bill has any proof that he is the famous outlaw.\n\nBrushy Bill's story begins with the remaining Regulators having gone their separate ways. Billy has become part of a new gang with \"Arkansas\" [[Dave Rudabaugh]] ([[Christian Slater|Slater]]) and Pat Garrett ([[William L. Petersen|Petersen]]). The New Mexico governor has issued warrants for the arrests of those involved in the Lincoln County Wars, including Billy, Doc Scurlock ([[Kiefer Sutherland|Sutherland]]), and Jose Chavez y Chavez ([[Lou Diamond Phillips|Phillips]]), who are dragged into town and imprisoned to await hanging.\n\nMeanwhile, Billy meets with the new governor Lew Wallace who agrees to pardon Billy if he testifies against the Dolan-Murphy faction. Billy soon finds out that he was tricked into being arrested with no chance of testifying against his old enemies. After escaping, Billy along with the help of Rudabaugh and Garrett, pose as a lynch mob to spring Doc and Chavez from jail. When the gang successfully escape Lincoln, Billy mentions the Mexican Blackbird (a broken trail only a few others and he know that leads to Mexico). Garrett decides not to go with the gang, and instead, opens a boarding house. Rudabaugh, clearly in competition with Billy, wants to lead the gang.  As they make a run for the border along with farmer Henry William French ([[Alan Ruck]]) and 14-year-old Tom O'Folliard ([[Balthazar Getty]]), cattle baron John Simpson Chisum ([[James Coburn]]) and Governor Wallace approach Garrett to offer him the job as [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]] [[sheriff]] and $1000 to use whatever resources he needs to hunt Bonney down and kill him. Garrett agrees, and forming a posse, begins his pursuit of the gang.  Chisum was approached by Billy earlier in the film, and Chisum refused to help.  So, Billy steals some of his cattle to get money they can use to get to Mexico.\n\nBilly and the gang soon come to the town of White Oaks, where they meet with former companion, Jane Greathouse ([[Jenny Wright]]), who runs a local [[Brothel|bordello]]. Later that night, the town lynch mob comes for the gang and is intent on a hanging. Deputy Carlisle tries to negotiate a deal, \"the Indian\" (Chavez) for a safe ride out. Billy refuses the offer and pushes the deputy out the door, who is then accidentally killed by the lynch mob. Garrett soon tracks Billy to the bordello, but is too late.  In response to rebuffs by Jane, Garrett uses his newfound power as Lincoln County sheriff to declare her bordello a \"house of sin\", and burns it down.  Jane decides to strip naked to humiliate the townsfolk and leave town. Meanwhile, Billy and his gang are continuously tracked by Garrett's posse, narrowly evading capture, but Tom (being mistaken for Billy) is soon shot dead by Garrett. As they hide out, Billy admits that the Mexican Blackbird does not exist; it was just a pawn to get the gang back together and to keep riding. Doc is angered and tries to leave for home, but he is shot by one of Garrett's men and sacrifices himself to enable his friends to escape an ambush.\n\nBilly the Kid is soon brought back into Lincoln by Garrett and is sentenced to death by hanging. He is then visited by Jane Greathouse, who arranges to leave a pistol in an outhouse. Billy uses the pistol to kill two guards and escapes to Old [[Fort Sumner]]. By the time he arrives, Dave has abandoned the group to make his way to Mexico, and Chavez is dying from a bullet wound he sustained during the ambush that killed Doc. During the night, Garrett finds Billy unarmed. Billy asks Garrett to let him run to Mexico and tell the authorities that he killed him. Garrett declines because he believes Billy would not be able to resist coming back to the United States (which would lead to Garrett's death for lying). Billy turns around, forcing Garrett to have to shoot him in the back, which he does not. In the morning, a fake burial is staged for Billy, and Garrett's horse is seen being taken by an unknown figure (implied to be Billy). Brushy Bill admits he never stole a horse from someone he did not like, and further admits he did not just like Garrett, he loved him. Phalen, convinced that Brushy Bill is Billy the Kid, agrees to help him.\n\nThe epilogue reveals that Arkansas Dave was beheaded once he reached Mexico to discourage more outlaws from crossing the border; Garrett's book detailing his pursuit of Billy was a dismal failure and he is eventually shot and killed in 1908; Brushy Bill met with the governor of New Mexico, but despite corroboration from several surviving friends of the Kid, he was discredited and died less than a month later; whether or not Brushy Bill was Billy the Kid remains a mystery. The final shot shows Billy pointing his gun at an off-screen target, saying to the target \"I'll make you famous\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{columnslist|\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as [[Billy the Kid|William H. \"Billy the Kid\" Bonney]] / [[Ollie P.

Fusco also appears as the \"Branded Man\" in the prison pit escape scene alongside [[Jon Bon Jovi]]. The cattle brand on Fusco's face reads J.C. for cattle rancher John Chisum.\n\nThe film's original screenplay accurately portrays Scurlock as heading to Texas with his bride. It has been reported that [[Kiefer Sutherland]], faced with scheduling conflicts, refused to return to the Young Guns franchise unless his character died in the movie's \"Stinking Springs Shoot Out\". Writer [[John Fusco]] fought against this demand, but ultimately rewrote the scene to accommodate Sutherland's schedule.\n\nJohn Chisum, played by [[James Coburn]], in the film convinces Pat Garrett to accept a job as the new Lincoln County Sheriff. Coburn himself played Garrett in [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'' (1973).\n\n==Soundtrack==\n\n===''Blaze of Glory''===\nEmilio Estevez originally approached [[Jon Bon Jovi]] to ask him for permission to include the song \"[[Wanted Dead or Alive (Bon Jovi song)|Wanted Dead Or Alive]]\" on the soundtrack.<ref name=\"bon\">July 16, 1990 [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20118248,00.html Jon Bon Jovi's Solo Debut with his band members  Leads Him to the Brink of An Abyss] People.com</ref> Bon Jovi didn't feel the songs lyrics were appropriate; however, he was inspired by the project and resolved to write a new song for the film that would be more in keeping with the period and setting.
