He was promoted by the Christian Church as a martyr and images of him and scenes from his life became widespread in just a few years. In a pattern often repeated, what started as an explosion of popularity (often referred to with the suffix 'mania') turned into long-lasting fame: pilgrimages to Canterbury Cathedral where he was killed became instantly fashionable and the fascination with his life and death have inspired plays and films.\n\nThe cult of personality (particularly in the west) can be traced back to the Romantics in the 18th century,<ref>{{cite book|title = A Short History of Celebrity|last = Inglis |first = Fred|publisher = Princeton University Press|date  = 2010 | isbn = 9780691135625}}</ref> whose livelihood as artists and poets depended on the currency of their reputation. The establishment of cultural hot-spots became an important factor in the process of generating fame: for example, London and Paris in the 18th and 19th centuries. Newspapers started including gossip columns <ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/concisehistbritnews/britnews19th/ | title = Concise History of the British Newspaper in the Nineteenth Century | publisher = British Library}}</ref> and certain clubs and events became places to be seen in order to receive publicity.\n\nThe [[Film industry|movie industry]] spread around the globe in the first half of the 20th century and now, the familiar concept of the instantly recognizable faces of its superstars. Yet, celebrity was not always tied to actors in films, especially when cinema was starting as a medium. As Paul McDonald states in ''The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities'', \"in the first decade of the twentieth century, American film production companies withheld the names of film performers, despite requests from audiences, fearing that public recognition would drive performers to demand higher salaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities|last = McDonald|first = Paul|publisher = Wallflower|year = 2000|isbn = 978-1-903364-02-4|location = Great Britain|pages = 15}}</ref>  Public fascination went well beyond the on-screen exploits of [[movie star]]s and their private lives became headline news: for example, in Hollywood the marriages of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and in [[Bollywood]] the affairs of [[Raj Kapoor]] in the 1950s.\n\nThe second half of the century saw [[television]] and popular music bring new forms of celebrity, such as the rock star and the pop group, epitomised by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[the Beatles]], respectively. [[John Lennon]]'s highly controversial 1966 quote: \"We're more popular than [[Jesus]] now,\"<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.beatlesbible.com/1966/03/04/how-does-a-beatle-live-by-maureen-cleave/ |newspaper = London Evening Standard|date  = 1966|author = Cleave, Maureen|title=How does a Beatle live}}</ref> which he later insisted was not a boast, and that he was not in any way comparing himself with Christ,{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=295}} gives an insight into both the adulation and notoriety that fame can bring. Unlike movies, television created celebrities who were not primarily actors; for example, presenters, talk show hosts, and newsreaders. However, most of these are only famous within the regions reached by their particular broadcaster, and only a few such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Jerry Springer]], or [[David Frost]] could be said to have broken through into wider stardom.\n\nIn the '60s and early '70s, the book publishing industry began to persuade major celebrities to put their names on autobiographies and other titles in a genre called celebrity publishing. In most cases, the book was not written by the celebrity but by a ghost-writer, but the celebrity would then be available for a book tour and appearances on talk shows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Another Life: A Memoir of Other People|last=Korda|first=Michael|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=|isbn=9780679456599|location=|pages=|quote=|via=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord}}</ref>\n\n==Becoming a celebrity==\n[[File:The Chief Guest and renowned actor Shahrukh Khan addressing at the inauguration of the 38th International Film Festival of India (IFFI-2007) at Panaji, Goa on November 23, 2007.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Shah Rukh Khan]] is an Indian actor, producer, businessman, investor, author, philanthropist, activist, host and much more. ]]\nPeople may become celebrities in a wide range of ways; from their professions, following appearances in the media, or by complete accident. The term \"instant celebrity\" describes someone who becomes a celebrity in a very short time. Someone who achieves a small amount of [[15 minutes of fame|transient fame]] (through, say, [[Media circus|hype]] or mass media) may become labeled a \"B-grade celebrity\". Often, the generalization extends to someone who falls short of mainstream or persistent fame but who seeks to extend or exploit it.\n\n===Success===\nThere are, of course, no guarantees of success for an individual to become a celebrity. Though celebrities come from many different working fields, most celebrities are typically associated with the fields of sports and entertainment, or a person may be a public figure who is commonly recognizable in mass media with commercial and critical acclaim.\n\nThough glamour and wealth may certainly play a role for only famous celebrities, most people in the sports and entertainments spheres, be it music, film, television, radio, modelling, comedy, literature etc. live in obscurity and only a small percentage achieve fame and fortune.<ref>{{cite web |author=Book of Odds (View Profile) |url=http://www.divinecaroline.com/50616/110803-odds-becoming-youtube-celebrity |title=Odds of Becoming a YouTube Celebrity |publisher=DivineCaroline |accessdate=2011-12-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102034806/http://www.divinecaroline.com/50616/110803-odds-becoming-youtube-celebrity |archivedate=January 2, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Boxall |first=Natalie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/may/26/graduates.careers |title=Making it in the music industry &#124; Money |work=The Guardian |date= May 30, 2007|accessdate=2011-12-27 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=White |first=Alison |url=http://careers.guardian.co.uk/careers-blog/music-industry-careers?commentpage=all |title=Live Q&A: Career options in the music industry &#124; Guardian careers &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Careers.guardian.co.uk |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-12-27 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cumberlandminorhockey.ca/to_the_nhl/chances.htm |title=Chances of Making it to the NHL |publisher=Cumberlandminorhockey.ca |date=2002-04-01 |accessdate=2011-12-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219081012/http://www.cumberlandminorhockey.ca/to_the_nhl/chances.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOutside of the sports and entertainment sphere, the top inventors, professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists, etc. are unlikely to become celebrities even if they are enormously successful in their field due to society's disinterest in science, [[invention]], [[medicine]], and courtroom law which is not fictional.

Although it has become commonplace for celebrities to place their name with endorsements onto products just for quick money, some celebrities have gone beyond merely using their names and have put their entrepreneurial spirit to work by becoming entrepreneurs by attaching themselves in the business aspects of entertainment and building their own business brand beyond their traditional salaried activities. Along with investing their salaried wages into growing business endeavors, several celebrities have become innovative business leaders in their respective industries, gaining the admiration of their peers and contributing to the country's economy.\n\nNumerous celebrities have ventured into becoming [[business mogul]]s and established themselves as entrepreneurs, idolizing many well known American business leaders such as [[Bill Gates]] and [[Warren Buffett]]. For instance, basketball legend [[Michael Jordan]] became an active entrepreneur involved with many sports-related ventures including investing a minority stake in the [[Charlotte Bobcats]], [[Paul Newman]] started his own [[salad dressing]] business after leaving behind a distinguished acting career, and rap musician [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] started his own [[record label]], clothing line, and an [[oil well|oil business]] while maintaining a career as a rap artist.

Most businesses and investments are well known to have a 90 to 95 percent failure rate within the first five years of operation. Not all celebrities eventually succeed with their businesses and other related side ventures. Some celebrities either went [[wikt:broke|broke]] or filed for bankruptcy as a result of dabbling with such side businesses or endorsements. Though some might question such validity since celebrities themselves are already well known, have mass appeal, and are well exposed to the general public. The average entrepreneur who is not well known and reputable to the general public does not the same marketing flexibility and status-quo as most celebrities allow and have. Therefore, compared to the average person who starts a business, celebrities already have all the cards and odds stacked in their favor.

Due to the high visibility of celebrities' private lives, their successes and shortcomings are often made very public. Celebrities are alternately portrayed as glowing examples of perfection, when they garner awards, or as decadent or immoral if they become associated with a scandal. When seen in a positive light, celebrities are frequently portrayed as possessing skills and abilities beyond average people; for example, celebrity actors are routinely celebrated for acquiring new skills necessary for filming a role within a very brief time, and to a level that amazes the professionals who train them. Similarly, some celebrities with very little formal education can sometimes be portrayed as experts on complicated issues. Some celebrities have been very vocal about their political views.

Not everything is as concealed as it was back in old Hollywood because now everything is put out on the internet by fans or even the celebrity themselves. Websites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube allow people to become a celebrity overnight. For example, [[Justin Bieber]] got his start on YouTube by posting videos of him singing and got discovered. All of his fans got direct contact with his content and were able to interact with him on several social media platforms. Social media has substantially changed what it means to be a celebrity. Instagram and YouTube allow regular people to become rich and famous all from inside their home. It also allows fans to connect with their favorite celebrity without ever meeting them in person.

For example, the [[Kennedy family]] is associated with US politics; The [[House of Windsor]] with royalty; The [[Hilton family|Hilton]] and [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] families with business; the [[Jackson family]] with popular music; and the [[The Osbournes|Osbourne]], [[Chaplin family|Chaplin]], [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|Kardashian]], [[Baldwin family|Baldwin]], and [[Barrymore family|Barrymore]] families with television and film.\n\n==Restricted access==\nAccess to celebrities is strictly controlled by their entourage of staff which includes [[Talent manager|manager]]s, [[publicist]]s, [[Talent agent|agent]]s, [[personal assistant]]s, and [[bodyguard]]s. Even journalists find it difficult to access celebrities for interviews.  Writer and actor [[Michael Musto]] said, \"You have to go through many hoops just to talk to a major celebrity. You have to get past three different sets of publicists: the publicist for the event, the publicist for the movie, and then the celebrity's personal publicist. They all have to approve you.\"<ref>[[n:An interview with gossip columnist Michael Musto on the art of celebrity journalism|en.wikinews.org]]</ref>\n\nCelebrities often hire one or more bodyguards (or close protection officer) to protect themselves and their families from threats ranging from the mundane (intrusive [[paparazzi|paparazzi photographers]] or [[autograph]]-seeking [[Fan (person)|fans]]) to serious ([[assault]], [[kidnapping]], [[assassination]], or [[stalking]]).

He was promoted by the Christian Church as a martyr and images of him and scenes from his life became widespread in just a few years. In a pattern often repeated, what started as an explosion of popularity (often referred to with the suffix 'mania') turned into long-lasting fame: pilgrimages to Canterbury Cathedral where he was killed became instantly fashionable and the fascination with his life and death have inspired plays and films.\n\nThe cult of personality (particularly in the west) can be traced back to the Romantics in the 18th century,<ref>{{cite book|title = A Short History of Celebrity|last = Inglis |first = Fred|publisher = Princeton University Press|date  = 2010 | isbn = 9780691135625}}</ref> whose livelihood as artists and poets depended on the currency of their reputation. The establishment of cultural hot-spots became an important factor in the process of generating fame: for example, London and Paris in the 18th and 19th centuries. Newspapers started including gossip columns <ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/concisehistbritnews/britnews19th/ | title = Concise History of the British Newspaper in the Nineteenth Century | publisher = British Library}}</ref> and certain clubs and events became places to be seen in order to receive publicity.\n\nThe [[Film industry|movie industry]] spread around the globe in the first half of the 20th century and now, the familiar concept of the instantly recognizable faces of its superstars. Yet, celebrity was not always tied to actors in films, especially when cinema was starting as a medium. As Paul McDonald states in ''The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities'', \"in the first decade of the twentieth century, American film production companies withheld the names of film performers, despite requests from audiences, fearing that public recognition would drive performers to demand higher salaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities|last = McDonald|first = Paul|publisher = Wallflower|year = 2000|isbn = 978-1-903364-02-4|location = Great Britain|pages = 15}}</ref>  Public fascination went well beyond the on-screen exploits of [[movie star]]s and their private lives became headline news: for example, in Hollywood the marriages of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and in [[Bollywood]] the affairs of [[Raj Kapoor]] in the 1950s.\n\nThe second half of the century saw [[television]] and popular music bring new forms of celebrity, such as the rock star and the pop group, epitomised by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[the Beatles]], respectively. [[John Lennon]]'s highly controversial 1966 quote: \"We're more popular than [[Jesus]] now,\"<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.beatlesbible.com/1966/03/04/how-does-a-beatle-live-by-maureen-cleave/ |newspaper = London Evening Standard|date  = 1966|author = Cleave, Maureen|title=How does a Beatle live}}</ref> which he later insisted was not a boast, and that he was not in any way comparing himself with Christ,{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=295}} gives an insight into both the adulation and notoriety that fame can bring. Unlike movies, television created celebrities who were not primarily actors; for example, presenters, talk show hosts, and newsreaders. However, most of these are only famous within the regions reached by their particular broadcaster, and only a few such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Jerry Springer]], or [[David Frost]] could be said to have broken through into wider stardom.\n\nIn the '60s and early '70s, the book publishing industry began to persuade major celebrities to put their names on autobiographies and other titles in a genre called celebrity publishing. In most cases, the book was not written by the celebrity but by a ghost-writer, but the celebrity would then be available for a book tour and appearances on talk shows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Another Life: A Memoir of Other People|last=Korda|first=Michael|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=|isbn=9780679456599|location=|pages=|quote=|via=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord}}</ref>\n\n==Becoming a celebrity==\n[[File:The Chief Guest and renowned actor Shahrukh Khan addressing at the inauguration of the 38th International Film Festival of India (IFFI-2007) at Panaji, Goa on November 23, 2007.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Shah Rukh Khan]] is an Indian actor, producer, businessman, investor, author, philanthropist, activist, host and much more. ]]\nPeople may become celebrities in a wide range of ways; from their professions, following appearances in the media, or by complete accident.

Someone who achieves a small amount of [[15 minutes of fame|transient fame]] (through, say, [[Media circus|hype]] or mass media) may become labeled a \"B-grade celebrity\". Often, the generalization extends to someone who falls short of mainstream or persistent fame but who seeks to extend or exploit it.\n\n===Success===\nThere are, of course, no guarantees of success for an individual to become a celebrity. Though celebrities come from many different working fields, most celebrities are typically associated with the fields of sports and entertainment, or a person may be a public figure who is commonly recognizable in mass media with commercial and critical acclaim.\n\nThough glamour and wealth may certainly play a role for only famous celebrities, most people in the sports and entertainments spheres, be it music, film, television, radio, modelling, comedy, literature etc. live in obscurity and only a small percentage achieve fame and fortune.<ref>{{cite web |author=Book of Odds (View Profile) |url=http://www.divinecaroline.com/50616/110803-odds-becoming-youtube-celebrity |title=Odds of Becoming a YouTube Celebrity |publisher=DivineCaroline |accessdate=2011-12-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102034806/http://www.divinecaroline.com/50616/110803-odds-becoming-youtube-celebrity |archivedate=January 2, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Boxall |first=Natalie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/may/26/graduates.careers |title=Making it in the music industry &#124; Money |work=The Guardian |date= May 30, 2007|accessdate=2011-12-27 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=White |first=Alison |url=http://careers.guardian.co.uk/careers-blog/music-industry-careers?commentpage=all |title=Live Q&A: Career options in the music industry &#124; Guardian careers &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Careers.guardian.co.uk |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-12-27 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cumberlandminorhockey.ca/to_the_nhl/chances.htm |title=Chances of Making it to the NHL |publisher=Cumberlandminorhockey.ca |date=2002-04-01 |accessdate=2011-12-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219081012/http://www.cumberlandminorhockey.ca/to_the_nhl/chances.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOutside of the sports and entertainment sphere, the top inventors, professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists, etc. are unlikely to become celebrities even if they are enormously successful in their field due to society's disinterest in science, [[invention]], [[medicine]], and courtroom law which is not fictional.

Although it has become commonplace for celebrities to place their name with endorsements onto products just for quick money, some celebrities have gone beyond merely using their names and have put their entrepreneurial spirit to work by becoming entrepreneurs by attaching themselves in the business aspects of entertainment and building their own business brand beyond their traditional salaried activities. Along with investing their salaried wages into growing business endeavors, several celebrities have become innovative business leaders in their respective industries, gaining the admiration of their peers and contributing to the country's economy.\n\nNumerous celebrities have ventured into becoming [[business mogul]]s and established themselves as entrepreneurs, idolizing many well known American business leaders such as [[Bill Gates]] and [[Warren Buffett]]. For instance, basketball legend [[Michael Jordan]] became an active entrepreneur involved with many sports-related ventures including investing a minority stake in the [[Charlotte Bobcats]], [[Paul Newman]] started his own [[salad dressing]] business after leaving behind a distinguished acting career, and rap musician [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] started his own [[record label]], clothing line, and an [[oil well|oil business]] while maintaining a career as a rap artist.

Most businesses and investments are well known to have a 90 to 95 percent failure rate within the first five years of operation. Not all celebrities eventually succeed with their businesses and other related side ventures. Some celebrities either went [[wikt:broke|broke]] or filed for bankruptcy as a result of dabbling with such side businesses or endorsements. Though some might question such validity since celebrities themselves are already well known, have mass appeal, and are well exposed to the general public. The average entrepreneur who is not well known and reputable to the general public does not the same marketing flexibility and status-quo as most celebrities allow and have. Therefore, compared to the average person who starts a business, celebrities already have all the cards and odds stacked in their favor.

Due to the high visibility of celebrities' private lives, their successes and shortcomings are often made very public. Celebrities are alternately portrayed as glowing examples of perfection, when they garner awards, or as decadent or immoral if they become associated with a scandal. When seen in a positive light, celebrities are frequently portrayed as possessing skills and abilities beyond average people; for example, celebrity actors are routinely celebrated for acquiring new skills necessary for filming a role within a very brief time, and to a level that amazes the professionals who train them. Similarly, some celebrities with very little formal education can sometimes be portrayed as experts on complicated issues. Some celebrities have been very vocal about their political views.

Not everything is as concealed as it was back in old Hollywood because now everything is put out on the internet by fans or even the celebrity themselves. Websites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube allow people to become a celebrity overnight. For example, [[Justin Bieber]] got his start on YouTube by posting videos of him singing and got discovered. All of his fans got direct contact with his content and were able to interact with him on several social media platforms. Social media has substantially changed what it means to be a celebrity. Instagram and YouTube allow regular people to become rich and famous all from inside their home. It also allows fans to connect with their favorite celebrity without ever meeting them in person.

For example, the [[Kennedy family]] is associated with US politics; The [[House of Windsor]] with royalty; The [[Hilton family|Hilton]] and [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] families with business; the [[Jackson family]] with popular music; and the [[The Osbournes|Osbourne]], [[Chaplin family|Chaplin]], [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|Kardashian]], [[Baldwin family|Baldwin]], and [[Barrymore family|Barrymore]] families with television and film.\n\n==Restricted access==\nAccess to celebrities is strictly controlled by their entourage of staff which includes [[Talent manager|manager]]s, [[publicist]]s, [[Talent agent|agent]]s, [[personal assistant]]s, and [[bodyguard]]s. Even journalists find it difficult to access celebrities for interviews.  Writer and actor [[Michael Musto]] said, \"You have to go through many hoops just to talk to a major celebrity. You have to get past three different sets of publicists: the publicist for the event, the publicist for the movie, and then the celebrity's personal publicist. They all have to approve you.\"<ref>[[n:An interview with gossip columnist Michael Musto on the art of celebrity journalism|en.wikinews.org]]</ref>\n\nCelebrities often hire one or more bodyguards (or close protection officer) to protect themselves and their families from threats ranging from the mundane (intrusive [[paparazzi|paparazzi photographers]] or [[autograph]]-seeking [[Fan (person)|fans]]) to serious ([[assault]], [[kidnapping]], [[assassination]], or [[stalking]]). The bodyguard travels with the celebrity during professional activities (movie shoots or concerts) and personal activities such as recreation and errands.\n\nCelebrities also typically have security staff at their home, to protect them from similar threats.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iacpo.org/ |title=International Association of Close Protection Officers |access-date=September 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115032219/http://www.iacpo.org/ |archive-date=January 15, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name = \"Celebrity-stalking has common threads \">{{cite news |title= Celebrity-stalking has common threads|url= http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/entertainment&id=6730960= |publisher= ABC|date= March 26, 2009|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==15 minutes of fame==\n{{see also|15 minutes of fame|One-hit wonder}}\n\n[[Andy Warhol]] famously coined the phrase \"[[15 minutes of fame]]\" in reference to short-lived publicity.
