Unfortunately, her in-laws demand a hefty sum of dowry. Qudsiya's family were not able to pay the dowry. Her father eventually has a heart attack after getting insulted. Aaliyan who comes actually to his employee's marriage ends up marrying Qudsiya.\nQudsiya marries Aaliyan who doesn't believe in the nikkah as he only sees it as a deal to protect her and is still adamant on marrying his longtime fianc\u00e9e Natasha. Aaliyan's family burst on him for marrying such a girl without even informing them. Aaliyan is close to his Dadi. Aaliyan ([[Sheheryar Munawar Siddiqui]]) tells his Dadi about the entire Drama. His Dadi says that she'll try to resolve the matter. She goes to Qudsiya's house to talk about it but as her Dad's health was becoming weaker she couldn't. He says that as long Qudsiya is happy and married, his heart beats would actually beat. Dadi takes Qudsiya back home. There Natasha is again angry on Aaliyan and leaves his room crashing with Qudsiya. She gets even more upset. Aaliyan asks Dadi why she brought Qudsiya with her again. Dadi explains him the entire matter. He asks that he'll give her a divorce but her Dadi warns him not to do so. Dadi tells him how good Qudsiya is and how this will affect her and her family though it is not even her mistake. Later after some day Qudsiya's dad decides to work again. He goes to office where Aaliyan's dad insult him and his daughter which results in him getting heart attack after which he eventually dies. Qudsiya gets depressed and breaks down in front of Aaliyan. Aaliyan supports her and consoles her. Later he returns to his house where everyone is really angry with him. He decides to go back at Qudsiya's place. He goes there and stays there. Later he tells Qudsiya that he has to leave. Qudsiya asks him to stay as it was raining.  But Aaliyan does not listen. But his car gets damaged. So he stays there. Next day Natasha comes there angrily and takes Aaliyan with her. Natasha and Aaliyan soon get married. They live in America whereas Qudsiya gets a job at Aaliyan's real mom's place. She takes care of her unaware of the fact that she is Aaliyan's real mom.\n\nMeanwhile, relations between Aaliyan and Natasha are not good. Natasha keeps thinking that Aaliyan is cheating on her. Soon they come to Pakistan. Natasha is mad on Aaliyan everyday on one or the other matter. Shamsa ([[Saba Hameed]]) (Aaliyan's real mom) starts liking Qudsiya for Shehnawas (Shamsa's brother) whose wife is dead. Shamsa then visits Aaliyan's Dadi. She gives  her address and asks her to give it to Aaliyan. Dadi gives it to Aaliyan and asks him to meet her. He then goes to her but is really angry at her as she left him while he was young. Shamsa gets emotional and just wishes to talk to him and hug him but he refuses and then leaves. Shamsa then tells Qudsia that today his son came and met her. Qudsia gets happy for her. Shamsa then tells her something where she mentions Aaliyan and a glass falls from Qudsia's hand as she is in deep shock. After few days Aaliyan again goes and visits her mom as he is really angry and wants to know why she left him. As he gets off his car he meets Shehnawas along with his daughter. His daughter greets her and says \"Nice to meet u uncle\" to which he replies \"Nice to meet you\" and then sees Qudsia and says \"Again\". They then get into the house where Aaliyan keeps shouting at his mom n she cries a lot. He then leaves. Later Shamsa's health conditions go worse as she has cancer at last stage. Aaliyan comes there. She says that she just wants to hug him but he refuses and leaves. Soon Shamsa passes away. Qudsia keeps calling Aaliyan bt he couldn't answer as he was sleeping. Later when he goes to hospital he breaks down in tears and hugs his mom. He asks his dad about his mom and then gets to know that his mom wasn't a bad woman. He shouts in tear and leaves. His dad comes to his dadi and shouts at her on various matters which causes the death of her. When Aaliyan returns to her he keeps talking to her and realizes that she has died. He again breaks down on tears. Later Shahnewas informs Qudsia about her death which results in Qudsia crying. She  tries calling Aaliyan. There Aaliyan calls on Shamsa's phone for which he was sure that Qudsia would pick and she did. He cries on the phone as does Qudsia. Qudsia then goes to Aaliyan's place. Consoles him. While she is about to go Aaliyan holds her hand and asks her not to go. He says \"ki Mai  bhi ruka tha kyunki tumhe meri zaroorat thi\" to which she replies \"Aap ruke kyunki aap ki gaadi kharab hogayi thi\".  He then admits that his car wasn't damaged. Soon his dad arrives and insults Qudsia. She goes down and Natasha arrives there and ends up by slapping. She insults her. Shehnawas comes and takes her back. Later Aaliyan comes to Qudsia and tells Shehnawas about him and Qudsia. Aaliyan says Qudsia that he needs him. She says that their marriage was a contract. Aaliyan says that he was sure that she would never tell this marriage is  a contract. She says to give her a divorce. He says that \"Pehle tum divorce nahi chahti thi aur ab mai ...mai tumhe divorce nahi dunga\". She again says to give her a divorce. He holds her hand, holds her closer, and says that she is his wife. She says being a wife does not mean that whenever he wants he can hold her hands and whenever he wants he can leave. He apologizes to her. He then says that hell be coming tomorrow and asks her to be ready. When he reaches home Natasha shouts and says that she can't live with him anymore. She goes to America. Later Aaliyan's dad goes and insults Qudsia to which she answers sincerely. The film ends with Aaliyan and Qudsia shown happy together.\n\n== Production and project details ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | Project Details\n|-\n| Release Date\n| 18 September 2013\n|-\n| Genre\n| Drama\n|-\n| Network\n| Geo Television Network\n|-\n| Starring\n| [[Sheheryar Munawar Siddiqui]], [[Sajal Ali]], [[Emmad Irfani]], [[Sanam Chaudhry]], [[Saba Hameed]], [[Mehmood Akhtar]], Saba Faisal, Tariq Jameel, Pari Hashmi, Manzoor Qureshi, Azra Aftab, Yasir Ali and others.<ref>{{cite news|title=details of the project|url=http://aasmanonpaylikha.blogspot.com/2013/11/project-details.html}}</ref>\n|-\n| Producers\n| Asif Raza Mir and [[Babar Javed]]\n|-\n| Director\n| Mohsin Mirza\n|-\n| Writer\n| Rabia Razzaque\n|-\n| Presentation\n| Geo AnB Productions\n|}\n<ref>{{cite news|title=details of the project|url=https://www.facebook.com/AasmanonPayLikha/info}}</ref>\n\n== Original sound track ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | OST : Aasmanon Pay Likha\n|-\n| Vocals\n| Adeeb\n|-\n| Lyrics\n| Sabir Zafar\n|-\n| Music Composer\n| Waqar Ali\n|}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe drama was critical acclaim in Pakistan due to its romantic scenes and great story.

It also aired on Indian channel [[Rishtey (TV channel)|Rishtey]]. Currently it airs everyday on [[Geo Kahani]].\n\n== Plot ==\nQudsiya ([[Sajal Ali]]), a normal middle class girl dreams of a simple married life. Unfortunately, her in-laws demand a hefty sum of dowry. Qudsiya's family were not able to pay the dowry. Her father eventually has a heart attack after getting insulted. Aaliyan who comes actually to his employee's marriage ends up marrying Qudsiya.\nQudsiya gets married to Aaliyan who doesn't believe in the nikkah as he only sees it as a deal to protect her and is still adamant on marrying his longtime Fianc\u00e9 Natasha. Aaliyan's family burst on him for marrying such a girl without even informing them. Aaliyan is close to his Dadi. Aaliyan ([[Sheheryar Munawar Siddiqui]]) tells his Dadi about the entire Drama. His Dadi says that she'll try to resolve the matter. She goes to Qudsiya's house to talk about it but as her Dad's health was becoming weaker she couldn't. He says that as long Qudsiya is happy and married, his heart beats would actually beat. Dadi takes Qudsiya back home. There Natasha is again angry on Aaliyan and leaves his room crashing with Qudsiya. She gets even more upset. Aaliyan asks Dadi why she brought Qudsiya with her again. Dadi explains him the entire matter. He asks that he'll give her a divorce but her Dadi warns him not to do so. Dadi tells him how good Qudsiya is and how this will affect her and her family though it is not even her mistake. Later after some day Qudsiya's dad decides to work again. He goes to office where Aaliyan's dad insult him and his daughter which results in him getting heart attack after which he eventually dies. Qudsiya gets depressed and breaks down in front of Aaliyan. Aaliyan supports her and consoles her. Later he returns to his house where everyone is really angry with him. He decides to go back at Qudsiya's place. He goes there and stays there. Later he tells Qudsiya that he has to leave. Qudsiya asks him to stay as it was raining.  But Aaliyan does not listen. But his car gets damaged. So he stays there. Next day Natasha comes there angrily and takes Aaliyan with her. Natasha and Aaliyan soon get married. They live in America whereas Qudsiya gets a job at Aaliyan's real mom's place. She takes care of her unaware of the fact that she is Aaliyan's real mom.\n\nMeanwhile, relations between Aaliyan and Natasha are not good. Natasha keeps thinking that Aaliyan is cheating on her. Soon they come to Pakistan. Natasha is mad on Aaliyan everyday on one or the other matter. Shamsa ([[Saba Hameed]]) (Aaliyan's real mom) starts liking Qudsiya for Shehnawas (Shamsa's brother) whose wife is dead. Shamsa then visits Aaliyan's Dadi. She gives  her address and asks her to give it to Aaliyan. Dadi gives it to Aaliyan and asks him to meet her. He then goes to her but is really angry at her as she left him while he was young. Shamsa gets emotional and just wishes to talk to him and hug him but he refuses and then leaves. Shamsa then tells Qudsia that today his son came and met her. Qudsia gets happy for her. Shamsa then tells her something where she mentions Aaliyan and a glass falls from Qudsia's hand as she is in deep shock. After few days Aaliyan again goes and visits her mom as he is really angry and wants to know why she left him. As he gets off his car he meets Shehnawas along with his daughter. His daughter greets her and says \"Nice to meet u uncle\" to which he replies \"Nice to meet you\" and then sees Qudsia and says \"Again\" . They then get into the house where Aaliyan keeps shouting at his mom n she cries a lot. He then leaves. Later Shamsa's health conditions go worse as she has cancer at last stage. Aaliyan comes there. She says that she just wants to hug him but he refuses and leaves. Soon Shamsa passes away. Qudsia keeps calling Aaliyan bt he couldn't answer as he was sleeping. Later when he goes to hospital he breaks down in tears and hugs his mom. He asks his dad about his mom and then gets to know that his mom wasn't a bad woman. He shouts in tear and leaves. His dad comes to his dadi and shouts at her on various matters which causes the death of her. When Aaliyan returns to her he keeps talking to her and realizes that she has died. He again breaks down on tears. Later Shahnewas informs Qudsia about her death which results in Qudsia crying. She  tries calling Aaliyan. There Aaliyan calls on Shamsa's phone for which he was sure that Qudsia would pick and she did. He cries on the phone as does Qudsia. Qudsia then goes to Aaliyan's place. Consoles him. While she is about to go Aaliyan holds her hand and asks her not to go. He says \"ki Mai  bhi ruka tha kyunki tumhe meri zaroorat thi\" to which she replies \"Aap ruke kyunki aap ki gaadi kharab hogayi thi\".  He then admits that his car wasn't damaged. Soon his dad arrives and insults Qudsia. She goes down and Natasha arrives there and ends up by slapping. She insults her. Shehnawas comes and takes her back. Later Aaliyan comes to Qudsia and tells Shehnawas about him and Qudsia. Aaliyan says Qudsia that he needs him. She says that their marriage was a contract. Aaliyan says that he was sure that she would never tell this marriage is  a contract. She says to give her a divorce. He says that \"Pehle tum divorce nahi chahti thi aur ab mai ...mai tumhe divorce nahi dunga\" . She again says to give her a divorce. He holds her hand, holds her closer, and says that she is his wife. She says being a wife does not mean that whenever he wants he can hold her hands and whenever he wants he can leave. He apologizes to her. He then says that hell be coming tomorrow and asks her to be ready. When he reaches home Natasha shouts and says that she can't live with him anymore. She goes to America. Later Aaliyan's dad goes and insults Qudsia to which she answers sincerely. Lastly it is shown that Aaliyan and Qudsia are happy together.\n\n== Production and project details ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | Project Details\n|-\n| Release Date\n| 18 September 2013\n|-\n| Genre\n| Drama\n|-\n| Network\n| Geo Television Network\n|-\n| Starring\n| [[Sheheryar Munawar Siddiqui]], [[Sajal Ali]], [[Emmad Irfani]], [[Sanam Chaudhry]], [[Saba Hameed]], [[Mehmood Akhtar]], Saba Faisal, Tariq Jameel, Pari Hashmi, Manzoor Qureshi, Azra Aftab, Yasir Ali and others.<ref>{{cite news|title=details of the project|url=http://aasmanonpaylikha.blogspot.com/2013/11/project-details.html}}</ref>\n|-\n| Producers\n| Asif Raza Mir & [[Babar Javed]]\n|-\n| Director\n| Mohsin Mirza\n|-\n| Writer\n| Rabia Razzaque\n|-\n| Presentation\n| Geo AnB Productions\n|}\n<ref>{{cite news|title=details of the project|url=https://www.facebook.com/AasmanonPayLikha/info}}</ref>\n\n== Original sound track ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | OST : Aasmanon Pay Likha\n|-\n| Vocals\n| Adeeb\n|-\n| Lyrics\n| Sabir Zafar\n|-\n| Music Composer\n| Waqar Ali\n|}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe drama was critical acclaim in Pakistan due to its romantic scenes and great story.

Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1899; Vol. I, pp. xi\u2013xii.</ref>\n\nJohn Chaucer married Agnes Copton, who inherited properties in 1349, including 24 shops in London from her uncle Hamo de Copton, who is described in a will dated 3 April 1354 and listed in the City Hustings Roll as \"moneyer\", said to be moneyer at the [[Tower of London]]. In the City Hustings Roll 110, 5, Ric II, dated June 1380, Chaucer refers to himself as ''me Galfridum Chaucer, filium Johannis Chaucer, Vinetarii, Londonie'', which translates as: \"Geoffrey Chaucer, son of John Chaucer, vintners, London\".\n\n==Career==\nWhile records concerning the lives of his contemporaries, [[William Langland]] and the [[Pearl Poet]], are practically non-existent, since Chaucer was a public servant, his official life is very well documented, with nearly five hundred written items testifying to his career. The first of the \"Chaucer Life Records\" appears in 1357, in the household accounts of [[Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster|Elizabeth de Burgh]], the [[Earl of Ulster|Countess of Ulster]], when he became the noblewoman's page through his father's connections,<ref>Skeat (1899); Vol. I, p. xvii.</ref> a common medieval form of apprenticeship for boys into knighthood or prestige appointments. The countess was married to [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel, Duke of Clarence]], the second surviving son of the king, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], and the position brought the teenage Chaucer into the close court circle, where he was to remain for the rest of his life. He also worked as a courtier, a diplomat, and a civil servant, as well as working for the king from 1389 to 1391 as Clerk of the King's Works.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Critical Companion to Chaucer: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work |last1=Rossignol |first1=Rosalyn |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |pages=551, 613 |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-8160-6193-8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1359, in the early stages of the [[Hundred Years' War]], [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] invaded France and Chaucer travelled with [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]], Elizabeth's husband, as part of the [[History of the British Army|English army]]. In 1360, he was captured during the [[Reims Campaign|siege of Rheims]]. Edward paid \u00a316 for his ransom,<ref>''Chaucer Life Records'', p. 24.</ref> a considerable sum {{Inflation|UK|value=16|start_year=1360|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}},{{Inflation/fn|UK}} and Chaucer was released.\n\n[[File:ChaucerCrest EwelmeChurch Oxfordshire.png|thumb|Chaucer crest ''A unicorn's head'' with [[canting arms]] of Roet below: ''Gules, three Catherine Wheels or'' (French ''rouet'' = \"spinning wheel\").

Around 1366, Chaucer married [[Philippa (de) Roet]]. She was a lady-in-waiting to Edward III's queen, [[Philippa of Hainault]], and a sister of [[Katherine Swynford]], who later (c. 1396) became the third wife of [[John of Gaunt]]. It is uncertain how many children Chaucer and Philippa had, but three or four are most commonly cited. His son, [[Thomas Chaucer]], had an illustrious career, as [[Chief Butler of England|chief butler]] to four kings, envoy to France, and [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. Thomas's daughter, [[Alice de la Pole|Alice]], married the [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]].

He became a member of the royal court of Edward III as a ''[[valet de chambre]]'', [[yeoman]], or [[esquire]] on 20 June 1367, a position which could entail a wide variety of tasks. His wife also received a pension for court employment. He travelled abroad many times, at least some of them in his role as a valet. In 1368, he may have attended the wedding of [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp]] to [[Violante Visconti]], daughter of [[Galeazzo II Visconti]], in [[Milan]]. Two other literary stars of the era were in attendance: [[Jean Froissart]] and [[Petrarch]]. Around this time, Chaucer is believed to have written ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' in honour of [[Blanche of Lancaster]], the late wife of John of Gaunt, who died in 1369 of the plague.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Holt Literature and Language Arts |last= |first= |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |year=2003 |isbn=978-0030573743 |location= |pages=113}}</ref>\n\nChaucer travelled to [[Picardy]] the next year as part of a military expedition; in 1373 he visited [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]]. Numerous scholars such as Skeat, Boitani, and Rowland<ref>Companion to Chaucer Studies, Rev. ed., Oxford UP, 1979</ref> suggested that, on this Italian trip, [[Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio|he came into contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio]].

Later documents suggest it was a mission, along with Jean Froissart, to arrange a marriage between the future King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and a French princess, thereby ending the [[Hundred Years War]]. If this was the purpose of their trip, they seem to have been unsuccessful, as no wedding occurred.\n\nIn 1378, Richard II sent Chaucer as an envoy (secret dispatch) to the Visconti and to Sir [[John Hawkwood]], English [[condottiere]] (mercenary leader) in [[Milan]]. It has been speculated that it was Hawkwood on whom Chaucer based his character the Knight in the ''Canterbury Tales'', for a description matches that of a 14th-century condottiere.\n\n[[File:Geoffrey Chaucer.jpeg|left|thumb|A 19th-century depiction of Chaucer]]\nA possible indication that his career as a writer was appreciated came when [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] granted Chaucer \"a gallon of wine daily for the rest of his life\" for some unspecified task. This was an unusual grant, but given on a day of celebration, [[St George's Day]], 1374, when artistic endeavours were traditionally rewarded, it is assumed to have been another early poetic work. It is not known which, if any, of Chaucer's extant works prompted the reward, but the suggestion of him as poet to a king places him as a precursor to later [[poets laureate]]. Chaucer continued to collect the liquid stipend until Richard II came to power, after which it was converted to a monetary grant on 18 April 1378.\n\nChaucer obtained the very substantial job of [[comptroller]] of the customs for the port of London, which he began on 8 June 1374.<ref>Morley, Henry (1890) ''English Writers: an attempt towards a history of English literature''. London: Cassell & Co.; Vol. V. p. 106.</ref> He must have been suited for the role as he continued in it for twelve years, a long time in such a post at that time. His life goes undocumented for much of the next ten years, but it is believed that he wrote (or began) most of his famous works during this period.

He is thought to have started work on ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the early 1380s. He also became a member of parliament for Kent in 1386, and attended the '[[Wonderful Parliament]]' that year.

The phrase \"long castel\" is a reference to Lancaster (also called \"Loncastel\" and \"Longcastell\"), \"walles white\" is thought to be an oblique reference to Blanche, \"Seynt Johan\" was John of Gaunt's name-saint, and \"ryche hil\" is a reference to Richmond. These references reveal the identity of the grieving black knight of the poem as John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Richmond. \"White\" is the English translation of the French word \"blanche\", implying that the white lady was [[Blanche of Lancaster]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Riverside Chaucer |last1=Wilcockson |first1=Colin |editor1-last=Benson |editor1-first=Larry D. |editor2-last=Pratt |editor2-first=Robert |editor3-last=Robinson |editor3-first=F.

''Fortune'', in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes that she has been kind to him, claims that he does not know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, \"And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve\" (32, 40, 48). Chaucer retorts, \"My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse\" (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends. ''Fortune'' turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and \"Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne\" (78\u201379). The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|York]], and [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Gloucester]], and a portion of line 76 (\"as three of you or tweyne\") is thought to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of at least two of the three dukes.<ref name=\"Gross, Zaila 1987 635\" /> Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's \"beste frend\". ''Fortune'' states three times in her response to the plaintiff, \"And also, you still have your best friend alive\" (32, 40, 48); she also refers to his \"beste frend\" in the envoy when appealing to his \"noblesse\" to help Chaucer to a higher estate. The narrator makes a fifth reference when he rails at ''Fortune'' that she shall not take his friend from him.\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nChaucer's attitudes toward the Church should not be confused with his attitudes toward Christianity.

His ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'', ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' all date from this time.

B. McCully and J. J. Anderson, ''English Historical Metrics'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 97.</ref> Chaucer is known for metrical innovation, inventing the [[rhyme royal]], and he was one of the first English poets to use the five-stress line, a decasyllabic cousin to the [[iambic pentameter]], in his work, with only a few anonymous short works using it before him.<ref>[[Marchette Chute]], ''Geoffrey Chaucer of England'' E. P. Dutton, 1946, p. 89.</ref> The arrangement of these five-stress lines into rhyming [[couplet]]s, first seen in his ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', was used in much of his later work and became one of the standard poetic forms in English. His early influence as a satirist is also important, with the common humorous device, the funny accent of a regional [[dialect]], apparently making its first appearance in ''[[The Reeve's Tale]]''.\n\nThe poetry of Chaucer, along with other writers of the era, is credited with helping to standardise the London Dialect of the [[Middle English]] language from a combination of the Kentish and Midlands dialects.<ref>Edwin Winfield Bowen, ''Questions at Issue in our English Speech'', NY: Broadway Publishing, 1909, p. 147.</ref> This is probably overstated; the influence of the court, [[Lord Chancellor|chancery]] and bureaucracy \u2013 of which Chaucer was a part \u2013 remains a more probable influence on the development of [[Standard English]]. [[Modern English]] is somewhat distanced from the language of Chaucer's poems owing to the effect of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] some time after his death. This change in the [[pronunciation]] of English, still not fully understood, makes the reading of Chaucer difficult for the modern audience. The status of the final ''-e'' in Chaucer's verse is uncertain: it seems likely that during the period of Chaucer's writing the final ''-e'' was dropping out of colloquial English and that its use was somewhat irregular. Chaucer's versification suggests that the final ''-e'' is sometimes to be vocalised, and sometimes to be silent; however, this remains a point on which there is disagreement. When it is vocalised, most scholars pronounce it as a [[schwa]]. Apart from the irregular spelling, much of the vocabulary is recognisable to the modern reader. Chaucer is also recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as the first author to use many common English words in his writings. These words were probably frequently used in the language at the time but Chaucer, with his ear for common speech, is the earliest extant manuscript source. ''Acceptable'', ''alkali'', ''altercation'', ''amble'', ''angrily'', ''annex'', ''annoyance'', ''approaching'', ''arbitration'', ''armless'', ''army'', ''arrogant'', ''arsenic'', ''arc'', ''artillery'' and ''aspect'' are just some of the many [[English words first attested in Chaucer]].\n\n===Literary===\nWidespread knowledge of Chaucer's works is attested by the many poets who imitated or responded to his writing. [[John Lydgate]] was one of the earliest poets to write continuations of Chaucer's unfinished ''Tales'' while [[Robert Henryson]]'s ''Testament of Cresseid'' completes the story of [[Cressida]] left unfinished in his ''Troilus and Criseyde''. Many of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works contain material from these poets and later appreciations by the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] poets were shaped by their failure to distinguish the later \"additions\" from original Chaucer. Writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as [[John Dryden]], admired Chaucer for his stories, but not for his rhythm and rhyme, as few critics could then read Middle English and the text had been butchered by printers, leaving a somewhat unadmirable mess.<ref>\"From The Preface to ''Fables Ancient and Modern''\". ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature''. Stephen Greenblatt. 8th ed. Vol. C. New York, London: Norton, 2006. 2132\u201333. p. 2132.</ref> It was not until the late 19th century that the official Chaucerian canon, accepted today, was decided upon, largely as a result of [[Walter William Skeat]]'s work. Roughly seventy-five years after Chaucer's death, ''The Canterbury Tales'' was selected by [[William Caxton]] to be one of the first books to be printed in England.\n\n===English===\nChaucer is sometimes considered the source of the English vernacular tradition. His achievement for the language can be seen as part of a general historical trend towards the creation of a [[vernacular literature]], after the example of [[Dante]], in many parts of Europe. A parallel trend in Chaucer's own lifetime was underway in Scotland through the work of his slightly earlier contemporary, [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]], and was likely to have been even more general, as is evidenced by the example of the [[Pearl Poet]] in the north of England.\n\nAlthough Chaucer's language is much closer to Modern English than the text of ''[[Beowulf]]'', such that (unlike that of ''Beowulf'') a Modern English-speaker with a large vocabulary of archaic words may understand it, it differs enough that most publications modernise his idiom. The following is a sample from the prologue of ''[[The Summoner's Tale]]'' that compares Chaucer's text to a modern translation:\n\n:{| cellspacing=\"4\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n| || ''Original Text'' || ''Modern Translation''\n|-\n| || This frere bosteth that he knoweth helle,\n| This friar boasts that he knows hell,\n|-\n| || And God it woot, that it is litel wonder;\n| And God knows that it is little wonder;\n|-\n| || Freres and feendes been but lyte asonder.\n| Friars and fiends are seldom far apart.\n|-\n| || For, pardee, ye han ofte tyme herd telle\n| For, by God, you have ofttimes heard tell\n|-\n|  || How that a frere ravyshed was to helle\n| How a friar was taken to hell\n|-\n| || In spirit ones by a visioun;\n| In spirit, once by a vision;\n|-\n| || And as an angel ladde hym up and doun,\n| And as an angel led him up and down,\n|-\n|  || To shewen hym the peynes that the were,\n| To show him the pains that were there,\n|-\n| || In al the place saugh he nat a frere;\n| In all the place he saw not a friar;\n|-\n| || Of oother folk he saugh ynowe in wo.\n| Of other folk he saw enough in woe.\n|-\n|  || Unto this angel spak the frere tho:\n| Unto this angel spoke the friar thus:\n|-\n| || Now, sire, quod he, han freres swich a grace     \n| \"Now sir\", said he, \"Have friars such a grace\n|-\n| || That noon of hem shal come to this place?\n| That none of them come to this place?\"\n|-\n| || Yis, quod this aungel, many a millioun!\n| \"Yes\", said the angel, \"many a million!\"\n|-\n| || And unto sathanas he ladde hym doun.\n| And unto Satan the angel led him down.\n|-\n| || \u2013And now hath sathanas, \u2013seith he, \u2013a tayl\n| \"And now Satan has\", he said, \"a tail,\n|-\n|  || Brodder than of a carryk is the sayl.\n| Broader than a galleon's sail.\n|-\n| || Hold up thy tayl, thou sathanas!\u2013quod he;\n| Hold up your tail, Satan!\" said he.\n|-\n| || \u2013shewe forth thyn ers, and lat the frere se\n| \"Show forth your arse, and let the friar see\n|-\n| || Where is the nest of freres in this place!\u2013\n| Where the nest of friars is in this place!\"\n|-\n| || And er that half a furlong wey of space,\n| And before half a furlong of space,\n|-\n| || Right so as bees out swarmen from an hyve,    \n| Just as bees swarm out from a hive,\n|-\n| ||Out of the develes ers ther gonne dryve\n| Out of the devil's arse there were driven\n|-\n| || Twenty thousand freres on a route,\n| Twenty thousand friars on a rout,\n|-\n| || And thurghout helle swarmed al aboute,\n| And throughout hell swarmed all about,\n|-\n| || And comen agayn as faste as they may gon,    \n| And came again as fast as they could go,\n|-\n| || And in his ers they crepten everychon.\n| And every one crept into his arse.\n|-\n|  ||He clapte his tayl agayn and lay ful stille.\n| He shut his tail again and lay very still.<ref>Original e-text available online at the [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Cha2Can.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/lv1/Archive/mideng-parsed&tag=public&part=17&division=div2 University of Virginia website], trans.

There are 83 surviving manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales (in whole or part) alone, along with sixteen of ''Troilus and Criseyde'', including the personal copy of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]].<ref>Benson, Larry, ''The Riverside Chaucer'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1987), p. 1118.</ref> Given the ravages of time, it is likely that these surviving manuscripts represent hundreds since lost. Chaucer's original audience was a courtly one, and would have included women as well as men of the upper social classes. Yet even before his death in 1400, Chaucer's audience had begun to include members of the rising literate, middle and merchant classes, which included many [[Lollard]] sympathisers who may well have been inclined to read Chaucer as one of their own, particularly in his satirical writings about friars, priests, and other church officials. In 1464, John Baron, a tenant farmer in Agmondesham ([[Amersham]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]), was brought before [[John Chadworth]], the Bishop of Lincoln, on charges of being a Lollard heretic; he confessed to owning a \"boke of the Tales of Caunterburie\" among other suspect volumes.<ref>Potter, Russell A., \"Chaucer and the Authority of Language: The Politics and Poetics of the Vernacular in Late Medieval England\", ''Assays'' VI (Carnegie-Mellon Press, 1991), p. 91.</ref>\n\n===Printed editions===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2017}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[William Caxton]], the first English printer, was responsible for the first two [[folio]] editions of ''The Canterbury Tales'' which were published in 1478 and 1483.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg076.htm |title=A Leaf from The Canterbury Tales | location=Westminster, England \n| publisher=William Caxton | year=1473 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031075730/http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg076.htm |archivedate=31 October 2005}}</ref> Caxton's second printing, by his own account, came about because a customer complained that the printed text differed from a manuscript he knew; Caxton obligingly used the man's manuscript as his source. Both Caxton editions carry the equivalent of manuscript authority. Caxton's edition was reprinted by his successor, [[Wynkyn de Worde]], but this edition has no independent authority.\n \n[[Richard Pynson]], the [[King's Printer]] under Henry VIII for about twenty years, was the first to collect and sell something that resembled an edition of the collected works of Chaucer; however, in the process, he introduced five previously printed texts that are now known not to be Chaucer's. (The collection is actually three separately printed texts, or collections of texts, bound together as one volume.) There is a likely connection between Pynson's product and [[William Thynne]]'s a mere six years later. Thynne had a successful career from the 1520s until his death in 1546, as chief clerk of the kitchen of Henry VIII, one of the masters of the royal household. He spent years comparing various versions of Chaucer's works, and selected 41 pieces for publication. While there were questions over the authorship of some of the material, there is not doubt this was the first comprehensive view of Chaucer's work. ''The Workes of Geffray Chaucer,'' published in 1532, was the first edition of Chaucer's collected works. His editions of ''Chaucer's Works'' in 1532 and 1542 were the first major contributions to the existence of a widely recognised Chaucerian [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]. Thynne represents his edition as a book sponsored by and supportive of the king who is praised in the preface by [[Sir Brian Tuke]]. Thynne's canon brought the number of apocryphal works associated with Chaucer to a total of 28, even if that was not his intention.<ref name=Stow1561 /> As with Pynson, once included in the ''Works'', [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]] texts stayed with those works, regardless of their first editor's intentions.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, Chaucer was printed more than any other English author, and he was the first author to have his works collected in comprehensive single-volume editions in which a Chaucer [[wikt:canon|canon]] began to cohere. Some scholars contend that 16th-century editions of Chaucer's ''Works'' set the precedent for all other English authors in terms of presentation, prestige and success in print. These editions certainly established Chaucer's reputation, but they also began the complicated process of reconstructing and frequently inventing Chaucer's biography and the canonical list of works which were attributed to him.\n\nProbably the most significant aspect of the growing [[apocrypha]] is that, beginning with Thynne's editions, it began to include medieval texts that made Chaucer appear as a [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestant]] [[Lollard]], primarily the ''[[Testament of Love]]'' and ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]''. As \"Chaucerian\" works that were not considered apocryphal until the late 19th century, these medieval texts enjoyed a new life, with English Protestants carrying on the earlier Lollard project of appropriating existing texts and authors who seemed sympathetic\u2014or malleable enough to be construed as sympathetic\u2014to their cause. The official Chaucer of the early printed volumes of his ''Works'' was construed as a proto-Protestant as the same was done, concurrently, with [[William Langland]] and ''[[Piers Plowman]]''.\n\nThe famous ''Plowman's Tale'' did not enter Thynne's ''Works'' until the second, 1542, edition. Its entry was surely facilitated by Thynne's inclusion of [[Thomas Usk]]'s ''Testament of Love'' in the first edition. The ''Testament of Love'' imitates, borrows from, and thus resembles Usk's contemporary, Chaucer. (''Testament of Love'' also appears to borrow from ''Piers Plowman''.) Since the ''Testament of Love'' mentions its author's part in a failed plot (book 1, chapter 6), his imprisonment, and (perhaps) a recantation of (possibly Lollard) heresy, all this was associated with Chaucer. (Usk himself was executed as a traitor in 1388.) [[John Foxe]] took this recantation of heresy as a defence of the true faith, calling Chaucer a \"right Wiclevian\" and (erroneously) identifying him as a schoolmate and close friend of [[John Wycliffe]] at [[Merton College, Oxford]]. ([[Thomas Speght]] is careful to highlight these facts in his editions and his \"Life of Chaucer\".) No other sources for the ''Testament of Love'' exist\u2014there is only Thynne's construction of whatever manuscript sources he had.\n\n[[John Stow]] (1525\u20131605) was an antiquarian and also a chronicler. His edition of Chaucer's ''Works'' in 1561<ref name=Stow1561>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg077.htm |title=UWM.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111220719/http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg077.htm |archivedate=11 November 2005}}</ref> brought the apocrypha to more than 50 titles. More were added in the 17th century, and they remained as late as 1810, well after [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] pared the canon down in his 1775 edition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg079.htm |title=The Canterbury Tales of Chaucer: To Which are Added an Essay on his Language and Versification, and an Introductory Discourse, Together with Notes and a Glossary by the late Thomas Tyrwhitt.

What was added to Chaucer often helped represent him favourably to Protestant England.\n\n[[File:Chaucer 1602.jpg|thumb|Engraving of Chaucer from [[Thomas Speght|Speght's]] edition. The two top shields display: ''Per pale argent and gules, a bend counterchanged'' (Chaucer), that at bottom left: ''Gules, three [[Breaking wheel|Catherine Wheels]] or'' (Roet, [[canting arms]], French ''rouet'' = \"spinning wheel\"), and that at bottom right displays Roet quartering ''Argent, a chief gules overall a lion rampant double queued or'' (Chaucer) with crest of Chaucer above: ''A unicorn head'']]\n\nIn his 1598 edition of the ''Works'', Speght (probably taking cues from Foxe) made good use of Usk's account of his political intrigue and imprisonment in the ''Testament of Love'' to assemble a largely fictional \"Life of Our Learned English Poet, Geffrey Chaucer\". Speght's \"Life\" presents readers with an erstwhile radical in troubled times much like their own, a proto-Protestant who eventually came round to the king's views on religion. Speght states, \"In the second year of Richard the second, the King tooke Geffrey Chaucer and his lands into his protection. The occasion wherof no doubt was some daunger and trouble whereinto he was fallen by favouring some rash attempt of the common people.\" Under the discussion of Chaucer's friends, namely John of Gaunt, Speght further explains:\n\n::Yet it seemeth that [Chaucer] was in some trouble in the daies of King Richard the second, as it may appeare in the Testament of Loue: where hee doth greatly complaine of his owne rashnesse in following the multitude, and of their hatred against him for bewraying their purpose. And in that complaint which he maketh to his empty purse, I do find a written copy, which I had of Iohn Stow (whose library hath helped many writers) wherein ten times more is adioined, then is in print. Where he maketh great lamentation for his wrongfull imprisonment, wishing death to end his daies: which in my iudgement doth greatly accord with that in the Testament of Loue. Moreouer we find it thus in Record.\n\nLater, in \"The [[Argument (literature)|Argument]]\" to the ''Testament of Love'', Speght adds:\n::Chaucer did compile this booke as a comfort to himselfe after great griefs conceiued for some rash attempts of the commons, with whome he had ioyned, and thereby was in feare to loose the fauour of his best friends.\n\nSpeght is also the source of the famous tale of Chaucer being fined for beating a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] in [[Fleet Street]], as well as a fictitious [[coat of arms]] and [[family tree]]. Ironically \u2013 and perhaps consciously so \u2013 an introductory, apologetic letter in Speght's edition from [[Francis Beaumont]] defends the unseemly, \"low\", and bawdy bits in Chaucer from an elite, classicist position. Francis Thynne noted some of these inconsistencies in his ''Animadversions'', insisting that Chaucer was not a commoner, and he objected to the friar-beating story. Yet Thynne himself underscores Chaucer's support for popular religious reform, associating Chaucer's views with his father William Thynne's attempts to include ''The Plowman's Tale'' and ''The Pilgrim's Tale'' in the 1532 and 1542 ''Works''.\n\nThe myth of the Protestant Chaucer continues to have a lasting impact on a large body of Chaucerian scholarship. Though it is extremely rare for a modern scholar to suggest Chaucer supported a religious movement that did not exist until more than a century after his death, the predominance of this thinking for so many centuries left it for granted that Chaucer was at least hostile toward Catholicism. This assumption forms a large part of many critical approaches to Chaucer's works, including neo-Marxism.\n\nAlongside Chaucer's ''Works'', the most impressive literary monument of the period is [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Acts and Monuments...]]''. As with the Chaucer editions, it was critically significant to English Protestant identity and included Chaucer in its project. Foxe's Chaucer both derived from and contributed to the printed editions of Chaucer's ''Works'', particularly the pseudepigrapha. ''Jack Upland'' was first printed in Foxe's ''Acts and Monuments'', and then it appeared in Speght's edition of Chaucer's ''Works''. Speght's \"Life of Chaucer\" echoes Foxe's own account, which is itself dependent upon the earlier editions that added the ''Testament of Love'' and ''The Plowman's Tale'' to their pages. Like Speght's Chaucer, Foxe's Chaucer was also a shrewd (or lucky) political survivor. In his 1563 edition, Foxe \"thought it not out of season \u2026 to couple \u2026 some mention of Geoffrey Chaucer\" with a discussion of [[John Colet]], a possible source for [[John Skelton]]'s character [[Colin Clout]].\n\nProbably referring to the 1542 [[Act for the Advancement of True Religion]], Foxe said that he \"marvel[s] to consider \u2026 how the bishops, condemning and abolishing all manner of English books and treatises which might bring the people to any light of knowledge, did yet authorise the works of Chaucer to remain still and to be occupied; who, no doubt, saw into religion as much almost as even we do now, and uttereth in his works no less, and seemeth to be a right Wicklevian, or else there never was any. And that, all his works almost, if they be thoroughly advised, will testify (albeit done in mirth, and covertly); and especially the latter end of his third book of the Testament of Love \u2026 Wherein, except a man be altogether blind, he may espy him at the full: although in the same book (as in all others he useth to do), under shadows covertly, as under a visor, he suborneth truth in such sort, as both privily she may profit the godly-minded, and yet not be espied of the crafty adversary. And therefore the bishops, belike, taking his works but for jests and toys, in condemning other books, yet permitted his books to be read.\"\n\nIt is significant, too, that Foxe's discussion of Chaucer leads into his history of \"The Reformation of the Church of Christ in the Time of Martin Luther\" when \"Printing, being opened, incontinently ministered unto the church the instruments and tools of learning and knowledge; which were good books and authors, which before lay hid and unknown. The science of printing being found, immediately followed the grace of God; which stirred up good wits aptly to conceive the light of knowledge and judgment: by which light darkness began to be espied, and ignorance to be detected; truth from error, religion from superstition, to be discerned.\"\n\nFoxe downplays Chaucer's bawdy and amorous writing, insisting that it all testifies to his piety. Material that is troubling is deemed metaphoric, while the more forthright satire (which Foxe prefers) is taken literally.\n[[File:Chaucer1721.jpg|thumb|left|Spine and Titlepage of the 1721 [[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry edition]] of Chaucer's complete works]]\n\n[[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry]] produced the first edition of the complete works of Chaucer in a Latin font, published posthumously in 1721. Included were several tales, according to the editors, for the first time printed, a biography of Chaucer, a glossary of old English words, and testimonials of author writers concerning Chaucer dating back to the 16th century. According to A. S. G Edwards, \"This was the first collected edition of Chaucer to be printed in roman type. The life of Chaucer prefixed to the volume was the work of the Reverend [[John Dart]], corrected and revised by Timothy Thomas. The glossary appended was also mainly compiled by Thomas. The text of Urry's edition has often been criticised by subsequent editors for its frequent conjectural emendations, mainly to make it conform to his sense of Chaucer's metre. The justice of such criticisms should not obscure his achievement. His is the first edition of Chaucer for nearly a hundred and fifty years to consult any manuscripts and is the first since that of William Thynne in 1534 to seek systematically to assemble a substantial number of manuscripts to establish his text. It is also the first edition to offer descriptions of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works, and the first to print texts of 'Gamelyn' and 'The Tale of Beryn', works ascribed to, but not by, Chaucer.\"\n\n===Modern scholarship===\nAlthough Chaucer's works had long been admired, serious scholarly work on his legacy did not begin until the late 18th century, when [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] edited ''The Canterbury Tales'', and it did not become an established academic discipline until the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Chaucer: The Critical Heritage.

[[Walter William Skeat]], who like Furnivall was closely associated with the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', established the base text of all of Chaucer's works with his edition, published by Oxford University Press. Later editions by John H. Fisher and Larry D. Benson offered further refinements, along with critical commentary and bibliographies.\n\nWith the textual issues largely addressed, if not resolved, attention turned to the questions of Chaucer's themes, structure, and audience. The ''Chaucer Review'' was founded in 1966 and has maintained its position as the pre-eminent journal of Chaucer studies.\n\n==List of works==\nThe following major works are in rough chronological order but scholars still debate the dating of most of Chaucer's output and works made up from a collection of stories may have been compiled over a long period.\n\n===Major works===\n*Translation of ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', possibly extant as ''[[The Romaunt of the Rose]]''\n*''[[The Book of the Duchess]]''\n*''[[The House of Fame]]''\n*''[[Anelida and Arcite]]''\n*''[[Parlement of Foules]]''\n*Translation of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' as ''[[Boece (Chaucer)|Boece]]''\n*''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''\n*''[[The Legend of Good Women]]''\n*''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''\n*''[[A Treatise on the Astrolabe]]''\n\n===Short poems===\n[[File:Balade to Rosemounde.jpg|thumb|''Balade to Rosemounde'']]\n*''An ABC''\n*''Chaucers Wordes unto Adam, His Owne Scriveyn'' (disputed)<ref>Weiskott, Eric. \"''Adam Scriveyn'' and Chaucer's Metrical Practice.\" ''Medium \u00c6vum'' 86 (2017): 147\u201351.</ref>\n*''The Complaint unto Pity''\n*''The Complaint of Chaucer to his Purse''\n*''[[The Complaint of Mars]]''\n*''The Complaint of Venus''\n*''A Complaint to His Lady''\n*''The Former Age''\n*''Fortune''\n*''Gentilesse''\n*''Lak of Stedfastnesse''\n*''Lenvoy de Chaucer a Scogan''\n*''Lenvoy de Chaucer a Bukton''\n*''Proverbs''\n*''Balade to Rosemounde''\n*''Truth''\n*''Womanly Noblesse''\n\n===Poems of doubtful authorship===\n*''Against Women Unconstant''\n*''A Balade of Complaint''\n*''Complaynt D'Amours''\n*''Merciles Beaute''\n*''The Equatorie of the Planets''&nbsp;\u2013 A rough translation of a Latin work derived from an Arab work of the same title.

The similar ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'', not usually doubted as Chaucer's work, in addition to Chaucer's name as a gloss to the manuscript are the main pieces of evidence for the ascription to Chaucer.

In the City Hustings Roll 110, 5, Ric II, dated June 1380, Chaucer refers to himself as ''me Galfridum Chaucer, filium Johannis Chaucer, Vinetarii, Londonie'', which translates as: \"Geoffrey Chaucer, son of John Chaucer, vintners, London\".\n\n==Career==\nWhile records concerning the lives of his contemporaries, [[William Langland]] and the [[Pearl Poet]], are practically non-existent, since Chaucer was a public servant, his official life is very well documented, with nearly five hundred written items testifying to his career.

Around 1366, Chaucer married [[Philippa (de) Roet]]. She was a lady-in-waiting to Edward III's queen, [[Philippa of Hainault]], and a sister of [[Katherine Swynford]], who later (c. 1396) became the third wife of [[John of Gaunt]].

He became a member of the royal court of Edward III as a ''[[valet de chambre]]'', [[yeoman]], or [[esquire]] on 20 June 1367, a position which could entail a wide variety of tasks. His wife also received a pension for court employment. He travelled abroad many times, at least some of them in his role as a valet. In 1368, he may have attended the wedding of [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp]] to [[Violante Visconti]], daughter of [[Galeazzo II Visconti]], in [[Milan]]. Two other literary stars of the era were in attendance: [[Jean Froissart]] and [[Petrarch]]. Around this time, Chaucer is believed to have written ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' in honour of [[Blanche of Lancaster]], the late wife of John of Gaunt, who died in 1369 of the plague.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Holt Literature and Language Arts |last= |first= |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |year=2003 |isbn=978-0030573743 |location= |pages=113}}</ref>\n\nChaucer travelled to [[Picardy]] the next year as part of a military expedition; in 1373 he visited [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]].

Later documents suggest it was a mission, along with Jean Froissart, to arrange a marriage between the future King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and a French princess, thereby ending the [[Hundred Years War]]. If this was the purpose of their trip, they seem to have been unsuccessful, as no wedding occurred.\n\nIn 1378, Richard II sent Chaucer as an envoy (secret dispatch) to the Visconti and to Sir [[John Hawkwood]], English [[condottiere]] (mercenary leader) in [[Milan]]. It has been speculated that it was Hawkwood on whom Chaucer based his character the Knight in the ''Canterbury Tales'', for a description matches that of a 14th-century condottiere.\n\n[[File:Geoffrey Chaucer.jpeg|left|thumb|A 19th-century depiction of Chaucer]]\nA possible indication that his career as a writer was appreciated came when [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] granted Chaucer \"a gallon of wine daily for the rest of his life\" for some unspecified task. This was an unusual grant, but given on a day of celebration, [[St George's Day]], 1374, when artistic endeavours were traditionally rewarded, it is assumed to have been another early poetic work. It is not known which, if any, of Chaucer's extant works prompted the reward, but the suggestion of him as poet to a king places him as a precursor to later [[poets laureate]]. Chaucer continued to collect the liquid stipend until Richard II came to power, after which it was converted to a monetary grant on 18 April 1378.\n\nChaucer obtained the very substantial job of [[comptroller]] of the customs for the port of London, which he began on 8 June 1374.<ref>Morley, Henry (1890) ''English Writers: an attempt towards a history of English literature''.

He is thought to have started work on ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the early 1380s. He also became a member of parliament for Kent in 1386, and attended the '[[Wonderful Parliament]]' that year.

The phrase \"long castel\" is a reference to Lancaster (also called \"Loncastel\" and \"Longcastell\"), \"walles white\" is thought to be an oblique reference to Blanche, \"Seynt Johan\" was John of Gaunt's name-saint, and \"ryche hil\" is a reference to Richmond. These references reveal the identity of the grieving black knight of the poem as John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Richmond. \"White\" is the English translation of the French word \"blanche\", implying that the white lady was [[Blanche of Lancaster]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Riverside Chaucer |last1=Wilcockson |first1=Colin |editor1-last=Benson |editor1-first=Larry D. |editor2-last=Pratt |editor2-first=Robert |editor3-last=Robinson |editor3-first=F.

''Fortune'', in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes that she has been kind to him, claims that he does not know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, \"And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve\" (32, 40, 48). Chaucer retorts, \"My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse\" (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends. ''Fortune'' turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and \"Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne\" (78\u201379). The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|York]], and [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Gloucester]], and a portion of line 76 (\"as three of you or tweyne\") is thought to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of at least two of the three dukes.<ref name=\"Gross, Zaila 1987 635\" /> Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's \"beste frend\". ''Fortune'' states three times in her response to the plaintiff, \"And also, you still have your best friend alive\" (32, 40, 48); she also refers to his \"beste frend\" in the envoy when appealing to his \"noblesse\" to help Chaucer to a higher estate. The narrator makes a fifth reference when he rails at ''Fortune'' that she shall not take his friend from him.\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nChaucer's attitudes toward the Church should not be confused with his attitudes toward Christianity.

B. McCully and J. J. Anderson, ''English Historical Metrics'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 97.</ref> Chaucer is known for metrical innovation, inventing the [[rhyme royal]], and he was one of the first English poets to use the five-stress line, a decasyllabic cousin to the [[iambic pentameter]], in his work, with only a few anonymous short works using it before him.<ref>[[Marchette Chute]], ''Geoffrey Chaucer of England'' E. P. Dutton, 1946, p. 89.</ref> The arrangement of these five-stress lines into rhyming [[couplet]]s, first seen in his ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', was used in much of his later work and became one of the standard poetic forms in English. His early influence as a satirist is also important, with the common humorous device, the funny accent of a regional [[dialect]], apparently making its first appearance in ''[[The Reeve's Tale]]''.\n\nThe poetry of Chaucer, along with other writers of the era, is credited with helping to standardise the London Dialect of the [[Middle English]] language from a combination of the Kentish and Midlands dialects.<ref>Edwin Winfield Bowen, ''Questions at Issue in our English Speech'', NY: Broadway Publishing, 1909, p. 147.</ref> This is probably overstated; the influence of the court, [[Lord Chancellor|chancery]] and bureaucracy \u2013 of which Chaucer was a part \u2013 remains a more probable influence on the development of [[Standard English]]. [[Modern English]] is somewhat distanced from the language of Chaucer's poems owing to the effect of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] some time after his death. This change in the [[pronunciation]] of English, still not fully understood, makes the reading of Chaucer difficult for the modern audience. The status of the final ''-e'' in Chaucer's verse is uncertain: it seems likely that during the period of Chaucer's writing the final ''-e'' was dropping out of colloquial English and that its use was somewhat irregular. Chaucer's versification suggests that the final ''-e'' is sometimes to be vocalised, and sometimes to be silent; however, this remains a point on which there is disagreement. When it is vocalised, most scholars pronounce it as a [[schwa]]. Apart from the irregular spelling, much of the vocabulary is recognisable to the modern reader. Chaucer is also recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as the first author to use many common English words in his writings. These words were probably frequently used in the language at the time but Chaucer, with his ear for common speech, is the earliest extant manuscript source. ''Acceptable'', ''alkali'', ''altercation'', ''amble'', ''angrily'', ''annex'', ''annoyance'', ''approaching'', ''arbitration'', ''armless'', ''army'', ''arrogant'', ''arsenic'', ''arc'', ''artillery'' and ''aspect'' are just some of the many [[English words first attested in Chaucer]].\n\n===Literary===\nWidespread knowledge of Chaucer's works is attested by the many poets who imitated or responded to his writing. [[John Lydgate]] was one of the earliest poets to write continuations of Chaucer's unfinished ''Tales'' while [[Robert Henryson]]'s ''Testament of Cresseid'' completes the story of [[Cressida]] left unfinished in his ''Troilus and Criseyde''. Many of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works contain material from these poets and later appreciations by the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] poets were shaped by their failure to distinguish the later \"additions\" from original Chaucer. Writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as [[John Dryden]], admired Chaucer for his stories, but not for his rhythm and rhyme, as few critics could then read Middle English and the text had been butchered by printers, leaving a somewhat unadmirable mess.<ref>\"From The Preface to ''Fables Ancient and Modern''\".

Roughly seventy-five years after Chaucer's death, ''The Canterbury Tales'' was selected by [[William Caxton]] to be one of the first books to be printed in England.\n\n===English===\nChaucer is sometimes considered the source of the English vernacular tradition. His achievement for the language can be seen as part of a general historical trend towards the creation of a [[vernacular literature]], after the example of [[Dante]], in many parts of Europe. A parallel trend in Chaucer's own lifetime was underway in Scotland through the work of his slightly earlier contemporary, [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]], and was likely to have been even more general, as is evidenced by the example of the [[Pearl Poet]] in the north of England.\n\nAlthough Chaucer's language is much closer to Modern English than the text of ''[[Beowulf]]'', such that (unlike that of ''Beowulf'') a Modern English-speaker with a large vocabulary of archaic words may understand it, it differs enough that most publications modernise his idiom. The following is a sample from the prologue of ''[[The Summoner's Tale]]'' that compares Chaucer's text to a modern translation:\n\n:{| cellspacing=\"4\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n| || ''Original Text'' || ''Modern Translation''\n|-\n| || This frere bosteth that he knoweth helle,\n| This friar boasts that he knows hell,\n|-\n| || And God it woot, that it is litel wonder;\n| And God knows that it is little wonder;\n|-\n| || Freres and feendes been but lyte asonder.\n| Friars and fiends are seldom far apart.\n|-\n| || For, pardee, ye han ofte tyme herd telle\n| For, by God, you have ofttimes heard tell\n|-\n|  || How that a frere ravyshed was to helle\n| How a friar was taken to hell\n|-\n| || In spirit ones by a visioun;\n| In spirit, once by a vision;\n|-\n| || And as an angel ladde hym up and doun,\n| And as an angel led him up and down,\n|-\n|  || To shewen hym the peynes that the were,\n| To show him the pains that were there,\n|-\n| || In al the place saugh he nat a frere;\n| In all the place he saw not a friar;\n|-\n| || Of oother folk he saugh ynowe in wo.\n| Of other folk he saw enough in woe.\n|-\n|  || Unto this angel spak the frere tho:\n| Unto this angel spoke the friar thus:\n|-\n| || Now, sire, quod he, han freres swich a grace     \n| \"Now sir\", said he, \"Have friars such a grace\n|-\n| || That noon of hem shal come to this place?\n| That none of them come to this place?\"\n|-\n| || Yis, quod this aungel, many a millioun!\n| \"Yes\", said the angel, \"many a million!\"\n|-\n| || And unto sathanas he ladde hym doun.\n| And unto Satan the angel led him down.\n|-\n| || \u2013And now hath sathanas, \u2013seith he, \u2013a tayl\n| \"And now Satan has\", he said, \"a tail,\n|-\n|  || Brodder than of a carryk is the sayl.\n| Broader than a galleon's sail.\n|-\n| || Hold up thy tayl, thou sathanas!\u2013quod he;\n| Hold up your tail, Satan!\" said he.\n|-\n| || \u2013shewe forth thyn ers, and lat the frere se\n| \"Show forth your arse, and let the friar see\n|-\n| || Where is the nest of freres in this place!\u2013\n| Where the nest of friars is in this place!\"\n|-\n| || And er that half a furlong wey of space,\n| And before half a furlong of space,\n|-\n| || Right so as bees out swarmen from an hyve,    \n| Just as bees swarm out from a hive,\n|-\n| ||Out of the develes ers ther gonne dryve\n| Out of the devil's arse there were driven\n|-\n| || Twenty thousand freres on a route,\n| Twenty thousand friars on a rout,\n|-\n| || And thurghout helle swarmed al aboute,\n| And throughout hell swarmed all about,\n|-\n| || And comen agayn as faste as they may gon,    \n| And came again as fast as they could go,\n|-\n| || And in his ers they crepten everychon.\n| And every one crept into his arse.\n|-\n|  ||He clapte his tayl agayn and lay ful stille.\n| He shut his tail again and lay very still.<ref>Original e-text available online at the [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Cha2Can.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/lv1/Archive/mideng-parsed&tag=public&part=17&division=div2 University of Virginia website], trans.

There are 83 surviving manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales (in whole or part) alone, along with sixteen of ''Troilus and Criseyde'', including the personal copy of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]].<ref>Benson, Larry, ''The Riverside Chaucer'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1987), p. 1118.</ref> Given the ravages of time, it is likely that these surviving manuscripts represent hundreds since lost. Chaucer's original audience was a courtly one, and would have included women as well as men of the upper social classes. Yet even before his death in 1400, Chaucer's audience had begun to include members of the rising literate, middle and merchant classes, which included many [[Lollard]] sympathisers who may well have been inclined to read Chaucer as one of their own, particularly in his satirical writings about friars, priests, and other church officials. In 1464, John Baron, a tenant farmer in Agmondesham ([[Amersham]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]), was brought before [[John Chadworth]], the Bishop of Lincoln, on charges of being a Lollard heretic; he confessed to owning a \"boke of the Tales of Caunterburie\" among other suspect volumes.<ref>Potter, Russell A., \"Chaucer and the Authority of Language: The Politics and Poetics of the Vernacular in Late Medieval England\", ''Assays'' VI (Carnegie-Mellon Press, 1991), p. 91.</ref>\n\n===Printed editions===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2017}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[William Caxton]], the first English printer, was responsible for the first two [[folio]] editions of ''The Canterbury Tales'' which were published in 1478 and 1483.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg076.htm |title=A Leaf from The Canterbury Tales | location=Westminster, England \n| publisher=William Caxton | year=1473 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031075730/http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg076.htm |archivedate=31 October 2005}}</ref> Caxton's second printing, by his own account, came about because a customer complained that the printed text differed from a manuscript he knew; Caxton obligingly used the man's manuscript as his source. Both Caxton editions carry the equivalent of manuscript authority. Caxton's edition was reprinted by his successor, [[Wynkyn de Worde]], but this edition has no independent authority.\n \n[[Richard Pynson]], the [[King's Printer]] under Henry VIII for about twenty years, was the first to collect and sell something that resembled an edition of the collected works of Chaucer; however, in the process, he introduced five previously printed texts that are now known not to be Chaucer's. (The collection is actually three separately printed texts, or collections of texts, bound together as one volume.) There is a likely connection between Pynson's product and [[William Thynne]]'s a mere six years later. Thynne had a successful career from the 1520s until his death in 1546, as chief clerk of the kitchen of Henry VIII, one of the masters of the royal household. He spent years comparing various versions of Chaucer's works, and selected 41 pieces for publication. While there were questions over the authorship of some of the material, there is not doubt this was the first comprehensive view of Chaucer's work. ''The Workes of Geffray Chaucer,'' published in 1532, was the first edition of Chaucer's collected works. His editions of ''Chaucer's Works'' in 1532 and 1542 were the first major contributions to the existence of a widely recognised Chaucerian [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]. Thynne represents his edition as a book sponsored by and supportive of the king who is praised in the preface by [[Sir Brian Tuke]]. Thynne's canon brought the number of apocryphal works associated with Chaucer to a total of 28, even if that was not his intention.<ref name=Stow1561 /> As with Pynson, once included in the ''Works'', [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]] texts stayed with those works, regardless of their first editor's intentions.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, Chaucer was printed more than any other English author, and he was the first author to have his works collected in comprehensive single-volume editions in which a Chaucer [[wikt:canon|canon]] began to cohere. Some scholars contend that 16th-century editions of Chaucer's ''Works'' set the precedent for all other English authors in terms of presentation, prestige and success in print. These editions certainly established Chaucer's reputation, but they also began the complicated process of reconstructing and frequently inventing Chaucer's biography and the canonical list of works which were attributed to him.\n\nProbably the most significant aspect of the growing [[apocrypha]] is that, beginning with Thynne's editions, it began to include medieval texts that made Chaucer appear as a [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestant]] [[Lollard]], primarily the ''[[Testament of Love]]'' and ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]''. As \"Chaucerian\" works that were not considered apocryphal until the late 19th century, these medieval texts enjoyed a new life, with English Protestants carrying on the earlier Lollard project of appropriating existing texts and authors who seemed sympathetic\u2014or malleable enough to be construed as sympathetic\u2014to their cause. The official Chaucer of the early printed volumes of his ''Works'' was construed as a proto-Protestant as the same was done, concurrently, with [[William Langland]] and ''[[Piers Plowman]]''.\n\nThe famous ''Plowman's Tale'' did not enter Thynne's ''Works'' until the second, 1542, edition. Its entry was surely facilitated by Thynne's inclusion of [[Thomas Usk]]'s ''Testament of Love'' in the first edition. The ''Testament of Love'' imitates, borrows from, and thus resembles Usk's contemporary, Chaucer. (''Testament of Love'' also appears to borrow from ''Piers Plowman''.) Since the ''Testament of Love'' mentions its author's part in a failed plot (book 1, chapter 6), his imprisonment, and (perhaps) a recantation of (possibly Lollard) heresy, all this was associated with Chaucer. (Usk himself was executed as a traitor in 1388.) [[John Foxe]] took this recantation of heresy as a defence of the true faith, calling Chaucer a \"right Wiclevian\" and (erroneously) identifying him as a schoolmate and close friend of [[John Wycliffe]] at [[Merton College, Oxford]]. ([[Thomas Speght]] is careful to highlight these facts in his editions and his \"Life of Chaucer\".) No other sources for the ''Testament of Love'' exist\u2014there is only Thynne's construction of whatever manuscript sources he had.\n\n[[John Stow]] (1525\u20131605) was an antiquarian and also a chronicler. His edition of Chaucer's ''Works'' in 1561<ref name=Stow1561>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg077.htm |title=UWM.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111220719/http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg077.htm |archivedate=11 November 2005}}</ref> brought the apocrypha to more than 50 titles. More were added in the 17th century, and they remained as late as 1810, well after [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] pared the canon down in his 1775 edition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg079.htm |title=The Canterbury Tales of Chaucer: To Which are Added an Essay on his Language and Versification, and an Introductory Discourse, Together with Notes and a Glossary by the late Thomas Tyrwhitt.

What was added to Chaucer often helped represent him favourably to Protestant England.\n\n[[File:Chaucer 1602.jpg|thumb|Engraving of Chaucer from [[Thomas Speght|Speght's]] edition. The two top shields display: ''Per pale argent and gules, a bend counterchanged'' (Chaucer), that at bottom left: ''Gules, three [[Breaking wheel|Catherine Wheels]] or'' (Roet, [[canting arms]], French ''rouet'' = \"spinning wheel\"), and that at bottom right displays Roet quartering ''Argent, a chief gules overall a lion rampant double queued or'' (Chaucer) with crest of Chaucer above: ''A unicorn head'']]\n\nIn his 1598 edition of the ''Works'', Speght (probably taking cues from Foxe) made good use of Usk's account of his political intrigue and imprisonment in the ''Testament of Love'' to assemble a largely fictional \"Life of Our Learned English Poet, Geffrey Chaucer\". Speght's \"Life\" presents readers with an erstwhile radical in troubled times much like their own, a proto-Protestant who eventually came round to the king's views on religion. Speght states, \"In the second year of Richard the second, the King tooke Geffrey Chaucer and his lands into his protection. The occasion wherof no doubt was some daunger and trouble whereinto he was fallen by favouring some rash attempt of the common people.\" Under the discussion of Chaucer's friends, namely John of Gaunt, Speght further explains:\n\n::Yet it seemeth that [Chaucer] was in some trouble in the daies of King Richard the second, as it may appeare in the Testament of Loue: where hee doth greatly complaine of his owne rashnesse in following the multitude, and of their hatred against him for bewraying their purpose. And in that complaint which he maketh to his empty purse, I do find a written copy, which I had of Iohn Stow (whose library hath helped many writers) wherein ten times more is adioined, then is in print. Where he maketh great lamentation for his wrongfull imprisonment, wishing death to end his daies: which in my iudgement doth greatly accord with that in the Testament of Loue. Moreouer we find it thus in Record.\n\nLater, in \"The [[Argument (literature)|Argument]]\" to the ''Testament of Love'', Speght adds:\n::Chaucer did compile this booke as a comfort to himselfe after great griefs conceiued for some rash attempts of the commons, with whome he had ioyned, and thereby was in feare to loose the fauour of his best friends.\n\nSpeght is also the source of the famous tale of Chaucer being fined for beating a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] in [[Fleet Street]], as well as a fictitious [[coat of arms]] and [[family tree]]. Ironically \u2013 and perhaps consciously so \u2013 an introductory, apologetic letter in Speght's edition from [[Francis Beaumont]] defends the unseemly, \"low\", and bawdy bits in Chaucer from an elite, classicist position. Francis Thynne noted some of these inconsistencies in his ''Animadversions'', insisting that Chaucer was not a commoner, and he objected to the friar-beating story. Yet Thynne himself underscores Chaucer's support for popular religious reform, associating Chaucer's views with his father William Thynne's attempts to include ''The Plowman's Tale'' and ''The Pilgrim's Tale'' in the 1532 and 1542 ''Works''.\n\nThe myth of the Protestant Chaucer continues to have a lasting impact on a large body of Chaucerian scholarship. Though it is extremely rare for a modern scholar to suggest Chaucer supported a religious movement that did not exist until more than a century after his death, the predominance of this thinking for so many centuries left it for granted that Chaucer was at least hostile toward Catholicism. This assumption forms a large part of many critical approaches to Chaucer's works, including neo-Marxism.\n\nAlongside Chaucer's ''Works'', the most impressive literary monument of the period is [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Acts and Monuments...]]''. As with the Chaucer editions, it was critically significant to English Protestant identity and included Chaucer in its project. Foxe's Chaucer both derived from and contributed to the printed editions of Chaucer's ''Works'', particularly the pseudepigrapha. ''Jack Upland'' was first printed in Foxe's ''Acts and Monuments'', and then it appeared in Speght's edition of Chaucer's ''Works''. Speght's \"Life of Chaucer\" echoes Foxe's own account, which is itself dependent upon the earlier editions that added the ''Testament of Love'' and ''The Plowman's Tale'' to their pages. Like Speght's Chaucer, Foxe's Chaucer was also a shrewd (or lucky) political survivor. In his 1563 edition, Foxe \"thought it not out of season \u2026 to couple \u2026 some mention of Geoffrey Chaucer\" with a discussion of [[John Colet]], a possible source for [[John Skelton]]'s character [[Colin Clout]].\n\nProbably referring to the 1542 [[Act for the Advancement of True Religion]], Foxe said that he \"marvel[s] to consider \u2026 how the bishops, condemning and abolishing all manner of English books and treatises which might bring the people to any light of knowledge, did yet authorise the works of Chaucer to remain still and to be occupied; who, no doubt, saw into religion as much almost as even we do now, and uttereth in his works no less, and seemeth to be a right Wicklevian, or else there never was any. And that, all his works almost, if they be thoroughly advised, will testify (albeit done in mirth, and covertly); and especially the latter end of his third book of the Testament of Love \u2026 Wherein, except a man be altogether blind, he may espy him at the full: although in the same book (as in all others he useth to do), under shadows covertly, as under a visor, he suborneth truth in such sort, as both privily she may profit the godly-minded, and yet not be espied of the crafty adversary. And therefore the bishops, belike, taking his works but for jests and toys, in condemning other books, yet permitted his books to be read.\"\n\nIt is significant, too, that Foxe's discussion of Chaucer leads into his history of \"The Reformation of the Church of Christ in the Time of Martin Luther\" when \"Printing, being opened, incontinently ministered unto the church the instruments and tools of learning and knowledge; which were good books and authors, which before lay hid and unknown. The science of printing being found, immediately followed the grace of God; which stirred up good wits aptly to conceive the light of knowledge and judgment: by which light darkness began to be espied, and ignorance to be detected; truth from error, religion from superstition, to be discerned.\"\n\nFoxe downplays Chaucer's bawdy and amorous writing, insisting that it all testifies to his piety. Material that is troubling is deemed metaphoric, while the more forthright satire (which Foxe prefers) is taken literally.\n[[File:Chaucer1721.jpg|thumb|left|Spine and Titlepage of the 1721 [[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry edition]] of Chaucer's complete works]]\n\n[[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry]] produced the first edition of the complete works of Chaucer in a Latin font, published posthumously in 1721. Included were several tales, according to the editors, for the first time printed, a biography of Chaucer, a glossary of old English words, and testimonials of author writers concerning Chaucer dating back to the 16th century. According to A. S. G Edwards, \"This was the first collected edition of Chaucer to be printed in roman type. The life of Chaucer prefixed to the volume was the work of the Reverend [[John Dart]], corrected and revised by Timothy Thomas. The glossary appended was also mainly compiled by Thomas. The text of Urry's edition has often been criticised by subsequent editors for its frequent conjectural emendations, mainly to make it conform to his sense of Chaucer's metre. The justice of such criticisms should not obscure his achievement. His is the first edition of Chaucer for nearly a hundred and fifty years to consult any manuscripts and is the first since that of William Thynne in 1534 to seek systematically to assemble a substantial number of manuscripts to establish his text. It is also the first edition to offer descriptions of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works, and the first to print texts of 'Gamelyn' and 'The Tale of Beryn', works ascribed to, but not by, Chaucer.\"\n\n===Modern scholarship===\nAlthough Chaucer's works had long been admired, serious scholarly work on his legacy did not begin until the late 18th century, when [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] edited ''The Canterbury Tales'', and it did not become an established academic discipline until the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Chaucer: The Critical Heritage.

[[Walter William Skeat]], who like Furnivall was closely associated with the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', established the base text of all of Chaucer's works with his edition, published by Oxford University Press. Later editions by John H. Fisher and Larry D. Benson offered further refinements, along with critical commentary and bibliographies.\n\nWith the textual issues largely addressed, if not resolved, attention turned to the questions of Chaucer's themes, structure, and audience. The ''Chaucer Review'' was founded in 1966 and has maintained its position as the pre-eminent journal of Chaucer studies.\n\n==List of works==\nThe following major works are in rough chronological order but scholars still debate the dating of most of Chaucer's output and works made up from a collection of stories may have been compiled over a long period.\n\n===Major works===\n*Translation of ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', possibly extant as ''[[The Romaunt of the Rose]]''\n*''[[The Book of the Duchess]]''\n*''[[The House of Fame]]''\n*''[[Anelida and Arcite]]''\n*''[[Parlement of Foules]]''\n*Translation of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' as ''[[Boece (Chaucer)|Boece]]''\n*''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''\n*''[[The Legend of Good Women]]''\n*''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''\n*''[[A Treatise on the Astrolabe]]''\n\n===Short poems===\n[[File:Balade to Rosemounde.jpg|thumb|''Balade to Rosemounde'']]\n*''An ABC''\n*''Chaucers Wordes unto Adam, His Owne Scriveyn'' (disputed)<ref>Weiskott, Eric. \"''Adam Scriveyn'' and Chaucer's Metrical Practice.\" ''Medium \u00c6vum'' 86 (2017): 147\u201351.</ref>\n*''The Complaint unto Pity''\n*''The Complaint of Chaucer to his Purse''\n*''[[The Complaint of Mars]]''\n*''The Complaint of Venus''\n*''A Complaint to His Lady''\n*''The Former Age''\n*''Fortune''\n*''Gentilesse''\n*''Lak of Stedfastnesse''\n*''Lenvoy de Chaucer a Scogan''\n*''Lenvoy de Chaucer a Bukton''\n*''Proverbs''\n*''Balade to Rosemounde''\n*''Truth''\n*''Womanly Noblesse''\n\n===Poems of doubtful authorship===\n*''Against Women Unconstant''\n*''A Balade of Complaint''\n*''Complaynt D'Amours''\n*''Merciles Beaute''\n*''The Equatorie of the Planets''&nbsp;\u2013 A rough translation of a Latin work derived from an Arab work of the same title.

The similar ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'', not usually doubted as Chaucer's work, in addition to Chaucer's name as a gloss to the manuscript are the main pieces of evidence for the ascription to Chaucer.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Her work was integral to British Magazine ''[[The New Age]]'' which she helped edit along with her lover, [[A. R. Orage]], prior to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. Hastings was also friend and lover of [[Katherine Mansfield]], whose work was first published in ''The New Age''.<ref>Edensor, Louise. (2016). ''Une profession de foi pour tourjours: Katherine Mansfield and Beatrice Hastings in France''. In Claire Davison, Gerri Kimber. ''Katherine Mansfield\u2019s French Lives''.

''The Craft of Literary Biography''. p. 118</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\nBeatrice Hastings was born in London but grew up in [[Port Elizabeth]], South Africa. She was educated in Pevensey, Kent, near [[Hastings]], which may have supplied her chosen name.<ref>Robert Scholes, Modernist Journals Project https://modjourn.org/biography/hastings-beatrice-emily-alice-haigh-1879-1943/</ref>. \n\nIn 1907 she met [[A. R. Orage]], the editor of [[The New Age]] magazine, with whom she embarked on a romantic relationship. Hastings soon began contributing to the magazine and went on to become one of its most prolific contributors, although most of her work appeared under [[pseudonyms]]. These include: Pagan, Alice Morning, A.M.A., E.H., B.L.H., Beatrice Tina, Cynicus, Robert a Field, T.K.L., D. Triformis, Edward Stafford, S. Robert West, V.M., G. Whiz, J. Wilson, Annette Doorly, Hastings Lloyd, Mrs. Malaprop, and T.W. <ref>Robert Scholes, Modernist Journals Project https://modjourn.org/biography/hastings-beatrice-emily-alice-haigh-1879-1943/</ref>. \n\nHastings' work for ''The New Age'' spanned many different forms and genres, including items of correspondence, parody, poetry, polemic, travel writing, prose fiction, and dramatic dialogue. She described herself in one instance as 'a minor poet of the first class.'<ref>Beatrice Hastings, \u2018Two Reviews\u2019, The New Age, 13.26 (October 23rd, 1913) , p.759.</ref>. One of Hastings' greatest talents was parody, and she composed parodies of many her contemporaries, including [[Ezra Pound]], [[Filippo Marinetti]], and  [[H.G. Wells]].<ref>See: \"T.K.L.\", 'The Way Back to America' (NA 13.21); \"T.K.L.\", 'Wake Up, England!\" (NA 15.8), \"B.H. and K.M.\", 'A P.S.A.' (NA 9.4)</ref>. Hastings was also outspoken in her feminist views and ''The New Age'' correspondence section provided the space in which she developed many of the ideas which would inform her 1909 feminist tract, ''Woman's Worst Enemy: Woman''. \n\nIn 1914 Hastings moved to Paris and became a figure in bohemian circles due to her friendship with [[Max Jacob]]. She shared an apartment in [[Montparnasse]] with [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and became a model for countless paintings, including his 1916 ''[[Seated Nude (1916)|Seated Nude]]''. Another friend was adventure novelist [[Charles Beadle]], with whom she had several things in common. He grew up in Hackney, spent time in South Africa (participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police), and published several novels about [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life in Paris. When Beadle came to America, from Paris, in November 1916, he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris.\n\nTowards the end of her life Hastings felt excluded from the literary recognition she felt her due, and blamed Orage, whom she accused of conspiring to keep her out of literary circles in Britain. She published a pamphlet, ''The Old New Age'' (1936), in which she bitterly criticised Orage, calling him 'a rustic, a lout, a snob\u2019.<ref>Beatrice Hastings, The Old New Age: Orage and Others (London: Blue Moon Press, 1936), p.18</ref>. Hastings claimed that she \u2018offended Orage\u2019s masculine amour-propre, and for this, was made the victim of a social cabale [\u2026] a literary boycott that does, or should, matter to every reading person\u2019.<ref>Hastings, The Old New Age, p.3</ref>. While many of the contents of this pamphlet are thought to be exaggerated, it nevertheless shines a light on Orage's already well-documented misogyny, and the experience of being a female author in the 1910s.\n\nIn 1943, probably suffering from cancer, she killed herself with gas from a domestic cooker.\n\n== Posthumous Recognition ==\n\nAlthough in her lifetime Hastings was regarded as a relatively minor literary figure, more recently she has been praised for her innovative use of pseudonyms and her pioneering feminist views.\n\nWallace Martin mentions her in his seminal study of [[The New Age]], commenting that \u2018Beatrice Hastings displayed amazing versatility as reviewer, poet, and satirist; she was most effective, albeit unnecessarily malicious, in the last capacity.\u2019<ref>Wallace Martin, The New Age Under Orage: Chapters in English Cultural History (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1967), p.125.</ref> \n\nLiterary critic [[Robert Scholes]] has noted that \"Hastings, who was an important presence on the ''New Age'' editorial staff before the war, had an unhappy life that ended in suicide, never receiving the recognition as a writer that she sought.\"<ref>[[Robert Scholes|Scholes, Robert]]. (2008). ''Paradoxy of Modernism''. Yale University Press. p. 222. {{ISBN|978-0-300-10820-0}}</ref>\n\n==Theosophy==\n\nHastings was a convert to [[Theosophical Society|Theosophy]]. She attempted to defend [[Helena Blavatsky]] from charges of fraud and [[plagiarism]]. In 1937, she published two volumes entitled, ''Defence of Madame Blavatsky''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gomes |first=Michael |title=Beatrice Hastings and the Defence of Madame Blavatsky |url=http://www.theosophycanada.com/files/hastings-solovyoff-fraud.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2017 |url-status= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228170602/http://www.theosophycanada.com/files/hastings-solovyoff-fraud.pdf |archivedate=28 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHer writings on Theosophy have been criticized by [[Skepticism|skeptics]]. Biographer Peter Washington suggested that Hastings \"suffered from delusions of literary grandeur.\"<ref>Washington, Peter. (1995).

She shared an apartment in [[Montparnasse]] with [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and became a model for countless paintings, including his 1916 ''[[Seated Nude (1916)|Seated Nude]]''. Another friend was adventure novelist [[Charles Beadle]], with whom she had several things in common. He grew up in Hackney, spent time in South Africa (participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police), and published several novels about [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life in Paris. When Beadle came to America, from Paris, in November 1916, he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris.\n\nTowards the end of her life Hastings felt excluded from the literary recognition she felt her due, and blamed Orage, whom she accused of conspiring to keep her out of literary circles in Britain. She published a pamphlet, ''The Old New Age'' (1936), in which she bitterly criticised Orage, calling him 'a rustic, a lout, a snob\u2019.<ref>Beatrice Hastings, The Old New Age: Orage and Others (London: Blue Moon Press, 1936), p.18</ref>. Hastings claimed that she \u2018offended Orage\u2019s masculine amour-propre, and for this, was made the victim of a social cabale [\u2026] a literary boycott that does, or should, matter to every reading person\u2019.<ref>Hastings, The Old New Age, p.3</ref>. While many of the contents of this pamphlet are thought to be exaggerated, it nevertheless shines a light on Orage's already well-documented misogyny, and the experience of being a female author in the 1910s.\n\nIn 1943, probably suffering from cancer, she killed herself with gas from a domestic cooker.\n\n== Posthumous Recognition ==\n\nAlthough in her lifetime, Hastings was regarded as a relatively minor literary figure, more recently she has been praised for her innovative use of pseudonyms and her pioneering feminist views.\n\nWallace Martin mentions her in his seminal study of [[The New Age]], commenting that \u2018Beatrice Hastings displayed amazing versatility as reviewer, poet, and satirist; she was most effective, albeit unnecessarily malicious, in the last capacity.\u2019<ref>Wallace Martin, The New Age Under Orage: Chapters in English Cultural History (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1967), p.125.</ref> \n\nLiterary critic [[Robert Scholes]] has noted that \"Hastings, who was an important presence on the ''New Age'' editorial staff before the war, had an unhappy life that ended in suicide, never receiving the recognition as a writer that she sought.\"<ref>[[Robert Scholes|Scholes, Robert]]. (2008). ''Paradoxy of Modernism''. Yale University Press. p. 222. {{ISBN|978-0-300-10820-0}}</ref>\n\n==Theosophy==\n\nHastings was a convert to [[Theosophical Society|Theosophy]]. She attempted to defend [[Helena Blavatsky]] from charges of fraud and [[plagiarism]]. In 1937, she published two volumes entitled, ''Defence of Madame Blavatsky''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gomes |first=Michael |title=Beatrice Hastings and the Defence of Madame Blavatsky |url=http://www.theosophycanada.com/files/hastings-solovyoff-fraud.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2017 |url-status= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228170602/http://www.theosophycanada.com/files/hastings-solovyoff-fraud.pdf |archivedate=28 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHer writings on Theosophy have been criticized by [[Skepticism|skeptics]].

Local resident Nick Sparling is credited as being Adair County's first aviator, in 1909. In 1924, Roy B. \"Cap\" Dodson started the first airport in the area, located on the north edge of Kirksville. However, an airfield at the present location of Kirksville Regional Airport wasn't created until 1930 when the Federal Aviation Administration built a series of emergency landing strips across the nation. With America's entry into [[World War II]], the '''Kirksville Municipal Airport''', as it had been declared in the late 1930s, received a major upgrade from the Civilian Pilots Training Program and the US Army Air Corps War Training Service. In 1942 a paved all-weather landing strip, hangars, a control tower and small restaurant were built; the paved runway was 3870&nbsp;ft until 1968.\n\nThe post-war boom in commercial aviation reached Kirksville in 1960 when [[Ozark Air Lines]] began scheduled flights. The plane was a familiar sight to many World War II veterans, as Ozark used the Douglas DC-3, the civil counterpart of the famed C-47 'Gooney Bird', now in Ozark's white and evergreen instead of Army Air Corps colors. The Ozark route began in Kansas City to Chicago with stops in Kirksville, [[Ottumwa, Iowa|Ottumwa]] and [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], [[Moline, Illinois]]. Airport improvements came after a bond issue was approved by Kirksville voters in 1967. A new six-thousand foot concrete runway was built, as well as a new terminal building and improved hangar facilities. The longer runway was needed for the faster Fairchild prop-jet that began flights to Kirksville in late 1968. Also in the 1960s, Ozark switched Kirksville service from a Kansas City-Chicago route to a Des Moines-to-St. Louis one. With the airport improvements came a new name, '''Clarence Cannon Memorial Airport'''\u2014chosen to honor long-time US Congressman Clarence Cannon of Missouri who had done much to help secure air service and funding for the airport.\n\nDespite nearly a million dollars in facility upgrades and a steady flow of passengers in and out of Kirksville, Ozark Airlines found the route to be financially untenable by the mid-1970s, with their final departure coming on April 23, 1976. Fortunately a local pilot and dentist, Dr. Stephen Barber, has established a small commuter air service, [[Horizon Airways]], in 1972. Horizon was able to help fill the void left by Ozarks departure, eventually expanding to five aircraft and service to both Kansas City and St. Louis.<ref>''A History Of Adair County Missouri'' published by the Kirksville-Adair County Bicentennial Committee, 1976.</ref><ref>'Flying High!' by Tony Frost & Corey Pritchard, published in ''The Chariton Collector'' magazine Spring, 1987.</ref>\n\n[[Air Choice One]] began scheduled flight operations twice daily, to and from [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]] during July 2009.

Local resident Nick Sparling is credited as being Adair County's first aviator, in 1909. In 1924, Roy B. \"Cap\" Dodson started the first airport in the area, located on the north edge of Kirksville. However, an airfield at the present location of Kirksville Regional Airport wasn't created until 1930 when the Federal Aviation Administration built a series of emergency landing strips across the nation. With America's entry into [[World War II]], the '''Kirksville Municipal Airport''', as it had been declared in the late 1930s, received a major upgrade from the Civilian Pilots Training Program and the US Army Air Corps War Training Service. In 1942 a paved all-weather landing strip, hangars, a control tower and small restaurant were built; the paved runway was 3870&nbsp;ft until 1968.\n\nThe post-war boom in commercial aviation reached Kirksville in 1960 when [[Ozark Air Lines]] began scheduled flights. The plane was a familiar sight to many World War II veterans, as Ozark used the Douglas DC-3, the civil counterpart of the famed C-47 'Gooney Bird', now in Ozark's white and evergreen instead of Army Air Corps colors. The Ozark route began in Kansas City to Chicago with stops in Kirksville, [[Ottumwa]] and [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], [[Moline, Illinois]]. Airport improvements came after a bond issue was approved by Kirksville voters in 1967. A new six-thousand foot concrete runway was built, as well as a new terminal building and improved hangar facilities. The longer runway was needed for the faster Fairchild prop-jet that began flights to Kirksville in late 1968. Also in the 1960s, Ozark switched Kirksville service from a Kansas City-Chicago route to a Des Moines-to-St. Louis one. With the airport improvements came a new name, '''Clarence Cannon Memorial Airport'''\u2014chosen to honor long-time US Congressman Clarence Cannon of Missouri who had done much to help secure air service and funding for the airport.\n\nDespite nearly a million dollars in facility upgrades and a steady flow of passengers in and out of Kirksville, Ozark Airlines found the route to be financially untenable by the mid-1970s, with their final departure coming on April 23, 1976. Fortunately a local pilot and dentist, Dr. Stephen Barber, has established a small commuter air service, [[Horizon Airways]], in 1972. Horizon was able to help fill the void left by Ozarks departure, eventually expanding to five aircraft and service to both Kansas City and St. Louis.<ref>''A History Of Adair County Missouri'' published by the Kirksville-Adair County Bicentennial Committee, 1976.</ref><ref>'Flying High!' by Tony Frost & Corey Pritchard, published in ''The Chariton Collector'' magazine Spring, 1987.</ref>\n\n[[Air Choice One]] began scheduled flight operations twice daily, to and from [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]] during July 2009.  Scheduled operations are currently subsidized by the Essential Air Service Act.
