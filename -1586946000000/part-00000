The rocks exposed vary systematically across Arabia, with the oldest rocks exposed in the [[Arabian-Nubian Shield]] near the Red Sea, overlain by earlier sediments that become younger towards the Persian Gulf.

Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\n\nAccording to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\">{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}</ref> Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\" />\n\nA plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula.

The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}\nDuring the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.\n* [[Arabia Deserta]] (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).\n* [[Arabia Felix]] (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.\n\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.<ref>See [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yENB_dXAtwC&pg=PA163 ''Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt''], David Frankfurter, BRILL, 1998, {{ISBN|90-04-11127-1}}, page 163</ref>\n\nThe Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' \u2013 Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4vOJ15vTZV4C&lpg=PA60&pg=PA60|title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |first=Kamal Suleiman |last=Salibi |publisher=University of California Press |date=1988 |isbn=978-0-520-07196-4 |pages=60\u201361 }}</ref> The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the region starting from [[Cilicia]], where the Euphrates river makes its descent into [[Syria]], through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.<ref>See for example Palestine: The Reality, [[Joseph Mary Nagle Jeffries]], Published by Longmans, Green and co., 1939, [https://archive.org/details/PalestineTheReality/page/n4/mode/1up Page 11]</ref>\n\n''The provinces of Arabia were:'' Al Tih, the Sinai peninsula, Hedjaz, Asir, Yemen, Hadramaut, Mahra and Shilu, Oman, Hasa, Bahrain, Dahna, Nufud, the Hammad, which included the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia.<ref>see Review of Reviews and World's Work: An International Magazine, Albert Shaw ed., The Review of Reviews Corporation, 1919, page 408]</ref><ref name=nie>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GRUoAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA795&pg=PA795|title=New International Encyclopedia \u2013 2nd Edition, Dodd, Mead, Co., 1914 |page= 795|work=google.com|year=1914 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:HistoricCoins.jpg|thumb|Ancient coins from [[Failaka Island]], [[Kuwait]]]]\nThe history of the Arabian Peninsula goes back to the beginnings of human habitation in Arabia up to 130,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uerpmann|first=Hans-Peter|last2=Usik|first2=Vitaly I.|last3=Parker|first3=Adrian G.|last4=Marks|first4=Anthony E.|last5=Jasim|first5=Sabah A.|last6=Armitage|first6=Simon J.|date=2011-01-28|title=The Southern Route \"Out of Africa\": Evidence for an Early Expansion of Modern Humans into Arabia|journal=Science|language=en|volume=331|issue=6016|pages=453\u2013456|doi=10.1126/science.1199113|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21273486}}</ref> However, a [[Homo sapiens]] fossilized finger bone was found at [[Al Wusta (Saudi Arabia)|Al Wusta]] in the [[Nefud Desert]], which indicates that the first human migration out of Africa to Arabia might date back to approximately 90,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-04/mpif-fhm040418.php|title=First human migration out of Africa more geographically widespread than previously thought|work=Eurek Alert|date=9 April 2018}}</ref> Nevertheless, the stone tools from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] age along with fossils of other animals discovered at Ti's al Ghadah, in northwestern Saudi Arabia, might imply that hominids migrated through a \"Green Arabia\" between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Roberts | first1=Patrick | last2=Stewart | first2=Mathew | last3=Alagaili | first3=Abdulaziz N. | last4=Breeze | first4=Paul | last5=Candy | first5=Ian | last6=Drake | first6=Nick | last7=Groucutt | first7=Huw S. | last8=Scerri | first8=Eleanor M.

The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\".<ref>See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Hourani (2003), p.22\n* Lapidus (2002), p.32\n* Madelung (1996), p.43\n* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref>\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India. The political focus of the Muslim world then shifted to the newly conquered territories.<ref>See: Holt (1977a), p.57, Hourani (2003), p.22, Lapidus (2002), p.32, Madelung (1996), p.43, Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref><ref name=\"L.

Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the [[Hejaz]]. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the [[Hejaz]], they were usually subject to the [[suzerainty]] of one of the major Islamic empires of the time. In the Middle Ages, these included the [[Abbasids]] of [[Baghdad]], and the [[Fatimids]], [[Ayyubids]] and [[Mamluks]] of Egypt.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online: History of Arabia\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31568/history-of-Arabia Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online: History of Arabia] retrieved 18 January 2011</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Ottoman territories acquired between 1481 and 1683 ([[List of Ottoman Empire dominated territories|See: list of territories]])]]\n\nThe provincial Ottoman Army for Arabia (Arabistan Ordusu) was headquartered in [[Syria (region)|Syria]], which included Palestine, the Transjordan region in addition to Lebanon ([[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate|Mount Lebanon was, however, a semi-autonomous mutasarrifate]]).

Arabs living in one of the existing districts of the Arabian peninsula, the Emirate of [[Hejaz]], asked for a British guarantee of independence. Their proposal included all Arab lands south of a line roughly corresponding to the northern frontiers of present-day Syria and Iraq.

Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\n\nThe [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]]).\n\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.<ref>King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18</ref>\n\n====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\n\nThese events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n====Oil reserves====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].\n\n====Civil war in Yemen====\nThe [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.\n\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\n\nBy 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed. Egyptian military historians refer to the war in Yemen as their [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref name=enein>{{Cite news |issue=Jan\u2013Feb, 2004 |last=Aboul-Enein |first=Youssef |title=The Egyptian-Yemen War: Egyptian perspectives on Guerrilla warfare |work=Infantry Magazine |access-date=October 3, 2008 |date=2004-01-01 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203161830/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-02-03}}</ref>\n\n====Gulf War====\nIn 1990, [[Iraq]] invaded Kuwait.<ref>see Richard Schofield, Kuwait and Iraq: Historical Claims and Territorial.

Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\n\nAccording to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\">{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}</ref> Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\" />\n\nA plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula.

The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}\nDuring the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.\n* [[Arabia Deserta]] (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).\n* [[Arabia Felix]] (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.\n\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.<ref>See [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yENB_dXAtwC&pg=PA163 ''Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt''], David Frankfurter, BRILL, 1998, {{ISBN|90-04-11127-1}}, page 163</ref>\n\nThe Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' \u2013 Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4vOJ15vTZV4C&lpg=PA60&pg=PA60|title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |first=Kamal Suleiman |last=Salibi |publisher=University of California Press |date=1988 |isbn=978-0-520-07196-4 |pages=60\u201361 }}</ref> The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the region starting from [[Cilicia]], where the Euphrates river makes its descent into [[Syria]], through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.<ref>See for example Palestine: The Reality, [[Joseph Mary Nagle Jeffries]], Published by Longmans, Green and co., 1939, [https://archive.org/details/PalestineTheReality/page/n4/mode/1up Page 11]</ref>\n\n''The provinces of Arabia were:'' Al Tih, the Sinai peninsula, Hedjaz, Asir, Yemen, Hadramaut, Mahra and Shilu, Oman, Hasa, Bahrain, Dahna, Nufud, the Hammad, which included the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia.<ref>see Review of Reviews and World's Work: An International Magazine, Albert Shaw ed., The Review of Reviews Corporation, 1919, page 408]</ref><ref name=nie>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GRUoAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA795&pg=PA795|title=New International Encyclopedia \u2013 2nd Edition, Dodd, Mead, Co., 1914 |page= 795|work=google.com|year=1914 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:HistoricCoins.jpg|thumb|Ancient coins from [[Failaka Island]], [[Kuwait]]]]\nThe history of the Arabian Peninsula goes back to the beginnings of human habitation in Arabia up to 130,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uerpmann|first=Hans-Peter|last2=Usik|first2=Vitaly I.|last3=Parker|first3=Adrian G.|last4=Marks|first4=Anthony E.|last5=Jasim|first5=Sabah A.|last6=Armitage|first6=Simon J.|date=2011-01-28|title=The Southern Route \"Out of Africa\": Evidence for an Early Expansion of Modern Humans into Arabia|journal=Science|language=en|volume=331|issue=6016|pages=453\u2013456|doi=10.1126/science.1199113|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21273486}}</ref> However, a [[Homo sapiens]] fossilized finger bone was found at [[Al Wusta (Saudi Arabia)|Al Wusta]] in the [[Nefud Desert]], which indicates that the first human migration out of Africa to Arabia might date back to approximately 90,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-04/mpif-fhm040418.php|title=First human migration out of Africa more geographically widespread than previously thought|work=Eurek Alert|date=9 April 2018}}</ref> Nevertheless, the stone tools from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] age along with fossils of other animals discovered at Ti's al Ghadah, in northwestern Saudi Arabia, might imply that hominids migrated through a \"Green Arabia\" between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Roberts | first1=Patrick | last2=Stewart | first2=Mathew | last3=Alagaili | first3=Abdulaziz N. | last4=Breeze | first4=Paul | last5=Candy | first5=Ian | last6=Drake | first6=Nick | last7=Groucutt | first7=Huw S. | last8=Scerri | first8=Eleanor M.

The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\".<ref>See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Hourani (2003), p.22\n* Lapidus (2002), p.32\n* Madelung (1996), p.43\n* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref>\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India.

Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the [[Hejaz]]. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the [[Hejaz]], they were usually subject to the [[suzerainty]] of one of the major Islamic empires of the time.

Arabs living in one of the existing districts of the Arabian peninsula, the Emirate of [[Hejaz]], asked for a British guarantee of independence. Their proposal included all Arab lands south of a line roughly corresponding to the northern frontiers of present-day Syria and Iraq. They envisioned a new Arab state, or confederation of states, adjoining the southern Arabian Peninsula.

Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\n\nThe [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]]).\n\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.<ref>King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18</ref>\n\n====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\n\nThese events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n====Oil reserves====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].\n\n====Civil war in Yemen====\nThe [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.\n\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\n\nBy 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed. Egyptian military historians refer to the war in Yemen as their [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref name=enein>{{Cite news |issue=Jan\u2013Feb, 2004 |last=Aboul-Enein |first=Youssef |title=The Egyptian-Yemen War: Egyptian perspectives on Guerrilla warfare |work=Infantry Magazine |access-date=October 3, 2008 |date=2004-01-01 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203161830/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-02-03}}</ref>\n\n====Gulf War====\nIn 1990, [[Iraq]] invaded Kuwait.<ref>see Richard Schofield, Kuwait and Iraq: Historical Claims and Territorial.

Von Tilzer's claim was dismissed.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k_rgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA633&lpg=PA633&dq=%22jimmy+lucas%22+lyrics&source=bl&ots=VeIj7s9aq-&sig=ACfU3U2IL7DsdLuuQKX8RSx4TA2pWmP7cg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwizt7mAl-roAhVJXsAKHQvdCU4Q6AEwA3oECAsQLw#v=onepage&q=%22jimmy%20lucas%22%20lyrics&f=false  Von Tilzer et al. v Jerry Vogel Music Co.

It was vehemently denounced by prominent [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Billy Sunday]].  The phrase \"Oh! You Kid!\" became ubiquitous.<ref name=bruenger>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M7swDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=edgar+selden+%22oh+you+kid%22&source=bl&ots=2a9VyFVCw8&sig=ACfU3U27mt99qa1PlF5kDQEXCXJtgRFfPg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj1xP_A2eXoAhWXO8AKHRKGCEAQ6AEwDXoECAsQKQ#v=onepage&q=edgar%20selden%20%22oh%20you%20kid%22&f=false    David Bruenger, ''Making Money, Making Music: History and Core Concepts'', University of California Press, 2016, pp.46-48]</ref>  It was described in one newspaper as \"meaningless jargon... utterly bereft of any glimmer of common sense that would appeal to the intelligence lurking in the noodle of a new-born doodle-bug\", but became popular on \"one-reel motion pictures, studio photographs, neckties, pinback buttons, lapel pins, porcelain figurines, souvenir dishware, and hundreds of picture postcards, which savored the song\u2019s naughtiness and found fodder for lame jokes, silly wordplay, and racial and ethnic caricatures.\"<ref name=slate/>  \n\nIt also led to legal action.  A farmer in [[Missouri]] who sent a woman a postcard saying \"I Love My Wife, But Oh You Kid!\" was given a fine for sending improper matter through the mail.  A judge in [[Los Angeles]] ruled that anyone using the salutation \"Oh, you kid!\" in public should be imprisoned on a charge of disturbing the peace, and a magistrate in [[Pittsburgh]] said that anyone using the phrase in public should be whipped.  In [[Atlanta]], a man was shot by a woman's husband for crying \"Oh, you kid!\" towards her; the gunman was released without charge.<ref name=slate/>\n\nRosen commented that \"the reaction of the social reformers and guardians of public morality to the song... show us the same kinds of moral panics that greeted... later forms of popular music.\"<ref name=npr/>\n\nThe craze died down by 1910, though the phrase continued in popular usage, being particularly favored by [[Groucho Marx]] in comedy routines and as a [[tagline]].   The 1946 musical ''[[The Harvey Girls]]'' included a new song, \"Oh, You Kid\", written by [[Harry Warren]] and [[Johnny Mercer]] and performed by [[Angela Lansbury]].<ref name=slate/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1909 songs]]\n[[Category:Catchphrases]]\n", "name_user": "Ghmyrtle", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eScandal and subsequent use", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_You_Kid!"}

He is currently the senior assistant coach at [[A-League]] side [[Western Melbourne FC|Western United]].\n\n==Club career==\nAnastasiadis began his career at [[Heidelberg United]] before being signed by the Greek club [[PAOK FC|PAOK Thessaloniki FC]] at the age of 19. He made his debut in 1988 and became an influential part of the team, playing in 18 [[Super League Greece|Alpha Ethniki]] matches, 5 cup games and 24 friendlies in the 1988/89 season, scoring 12 goals in total. He also took part in the club's brief 1990/91 and 1991/92 [[UEFA Cup]] campaigns. Anastasiadis played a total of 382 (203 league, 52 cup) matches and scored 66 (24 league, 3 cup) goals in his nine years at the club as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]].\n\nAnastasiadis left PAOK in 1997 to return to Australia, where he joined [[National Soccer League|NSL]] side [[South Melbourne FC]]. He played a key attacking role which helped the club to win back-to-back championships in the 1997/98 and 1998/99 seasons, scoring goals in both grand final victories: once in the 1997/98 final, past his brother [[Dean Anastasiadis]] who was in goal for [[Carlton S.C.|Carlton]]; and two goals in the 1998/99 Grand Final against [[Sydney United]] as a substitute. He also represented the club at the [[2000 FIFA Club World Championship]], scoring the team's only goal (and Australia's first in the tournament) of the competition against [[Mexico|Mexican]] side [[Necaxa]]. He played his last professional game in the 2000/01 NSL grand final against the [[Wollongong Wolves]], coming off the bench to score a goal, once again past his brother [[Dean Anastasiadis|Dean]] who was in goal for the opposition. He finished his playing career fully in 2003 playing in the lower Victorian leagues with Yarraville Glory, as captain-coach.\n\nJohn Anastasiadis is an Honorary Life Member of [http://www.paok.com.au/ Melbourne Club PAOK], The official PAOK Thessaloniki Supporters Club of Australia.\n\n==Managerial career==\nAfter retirement from playing, and with Yarraville relegated under his stewardship in 2003, he managed to get the side promoted back the next season.\n\nIn 2005, with the return of South Melbourne to the [[Victorian Premier League]] after the disbandment of the NSL competition, Anastasiadis put his hand up for the job which few wanted. Despite taking charge of a young squad which was quickly assembled merely weeks before the start of the new season, and which was labelled as a relegation candidate at the start of the year, Anastasiadis led the side to 3rd place on the ladder at the end of the season and as far as the Preliminary Final, where the team lost 1-0 to [[Heidelberg United]] and was knocked out. It was an incredible achievement for Anastasiadis considering just three players turned up to his first training session at the club, one of which was his brother Dean.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cornerflag.com.au/my-football-journey-john-anastasiadis/2/|title=My Football Journey: John Anastasiadis \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 The Corner Flag|website=www.cornerflag.com.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-24}}</ref> Retained as coach for the 2006 season, he led South Melbourne to victory in the Grand Final of the [[Victorian Premier League|Vodafone Cup]] competition. After failing to make the finals in 2007, South's poor start in 2008 saw Anastasiadis resign.\n\nAfter three years at South, John moved to the Oakleigh Cannons where he would spend the next three seasons. Despite mixed results, players such as [[Ivan Franjic]]. [[Cameron Watson (footballer)|Cameron Watson]] and [[Nick Kalmar]] all came to prominence and earned A-League contracts.<ref name=\":0\" /> Anastasiadis departed Oakleigh in 2010.\n\nHalf way through the 2011 season, Anastasiadis accepted a call from [[Bentleigh Greens]] to become the senior head coach. Since the move to Bentleigh, John has seen his team reach the VPL grand final in 2013, the semi-final of the inaugural [[FFA Cup]] in 2014 and win the club's first ever major title when Bentleigh beat [[South Melbourne FC]] at Lakeside Stadium in the [[National Premier Leagues Victoria]] Grand Final.

He played a key attacking role which helped the club to win back-to-back championships in the 1997/98 and 1998/99 seasons, scoring goals in both grand final victories: once in the 1997/98 final, past his brother [[Dean Anastasiadis]] who was in goal for [[Carlton S.C.|Carlton]]; and two goals in the 1998/99 Grand Final against [[Sydney United]] as a substitute. He also represented the club at the [[2000 FIFA Club World Championship]], scoring the team's only goal (and Australia's first in the tournament) of the competition against [[Mexico|Mexican]] side [[Necaxa]]. He played his last professional game in the 2000/01 NSL grand final against the [[Wollongong Wolves]], coming off the bench to score a goal, once again past his brother [[Dean Anastasiadis|Dean]] who was in goal for the opposition. He finished his playing career fully in 2003 playing in the lower Victorian leagues with Yarraville Glory, as captain-coach.\n\nJohn Anastasiadis is an Honorary Life Member of [http://www.paok.com.au/ Melbourne Club PAOK], The official PAOK Thessaloniki Supporters Club of Australia.\n\n==Managerial career==\nAfter retirement from playing, and with Yarraville relegated under his stewardship in 2003, he managed to get the side promoted back the next season.\n\nIn 2005, with the return of South Melbourne to the [[Victorian Premier League]] after the disbandment of the NSL competition, Anastasiadis put his hand up for the job which few wanted. Despite taking charge of a young squad which was quickly assembled merely weeks before the start of the new season, and which was labelled as a relegation candidate at the start of the year, Anastasiadis led the side to 3rd place on the ladder at the end of the season and as far as the Preliminary Final, where the team lost 1-0 to [[Heidelberg United]] and was knocked out. It was an incredible achievement for Anastasiadis considering just three players turned up to his first training session at the club, one of which was his brother Dean.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cornerflag.com.au/my-football-journey-john-anastasiadis/2/|title=My Football Journey: John Anastasiadis \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 The Corner Flag|website=www.cornerflag.com.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-24}}</ref> Retained as coach for the 2006 season, he led South Melbourne to victory in the Grand Final of the [[Victorian Premier League|Vodafone Cup]] competition.

During the [[War of 1812]], they held a council in Milwaukee in June 1812, which resulted in their decision to attack [[Chicago]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Keating|first=Ann|title=Rising Up from Indian Country|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}</ref> in retaliation against American expansion. This resulted in the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] on August 15, 1812, the only known armed conflict in the Chicago area. This battle convinced the American government that the Native Americans had to be removed from their land. After being attacked in the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832, the Native Americans in Milwaukee signed the [[Treaty of Chicago#1833 Treaty of Chicago|Treaty of Chicago]] with the United States in 1833.

French missionaries and traders first passed through the area in the late 17th and 18th centuries.

Walker]]. Solomon Juneau was the first of the three to come to the area, in 1818. He founded a town called Juneau's Side, or Juneautown, that began attracting more settlers. In competition with Juneau, Byron Kilbourn established Kilbourntown west of the [[Milwaukee River]]. He ensured the roads running toward the river did not join with those on the east side. This accounts for the large number of angled bridges that still exist in Milwaukee today.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/bridges/|title=Bridges {{!}} Encyclopedia of Milwaukee|website=emke.uwm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref> Further, Kilbourn distributed maps of the area which only showed Kilbourntown, implying Juneautown did not exist or the river's east side was uninhabited and thus undesirable. The third prominent developer was George H. Walker. He claimed land to the south of the Milwaukee River, along with Juneautown, where he built a log house in 1834. This area grew and became known as Walker's Point.\n\nThe first large wave of settlement to the areas that would later become Milwaukee County and the City of Milwaukee began in 1835, following removal of the tribes in the Council of Three Fires. Early that year it became known that Juneau and Kilbourn intended to lay out competing town-sites. By the year's end both had purchased their lands from the government and made their first sales. There were perhaps 100 new settlers in this year, mostly from New England and other Eastern states. On September 17, 1835, the first election was held in Milwaukee; the number of votes cast was 39.<ref>{{Citation-attribution|{{Cite book|title = Memoirs of Milwaukee County from the Earliest Historical Times ..., Vol. I|last = Watrous|first = Jerome A.|publisher = Western Historical Association|year = 1909|url = https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:Jqsw4p18KfAC&id=XD4VAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false|location = Madison, Wisconsin|pages = 265\u2013267}}}}</ref>\n\nBy 1840, the three towns had grown, along with their rivalries. There were intense battles between the towns, mainly Juneautown and Kilbourntown, which culminated with the [[Milwaukee Bridge War]] of 1845. Following the Bridge War, town leaders decided the best course of action was to officially unite the towns. So, on January 31, 1846, they combined to incorporate as the City of Milwaukee and elected Solomon Juneau as Milwaukee's first mayor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf |title=City of Milwaukee Incorporated, page 164, 1846; page 314, 1851 |accessdate=April 8, 2007 |author=City of Milwaukee |publisher=Office of the Secretary of State of Wisconsin|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070605144656/http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 5, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Milwaukee birdseye map by Bailey (1872). loc call no g4124m-pm010450.jpg|thumb|Illustrated map of Milwaukee in 1872]]\n\nMilwaukee began to grow as a city as high numbers of immigrants, mainly [[Germans|German]], made their way to Wisconsin during the 1840s and 1850s. Scholars classify [[German immigration to the United States]] in three major waves, and Wisconsin received a significant number of immigrants from all three. The first wave from 1845 to 1855 consisted mainly of people from [[Southwestern Germany]], the second wave from 1865 to 1873 concerned primarily [[Northwestern Germany]], while the third wave from 1880 to 1893 came from [[Northeastern Germany]].<ref name=\"Bungert, Heike 2006\">Bungert, Heike, Cora Lee Kluge and Robert C.

In 1890, the 2.78 million first-generation German Americans represented the second-largest foreign-born group in the United States. Of all those who left the German lands between 1835 and 1910, 90 percent went to the United States, most of them traveling to the Mid-Atlantic states and the Midwest.<ref name=\"Bungert, Heike 2006\" />\n\nBy 1900 34 percent of Milwaukee's population was of German background.<ref name=\"Bungert, Heike 2006\" /> The largest number of German immigrants to Milwaukee came from [[Prussia]], followed by [[Bavaria]], [[Saxony]], [[Hanover]], and [[Hesse-Darmstadt]]. Milwaukee gained its reputation as the most German of American cities not just from the large number of German immigrants it received, but for the sense of community which the immigrants established here.<ref name=\"Conzen, Kathleen Neils 1860\">Conzen, Kathleen Neils.

The pattern of German immigrants to settle near each other encouraged the continuation of German lifestyle and customs. This resulted in [[German language]] organizations that encompassed all aspects of life; for example, singing societies and gymnastics clubs. Germans also had a lasting influence on the American school system. [[Kindergarten]] was created as a pre-school for children, and sports programs of all levels, as well as music and art were incorporated as elements of the regular school curriculum. These ideas were first introduced by radical-democratic German groups, such as the Socialist Turner Societies, known today as the [[American Turners]]. Specifically in Milwaukee, the American [[Turners]] established its own [[Normal College]] for teachers of physical education and a German-English Academy.<ref>Rippley, LaVern J. and Eberhard Reichmann, trans. \"The German Americans, An Ethnic Experience.\" [http://maxkade.iupui.edu/ Max Kade German-American Center] and [[Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis]].

Foremost among these were [[Polish people|Polish]] immigrants. The Poles had many reasons for leaving their homeland, mainly poverty and political oppression. Because Milwaukee offered the Polish immigrants an abundance of low-paying entry level jobs, it became one of the largest [[Polish settlements in the USA]].\n\n[[File:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Wisconsin Street, Milwaukee, 1900.jpg|thumb|Wisconsin Street with [[Pabst Building]], Milwaukee, 1900]]\n\nFor many residents, [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Milwaukee's South Side|Milwaukee's South Side]] is synonymous with the [[Milwaukee#Polish immigrants|Polish community]] that developed here. The group maintained a high profile here for decades, and it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that families began to disperse to the southern suburbs.\n\nBy 1850, there were seventy-five Poles in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] and the [[US Census]] shows they had a variety of occupations: grocers, blacksmiths, tavernkeepers, coopers, butchers, broommakers, shoemakers, draymen, laborers, and farmers. Three distinct Polish communities evolved in Milwaukee, with the majority settling in the area south of Greenfield Avenue. Milwaukee County's Polish population of 30,000 in 1890 rose to 100,000 by 1915. Poles historically have had a strong national cultural and social identity, maintained through the Catholic Church. A view of Milwaukee's South Side skyline is replete with the steeples of the many churches these immigrants built that are still vital centers of the community.\n\n[[St. Stanislaus Catholic Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|St. Stanislaus Catholic Church]] and the surrounding [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] was the center of [[Polish people|Polish]] life in Milwaukee. As the Polish community surrounding St. Stanislaus continued to grow, Mitchell Street became known as the \"Polish Grand Avenue\". As Mitchell Street grew more dense, the Polish population started moving south to the [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Lincoln Village neighborhood]], home to the [[Basilica of St. Josaphat]] and [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin#Kosciuszko Park|Kosciuszko Park]].

This numbering system is also used to the north by [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]] in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]], and by some [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]] communities.\n\nMilwaukee is crossed by [[Interstate 43]] and [[Interstate 94]], which come together downtown at the [[Marquette Interchange]]. The [[Interstate 894]] bypass (which as of May 2015 also contains [[Interstate 41]]) runs through portions of the city's southwest side, and [[Interstate 794]] comes out of the Marquette interchange eastbound, bends south along the lakefront and crosses the harbor over the [[Hoan Bridge]], then ends near the [[Bay View, Milwaukee|Bay View]] [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] and becomes the \"Lake Parkway\" ([[Wisconsin Highway 794|WIS-794]]).\n\nOne of the distinctive traits of Milwaukee's residential areas are the neighborhoods full of so-called [[Polish flat]]s. These are two-[[family]] [[home]]s with separate entrances, but with the units stacked one on top of another instead of side-by-side. This arrangement enables a family of limited means to purchase both a home and a modestly priced [[rental]] [[apartment]] unit. Since [[Polish-American]] immigrants to the area prized land ownership, this solution, which was prominent in their areas of settlement within the city, came to be associated with them.\n\nThe tallest building in the city is the [[U.S. Bank Center (Milwaukee)|U.S. Bank Center]].\n\n===Climate===\nMilwaukee's location in the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes Region]] often has rapidly changing weather, producing a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfa''), with cold, windy, snowy winters, and warm, humid summers.

The lake breeze is most common between the months of March and July. This onshore flow causes cooler temperatures to move inland usually {{convert|5|to|15|mi|0}}, with much warmer conditions persisting further inland. Because Milwaukee's official climate site, [[Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport]], is only {{convert|3|mi}} from the lake, seasonal temperature variations are less extreme than in many other locations of the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]].\n\nAs the sun sets, the convection current reverses and an offshore flow ensues causing a land breeze. After a land breeze develops, warmer temperatures flow east toward the lakeshore, sometimes causing high temperatures during the late evening. The lake breeze is not a daily occurrence and will not usually form if a southwest, west, or northwest wind generally exceeds {{convert|15|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The lake moderates cold air outbreaks along the lakeshore during winter months.\n\nAside from the lake's influence, overnight lows in downtown Milwaukee year-round are often much warmer than suburban locations because of the [[urban heat island effect]]. Onshore winds elevate daytime [[relative humidity]] levels in Milwaukee as compared to inland locations nearby.\n\nThunderstorms in the region can be dangerous and damaging, bringing [[hail]] and high winds. In rare instances, they can bring a [[tornado]]. However, almost all summer rainfall in the city is brought by these storms.

Many of the new [[immigrants]] who were pouring into the new state of Wisconsin during the middle of the 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked [[wheat]]-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. [[Rail transport|Railroads]] were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's [[harbor]]. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.\n\nThere was intense competition for markets with Chicago, and to a lesser degree, with [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]]. Eventually Chicago won out due to its superior financial and transposition status, as well as being a hub on major railroad lines throughout the United States. Milwaukee did solidify its place as the commercial capital of Wisconsin and an important market in the Midwest.<ref name=\"milwaukeehistory.net\" />\n\n[[File:Menomonee Valley.jpg|thumb|[[Rail tracks]] along the industrial [[Menomonee Valley]], ancestral home of the [[Menominee]] Indians]]\nBecause of its easy access to Lake Michigan and other waterways, Milwaukee's [[Menomonee Valley]] has historically been home to [[manufacturing]], [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], [[Rendering (food processing)|rendering plants]], [[shipping]], and other [[heavy industry]].\n\nReshaping of the valley began with the [[rail transport|railroads]] built by city co-founder [[Byron Kilbourn]] to bring product from Wisconsin's farm interior to the port. By 1862 Milwaukee was the largest shipper of [[wheat]] on the planet, and related industry developed. [[Grain elevator]]s were built and, due to Milwaukee's dominant [[German American|German immigrant population]], [[Brewery|breweries]] sprang up around the processing of [[barley]] and [[hops]]. A number of [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] were constructed, of which the [[Pfister & Vogel]] tannery grew to become the largest in America.\n\nIn 1843 George Burnham and his brother Jonathan opened a [[brickyard]] near 16th Street. When a durable and distinct cream-colored brick came out of the clay beds, other brickyards sprang up to take advantage of this resource. Because many of the city's buildings were built using this material it earned the nickname \"Cream City\", and consequently the brick was called [[Cream City brick]]. By 1881 the Burnham brickyard, which employed 200 men and peaked at 15 million bricks a year, was the largest in the world.\n\n[[Gristmill|Flour mills]], packing plants, breweries, railways and tanneries further industrialized the valley. With the [[marsh]]lands drained and the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic]] and [[Milwaukee River]]s dredged, attention turned to the valley.\n\nAlong with the processing industries, bulk commodity storage and machining and manufacturing entered the scene. The valley was home to the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]], [[Falk Corporation]], [[Cutler-Hammer]], [[Harnischfeger Corporation]], [[Chain Belt Company]], [[Nordberg Manufacturing Company]] and other industry giants.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Milwaukee was home to several pioneer [[brass era]] [[automobile]] makers, including Ogren (1919\u20131922).<ref>{{cite book |last=Clymer |first=Floyd |title=Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925 |location=New York |publisher=Bonanza Books |year=1950 |page=153 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n===Brewing===\n{{further|Beer in Milwaukee}}\n\nMilwaukee became synonymous with [[Germans]] and [[beer]] beginning in the 1840s. The Germans had long enjoyed beer and set up breweries when they arrived in Milwaukee. By 1856, there were more than two dozen breweries in Milwaukee, most of them owned and operated by Germans. Besides making beer for the rest of the nation, Milwaukeeans enjoyed consuming the various beers produced in the city's breweries. As early as 1843, pioneer historian [[James Buck]] recorded 138 taverns in Milwaukee, an average of one per forty residents.

During the [[French and Indian War]], a group of \"Ojibwas and Pottawattamies from the far [Lake] Michigan\" (i.e., the area from Milwaukee to Green Bay) joined the French-Canadian [[Daniel Li\u00e9nard de Beaujeu]] at the [[Battle of the Monongahela]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=William|title=Empires at War|year=2005|publisher=Walker & Company |location=New York|page=68|isbn=9780802719355|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqukoiTFL_oC&pg=PA68}}</ref> In the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Native Americans around Milwaukee were some of the few groups to ally with the rebel Continentals.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Richard|title=The Middle Ground|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=400|isbn=9781139495684|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHLfiOZVzmMC&pg=PA400&lpg=PA400#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, the Native Americans fought the United States in the [[Northwest Indian War]] as part of the [[Council of Three Fires]]. During the [[War of 1812]], they held a council in Milwaukee in June 1812, which resulted in their decision to attack [[Chicago]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Keating|first=Ann|title=Rising Up from Indian Country|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=137}}</ref> in retaliation against American expansion. This resulted in the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] on August 15, 1812, the only known armed conflict in the Chicago area. This battle convinced the American government that the Native Americans had to be removed from their land. After being attacked in the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832, the Native Americans in Milwaukee signed the [[Treaty of Chicago#1833 Treaty of Chicago|Treaty of Chicago]] with the United States in 1833. In exchange for their ceding their lands in the area, they were to receive monetary payments and lands west of the Mississippi in [[Indian Territory]].\n\n===Milwaukee since European settlement===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}<!--many paragraphs are missing citations-->\n[[File:Solomon Juneau.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Solomon Juneau]], who helped establish the city of Milwaukee]]\n\nEuropeans had arrived in the Milwaukee area prior to the 1833 Treaty of Chicago. French missionaries and traders first passed through the area in the late 17th and 18th centuries. Alexis Laframboise, in 1785, coming from Michilimackinac (now in Michigan) settled a trading post; and is considered the first resident of European descent in the Milwaukee region.<ref name=\"St-Pierre, T 1895\">St-Pierre, T.

Sillery, Qu\u00e9bec: Septentrion. 2000; 1895.</ref> Early explorers called the Milwaukee River and surrounding lands various names: Melleorki, Milwacky, Mahn-a-waukie, Milwarck, and Milwaucki, in efforts to transliterate the native terms. For many years, printed records gave the name as \"Milwaukie\".\n\nOne story on the origin of Milwaukee's name says,\n{{quote|[O]ne day during the thirties of the last century [1800s] a newspaper calmly changed the name to Milwaukee, and Milwaukee it has remained until this day.<ref name=\"WGBruce\">{{cite book|last= Bruce |first= William George |year= 1936 |title= A Short History of Milwaukee |location= Milwaukee, Wisconsin |publisher= The Bruce Publishing Company |pages= 15\u201316|lccn= 36010193 }}</ref>}}\nThe spelling \"Milwaukie\" lives on in [[Milwaukie]], [[Oregon]], named after the Wisconsin city in 1847, before the current spelling was universally accepted.\n\nMilwaukee has three \"[[founding fathers]]\": [[Solomon Juneau]], [[Byron Kilbourn]], and [[George H. Walker]]. Solomon Juneau was the first of the three to come to the area, in 1818. He founded a town called Juneau's Side, or Juneautown, that began attracting more settlers. In competition with Juneau, Byron Kilbourn established Kilbourntown west of the [[Milwaukee River]]. He ensured the roads running toward the river did not join with those on the east side. This accounts for the large number of angled bridges that still exist in Milwaukee today.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/bridges/|title=Bridges {{!}} Encyclopedia of Milwaukee|website=emke.uwm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref> Further, Kilbourn distributed maps of the area which only showed Kilbourntown, implying Juneautown did not exist or the river's east side was uninhabited and thus undesirable. The third prominent developer was George H. Walker. He claimed land to the south of the Milwaukee River, along with Juneautown, where he built a log house in 1834. This area grew and became known as Walker's Point.\n\nThe first large wave of settlement to the areas that would later become Milwaukee County and the City of Milwaukee began in 1835, following removal of the tribes in the Council of Three Fires. Early that year it became known that Juneau and Kilbourn intended to lay out competing town-sites. By the year's end both had purchased their lands from the government and made their first sales. There were perhaps 100 new settlers in this year, mostly from New England and other Eastern states. On September 17, 1835, the first election was held in Milwaukee; the number of votes cast was 39.<ref>{{Citation-attribution|{{Cite book|title = Memoirs of Milwaukee County from the Earliest Historical Times ..., Vol. I|last = Watrous|first = Jerome A.|publisher = Western Historical Association|year = 1909|url = https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:Jqsw4p18KfAC&id=XD4VAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false|location = Madison, Wisconsin|pages = 265\u2013267}}}}</ref>\n\nBy 1840, the three towns had grown, along with their rivalries. There were intense battles between the towns, mainly Juneautown and Kilbourntown, which culminated with the [[Milwaukee Bridge War]] of 1845. Following the Bridge War, town leaders decided the best course of action was to officially unite the towns.

The first wave from 1845 to 1855 consisted mainly of people from [[Southwestern Germany]], the second wave from 1865 to 1873 concerned primarily [[Northwestern Germany]], while the third wave from 1880 to 1893 came from [[Northeastern Germany]].<ref name=\"Bungert, Heike 2006\">Bungert, Heike, Cora Lee Kluge and Robert C.

In 1890, the 2.78 million first-generation German Americans represented the second-largest foreign-born group in the United States. Of all those who left the German lands between 1835 and 1910, 90 percent went to the United States, most of them traveling to the Mid-Atlantic states and the Midwest.<ref name=\"Bungert, Heike 2006\" />\n\nBy 1900 34 percent of Milwaukee's population was of German background.<ref name=\"Bungert, Heike 2006\" /> The largest number of German immigrants to Milwaukee came from [[Prussia]], followed by [[Bavaria]], [[Saxony]], [[Hanover]], and [[Hesse-Darmstadt]]. Milwaukee gained its reputation as the most German of American cities not just from the large number of German immigrants it received, but for the sense of community which the immigrants established here.<ref name=\"Conzen, Kathleen Neils 1860\">Conzen, Kathleen Neils.

The pattern of German immigrants to settle near each other encouraged the continuation of German lifestyle and customs. This resulted in [[German language]] organizations that encompassed all aspects of life; for example, singing societies and gymnastics clubs. Germans also had a lasting influence on the American school system. [[Kindergarten]] was created as a pre-school for children, and sports programs of all levels, as well as music and art were incorporated as elements of the regular school curriculum. These ideas were first introduced by radical-democratic German groups, such as the Socialist Turner Societies, known today as the [[American Turners]]. Specifically in Milwaukee, the American [[Turners]] established its own [[Normal College]] for teachers of physical education and a German-English Academy.<ref>Rippley, LaVern J. and Eberhard Reichmann, trans. \"The German Americans, An Ethnic Experience.\" [http://maxkade.iupui.edu/ Max Kade German-American Center] and [[Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis]].

Foremost among these were [[Polish people|Polish]] immigrants. The Poles had many reasons for leaving their homeland, mainly poverty and political oppression. Because Milwaukee offered the Polish immigrants an abundance of low-paying entry level jobs, it became one of the largest [[Polish settlements in the USA]].\n\n[[File:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Wisconsin Street, Milwaukee, 1900.jpg|thumb|Wisconsin Street with [[Pabst Building]], Milwaukee, 1900]]\n\nFor many residents, [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Milwaukee's South Side|Milwaukee's South Side]] is synonymous with the [[Milwaukee#Polish immigrants|Polish community]] that developed here. The group maintained a high profile here for decades, and it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that families began to disperse to the southern suburbs.\n\nBy 1850, there were seventy-five Poles in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] and the [[US Census]] shows they had a variety of occupations: grocers, blacksmiths, tavernkeepers, coopers, butchers, broommakers, shoemakers, draymen, laborers, and farmers. Three distinct Polish communities evolved in Milwaukee, with the majority settling in the area south of Greenfield Avenue. Milwaukee County's Polish population of 30,000 in 1890 rose to 100,000 by 1915. Poles historically have had a strong national cultural and social identity, maintained through the Catholic Church. A view of Milwaukee's South Side skyline is replete with the steeples of the many churches these immigrants built that are still vital centers of the community.\n\n[[St. Stanislaus Catholic Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|St. Stanislaus Catholic Church]] and the surrounding [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] was the center of [[Polish people|Polish]] life in Milwaukee. As the Polish community surrounding St. Stanislaus continued to grow, Mitchell Street became known as the \"Polish Grand Avenue\". As Mitchell Street grew more dense, the Polish population started moving south to the [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Lincoln Village neighborhood]], home to the [[Basilica of St. Josaphat]] and [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin#Kosciuszko Park|Kosciuszko Park]]. Other Polish communities started on the east side of Milwaukee.

This numbering system is also used to the north by [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]] in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]], and by some [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]] communities.\n\nMilwaukee is crossed by [[Interstate 43]] and [[Interstate 94]], which come together downtown at the [[Marquette Interchange]]. The [[Interstate 894]] bypass (which as of May 2015 also contains [[Interstate 41]]) runs through portions of the city's southwest side, and [[Interstate 794]] comes out of the Marquette interchange eastbound, bends south along the lakefront and crosses the harbor over the [[Hoan Bridge]], then ends near the [[Bay View, Milwaukee|Bay View]] [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] and becomes the \"Lake Parkway\" ([[Wisconsin Highway 794|WIS-794]]).\n\nOne of the distinctive traits of Milwaukee's residential areas are the neighborhoods full of so-called [[Polish flat]]s. These are two-[[family]] [[home]]s with separate entrances, but with the units stacked one on top of another instead of side-by-side. This arrangement enables a family of limited means to purchase both a home and a modestly priced [[rental]] [[apartment]] unit. Since [[Polish-American]] immigrants to the area prized land ownership, this solution, which was prominent in their areas of settlement within the city, came to be associated with them.\n\nThe tallest building in the city is the [[U.S. Bank Center (Milwaukee)|U.S. Bank Center]].\n\n===Climate===\nMilwaukee's location in the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes Region]] often has rapidly changing weather, producing a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfa''), with cold, windy, snowy winters, and warm, humid summers.

The lake breeze is most common between the months of March and July. This onshore flow causes cooler temperatures to move inland usually {{convert|5|to|15|mi|0}}, with much warmer conditions persisting further inland. Because Milwaukee's official climate site, [[Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport]], is only {{convert|3|mi}} from the lake, seasonal temperature variations are less extreme than in many other locations of the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]].\n\nAs the sun sets, the convection current reverses and an offshore flow ensues causing a land breeze. After a land breeze develops, warmer temperatures flow east toward the lakeshore, sometimes causing high temperatures during the late evening. The lake breeze is not a daily occurrence and will not usually form if a southwest, west, or northwest wind generally exceeds {{convert|15|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The lake moderates cold air outbreaks along the lakeshore during winter months.\n\nAside from the lake's influence, overnight lows in downtown Milwaukee year-round are often much warmer than suburban locations because of the [[urban heat island effect]]. Onshore winds elevate daytime [[relative humidity]] levels in Milwaukee as compared to inland locations nearby.\n\nThunderstorms in the region can be dangerous and damaging, bringing [[hail]] and high winds. In rare instances, they can bring a [[tornado]]. However, almost all summer rainfall in the city is brought by these storms.

Many of the new [[immigrants]] who were pouring into the new state of Wisconsin during the middle of the 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked [[wheat]]-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. [[Rail transport|Railroads]] were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's [[harbor]]. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.\n\nThere was intense competition for markets with Chicago, and to a lesser degree, with [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]]. Eventually Chicago won out due to its superior financial and transposition status, as well as being a hub on major railroad lines throughout the United States. Milwaukee did solidify its place as the commercial capital of Wisconsin and an important market in the Midwest.<ref name=\"milwaukeehistory.net\" />\n\n[[File:Menomonee Valley.jpg|thumb|[[Rail tracks]] along the industrial [[Menomonee Valley]], ancestral home of the [[Menominee]] Indians]]\nBecause of its easy access to Lake Michigan and other waterways, Milwaukee's [[Menomonee Valley]] has historically been home to [[manufacturing]], [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], [[Rendering (food processing)|rendering plants]], [[shipping]], and other [[heavy industry]].\n\nReshaping of the valley began with the [[rail transport|railroads]] built by city co-founder [[Byron Kilbourn]] to bring product from Wisconsin's farm interior to the port. By 1862 Milwaukee was the largest shipper of [[wheat]] on the planet, and related industry developed. [[Grain elevator]]s were built and, due to Milwaukee's dominant [[German American|German immigrant population]], [[Brewery|breweries]] sprang up around the processing of [[barley]] and [[hops]]. A number of [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] were constructed, of which the [[Pfister & Vogel]] tannery grew to become the largest in America.\n\nIn 1843 George Burnham and his brother Jonathan opened a [[brickyard]] near 16th Street. When a durable and distinct cream-colored brick came out of the clay beds, other brickyards sprang up to take advantage of this resource. Because many of the city's buildings were built using this material it earned the nickname \"Cream City\", and consequently the brick was called [[Cream City brick]]. By 1881 the Burnham brickyard, which employed 200 men and peaked at 15 million bricks a year, was the largest in the world.\n\n[[Gristmill|Flour mills]], packing plants, breweries, railways and tanneries further industrialized the valley. With the [[marsh]]lands drained and the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic]] and [[Milwaukee River]]s dredged, attention turned to the valley.\n\nAlong with the processing industries, bulk commodity storage and machining and manufacturing entered the scene. The valley was home to the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]], [[Falk Corporation]], [[Cutler-Hammer]], [[Harnischfeger Corporation]], [[Chain Belt Company]], [[Nordberg Manufacturing Company]] and other industry giants.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Milwaukee was home to several pioneer [[brass era]] [[automobile]] makers, including Ogren (1919\u20131922).<ref>{{cite book |last=Clymer |first=Floyd |title=Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925 |location=New York |publisher=Bonanza Books |year=1950 |page=153 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n===Brewing===\n{{further|Beer in Milwaukee}}\n\nMilwaukee became synonymous with [[Germans]] and [[beer]] beginning in the 1840s. The Germans had long enjoyed beer and set up breweries when they arrived in Milwaukee. By 1856, there were more than two dozen breweries in Milwaukee, most of them owned and operated by Germans. Besides making beer for the rest of the nation, Milwaukeeans enjoyed consuming the various beers produced in the city's breweries. As early as 1843, pioneer historian [[James Buck]] recorded 138 taverns in Milwaukee, an average of one per forty residents.
