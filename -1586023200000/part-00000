From the late 19th century to the mid 20th century, the city was a leading manufacturer of carriages and later [[automobiles]], earning it the nickname \"Vehicle City\". [[General Motors]] (GM) was founded in Flint in 1908, and the city grew into an [[Flint, Michigan auto industry|automobile manufacturing powerhouse]] for GM's [[Buick]] and [[Chevrolet]] divisions, especially [[Economic_history_of_the_United_States#Post-World_War_II_prosperity:_1945\u20131973|after]] [[World War II]] up until the [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|early 1980s recession]].

The city sank into a deep [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] after GM significantly downsized its workforce in the area from a 1978 high of 80,000 to under 8,000 by 2010. From 1960 to 2010, the population of the city nearly halved from 196,940 to 102,434.

The [[Flint River (Michigan)|Flint River]] had several convenient fords which became points of contention among rival tribes, as attested by the presence of arrowheads and burial mounds near it. Some of the city currently resides atop ancient Ojibwa burial grounds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2009/12/ancestral_remains_recovered_fr.html|title=Ancestral remains recovered from American Indian burial ground in Flint|work=MLive.com|access-date=July 12, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===19th century: lumber and the beginnings of the automobile industry===\nIn 1819, Jacob Smith, a fur trader on cordial terms with both the local Ojibwas and the territorial government founded a trading post at the Grand Traverse of the Flint River. On several occasions, Smith negotiated land exchanges with the Ojibwas on behalf of the U.S. government, and he was highly regarded on both sides. Smith apportioned many of his holdings to his children. As the ideal stopover on the [[Saginaw Trail|overland route]] between Detroit and [[Saginaw]], Flint grew into a small but prosperous village, and incorporated in 1855.  The 1860 U.S. census indicated that Genesee County had a population of 22,498 of Michigan's 750,000.\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, Flint became a center of the Michigan lumber industry.  Revenue from lumber funded the establishment of a local carriage-making industry.  As horse-drawn carriages gave way to the automobiles, Flint then naturally grew into a major player in the nascent auto industry. [[Buick Motor Company]], after a rudimentary start in Detroit, soon moved to Flint.  AC Spark Plug (now part of [[Delphi Automotive|Delphi]]) originated in Flint.  These were followed by several now-defunct automobile marques such as the [[Dort Motor Car Company|Dort]], [[Little (automobile)|Little]], [[Flint (automobile)|Flint]], and [[Mason Truck|Mason]] brands.  Chevrolet's first (and for many years, main) manufacturing facility was also in Flint, although the Chevrolet headquarters were in Detroit.  For a brief period, all [[Chevrolet]]s and [[Buick]]s were built in Flint.\n\n===Early and mid-20th century: the auto industry takes shape===\n{{Main|Flint, Michigan auto industry|History of General Motors}}\nIn 1904, local entrepreneur [[William C. Durant]] was brought in to manage Buick, which became the largest manufacturer of automobiles by 1908. In 1908, Durant founded [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], filing incorporation papers in New Jersey, with headquarters in Flint. GM moved its headquarters to Detroit in the mid-1920s.<ref>[http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/history/gmhis1900.html General Motors | Corporate Information \u2013 History | GM<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610221410/http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/history/gmhis1900.html |date=June 10, 2011 }}</ref> Durant lost control of GM twice during his lifetime. On the first occasion, he befriended [[Louis Chevrolet]] and founded [[Chevrolet]], which was a runaway success. He used the capital from this success to buy back share control. He later lost decisive control again, permanently. Durant experienced financial ruin in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] and subsequently ran a bowling alley in Flint until the time of his death in 1947.\n\nThe city's mayors were targeted for recall twice, Mayor David Cuthbertson in 1924 and Mayor [[William H. McKeighan]] in 1927. Recall supporters in both cases were jailed by the police. Cuthbertson had angered the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] by the appointment of a Catholic police chief. The KKK lead the recall effort and supported [[Judson L. Transue|Judson Transue]], Cutbertson's elected successor. Transue however did not remove the police chief.

The decades of the 1950s and 1960s are seen as the height of Flint's prosperity and influence.  They culminated with the establishment of many local institutions, most notably including the [[Flint Cultural Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flintcultural.org/ |title=Flint Cultural Center |publisher=Flintcultural.org |accessdate=May 21, 2012}}</ref>  This landmark remains one of the city's chief commercial and artistic draws to this day. On June 8, 1953, The [[1953 Flint-Beecher tornado]], a large F5 [[tornado]], struck the city, killing 116 people.\n\n===Late 20th century: deindustrialization and demographic changes===\nSince the late 1960s through the end of the 20th century, Flint has suffered from [[disinvestment]], [[deindustrialization]], [[depopulation]], [[urban decay]], as well as high rates of crime, unemployment and poverty. Initially, this took the form of \"[[white flight]]\" that afflicted many urban industrialized American towns and cities.  Given Flint's role in the automotive industry, this decline was exacerbated by the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the U.S. auto industry's subsequent loss of market share to imports.\n\nIn the 1980s, the rate of deindustrialization accelerated again with local GM employment falling from a 1978 high of 80,000 to under 8,000 by 2010. Only 10% of the manufacturing work force from its height remains in Flint. Many factors have been blamed, including [[outsourcing]], [[offshoring]], increased [[automation]], and moving jobs to non-[[Labor unions in the United States|union]] facilities.\n\nThis decline was highlighted in the film ''[[Roger & Me]]'' by [[Michael Moore]] (the title refers to [[Roger B. Smith]], the CEO of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] during the 1980s). Also highlighted in Moore's documentary was the failure of city officials to reverse the trends with entertainment options (e.g. the now-demolished [[AutoWorld (theme park)|AutoWorld]]) during the 1980s. Moore, a native of [[Davison, Michigan|Davison]] (a Flint suburb), revisited Flint in his later movies, including ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'', ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''\nand ''[[Fahrenheit 11/9]]''\n[[File:Buickcityflint.JPG|thumb|250px|The demolition site of Buick City, for many years [[General Motors]]' flagship factory on the North side.]]\n\n===21st century===\n\n====First financial emergency: 2002\u20132004====\nBy 2002, Flint had accrued $30 million in debt.<ref name=fj2>{{cite news|last=Mostafavi|first=Beata|title=What happened last time?

The emergency financial manager displaced the temporary mayor, [[Darnell Earley]], in the city administrator position.\n\nIn August 2002, city voters elected former Mayor [[James W. Rutherford|James Rutherford]] to finish the remainder of Stanley's term of office.  On September 24,  Kurtz commissioned a salary and wage study for top city officials from an outside accounting and consulting firm.  The financial manager then installed a new code enforcement program for annual rental inspections and emergency [[demolition]]s.  On October 8, Kurtz ordered cuts in pay for the mayor (from $107,000 to $24,000) and the City Council members (from $23,000 to $18,000).  He also eliminated insurance benefits for most officials.  After spending $245,000 fighting the takeover, the City Council ended the lawsuits on October 14.  Immediately thereafter on October 16, a new interim financial plan was put in place by the manager.  This plan initiated controls on hiring, overnight travel and spending by city employees.  On November 12, Kurtz directed the city's retirement board to stop unusual pension benefits, which had decreased some retiree pensions by 3.5%.  Kurtz sought the return of overpayments to the pension fund.  However, in December, the state attorney general stated that Emergency Financial Managers do not have authority over the retirement system.  With contract talks stalled, Kurtz stated that there either need to be cuts or layoffs to union employees.  That same month, the city's recreation centers were temporarily closed.<ref name=fj2/>\n\nEmergency measures continued in 2003.  In May, Kurtz increased water and sewer bills by 11% and shut down operations of the ombudsman's office.  In September 2003, a 4% pay cut was agreed to by the city's largest union.  In October, Kurtz moved in favor of infrastructure improvements, authorizing $1 million in [[sewerage|sewer]] and road projects. [[Don Williamson]] was elected a full-term mayor and sworn in on November 10.  In December, city audits reported nearly $14 million in reductions in the city deficit.  For the 2003\u20132004 budget year, estimates decreased that amount to between $6 million and $8 million.<ref name=fj2/>\n\nWith pressure from Kurtz for large layoffs and replacement of the board on February 17, 2004, the City Retirement Board agreed to four proposals reducing the amount of the city's contribution into the system.  On March 24, Kurtz indicated that he would raise the City Council's and the Mayor's pay and in May, Kurtz laid off 10 workers as part of 35 job cuts for the 2004\u201305 budget.  In June 2004, Kurtz reported that the financial emergency was over.<ref name=fj2/>\n\n====Redevelopment====\n[[File:First National Bank and Trust Company Building - Flint Michigan.jpg|thumb|Renovated First National Bank building in downtown Flint.]]\nIn November 2013, [[American Cast Iron Pipe Company]] (ACIPCO), a [[Birmingham, Alabama]] based company, became the first to build a production facility in Flint's former [[Buick City]] site purchasing the property from the [[RACER Trust]].<ref>[http://www.freep.com/article/20131113/BUSINESS0101/311130151/Flint-Buick-City-American-Cast-Iron-Pipe-Co-General-Motors-RACER-GM Pipe maker to add 60 jobs at Flint's Buick City property] ''Detroit Free Press'', November 13, 2013</ref>\n\nCommercially, local organizations have attempted to pool their resources in the central business district and to expand and bolster higher education at four local institutions.

From the late 19th century to the mid 20th century, the city was a leading manufacturer of carriages and later [[automobiles]], earning it the nickname \"Vehicle City\". [[General Motors]] (GM) was founded in Flint in 1908, and the city grew into an [[Flint, Michigan auto industry|automobile manufacturing powerhouse]] for GM's [[Buick]] and [[Chevrolet]] divisions, especially [[Economic_history_of_the_United_States#Post-World_War_II_prosperity:_1945\u20131973|after]] [[World War II]] up until the [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|early 1980s recession]].

The city sank into a deep [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] after GM significantly downsized its workforce in the area from a 1978 high of 80,000 to under 8,000 by 2010. From 1960 to 2010, the population of the city nearly halved from 196,940 to 102,434.

The [[Flint River (Michigan)|Flint River]] had several convenient fords which became points of contention among rival tribes, as attested by the presence of arrowheads and burial mounds near it. Some of the city currently resides atop ancient Ojibwa burial grounds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2009/12/ancestral_remains_recovered_fr.html|title=Ancestral remains recovered from American Indian burial ground in Flint|work=MLive.com|access-date=July 12, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===19th century: lumber and the beginnings of the automobile industry===\nIn 1819, Jacob Smith, a fur trader on cordial terms with both the local Ojibwas and the territorial government founded a trading post at the Grand Traverse of the Flint River. On several occasions, Smith negotiated land exchanges with the Ojibwas on behalf of the U.S. government, and he was highly regarded on both sides. Smith apportioned many of his holdings to his children. As the ideal stopover on the [[Saginaw Trail|overland route]] between Detroit and [[Saginaw]], Flint grew into a small but prosperous village, and incorporated in 1855.  The 1860 U.S. census indicated that Genesee County had a population of 22,498 of Michigan's 750,000.\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, Flint became a center of the Michigan lumber industry.  Revenue from lumber funded the establishment of a local carriage-making industry.  As horse-drawn carriages gave way to the automobiles, Flint then naturally grew into a major player in the nascent auto industry. [[Buick Motor Company]], after a rudimentary start in Detroit, soon moved to Flint.  AC Spark Plug (now part of [[Delphi Automotive|Delphi]]) originated in Flint.  These were followed by several now-defunct automobile marques such as the [[Dort Motor Car Company|Dort]], [[Little (automobile)|Little]], [[Flint (automobile)|Flint]], and [[Mason Truck|Mason]] brands.  Chevrolet's first (and for many years, main) manufacturing facility was also in Flint, although the Chevrolet headquarters were in Detroit.  For a brief period, all [[Chevrolet]]s and [[Buick]]s were built in Flint.\n\n===Early and mid-20th century: the auto industry takes shape===\n{{Main|Flint, Michigan auto industry|History of General Motors}}\nIn 1904, local entrepreneur [[William C. Durant]] was brought in to manage Buick, which became the largest manufacturer of automobiles by 1908. In 1908, Durant founded [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], filing incorporation papers in New Jersey, with headquarters in Flint. GM moved its headquarters to Detroit in the mid-1920s.<ref>[http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/history/gmhis1900.html General Motors | Corporate Information \u2013 History | GM<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610221410/http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/history/gmhis1900.html |date=June 10, 2011 }}</ref> Durant lost control of GM twice during his lifetime. On the first occasion, he befriended [[Louis Chevrolet]] and founded [[Chevrolet]], which was a runaway success. He used the capital from this success to buy back share control. He later lost decisive control again, permanently. Durant experienced financial ruin in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] and subsequently ran a bowling alley in Flint until the time of his death in 1947.\n\nThe city's mayors were targeted for recall twice, Mayor David Cuthbertson in 1924 and Mayor [[William H. McKeighan]] in 1927. Recall supporters in both cases were jailed by the police. Cuthbertson had angered the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] by the appointment of a Catholic police chief. The KKK lead the recall effort and supported [[Judson L. Transue|Judson Transue]], Cutbertson's elected successor. Transue however did not remove the police chief.  McKeighan survived his recall only to face conspiracy charges in 1928.<ref>{{cite news |first=James M. |last=Miller |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Crackdowns on 'reds,' booze didn't silence decade's roar |url=http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920main.html |work=[[Flint Journal]]:  Journal of the 20th Century |publisher=Booth Newspapers |date= |accessdate=March 6, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527003224/http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920main.html|archivedate=May 27, 2011}}</ref> McKeighan was under investigation for a multitude of crimes which angered city leaders enough to push for changes in the city charter.<ref name=fj20c>{{cite news|last1=Crawford|first1=Kim|title=Flint mayor commanded attention from \u2013 voters, police|url=http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920flintmayor.html|accessdate=October 24, 2014|work=Journal of the 20th Century|publisher=The Flint Journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041109020208/http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920flintmayor.html|archivedate=November 9, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 1928, the city adopted a new city charter with a council-manager form of government.

The decades of the 1950s and 1960s are seen as the height of Flint's prosperity and influence.  They culminated with the establishment of many local institutions, most notably including the [[Flint Cultural Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flintcultural.org/ |title=Flint Cultural Center |publisher=Flintcultural.org |accessdate=May 21, 2012}}</ref>  This landmark remains one of the city's chief commercial and artistic draws to this day. On June 8, 1953, The [[1953 Flint-Beecher tornado]], a large F5 [[tornado]], struck the city, killing 116 people.\n\n===Late 20th century: deindustrialization and demographic changes===\nSince the late 1960s through the end of the 20th century, Flint has suffered from [[disinvestment]], [[deindustrialization]], [[depopulation]], [[urban decay]], as well as high rates of crime, unemployment and poverty. Initially, this took the form of \"[[white flight]]\" that afflicted many urban industrialized American towns and cities.  Given Flint's role in the automotive industry, this decline was exacerbated by the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the U.S. auto industry's subsequent loss of market share to imports.\n\nIn the 1980s, the rate of deindustrialization accelerated again with local GM employment falling from a 1978 high of 80,000 to under 8,000 by 2010. Only 10% of the manufacturing work force from its height remains in Flint. Many factors have been blamed, including [[outsourcing]], [[offshoring]], increased [[automation]], and moving jobs to non-[[Labor unions in the United States|union]] facilities.\n\nThis decline was highlighted in the film ''[[Roger & Me]]'' by [[Michael Moore]] (the title refers to [[Roger B. Smith]], the CEO of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] during the 1980s). Also highlighted in Moore's documentary was the failure of city officials to reverse the trends with entertainment options (e.g. the now-demolished [[AutoWorld (theme park)|AutoWorld]]) during the 1980s. Moore, a native of [[Davison, Michigan|Davison]] (a Flint suburb), revisited Flint in his later movies, including ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'', ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''\nand ''[[Fahrenheit 11/9]]''\n[[File:Buickcityflint.JPG|thumb|250px|The demolition site of Buick City, for many years [[General Motors]]' flagship factory on the North side.]]\n\n===21st century===\n\n====First financial emergency: 2002\u20132004====\nBy 2002, Flint had accrued $30 million in debt.<ref name=fj2>{{cite news|last=Mostafavi|first=Beata|title=What happened last time?

The emergency financial manager displaced the temporary mayor, [[Darnell Earley]], in the city administrator position.\n\nIn August 2002, city voters elected former Mayor [[James W. Rutherford|James Rutherford]] to finish the remainder of Stanley's term of office.  On September 24,  Kurtz commissioned a salary and wage study for top city officials from an outside accounting and consulting firm.  The financial manager then installed a new code enforcement program for annual rental inspections and emergency [[demolition]]s.  On October 8, Kurtz ordered cuts in pay for the mayor (from $107,000 to $24,000) and the City Council members (from $23,000 to $18,000).  He also eliminated insurance benefits for most officials.  After spending $245,000 fighting the takeover, the City Council ended the lawsuits on October 14.  Immediately thereafter on October 16, a new interim financial plan was put in place by the manager.  This plan initiated controls on hiring, overnight travel and spending by city employees.  On November 12, Kurtz directed the city's retirement board to stop unusual pension benefits, which had decreased some retiree pensions by 3.5%.  Kurtz sought the return of overpayments to the pension fund.  However, in December, the state attorney general stated that Emergency Financial Managers do not have authority over the retirement system.  With contract talks stalled, Kurtz stated that there either need to be cuts or layoffs to union employees.  That same month, the city's recreation centers were temporarily closed.<ref name=fj2/>\n\nEmergency measures continued in 2003.  In May, Kurtz increased water and sewer bills by 11% and shut down operations of the ombudsman's office.  In September 2003, a 4% pay cut was agreed to by the city's largest union.  In October, Kurtz moved in favor of infrastructure improvements, authorizing $1 million in [[sewerage|sewer]] and road projects. [[Don Williamson]] was elected a full-term mayor and sworn in on November 10.  In December, city audits reported nearly $14 million in reductions in the city deficit.  For the 2003\u20132004 budget year, estimates decreased that amount to between $6 million and $8 million.<ref name=fj2/>\n\nWith pressure from Kurtz for large layoffs and replacement of the board on February 17, 2004, the City Retirement Board agreed to four proposals reducing the amount of the city's contribution into the system.  On March 24, Kurtz indicated that he would raise the City Council's and the Mayor's pay and in May, Kurtz laid off 10 workers as part of 35 job cuts for the 2004\u201305 budget.  In June 2004, Kurtz reported that the financial emergency was over.<ref name=fj2/>\n\n====Redevelopment====\n[[File:First National Bank and Trust Company Building - Flint Michigan.jpg|thumb|Renovated First National Bank building in downtown Flint.]]\nIn November 2013, [[American Cast Iron Pipe Company]] (ACIPCO), a [[Birmingham, Alabama]] based company, became the first to build a production facility in Flint's former [[Buick City]] site purchasing the property from the [[RACER Trust]].<ref>[http://www.freep.com/article/20131113/BUSINESS0101/311130151/Flint-Buick-City-American-Cast-Iron-Pipe-Co-General-Motors-RACER-GM Pipe maker to add 60 jobs at Flint's Buick City property] ''Detroit Free Press'', November 13, 2013</ref>\n\nCommercially, local organizations have attempted to pool their resources in the central business district and to expand and bolster higher education at four local institutions.

Although it's not specified what species the Little Critter is, he resembles a small and furry (maybe a [[rodent]]-like creature) such as a [[porcupine]] or [[hedgehog]] (due to the hair looking like porcupine or hedgehog quills) or even a [[capybara]], [[guinea pig]], [[hamster]], [[wombat]], or an [[aardvark]] (like Arthur from the [[Marc Brown]] TV series [[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]). Little Critter first appeared in the 1975 book ''Just for You''. This book is sometimes mis-titled ''Just for Yu'' because of the childlike mistake on the front cover (see picture). \n\nThe following books feature Little Critter.\n\n===Little Critter main series===\nPublished in the Golden Books \"Look-Look Books\" series <br>\nIndividual books may ''also'' be available in special editions\n*''Just For You'' (1975) {{ISBN|0-307-12542-4}} <!---First edition hardcover ISBN---> (first hardcover printing has 5 more pages of story and artwork than all subsequent printings, including \"I wanted to build a beautiful house just for you, but I hurt myself\")\n*''Just Me and My Dad'' (1977) <!---Yes, Just Me and My Dad was published in 1977, per Amazon ASIN: B000GYG8M4, it has been reprinted a lot since then--->\n*''The New Baby'' (1980) <!---Yes, The New Baby was published in 1980, per Amazon ASIN: B000MUBQ1A, it has been reprinted a lot since then--->\n*''All by Myself'' (1983)\n*''I Was So Mad'' (1983)\n*''Just Go To Bed'' (1983)\n*''Just Grandma and Me'' (1983)\n*''Just Grandpa and Me'' (1983)\n*''Me Too!''

The book centers on an unlucky teenage boy named Stanley Yelnats, who is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility in a desert in Texas, after being falsely accused of theft. The plot explores the history of the area and how the actions of several characters in the past have affected Stanley's life in the present. These interconnecting stories touch on themes such as racism, homelessness, illiteracy, and arranged marriage.\n\nThe book was both a critical and commercial success. Much of the praise for the book has centered around its complex plot, interesting characters, and representation of people of color and incarcerated youth. It won the 1998 U.S. [[National Book Award for Young People's Literature]] and the 1999 [[Newbery Medal]] for the year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\". In 2012 it was ranked number six among all-time children's novels in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]''.\n\n''Holes'' was adapted by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] as a [[Holes (film)|feature film of the same name]] released in 2003. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, grossing $71 million, and was released in conjunction with the book companion ''Stanley Yelnats's Survival Guide to Camp Green Lake''. A sequel to ''Holes'' entitled ''[[Small Steps (novel)|Small Steps]]'' was published in 2006 and centers on one of the secondary characters in the novel, Armpit.\n\nPART ONE\nYOU ARE ENTERING CAMP GREEN LAKE\n\n1\nThere is no lake at Camp Green Lake. There once was a very large lake here, the\nlargest lake in Texas. That was over a hundred years ago. Now it is just a dry, flat\nwasteland.\nThere used to be a town of Green Lake as well. The town shriveled and dried up\nalong with the lake, and the people who lived there.\nDuring the summer the daytime temperature hovers around ninety-five degrees in\nthe shade\u2014 if you can find any shade. There's not much shade in a big dry lake.\nThe only trees are two old oaks on the eastern edge of the \"lake.\" A hammock is\nstretched between the two trees, and a log cabin stands behind that.\nThe campers are forbidden to lie in the hammock. It belongs to the Warden. The\nWarden owns the shade.\nOut on the lake, rattlesnakes and scorpions find shade under rocks and in the holes\ndug by the campers.\nHere's a good rule to remember about rattlesnakes and scorpions: If you don't\nbother them, they won't bother you.\nUsually.\nBeing bitten by a scorpion or even a rattlesnake is not the worst thing that can\nhappen to you. You won't die.\nUsually.\nSometimes a camper will try to be bitten by a scorpion, or even a small rattlesnake.\nThen he will get to spend a day or two recovering in his tent, instead of having to dig a\nhole out on the lake\nBut you don't want to be bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard. That's the worst thing\nthat can happen to you. You will die a slow and painful death.\nAlways.\nIf you get bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard, you might as well go into the shade of\nthe oak trees and lie in the hammock.\nThere is nothing anyone can do to you anymore.\n\n2\nThe reader is probably asking: Why would anyone go to Camp Green Lake?\nMost campers weren't given a choice. Camp Green Lake is a camp for bad boys.\nIf you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn\nhim into a good boy.\nThat was what some people thought.\n\n3\nStanley Yelnats was given a choice. The judge said, \"You may go to jail, or you\nmay go to Camp Green Lake.\"\nStanley was from a poor family. He had never been to camp before.\n\n3\nStanley Yelnats was the only passenger on the bus, not counting the driver or the\nguard The guard sat next to the driver with his seat turned around facing Stanley A rifle\nlay across his lap\nStanley was sitting about ten rows back, handcuffed to his armrest His backpack lay\non the seat next to him It contained his toothbrush, toothpaste, and a box of stationery\nhis mother had given him He'd promised to write to her at least once a week.\nHe looked out the window, although there wasn't much to see\u2014 mostly fields of hay\nand cotton. He was on a long bus ride to nowhere The bus wasn't air-conditioned, and\nthe hot, heavy air was almost as stifling as the handcuffs.\nStanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for\na while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed\nanimals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it.\nSometimes he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an\nobstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now\nStanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games Maybe he'd make some\nfriends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake.\nHe didn't have any friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle\nschool often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel\ncomments without realizing it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell,\ntaught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid\nm the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as\nthe other boy Mrs. Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much\nembarrassment she had caused both of them.\nStanley was arrested later that day.\nHe looked at the guard who sat slumped in his seat and wondered if he had fallen\nasleep. The guard was wearing sunglasses, so Stanley couldn't see his eyes.\nStanley was not a bad kid. He was innocent of the crime for which he was convicted\nHe'd just been in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nIt was all because of his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather!\nHe smiled. It was a family joke. Whenever anything went wrong, they always\nblamed Stanley's no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.\nSupposedly, he had a great-great-grandfather who had stolen a pig from a\none-legged Gypsy, and she put a curse on him and all his descendants. Stanley and his\nparents didn't believe in curses, of course, but whenever anything went wrong, it felt\ngood to be able to blame someone\nThings went wrong a lot. They always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong\ntime.\n\n4\nHe looked out the window at the vast emptiness. He watched the rise and fall of a\ntelephone wire. In his mind he could hear his father's gruff voice softly singing to him\n\"If only, if only,\" the woodpecker sighs,\n\"The bark on the tree was just a little bit softer.\"\nWhile the wolf waits below, hungry and lonely,\nHe cries to the moo\u2014 oo\u2014 oon,\n\"If only, if only.\"\nIt was a song his father used to sing to him. The melody was sweet and sad, but\nStanley's favorite part was when his father would howl the word \"moon \"\nThe bus hit a small bump and the guard sat up, instantly alert.\nStanley's father was an inventor. To be a successful inventor you need three things:\nintelligence, perseverance, and just a little bit of luck.\nStanley's father was smart and had a lot of perseverance. Once he started a project\nhe would work on it for years, often going days without sleep. He just never had any\nluck.\nEvery time an experiment failed, Stanley could hear him cursing his\ndirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-grandfather.\nStanley's father was also named Stanley Yelnats. Stanley's father's full name was\nStanley Yelnats III. Our Stanley is Stanley Yelnats IV.\nEveryone in his family had always liked the fact that \"Stanley Yelnats\" was spelled\nthe same frontward and backward. So they kept naming their sons Stanley. Stanley was\nan only child, as was every other Stanley Yelnats before him.\nAll of them had something else in common. Despite their awful luck, they always\nremained hopeful. As Stanley's father liked to say, \"I learn from failure.\"\nBut perhaps that was part of the curse as well. If Stanley and his father weren't\nalways hopeful, then it wouldn't hurt so much every time their hopes were crushed.\n\"Not every Stanley Yelnats has been a failure,\" Stanley's mother often pointed out,\nwhenever Stanley or his father became so discouraged that they actually started to\nbelieve in the curse. The first Stanley Yelnats, Stanley's great-grandfather, had made a\nfortune m the stock market. \"He couldn't have been too unlucky.\"\nAt such times she neglected to mention the bad luck that befell the first Stanley\nYelnats. He lost his entire fortune when he was moving from New York to California.\nHis stagecoach was robbed by the outlaw Kissin' Kate Barlow.\nIf it weren't for that, Stanley's family would now be living in a mansion on a beach\nin California. Instead, they were crammed in a tiny apartment that smelled of burning\nrubber and foot odor.\nIf only, if only . . .\nThe apartment smelled the way it did because Stanley's father was trying to invent a\nway to recycle old sneakers. \"The first person who finds a use for old sneakers,\" he said,\n\"will be a very rich man.\"\nIt was this latest project that led to Stanley's arrest.\nThe bus ride became increasingly bumpy because the road was no longer paved.\n\n5\n\nActually, Stanley had been impressed when he first found out that his\ngreat-grandfather was robbed by Kissin' Kate Barlow. True, he would have preferred\nliving on the beach in California, but it was still kind of cool to have someone in your\nfamily robbed by a famous outlaw.\nKate Barlow didn't actually kiss Stanley's great-grandfather. That would have been\nreally cool, but she only kissed the men she killed. Instead, she robbed him and left him\nstranded in the middle of the desert.\n\"He was lucky to have survived,\" Stanley's mother was quick to point out.\nThe bus was slowing down. The guard grunted as he stretched his arms.\n\"Welcome to Camp Green Lake,\" said the driver.\nStanley looked out the dirty window. He couldn't see a lake.\nAnd hardly anything was green.\n\n4\nStanley felt somewhat dazed as the guard unlocked his handcuffs and led him off\nthe bus. He'd been on the bus for over eight hours.\n\"Be careful,\" the bus driver said as Stanley walked down the steps.\nStanley wasn't sure if the bus driver meant for him to be careful going down the\nsteps, or if he was telling him to be careful at Camp Green Lake. \"Thanks for the ride,\"\nhe said. His mouth was dry and his throat hurt. He stepped onto the hard, dry dirt. There\nwas a band of sweat around his wrist where the handcuff had been.\nThe land was barren and desolate. He could see a few rundown buildings and some\ntents. Farther away there was a cabin beneath two tall trees. Those two trees were the\nonly plant life he could see. There weren't even weeds.\nThe guard led Stanley to a small building. A sign on front said, YOU ARE\nENTERING CAMP GREEN LAKE JUVENILE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. Next\nto it was another sign which declared that it was a violation of the Texas Penal Code to\nbring guns, explosives, weapons, drugs, or alcohol onto the premises.\nAs Stanley read the sign he couldn't help but think, Well, duh!\nThe guard led Stanley into the building, where he felt the welcome relief of\nair-conditioning.\nA man was sitting with his feet up on a desk. He turned his head when Stanley and\nthe guard entered, but otherwise didn't move. Even though he was inside, he wore\nsunglasses and a cowboy hat. He also held a can of soda, and the sight of it made\nStanley even more aware of his own thirst.\nHe waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign.\n\"That's a lot of sunflower seeds,\" the bus guard said\nStanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the\ndesk.\n\"I quit smoking last month,\" said the man in the cowboy hat. He had a tattoo of a\nrattlesnake on his arm, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle \"I\nused to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week \"\n\n6\n\nThe guard laughed.\nThere must have been a small refrigerator behind his desk, because the man in the\ncowboy hat produced two more cans of soda. For a second Stanley hoped that one\nmight be for him, but the man gave one to the guard and said the other was for the\ndriver.\n\"Nine hours here, and now nine hours back,\" the guard grumbled. \"What a day.\"\nStanley thought about the long, miserable bus ride and felt a little sorry for the\nguard and the bus driver.\nThe man in the cowboy hat spit sunflower seed shells into a wastepaper basket.\nThen he walked around the desk to Stanley. \"My name is Mr. Sir,\" he said \"Whenever\nyou speak to me you must call me by my name, is that clear?\"\nStanley hesitated. \"Uh, yes, Mr. Sir,\" he said, though he couldn't imagine that was\nreally the man's name.\n\"You're not in the Girl Scouts anymore,\" Mr. Sir said.\nStanley had to remove his clothes in front of Mr. Sir, who made sure he wasn't\nhiding anything. He was then given two sets of clothes and a towel. Each set consisted\nof a long-sleeve orange jumpsuit, an orange T-shirt, and yellow socks. Stanley wasn't\nsure if the socks had been yellow originally.\nHe was also given white sneakers, an orange cap, and a canteen made of heavy\nplastic, which unfortunately was empty. The cap had a piece of cloth sewn on the back\nof it, for neck protection.\nStanley got dressed. The clothes smelled like soap.\nMr. Sir told him he should wear one set to work in and one set for relaxation.\nLaundry was done every three days. On that day his work clothes would be washed.\nThen the other set would become his work clothes, and he would get clean clothes to\nwear while resting.\n\"You are to dig one hole each day, including Saturdays and Sundays. Each hole\nmust be five feet deep, and five feet across in every direction. Your shovel is your\nmeasuring stick. Breakfast is served at 4:30.\"\nStanley must have looked surprised, because Mr. Sir went on to explain that they\nstarted early to avoid the hottest part of the day. \"No one is going to baby-sit you,\" he\nadded. \"The longer it takes you to dig, the longer you will be out in the sun. If you dig\nup anything interesting, you are to report it to me or any other counselor. When you\nfinish, the rest of the day is yours.\"\nStanley nodded to show he understood.\n\"This isn't a Girl Scout camp,\" said Mr. Sir.\nHe checked Stanley's backpack and allowed him to keep it. Then he led Stanley\noutside into the blazing heat.\n\"Take a good look around you,\" Mr. Sir said. \"What do you see?\"\nStanley looked out across the vast wasteland. The air seemed thick with heat and\ndirt. \"Not much,\" he said, then hastily added, \"Mr. Sir.\"\nMr. Sir laughed. \"You see any guard towers?\"\n\"No.\"\n\n7\n\n\"How about an electric fence?\"\n\"No, Mr. Sir.\"\n\"There's no fence at all, is there?\"\n\"No, Mr. Sir.\"\n\"You want to run away?\" Mr. Sir asked him.\nStanley looked back at him, unsure what he meant.\n\"If you want to run away, go ahead, start running. I'm not going to stop you.\"\nStanley didn't know what kind of game Mr. Sir was playing.\n\"I see you're looking at my gun. Don't worry. I'm not going to shoot you.\" He tapped\nhis holster. \"This is for yellow-spotted lizards. I wouldn't waste a bullet on you.\"\n\"I'm not going to run away,\" Stanley said.\n\"Good thinking,\" said Mr. Sir. \"Nobody runs away from here. We don't need a\nfence. Know why? Because we've got the only water for a hundred miles. You want to\nrun away? You'll be buzzard food in three days.\"\nStanley could see some kids dressed in orange and carrying shovels dragging\nthemselves toward the tents.\n\"You thirsty?\" asked Mr. Sir.\n\"Yes, Mr. Sir,\" Stanley said gratefully.\n\"Well, you better get used to it. You're going to be thirsty for the next eighteen\nmonths.\"\n\n5\nThere were six large gray tents, and each one had a black letter on it: A, B, C, D, E,\nor F. The first five tents were for the campers. The counselors slept in F.\nStanley was assigned to D tent. Mr. Pendanski was his counselor.\n\"My name is easy to remember,\" said Mr. Pendanski as he shook hands with\nStanley just outside the tent. \"Three easy words: pen, dance, key.\"\nMr. Sir returned to the office.\nMr. Pendanski was younger than Mr. Sir, and not nearly as scary looking. The top\nof his head was shaved so close it was almost bald, but his face was covered in a thick\ncurly black beard. His nose was badly sunburned.\n\"Mr. Sir isn't really so bad,\" said Mr. Pendanski. \"He's just been in a bad mood ever\nsince he quit smoking. The person you've got to worry about is the Warden. There's\nreally only one rule at Camp Green Lake: Don't upset the Warden.\"\nStanley nodded, as if he understood.\n\"I want you to know, Stanley, that I respect you,\" Mr. Pendanski said. \"I understand\nyou've made some bad mistakes in your life. Otherwise you wouldn't be here. But\neveryone makes mistakes. You may have done some bad things, but that doesn't mean\nyou're a bad kid.\"\nStanley nodded. It seemed pointless to try and tell his counselor that he was\ninnocent. He figured that everyone probably said that. He didn't want Mr.\nPen-dance-key to think he had a bad attitude.\n\n8\n\"I'm going to help you turn your life around,\" said his counselor. \"But you're going\nto have to help, too. Can I count on your help?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Stanley said.\nMr. Pendanski said, \"Good,\" and patted Stanley on the back.\nTwo boys, each carrying a shovel, were coming across the compound. Mr.\nPendanski called to them. \"Rex! Alan! I want you to come say hello to Stanley. He's the\nnewest member of our team.\"\nThe boys glanced wearily at Stanley.\nThey were dripping with sweat, and their faces were so dirty that it took Stanley a\nmoment to notice that one kid was white and the other black.\n\"What happened to Barf Bag?\" asked the black kid.\n\"Lewis is still in the hospital,\" said Mr. Pendanski. \"He won't be returning.\" He told\nthe boys to come shake Stanley's hand and introduce themselves, \"like gentlemen.\"\n\"Hi,\" the white kid grunted.\n\"That's Alan,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\n\"My name's not Alan,\" the boy said. \"It's Squid. And that's X-Ray.\"\n\"Hey,\" said X-Ray. He smiled and shook Stanley's hand. He wore glasses, but they\nwere so dirty that Stanley wondered how he could see out of them.\nMr. Pendanski told Alan to go to the Rec Hall and bring the other boys to meet\nStanley. Then he led him inside the tent.\nThere were seven cots, each one less than two feet from the one next to it.\n\"Which was Lewis's cot?\" Mr. Pendanski asked.\n\"Barf Bag slept here,\" said X-Ray, kicking at one of the beds.\n\"All right, Stanley, that'll be yours,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\nStanley looked at the cot and nodded. He wasn't particularly thrilled about sleeping\nin the same cot that had been used by somebody named Barf Bag.\nSeven crates were stacked in two piles at one side of the tent. The open end of the\ncrates faced outward. Stanley put his backpack, change of clothes, and towel in what\nused to be Barf Bag's crate. It was at the bottom of the stack that had three in it.\nSquid returned with four other boys. The first three were introduced by Mr.\nPendanski as Jose, Theodore, and Ricky. They called themselves Magnet, Armpit, and\nZigzag.\n\"They all have nicknames,\" explained Mr. Pendanski. \"However, I prefer to use the\nnames their parents gave them\u2014 the names that society will recognize them by when\nthey return to become useful and hardworking members of society.\"\n\"It ain't just a nickname,\" X-Ray told Mr. Pendanski. He tapped the rim of his\nglasses. \"I can see inside you, Mom. You've got a big fat heart.\"\nThe last boy either didn't have a real name or else he didn't have a nickname. Both\nMr. Pendanski and X-Ray called him Zero.\n\"You know why his name's Zero?\" asked Mr. Pendanski. \"Because there's nothing\ninside his head.\" He smiled and playfully shook Zero's shoulder.\nZero said nothing.\n\"And that's Mom!\" a boy said.\n\n9\nMr. Pendanski smiled at him. \"If it makes you feel better to call me Mom, Theodore,\ngo ahead and call me Mom.\" He turned to Stanley. \"If you have questions, Theodore\nwill help you. You got that, Theodore. I'm depending on you.\"\nTheodore spit a thin line of saliva between his teeth, causing some of the other boys\nto complain about the need to keep their \"home\" sanitary.\n\"You were all new here once,\" said Mr. Pendanski, \"and you all know what it feels\nlike. I'm counting on every one of you to help Stanley.\"\nStanley looked at the ground.\nMr. Pendanski left the tent, and soon the other boys began to file out as well, taking\ntheir towels and change of clothes with them. Stanley was relieved to be left alone, but\nhe was so thirsty he felt as if he would die if he didn't get something to drink soon.\n\"Hey, uh, Theodore,\" he said, going after him. \"Do you know where I can fill my\ncanteen?\"\nTheodore whirled and grabbed Stanley by his collar. \"My name's not Thee-o-dore,\"\nhe said. \"It's Armpit.\" He threw Stanley to the ground.\nStanley stared up at him, terrified.\n\"There's a water spigot on the wall of the shower stall.\"\n\"Thanks . . . Armpit,\" said Stanley.\nAs he watched the boy turn and walk away, he couldn't for the life of him figure out\nwhy anyone would want to be called Armpit.\nIn a way, it made him feel a little better about having to sleep in a cot that had been\nused by somebody named Barf Bag. Maybe it was a term of respect.\n\n6\nStanley took a shower\u2014 if you could call it that, ate dinner\u2014 if you could call it that,\nand went to bed\u2014 if you could call his smelly and scratchy cot a bed.\nBecause of the scarcity of water, each camper was only allowed a four-minute\nshower. It took Stanley nearly that long to get used to the cold water. There was no\nknob for hot water. He kept stepping into, then jumping back from, the spray, until the\nwater shut off automatically. He never managed to use his bar of soap, which was just\nas well, because he wouldn't have had time to rinse off the suds.\nDinner was some kind of stewed meat and vegetables. The meat was brown and the\nvegetables had once been green. Everything tasted pretty much the same. He ate it all,\nand used his slice of white bread to mop up the juice. Stanley had never been one to\nleave food on his plate, no matter how it tasted.\n\"What'd you do?\" one of the campers asked him.\nAt first Stanley didn't know what he meant.\n\"They sent you here for a reason.\"\n\"Oh,\" he realized. \"I stole a pair of sneakers.\"\nThe other boys thought that was funny. Stanley wasn't sure why. Maybe because\ntheir crimes were a lot worse than stealing shoes.\n\"From a store, or-were they on someone's feet?\" asked Squid.\n\n10\n\n\"Uh, neither,\" Stanley answered. \"They belonged to Clyde Livingston.\"\nNobody believed him.\n\"Sweet Feet?\" said X-Ray. \"Yeah, right!\"\n\"No way,\" said Squid.\nNow, as Stanley lay on his cot, he thought it was kind of funny in a way. Nobody\nhad believed him when he said he was innocent. Now, when he said he stole them,\nnobody believed him either.\nClyde \"Sweet Feet\" Livingston was a famous baseball player. He'd led the\nAmerican League in stolen bases over the last three years. He was also the only player\nin history to ever hit four triples in one game.\nStanley had a poster of him hanging on the wall of his bedroom. He used to have the\nposter anyway. He didn't know where it was now. It had been taken by the police and\nwas used as evidence of his guilt in the courtroom.\nClyde Livingston also came to court. In spite of everything, when Stanley found out\nthat Sweet Feet was going to be there, he was actually excited about the prospect of\nmeeting his hero.\nClyde Livingston testified that they were his sneakers and that he had donated them\nto help raise money for the homeless shelter. He said he couldn't imagine what kind of\nhorrible person would steal from homeless children.\nThat was the worst part for Stanley. His hero thought he was a no-good-dirty-rotten\nthief.\nAs Stanley tried to turn over on his cot, he was afraid it was going to collapse under\nall his weight. He barely fit in it. When he finally managed to roll over on his stomach,\nthe smell was so bad that he had to turn over again and try sleeping on his back. The cot\nsmelled like sour milk.\nThough it was night, the air was still very warm. Armpit was snoring two cots away.\nBack at school, a bully named Derrick Dunne used to torment Stanley. The teachers\nnever took Stanley's complaints seriously, because Derrick was so much smaller than\nStanley. Some teachers even seemed to find it amusing that a little kid like Derrick\ncould pick on someone as big as Stanley.\nOn the day Stanley was arrested, Derrick had taken Stanley's notebook and, after a\nlong game of come-and-get-it, finally dropped it in the toilet in the boys' restroom. By\nthe time Stanley retrieved it, he had missed his bus and had to walk home.\nIt was while he was walking home, carrying his wet notebook, with the prospect of\nhaving to copy the ruined pages, that the sneakers fell from the sky.\n\"I was walking home and the sneakers fell from the sky,\" he had told the judge.\n\"One hit me on the head.\"\nIt had hurt, too.\nThey hadn't exactly fallen from the sky. He had just walked out from under a\nfreeway overpass when the shoe hit him on the head.\n\n11\nStanley took it as some kind of sign. His father had been trying to figure out a way\nto recycle old sneakers, and suddenly a pair of sneakers fell on top of him, seemingly\nout of nowhere, like a gift from God.\nNaturally, he had no way of knowing they belonged to Clyde Livingston. In fact,\nthe shoes were anything but sweet. Whoever had worn them had had a bad case of foot\nodor.\nStanley couldn't help but think that there was something special about the shoes,\nthat they would somehow provide the key to his father's invention. It was too much of a\ncoincidence to be a mere accident. Stanley had felt like he was holding destiny's shoes.\nHe ran. Thinking back now, he wasn't sure why he ran. Maybe he was in a hurry to\nbring the shoes to his father, or maybe he was trying to run away from his miserable and\nhumiliating day at school.\nA patrol car pulled alongside him. A policeman asked him why he was running.\nThen he took the shoes and made a call on his radio. Shortly thereafter, Stanley was\narrested.\nIt turned out the sneakers had been stolen from a display at the homeless shelter.\nThat evening rich people were going to come to the shelter and pay a hundred dollars to\neat the food that the poor people ate every day for free. Clyde Livingston, who had once\nlived at the shelter when he was younger, was going to speak and sign autographs. His\nshoes would be auctioned, and it was expected that they would sell for over five\nthousand dollars. All the money would go to help the homeless.\nBecause of the baseball schedule, Stanley's trial was delayed several months. His\nparents couldn't afford a lawyer. \"You don't need a lawyer,\" his mother had said. \"Just\ntell the truth.\"\nStanley told the truth, but perhaps it would have been better if he had lied a little. He\ncould have said he found the shoes in the street. No one believed they fell from the sky.\nIt wasn't destiny, he realized. It was his\nno-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather!\nThe judge called Stanley's crime despicable. \"The shoes were valued at over five\nthousand dollars. It was money that would provide food and shelter for the homeless.\nAnd you stole that from them, just so you could have a souvenir.\"\nThe judge said that there was an opening at Camp Green Lake, and he suggested\nthat the discipline of the camp might improve Stanley's character. It was either that or\njail. Stanley's parents asked if they could have some time to find out more about Camp\nGreen Lake, but the judge advised them to make a quick decision. \"Vacancies don't last\nlong at Camp Green Lake.\"\n\n7\nThe shovel felt heavy in Stanley's soft, fleshy hands. He tried to jam it into the earth,\nbut the blade banged against the ground and bounced off without making a dent. The\nvibrations ran up the shaft of the shovel and into Stanley's wrists, making his bones\nrattle.\n\n12\nIt was still dark. The only light came from the moon and the stars, more stars than\nStanley had ever seen before. It seemed he had only just gotten to sleep when Mr.\nPendanski came in and woke everyone up.\nUsing all his might, he brought the shovel back down onto the dry lake bed. The\nforce stung his hands but made no impression on the earth. He wondered if he had a\ndefective shovel. He glanced at Zero, about fifteen feet away, who scooped out a\nshovelful of dirt and dumped it on a pile that was already almost a foot tall.\nFor breakfast they'd been served some kind of lukewarm cereal. The best part was\nthe orange juice. They each got a pint carton. The cereal actually didn't taste too bad,\nbut it had smelled just like his cot.\nThen they filled their canteens, got their shovels, and were marched out across the\nlake. Each group was assigned a different area.\nThe shovels were kept in a shed near the showers. They all looked the same to\nStanley, although X-Ray had his own special shovel, which no one else was allowed to\nuse. X-Ray claimed it was shorter than the others, but if it was, it was only by a fraction\nof an inch.\nThe shovels were five feet long, from the tip of the steel blade to the end of the\nwooden shaft. Stanley's hole would have to be as deep as his shovel, and he'd have to be\nable to lay the shovel flat across the bottom in any direction. That was why X-Ray\nwanted the shortest shovel.\nThe lake was so full of holes and mounds that it reminded Stanley of pictures he'd\nseen of the moon. \"If you find anything interesting or unusual,\" Mr. Pendanski had told\nhim, \"you should report it either to me or Mr. Sir when we come around with the water\ntruck. If the Warden likes what you found, you'll get the rest of the day off.\"\n\"What are we supposed to be looking for?\" Stanley asked him.\n\"You're not looking for anything. You're digging to build character. It's just if you\nfind anything, the Warden would like to know about it.\"\nHe glanced helplessly at his shovel. It wasn't defective. He was defective.\nHe noticed a thin crack in the ground. He placed the point of his shovel on top of it,\nthen jumped on the back of the blade with both feet.\nThe shovel sank a few inches into the packed earth.\nHe smiled. For once in his life it paid to be overweight.\nHe leaned on the shaft and pried up his first shovelful of dirt, then dumped it off to\nthe side.\nOnly ten million more to go, he thought, then placed the shovel back in the crack\nand jumped on it again.\nHe unearthed several shovelfuls of dirt in this manner, before it occurred to him that\nhe was dumping his dirt within the perimeter of his hole. He laid his shovel flat on the\nground and marked where the edges of his hole would be. Five feet was awfully wide.\nHe moved the dirt he'd already dug up out past his mark. He took a drink from his\ncanteen. Five feet would be awfully deep, too.\nThe digging got easier after a while. The ground was hardest at the surface, where\nthe sun had baked a crust about eight inches deep. Beneath that, the earth was looser.\n\n13\nBut by the time Stanley broke past the crust, a blister had formed in the middle of his\nright thumb, and it hurt to hold the shovel.\nStanley's great-great-grandfather was named Elya Yelnats. He was born in Latvia.\nWhen he was fifteen years old he fell in love with Myra Menke.\n(He didn't know he was Stanley's great-great-grandfather.)\nMyra Menke was fourteen. She would turn fifteen in two months, at which time her\nfather had decided she should be married.\nElya went to her father to ask for her hand, but so did Igor Barkov, the pig farmer.\nIgor was fifty-seven years old. He had a red nose and fat puffy cheeks.\n\"I will trade you my fattest pig for your daughter,\" Igor offered.\n\"And what have you got?\" Myra's father asked Elya.\n\"A heart full of love,\" said Elya.\n\"I'd rather have a fat pig,\" said Myra's father.\nDesperate, Elya went to see Madame Zeroni, an old Egyptian woman who lived on\nthe edge of town. He had become friends with her, though she was quite a bit older than\nhim. She was even older than Igor Barkov.\nThe other boys of his village liked to mud wrestle. Elya preferred visiting Madame\nZeroni and listening to her many stories.\nMadame Zeroni had dark skin and a very wide mouth. When she looked at you, her\neyes seemed to expand, and you felt like she was looking right through you.\n\"Elya, what's wrong?\" she asked, before he even told her he was upset. She was\nsitting in a homemade wheelchair. She had no left foot. Her leg stopped at her ankle.\n\"I'm in love with Myra Menke,\" Elya confessed. \"But Igor Barkov has offered to\ntrade his fattest pig for her. I can't compete with that.\"\n\"Good,\" said Madame Zeroni. \"You're too young to get married. You've got your\nwhole life ahead of you.\"\n\"But I love Myra.\"\n\"Myra's head is as empty as a flowerpot.\"\n\"But she's beautiful.\"\n\"So is a flowerpot. Can she push a plow? Can she milk a goat? No, she is too\ndelicate. Can she have an intelligent conversation? No, she is silly and foolish. Will she\ntake care of you when you are sick? No, she is spoiled and will only want you to take\ncare of her. So, she is beautiful. So what? Ptuui!\"\nMadame Zeroni spat on the dirt.\nShe told Elya that he should go to America. \"Like my son. That's where your future\nlies. Not with Myra Menke.\"\nBut Elya would hear none of that. He was fifteen, and all he could see was Myra's\nshallow beauty.\nMadame Zeroni hated to see Elya so forlorn. Against her better judgment, she\nagreed to help him.\n\"It just so happens, my sow gave birth to a litter of piglets yesterday,\" she said.\n\"There is one little runt whom she won't suckle. You may have him. He would die\nanyway.\"\n\n14\nMadame Zeroni led Elya around the back of her house where she kept her pigs.\nElya took the tiny piglet, but he didn't see what good it would do him. It wasn't\nmuch bigger than a rat.\n\"He'll grow,\" Madame Zeroni assured him. \"Do you see that mountain on the edge\nof the forest?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Elya.\n\"On the top of the mountain there is a stream where the water runs uphill. You must\ncarry the piglet every day to the top of the mountain and let it drink from the stream. As\nit drinks, you are to sing to him.\"\nShe taught Elya a special song to sing to the pig.\n\"On the day of Myra's fifteenth birthday, you should carry the pig up the mountain\nfor the last time. Then take it directly to Myra's father. It will be fatter than any of Igor's\npigs.\"\n\"If it is that big and fat,\" asked Elya, \"how will I be able to carry it up the\nmountain?\"\n\"The piglet is not too heavy for you now, is it?\" asked Madame Zeroni.\n\"Of course not,\" said Elya.\n\"Do you think it will be too heavy for you tomorrow?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Every day you will carry the pig up the mountain. It will get a little bigger, but you\nwill get a little stronger. After you give the pig to Myra's father, I want you to do one\nmore thing for me.\"\n\"Anything,\" said Elya.\n\"I want you to carry me up the mountain. I want to drink from the stream, and I want\nyou to sing the song to me.\"\nElya promised he would.\nMadame Zeroni warned that if he failed to do this, he and his descendants would be\ndoomed for all of eternity.\nAt the time, Elya thought nothing of the curse. He was just a fifteen-year-old kid,\nand \"eternity\" didn't seem much longer than a week from Tuesday. Besides, he liked\nMadame Zeroni and would be glad to carry her up the mountain. He would have done it\nright then and there, but he wasn't yet strong enough.\nStanley was still digging. His hole was about three feet deep, but only in the center.\nIt sloped upward to the edges. The sun had only just come up over the horizon, but he\nalready could feel its hot rays against his face.\nAs he reached down to pick up his canteen, he felt a sudden rush of dizziness and\nput his hands on his knees to steady himself. For a moment he was afraid he would\nthrow up, but the moment passed. He drank the last drop of water from his canteen. He\nhad blisters on every one of his fingers, and one in the center of each palm.\nEveryone else's hole was a lot deeper than his. He couldn't actually see their holes\nbut could tell by the size of their dirt piles.\n\n15\nHe saw a cloud of dust moving across the wasteland and noticed that the other boys\nhad stopped digging and were watching it, too. The dirt cloud moved closer, and he\ncould see that it trailed behind a red pickup truck.\nThe truck stopped near where they were digging, and the boys lined up behind it,\nX-Ray in front, Zero at the rear. Stanley got in line behind Zero.\nMr. Sir filled each of their canteens from a tank of water in the bed of the pickup. As\nhe took Stanley's canteen from him, he said, \"This isn't the Girl Scouts, is it?\"\nStanley raised and lowered one shoulder.\nMr. Sir followed Stanley back to his hole to see how he was doing. \"You better get\nwith it,\" he said. \"Or else you're going to be digging in the hottest part of the day.\" He\npopped some sunflower seeds into his mouth, deftly removed the shells with his teeth,\nand spat them into Stanley's hole.\nEvery day Elya carried the little piglet up the mountain and sang to it as it drank\nfrom the stream. As the pig grew fatter, Elya grew stronger.\nOn the day of Myra's fifteenth birthday, Elya's pig weighed over fifty stones.\nMadame Zeroni had told him to carry the pig up the mountain on that day as well, but\nElya didn't want to present himself to Myra smelling like a pig.\nInstead, he took a bath. It was his second bath in less than a week.\nThen he led the pig to Myra's.\nIgor Barkov was there with his pig as well.\n\"These are two of the finest pigs I've ever seen,\" Myra's father declared.\nHe was also impressed with Elya, who seemed to have grown bigger and stronger in\nthe last two months. \"I used to think you were a good-for-nothing book reader,\" he said.\n\"But I see now you could be an excellent mud wrestler.\"\n\"May I marry your daughter?\" Elya boldly asked.\n\"First, I must weigh the pigs.\"\nAlas, poor Elya should have carried his pig up the mountain one last time. The two\npigs weighed exactly the same.\nStanley's blisters had ripped open, and new blisters formed. He kept changing his\ngrip on the shovel to try to avoid the pain. Finally, he removed his cap and held it\nbetween the shaft of his shovel and his raw hands. This helped, but digging was harder\nbecause the cap would slip and slide. The sun beat down on his unprotected head and\nneck.\nThough he tried to convince himself otherwise, he'd been aware for a while that his\npiles of dirt were too close to his hole. The piles were outside his five-foot circle, but he\ncould see he was going to run out of room. Still, he pretended otherwise and kept\nadding more dirt to the piles, piles that he would eventually have to move.\nThe problem was that when the dirt was in the ground, it was compacted. It\nexpanded when it was excavated. The piles were a lot bigger than his hole was deep.\nIt was either now or later. Reluctantly, he climbed up out of his hole, and once again\ndug his shovel into his previously dug dirt.\n\n16\nMyra's father got down on his hands and knees and closely examined each pig, tail\nto snout.\n\"Those are two of the finest pigs I have ever seen,\" he said at last. \"How am I to\ndecide? I have only one daughter.\"\n\"Why not let Myra decide?\" suggested Elya.\n\"That's preposterous!\" exclaimed Igor, expelling saliva as he spoke.\n\"Myra is just an empty-headed girl,\" said her father. \"How can she possibly decide,\nwhen I, her father, can't?\"\n\"She knows how she feels in her heart,\" said Elya.\nMyra's father rubbed his chin. Then he laughed and said, \"Why not?\" He slapped\nElya on the back. \"It doesn't matter to me. A pig is a pig.\"\nHe summoned his daughter.\nElya blushed when Myra entered the room. \"Good afternoon, Myra,\" he said.\nShe looked at him. \"You're Elya, right?\" she asked.\n\"Myra,\" said her father. \"Elya and Igor have each offered a pig for your hand in\nmarriage. It doesn't matter to me. A pig is a pig. So I will let you make the choice.\nWhom do you wish to marry?\"\nMyra looked confused. \"You want me to decide?\"\n\"That's right, my blossom,\" said her father.\n\"Gee, I don't know,\" said Myra. \"Which pig weighs more?\"\n\"They both weigh the same,\" said her father.\n\"Golly,\" said Myra, \"I guess I choose Elya\u2014 No, Igor. No, Elya. No, Igor. Oh, I\nknow! I'll think of a number between one and ten. I'll marry whoever guesses the closest\nnumber. Okay, I'm ready.\"\n\"Ten,\" guessed Igor.\nElya said nothing.\n\"Elya?\" said Myra. \"What number do you guess?\"\nElya didn't pick a number. \"Marry Igor,\" he muttered. \"You can keep my pig as a\nwedding present.\"\nThe next time the water truck came it was driven by Mr. Pendanski, who also\nbrought sack lunches. Stanley sat with his back against a pile of dirt and ate. He had a\nbaloney sandwich, potato chips, and a large chocolate-chip cookie.\n\"How you doin'?\" asked Magnet.\n\"Not real good,\" said Stanley.\n\"Well, the first hole's the hardest,\" Magnet said.\nStanley took a long, deep breath. He couldn't afford to dawdle. He was way behind\nthe others, and the sun just kept getting hotter. It wasn't even noon yet. But he didn't\nknow if he had the strength to stand up.\nHe thought about quitting. He wondered what they would do to him. What could\nthey do to him?\nHis clothes were soaked with sweat. In school he had learned that sweating was\ngood for you. It was nature's way of keeping you cool. So why was he so hot?\nUsing his shovel for support, he managed to get to his feet.\n\n17\n\n\"Where are we supposed to go to the bathroom?\" he asked Magnet.\nMagnet gestured with his arms to the great expanse around them. \"Pick a hole, any\nhole,\" he said.\nStanley staggered across the lake, almost falling over a dirt pile.\nBehind him he heard Magnet say, \"But first make sure nothing's living in it.\"\nAfter leaving Myra's house, Elya wandered aimlessly through the town, until he\nfound himself down by the wharf. He sat on the edge of a pier and stared down into the\ncold, black water. He could not understand how Myra had trouble deciding between\nhim and Igor. He thought she loved him. Even if she didn't love him, couldn't she see\nwhat a foul person Igor was?\nIt was like Madame Zeroni had said. Her head was as empty as a flowerpot.\nSome men were gathering on another dock, and he went to see what was going on.\nA sign read:\nDECK HANDS WANTED\nFREE PASSAGE TO AMERICA\nHe had no sailing experience, but the ship's captain signed him aboard. The captain\ncould see that Elya was a ma n of great strength. Not everybody could carry a full-grown\npig up the side of a mountain.\nIt wasn't until the ship had cleared the harbor and was heading out across the\nAtlantic that he suddenly remembered his promise to carry Madame Zeroni up the\nmountain. He felt terrible.\nHe wasn't afraid of the curse. He thought that was a lot of nonsense. He felt bad\nbecause he knew Madame Zeroni had wanted to drink from the stream before she died.\nZero was the smallest kid in Group D, but he was the first one to finish digging.\n\"You're finished?\" Stanley asked enviously.\nZero said nothing.\nStanley walked to Zero's hole and watched him measure it with his shovel. The top\nof his hole was a perfect circle, and the sides were smooth and steep. Not one dirt clod\nmore than necessary had been removed from the earth.\nZero pulled himself up to the surface. He didn't even smile. He looked down at his\nperfectly dug hole, spat in it, then turned and headed back to the camp compound.\n\"Zero's one weird dude,\" said Zigzag.\nStanley would have laughed, but he didn't have the strength. Zigzag had to be the\n\"weirdest dude\" Stanley had ever seen. He had a long skinny neck, and a big round head\nwith wild frizzy blond hair that stuck out in all directions. His head seemed to bob up\nand down on his neck, like it was on a spring.\nArmpit was the second one to finish digging. He also spat into his hole before\nheading back to the camp compound. One by one, Stanley watched each of the boys spit\ninto his hole and return to the camp compound.\n\n18\nStanley kept digging. His hole was almost up to his shoulders, although it was hard\nto tell exactly where ground level was because his dirt piles completely surrounded the\nhole. The deeper he got, the harder it was to raise the dirt up and out of the hole. Once\nagain, he realized, he was going to have to move the piles.\nHis cap was stained with blood from his hands. He felt like he was digging his own\ngrave.\nIn America, Elya learned to speak English. He fell in love with a woman named\nSarah Miller. She could push a plow, milk a goat, and, most important, think for herself.\nShe and Elya often stayed up half the night talking and laughing together.\nTheir life was not easy. Elya worked hard, but bad luck seemed to follow him\neverywhere. He always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nHe remembered Madame Zeroni telling him that she had a son in America. Elya\nwas forever looking for him. He'd walk up to complete strangers and ask if they knew\nsomeone named Zeroni, or had ever heard of anyone named Zeroni.\nNo one did. Elya wasn't sure what he'd do if he ever found Madame Zeroni's son\nanyway. Carry him up a mountain and sing the pig lullaby to him?\nAfter his barn was struck by lightning for the third time, he told Sarah about his\nbroken promise to Madame Zeroni. \"I'm worse than a pig thief,\" he said. \"You should\nleave me and find someone who isn't cursed.\"\n\"I'm not leaving you,\" said Sarah. \"But I want you to do one thing for me.\"\n\"Anything,\" said Elya.\nSarah smiled. \"Sing me the pig lullaby.\"\nHe sang it for her.\nHer eyes sparkled. \"That's so pretty. What does it mean?\"\nElya tried his best to translate it from Latvian into English, but it wasn't the same.\n\"It rhymes in Latvian,\" he told her.\n\"I could tell,\" said Sarah.\nA year later their child was born. Sarah named him Stanley because she noticed that\n\"Stanley\" was \"Yelnats\" spelled backward.\nSarah changed the words of the pig lullaby so that they rhymed, and every night she\nsang it to little Stanley.\n\"If only, if only,\" the woodpecker sighs,\n\"The bark on the tree was as soft as the skies.\"\nWhile the wolf waits below, hungry and lonely,\nCrying to the moo\u2014 oo\u2014 oon,\n\"If only, if only.\"\nStanley's hole was as deep as his shovel, but not quite wide enough on the bottom.\nHe grimaced as he sliced off a chunk of dirt, then raised it up and flung it onto a pile.\nHe laid his shovel back down on the bottom of his hole and, to his surprise, it fit. He\nrotated it and only had to chip off a few chunks of dirt, here and there, before it could lie\nflat across his hole in every direction.\n\n19\nHe heard the water truck approaching, and felt a strange sense of pride at being able\nto show Mr. Sir, or Mr. Pendanski, that he had dug his first hole.\nHe put his hands on the rim and tried to pull himself up.\nHe couldn't do it. His arms were too weak to lift his heavy body.\nHe used his legs to help, but he just didn't have any strength. He was trapped in his\nhole. It was almost funny, but he wasn't in the mood to laugh.\n\"Stanley!\" he heard Mr. Pendanski call.\nUsing his shovel, he dug two footholds in the hole wall. He climbed out to see Mr.\nPendanski walking over to him.\n\"I was afraid you'd fainted,\" Mr. Pendanski said. \"You wouldn't have been the\nfirst.\"\n\"I'm finished,\" Stanley said, putting his blood-spotted cap back on his head.\n\"All right!\" said Mr. Pendanski, raising his hand for a high five, but Stanley ignored\nit. He didn't have the strength.\nMr. Pendanski lowered his hand and looked down at Stanley's hole. \"Well done,\" he\nsaid. \"You want a ride back?\"\nStanley shook his head. \"I'll walk.\"\nMr. Pendanski climbed back into the truck without filling Stanley's canteen. Stanley\nwaited for him to drive away, then took another look at his hole. He knew it was\nnothing to be proud of, but he felt proud nonetheless.\nHe sucked up his last bit of saliva and spat.\n\n8\nA lot of people don't believe in curses.\nA lot of people don't believe in yellow-spotted lizards either, but if one bites you, it\ndoesn't make a difference whether you believe in it or not.\nActually, it is kind of odd that scientists named the lizard after its yellow spots.\nEach lizard has exactly eleven yellow spots, but the spots are hard to see on its\nyellow-green body.\nThe lizard is from six to ten inches long and has big red eyes. In truth, its eyes are\nyellow, and it is the skin around the eyes which is red, but everyone always speaks of its\nred eyes. It also has black teeth and a milky white tongue.\nLooking at one, you would have thought that it should have been named a\n\"red-eyed\" lizard, or a \"black-toothed\" lizard, or perhaps a \"white-tongued\" lizard.\nIf you've ever been close enough to see the yellow spots, you are probably dead.\nThe yellow-spotted lizards like to live in holes, which offer shade from the sun and\nprotection from predatory birds. Up to twenty lizards may live in one hole. They have\nstrong, powerful legs, and can leap out of very deep holes to attack their prey. They eat\nsmall animals, insects, certain cactus thorns, and the shells of sunflower seeds.\n\n9\n\n20\nStanley stood in the shower and let the cold water pour over his hot and sore body. It\nwas four minutes of heaven. For the second day in a row he didn't use soap. He was too\ntired.\nThere was no roof over the shower building, and the walls were raised up six inches\noff the ground except in the corners. There was no drain in the floor. The water ran out\nunder the walls and evaporated quickly in the sun.\nHe put on his clean set of orange clothes. He returned to his tent, put his duty\nclothes in his crate, got out his pen and box of stationery, and headed to the rec room.\nA sign on the door said WRECK ROOM.\nNearly everything in the room was broken; the TV, the pinball machine, the\nfurniture. Even the people looked broken, with their worn-out bodies sprawled over the\nvarious chairs and sofas.\nX-Ray and Armpit were playing pool. The surface of the table reminded Stanley of\nthe surface of the lake. It was full of bumps and holes because so many people had\ncarved their initials into the felt.\nThere was a hole in the far wall, and an electric fan had been placed in front of it.\nCheap air-conditioning. At least the fan worked.\nAs Stanley made his way across the room, he tripped over an outstretched leg.\n\"Hey, watch it!\" said an orange lump on a chair.\n\"You watch it,\" muttered Stanley, too tired to care.\n\"What'd you say?\" the Lump demanded.\n\"Nothin',\" said Stanley.\nThe Lump rose. He was almost as big as Stanley and a lot tougher. \"You said\nsomething.\" He poked his fat finger in Stanley's neck. \"What'd you say?\"\nA crowd quickly formed around them.\n\"Be cool,\" said X-Ray. He put his hand on Stanley's shoulder. \"You don't want to\nmess with the Caveman,\" he warned.\n\"The Caveman's cool,\" said Armpit.\n\"I'm not looking for trouble,\" Stanley said. \"I'm just tired, that's all.\"\nThe Lump grunted.\nX-Ray and Armpit led Stanley over to a couch. Squid slid over to make room as\nStanley sat down.\n\"Did you see the Caveman back there?\" X-Ray asked.\n\"The Caveman's one tough dude,\" said Squid, and he lightly punched Stanley's arm.\nStanley leaned back against the torn vinyl upholstery. Despite his shower, his body\nstill radiated heat. \"I wasn't trying to start anything,\" he said.\nThe last thing he wanted to do after killing himself all day on the lake was to get in\na fight with a boy called the Caveman. He was glad X-Ray and Armpit had come to his\nrescue.\n\"Well, how'd you like your first hole?\" asked Squid.\nStanley groaned, and the other boys laughed.\n\"Well, the first hole's the hardest,\" said Stanley.\n\n21\n\"No way,\" said X-Ray. \"The second hole's a lot harder. You're hurting before you\neven get started. If you think you're sore now, just wait and see how you feel tomorrow\nmorning, right?\"\n\"That's right,\" said Squid.\n\"Plus, the fun's gone,\" said X-Ray.\n\"The fun?\" asked Stanley.\n\"Don't lie to me,\" said X-Ray. \"I bet you always wanted to dig a big hole, right? Am\nI right?\"\nStanley had never really thought about it before, but he knew better than to tell\nX-Ray he wasn't right.\n\"Every kid in the world wants to dig a great big hole,\" said X-Ray. \"To China,\nright?\"\n\"Right,\" said Stanley.\n\"See what I mean,\" said X-Ray. \"That's what I'm saying. But now the fun's gone.\nAnd you still got to do it again, and again, and again.\"\n\"Camp Fun and Games,\" said Stanley.\n\"What's in the box?\" asked Squid.\nStanley had forgotten he had brought it. \"Uh, paper. I was going to write a letter to\nmy mother.\"\n\"Your mother?\" laughed Squid.\n\"She'll worry if I don't.\"\nSquid scowled.\nStanley looked around the room. This was the one place in camp where the boys\ncould enjoy themselves, and what'd they do? They wrecked it. The glass on the TV was\nsmashed, as if someone had put his foot through it. Every table and chair seemed to be\nmissing at least one leg. Everything leaned.\nHe waited to write the letter until after Squid had gotten up and joined the game of\npool.\nDear Mom,\nToday was my first day at camp, and I've already made some friends. We've been\nout on the lake all day, so I'm pretty tired. Once I pass the swimming test, I'll get to learn\nhow to water-ski. I\nHe stopped writing as he became aware that somebody was reading over his\nshoulder. He turned to see Zero, standing behind the couch.\n\"I don't want her to worry about me,\" he explained.\nZero said nothing. He just stared at the letter with a serious, almost angry look on\nhis face.\nStanley slipped it back into the stationery box.\n\"Did the shoes have red X's on the back?\" Zero asked him.\nIt took Stanley a moment, but then he realized Zero was asking about Clyde\nLivingston's shoes.\n\n22\n\"Yes, they did,\" he said. He wondered how Zero knew that. Brand X was a popular\nbrand of sneakers. Maybe Clyde Livingston made a commercial for them.\nZero stared at him for a moment, with the same intensity with which he had been\nstaring at the letter.\nStanley poked his finger through a hole in the vinyl couch and pulled out some of\nthe stuffing. He wasn't aware of what he was doing.\n\"C'mon, Caveman, dinner,\" said Armpit.\n\"You coming, Caveman?\" said Squid.\nStanley looked around to see that Armpit and Squid were talking to him. \"Uh, sure,\"\nhe said. He put the piece of stationery back in the box, then got up and followed the\nboys out to the tables.\nThe Lump wasn't the Caveman. He was.\nHe shrugged his left shoulder. It was better than Barf Bag.\n\n10\nStanley had no trouble falling asleep, but morning came much too quickly. Every\nmuscle and joint in his body ached as he tried to get out of bed. He didn't think it was\npossible but his body hurt more than it had the day before. It wasn't just his arms and\nback, but his legs, ankles, and waist also hurt. The only thing that got him out of bed\nwas knowing that every second he wasted meant he was one second closer to the rising\nof the sun. He hated the sun.\nHe could hardly lift his spoon during breakfast, and then he was out on the lake, his\nspoon replaced by a shovel. He found a crack in the ground, and began his second hole.\nHe stepped on the shovel blade, and pushed on the very back of the shaft with the\nbase of his thumb. This hurt less than trying to hold the shaft with his blistered fingers.\nAs he dug, he was careful to dump the dirt far away from the hole. He needed to\nsave the area around the hole for when his hole was much deeper.\nHe didn't know if he'd ever get that far. X-Ray was right. The second hole was the\nhardest. It would take a miracle.\nAs long as the sun wasn't out yet, he removed his cap and used it to help protect his\nhands. Once the sun rose, he would have to put it back on his head. His neck and\nforehead had been badly burned the day before.\nHe took it one shovelful at a time, and tried not to think of the awesome task that lay\nahead of him. After an hour or so, his sore muscles seemed to loosen up a little bit.\nHe grunted as he tried to stick his shovel into the dirt. His cap slipped out from\nunder his fingers, and the shovel fell free.\nHe let it lie there.\nHe took a drink from his canteen. He guessed that the water truck should be coming\nsoon, but he didn't finish all the water, just in case he was wrong. He'd learned to wait\nuntil he saw the truck, before drinking the last drop.\nThe sun wasn't yet up, but its rays arced over the horizon and brought light to the\nsky.\n\n23\nHe reached down to pick up his cap, and there next to it he saw a wide flat rock. As\nhe put his cap on his head, he continued to look down at the rock.\nHe picked it up. He thought he could see the shape of a fish, fossilized in it.\nHe rubbed off some dirt, and the outline of the fish became clearer. The sun peeked\nover the horizon, and he could actually see tiny lines where every one of the fish's bones\nhad been.\nHe looked at the barren land all around him. True, everyone referred to this area as\n\"the lake,\" but it was still hard to believe that this dry wasteland was once full of water.\nThen he remembered what Mr. Sir and Mr. Pendanski had both said. If he dug up\nanything interesting, he should report it to one of them. If the Warden liked it, he would\nget the rest of the day off.\nHe looked back down at his fish. He'd found his miracle.\nHe continued to dig, though very slowly, as he waited for the water truck. He didn't\nwant to bring attention to his find, afraid that one of the other boys might try to take it\nfrom him. He tossed the rock, face down, beside his dirt pile, as if it had no special\nvalue. A short while later he saw the cloud of dirt heading across the lake.\nThe truck stopped and the boys lined up. They always lined up in the same order,\nStanley realized, no matter who got there first. X-Ray was always at the front of the line.\nThen came Armpit, Squid, Zigzag, Magnet, and Zero.\nStanley got in line behind Zero. He was glad to be at the back, so no one would\nnotice the fossil. His pants had very large pockets, but the rock still made a bulge.\nMr. Pendanski filled each boy's canteen, until Stanley was the only one left.\n\"I found something,\" Stanley said, taking it out of his pocket.\nMr. Pendanski reached for Stanley's canteen, but Stanley handed him the rock\ninstead.\n\"What's this?\"\n\"It's a fossil,\" said Stanley. \"See the fish?\"\nMr. Pendanski looked at it again.\n\"See, you can even see all of its little bones,\" said Stanley.\n\"Interesting,\" said Mr. Pendanski. \"Let me have your canteen.\"\nStanley handed it to him. Mr. Pendanski filled it, then returned it.\n\"So do I get the rest of the day off?\"\n\"What for?\"\n\"You know, you said if I found something interesting, the Warden would give me\nthe day off.\"\nMr. Pendanski laughed as he gave the fossil back to Stanley. \"Sorry, Stanley. The\nWarden isn't interested in fossils.\"\n\"Let me see that,\" said Magnet, taking the rock from Stanley.\nStanley continued to stare at Mr. Pendanski.\n\"Hey, Zig, dig this rock.\"\n\"Cool,\" said Zigzag.\nStanley saw his fossil being passed around.\n\n24\n\"I don't see nothing,\" said X-Ray. He took off his glasses, wiped them on his dirty\nclothes, and put them back on.\n\"See, look at the little fishy,\" said Armpit.\n\n11\nStanley returned to his hole. It wasn't fair. Mr. Pendanski had even said his fossil\nwas interesting. He slammed his shovel into the ground and pried up another piece of\nearth.\nAfter a while, he noticed X-Ray had come by and was watching him dig.\n\"Hey, Caveman, let me talk to you a second,\" X-Ray said.\nStanley put down his shovel and stepped up out of his hole.\n\"Say, listen,\" said X-Ray. \"If you find something else, give it to me, okay?\"\nStanley wasn't sure what to say. X-Ray was clearly the leader of the group, and\nStanley didn't want to get on his bad side.\n\"You're new here, right?\" said X-Ray. \"I've been here for almost a year. I've never\nfound anything. You know, my eyesight's not so good. No one knows this, but you\nknow why my name's X-Ray?\"\nStanley shrugged one shoulder.\n\"It's pig latin for Rex. That's all. I'm too blind to find anything.\"\nStanley tried to remember how pig latin worked.\n\"I mean,\" X-Ray went on, \"why should you get a day off when you've only been\nhere a couple of days? If anybody gets a day off, it should be me. That's only fair,\nright?\"\n\"I guess,\" Stanley agreed.\nX-Ray smiled. \"You're a good guy, Caveman.\"\nStanley picked up his shovel.\nThe more he thought about it, the more he was glad that he agreed to let X-Ray have\nanything he might find. If he was going to survive at Camp Green Lake, it was far more\nimportant that X-Ray think he was a good guy than it was for him to get one day off.\nBesides, he didn't expect to find anything anyway. There probably wasn't anything \"of\ninterest\" out there, and even if there was, he'd never been what you could call lucky.\nHe slammed his blade into the ground, then dumped out another shovelful of dirt. It\nwas a little surprising, he thought, that X-Ray was the leader of the group, since he\nobviously wasn't the biggest or the toughest. In fact, except for Zero, X-Ray was the\nsmallest. Armpit was the biggest. Zigzag may have been taller than Armpit, but that\nwas only because of his neck. Yet Armpit, and all the others, seemed to be willing to do\nwhatever X-Ray asked of them.\nAs Stanley dug up another shovelful of dirt, it occurred to him that Armpit wasn't\nthe biggest. He, the Caveman, was bigger.\nHe was glad they called him Caveman. It meant they accepted him as a member of\nthe group. He would have been glad even if they'd called him Barf Bag.\n\n25\nIt was really quite remarkable to him. At school, bullies like Derrick Dunne used to\npick on him. Yet Derrick Dunne would be scared senseless by any of the boys here.\nAs he dug his hole, Stanley thought about what it would be like if Derrick Dunne\nhad to fight Armpit or Squid. Derrick wouldn't stand a chance.\nHe imagined what it would be like if he became good friends with all of them, and\nthen for some reason they all went with him to his school, and then Derrick Dunne tried\nto steal his notebook . . .\n\"Just what do you think you're doing?\" asks Squid, as he slams his hands into\nDerrick Dunne's smug face.\n\"Caveman's our friend,\" says Armpit, grabbing him by the shin collar.\nStanley played the scene over and over again in his mind, each time watching\nanother boy from Group D beat up Derrick Dunne. It helped him dig his hole and ease\nhis own suffering. Whatever pain he felt was being felt ten times worse by Derrick.\n\n12\nAgain, Stanley was the last one to finish digging. It was late afternoon when he\ndragged himself back to the compound. This time he would have accepted a ride on the\ntruck if it was offered.\nWhen he got to the tent, he found Mr. Pendanski and the other boys sitting in a\ncircle on the ground.\n\"Welcome, Stanley,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\n\"Hey, Caveman. You get your hole dug?\" asked Magnet.\nHe managed to nod.\n\"You spit in it?\" asked Squid.\nHe nodded again. \"You're right,\" he said to X-Ray. \"The second hole's the hardest.\"\nX-Ray shook his head. \"The third hole's the hardest,\" he said.\n\"Come join our circle,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\nStanley plopped down between Squid and Magnet. He needed to rest up before\ntaking a shower.\n\"We've been discussing what we want to do with our lives,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\n\"We're not going to be at Camp Green Lake forever. We need to prepare for the day we\nleave here and join the rest of society.\"\n\"Hey, that's great, Mom!\" said Magnet. \"They're going to finally let you out of\nhere?\"\nThe other boys laughed.\n\"Okay, Jos\u00e9,\" said Mr. Pendanski. \"What do you want to do with your life?\"\n\"I don't know,\" said Magnet.\n\"You need to think about that,\" said Mr. Pendanski. \"It's important to have goals.\nOtherwise you're going to end up right back in jail. What do you like to do?\"\n\"I don't know,\" said Magnet.\n\"You must like something,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\n\"I like animals,\" said Magnet.\n\n26\n\"Good,\" said Mr. Pendanski. \"Does anyone know of any jobs that involve\nanimals?\"\n\"Veterinarian,\" said Armpit.\n\"That's right,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\n\"He could work in a zoo,\" said Zigzag.\n\"He belongs in the zoo,\" said Squid, then he and X-Ray laughed.\n\"How about you, Stanley? Any ideas for Jos\u00e9?\"\nStanley sighed. \"Animal trainer,\" he said. \"Like for the circus, or movies, or\nsomething like that.\"\n\"Any of those jobs sound good to you, Jos\u00e9?\" asked Mr. Pendanski.\n\"Yeah, I like what Caveman said. About training animals for movies. I think it\nwould be fun to train monkeys.\"\nX-Ray laughed.\n\"Don't laugh, Rex,\" said Mr. Pendanski. \"We don't laugh at people's dreams.\nSomeone is going to have to train monkeys for the movies.\"\n\"Who are you kidding, Mom?\" asked X-Ray. \"Magnet's never going to be a\nmonkey trainer.\"\n\"You don't know that,\" said Mr. Pendanski. \"I'm not saying it's going to be easy.\nNothing in life is easy. But that's no reason to give up. You'll be surprised what you can\naccomplish if you set your mind to it. After all, you only have one life, so you should try\nto make the most of it.''\nStanley tried to figure out what he'd say if Mr. Pendanski asked him what he wanted\nto do with his life. He used to think he wanted to work for the F.B.I., but this didn't seem\nthe appropriate place to mention that.\n\"So far you've all done a pretty good job at messing up your lives,\" said Mr.\nPendanski. \"I know you think you're cool.\" He looked at Stanley. \"So you're Caveman,\nnow, huh? You like digging holes, Caveman?\"\nStanley didn't know what to say.\n\"Well, let me tell you something, Caveman. You are here on account of one person.\nIf it wasn't for that person, you wouldn't be here digging holes in the hot sun. You know\nwho that person is?\"\n\"My no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grand-father.\"\nThe other boys howled with laughter.\nEven Zero smiled.\nIt was the first time Stanley had ever seen Zero smile. He usually had such an angry\nexpression on his face. Now he had such a huge smile it almost seemed too big for his\nface, like the smile on a jack-o'-lantern.\n\"No,\" said Mr. Pendanski. \"That person is you, Stanley. You're the reason you are\nhere. You're responsible for yourself. You messed up your life, and it's up to you to fix\nit. No one else is going to do it for you\u2014 for any of you.\"\nMr. Pendanski looked from one boy to another. \"You're all special in your own\nway,\" he said. \"You've all got something to offer. You have to think about what you\nwant to do, then do it. Even you, Zero. You're not completely worthless.\"\nThe smile was now gone from Zero's face.\n\n27\n\n\"What do you want to do with your life?\" Mr. Pendanski asked him.\nZero's mouth was shut tight. As he glared at Mr. Pendanski, his dark eyes seemed to\nexpand.\n\"What about it, Zero?\" asked Mr. Pendanski. \"What do you like to do?\"\n\"I like to dig holes.\"\n\n13\nAll too soon Stanley was back out on the lake, sticking his shovel into the dirt.\nX-Ray was right: the third hole was the hardest. So was the fourth hole. And the fifth\nhole. And the sixth, and the . . .\nHe dug his shovel into the dirt.\nAfter a while he'd lost track of the day of the week, and how many holes he'd dug. It\nall seemed like one big hole, and it would take a year and a half to dig it. He guessed\nhe'd lost at least five pounds. He figured that in a year and a half he'd be either in great\nphysical condition, or else dead.\nHe dug his shovel into the dirt.\nIt couldn't always be this hot, he thought. Surely it got cooler in December. Maybe\nthen they froze.\nHe dug his shovel into the dirt.\nHis skin had gotten tougher. It didn't hurt so much to hold the shovel.\nAs he drank from his canteen he looked up at the sky. A cloud had appeared earlier\nin the day. It was the first cloud he could remember seeing since coming to Camp Green\nLake.\nHe and the other boys had been watching it all day, hoping it would move in front of\nthe sun. Occasionally it got close, but it was just teasing them.\nHis hole was waist deep. He dug his shovel into the dirt. As he dumped it out, he\nthought he saw something glisten as it fell onto the dirt pile. Whatever it was, it was\nquickly buried.\nStanley stared at the pile a moment, unsure if he'd even seen it. Even if it was\nsomething, what good would it do him? He'd promised to give anything he found to\nX-Ray. It didn't seem worth the effort to climb out of his hole to check it out.\nHe glanced up at the cloud, which was close enough to the sun that he had to squint\nto look at it.\nHe dug his shovel back into the earth, scooped out some dirt, and lifted it over his\ndirt pile. But instead of dumping it there, he tossed it off to the side. His curiosity had\ngotten the better of him.\nHe climbed up out of his hole and sifted his fingers through the pile. He felt\nsomething hard and metallic.\nHe pulled it out. It was a gold tube, about as long and as wide as the second finger\non his right hand. The tube was open at one end and closed at the other.\nHe used a few drops of his precious water to clean it.\n\n28\nThere seemed to be some kind of design on the flat, closed end. He poured a few\nmore drops of water on it and rubbed it on the inside of his pants pocket.\nHe looked again at the design engraved into the flat bottom of the tube. He could\nsee an outline of a heart, with the letters K B etched inside it.\nHe tried to figure out some way that he wouldn't have to give it to X-Ray. He could\njust keep it, but that wouldn't do him any good. He wanted a day off.\nHe looked at the large piles of dirt near where X-Ray was digging. X-Ray was\nprobably almost finished for the day. Getting the rest of the day off would hardly do\nhim much good. X-Ray would first have to show the tube to Mr. Sir or Mr. Pendanski,\nwho would then have to show it to the Warden. By then X-Ray might be done anyway.\nStanley wondered about trying to secretly take the tube directly to the Warden. He\ncould explain the situation to the Warden, and the Warden might make up an excuse for\ngiving him the day off, so X-Ray wouldn't suspect.\nHe looked across the lake toward the cabin under the two oak trees. The place\nscared him. He'd been at Camp Green Lake almost two weeks, and he still hadn't seen\nthe Warden. That was just as well. If he could go his entire year and a half without\nseeing the Warden, that would be fine with him.\nBesides, he didn't know if the Warden would find the tube \"interesting.\" He looked\nat it again. It looked familiar. He thought he'd seen something like it, somewhere before,\nbut couldn't quite place it.\n\"What you got there, Caveman?\" asked Zigzag.\nStanley's large hand closed around the tube. \"Nothin', just, uh . . .\" It was useless. \"I\nthink I might have found something.\"\n\"Another fossil?\"\n\"No, I'm not sure what it is.\"\n\"Let me see,\" said Zigzag.\nInstead of showing it to Zigzag, Stanley brought it to X-Ray. Zigzag followed.\nX-Ray looked at the tube, then rubbed his dirty glasses on his dirty shirt and looked\nat the tube again. One by one, the other boys dropped their shovels and came to look.\n\"It looks like an old shotgun shell,\" said Squid.\n\"Yeah, that's probably what it is,\" said Stanley. He decided not to mention the\nengraved design. Maybe nobody would notice it. He doubted X-Ray could see it.\n\"No, it's too long and thin to be a shotgun shell,\" said Magnet.\n\"It's prob'ly just a piece of junk,\" said Stanley.\n\"Well, I'll show it to Mom,\" said X-Ray. \"See what he thinks. Who knows? Maybe\nI'll get the day off.\"\n\"Your hole's almost finished,\" said Stanley.\n\"Yeah, so?\"\nStanley raised and lowered his shoulder. \"So, why don't you wait until tomorrow to\nshow it to Mom?\" he suggested. \"You can pretend you found it first thing in the\nmorning. Then you can get the whole day off, instead of just an hour or so this\nafternoon.\"\nX-Ray smiled. \"Good thinking, Caveman.\" He dropped the tube into his large\npocket on the right leg of his dirty orange pants.\n\n29\n\nStanley returned to his hole.\nWhen the water truck came, Stanley started to take his place at the end of the line,\nbut X-Ray told him to get behind Magnet, in front of Zero.\nStanley moved up one place in line.\n\n14\nThat night, as Stanley lay on his scratchy and smelly cot, he tried to figure out what\nhe could have done differently, but there was nothing he could do. For once in his\nunlucky life, he was in the right place at the right time, and it still didn't help him.\n\"You got it?\" he asked X-Ray the next morning at breakfast.\nX-Ray looked at him with half-opened eyes behind his dirty glasses. \"I don't know\nwhat you're talking about,\" he grumbled.\n\"You know . . .\" said Stanley.\n\"No, I don't know!\" X-Ray snapped. \"So just leave me alone, okay? I don't want to\ntalk to you.\"\nStanley didn't say another word.\nMr. Sir marched the boys out to the lake, chewing sunflower seeds along the way\nand spitting out the shells. He scraped the ground with his boot heel, to mark where\neach boy was supposed to dig.\nStanley stamped down on the back of the blade of the shovel, piercing the hard, dry\nearth. He couldn't figure out why X-Ray snapped at him. If he wasn't going to produce\nthe tube, why did he make Stanley give it to him? Was he just going to keep it? The tube\nwas gold in color, but Stanley didn't think it was real gold.\nThe water truck came a little after sunrise. Stanley finished his last drop of water\nand stepped up out of his hole. At this time of day, Stanley sometimes could see some\ndistant hills or mountains on the other side of the lake. They were only visible for a\nshort while and would soon disappear behind the haze of heat and dirt.\nThe truck stopped, and the dust cloud drifted past it. X-Ray took his place at the\nfront of the line. Mr. Pendanski filled his canteen. \"Thanks, Mom,\" X-Ray said. He\ndidn't mention the tube.\nMr. Pendanski filled all the canteens, then climbed back into the cab of the pickup.\nHe still had to bring water to Group E. Stanley could see them digging about two\nhundred yards away.\n\"Mr. Pendanski!\" X-Ray shouted from his hole. \"Wait! Mr. Pendanski! I think I\nmight have found something!\"\nThe boys all followed Mr. Pendanski as he walked over to X-Ray's hole. Stanley\ncould see the gold tube sticking out of some dirt on the end of X-Ray's shovel.\nMr. Pendanski examined it and took a long look at its flat bottom. \"I think the\nWarden is going to like this.\"\n\"Does X-Ray get the day off?\" asked Squid.\n\"Just keep digging until someone says otherwise,\" Mr. Pendanski said. Then he\nsmiled. \"But if I were you, Rex, I wouldn't dig too hard.\"\n\n30\nStanley watched the cloud of dust move across the lake to the cabin beneath the\ntrees.\nThe boys in Group E were just going to have to wait.\nIt didn't take long for the pickup to return. Mr. Pendanski stepped out of the cab. A\ntall woman with red hair stepped out of the passenger side. She looked even taller than\nshe was, since Stanley was down in his hole. She wore a black cowboy hat and black\ncowboy boots which were studded with turquoise stones. The sleeves on her shirt were\nrolled up, and her arms were covered with freckles, as was her face. She walked right\nup to X-Ray.\n\"This where you found it?\"\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\"Your good work will be rewarded.\" She turned to Mr. Pendanski. \"Drive X-Ray\nback to camp. Let him take a double shower, and give him some clean clothes. But first\nI want you to fill everyone's canteen.\"\n\"I just filled them a little while ago,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\nThe Warden stared hard at him. \"Excuse me,\" she said. Her voice was soft.\n\"I had just filled them when Rex\u2014 \"\n\"Excuse me,\" the Warden said again. \"Did I ask you when you last filled them?\"\n\"No, but it's just\u2014 \"\n\"Excuse me.\"\nMr. Pendanski stopped talking. The Warden wiggled her finger for him to come to\nher. \"It's hot and it's only going to get hotter,\" she said. \"Now, these fine boys have been\nworking hard. Don't you think it might be possible that they might have taken a drink\nsince you last filled their canteens?\"\nMr. Pendanski said nothing.\nThe Warden turned to Stanley. \"Caveman, will you come here, please?\"\nStanley was surprised she knew his name. He had never seen her. Until she stepped\nout of the truck, he didn't even know the Warden was a woman.\nHe nervously went toward her.\n\"Mr. Pendanski and I have been having a discussion. Have you taken a drink since\nMr. Pendanski last filled your canteen?\"\nStanley didn't want to cause any trouble for Mr. Pendanski. \"I still got plenty left,\"\nhe said.\n\"Excuse me.\"\nHe stopped. \"Yeah, I drank some.\"\n\"Thank you. May I see your canteen please.\"\nStanley handed it to her. Her fingernails were painted dark red.\nShe gently shook the canteen, letting the water swish inside the plastic container.\n\"Do you hear the empty spaces?\" she asked.\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\n\"Then fill it,\" she said. \"And the next time I tell you to do something, I expect you to\ndo it without questioning my authority. If it's too much trouble for you to fill a canteen,\nI'll give you a shovel. You can dig the hole, and the Caveman can fill your canteen.\"\n\n31\nShe turned back to Stanley. \"I don't think that would be too much trouble for you,\nwould it?\"\n\"No,\" said Stanley.\n\"So what will it be?\" she asked Mr. Pendanski. \"Do you want to fill the canteens or\ndo you want to dig?\"\n\"I'll fill the canteens,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n15\nMr. Pendanski filled the canteens.\nThe Warden got a pitchfork out of the back of the pickup. She poked it through\nX-Ray's dirt pile, to see if anything else might have been buried in there as well.\n\"After you drop off X-Ray, I want you to bring back three wheelbarrows,\" she said.\nX-Ray got in the pickup. As the truck pulled away, he leaned out the wide window\nand waved.\n\"Zero,\" said the Warden. \"I want you to take over X-Ray's hole.\" She seemed to\nknow that Zero was the fastest digger.\n\"Armpit and Squid, you will keep digging where you have been,\" she said. \"But\nyou're each going to have a helper. Zigzag, you help Armpit. Magnet will help Squid.\nAnd Caveman, you'll work with Zero. We're going to dig the dirt twice. Zero will dig it\nout of the hole, and Caveman will carefully shovel it into a wheelbarrow. Zigzag will do\nthe same for Armpit, and the same with Magnet and Squid. We don't want to miss\nanything. If either of you find something, you'll both get the rest of the day off, and a\ndouble shower.\n\"When the wheelbarrows are full, you are to dump them away from this area. We\ndon't want any dirt piles to get in the way.\"\nThe Warden remained at the site for the remainder of the day, along with Mr.\nPendanski and Mr. Sir, who showed up after a while. Occasionally Mr. Sir would leave\nto take water to the other groups of campers, but otherwise he and the water truck\nstayed parked there. The Warden saw to it that nobody in Group D was ever thirsty.\nStanley did as he was told. He carefully looked through all the dirt dug up by Zero,\nas he shoveled it into a wheelbarrow, though he knew he wouldn't find anything.\nIt was easier than digging his own hole. When the wheelbarrow was full, he took it\na good distance away before dumping it.\nThe Warden couldn't keep still. She kept walking around, looking over the boys'\nshoulders, and sticking her pitchfork through the dirt piles. \"You're doing fine, just\nfine,\" she told Stanley.\nAfter a while, she told the boys to switch places, so that Stanley, Zigzag, and\nMagnet dug in the holes, and Zero, Armpit, and Squid shoveled the excavated dirt into\nthe wheelbarrows.\n\n32\n\nAfter lunch, Zero took over the digging again, and Stanley returned to the\nwheelbarrow. \"There's no hurry,\" the Warden said several times. \"The main thing is not\nto miss anything.\"\nThe boys dug until each hole was well over six feet deep and wide. Still, it was\neasier for two boys to dig a six-foot hole than it was for one boy to dig a five-foot hole.\n\"All right, that's enough for today,\" the Warden said. \"I've waited this long, I can\nwait another day.\"\nMr. Sir drove her back to her cabin.\n\"I wonder how she knew all our names,\" Stanley said as he walked back to the\ncompound.\n\"She watches us all the time,\" said Zigzag. \"She's got hidden microphones and\ncameras all over the place. In the tents, the Wreck Room, the shower.\"\n\"The shower?\" asked Stanley. He wondered if Zigzag was just being paranoid.\n\"The cameras are tiny,\" said Armpit. \"No bigger than the toenail on your little toe.\"\nStanley had his doubts about that. He didn't think they could make cameras that\nsmall. Microphones, maybe.\nHe realized that was why X-Ray didn't want to talk to him about the gold tube at\nbreakfast. X-Ray was afraid the Warden might have been listening.\nOne thing was certain: They weren't just digging to \"build character.\" They were\ndefinitely looking for something.\nAnd whatever they were looking for, they were looking in the wrong place.\nStanley gazed out across the lake, toward the spot where he had been digging\nyesterday when he found the gold tube. He dug the hole into his memory.\n\n16\nAs Stanley entered the Wreck Room, he could hear X-Ray's voice from all the way\nacross the room.\n\"See what I'm saying,\" X-Ray said. \"Am I right, or am I right?\"\nThe other bodies in the room were little more than bags of flesh and bones, dumped\nacross broken chairs and couches. X-Ray was full of life, laughing and waving his arms\naround as he talked. \"Yo, Caveman, my man!\" he called out.\nStanley made his way across the room.\n\"Hey, slide on over, Squid,\" said X-Ray. \"Make room for the Caveman.\"\nStanley crashed on the couch.\nHe had looked for a hidden camera in the shower. He hadn't seen anything, and he\nhoped the Warden hadn't either.\n\"What's the matter?\" asked X-Ray. \"You guys tired or something?\" He laughed.\n\"Hey, keep it down, will you,\" groaned Zigzag. \"I'm trying to watch TV.\"\nStanley glanced uncertainly at Zigzag, who was staring very intently at the busted\ntelevision screen.\n\n33\nThe Warden greeted the boys at breakfast the next morning and went with them to\nthe holes. Four dug in the holes, and three tended to the wheelbarrows. \"Glad you're\nhere, X-Ray,\" she said to him. \"We need your sharp eyes.\"\nStanley spent more time pushing the wheelbarrow than digging, because he was\nsuch a slow digger. He carted away the excess dirt and dumped it into previously dug\nholes. He was careful not to dump any of it in the hole w here the gold tube was actually\nfound.\nHe could still see the tube in his mind. It seemed so familiar, but he just couldn't\nplace it. He thought that it might have been the lid to a fancy gold pen. K B could have\nbeen the initials of a famous author. The only famous authors he could think of were\nCharles Dickens, William Shakespeare, and Mark Twain. Besides, it didn't really look\nlike the top of a pen.\nBy lunchtime the Warden was beginning to lose her patience. She made them eat\nquickly, so they could get back to work. \"If you can't get them to work any faster,\" she\ntold Mr. Sir, \"then you're going to have to climb down there and dig with them.\"\nAfter that, everyone worked faster, especially when Mr. Sir was watching them.\nStanley practically ran when he pushed his wheelbarrow. Mr. Sir reminded them that\nthey weren't Girl Scouts.\nThey didn't quit digging until after every other group had finished.\nLater, as Stanley sat sprawled across an understuffed chair, he tried to think of a\nway to tell the Warden where the tube was really found, without getting himself or\nX-Ray into trouble. It didn't seem possible. He even thought about sneaking out at night\nand digging in that hole by himself. But the last thing he wanted to do after digging all\nday was to \"dig at night, too. Besides, the shovels were locked up at night, presumably\nso they couldn't be used as weapons.\nMr. Pendanski entered the Wreck Room. \"Stanley,\" he called as he made his way to\nhim.\n\"His name's Caveman,\" said X-Ray.\n\"Stanley,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\n\"My name's Caveman,\" said Stanley.\n\"Well, I have a letter here for someone named Stanley Yelnats,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\nHe turned over an envelope in his hands. \"It doesn't say Caveman anywhere.\"\n\"Uh, thanks,\" Stanley said, taking it.\nIt was from his mother.\n\"Who's it from?\" Squid asked. \"Your mother?\"\nStanley put it in the big pocket of his pants.\n\"Aren't you going to read it to us?\" asked Armpit.\n\"Give him some space,\" said X-Ray. \"If Caveman doesn't want to read it to us, he\ndoesn't have to. It's probably from his girlfriend.\"\nStanley smiled.\nHe read it later, after the other boys had gone to dinner.\n\n34\n\nDear Stanley,\nIt was wonderful to hear from you. Your letter made me feel like one of the other\nmoms who can afford to send their kids to summer camp. I know it's not the same, but I\nam very proud of you for trying to make the best of a bad situation. Who knows? Maybe\nsomething good will come of this.\nYour father thinks he is real close to a breakthrough on his sneaker project. I hope\nso. The landlord is threatening to evict us because of the odor.\nI feel sorry for the little old lady who lived in a shoe. It must have smelled awful!\nLove from both of us,\n\"What's so funny?\" Zero asked.\nIt startled him. He thought Zero had gone to dinner with the others.\n\"Nothing. Just something my mom wrote.\"\n\"What'd she say?\" Zero asked.\n\"Nothing.\"\n\"Oh, sorry,\" said Zero.\n\"Well, see my dad is trying to invent a way to recycle old sneakers. So the\napartment kind of smells bad, because he's always cooking these old sneakers. So\nanyway, in the letter my mom said she felt sorry for that little old lady who lived in a\nshoe, you know, because it must have smelled bad in there.\"\nZero stared blankly at him.\n\"You know, the nursery rhyme?\"\nZero said nothing.\n\"You've heard the nursery rhyme about the little old lady who lived in a shoe?\"\n\"No.\"\nStanley was amazed.\n\"How does it go?\" asked Zero.\n\"Didn't you ever watch Sesame Street?\" Stanley asked.\nZero stared blankly.\nStanley headed on to dinner. He would have felt pretty silly reciting nursery rhymes\nat Camp Green Lake.\n\n17\nFor the next week and a half, the boys continued to dig in and around the area where\nX-Ray had supposedly found the gold tube. They widened X-Ray's hole, as well as the\nholes Armpit and Squid had been digging, until the fourth day, when all three holes met\nand formed one big hole.\nAs the days wore on, the Warden became less and less patient. She arrived later in\nthe morning and left earlier in the afternoon. Meanwhile, the boys continued to dig later\nand later.\n\"This is no bigger than it was when I left you yesterday,\" she said after arriving late\none morning, well after sunrise. \"What have you been doing down there?\"\n\n35\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Squid.\nIt was the wrong thing to say.\nAt just that moment, Armpit was returning from a bathroom break.\n\"How nice of you to join us,\" she said. \"And what have you been doing?\"\n\"I had to . . . you know . . . go.\"\nThe Warden jabbed at Armpit with her pitchfork, knocking him backward into the\nbig hole. The pitchfork left three holes in the front of his shirt, and three tiny spots of\nblood.\n\"You're giving these boys too much water,\" the Warden told Mr. Pendanski.\nThey continued to dig until late afternoon, long after all the other groups had\nfinished for the day. Stanley was down in the big hole, along with the other six boys.\nThey had stopped using the wheelbarrows.\nHe dug his shovel into the side of the hole. He scooped up some dirt, and was\nraising it up to the surface when Zigzag's shovel caught him in the side of the head.\nHe collapsed.\nHe wasn't sure if he passed out or not. He looked up to see Zigzag's wild head\nstaring down at him. \"I ain't digging that dirt up,\" Zigzag said. \"That's your dirt.\"\n\"Hey, Mom!\" Magnet called. \"Caveman's been hurt.\"\nStanley brought his fingers up the side of his neck. He felt his wet blood and a pretty\nbig gash just below his ear.\nMagnet helped Stanley to his feet, then up and out of the hole. Mr. Sir made a\nbandage out of a piece of his sack of sunflower seeds and taped it over Stanley's wound.\nThen he told him to get back to work. \"It isn't nap time.\"\nWhen Stanley returned to the hole, Zigzag was waiting for him.\n\"That's your dirt,\" Zigzag said. \"You have to dig it up. It's covering up my dirt.\"\nStanley felt a little dizzy. He could see a small pile of dirt. It took him a moment to\nrealize that it was the dirt which had been on his shovel when he was hit.\nHe scooped it up, then Zigzag dug his shovel into the ground underneath where\n\"Stanley's dirt\" had been.\n\n18\nThe next morning Mr. Sir marched the boys to another section of the lake, and each\nboy dug his own hole, five feet deep and five feet wide. Stanley was glad to be away\nfrom the big hole. At least now he knew just how much he had to dig for the day. And it\nwas a relief not to have other shovels swinging past his face, or the Warden hanging\naround.\nHe dug his shovel into the dirt, then slowly turned to dump it into a pile. He had to\nmake his turns smooth and slow. If he jerked too quickly, he felt a throbbing pain just\nabove his neck where Zigzag's shovel had hit him.\n\n36\nThat part of his head, between his neck and ear, was considerably swollen. There\nwere no mirrors in camp, but he imagined he looked like he had a hard-boiled egg\nsticking out of him.\nThe remainder of his body hardly hurt at all. His muscles had strengthened, and his\nhands were tough and callused. He was still the slowest digger, but not all that much\nslower than Magnet. Less than thirty minutes after Magnet returned to camp, Stanley\nspat into his hole.\nAfter his shower, he put his dirty clothes in his crate and got out his box of\nstationery. He stayed in the tent to write the letter so Squid and the other boys wouldn't\nmake fun of him for writing to his mother.\nDear Mom and Dad,\nCamp is hard, but challenging. We've been running obstacle courses, and have to\nswim long distances on the lake. Tomorrow we learn...\nHe stopped writing as Zero walked into the tent, then returned to his letter. He didn't\ncare what Zero thought. Zero was nobody.\n... to rock climb. I know that sounds scary, but don't worry,\nZero was standing beside him now, watching him write.\nStanley turned, and felt his neck throb. \"I don't like it when you read over my\nshoulder, okay?\"\nZero said nothing.\nI'll be careful. It's not all fun and games here, but I think I'm getting a lot out of it. It\nbuilds character. The other boys...\n\"I don't know how,\" said Zero.\n\"What?\"\n\"Can you teach me?\"\nStanley didn't know what he was talking about. \"Teach you what, to rock climb?\"\nZero stared at him with penetrating eyes.\n\"What?\" said Stanley. He was hot, tired, and sore.\n\"I want to learn to read and write,\" said Zero.\nStanley let out a short laugh. He wasn't laughing at Zero. He was just surprised. All\nthis time he had thought Zero was reading over his shoulder. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I don't\nknow how to teach.\"\nAfter digging all day, he didn't have the strength to try to teach Zero to read and\nwrite. He needed to save his energy for the people who counted.\n\"You don't have to teach me to write,\" said Zero. \"Just to read. I don't have anybody\nto write to.\"\n\"Sorry,\" Stanley said again.\n\n37\nHis muscles and hands weren't the only parts of his body that had toughened over\nthe past several weeks. His heart had hardened as well.\nHe finished his letter. He barely had enough moisture in his mouth to seal and stamp\nthe envelope. It seemed that no matter how much water he drank, he was always thirsty.\n\n19\nHe was awakened one night by a strange noise. At first he thought it might have\nbeen some kind of animal, and it frightened him. But as the sleep cleared from his head,\nhe realized that the noise was coming from the cot next to him.\nSquid was crying.\n\"You okay?\" Stanley whispered.\nSquid's head jerked around. He sniffed and caught his breath. \"Yeah, I just . . . I'm\nfine,\" he whispered, and sniffed again.\nIn the morning Stanley asked Squid if he was feeling better.\n\"What are you, my mother?\" asked Squid.\nStanley raised and lowered one shoulder.\n\"I got allergies, okay?\" Squid said.\n\"Okay,\" said Stanley.\n\"You open your mouth again, and I'll break your jaw.\"\nStanley kept his mouth shut most of the time. He didn't talk too much to any of the\nboys, afraid that he might say the wrong thing. They called him Caveman and all that,\nbut he couldn't forget that they were dangerous, too. They were all here for a reason. As\nMr. Sir would say, this wasn't a Girl Scout camp.\nStanley was thankful that there were no racial problems. X-Ray, Armpit, and Zero\nwere black. He, Squid, and Zigzag were white. Magnet was Hispanic. On the lake they\nwere all the same reddish brown color\u2014 the color of dirt.\nHe looked up from his hole to see the water truck and its trailing dust cloud. His\ncanteen was still almost a quarter full. He quickly drank it down, then took his place in\nline, behind Magnet and in front of Zero. The air was thick with heat, dust, and exhaust\nfumes.\nMr. Sir filled their canteens.\nThe truck pulled away. Stanley was back in his hole, shovel in hand, when he heard\nMagnet call out. \"Anybody want some sunflower seeds?\"\nMagnet was standing at ground level, holding a sack of seeds. He popped a handful\ninto his mouth, chewed, and swallowed, shells and all.\n\"Over here,\" called X-Ray.\nThe sack looked to be about half full. Magnet rolled up the top, then tossed it to\nX-Ray.\n\"How'd you get them without Mr. Sir seeing you?\" asked Armpit.\n\"I can't help it,\" Magnet said. He held both hands up, wiggled his fingers, and\nlaughed. \"My fingers are like little magnets.\"\n\n38\n\nThe sack went from X-Ray to Armpit to Squid.\n\"It's sure good to eat something that doesn't come from a can,\" said Armpit.\nSquid tossed the sack to Zigzag.\nStanley knew it would come to him next. He didn't even want it. From the moment\nMagnet shouted, \"Anybody want some sunflower seeds,\" he knew there would be\ntrouble. Mr. Sir was sure to come back. And anyway, the salted shells would only make\nhim thirsty.\n\"Coming your way, Caveman,\" said Zigzag. \"Airmail and special delivery . . .\"\nIt's unclear whether the seeds spilled before they got to Stanley or after he dropped\nthe bag. It seemed to him that Zigzag hadn't rolled up the top before throwing it, and\nthat was the reason he didn't catch it.\nBut it all happened very fast. One moment the sack was flying through the air, and\nthe next thing Stanley knew the sack was in his hole and the seeds were spilled across\nthe dirt.\n\"Oh, man!\" said Magnet.\n\"Sorry,\" Stanley said as he tried to sweep the seeds back into the sack.\n\"I don't want to eat dirt,\" said X-Ray.\nStanley didn't know what to do.\n\"The truck's coming!\" shouted Zigzag.\nStanley looked up at the approaching dust cloud, then back down at the spilled\nseeds. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nWhat else is new?\nHe dug his shovel into his hole, and tried to turn over the dirt and bury the seeds.\nWhat he should have done, he realized later, was knock one of his dirt piles back\ninto his hole. But the idea of putting dirt into his hole was unthinkable.\n\"Hello, Mr. Sir,\" said X-Ray. \"Back so soon?\"\n\"It seems like you were just here,\" said Armpit.\n\"Time flies when you're having fun,\" said Magnet.\nStanley continued to turn the dirt over in his hole.\n\"You Girl Scouts having a good time?\" asked Mr. Sir. He moved from one hole to\nanother. He kicked a dirt pile by Magnet's hole, then he moved toward Stanley.\nStanley could see two seeds at the bottom of his hole. As he tried to cover them up,\nhe unearthed a corner of the sack.\n\"Well, what do you know, Caveman?\" said Mr. Sir, standing over him. \"It looks\nlike you found something.\"\nStanley didn't know what to do.\n\"Dig it out,\" Mr. Sir said. \"We'll take it to the Warden. Maybe she'll give you the\nrest of the day off.\"\n\"It's not anything,\" Stanley muttered.\n\"Let me be the judge of that,\" said Mr. Sir.\nStanley reached down and pulled up the empty burlap sack. He tried to hand it to Mr.\nSir, but he wouldn't take it.\n\"So, tell me, Caveman,\" said Mr. Sir. \"How did my sack of sunflower seeds get in\nyour hole?\"\n\n39\n\n\"I stole it from your truck.\"\n\"You did?\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Sir.\"\n\"What happened to all the sunflower seeds?\"\n\"I ate them.\"\n\"By yourself.\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Sir.\"\n\"Hey, Caveman!\" shouted Armpit. \"How come you didn't share any with us?\"\n\"That's cold, man,\" said X-Ray.\n\"I thought you were our friend,\" said Magnet.\nMr. Sir looked around from one boy to another, then back to Stanley. \"We'll see\nwhat the Warden has to say about this. Let's go.\"\nStanley climbed up out of his hole and followed Mr. Sir to the truck. He still held\nthe empty sack.\nIt felt good to sit inside the truck, out of the direct rays of the sun. Stanley was\nsurprised he could feel good about anything at the moment, but he did. It felt good to sit\ndown on a comfortable seat for a change. And as the truck bounced along the dirt, he\nwas able to appreciate the air blowing through the open window onto his hot and\nsweaty face.\n\n20\nIt felt good to walk in the shade of the two oak trees. Stanley wondered if this was\nhow a condemned man felt on his way to the electric chair\u2014 appreciating all of the good\nthings in life for the last time.\nThey had to step around holes to get to the cabin door. Stanley was surprised to see\nso many around the cabin. He would have expected the Warden to not want the campers\ndigging so close to her home. But several holes were right up against the cabin wall.\nThe holes were closer together here as well, and were of different shapes and sizes.\nMr. Sir knocked on the door. Stanley still held the empty sack.\n\"Yes?\" the Warden said, opening the door.\n\"There's been a little trouble out on the lake,\" Mr. Sir said. \"Caveman will tell you\nall about it.\"\nThe Warden stared at Mr. Sir a moment, then her gaze turned toward Stanley. He\nfelt nothing but dread now.\n\"Come in, I suppose,\" said the Warden. \"You're letting the cold out.\"\nIt was air-conditioned inside her cabin. The television was going. She picked up the\nremote and turned it off.\nShe sat down on a canvas chair. She was barefoot and wearing shorts. Her legs were\nas freckled as her face and arms.\n\"So what is it you have to tell me?\"\nStanley took a breath to steady himself. \"While Mr. Sir was filling the canteens, I\nsnuck into the truck and stole his sack of sunflower seeds.\"\n\n40\n\n\"I see.\" She turned to Mr. Sir. \"That's why you brought him here?\"\n\"Yes, but I think he's lying. I think someone else stole the sack, and Caveman is\ncovering up for X-Ray or somebody. It was a twenty-pound sack, and he claims to have\neaten them all by himself.\" He took the sack from Stanley and handed it to the Warden.\n\"I see,\" the Warden said again.\n\"The sack wasn't full,\" said Stanley. \"And I spilled a lot. You can check my hole.\"\n\"In that room, Caveman, there's a small flowered case. Will you get it for me,\nplease?\" She pointed to a door.\nStanley looked at the door, then at the Warden, then back at the door. He slowly\nwalked toward it.\nIt was a kind of dressing room, with a sink and a mirror. Next to the sink he saw the\ncase, white with pink roses.\nHe brought it back out to the Warden, and she set it on the glass coffee table in front\nof her. She unclasped the latch and opened the case.\nIt was a makeup case. Stanley's mother had one similar to it. He saw several bottles\nof nail polish, polish remover, a couple of lipstick tubes, and other jars and powders.\nThe Warden held up a small jar of dark-red nail polish. \"You see this, Caveman?\"\nHe nodded.\n\"This is my special nail polish. Do you see the dark rich color? You can't buy that in\na store. I have to make it myself.\"\nStanley had no idea why she was showing it to him. He wondered why the Warden\nwould ever have the need to wear nail polish or makeup.\n\"Do you want to know my secret ingredient?\"\nHe raised and lowered one shoulder.\nThe Warden opened the bottle. \"Rattlesnake venom.\" With a small paintbrush she\nbegan applying it to the nails on her left hand. \"It's perfectly harmless . . . when it's dry.\"\nShe finished her left hand. She waved it in the air for a few seconds, then began\npainting the nails on her right hand. \"It's only toxic while it's wet.\"\nShe finished painting her nails, then stood up. She reached over and touched\nStanley's face with her fingers. She ran her sharp wet nails very gently down his cheek.\nHe felt his skin tingle.\nThe nail on her pinkie just barely touched the wound behind his ear. A sharp sting\nof pain caused him to jump back.\nThe Warden turned to face Mr. Sir, who was sitting on the fireplace hearth.\n\"So you think he stole your sunflower seeds?\"\n\"No, he says he stole them, but I think it was\u2014 \"\nShe stepped toward him and struck him across the face.\nMr. Sir stared at her. He had three long red marks slanting across the left side of his\nface. Stanley didn't know if the redness was caused by her nail polish or his blood.\nIt took a moment for the venom to sink in. Suddenly, Mr. Sir screamed and clutched\nhis face with both hands. He let himself fall over, rolling off the hearth and onto the rug.\nThe Warden spoke softly. \"I don't especially care about your sunflower seeds.\"\nMr. Sir moaned.\n\"If you must know,\" said the Warden, \"I liked it better when you smoked.\"\n\n41\nFor a second, Mr. Sir's pain seemed to recede. He took several long, deep breaths.\nThen his head jerked violently, and he let out a shrill scream, worse than the one before.\nThe Warden turned to Stanley. \"I suggest you go back to your hole now.\"\nStanley started to go, but Mr. Sir lay in the way. Stanley could see the muscles on\nhis face jump and twitch. His body writhed in agony.\nStanley stepped carefully over him. \"Is he\u2014 ?\"\n\"Excuse me?\" said the Warden.\nStanley was too frightened to speak.\n\"He's not going to die,\" the Warden said. \"Unfortunately for you.\"\n\n21\nIt was a long walk back to his hole. Stanley looked out through the haze of heat and\ndirt at the other boys, lowering and raising their shovels. Group D was the farthest\naway.\nHe realized that once again he would be digging long after everyone else had quit.\nHe hoped he'd finish before Mr. Sir recovered. He didn't want to be out there alone with\nMr. Sir.\nHe won't die, the Warden had said. Unfortunately for you.\nWalking across the desolate wasteland, Stanley thought about his\ngreat-grandfather\u2014 not the pig stealer but the pig stealer's son, the one who was robbed\nby Kissin' Kate Barlow.\nHe tried to imagine how he must have felt after Kissin' Kate had left him stranded in\nthe desert. It probably wasn't a whole lot different from the way he himself felt now.\nKate Barlow had left his great-grandfather to face the hot barren desert. The Warden\nhad left Stanley to face Mr. Sir.\nSomehow his great-grandfather had survived for seventeen days, before he was\nrescued by a couple of rattlesnake hunters. He was insane when they found him.\nWhen he was asked how he had lived so long, he said he \"found refuge on God's\nthumb.\"\nHe spent nearly a month in a hospital. He ended up marrying one of the nurses.\nNobody ever knew what he meant by God's thumb, including himself.\nStanley heard a twitching sound. He stopped in mid-step, with one foot still in the\nair.\nA rattlesnake lay coiled beneath his foot. Its tail was pointed upward, rattling.\nStanley backed his leg away, then turned and ran.\nThe rattlesnake didn't chase after him. It had rattled its tail to warn him to stay away.\n\"Thanks for the warning,\" Stanley whispered as his heart pounded.\nThe rattlesnake would be a lot more dangerous if it didn't have a rattle.\n\"Hey, Caveman!\" called Armpit. \"You're still alive.\"\n\"What'd the Warden say?\" asked X-Ray.\n\"What'd you tell her?\" asked Magnet.\n\n42\n\n\"I told her I stole the seeds,\" said Stanley.\n\"Good going,\" said Magnet.\n\"What'd she do?\" asked Zigzag.\nStanley shrugged one shoulder. \"Nothing. She got mad at Mr. Sir for bothering\nher.\"\nHe didn't feel like going into details. If he didn't talk about it, then maybe it didn't\nhappen.\nHe went over to his hole, and to his surprise it was nearly finished. He stared at it,\namazed. It didn't make sense.\nOr perhaps it did. He smiled. Since he had taken the blame for the sunflower seeds,\nhe realized, the other boys had dug his hole for him.\n\"Hey, thanks,\" he said.\n\"Don't look at me,\" said X-Ray.\nConfused, Stanley looked around\u2014 from Magnet, to Armpit, to Zigzag, to Squid.\nNone of them took credit for it.\nThen he turned to Zero, who had been quietly digging in his hole since Stanley's\nreturn. Zero's hole was smaller than all the others.\n\n22\nStanley was the first one finished. He spat in his hole, then showered and changed\ninto his cleaner set of clothes. It had been three days since the laundry was done, so\neven his clean set was dirty and smelly. Tomorrow, these would become his work\nclothes, and his other set would be washed.\nHe could think of no reason why Zero would dig his hole for him. Zero didn't even\nget any sunflower seeds.\n\"I guess he likes to dig holes,\" Armpit had said.\n\"He's a mole,\" Zigzag had said. \"I think he eats dirt.\"\n\"Moles don't eat dirt,\" X-Ray had pointed out. \"Worms eat dirt.\"\n\"Hey, Zero?\" Squid had asked. \"Are you a mole or a worm?\"\nZero had said nothing.\nStanley never even thanked him. But now he sat on his cot and waited for Zero to\nreturn from the shower room.\n\"Thanks,\" he said as Zero entered through the tent flap.\nZero glanced at him, then went over to the crates, where he deposited his dirty\nclothes and towel.\n\"Why'd you help me?\" Stanley asked.\nZero turned around. \"You didn't steal the sunflower seeds,\" he said.\n\"So, neither did you,\" said Stanley.\nZero stared at him. His eyes seemed to expand, and it was almost as if Zero were\nlooking right through him. \"You didn't steal the sneakers,\" he said.\nStanley said nothing.\nHe watched Zero walk out of the tent. If anybody had X-ray vision, it was Zero.\n\n43\n\n\"Wait!\" he called, then hurried out after him.\nZero had stopped just outside the tent, and Stanley almost ran into him.\n\"I'll try to teach you to read if you want,\" Stanley offered. \"I don't know if I know\nhow to teach, but I'm not that worn-out today, since you dug a lot of my hole.\"\nA big smile spread across Zero's face.\nThey returned to the tent, where they were less likely to be bothered. Stanley got his\nbox of stationery and a pen out of his crate. They sat on the ground.\n\"Do you know the alphabet?\" Stanley asked.\nFor a second, he thought he saw a flash of defiance in Zero's eyes, but then it passed.\n\"I think I know some of it,\" Zero said. \"A, B, C, D.\"\n\"Keep going,\" said Stanley.\nZero's eyes looked upward. \"E . . .\"\n\"F,\" said Stanley.\n\"G,\" said Zero. He blew some air out of the side of his mouth. \"H . . . I . . . K, P.\"\n\"H, I, J, K, L,\" Stanley said.\n\"That's right,\" said Zero. \"I've heard it before. I just don't have it memorized\nexactly.\"\n\"That's all right,\" said Stanley. \"Here, I'll say the whole thing, just to kind of refresh\nyour memory, then you can try it.\"\nHe recited the alphabet for Zero, then Zero repeated it without a single mistake.\nNot bad for a kid who had never seen Sesame Street!\n\"Well, I've heard it before, somewhere,\" Zero said, trying to act like it was nothing,\nbut his big smile gave him away.\nThe next step was harder. Stanley had to figure out how to teach him to recognize\neach letter. He gave Zero a piece of paper, and took a piece for himself. \"I guess we'll\nstart with A.\"\nHe printed a capital A, and then Zero copied it on his sheet of paper. The paper\nwasn't lined, which made it more difficult, but Zero's A wasn't bad, just a little big.\nStanley told him he needed to write smaller, or else they'd run out of paper real quick.\nZero printed it smaller.\n\"Actually, there are two ways to write each letter,\" Stanley said, as he realized this\nwas going to be even harder than he thought. \"That's a capital A. But usually you'll see\na small a. You only have capitals at the beginning of a word, and only if it's the start of\na sentence, or if it's a proper noun, like a name.\"\nZero nodded as if he understand, but Stanley knew he had made very little sense.\nHe printed a lowercase a, and Zero copied it.\n\"So there are fifty-two,\" said Zero.\nStanley didn't know what he was talking about.\n\"Instead of twenty-six letters. There are really fifty-two.\"\nStanley looked at him, surprised. \"I guess that's right. How'd you figure that out?\"\nhe asked.\nZero said nothing.\n\"Did you add?\"\nZero said nothing.\n\n44\n\n\"Did you multiply?\"\n\"That's just how many there are,\" said Zero.\nStanley raised and lowered one shoulder. He didn't even know how Zero knew there\nwere twenty-six in the first place. Did he count them as he recited them?\nHe had Zero write a few more upper- and lowercase A's, and then he moved on to a\ncapital B. This was going to take a long time, he realized.\n\"You can teach me ten letters a day,\" suggested Zero. \"Five capitals and five smalls.\nAfter five days I'll know them all. Except on the last day I'll have to do twelve. Six\ncapitals and six smalls.\"\nAgain Stanley stared at him, amazed that he was able to figure all that out.\nZero must have thought he was staring for a different reason, because he said, \"I'll\ndig part of your hole every day. I can dig for about an hour, then you can teach me for an\nhour. And since I'm a faster digger anyway, our holes will get done about the same time.\nI won't have to wait for you.\"\n\"Okay,\" Stanley agreed.\nAs Zero was printing his B's, Stanley asked him how he figured out it would take\nfive days. \"Did you multiply? Did you divide?\"\n\"That's just what it is,\" Zero said.\n\"It's good math,\" said Stanley.\n\"I'm not stupid,\" Zero said. \"I know everybody thinks I am. I just don't like\nanswering their questions.\"\nLater that night, as he lay on his cot, Stanley reconsidered the deal he had made with\nZero. Getting a break every day would be a relief, but he knew X-Ray wouldn't like it.\nHe wondered if there might be some way Zero would agree to dig part of X-Ray's hole\nas well. But then again, why should he? I'm the one teaching Zero. I need the break so\nI'll have the energy to ' teach him. I'm the one who took the blame for the sunflower\nseeds. I'm the one who Mr. Sir is mad at.\nHe closed his eyes, and images from the Warden's cabin floated inside his head: her\nred fingernails, Mr. Sir writhing on the floor, her flowered makeup kit.\nHe opened his eyes.\nHe suddenly realized where he'd seen the gold tube before.\nHe'd seen it in his mother's bathroom, and he'd seen it again in the Warden's cabin.\nIt was half of a lipstick container.\nKB?\nKB?\nHe felt a jolt of astonishment.\nHis mouth silently formed the name Kate Barlow, as he wondered if it really could\nhave belonged to the kissin' outlaw.\n\n23\n\n45\nOne hundred and ten years ago, Green Lake was the largest lake in Texas. It was\nfull of clear cool water, and it sparkled like a giant emerald in the sun. It was especially\nbeautiful in the spring, when the peach trees, which lined the shore, bloomed with pink\nand rose-colored blossoms.\nThere was always a town picnic on the Fourth of July. They'd play games, dance,\nsing, and swim in the lake to keep cool. Prizes were awarded for the best peach pie and\npeach jam.\nA special prize was given every year to Miss Katherine Barlow for her fabulous\nspiced peaches. No one else even tried to make spiced peaches, because they knew\nnone could be as delicious as hers.\nEvery summer Miss Katherine would pick bushels of peaches and preserve them in\njars with cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and other spices which she kept secret. The jarred\npeaches would last all winter. They probably would have lasted a lot longer than that,\nbut they were always eaten by the end of winter.\nIt was said that Green Lake was \"heaven on earth\" and that Miss Katherine's spiced\npeaches were \"food for the angels.\"\nKatherine Barlow was the town's only schoolteacher. She taught in an old one-room\nschoolhouse. It was old even then. The roof leaked. The windows wouldn't open. The\ndoor hung crooked on its bent hinges.\nShe was a wonderful teacher, full of knowledge and full of life. The children loved\nher.\nShe taught classes in the evening for adults, and many of the adults loved her as\nwell. She was very pretty. Her classes were often full of young men, who were a lot\nmore interested in the teacher than they were in getting an education.\nBut all they ever got was an education.\nOne such young man was Trout Walker. His real name was Charles Walker, but\neveryone called him Trout because his two feet smelled like a couple of dead fish.\nThis wasn't entirely Trout's fault. He had an incurable foot fungus. In fact, it was the\nsame foot fungus that a hundred and ten years later would afflict the famous ballplayer\nClyde Livingston. But at least Clyde Livingston showered every day.\n\"I take a bath every Sunday morning,\" Trout would brag, \"whether I need to or not.\"\nMost everyone in the town of Green Lake expected Miss Katherine to marry Trout\nWalker. He was the son of the richest man in the county. His family owned most of the\npeach trees and all the land on the east side of the lake.\nTrout often showed up at night school but never paid attention. He talked in class\nand was disrespectful of the students around him. He was loud and stupid.\nA lot of men in town were not educated. That didn't bother Miss Katherine. She\nknew they'd spent most of their lives working on farms and ranches and hadn't had\nmuch schooling. That was why she was there\u2014 to teach them.\nBut Trout didn't want to learn. He seemed to be proud of his stupidity.\n\"How'd you like to take a ride on my new boat this Saturday?\" he asked her one\nevening after class.\n\"No, thank you,\" said Miss Katherine.\n\"We've got a brand-new boat,\" he said. \"You don't even have to row it.\"\n\n46\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Miss Katherine.\nEveryone in town had seen\u2014 and heard\u2014 the Walkers' new boat. It made a horrible\nloud noise and spewed ugly black smoke over the beautiful lake.\nTrout had always gotten everything he ever wanted. He found it hard to believe that\nMiss Katherine had turned him down. He pointed his finger at her and said, \"No one\never says 'No' to Charles Walker!\"\n\"I believe I just did,\" said Katherine Barlow.\n\n24\nStanley was half asleep as he got in line for breakfast, but the sight of Mr. Sir\nawakened him. The left side of Mr. Sir's face had swollen to the size of half a\ncantaloupe. There were three dark-purple jagged lines running down his cheek where\nthe Warden had scratched him.\nThe other boys in Stanley's tent had obviously seen Mr. Sir as well, but they had the\ngood sense not to say anything. Stanley put a carton of juice and a plastic spoon on his\ntray. He kept his eyes down and hardly breathed as Mr. Sir ladled some oatmeal-like\nstuff into his bowl.\nHe brought his tray to the table. Behind him, a boy from one of the other tents said,\n\"Hey, what happened to your face?\"\nThere was a crash.\nStanley turned to see Mr. Sir holding the boy's head against the oatmeal pot. \"Is\nsomething wrong with my face?\"\nThe boy tried to speak but couldn't. Mr. Sir had him by the throat.\n\"Does anyone see anything wrong with my face?\" asked Mr. Sir, as he continued to\nchoke the boy.\nNobody said anything.\nMr. Sir let the boy go. His head banged against the table as he fell to the ground.\nMr. Sir stood over him and asked, \"How does my face look to you now?\"\nA gurgling sound came out of the boy's mouth, then he managed to gasp the word,\n\"Fine.\"\n\"I'm kind of handsome, don't you think?\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Sir.\"\nOut on the lake, the other boys asked Stanley what he knew about Mr. Sir's face, but\nhe just shrugged and dug his hole. If he didn't talk about it, maybe it would go away.\nHe worked as hard and as fast as he could, not trying to pace himself. He just\nwanted to get off the lake and away from Mr. Sir as soon as possible. Besides, he knew\nhe'd get a break.\n\"Whenever you're ready, just let me know,\" Zero had said.\nThe first time the water truck came, it was driven by Mr. Pendanski. The second\ntime, Mr. Sir was driving.\n\n47\nNo one said anything except \"Thank you, Mr. Sir\" as he filled each canteen. No one\neven dared to look at his grotesque face.\nAs Stanley waited, he ran his tongue over the roof of his mouth and inside his\ncheeks. His mouth was as dry and as parched as the lake. The bright sun reflected off\nthe side mirror of the truck, and Stanley had to shield his eyes with his hand.\n\"Thank you, Mr. Sir,\" said Magnet, as he took his canteen from him.\n\"You thirsty, Caveman?\" Mr. Sir asked.\n\"Yes, Mr. Sir,\" Stanley said, handing his canteen to him.\nMr. Sir opened the nozzle, and the water flowed out of the tank, but it did not go\ninto Stanley's canteen. Instead, he held the canteen right next to the stream of water.\nStanley watched the water splatter on the dirt, where it was quickly absorbed by the\nthirsty ground.\nMr. Sir let the water run for about thirty seconds, then stopped. \"You want more?\"\nhe asked.\nStanley didn't say anything.\nMr. Sir turned the water back on, and again Stanley watched it pour onto the dirt.\n\"There, that should be plenty.\" He handed Stanley his empty canteen.\nStanley stared at the dark spot on the ground, which quickly shrank before his eyes.\n\"Thank you, Mr. Sir,\" he said.\n\n25\nThere was a doctor in the town of Green Lake, one hundred and ten years ago. His\nname was Dr. Hawthorn. And whenever people got sick, they would go see Doc\nHawthorn. But they would also see Sam, the onion man.\n\"Onions! Sweet, fresh onions!\" Sam would call, as he and his donkey, Mary Lou,\nwalked up and down the dirt roads of Green Lake. Mary Lou pulled a cart full of\nonions.\nSam's onion field was somewhere on the other side of the lake. Once or twice a\nweek he would tow across the lake and pick a new batch to fill the cart. Sam had big\nstrong arms, but it would still take all day for him to row across the lake and another day\nfor him to return. Most of the time he would leave Mary Lou in a shed, which the\nWalkers let him use at no charge, but sometimes he would take Mary Lou on his boat\nwith him.\nSam claimed that Mary Lou was almost fifty years old, which was, and still is,\nextraordinarily old for a donkey.\n\"She eats nothing but raw onions,\" Sam would say, holding up a white onion\nbetween his dark fingers. \"It's nature's magic vegetable. If a person ate nothing but raw\nonions, he could live to be two hundred years old.\"\nSam was not much older than twenty, so nobody was quite sure that Mary Lou was\nreally as old as he said she was. How would he know?\nStill, nobody ever argued with Sam. And whenever they were sick, they would go\nnot only to Doc Hawthorn but also to Sam.\n\n48\n\nSam always gave the same advice: \"Eat plenty of onions.\"\nHe said that onions were good for the digestion, the liver, the stomach, the lungs,\nthe heart, and the brain. \"If you don't believe me, just look at old Mary Lou here. She's\nnever been sick a day in her life.\"\nHe also had many different ointments, lotions, syrups, and pastes all made out of\nonion juice and different parts of the onion plant. This one cured asthma. That one was\nfor warts and pimples. Another was a remedy for arthritis.\nHe even had a special ointment which he claimed would cure baldness. \"Just rub it\non your husband's head every night when he's sleeping, Mrs. Collingwood, and soon his\nhair will be as thick and as long as Mary Lou's tail.\"\nDoc Hawthorn did not resent Sam. The folks of Green Lake were afraid to take\nchances. They would get regular medicine from Doc Hawthorn and onion concoctions\nfrom Sam. After they got over their illness, no one could be sure, not even Doc\nHawthorn, which of the two treatments had done the trick.\nDoc Hawthorn was almost completely bald, and in the morning his head often\nsmelled like onions.\nWhenever Katherine Barlow bought onions, she always bought an extra one or two\nand would let Mary Lou eat them out of her hand.\n\"Is something wrong?\" Sam asked her one day as she was feeding Mary Lou. \"You\nseem distracted.\"\n\"Oh, just the weather,\" said Miss Katherine. \"It looks like rain clouds moving in.\"\n\"Me and Mary Lou, we like the rain,\" said Sam.\n\"Oh, I like it fine,\" said Miss Katherine, as she rubbed the donkey's rough hair on\ntop of its head. \"It's just that the roof leaks in the schoolhouse.\"\n\"I can fix that,\" said Sam.\n\"What are you going to do?\" Katherine joked. \"Fill the holes with onion paste?\"\nSam laughed. \"I'm good with my hands,\" he told her. \"I built my own boat. If it\nleaked, I'd be in big trouble.\"\nKatherine couldn't help but notice his strong, firm hands.\nThey made a deal. He agreed to fix the leaky roof in exchange for six jars of spiced\npeaches.\nIt took Sam a week to fix the roof, because he could only work in the afternoons,\nafter school let out and before night classes began. Sam wasn't allowed to attend classes\nbecause he was a Negro, but they let him fix the building.\nMiss Katherine usually stayed in the schoolhouse, grading papers and such, while\nSam worked on the roof. She enjoyed what little conversation they were able to have,\nshouting up and down to each other. She was surprised by his interest in poetry. When\nhe took a break, she would sometimes read a poem to him. On more than one occasion,\nshe would start to read a poem by Poe or Longfellow, only to hear him finish it for her,\nfrom memory.\nShe was sad when the roof was finished.\n\"Is something wrong?\" he asked.\n\n49\n\"No, you did a wonderful job,\" she said. \"It's just that . . . the windows won't open.\nThe children and I would enjoy a breeze now and then.\"\n\"I can fix that,\" said Sam.\nShe gave him two more jars of peaches and Sam fixed the windows.\nIt was easier to talk to him when he was working on the windows. He told her about\nhis secret onion field on the other side of the lake, \"where the onions grow all year\nround, and the water runs uphill.\"\nWhen the windows were fixed, she complained that her desk wobbled.\n\"I can fix that,\" said Sam.\nThe next time she saw him, she mentioned that \"the door doesn't hang straight,\" and\nshe got to spend another afternoon with him while he fixed the door.\nBy the end of the first semester, Onion Sam had turned the old run-down\nschoolhouse into a well-crafted, freshly painted jewel of a building that the whole town\nwas proud of. People passing by would stop and admire it. \"That's our schoolhouse. It\nshows how much we value education here in Green Lake.\"\nThe only person who wasn't happy with it was Miss Katherine. She'd run out of\nthings needing to be fixed.\nShe sat at her desk one afternoon, listening to the pitter-patter of the rain on the roof.\nNo water leaked into the classroom, except for the few drops that came from her eyes.\n\"Onions! Hot sweet onions!\" Sam called, out on the street.\nShe ran to him. She wanted to throw her arms around him but couldn't bring herself\nto do it. Instead she hugged Mary Lou's neck.\n\"Is something wrong?\" he asked her.\n\"Oh, Sam,\" she said. \"My heart is breaking.\"\n\"I can fix that,\" said Sam.\nShe turned to him.\nHe took hold of both of her hands, and kissed her.\nBecause of the rain, there was nobody else out on the street. Even if there was,\nKatherine and Sam wouldn't have noticed. They were lost in their own world.\nAt that moment, however, Hattie Parker stepped out of the general store. They\ndidn't see her, but she saw them. She pointed her quivering finger in their direction and\nwhispered, \"God will punish you!\"\n\n26\nThere were no telephones, but word spread quickly through the small town. By the\nend of the day, everyone in Green Lake had heard that the schoolteacher had kissed the\nonion picker.\nNot one child showed up for school the next morning.\nMiss Katherine sat alone in the classroom and wondered if she had lost track of the\nday of the week. Perhaps it was Saturday. It wouldn't have surprised her. Her brain and\nheart had been spinning ever since Sam kissed her.\n\n50\nShe heard a noise outside the door, then suddenly a mob of men and women came\nstorming into the school building. They were led by Trout Walker.\n\"There she is!\" Trout shouted. \"The Devil Woman!\"\nThe mob was turning over desks and ripping down bulletin boards.\n\"She's been poisoning your children's brains with books,\" Trout declared.\nThey began piling all the books in the center of the room.\n\"Think about what you are doing!\" cried Miss Katherine.\nSomeone made a grab for her, tearing her dress, but she managed to get out of the\nbuilding. She ran to the sheriff's office.\nThe sheriff had his feet up on his desk and was drinking from a bottle of whiskey.\n\"Mornin', Miss Katherine,\" he said.\n\"They're destroying the schoolhouse,\" she said, gasping for breath. \"They'll burn it\nto the ground if someone doesn't stop them!\"\n\"Just calm your pretty self down a second,\" the sheriff said in a slow drawl. \"And\ntell me what you're talking about.\" He got up from his desk and walked over to her.\n\"Trout Walker has\u2014 \"\n\"Now don't go saying nothing bad about Charles Walker,\" said the sheriff.\n\"We don't have much time!\" urged Katherine. \"You've got to stop them.\"\n\"You're sure pretty,\" said the sheriff.\nMiss Katherine stared at him in horror.\n\"Kiss me,\" said the sheriff.\nShe slapped him across the face.\nHe laughed. \"You kissed the onion picker. Why won't you kiss me?\"\nShe tried to slap him again, but he caught her by the hand.\nShe tried to wriggle free. \"You're drunk!\" she yelled.\n\"I always get drunk before a hanging.\"\n\"A hanging? Who\u2014 \"\n\"It's against the law for a Negro to kiss a white woman.\"\n\"Well, then you'll have to hang me, too,\" said Katherine. \"Because I kissed him\nback.\"\n\"It ain't against the law for you to kiss him,\" the sheriff explained. \"Just for him to\nkiss you.\"\n\"We're all equal under the eyes of God,\" she declared.\nThe sheriff laughed. \"Then if Sam and I are equal, why won't you kiss me?\" He\nlaughed again. \"I'll make you a deal. One sweet kiss, and I won't hang your boyfriend.\nI'll just run him out of town.\"\nMiss Katherine jerked her hand free. As she hurried to the door, she heard the\nsheriff say, \"The law will punish Sam. And God will punish you.\"\nShe stepped back into the street and saw smoke rising from the schoolhouse. She\nran down to the lakefront, where Sam was hitching Mary Lou to the onion cart.\n\"Thank God, I found you,\" she sighed, hugging him. \"We've got to get out of here.\nNow!\"\n\"What\u2014 \"\n\n51\n\"Someone must have seen us kissing yesterday,\" she said. \"They set fire to the\nschoolhouse. The sheriff said he's going to hang you!\"\nSam hesitated for a moment, as if he couldn't quite believe it. He didn't want to\nbelieve it. \"C'mon, Mary Lou.\"\n\"We have to leave Mary Lou behind,\" said Katherine.\nSam stared at her a moment. There were tears in his eyes. \"Okay.\"\nSam's boat was in the water, tied to a tree by a long rope. He untied it, and they\nwaded through the water and climbed aboard. His powerful arms rowed them away\nfrom the shore.\nBut his powerful arms were no match for Trout Walker's motorized boat. They were\nlittle more than halfway across the lake when Miss Katherine heard the loud roar of the\nengine. Then she saw the ugly black smoke . . .\nThese are the facts:\nThe Walker boat smashed into Sam's boat. Sam was shot and killed in the water.\nKatherine Barlow was rescued against her wishes. When they returned to the shore, she\nsaw Mary Lou's body lying on the ground. The donkey had been shot in the head.\nThat all happened one hundred and ten years ago. Since then, not one drop of rain\nhas fallen on Green Lake.\nYou make the decision: Whom did God punish?\nThree days after Sam's death, Miss Katherine shot the sheriff while he was sitting in\nhis chair drinking a cup of coffee. Then she carefully applied a fresh coat of red lipstick\nand gave him the kiss he had asked for.\nFor the next twenty years Kissin' Kate Barlow was one of the most feared outlaws\nin all the West.\n\n27\nStanley dug his shovel into the ground. His hole was about three and a half feet deep\nin the center. He grunted as he pried up some dirt, then flung it off to the side. The sun\nwas almost directly overhead.\nHe glanced at his canteen lying beside his hole. He knew it was half full, but he\ndidn't take a drink just yet. He had to drink sparingly, because he didn't know who\nwould be driving the water truck the next time it came.\nThree days had passed since the Warden had scratched Mr. Sir. Every time Mr. Sir\ndelivered water, he poured Stanley's straight onto the ground.\nFortunately, Mr. Pendanski delivered the water more often than Mr. Sir. Mr.\nPendanski was obviously aware of what Mr. Sir was doing, because he always gave\nStanley a little extra. He'd fill Stanley's canteen, then let Stanley take a long drink, then\ntop it off for him.\nIt helped, too, that Zero was digging some of Stanley's hole for him. Although, as\nStanley had expected, the other boys didn't like to see Stanley sitting around while they\n\n52\nwere working. They'd say things like \"Who died and made you king?\" or \"It must be\nnice to have your own personal slave.\"\nWhen he tried pointing out that he was the one who took the blame for the\nsunflower seeds, the other boys said it was his fault because he was the one who spilled\nthem. \"I risked my life for those seeds,\" Magnet had said, \"and all I got was one lousy\nhandful.\"\nStanley had also tried to explain that he needed to save his energy so he could teach\nZero how to read, but the other boys just mocked him.\n\"Same old story, ain't it, Armpit?\" X-Ray had said. \"The white boy sits around\nwhile the black boy does all the work. Ain't that right, Caveman?\"\n\"No, that's not right,\" Stanley replied.\n\"No, it ain't,\" X-Ray agreed. \"It ain't right at all.\"\nStanley dug out another shovelful of dirt. He knew X-Ray wouldn't have been\ntalking like that if he was the one teaching Zero to read. Then X-Ray would be talking\nabout how important it was that he got his rest, right? So he could be a better teacher,\nright?\nAnd that was true. He did need to save his strength so he could be a better teacher,\nalthough Zero was a quick learner. Sometimes, in fact, Stanley hoped the Warden was\nwatching them, with her secret cameras and microphones, so she'd know that Zero\nwasn't as stupid as everyone thought.\nFrom across the lake he could see the approaching dust cloud. He took a drink from\nhis canteen, then waited to see who was driving the truck.\nThe swelling on Mr. Sir's face had gone down, but it was still a little puffy. There\nhad been three scratch marks down his cheek. Two of the marks had faded, but the\nmiddle scratch must have been the deepest, because it still remained. It was a jagged\npurple line running from below his eye to below his mouth, like a tattoo of a scar.\nStanley waited in line, then handed him his canteen.\nMr. Sir held it up to his ear and shook it. He smiled at the swishing sound.\nStanley hoped he wouldn't dump it out.\nTo his surprise, Mr. Sir held the canteen under the stream of water and filled it.\n\"Wait here,\" he said.\nStill holding Stanley's canteen, Mr. Sir walked past him, then went around the side\nof the truck and into the cab, where he couldn't be seen.\n\"What's he doing in there?\" asked Zero.\n\"I wish I knew,\" said Stanley.\nA short while later, Mr. Sir came out of the truck and handed Stanley his canteen. It\nwas still full.\n\"Thank you, Mr. Sir.\"\nMr. Sir smiled at him. \"What are you waiting for?\" he asked. \"Drink up.\" He\npopped some sunflower seeds into his mouth, chewed, and spit out the shells.\nStanley was afraid to drink it. He hated to think what land of vile substance Mr. Sir\nmight have put in it.\n\n53\nHe brought the canteen back to his hole. For a long time, he left it beside his hole as\nhe continued to dig. Then, when he was so thirsty that he could hardly stand it anymore,\nhe unscrewed the cap, turned the canteen over, and poured it all out onto the dirt. He\nwas afraid that if he'd waited another second, he might have taken a drink.\nAfter Stanley taught Zero the final six letters of the alphabet, he taught him to write\nhis name.\n\"Capital Z-e-r-o.\"\nZero wrote the letters as Stanley said them. \"Zero,\" he said, looking at his piece of\npaper. His smile was too big for his face.\nStanley watched him write it over and over again.\nZero Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero Zero . . .\nIn a way, it made him sad. He couldn't help but think that a hundred times zero was\nstill nothing.\n\"You know, that's not my real name,\" Zero said as they headed to the Wreck Room\nfor dinner.\n\"Well, yeah,\" Stanley said, \"I guess I knew that.\" He had never really been sure.\n\"Everyone's always called me Zero, even before I came here.\"\n\"Oh. Okay.\"\n\"My real name is Hector.\"\n\"Hector,\" Stanley repeated.\n\"Hector Zeroni.\"\n\n28\nAfter twenty years, Kate Barlow returned to Green Lake. It was a place where\nnobody would ever find her\u2014 a ghost town on a ghost lake.\nThe peach trees had all died, but there were a couple of small oak trees still growing\nby an old abandoned cabin. The cabin used to be on the eastern shore of the lake. Now\nthe edge of the lake was over five miles away, and it was little more than a small pond\nfull of dirty water.\nShe lived in the cabin. Sometimes she could hear Sam's voice echoing across the\nemptiness. \"Onions! Sweet fresh onions.\"\nShe knew she was crazy. She knew she'd been crazy for the last twenty years.\n\"Oh, Sam,\" she would say, speaking into the vast emptiness. \"I know it is hot, but I\nfeel so very cold. My hands are cold. My feet are cold. My face is cold. My heart is\ncold.\"\nAnd sometimes she would hear him say, \"I can fix that,\" and she'd feel his warm\narm across her shoulders.\nShe'd been living in the cabin about three months when she was awakened one\nmorning by someone kicking open the cabin door. She opened her eyes to see the blurry\nend of a rifle, two inches from her nose.\nShe could smell Trout Walker's dirty feet.\n\n54\n\"You've got exactly ten seconds to tell me where you've hidden your loot,\" said\nTrout. \"Or else I'll blow your head off.\"\nShe yawned.\nA redheaded woman was there with Trout. Kate could see her rummaging through\nthe cabin, dumping drawers and knocking things from the shelves of cabinets.\nThe woman came to her. \"Where is it?\" she demanded.\n\"Linda Miller?\" asked Kate. \"Is that you?\"\nLinda Miller had been in the fourth grade when Kate Barlow was still a teacher. She\nhad been a cute freckle-faced girl with beautiful red hair. Now her face was blotchy,\nand her hair was dirty and scraggly.\n\"It's Linda Walker now,\" said Trout.\n\"Oh, Linda, I'm so sorry,\" said Kate.\nTrout jabbed her throat with the rifle. \"Where's the loot?\"\n\"There is no loot,\" said Kate.\n\"Don't give me that!\" shouted Trout. \"You've robbed every bank from here to\nHouston.\"\n\"You better tell him,\" said Linda. \"We're desperate.\"\n\"You married him for his money, didn't you?\" asked Kate.\nLinda nodded. \"But it's all gone. It dried up with the lake. The peach trees. The\nlivestock. I kept thinking: It has to rain soon. The drought can't last forever. But it just\nkept getting hotter and hotter and hotter . . .\" Her eyes fixed on the shovel, which was\nleaning up against the fireplace. \"She's buried it!\" she declared.\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" said Kate.\nThere was a loud blast as Trout fired his rifle just above her head. The window\nbehind her shattered. \"Where's it buried?\" he demanded.\n\"Go ahead and kill me, Trout,\" said Kate. \"But I sure hope you like to dig. 'Cause\nyou're going to be digging for a long time. It's a big vast wasteland out there. You, and\nyour children, and their children, can dig for the next hundred years and you'll never\nfind it.\"\nLinda grabbed Kate's hair and jerked her head back. \"Oh, we're not going to kill\nyou,\" she said. \"But by the time we're finished with you, you're going to wish you were\ndead.\"\n\"I've been wishing I was dead for the last twenty years,\" said Kate.\nThey dragged her out of bed and pushed her outside. She wore blue silk pajamas.\nHer turquoise-studded black boots remained beside her bed.\nThey loosely tied her legs together so she could walk, but she couldn't run. They\nmade her walk barefoot on the hot ground.\nThey wouldn't let her stop walking.\n\"Not until you take us to the loot,\" said Trout.\nLinda hit Kate on the back of her legs with the shovel. \"You're going to take us to it\nsooner or later. So you might as well make it sooner.\"\nShe walked one way, then the other, until her feet were black and blistered.\nWhenever she stopped, Linda whacked her with the shovel.\n\"I'm losing my patience,\" warned Trout.\n\n55\n\nShe felt the shovel jab into her back, and she fell onto hard dirt.\n\"Get up!\" ordered Linda.\nKate struggled to her feet.\n\"We're being easy on you today,\" said Trout. \"It's just going to keep getting worse\nand worse for you until you take us to it.\"\n\"Look out!\" shouted Linda.\nA lizard leaped toward them. Kate could see its big red eyes.\nLinda tried to hit it with the shovel, and Trout shot at it, but they both missed.\nThe lizard landed on Kate's bare ankle. Its sharp black teeth bit into her leg. Its\nwhite tongue lapped up the droplets of blood that leaked out of the wound.\nKate smiled. There was nothing they could do to her anymore. \"Start digging,\" she\nsaid.\n\"Where is it?\" Linda screeched.\n\"Where'd you bury it?\" Trout demanded.\nKate Barlow died laughing.\n\nPART TWO\nTHE LAST HOLE\n\n29\nThere was a change in the weather.\nFor the worse.\nThe air became unbearably humid. Stanley was drenched in sweat. Beads of\nmoisture ran down the handle of his shovel. It was almost as if the temperature had\ngotten so hot that the air itself was sweating.\nA loud boom of thunder echoed across the empty lake.\nA storm was way off to the west, beyond the mountains. Stanley could count more\nthan thirty seconds between the flash of lightning and the clap of thunder. That was how\nfar away the storm was. Sound travels a great distance across a barren wasteland.\nUsually, Stanley couldn't see the mountains at this time of day. The only time they\nwere visible was just at sunup, before the air became hazy. Now, however, the sky was\nvery dark off to the west, and every time the lightning flashed, the dark shape of the\nmountains would briefly appear.\n\"C'mon, rain!\" shouted Armpit. \"Blow this way!\"\n\"Maybe it'll rain so hard it will fill up the whole lake,\" said Squid. \"We can go\nswimming.\"\n\"Forty days and forty nights,\" said X-Ray. \"Guess we better start building us an ark.\nGet two of each animal, right?\"\n\"Right,\" said Zigzag. \"Two rattlesnakes. Two scorpions. Two yellow-spotted\nlizards.\"\n\n56\nThe humidity, or maybe the electricity in the air, had made Zigzag's head even more\nwild-looking. His frizzy blond hair stuck almost straight out.\nThe horizon lit up with a huge web of lightning. In that split second Stanley thought\nhe saw an unusual rock formation on top of one of the mountain peaks. The peak looked\nto him exactly like a giant fist, with the thumb sticking straight up.\nThen it was gone.\nAnd Stanley wasn't sure whether he'd seen it or not.\n\"I found refuge on God's thumb.\"\nThat was what his great-grandfather had supposedly said after Kate Barlow had\nrobbed him and left him stranded in the desert.\nNo one ever knew what he meant by that. He was delirious when he said it.\n\"But how could he live for three weeks without food or water?\" Stanley had asked\nhis father.\n\"I don't know. I wasn't there,\" replied his father. \"I wasn't born yet. My father wasn't\nborn yet. My grandmother, your great-grandmother, was a nurse in the hospital where\nthey treated him. He'd always talked about how she'd dab his forehead with a cool wet\ncloth. He said that's why he fell in love with her. He thought she was an angel.\"\n\"A real angel?\"\nHis father didn't know.\n\"What about after he got better? Did he ever say what he meant by God's thumb, or\nhow he survived?\"\n\"No. He just blamed his no-good-pig-stealing-father.\"\nThe storm moved off farther west, along with any hope of rain. But the image of the\nfist and thumb remained in Stanley's head. Although, instead of lightning flashing\nbehind the thumb, in Stanley's mind, the lightning was coming out of the thumb, as if it\nwere the thumb of God.\n\n30\nThe next day was Zigzag's birthday. Or so he said. Zigzag lay in his cot as everyone\nheaded outside. \"I get to sleep in, because it's my birthday.\"\nThen a little while later he cut into the breakfast line, just in front of Squid. Squid\ntold him to go to the end of the line. \"Hey, it's my birthday,\" Zigzag said, staying where\nhe was.\n\"It's not your birthday,\" said Magnet, who was standing behind Squid.\n\"Is too,\" said Zigzag. \"July 8.\"\nStanley was behind Magnet. He didn't know what day of the week it was, let alone\nthe date. It could have been July 8, but how would Zigzag know?\nHe tried to figure out how long he'd been at Camp Green Lake, if indeed it was July\n8. \"I came here on May 24,\" he said aloud. \"So that means I've been here . . .\"\n\"Forty-six days,\" said Zero.\n\n57\nStanley was still trying to remember how many days there were in May and June.\nHe looked at Zero. He'd learned not to doubt him when it came to math.\nForty-six days. It felt more like a thousand. He didn't dig a hole that first day, and he\nhadn't dug one yet today. That meant he'd dug forty-four holes\u2014 if it really was July 8.\n\"Can I have an extra carton of juice?\" Zigzag asked Mr. Sir. \"It's my birthday.\"\nTo everyone's surprise, Mr. Sir gave it to him.\nStanley dug his shovel into the dirt. Hole number 45. \"The forty-fifth hole is the\nhardest,\" he said to himself.\nBut that really wasn't true, and he knew it. He was a lot stronger than when he first\narrived. His body had adjusted somewhat to the heat and harsh conditions.\nMr. Sir was no longer depriving him of water. After having to get by on less water\nfor a week or so, Stanley now felt like he had all the water he could want.\nOf course it helped that Zero dug some of his hole for him each day, but that wasn't\nas great as everyone thought it was. He always felt awkward while Zero was digging his\nhole, unsure of what to do with himself. Usually he stood around awhile, before sitting\noff by himself on the hard ground, with the sun beating down on him.\nIt was better than digging.\nBut not a lot better.\nWhen the sun came up a couple of hours later, Stanley looked for \"the thumb of\nGod.\" The mountains were little more than dark shadows on the horizon.\nHe thought he could make out a spot where the top of one mountain seemed to jut\nupward, but it didn't seem very impressive. A short time later the mountains were no\nlonger visible, hidden behind the glare of the sun, reflecting off the dirty air.\nIt was possible, he realized, that he was somewhere near where Kate Barlow had\nrobbed his great-grandfather. If that was really her lipstick tube he'd found, then she\nmust have lived somewhere around here.\nZero took his turn before the lunch break. Stanley climbed out of his hole, and Zero\nclimbed down into it.\n\"Hey, Caveman,\" said Zigzag. \"You should get a whip. Then if your slave doesn't\ndig fast enough, you can crack it across his back.\"\n\"He's not my slave,\" said Stanley. \"We have a deal, that's all.\"\n\"A good deal for you,\" said Zigzag.\n\"It was Zero's idea, not mine.\"\n\"Don't you know, Zig?\" said X-Ray, coming over. \"Caveman's doing Zero a big\nfavor. Zero likes to dig holes.\"\n\"He sure is a nice guy to let Zero dig his hole for him,\" said Squid.\n\"Well, what about me?\" asked Armpit. \"I like to dig holes, too. Can I dig for you,\nCaveman, after Zero's finished?\"\nThe other boys laughed.\n\"No, I want to,\" said Zigzag. \"It's my birthday.\"\nStanley tried his best to ignore them.\nZigzag kept at it. \"Come on, Caveman. Be a pal. Let me dig your hole.\"\n\n58\n\nStanley smiled, as if it were all a big joke.\nWhen Mr. Pendanski arrived with water\" and lunch, Zigzag offered Stanley his\nplace in line. \"Since you're so much better than me.\"\nStanley remained where he was. \"I didn't say I was bet\u2014 \"\n\"You're insulting him, Zig,\" said X-Ray. \"Why should Caveman take your place,\nwhen he deserves to be at the very front? He's better than all of us. Aren't you,\nCaveman?\"\n\"No,\" said Stanley.\n\"Sure you are,\" said X-Ray. \"Now come to the front of the line where you belong.\"\n\"That's okay,\" said Stanley.\n\"No, it's not okay,\" said X-Ray. \"Get up here.\"\nStanley hesitated, then moved to the front of the line.\n\"Well, this is a first,\" Mr. Pendanski said, coming around the side of the truck. He\nfilled Stanley's canteen and handed him a sack lunch.\nStanley was glad to get away. He sat down between his hole and Zero's. He was\nglad that he'd be digging his own hole for the rest of the day. Maybe the other boys\nwould leave him alone. Maybe he shouldn't let Zero dig his hole for him anymore. But\nhe needed to save his energy to be a good teacher.\nHe bit into his sandwich, which contained some kind of meat-and-cheese mixture\nthat came in a can. Just about everything at Green Lake came in a can. The supply truck\ncame once a month.\nHe glanced up to see Zigzag and Squid walking toward him.\n\"I'll give you my cookie if you let me dig your hole,\" said Zigzag.\nSquid laughed.\n\"Here, take my cookie,\" said Zigzag, holding it out for him.\n\"No, thanks,\" said Stanley.\n\"C'mon, take my cookie,\" said Zigzag, sticking it in his face.\n\"Leave me alone,\" said Stanley.\n\"Please eat my cookie,\" said Zigzag, holding it under Stanley's nose.\nSquid laughed.\nStanley pushed it away.\nZigzag pushed him back. \"Don't push me!\"\n\"I didn't . . .\" Stanley got to his feet. He looked around. Mr. Pendanski was filling\nZero's canteen.\nZigzag pushed him again. \"I said, 'Don't push me.'\"\nStanley took a step backward, carefully avoiding Zero's hole.\nZigzag kept after him. He shoved Stanley and said, \"Quit pushing!\"\n\"Lay off,\" said Armpit, as he, Magnet, and X-Ray joined them.\n\"Why should he?\" snapped X-Ray. \"Caveman's bigger. He can take care of\nhimself.\"\n\"I don't want any trouble,\" Stanley said.\nZigzag pushed him hard. \"Eat my cookie,\" he said.\nStanley was glad to see Mr. Pendanski coming toward them, along with Zero.\n\"Hi, Mom,\" said Armpit. \"We were just fooling around.\"\n\n59\n\"I saw what was going on,\" Mr. Pendanski said. He turned to Stanley. \"Go ahead,\nStanley,\" he said. \"Hit him back. You're bigger.\"\nStanley stared at Mr. Pendanski in astonishment.\n\"Teach the bully a lesson,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\nZigzag hit Stanley on the shoulder with his open hand. \"Teach me a lesson,\" he\nchallenged.\nStanley made a feeble attempt to punch Zigzag, then he felt a flurry of fists against\nhis head and neck. Zigzag had hold of his collar with one hand and was hitting him with\nthe other.\nThe collar ripped and Stanley fell backward onto the dirt.\n\"That's enough!\" Mr. Pendanski yelled.\nIt wasn't enough for Zigzag. He jumped on top of Stanley.\n\"Stop!\" shouted Mr. Pendanski.\nThe side of Stanley's face was pressed flat against the dirt. He tried to protect\nhimself, but Zigzag's fists slammed off his arms and pounded his face into the ground.\nAll he could do was wait for it to be over.\nThen, suddenly, Zigzag was off of him. Stanley managed to look up, and he saw\nthat Zero had his arm around Zigzag's long neck.\nZigzag made a gagging sound, as he desperately tried to pry Zero's arm off of him.\n\"You're going to kill him!\" shouted Mr. Pendanski.\nZero kept squeezing.\nArmpit charged into them, freeing Zigzag from Zero's choke hold. The three boys\nfell to the ground in different directions.\nMr. Pendanski fired his pistol into the air.\nThe other counselors came running from the office, the tents, or out on the lake.\nThey had their guns drawn, but holstered them when they saw the trouble was over.\nThe Warden walked over from her cabin.\n\"There was a riot,\" Mr. Pendanski told her. \"Zero almost strangled Ricky.\"\nThe Warden looked at Zigzag, who was still stretching and massaging his neck.\nThen she turned her attention to Stanley, who was obviously in the worst condition.\n\"What happened to you?\"\n\"Nothing. It wasn't a riot.\"\n\"Ziggy was beating up the Caveman,\" said Armpit. \"Then Zero started choking\nZigzag, and I had to pull Zero off of Zigzag. It was all over before Mom fired his gun.\"\n\"They just got a little hot, that's all,\" said X-Ray. \"You know how it is. In the sun all\nday. People get hot, right? But everything's cool now.\"\n\"I see,\" the Warden said. She turned to Zigzag. \"What's the matter? Didn't you get a\npuppy for your birthday?\"\n\"Zig's just a little hot,\" said X-Ray. \"Out in the sun all day. You know how it is. The\nblood starts to boil.\"\n\"Is that what happened, Zigzag?\" asked the Warden.\n\"Yeah,\" said Zigzag. \"Like X-Ray said. Working so hard in the hot sun, while\nCaveman just sits around doing nothing. My blood boiled.\"\n\n60\n\"Excuse me?\" said the Warden. \"Caveman digs his holes, just like everyone else.\"\nZigzag shrugged. \"Sometimes.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"Zero's been digging part of Caveman's hole every day,\" said Squid.\nThe Warden looked from Squid to Stanley to Zero.\n\"I'm teaching him to read and write,\" said Stanley. \"It's sort of a trade. The hole still\ngets dug, so what does it matter who digs it?\"\n\"Excuse me?\" said the Warden.\n\"Isn't it more important for him to learn to read?\" Stanley asked. \"Doesn't that build\ncharacter more than digging holes?\"\n\"That's his character,\" said the Warden. \"What about your character?\"\nStanley raised and lowered one shoulder.\nThe Warden turned to Zero. \"Well, Zero, what have you learned so far?\"\nZero said nothing.\n\"Have you just been digging Caveman's hole for nothing?\" the Warden asked him.\n\"He likes to dig holes,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\n\"Tell me what you learned yesterday,\" said the Warden. \"Surely you can remember\nthat.\"\nZero said nothing.\nMr. Pendanski laughed. He picked up a shovel and said, \"You might as well try to\nteach this shovel to read! It's got more brains than Zero.\"\n\"The 'at' sound,\" said Zero.\n\"The 'at' sound,\" repeated the Warden. \"Well then, tell me, what does c-a-t spell?\"\nZero glanced around uneasily.\nStanley knew he knew the answer. Zero just didn't like answering questions.\n\"Cat,\" Zero said.\nMr. Pendanski clapped his hands. \"Bravo! Bravo! The boy's a genius!\"\n\"F-a-t?\" asked the Warden.\nZero thought a moment.\nStanley hadn't taught him the \"f\" sound yet.\n\"Eff,\" Zero whispered. \"Eff-at. Fat.\"\n\"How about h-a-t?\" asked the Warden.\nStanley hadn't taught him the \"h\" sound either.\nZero concentrated hard, then said, \"Chat.\"\nAll the counselors laughed.\n\"He's a genius, all right!\" said Mr. Pendanski. \"He's so stupid, he doesn't even know\nhe's stupid.\"\nStanley didn't know why Mr. Pendanski seemed to have it in for Zero. If Mr.\nPendanski only thought about it, he'd realize it was very logical for Zero to think that\nthe letter \"h\" made the \"ch\" sound.\n\"Okay, from now on, I don't want anyone digging anyone else's hole,\" said the\nWarden. \"And no more reading lessons.\"\n\"I'm not digging another hole,\" said Zero.\n\n61\n\"Good,\" said the Warden. She turned to Stanley. \"You know why you're digging\nholes? Because it's good for you. It teaches you a lesson. If Zero digs your hole for you,\nthen you're not learning your lesson, are you?\"\n\"I guess not,\" Stanley mumbled, although he knew they weren't digging just to learn\na lesson. She was looking for something, something that belonged to Kissin' Kate\nBarlow.\n\"Why can't I dig my own hole, but still teach Zero to read?\" he asked. \"What's\nwrong with that?\"\n\"I'll tell you what's wrong with that,\" the Warden said. \"It leads to trouble. Zero\nalmost killed Zigzag.\"\n\"It causes him stress,\" said Mr. Pendanski. \"I know you mean well, Stanley, but face\nit. Zero's too stupid to learn to read. That's what makes his blood boil. Not the hot sun.\"\n\"I'm not digging another hole,\" said Zero.\nMr. Pendanski handed him the shovel. \"Here, take it, Zero. It's all you'll ever be\ngood for.\"\nZero took the shovel.\nThen he swung it like a baseball bat.\nThe metal blade smashed across Mr. Pendanski's face. His knees crumpled beneath\nhim. He was unconscious before he hit the ground.\nThe counselors all drew their guns.\nZero held the shovel out in front of him, as if he were going to try to bat away the\nbullets. \"I hate digging holes,\" he said. Then he slowly backed away.\n\"Don't shoot him,\" said the Warden. \"He can't go anywhere. The last thing we need\nis an investigation.\"\nZero kept backing up, out past the cluster of holes the boys had been digging, then\nfarther and farther out onto the lake.\n\"He's going to have to come back for water,\" the Warden said.\nStanley noticed Zero's canteen lying on the ground near his hole.\nA couple of the counselors helped Mr. Pendanski to his feet and into the truck.\nStanley looked out toward Zero, but he had disappeared into the haze.\nThe Warden ordered the counselors to take turns guarding the shower room and\nWreck Room, all day and all night. They were not to let Zero drink any water. When he\nreturned, he was to be brought directly to her.\nShe examined her fingernails and said, \"It's almost time for me to paint my nails\nagain.\"\nBefore she left, she told the six remaining members of Group D that she still\nexpected seven holes.\n\n31\nStanley angrily dug his shovel into the dirt. He was angry at everyone\u2014 Mr.\nPendanski, the Warden, Zigzag, X-Ray, and his\n\n62\nno-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather. But mostly he was angry at\nhimself.\nHe knew he never should have let Zero dig part of his hole for him. He still could\nhave taught him to read. If Zero could dig all day and still have the strength to learn,\nthen he should have been able to dig all day and still have the strength to teach.\nWhat he should do, he thought, was go out after Zero.\nBut he didn't.\nNone of the others helped him dig Zero's hole, and he didn't expect them to. Zero\nhad been helping him dig his hole. Now he had to dig Zero's.\nHe remained out on the lake, digging during the hottest part of the day, long after\neveryone else had gone in. He kept an eye out for Zero, but Zero didn't come back.\nIt would have been easy to go out after Zero. There was nobody to stop him. He\nkept thinking that's what he should do.\nMaybe they could climb to the top of Big Thumb.\nIf it wasn't too far away. And if it was really the same place where his\ngreat-grandfather found refuge. And if, after a hundred years or so, water was still\nthere.\nIt didn't seem likely. Not when an entire lake had gone dry.\nAnd even if they did find refuge on Big Thumb, he thought, they'd still have to\ncome back here, eventually. Then they'd both have to face the Warden, and her\nrattlesnake fingers.\nInstead, he came up with a better idea, although he didn't have it quite all figured out\nyet. He thought that maybe he could make a deal with the Warden. He'd tell her where\nhe really found the gold tube if she wouldn't scratch Zero.\nHe wasn't sure how he'd make this deal without getting himself in deeper trouble.\nShe might just say, Tell me where you found it or I'll scratch you, too. Plus, it would\nmean X-Ray would get in trouble, too. She'd probably scratch him up as well.\nX-Ray would be out to get him for the next sixteen months.\nHe dug his shovel into the dirt.\nBy the next morning, Zero still hadn't returned. Stanley saw one of the counselors\nsitting guard by the water spigot outside the shower wall.\nMr. Pendanski had two black eyes and a bandage over his nose. \"I always knew he\nwas stupid,\" Stanley heard him say.\nStanley was required to dig only one hole the next day. As he dug, he kept a\nconstant watchout for Zero, but never saw him. Once again he considered going out on\nthe lake to look for him, but he began to realize that it was already too late.\nHis only hope was that Zero had found God's thumb on his own. It wasn't\nimpossible. His great-grandfather had found it. For some reason his great-grandfather\nhad felt the urge to climb to the top of that mountain. Maybe Zero would feel the same\nurge.\nIf it was the same mountain. If water was still there.\n\n63\nHe tried to convince himself it wasn't impossible. There had been a storm just a few\ndays ago. Maybe Big Thumb was actually some kind of natural water tower that caught\nand stored the rain.\nIt wasn't impossible.\nHe returned to his tent to find the Warden, Mr. Sir, and Mr. Pendanski all waiting\nfor him.\n\"Have you seen Zero?\" the Warden asked him.\n\"No.\"\n\"No sign of him at all?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Do you have any idea where he went?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"You know you're not doing him any favors if you're lying,\" said Mr. Sir. \"He can't\nsurvive out there for more than a day or two.\"\n\"I don't know where he is.\"\nAll three stared at Stanley as if they were trying to figure out if he was telling the\ntruth. Mr. Pendanski's face was so swollen, he could barely open his eyes. They were\njust slits.\n\"You sure he has no family?\" the Warden asked Mr. Pendanski.\n\"He's a ward of the state,\" Mr. Pendanski told her. \"He was living on the streets\nwhen he was arrested.\"\n\"Is there anyone who might ask questions? Some social worker who took an interest\nin him?\"\n\"He had nobody,\" said Mr. Pendanski. \"He was nobody.\"\nThe Warden thought a moment. \"Okay, I want you to destroy all of his records.\"\nMr. Pendanski nodded.\n\"He was never here,\" said the Warden.\nMr. Sir nodded.\n\"Can you get into the state files from our computer?\" she asked Mr. Pendanski. \"I\ndon't want anyone in the A.G.'s office to know he was here.\"\n\"I don't think I can erase him completely from all the state files,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\n\"Too many cross-references. But I can make it so it would be very difficult for anyone\nto ever find a record of him. Like I said, though, no one will ever look. No one cares\nabout Hector Zeroni.\"\n\"Good,\" said the Warden.\n\n32\nTwo days later a new kid was assigned to Group D. His name was Brian, but X-Ray\ncalled him Twitch because he was always fidgeting. Twitch was assigned Zero's bed,\nand Zero's crate.\nVacancies don't last long at Camp Green Lake.\n\n64\nTwitch had been arrested for stealing a car. He claimed he could break into a car,\ndisconnect the alarm, and hot-wire the engine, all in less than a minute.\n\"I never plan to, you know, steal one,\" he told them. \"But sometimes, you know, I'll\nbe walking past a real nice car, parked in a deserted area, and, you know, I'll just start\ntwitching. If you think I twitch now, you should see me when I'm around a car. The next\nthing I know, I'm behind the wheel.\"\nStanley lay on his scratchy sheets. It occurred to him that his cot no longer smelled\nbad. He wondered if the smell had gone away, or if he had just gotten used to it.\n\"Hey, Caveman,\" said Twitch. \"Do we really have to get up at 4:30?\"\n\"You get used to it,\" Stanley told him. \"It's the coolest part of the day.\"\nHe tried not to think about Zero. It was too late. Either he'd made it to Big Thumb,\nor . . .\nWhat worried him the most, however, wasn't that it was too late. What worried him\nthe most, what really ate at his insides, was the fear that it wasn't too late.\nWhat if Zero was still alive, desperately crawling across the dirt searching for\nwater?\nHe tried to force the image out of his mind.\nThe next morning, out on the lake, Stanley listened as Mr. Sir told Twitch the\nrequirements for his hole: \". . . as wide and as deep as your shovel.\"\nTwitch fidgeted. His fingers drummed against the wooden shaft of his shovel, and\nhis neck moved from side to side.\n\"You won't be twitching so much after digging all day,\" Mr. Sir told him. \"You\nwon't have the strength to wiggle your pinkie.\" He popped some sunflower seeds in his\nmouth, deftly chewed them, and spat out the shells. \"This isn't a Girl Scout camp.\"\nThe water truck came shortly after sunrise. Stanley got in line behind Magnet,\nahead of Twitch.\nWhat if it's not too late?\nHe watched Mr. Sir fill X-Ray's canteen. The image of Zero crawling across the hot\ndry dirt remained in his head.\nBut what could he do about it? Even if Zero was somehow alive after more than\nfour days, how would Stanley ever find him? It would take days. He'd need a car.\nOr a pickup truck. A pickup truck with a tank of water in the back.\nStanley wondered if Mr. Sir had left the keys in the ignition.\nHe slowly backed away from the line, then circled over to the side of the truck. He\nlooked through the window. The keys were there, dangling in the ignition.\nStanley felt his fingers start to twitch.\nHe took a deep breath to steady himself and tried to think clearly. He had never\ndriven before.\nBut how hard could it be?\nThis is really crazy, he told himself. Whatever he did, he knew he'd have to do it\nquickly, before Mr. Sir noticed.\nIt's too late, he told himself. Zero couldn't have survived.\nBut what if it wasn't too late?\n\n65\nHe took another deep breath. Think about this, he told himself, but there wasn't time\nto think. He flung open the door to the truck and climbed quickly inside.\n\"Hey!\" shouted Mr. Sir.\nHe turned the key and stepped on the gas pedal. The engine revved.\nThe truck didn't move.\nHe pressed the pedal to the floor. The engine roared, but the truck was motionless.\nMr. Sir came running around the side of the truck. The door was still open.\n\"Put it in gear!\" shouted Twitch.\nThe gear shift was on the floor next to the seat. Stanley pulled the lever back until\nthe arrow pointed to the letter D, for Drive.\nThe truck lurched forward. Stanley jerked back against the seat and tightly gripped\nthe wheel as the truck accelerated. His foot was pressed to the floor.\nThe truck went faster and faster across the dry lake bed. It bounced over a pile of\ndirt. Suddenly Stanley was slammed forward, then instantly backward as an airbag\nexploded in his face. He fell out of the open door and onto the ground.\nHe had driven straight into a hole.\nHe lay on the dirt staring at the truck, which stuck lopsided into the ground. He\nsighed. He couldn't blame his\nno-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather this time. This time it was his\nown fault, one hundred percent. He had probably just done the stupidest thing he had\never done in his short and miserable life.\nHe managed to get to his feet. He was sore but didn't think he had broken any bones.\nHe glanced back at Mr. Sir, who remained where he was, staring at Stanley.\nHe ran. His canteen was strapped around his neck. It banged against his chest as he\nran, and every time it hit against him, it reminded him that it was empty, empty, empty.\n\n33\nHe slowed to a walk. As far as he could tell, nobody was chasing him. He could hear\nvoices coming from back by the truck but couldn't make out the words. Occasionally\nhe'd hear the revving of the engine, but the truck wasn't going anywhere anytime soon.\nHe headed in what he thought was the direction of Big Thumb. He couldn't see it\nthrough the haze.\nWalking helped calm him down and allowed him to think clearly. He doubted he\ncould make it to Big Thumb, and with no water in his canteen, he didn't want to risk his\nlife on the hope that he'd find refuge there. He'd have to return to camp. He knew that.\nBut he was in no hurry. It would be better to return later, after everyone had a chance to\ncalm down. And as long as he'd come this far, he might as well look for Zero.\nHe decided he would walk as long as he could, until he was too weak to go any\nfarther, then he'd turn around and go back.\nHe smiled as he realized that wouldn't quite work. He would only go\nhalfway\u2014 halfway as far as he thought he could go, so that he'd still have the strength to\n\n66\nreturn. Then he'd have to make a deal with the Warden, tell her where he found Kate\nBarlow's lipstick tube, and beg for mercy.\nHe was surprised by how far out the holes extended. He couldn't even see the camp\ncompound anymore, but he still kept passing holes. Just when he thought he'd passed\nthe last hole, he'd come across another cluster of them, a little farther away.\nBack at the compound, they had dug in a systematic order, row upon row, allowing\nspace for the water truck. But out here there was no system. It was as if every once in a\nwhile, in a fit of frustration, the Warden would just pick a spot at random, and say,\n\"What the hell, dig here.\" It was like trying to guess the winning numbers in a lottery.\nStanley found himself looking down into each hole he passed. He didn't admit to\nhimself what he was looking for.\nAfter more than an hour had gone by, he thought he had surely seen the last hole,\nbut then off to the left he saw another cluster of them. He didn't actually see the holes.\nHe saw the mounds of dirt that surrounded them.\nHe stepped over the mounds and looked into the first hole. His heart stopped.\nDown at the bottom was a family of yellow-spotted lizards. Their large red eyes\nlooked up at him.\nHe leapt back over the mound and ran.\nHe didn't know if they were chasing after him. He thought he might have seen one\nleap out of the hole.\nHe ran until he couldn't run any farther, then collapsed. They hadn't come after him.\nHe sat there awhile and caught his breath. As he got back to his feet, he thought he\nnoticed something on the ground, maybe fifty yards away. It didn't look like much,\nmaybe just a big rock, but in a land of nothingness, any little thing seemed unusual.\nHe walked slowly toward it. The encounter with the lizards had made him very\ncautious.\nIt turned out to be an empty sack of sunflower seeds. He wondered if it was the\nsame one Magnet had stolen from Mr. Sir, although that didn't seem likely.\nHe turned it inside out and found one seed stuck to the burlap.\nLunch.\n\n34\nThe sun was almost directly overhead. He figured he could walk for no more than\nanother hour, maybe two, before he had to turn back.\nIt seemed pointless. He could see there was nothing ahead of him. Nothing but\nemptiness. He was hot, tired, hungry, and, most of all, thirsty. Maybe he should just\nturn around now. Maybe he'd already gone halfway and didn't know it.\nThen, looking around, he saw a pool of water less than a hundred yards away from\nwhere he was standing. He closed his eyes and opened them to make sure he wasn't\nimagining it. The pool was still there.\nHe hurried toward it. The pool hurried away from him, moving as he moved,\nstopping when he stopped.\n\n67\nThere wasn't any water. It was a mirage caused by the shimmering waves of heat\nrising off the dry ground.\nHe kept walking. He still carried the empty sack of sunflower seeds. He didn't know\nif he might find something to put in it.\nAfter a while he thought he could make out the shape of the mountains through the\nhaze. At first he wasn't sure if this was another kind of mirage, but the farther he walked,\nthe clearer they came into a view. Almost straight ahead of him, he could see what\nlooked like a fist, with its thumb sticking up.\nHe didn't know how far away it was. Five miles? Fifty miles? One thing was certain.\nIt was more than halfway.\nHe kept walking toward it, although he didn't know why. He knew he'd have to turn\naround before he got there. But every time he looked at it, it seemed to encourage him,\ngiving him the thumbs-up sign.\nAs he continued walking, he became aware of a large object on the lake. He couldn't\ntell what it was, or even if it was natural or man-made. It looked a little like a fallen tree,\nalthough it didn't seem likely that a tree would grow here. More likely, it was a ridge of\ndirt or rocks.\nThe object, whatever it was, was not on the way to Big Thumb but off to the right.\nHe tried to decide whether to go to it or continue toward Big Thumb. Or maybe just turn\naround.\nThere was no point in heading toward Big Thumb, he decided. He would never\nmake it. For all he knew it was like chasing the moon. But he could make it to the\nmysterious object.\nHe changed directions. He doubted it was anything, but the fact that there was\nsomething in the middle of all this nothing made it hard for him to pass up. He decided\nto make the object his halfway point, and he hoped he hadn't already gone too far.\nHe laughed to himself when he saw what it was. It was a boat\u2014 or part of a boat\nanyway. It struck him as funny to see a boat in the middle of this dry and barren\nwasteland. But after all, he realized, this was once a lake.\nThe boat lay upside down, half buried in the dirt.\nSomeone may have drowned here, he thought grimly\u2014 at the same spot where he\ncould very well die of thirst.\nThe name of the boat had been painted on the back. The upside-down red letters\nwere peeled and faded, but Stanley could still read the name: Mary Lou.\nOn one side of the boat there was a pile of dirt and then a tunnel leading down below\nthe boat. The tunnel looked big enough for a good-sized animal to crawl through.\nHe heard a noise. Something stirred under the boat.\nIt was coming out.\n\"Hey!\" Stanley shouted, hoping to scare it back inside. His mouth was very dry, and\nit was hard to shout very loudly.\n\"Hey,\" the thing answered weakly.\nThen a dark hand and an orange sleeve reached up out of the tunnel.\n\n68\n\n35\nZero's face looked like a jack-o'-lantern that had been left out too many days past\nHalloween\u2014 half rotten, with sunken eyes and a drooping smile. \"Is that water?\" he\nasked. His voice was weak and raspy. His lips were so pale they were almost white, and\nhis tongue seemed to flop around uselessly in his mouth as he spoke, as if it kept getting\nin the way.\n\"It's empty,\" said Stanley. He stared at Zero, not quite believing that he was real. \"I\ntried to bring you the whole water truck, but,\" he smiled sheepishly, \"I drove it into a\nhole. I can't believe you're . . .\"\n\"Me neither,\" said Zero.\n\"C'mon, we got to get back to camp.\"\nZero shook his head. \"I'm not going back.\"\n\"You have to. We both have to.\"\n\"You want some sploosh?\" Zero asked.\n\"What?\"\nZero shaded his eyes with his forearm. \"It's cooler under the boat,\" he said.\nStanley watched Zero crawl back through his hole. It was a miracle he was still\nalive, but Stanley knew he would have to get him back to camp soon, even if he had to\ncarry him.\nHe crawled after him, and was just able to squeeze his body through the hole. He\nnever would have fit when he first came to Camp Green Lake. He'd lost a lot of weight.\nAs he pulled himself through, his leg struck something sharp and hard. It was a\nshovel. For a second Stanley wondered how it got there, but then remembered that Zero\nhad taken it with him after striking Mr. Pendanski.\nIt was cooler under the boat, which was half buried in the dirt. There were enough\ncracks and holes in the bottom of the boat, now the roof, to provide light and ventilation.\nHe could see empty jars scattered about.\nZero held a jar in his hand and grunted as he tried to unscrew the lid.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"Sploosh!\" His voice was strained as he worked on the jar. \"That's what I call it.\nThey were buried under the boat.\"\nHe still couldn't get the lid off. \"I found sixteen jars. Here, hand me the shovel.\"\nStanley didn't have a lot of room to move. He reached behind him, grabbed the\nwooden end of the shovel, and held it out to Zero, blade first.\n\"Sometimes you just have to . . .\" Zero said, then he hit the jar against the blade of\nthe shovel, breaking the top of the jar clean off. He quickly brought the jar to his mouth\nand licked the sploosh off the jagged edges before it spilled.\n\"Careful,\" Stanley warned.\nZero picked up the cracked lid and licked the sploosh off that as well. Then he\nhanded the broken jar to Stanley. \"Drink some.\"\n\n69\nStanley held it in his hand and stared at it a moment. He was afraid of the broken\nglass. He was also afraid of the sploosh. It looked like mud. Whatever it was, he\nrealized, it must have been in the boat when the boat sank. That meant it was probably\nover a hundred years old. Who knew what kind of bacteria might be living in it?\n\"It's good,\" said Zero, encouraging him.\nHe wondered if Zero had heard of bacteria. He raised the jar to his mouth and\ncarefully took a sip.\nIt was a warm, bubbly, mushy nectar, sweet and tangy. It felt like heaven as it\nflowed over his dry mouth and down his parched throat. He thought it might have been\nsome kind of fruit at some time, perhaps peaches.\nZero smiled at him. \"I told you it was good.\"\nStanley didn't want to drink too much, but it was too good to resist. They passed the\njar back and forth until it was empty. \"How many are left?\" he asked.\n\"None,\" said Zero.\nStanley's mouth dropped. \"Now I have to take you back,\" he said.\n\"I'm not digging any more holes,\" said Zero.\n\"They won't make you dig,\" Stanley promised. \"They'll probably send you to a\nhospital, like Barf Bag.\"\n\"Barf Bag stepped on a rattlesnake,\" said Zero.\nStanley remembered how he'd almost done the same. \"I guess he didn't hear the\nrattle.\"\n\"He did it on purpose,\" said Zero.\n\"You think?\"\n\"He took off his shoe and sock first.\"\nStanley shivered as he tried to imagine it.\n\"What's Mar-ya Luh-oh-oo?\" asked Zero.\n\"What?\"\nZero concentrated hard. \"Mar ya, Luh oh oo.\"\n\"I have no idea.\"\n\"I'll show you,\" said Zero. He crawled hack out from under the boat.\nStanley followed. Back outside, he had to shield his eyes from the brightness.\nZero walked around to the back of the boat and pointed to the upside-down letters.\n\"Mm-ar-yuh. Luh-oh-oo.\"\nStanley smiled. \"Mary Lou. It's the name of the boat.\"\n\"Mary Lou,\" Zero repeated, studying the letters. \"I thought 'y' made the 'yuh'\nsound.\"\n\"It does,\" said Stanley. \"But not when it's at the end of a word. Sometimes 'y' is a\nvowel and sometimes it's a consonant.\"\nZero suddenly groaned. He grabbed his stomach and bent over.\n\"Are you all right?\"\nZero dropped to the ground. He lay on his side, with his knees pulled up to his chest.\nHe continued to groan.\n\n70\nStanley watched helplessly. He wondered if it was the sploosh. He looked back\ntoward Camp Green Lake. At least he thought it was the direction of Camp Green Lake.\nHe wasn't entirely sure.\nZero stopped moaning, and his body slowly unbent.\n\"I'm taking you back,\" said Stanley.\nZero managed to sit up. He took several deep breaths.\n\"Look, I got a plan so you won't get in trouble,\" Stanley assured him. \"Remember\nwhen I found the gold tube. Remember, I gave it to X-Ray, and the Warden went crazy\nmaking us dig where she thought X-Ray found it. I think if I tell the Warden where I\nreally found it, I think she'll let us off.\"\n\"I'm not going back,\" said Zero.\n\"You've got nowhere else to go,\" said Stanley.\nZero said nothing.\n\"You'll die out here,\" said Stanley.\n\"Then I'll die out here.\"\nStanley didn't know what to do. He had come to rescue Zero and instead drank the\nlast of his sploosh. He looked off into the distance. \"I want you to look at something.\"\n\"I'm not\u2014 \"\n\"I just want you to look at that mountain up there. See the one that has something\nsticking up out of it?\"\n\"Yeah, I think.\"\n\"What does it look like to you? Does it look like anything?\"\nZero said nothing.\nBut as he studied the mountain, his right hand slowly formed into a fist. He raised\nhis thumb. His eyes went from the mountain, to his hand, then back to the mountain.\n\n36\nThey put four of the unbroken jars in the burlap sack, in case they might be able to\nuse them. Stanley carried the sack. Zero held the shovel.\n\"I should warn you,\" Stanley said. \"I'm not exactly the luckiest guy in the world.\"\nZero wasn't worried. \"When you spend your whole life living in a hole,\" he said,\n\"the only way you can go is up.\"\nThey gave each other the thumbs-up sign, then headed out.\nIt was the hottest part of the day. Stanley's empty-empty-empty canteen was still\nstrapped around his neck. He thought back to the water truck, and wished he'd at least\nstopped and filled his canteen before running off.\nThey hadn't gone very far before Zero had another attack. He clutched his stomach\nas he let himself fall to the ground.\nStanley could only wait for it to pass. The sploosh had saved Zero's life, but it was\nnow destroying him from the inside. He wondered how long it would be before he, too,\nfelt the effects.\n\n71\nHe looked at Big Thumb. It didn't seem any closer than when they first started out.\nZero took a deep breath and managed to sit up.\n\"Can you walk?\" Stanley asked him.\n\"Just give me a second,\" Zero said. He took another breath, then, using the shovel,\npulled himself back to his feet. He gave Stanley the thumbs-up sign and they continued.\nSometimes Stanley would try to go for a long while without looking at Big Thumb.\nHe'd make a mental snapshot of how it looked, then wait maybe ten minutes before\nlooking at it again, to see if it seemed closer.\nIt never did. It was like chasing the moon.\nAnd if they ever reached it, he realized, then they'd still have to climb it.\n\"I wonder who she was,\" said Zero.\n\"Who?\"\n\"Mary Lou,\" said Zero.\nStanley smiled. \"I guess she was once a real person on a real lake. It's hard to\nimagine.\"\n\"I bet she was pretty,\" said Zero. \"Somebody must have loved her a lot, to name a\nboat after her.\"\n\"Yeah,\" said Stanley. \"I bet she looked great in a bathing suit, sitting in the boat\nwhile her boyfriend rowed.\"\nZero used the shovel as a third leg. Two legs weren't enough to keep him up. \"I got\nto stop and rest,\" he said after a while.\nStanley looked at Big Thumb. It still didn't look any closer. He was afraid if Zero\nstopped, he might never get started again. \"We're almost there,\" he said.\nHe wondered which was closer: Camp Green Lake or Big Thumb?\n\"I really have to sit down.\"\n\"Just see if you can go a little\u2014 \"\nZero collapsed. The shovel stayed up a fraction of a second longer, perfectly\nbalanced on the tip of the blade, then it fell next to him.\nZero knelt, bent over with his head on the ground. Stanley could hear a very low\nmoaning sound coming from him. He looked at the shovel and couldn't help but think\nthat he might need it to dig a grave. Zero's last hole.\nAnd who will dig a grave for me? he thought.\nBut Zero did get up, once again flashing thumbs-up.\n\"Give me some words,\" he said weakly.\nIt took Stanley a few seconds to realize what he meant. Then he smiled and said,\n\"R-u-n.\"\nZero sounded it out to himself. \"Rr-un, run. Run.\"\n\"Good. F-u-n.\"\n\"Fffun.\"\nThe spelling seemed to help Zero. It gave him something to concentrate on besides\nhis pain and weakness.\nIt distracted Stanley as well. The next time he looked up at Big Thumb, it really did\nseem closer.\n\n72\nThey quit spelling words when it hurt too much to talk. Stanley's throat was dry. He\nwas weak and exhausted, yet as bad as he felt, he knew that Zero felt ten times worse.\nAs long as Zero could keep going, he could keep going, too.\nIt was possible, he thought, he hoped, that he didn't get any of the bad bacteria. Zero\nhadn't been able to unscrew the lid. Maybe the bad germs couldn't get in, either. Maybe\nthe bacteria were only in the jars which opened easily, the ones he was now carrying in\nhis sack.\nWhat scared Stanley the most about dying wasn't his actual death. He figured he\ncould handle the pain. It wouldn't be much worse than what he felt now. In fact, maybe\nat the moment of his death he would be too weak to feel pain. Death would be a relief.\nWhat worried him the most was the thought of his parents not knowing what happened\nto him, not knowing whether he was dead or alive. He hated to imagine what it would\nbe like for his mother and father, day after day, month after month, not knowing, living\non false hope. For him, at least, it would be over. For his parents, the pain would never\nend.\nHe wondered if the Warden would send out a search party to look for him. It didn't\nseem likely. She didn't send anyone to look for Zero. But no one cared about Zero. They\nsimply destroyed his files.\nBut Stanley had a family. She couldn't pretend he was never there. He wondered\nwhat she would tell them. And when?\n\"What do you think's up there?\" Zero asked.\nStanley looked to the top of Big Thumb. \"Oh, probably an Italian restaurant,\" he\nsaid.\nZero managed to laugh.\n\"I think I'll get a pepperoni pizza and a large root beer,\" said Stanley.\n\"I want an ice cream sundae,\" said Zero. \"With nuts and whipped cream, and\nbananas, and hot fudge.\"\nThe sun was almost directly in front of them. The thumb pointed up toward it.\nThey came to the end of the lake. Huge white stone cliffs rose up before them.\nUnlike the eastern shore, where Camp Green Lake was situated, the western shore\ndid not slope down gradually. It was as if they had been walking across the flat bottom\nof a giant frying pan, and now they had to somehow climb up out of it.\nThey could no longer see Big Thumb. The cliffs blocked their view. The cliffs also\nblocked out the sun.\nZero groaned and clutched his stomach, but he remained standing. \"I'm all right,\" he\nwhispered.\nStanley saw a rut, about a foot wide and six inches deep, running down a cliff. On\neither side of the rut were a series of ledges. \"Let's try there,\" he said.\nIt looked to be about a fifty-foot climb, straight up.\nStanley still managed to hold the sack of jars in his left hand as he slowly moved up,\nfrom ledge to ledge, crisscrossing the rut. At times he had to use the side of the rut for\nsupport, in order to make it to the next ledge.\n\n73\nZero stayed with him, somehow. His frail body trembled terribly as he climbed the\nstone wall.\nSome of the ledges were wide enough to sit on. Others stuck out no more than a few\ninches\u2014 just enough for a quick step. Stanley stopped about two-thirds of the way up,\non a fairly wide ledge. Zero came up alongside him.\n\"You okay?\" Stanley asked.\nZero gave the thumbs-up sign. Stanley did the same.\nHe looked above him. He wasn't sure how he'd get to the next ledge. It was three or\nfour feet above his head, and he didn't see any footholds. He was afraid to look down.\n\"Give me a boost,\" said Zero. \"Then I'll pull you up with the shovel.\"\n\"You won't be able to pull me up,\" said Stanley.\n\"Yes, I will,\" said Zero.\nStanley cupped his hands together, and Zero stepped on his interwoven fingers. He\nwas able to lift Zero high enough for him to grab the protruding slab of rock. Stanley\ncontinued to help him from below as Zero pulled himself onto the ledge.\nWhile Zero was getting himself situated up there, Stanley ' attached the sack to the\nshovel by poking a hole through the burlap. He held it up to Zero.\nZero first grabbed hold of the sack, then the shovel. He set the shovel so that half the\nblade was supported by the rock slab. The wooden shaft hung down toward Stanley.\n\"Okay,\" he said.\nStanley doubted this would work. It was one thing for him to lift Zero, who was half\nhis weight. It was quite another for Zero to try to pull him up.\nStanley grabbed hold of the shovel as he climbed up the rock wall, using the sides of\nthe rut to help support him. His hands moved one over the other, up the shaft of the\nshovel.\nHe felt Zero's hand clasp his wrist.\nHe let go of the shaft with one hand and grabbed the top of the ledge.\nHe gathered his strength and for a brief second seemed to defy gravity as he took a\nquick step up the wall and, with Zero's help, pulled himself the rest of the way over the\nledge.\nHe caught his breath. There was no way he could have done that a few months ago.\nHe noticed a large spot of blood on his wrist. It took him a moment to realize that it\nwas Zero's blood.\nZero had deep gashes in both hands. He had held on to the metal blade of the shovel,\nkeeping it in place, as Stanley climbed.\nZero brought his hands to his mouth and sucked up his blood.\nOne of the glass jars had broken in the sack. They decided to save the pieces. They\nmight need to make a knife or something.\nThey rested briefly, then continued on up. It was a fairly easy climb the rest of the\nway.\nWhen they reached flat ground, Stanley looked up to see the sun, a fiery ball\nbalancing on top of Big Thumb. God was twirling a basketball.\nSoon they were walking in the long thin shadow of the thumb.\n\n74\n\n37\n\"We're almost there,\" said Stanley. He could see the base of the mountain.\nNow that they really were almost there, it scared him. Big Thumb was his only hope.\nIf there was no water, no refuge, then they'd have nothing, not even hope.\nThere was no exact place where the flat land stopped and the mountain began. The\nground got steeper and steeper, and then there was no doubt that they were heading up\nthe mountain.\nStanley could no longer see Big Thumb. The slope of the mountain was in the way.\nIt became too steep to go straight up. Instead they zigzagged back and forth,\nincreasing their altitude by small increments every time they changed directions.\nPatches of weeds dotted the mountainside. They walked from one patch to another,\nusing the weeds as footholds. As they got higher, the weeds got thicker. Many had\nthorns, and they had to be careful walking through them.\nStanley would have liked to stop and rest, but he was afraid they'd never get started\nagain. As long as Zero could keep going, he could keep going, too. Besides, he knew\nthey didn't have much daylight left.\nAs the sky darkened, bugs began appearing above the weed patches. A swarm of\ngnats hovered around them, attracted by their sweat. Neither Stanley nor Zero had the\nstrength to try to swat at them.\n\"How are you doing?\" Stanley asked.\nZero pointed thumbs up. Then he said, \"If a gnat lands on me, it will knock me\nover.\"\nStanley gave him some more words. \"B-u-g-s,\" he spelled.\nZero concentrated hard, then said, \"Boogs.\"\nStanley laughed.\nA wide smile spread across Zero's sick and weary face as well. \"Bugs,\" he said.\n\"Good,\" said Stanley. \"Remember, it's a short 'u' if there's no 'e' at the end. \"Okay,\nhere's a hard one. How about, l-u-n-c-h?\"\n\"Luh\u2014 Luh-un\u2014 \" Suddenly, Zero made a horrible, wrenching noise as he doubled\nover and grabbed his stomach. His frail body shook violently, and he threw up,\nemptying his stomach of the sploosh.\nHe leaned on his knees and took several deep breaths. Then he straightened up and\ncontinued going.\nThe swarm of gnats stayed behind, preferring the contents of Zero's stomach to the\nsweat on the boys' faces.\nStanley didn't give him any more words, thinking that he needed to save his strength.\nBut about ten or fifteen minutes later, Zero said, \"Lunch.\"\nAs they climbed higher, the patches of weeds grew thicker, and they had to be\ncareful not to get their feet tangled in thorny vines. Stanley suddenly realized\nsomething. There hadn't been any weeds on the lake.\n\"Weeds and bugs,\" he said. \"There's got to be water around somewhere. We must\nbe getting close.\"\n\n75\nA wide clown-like smile spread across Zero's face. He flashed the thumbs-up sign,\nthen fell.\nHe didn't get up. Stanley bent over him. \"C'mon, Zero,\" he urged. \"We're getting\nclose. C'mon, Hector. Weeds and bugs. Weeds and boogs.\"\nStanley shook him. \"I've already ordered your hot fudge sundae,\" he said. \"They're\nmaking it right now.\"\nZero said nothing.\n\n38\nStanley took hold of Zero's forearms and pulled him upright. Then he stooped down\nand let Zero fall over his right shoulder. He stood up, lifting Zero's worn-out body off\nthe ground.\nHe left the shovel and sack of jars behind as he continued up the mountain. Zero's\nlegs dangled in front of him.\nStanley couldn't see his feet, which made it difficult to walk through the tangled\npatches of weeds and vines. He concentrated on one step at a time, carefully raising and\nsetting down each foot. He thought only about each step, and not the impossible task\nthat lay before him.\nHigher and higher he climbed. His strength came from somewhere deep inside\nhimself and also seemed to come from the outside as well. After focusing on Big\nThumb for so long, it was as if the rock had absorbed his energy and now acted like a\nkind of giant magnet pulling him toward it.\nAfter a while he became aware of a foul odor. At first he thought it came from Zero,\nbut it seemed to be in the air, hanging heavy all around him.\nHe also noticed that the ground wasn't as steep anymore. As the ground flattened, a\nhuge stone precipice rose up ahead of him, just barely visible in the moonlight. It\nseemed to grow bigger with each step he took.\nIt no longer resembled a thumb.\nAnd he knew he'd never be able to climb it.\nAround him, the smell became stronger. It was the bitter smell of despair.\nEven if he could somehow climb Big Thumb, he knew he wouldn't find water. How\ncould there be water at the top of a giant rock? The weeds and bugs survived only by an\noccasional rainstorm, like the one he had seen from camp.\nStill, he continued toward it. If nothing else, he wanted to at least reach the Thumb.\nHe never made it.\nHis feet slipped out from under him. Zero's head knocked against the back of his\nshoulder as he fell and tumbled into a small muddy gully.\nAs he lay face down in the muddy ditch, he didn't know if he'd ever get up again. He\ndidn't know if he'd even try. Had he come all this way just to . . . You need water to\nmake mud!\nHe crawled along the gully in the direction that seemed the muddiest. The ground\nbecame gloppier. The mud splashed up as he slapped the ground.\n\n76\nUsing both hands, he dug a hole in the soggy soil. It was too dark to see, but he\nthought he could feel a tiny pool of water at the bottom of his hole. He stuck his head in\nthe hole and licked the dirt.\nHe dug deeper, and as he did so, more water seemed to fill the hole. He couldn't see\nit, but he could feel it\u2014 first with his fingers, then with his tongue.\nHe dug until he had a hole that was about as deep as his arm was long. There was\nenough water for him to scoop out with his hands and drop on Zero's face.\nZero's eyes remained closed. But his tongue poked out between his lips, searching\nout the droplets.\nStanley dragged Zero closer to the hole. He dug, then scooped some more water and\nlet it pour out of his hands into Zero's mouth.\nAs he continued to widen his hole, his hand came across a smooth, round object. It\nwas too smooth and too round to be a rock.\nHe wiped the dirt off of it and realized it was an onion.\nHe bit into it without peeling it. The hot bitter juice burst into his mouth. He could\nfeel it all the way up to his eyes. And when he swallowed, he felt its warmth move down\nhis throat and into his stomach.\nHe only ate half. He gave the other half to Zero.\n\"Here, eat this.\"\n\"What is it?\" Zero whispered.\n\"A hot fudge sundae.\"\n\n39\nStanley awoke in a meadow, looking up at the giant rock tower. It was layered and\nstreaked with different shades of red, burnt orange, brown, and tan. It must have been\nover a hundred feet tall.\nStanley lay awhile, just looking at it. He didn't have the strength to get up. It felt like\nthe insides of his mouth and throat were coated with sand.\nAnd no wonder. When he rolled over he saw the water hole. It was about two and a\nhalf feet deep and over three feet wide. At the bottom lay no more than two inches of\nvery brown water.\nHis hands and fingers were sore from digging, especially under his fingernails. He\nscooped some dirty water into his mouth, then swished it around, trying to filter it with\nhis teeth.\nZero moaned.\nStanley started to say something to him, but no words came out of his mouth, and he\nhad to try again. \"How you doing?\" It hurt to talk.\n\"Not good,\" Zero said quietly. With great effort, he rolled over, raised himself to his\nknees, and crawled to the water hole. He lowered his head into it and lapped up some\nwater.\nThen he jerked back, clutched his knees to his chest, and rolled to his side. His body\nshook violently.\n\n77\nStanley thought about going back down the mountain to look for the shovel, so he\ncould make the water hole deeper. Maybe that would give them cleaner water. They\ncould use the jars as drinking glasses.\nBut he didn't think he had the strength to go down, let alone make it back up again.\nAnd he didn't know where to look.\nHe struggled to his feet. He was in a field of greenish white flowers that seemed to\nextend all the way around Big Thumb.\nHe took a deep breath, then walked the last fifty yards to the giant precipice and\ntouched it.\nTag, you're it.\nThen he walked back to Zero and the water hole. On the way he picked one of the\nflowers. It actually wasn't one big flower, he discovered, but instead each flower was\nreally a cluster of tiny little flowers that formed a round ball. He brought it to his mouth\nbut had to spit it out.\nHe could see part of the trail he had made the night before, when he carried Zero up\nthe mountain. If he was going to head back down and look for the shovel, he realized,\nhe should do it soon, while the trail was fresh. But he didn't want to leave Zero. He was\nafraid Zero might die while he was gone.\nZero was still lying doubled over on his side. \"I got to tell you something,\" he said\nwith a groan.\n\"Don't talk,\" said Stanley. \"Save your strength.\"\n\"No, listen,\" Zero insisted, then he closed his eyes as his face twisted with pain.\n\"I'm listening,\" Stanley whispered.\n\"I took your shoes,\" Zero said.\nStanley didn't know what he was talking about. His shoes were on his feet. \"That's\nall right,\" he said. \"Just rest now.\"\n\"It's all my fault,\" said Zero.\n\"It's nobody's fault,\" said Stanley.\n\"I didn't know,\" Zero said.\n\"That's okay,\" Stanley said. \"Just rest.\"\nZero closed his eyes. But then again he said, \"I didn't know about the shoes.\"\n\"What shoes?\"\n\"From the shelter.\"\nIt took a moment for Stanley to comprehend. \"Clyde Livingston's shoes?\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Zero.\nStanley stared at him. It was impossible. Zero was delirious.\nZero's \"confession\" seemed to bring him some relief. The muscles in his face\nrelaxed. As he drifted into sleep, Stanley softly sang him the song that had been in his\nfamily for generations.\n\"If only, if only,\" the woodpecker sighs,\n\"The bark on the tree was just a little bit softer.\"\nWhile the wolf waits below, hungry and lonely,\nHe cries to the moo\u2014 oo\u2014 oon,\n\n78\n\n\"If only, if only.\"\n\n40\nWhen Stanley found the onion the night before, he didn't question how it had come\nto be there. He ate it gratefully. But now as he sat gazing at Big Thumb and the meadow\nfull of flowers, he couldn't help but wonder about it.\nIf there was one wild onion, there could be more.\nHe intertwined his fingers and tried to rub out the pain. Then he bent down and dug\nup another flower, this time pulling up the entire plant, including the root.\n\"Onions! Fresh, hot, sweet onions,\" Sam called as Mary Lou pulled the cart down\nMain Street. \"Eight cents a dozen.\"\nIt was a beautiful spring morning. The sky was painted pale blue and pink\u2014 the\nsame color as the lake and the peach trees along its shore.\nMrs. Gladys Tennyson was wearing just her nightgown and robe as she came\nrunning down the street after Sam. Mrs. Tennyson was normally a very proper woman\nwho never went out in public without dressing up in fine clothes and a hat. So it was\nquite surprising to the people of Green Lake to see her running past them.\n\"Sam!\" she shouted.\n\"Whoa, Mary Lou,\" said Sam, stopping his mule and cart. \"G'morning, Mrs.\nTennyson,\" he said. \"How's little Becca doing?\"\nGladys Tennyson was all smiles. \"I think she's going to be all right. The fever broke\nabout an hour ago. Thanks to you.\"\n\"I'm sure the good Lord and Doc Hawthorn deserve most of the credit.\"\n\"The Good Lord, yes,\" agreed Mrs. Tennyson, \"but not Dr. Hawthorn. That quack\nwanted to put leeches on her stomach! Leeches! My word! He said they would suck out\nthe bad blood. Now you tell me. How would a leech know good blood from bad\nblood?\"\n\"I wouldn't know,\" said Sam.\n\"It was your onion tonic,\" said Mrs. Tennyson. \"That's what saved her.\"\nOther townspeople made their way to the cart. \"Good morning, Gladys,\" said Hattie\nParker. \"Don't you look lovely this morning.\"\nSeveral people snickered.\n\"Good morning, Hattie,\" Mrs. Tennyson replied.\n\"Does your husband know you're parading about in your bed clothes?\" Hattie\nasked.\nThere were more snickers.\n\"My husband knows exactly where I am and how I am dressed, thank you,\" said\nMrs. Tennyson. \"We have both been up all night and half the morning with Rebecca.\nShe almost died from stomach sickness. It seems she ate some bad meat.\"\nHattie's face flushed. Her husband, Jim Parker, was the butcher.\n\n79\n\"It made my husband and me sick as well,\" said Mrs. Tennyson, \"but it nearly killed\nBecca, what with her being so young. Sam saved her life.\"\n\"It wasn't me,\" said Sam. \"It was the onions.\"\n\"I'm glad Becca's all right,\" Hattie said contritely.\n\"I keep telling Jim he needs to wash his knives,\" said Mr. Pike, who owned the\ngeneral store.\nHattie Parker excused herself, then turned and quickly walked away.\n\"Tell Becca that when she feels up to it to come by the store for a piece of candy,\"\nsaid Mr. Pike.\n\"Thank you, I'll do that.\"\nBefore returning home, Mrs. Tennyson bought a dozen onions from Sam. She gave\nhim a dime and told him to keep the change.\n\"I don't take charity,\" Sam told her. \"But if you want to buy a few extra onions for\nMary Lou, I'm sure she'd appreciate it.\"\n\"All right then,\" said Mrs. Tennyson, \"give me my change in onions.\"\nSam gave Mrs. Tennyson an additional three onions, and she fed them one at a time\nto Mary Lou. She laughed as the old donkey ate them out of her hand.\nStanley and Zero slept off and on for the next two days, ate onions, all they wanted,\nand splashed dirty water into their mouths. In the late afternoon Big Thumb gave them\nshade. Stanley tried to make the hole deeper, but he really needed the shovel. His efforts\njust seemed to stir up the mud and make the water dirtier.\nZero was sleeping. He was still very sick and weak, but the sleep and the onions\nseemed to be doing him some good. Stanley was no longer afraid that he would die\nsoon. Still, he didn't want to go for the shovel while Zero was asleep. He didn't want\nhim to wake up and think he'd been deserted.\nHe waited for Zero to open his eyes.\n\"I think I'll go look for the shovel,\" Stanley said.\n\"I'll wait here,\" Zero said feebly, as if he had any other choice.\nStanley headed down the mountain. The sleep and the onions had done him a lot of\ngood as well. He felt strong.\nIt was fairly easy to follow the trail he had made two days earlier. There were a few\nplaces where he wasn't sure he was going the right way, but it just took a little bit of\nsearching before he found the trail again.\nHe went quite a ways down the mountain but still didn't find the shovel. He looked\nback up toward the top of the mountain. He must have walked right past it, he thought.\nThere was no way he could have carried Zero all the way up from here.\nStill, he headed downward, just in case. He came to a bare spot between two large\npatches of weeds and sat down to rest. Now he had definitely gone too far, he decided.\nHe was tired out from walking down the hill. It would have been impossible to have\ncarried Zero up the hill from here, especially after walking all day with no food or water.\nThe shovel must be buried in some weeds.\n\n80\nBefore starting back up, he took one last look around in all directions. He saw a\nlarge indentation in the weeds a little farther down the mountain. It didn't seem likely\nthat the shovel could be there, but he'd already come this far.\nThere, lying in some tall weeds, he found the shovel and the sack of jars. He was\namazed. He wondered if the shovel and sack might have rolled down the hill. But none\nof the jars were broken, except the one which had broken earlier. And if they had rolled\ndown the hill, it is doubtful that he would have found the sack and shovel side by side.\nOn his way back up the mountain, Stanley had to sit down and rest several times. It\nwas a long, hard climb.\n\n41\nZero's condition continued to improve.\nStanley slowly peeled an onion. He liked eating them one layer at a time.\nThe water hole was now almost as large as the holes he had dug back at Camp\nGreen Lake. It contained almost two feet of murky water. Stanley had dug it all himself.\nZero had offered to help, but Stanley thought it better for Zero to save his strength. It\nwas a lot harder to dig in water than it was in a dry lake.\nStanley was surprised that he himself hadn't gotten sick\u2014 either from the sploosh,\nthe dirty water, or from living on onions. He used to get sick quite a lot back at home.\nBoth boys were barefoot. They had washed their socks. All their clothes were very\ndirty, but their socks were definitely the worst.\nThey didn't dip their socks into the hole, afraid to contaminate the water. Instead\nthey filled the jars and poured the water over their dirty socks.\n\"I didn't go to the homeless shelter very often,\" Zero said. \"Just if the weather was\nreally bad. I'd have to find someone to pretend to be my mom. If I'd just gone by myself,\nthey would have asked me a bunch of questions. If they'd found out I didn't have a mom,\nthey would have made me a ward of the state.\"\n\"What's a ward of the state?\"\nZero smiled. \"I don't know. But I didn't like the sound of it.\"\nStanley remembered Mr. Pendanski telling the Warden that Zero was a ward of the\nstate. He wondered if Zero knew he'd become one.\n\"I liked sleeping outside,\" said Zero. \"I used to pretend I was a Cub Scout. I always\nwanted to be a Cub Scout. I'd see them at the park in their blue uniforms.\"\n\"I was never a Cub Scout,\" said Stanley. \"I wasn't good at social stuff like that. Kids\nmade fun of me because I was fat.\"\n\"I liked the blue uniforms,\" said Zero. \"Maybe I wouldn't have liked being a Cub\nScout.\"\nStanley shrugged one shoulder.\n\"My mother was once a Girl Scout,\" said Zero.\n\"I thought you said you didn't have a mother.\"\n\"Everybody has to have a mother.\"\n\"Well, yeah, I know that.\"\n\n81\n\"She said she once won a prize for selling the most Girl Scout cookies,\" said Zero.\n\"She was real proud of that.\"\nStanley peeled off another layer of his onion.\n\"We always took what we needed,\" Zero said. \"When I was little, I didn't even\nknow it was stealing. I don't remember when I found out. But we just took what we\nneeded, never more. So when I saw the shoes on display in the shelter, I just reached in\nthe glass case and took them.\"\n\"Clyde Livingston's shoes?\" asked Stanley.\n\"I didn't know they were his. I just thought they were somebody's old shoes. It was\nbetter to take someone's old shoes, I thought, than steal a pair of new ones. I didn't know\nthey were famous. There was a sign, but of course I couldn't read it. Then, the next thing\nI know everybody's making this big deal about how the shoes are missing. It was kind\nof funny, in a way. The whole place is going crazy. There I was, wearing the shoes, and\neveryone's running around saying, 'What happened to the shoes?' 'The shoes are gone!'\nI just walked out the door. No one noticed me. When I got outside, I ran around the\ncorner and immediately took off the shoes. I put them on top of a parked car. I\nremember they smelled really bad.\"\n\"Yeah, those were them,\" said Stanley. \"Did they fit you?\"\n\"Pretty much.\"\nStanley remembered being surprised at Clyde Livingston's small shoe size.\nStanley's shoes were bigger. Clyde Livingston had small, quick feet. Stanley's feet were\nbig and slow.\n\"I should have just kept them,\" said Zero. \"I'd already made it out of the shelter and\neverything. I ended up getting arrested the next day when I tried to walk out of a shoe\nstore with a new pair of sneakers. If I had just kept those old smelly sneakers, then\nneither of us would be here right now.\"\n\n42\nZero became strong enough to help dig the hole. When he finished, it was over six\nfeet deep. He filled the bottom with rocks to help separate the water from the dirt.\nHe was still the best hole digger around.\n\"That's the last hole I will ever dig,\" he declared, throwing down the shovel.\nStanley smiled. He wished it were true, but he knew they had no choice but to\neventually return to Camp Green Lake. They couldn't live on onions forever.\nThey had been completely around Big Thumb. It was like a giant sundial. They\nfollowed the shade.\nThey were able to see out in all directions. There was no place to go. The mountain\nwas surrounded by desert.\nZero stared at Big Thumb. \"It must have a hole in it,\" he said, \"filled with water.\"\n\"You think?\"\n\"Where else could the water be coming from?\" Zero asked. \"Water doesn't run\nuphill.\"\n\n82\nStanley bit into an onion. It didn't burn his eyes or nose, and, in fact, he no longer\nnoticed a particularly strong taste.\nHe remembered when he had first carried Zero up the hill, how the air had smelled\nbitter. It was the smell of thousands of onions, growing and rotting and sprouting.\nNow he didn't smell a thing.\n\"How many onions do you think we've eaten?\" he asked.\nZero shrugged. \"I don't even know how long we've been here.\"\n\"I'd say about a week,\" said Stanley. \"And we probably each eat about twenty\nonions a day, so that's . . .\"\n\"Two hundred and eighty onions,\" said Zero.\nStanley smiled. \"I bet we really stink.\"\nTwo nights later, Stanley lay awake staring up at the star-filled sky. He was too\nhappy to fall asleep.\nHe knew he had no reason to be happy. He had heard or read somewhere that right\nbefore a person freezes to death, he suddenly feels nice and warm. He wondered if\nperhaps he was experiencing something like that.\nIt occurred to him that he couldn't remember the last time he felt happiness. It wasn't\njust being sent to Camp Green Lake that had made his life miserable. Before that he'd\nbeen unhappy at school, where he had no friends, and bullies like Derrick Dunne picked\non him. No one liked him, and the truth was, he didn't especially like himself.\nHe liked himself now.\nHe wondered if he was delirious.\nHe looked over at Zero sleeping near him. Zero's face was lit in the starlight, and\nthere was a flower petal in front of his nose that moved back and forth as he breathed. It\nreminded Stanley of something out of a cartoon. Zero breathed in, and the petal was\ndrawn up almost touching his nose. Zero breathed out, and the petal moved toward his\nchin. It stayed on Zero's face for an amazingly long time before fluttering off to the side.\nStanley considered placing it back in front of Zero's nose, but it wouldn't be the\nsame.\nIt seemed like Zero had lived at Camp Green Lake forever, but as Stanley thought\nabout it now, he realized that Zero must have gotten there no more than a month or two\nbefore him. Zero was actually arrested a day later. But Stanley's trial kept getting\ndelayed because of baseball.\nHe remembered what Zero had said a few days before. If Zero had just kept those\nshoes, then neither of them would be here right now.\nAs Stanley stared at the glittering night sky, he thought there was no place he would\nrather be. He was glad Zero put the shoes on the parked car. He was glad they fell from\nthe overpass and hit him on the head.\nWhen the shoes first fell from the sky, he remembered thinking that destiny had\nstruck him. Now, he thought so again. It was more than a coincidence. It had to be\ndestiny.\n\n83\nMaybe they wouldn't have to return to Camp Green Lake, he thought. Maybe they\ncould make it past the camp, then follow the dirt road back to civilization. They could\nfill the sack with onions, and the three jars with water. And he had his canteen as well.\nThey could refill their jars and canteen at the camp. Maybe sneak into the kitchen\nand get some food.\nHe doubted any counselors were still on guard. Everyone had to think they were\ndead. Buzzard food.\nIt would mean living the rest of his life as a fugitive. The police would always be\nafter him. At least he could call his parents and tell them he was still alive. But he\ncouldn't go visit them, in case the police were watching the apartment. Although, if\neveryone thought he was dead, they wouldn't bother to watch the apartment. He would\nhave to somehow get a new identity.\nNow, I'm really thinking crazy, he thought. He wondered if a crazy person wonders\nif he's crazy.\nBut even as he thought this, an even crazier idea kept popping into his head. He\nknew it was too crazy to even consider. Still, if he was going to be a fugitive for the rest\nof his life, it would help to have some money, perhaps a treasure chest full of money.\nYou're crazy! he told himself. Besides, just because he found a lipstick container\nwith K B on it, that didn't mean there was treasure buried there.\nIt was crazy. It was all part of his crazy feeling of happiness.\nOr maybe it was destiny.\nHe reached over and shook Zero's arm. \"Hey, Zero,\" he whispered.\n\"Huh?\" Zero muttered.\n\"Zero, wake up.\"\n\"What?\" Zero raised up his head. \"What is it?\"\n\"You want to dig one more hole?\" Stanley asked him.\n\n43\n\"We weren't always homeless,\" Zero said. \"I remember a yellow room.\"\n\"How old were you when you . . .\" Stanley started to ask, but couldn't find the right\nwords. \". . . moved out?\"\n\"I don't know. I must have been real little, because I don't remember too much. I\ndon't remember moving out. I remember standing in a crib, with my mother singing to\nme. She held my wrists and made my hands clap together. She used to sing that song to\nme. That one you sang . . . It was different, though . . .\"\nZero spoke slowly, as if searching his brain for memories and clues. \"And then later\nI know we lived on the street, but I don't know why we left the house. I'm pretty sure it\nwas a house, and not an apartment. I know my room was yellow.\"\nIt was late afternoon. They were resting in the shadow of the Thumb. They had\nspent the morning picking onions and putting them in the sack. It didn't take long, but\nlong enough so that they had to wait another day before heading down the mountain.\n\n84\nThey wanted to leave at the first hint of daylight, so they'd have plenty of time to\nmake it to Camp Green Lake before dark. Stanley wanted to be sure he could find the\nright hole. Then, they would hide by it until everyone went to sleep.\nThey would dig for as long as it seemed safe, and not a second longer. And then,\ntreasure or no treasure, they'd head up the dirt road. If it was absolutely safe, they'd try\nto steal some food and water from the camp kitchen.\n\"I'm good at sneaking in and out of places,\" Zero had said.\n\"Remember,\" Stanley had warned. \"The door to the Wreck Room squeaks.\"\nNow he lay on his back, trying to save his strength for the long days ahead. He\nwondered what happened to Zero's parents, but he didn't ask. Zero didn't like answering\nquestions. It was better to just let him talk when he felt like it.\nStanley thought about his own parents. In her last letter, his mom was worried that\nthey might be evicted from their apartment because of the smell of burning sneakers.\nThey could easily become homeless as well.\nAgain, he wondered if they'd been told that he ran away from camp. Were they told\nthat he was dead?\nAn image appeared in his head of his parents hugging each other and crying. He\ntried not to think about it.\nInstead he tried to recapture the feelings he'd had the night before\u2014 the inexplicable\nfeeling of happiness, the sense of destiny. But those feelings didn't return.\nHe just felt scared.\nThe next morning they headed down the mountain. They'd dunked their caps in the\nwater hole before putting them on their heads. Zero held the shovel, and Stanley carried\nthe sack, which was crammed with onions and the three jars of water. They left the\npieces of the broken jar on the mountain.\n\"This is where I found the shovel,\" Stanley said, pointing out a patch of weeds.\nZero turned and looked up toward the top of the mountain. \"That's a long way.\"\n\"You were light,\" Stanley said. \"You'd already thrown up everything that was\ninside your stomach.\"\nHe shifted the sack from one shoulder to the other. It was heavy. He stepped on a\nloose rock, slipped, then fell hard. The next thing he knew he was sliding down the\nsteep side of the mountain. He dropped the sack, and onions spilled around him.\nHe slid into a patch of weeds and grabbed onto a thorny vine. The vine ripped out of\nthe earth, but slowed him enough so that he was able to stop himself.\n\"Are you all right?\" Zero asked from above.\nStanley groaned as he pulled a thorn out of the palm of his hand. \"Yeah,\" he said.\nHe was all right. He was worried more about the jars of water.\nZero climbed down after him, retrieving the sack along the way. Stanley pulled\nsome thorns out of his pant legs.\nThe jars hadn't broken. The onions had protected them, like Styrofoam packing\nmaterial. \"Glad you didn't do that when you were carrying me,\" Zero said.\n\n85\nThey'd lost about a third of the onions, but recovered many of them as they\ncontinued down the mountain. When they reached the bottom, the sun was just rising\nabove the lake. They walked directly toward it.\nSoon they stood on the edge of a cliff, looking down on the dry lake bed. Stanley\nwasn't sure, but he thought he could see the remains of the Mary Lou off in the distance.\n\"You thirsty?\" Stanley asked.\n\"No,\" said Zero. \"How about you.\"\n\"No,\" Stanley lied. He didn't want to be the first one to take a drink. Although they\ndidn't mention it, it had become a kind of challenge between him and Zero.\nThey climbed down into the frying pan. It was a different spot from where they had\nclimbed up. They eased themselves down from one ledge to another, and let themselves\nslide in other places, being especially careful with the sack.\nStanley could no longer see the Mary Lou, but headed in what he thought was the\nright direction. As the sun rose, so did the familiar haze of heat and dirt.\n\"You thirsty?\" Zero asked.\n\"No,\" said Stanley.\n\"Because you have three full jars of water,\" said Zero. \"I thought maybe it was\ngetting too heavy for you. If you drink some, it will lighten your load.\"\n\"I'm not thirsty,\" said Stanley. \"But if you want a drink, I'll give you some.\"\n\"I'm not thirsty,\" said Zero. \"I was just worried about you.\"\nStanley smiled. \"I'm a camel,\" he said.\nThey walked for what seemed like a very long time, and still never came across the\nMary Lou. Stanley was pretty sure they were heading in the right direction. He\nremembered that when they left the boat, they were headed toward the setting sun. Now\nthey were headed toward the rising sun. He knew the sun didn't rise and set exactly in\nthe east and west; more southeast and southwest, but he wasn't sure how that made a\ndifference.\nHis throat felt as if it was coated with sandpaper. \"You sure you're not thirsty?\" he\nasked.\n\"Not me,\" said Zero. His voice was dry and raspy.\nWhen they did finally take a drink, they agreed to do it at the same time. Zero, who\nwas now carrying the sack, set it down and took out two jars, giving one to Stanley.\nThey decided to save the canteen for last, since it couldn't accidentally break.\n\"You know I'm not thirsty,\" Stanley said, as he unscrewed the lid. \"I'm just drinking\nso you will.\"\n\"I'm just drinking so you will,\" said Zero.\nThey clinked the jars together and, each watching the other, poured the water into\ntheir stubborn mouths.\nZero was the first to spot the Mary Lou, maybe a quarter mile away, and just a little\noff to the right. They headed for it.\nIt wasn't even noon yet when they reached the boat. They sat against the shady side\nand rested.\n\n86\n\"I don't know what happened to my mother,\" Zero said. \"She left and never came\nback.\"\nStanley peeled an onion.\n\"She couldn't always take me with her,\" Zero said. \"Sometimes she had to do things\nby herself.\"\nStanley had the feeling that Zero was explaining things to himself.\n\"She'd tell me to wait in a certain place for her. When I was real little, I had to wait\nin small areas, like on a porch step or a doorway. 'Now don't leave here until I get back,'\nshe'd say.\n\"I never liked it when she left. I had a stuffed animal, a little giraffe, and I'd hug it\nthe whole time she was gone. When I got bigger I was allowed to stay in bigger areas.\nLike, 'Stay on this block.' Or, 'Don't leave the park.' But even then, I still held Jaffy.\"\nStanley guessed that Jaffy was the name of Zero's giraffe.\n\"And then one day she didn't come back,\" Zero said. His voice sounded suddenly\nhollow. \"I waited for her at Laney Park.\"\n\"Laney Park,\" said Stanley. \"I've been there.\"\n\"You know the playscape?\" asked Zero.\n\"Yeah. I've played on it.\"\n\"I waited there for more than a month,\" said Zero. \"You know that tunnel that you\ncrawl through, between the slide and the swinging bridge? That's where I slept.\"\nThey ate four onions apiece and drank about half a jar of water. Stanley stood up\nand looked around. Everything looked the same in all directions.\n\"When I left camp, I was heading straight toward Big Thumb,\" he said. \"I saw the\nboat off to the right. So that means we have to turn a little to the left.\"\nZero was lost in thought. \"What? Okay,\" he said.\nThey headed out. It was Stanley's turn to carry the sack.\n\"Some kids had a birthday party,\" Zero said. \"I guess it was about two weeks after\nmy mother left. There was a picnic table next to the playscape and balloons were tied to\nit. The kids looked to be the same age as me. One girl said hi to me and asked me if I\nwanted to play. I wanted to, but I didn't. I knew I didn't belong at the party, even though\nit wasn't their playscape. There was this one mother who kept staring at me like I was\nsome kind of monster. Then later a boy asked me if I wanted a piece of cake, but then\nthat same mother told me, 'Go away!' and she told all the kids to stay away from me, so\nI never got the piece of cake. I ran away so fast, I forgot Jaffy.\"\n\"Did you ever find him\u2014 it?\"\nFor a moment, Zero didn't answer. Then he said, \"He wasn't real.\"\nStanley thought again about his own parents, how awful it would be for them to\nnever know if he was dead or alive. He realized that was how Zero must have felt, not\nknowing what happened to his own mother. He wondered why Zero never mentioned\nhis father.\n\"Hold on,\" Zero said, stopping abruptly. \"We're going the wrong way.\"\n\"No, this is right,\" said Stanley.\n\"You were heading toward Big Thumb when you saw the boat off to your right,\"\nsaid Zero. \"That means we should have turned right when we left the boat.\"\n\n87\n\n\"You sure?\"\nZero drew a diagram in the dirt.\nStanley still wasn't sure.\n\"We need to go this way,\" Zero said, first drawing a line on the map and then\nheading that way himself.\nStanley followed. It didn't feel right to him, but Zero seemed sure.\nSometime in the middle of the afternoon, a cloud drifted across the sky and blocked\nout the sun. It was a welcome relief. Once again, Stanley felt that destiny was on his\nside.\nZero stopped and held out his arm to stop Stanley, too.\n\"Listen,\" Zero whispered.\nStanley didn't hear anything.\nThey continued walking very quietly and Stanley began to make out the faint\nsounds of Camp Green Lake. They were still too far away to see the camp, but he could\nhear a blend of indistinct voices. As they got closer he occasionally could hear Mr. Sir's\ndistinctive bark.\nThey walked slowly and quietly, aware that sounds travel in both directions.\nThey approached a cluster of holes. \"Let's wait here, until they go in,\" said Zero.\nStanley nodded. He checked to make sure there was nothing living in it, then\nclimbed down into a hole. Zero climbed into the one next to him.\nDespite having gone the wrong way for a while, it hadn't taken them nearly as long\nas Stanley had expected. Now, they just had to wait.\nThe sun cut through the cloud, and Stanley felt its rays beating down on him. But\nsoon more clouds filled the sky, shading Stanley and his hole.\nHe waited until he was certain the last of the campers had finished for the day.\nThen he waited a little longer.\nAs quietly as possible, he and Zero climbed up out of their holes and crept toward\ncamp. Stanley held the sack in front of him, cradled in his arms, instead of over his\nshoulder, to keep the jars from clanking against each other. A wave of terror rushed\nover him when he saw the compound\u2014 the tents, the Wreck Room, the Warden's cabin\nunder the two oak trees. The fear made him dizzy. He took a breath, summoned his\ncourage, and continued.\n\"That's the one,\" he whispered, pointing out the hole where he had found the gold\ntube. It was still about fifty yards away, but Stanley was pretty sure it was the right hole.\nThere was no need to risk going any closer.\nThey climbed down into adjacent holes, and waited for the camp to fall asleep.\n\n44\nStanley tried to sleep, not knowing when he'd get the chance again. He heard the\nshowers and, later, the sounds of dinner. He heard the creaking of the Wreck Room\ndoor. His fingers drummed against the side of the hole. He heard his own heart heat.\n\n88\nHe took a drink from the canteen. He had given Zero the water jars. They each had\na good supply of onions.\nHe wasn't sure how long he remained in the hole, maybe five hours. He was\nsurprised when he heard Zero whispering for him to wake up. He didn't think he'd fallen\nasleep. If he had, he thought it must have just been for the last five minutes. Although,\nwhen he opened his eyes, he was surprised how dark it was.\nThere was only one light on at camp, in the office. The sky was cloudy, so there was\nvery little starlight. Stanley could see a sliver of a moon, which appeared and\ndisappeared among the clouds.\nHe carefully led Zero to the hole, which was hard to find in the darkness. He\nstumbled over a small pile of dirt. \"I think this is it,\" he whispered.\n\"You think?\" Zero asked.\n\"It's it,\" said Stanley, sounding more certain than he really was. He climbed down.\nZero handed him the shovel.\nStanley stuck the shovel into the dirt at the bottom of the hole and stepped on the\nback of the blade. He felt it sink beneath his weight. He scooped out some dirt and\ntossed it off to the side. Then he brought the shovel back down.\nZero watched for a while. \"I'm going to try to refill the water jars,\" he said.\nStanley took a deep breath and exhaled. \"Be careful,\" he said, then continued\ndigging.\nIt was so dark, he couldn't even see the end of his shovel. For all he knew he could\nbe digging up gold and diamonds instead of dirt. He brought each shovelful close to his\nface, to try to see if anything was there, before dumping it out of the hole.\nAs he made the hole deeper, it became harder to lift the dirt up and out. It was five\nfeet deep before he even started. He decided to use his efforts to make it wider instead.\nThis made more sense, he told himself. If Kate Barlow had buried a treasure chest,\nshe probably wouldn't have been able to dig much deeper, so why should he?\nOf course, Kate Barlow probably had a whole gang of thieves helping her.\n\"You want some breakfast?\"\nStanley jumped at the sound of Zero's voice. He hadn't heard him approach.\nZero handed down a box of cereal. Stanley carefully poured some cereal into his\nmouth. He didn't want to put his dirty hands inside the box. He nearly gagged on the\nultra-sweet taste. They were sugar-frosted flakes, and after eating nothing but onions\nfor more than a week, he had trouble adjusting to the flavor. He washed them down\nwith a swig of water.\nZero took over the digging. Stanley sifted his fingers through the fresh piles of dirt,\nin case he had missed anything. He wished he had a flashlight. A diamond no bigger\nthan a pebble would be worth thousands of dollars. Yet there was no way he'd see it.\nThey finished the water that Zero had gotten from the spigot by the showers.\nStanley said he'd go fill the jars again, but Zero insisted that he do it instead. \"No\noffense, but you make too much noise when you walk. You're too big.\"\nStanley returned to the hole. As the hole grew wider, parts of the surface kept\ncaving in. They were running out of room. To make it much wider, they would first\n\n89\nhave to move some of the surrounding dirt piles out of the way. He wondered how\nmuch time they had before the camp woke up.\n\"How's it going?\" Zero asked when he returned with the water.\nStanley shrugged one shoulder. He brought the shovel down the side of the hole,\nshaving off a slice of the dirt wall. As he did so, he felt the shovel bounce off something\nhard.\n\"What was that?\" Zero asked.\nStanley didn't know. He moved his shovel up and down the side of the hole. As the\ndirt chipped and flaked away, the hard object became more pronounced.\nIt was sticking out of the side of the hole, about a foot and a half from the bottom.\nHe felt it with his hands.\n\"What is it?\" Zero asked.\nHe could just feel a corner of it. Most of it was still buried. It had the cool, smooth\ntexture of metal. \"I think I might have found the treasure chest,\" he said. His voice was\nfilled more with astonishment than with excitement.\n\"Really?\" asked Zero.\n\"I think so,\" Stanley said.\nThe hole was wide enough for him to hold the shovel lengthwise and dig sideways\ninto the wall. He knew he had to dig very carefully. He didn't want the side of the hole\nto collapse, along with the huge pile of dirt directly above it.\nHe scraped at the dirt wall, until he exposed one entire side of the box-like object.\nHe ran his fingers over it. It felt to be about eight inches tall, and almost two feet wide.\nHe had no way of knowing how far into the earth it extended. He tried pulling it out, but\nit wouldn't budge.\nHe was afraid that the only way to get to it was to start back up at the surface, and\ndig down. They didn't have time for that.\n\"I'm going to try to dig a hole underneath it,\" he said. \"Then maybe I can pull it\ndown and slip it out.\"\n\"Go for it,\" said Zero.\nStanley jammed the shovel into the bottom edge of his hole, and carefully began to\ndig a tunnel underneath the metal object. He hoped it didn't cave in.\nOccasionally he'd stop, stoop down, and try to feel the far end of the box. But even\nwhen the tunnel was as long as his arm, he still couldn't feel the other side.\nOnce again he tried pulling it out, but it was firmly in the ground. If he pulled too\nhard, he feared, he'd cause a cave-in. He knew that when he was ready to pull it out, he\nwould have to do it quickly, before the ground above it collapsed.\nAs his tunnel grew deeper and wider\u2014 and more precarious\u2014 Stanley was able to\nfeel latches on one end of the box, and then a leather handle. It wasn't really a box. \"I\nthink it might be some kind of metal suitcase,\" he told Zero.\n\"Can you pry it loose with the shovel?\" Zero suggested.\n\"I'm afraid the side of the hole will collapse.\"\n\"You might as well give it a try,\" said Zero.\nStanley took a sip of water. \"Might as well,\" he said.\n\n90\nHe forced the tip of the shovel between the dirt and the top of the metal case and\ntried to wedge it free. He wished he could see what he was doing.\nHe worked the end of the shovel, back and forth, up and down, until he felt the\nsuitcase fall free. Then he felt the dirt come piling down on top of it.\nBut it wasn't a huge cave-in. As he knelt down in the hole, he could tell that only a\nsmall portion of the earth had collapsed.\nHe dug with his hands until he found the leather handle, and then he pulled the\nsuitcase up and out of the dirt. \"I got it!\" he exclaimed.\nIt was heavy. He handed it up to Zero.\n\"You did it,\" Zero said, taking it from him.\n\"We did it,\" said Stanley.\nHe gathered his remaining strength, and tried to pull himself up out of the hole.\nSuddenly, a bright light was shining in his face.\n\"Thank you,\" said the Warden. \"You boys have been a big help.\"\n\n45\nThe beam of the flashlight was directed away from Stanley's eyes and onto Zero,\nwho was sitting on his knees. The suitcase was on his lap.\nMr. Pendanski was holding the flashlight. Mr. Sir stood next to him with his gun\ndrawn and pointed in the same direction. Mr. Sir was barefoot and bare-chested,\nwearing only his pajama bottoms.\nThe Warden moved toward Zero. She was also in her bed clothes, wearing an\nextra-long T-shirt. Unlike Mr. Sir, however, she had on her boots.\nMr. Pendanski was the only one fully dressed. Perhaps he had been on guard duty.\nOff in the distance, Stanley could see two more flashlights bobbing toward them in\nthe darkness. He felt helpless in the hole.\n\"You boys arrived just in the nick\u2014 \" the Warden started to say. She stopped talking\nand she stopped walking. Then she slowly backed away.\nA lizard had crawled up on top of the suitcase. Its big red eyes glowed in the beam\nof the flashlight. Its mouth was open, and Stanley could see its white tongue moving in\nand out between its black teeth.\nZero sat as still as a statue.\nA second lizard crawled up over the side of the suitcase and stopped less than an\ninch away from Zero's little finger.\nStanley was afraid to look, and afraid not to. He wondered if he should try to\nscramble out of the hole before the lizards turned on him, but he didn't want to cause\nany commotion.\nThe second lizard crawled across Zero's fingers and halfway up his arm.\nIt occurred to Stanley that the lizards were probably on the suitcase when he handed\nit to Zero.\n\n91\n\"There's another one!\" gasped Mr. Pendanski. He shined the flashlight on the box of\nFrosted Flakes, which lay on its side beside Stanley's hole. A lizard was crawling out of\nit.\nThe light also illuminated Stanley's hole. He glanced downward and had to force\nhimself to suppress a scream. He was standing in a lizard nest. He felt the scream\nexplode inside him.\nHe could see six lizards. There were three on the ground, two on his left leg, and one\non his right sneaker.\nHe tried to remain very still. Something was crawling up the back of his neck.\nThree other counselors approached the area. Stanley heard one say, \"What's\ngoing\u2014 \" and then whisper, \"Oh my God.\"\n\"What do we do?\" asked Mr. Pendanski.\n\"We wait,\" said the Warden. \"It won't be very long.\"\n\"At least we'll have a body to give that woman,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\n\"She's going to ask a lot of questions,\" said Mr. Sir. \"And this time she'll have the\nA.G. with her.\"\n\"Let her ask her questions,\" said the Warden. \"Just so long as I have the suitcase, I\ndon't care what happens. Do you know how long . . .\" Her voice trailed off, then started\nup again. \"When I was little I'd watch my parents dig holes, every weekend and holiday.\nWhen I got bigger, I had to dig, too. Even on Christmas.\"\nStanley felt tiny claws dig into the side of his face as the lizard pulled itself off his\nneck and up past his chin.\n\"It won't be long now,\" the Warden said.\nStanley could hear his heart beat. Each beat told him he was still alive, at least for\none more second.\n\n46\nFive hundred seconds later, his heart was still beating.\nMr. Pendanski screamed. The lizard which had been in the cereal box was springing\ntoward him.\nMr. Sir shot it in midair.\nStanley felt the blast shatter the air around him. The lizards scurried frantically\nacross his very still body. He did not flinch. A lizard ran across his closed mouth.\nHe glanced at Zero and Zero's eyes met his. Somehow they were both still alive, at\nleast for one more second, one more heartbeat.\nMr. Sir lit a cigarette.\n\"I thought you quit,\" said one of the other counselors.\n\"Yeah, well, sometimes sunflower seeds just won't cut it.\" He took a long drag on\nhis cigarette. \"I'm going to have nightmares the rest of my life.\"\n\"Maybe we should just shoot them,\" suggested Mr. Pendanski.\n\"Who?\" asked a counselor. \"The lizards or the kids?\"\n\n92\nMr. Pendanski laughed grimly. \"The kids are going to die anyway.\" He laughed\nagain. \"At least we got plenty of graves to choose from.\"\n\"We've got time,\" said the Warden. \"I've waited this long, I can wait another\nfew . . .\" Her voice trailed off.\nStanley felt a lizard crawl in and out of his pocket.\n\"We're going to keep our story simple,\" said the Warden. \"That woman's going to\nask a lot of questions. The A.G. will most likely initiate an investigation. So this is what\nhappened: Stanley tried to run away in the night, fell in a hole, and the lizards got him.\nThat's it. We're not even going to give them Zero's body. As far as anybody knows,\nZero doesn't exist. Like Mom said, we got plenty of graves to choose from.\"\n\"Why would he run away if he knew he was getting released today?\" asked Mr.\nPendanski.\n\"Who knows? He's crazy. That was why we couldn't release him yesterday. He was\ndelirious, and we had to keep watch over him so he wouldn't hurt himself or anybody\nelse.\"\n\"She's not going to like it,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\n\"She's not going to like anything we tell her,\" said the Warden. She stared at Zero\nand at the suitcase. \"Why aren't you dead yet?\" she asked.\nStanley only half listened to the talk of the counselors. He didn't know who \"that\nwoman\" was or what \"A.G.\" meant. He didn't even realize they were initials. It sounded\nlike one word, \"Age-ee.\" His mind was focused on the tiny claws that moved up and\ndown his skin and through his hair.\nHe tried to think about other things. He didn't want to die with the images of the\nWarden, Mr. Sir, and the lizards etched into his brain. Instead, he tried to see his\nmother's face.\nHis brain took him back to a time when he was very little, all bundled up in a\nsnowsuit. He and his mother were walking, hand in hand, mitten in mitten, when they\nboth slipped on some ice and fell and rolled down a snow-covered hillside. They ended\nup at the bottom of the hill. He remembered he almost cried, but instead he laughed. His\nmother laughed, too.\nHe could feel the same light-headed feeling he felt then, dizzy from rolling down\nthe hill. He felt the sharp coldness of the snow against his ear. He could see flecks of\nsnow on his mother's bright and cheery face.\nThis was where he wanted to be when he died.\n\"Hey, Caveman, guess what?\" said Mr. Sir. \"You're innocent, after all. I thought\nyou'd like to know that. Your lawyer came to get you yesterday. Too bad you weren't\nhere.\"\nThe words meant nothing to Stanley, who was still in the snow. He and his mother\nclimbed back up the hill and rolled down again, this time on purpose. Later they had hot\nchocolate with lots of melted marshmallows.\n\"It's getting close to 4:30,\" said Mr. Pendanski. \"They'll be waking up.\"\nThe Warden told the counselors to return to the tents. She told them to give the\ncampers breakfast and to make sure they didn't talk to anyone. As long as they did as\n\n93\nthey were told, they wouldn't have to dig any more holes. If they talked, they would be\nseverely punished.\n\"How should we say they will be punished?\" one of the counselors asked.\n\"Let them use their imaginations,\" said the Warden.\nStanley watched the counselors return to the tents, leaving only the Warden and Mr.\nSir behind. He knew the Warden didn't care whether the campers dug any more holes or\nnot. She'd found what she was looking for.\nHe glanced at Zero. A lizard was perched on his shoulder.\nZero remained perfectly still except for his right hand, which slowly formed into a\nfist. Then he raised his thumb, giving Stanley the thumbs-up sign.\nStanley thought back to what Mr. Sir had said to him earlier, and the bits of\nconversation he'd overheard. He tried to make sense out of it. Mr. Sir had said\nsomething about a lawyer, but Stanley knew his parents couldn't afford a lawyer.\nHis legs were sore from remaining rigid for so long. Standing still was more\nstrenuous than walking. He slowly allowed himself to lean against the side of the hole.\nThe lizards didn't seem to mind.\n\n47\nThe sun was up, and Stanley's heart was still beating. There were eight lizards in the\nhole with him. Each one had exactly eleven yellow spots.\nThe Warden had dark circles under her eyes from Jack of sleep, and lines across her\nforehead and face which seemed exaggerated in the stark morning light. Her skin\nlooked blotchy.\n\"Satan, \"said Zero.\nStanley looked at him, unsure if Zero had even spoken or if he'd just imagined it.\n\"Why don't you go see if you can take the suitcase from Zero,\" the Warden\nsuggested.\n\"Yeah, right,\" said Mr. Sir.\n\"The lizards obviously aren't hungry,\" said the Warden.\n\"Then you go get the suitcase,\" said Mr. Sir.\nThey waited.\n\"Sa-tan lee,\" said Zero.\nSometime later Stanley saw a tarantula crawl across the dirt, not too far from his\nhole. He had never seen a tarantula before, but there was no doubt what it was. He was\nmomentarily fascinated by it, as its big hairy body moved slowly and steadily along.\n\"Look, a tarantula,\" said Mr. Sir, also fascinated.\n\"I've never seen one,\" said the Warden. \"Except in\u2014 \"\nStanley suddenly felt a sharp sting on the side of his neck.\nThe lizard hadn't bitten him, however. It was merely pushing off.\nIt leapt off Stanley's neck and pounced on the tarantula. The last Stanley saw of it\nwas one hairy leg sticking out of the lizard's mouth.\n\n94\n\n\"Not hungry, huh?\" said Mr. Sir.\nStanley tried to return to the snow, but it was harder to get there when the sun was\nup.\nAs the sun rose, the lizards moved lower in the hole, keeping mainly in the shade.\nThey were no longer on his head and shoulders but had moved down to his stomach,\nlegs, and feet.\nHe couldn't see any lizards on Zero, but believed there were two, between Zero's\nknees, shaded from the sun by the suitcase.\n\"How are you doing?\" Stanley asked quietly. He didn't whisper, but his voice was\ndry and raspy.\n\"My legs are numb,\" said Zero.\n\"I'm going to try to climb out of the hole,\" Stanley said.\nAs he tried to pull himself up, using just his arms, he felt a claw dig into his ankle.\nHe gently eased himself back down.\n\"Is your last name your first name backward?\" Zero asked.\nStanley stared at him in amazement. Had he been working on that all night?\nHe heard the sound of approaching cars.\nMr. Sir and the Warden heard it as well.\n\"You think it's them?\" asked the Warden.\n\"It ain't Girl Scouts selling cookies,\" said Mr. Sir.\nHe heard the cars come to a stop, and the doors open and shut. A little while later he\nsaw Mr. Pendanski and two strangers, coming across the lake. One was a tall man in a\nbusiness suit and cowboy hat. The other was a short woman holding a briefcase. The\nwoman had to take three steps for every two taken by the man. \"Stanley Yelnats?\" she\ncalled, moving out ahead of the others.\n\"I suggest you don't come any closer,\" said Mr. Sir.\n\"You can't stop me,\" she snapped, then took a second glance at him, wearing\npajama pants and nothing else. \"We'll get you out of there, Stanley,\" she said. \"Don't\nyou worry.\" She appeared to be Hispanic, with straight black hair and dark eyes. She\nspoke with a little bit of a Mexican accent, trilling her r's.\n\"What in tarnation?\" the tall man exclaimed, as he came up behind her.\nShe turned on him. \"I'm telling you right now, if any harm comes to him, we will be\nfiling charges not only against Ms. Walker and Camp Green Lake but the entire state of\nTexas as well. Child abuse. False imprisonment. Torture.\"\nThe man was more than a head taller than she, and was able to look directly over her\nas he spoke to the Warden.\n\"How long have they been in there?\"\n\"All night, as you can see by the way we're dressed. They snuck into my cabin while\nI was asleep, and stole my suitcase. I chased after them, and they ran out here and fell\ninto the lizards' nest. I don't know what they were thinking.\"\n\"That's not true!\" Stanley said.\n\n95\n\"Stanley, as your attorney, I advise you not to say anything,\" said the woman, \"until\nyou and I have had a chance to talk in private.\"\nStanley wondered why the Warden lied about the suitcase. He wondered who it\nlegally belonged to. That was one thing he wanted to ask his lawyer, if she really was\nhis lawyer.\n\"It's a miracle they're still alive,\" said the tall man.\n\"Yes, it is,\" the Warden agreed, with just a trace of disappointment in her voice.\n\"And they better come out of this alive,\" Stanley's lawyer warned. \"This wouldn't\nhave happened if you'd released him to me yesterday.\"\n\"It wouldn't have happened if he wasn't a thief,\" said the Warden. \"I told him he\nwould be set free today, and I guess he decided he'd try to take some of my valuables\nwith him. He's been delirious for the last week.\"\n\"Why didn't you release him when she came to you yesterday?\" the tall man asked.\n\"She didn't have proper authorization,\" said the Warden.\n\"I had a court order!\"\n\"It was not authenticated,\" the Warden said.\n\"Authenticated? It was signed by the judge who sentenced him.\"\n\"I needed authentication from the Attorney General,\" said the Warden. \"How do I\nknow it's legitimate? The boys in my custody have proven themselves dangerous to\nsociety. Am I supposed to just turn them loose any time someone hands me a piece of\npaper?\"\n\"Yes,\" said the woman. \"If it's a court order.\"\n\"Stanley has been hospitalized for the last few days,\" the Warden explained. \"He's\nbeen suffering from hallucinations and delirium. Ranting and raving. He was in no\ncondition to leave. The fact that he was trying to steal from me on the day before his\nrelease proves . . .\"\nStanley tried to climb out of his hole, using mostly his arms so as not to disturb the\nlizards too much. As he pulled himself upward, the lizards moved downward, keeping\nout of the sun's direct rays. He swung his legs up and over, and the last of the lizards\nhopped off.\n\"Thank God!\" exclaimed the Warden. She started toward him, then stopped.\nA lizard crawled out of his pocket and down his leg.\nStanley was overcome by a rush of dizziness and almost fell over. He steadied\nhimself, then reached down, took hold of Zero's arm, and helped him slowly to his feet.\nZero still held the suitcase.\nThe lizards, which had been hiding under it, scurried quickly into the hole.\nStanley and Zero staggered away.\nThe Warden rushed to them. She hugged Zero. \"Thank God, you're alive,\" she said,\nas she tried to take the suitcase from him.\nHe jerked it free. \"It belongs to Stanley,\" he said.\n\"Don't cause any more trouble,\" the Warden warned. \"You stole it from my cabin,\nand you've been caught red-handed. If I press charges, Stanley might have to return to\nprison. Now I'm willing, in view of all the circumstances, to\u2014 \"\n\"It's got his name on it,\" said Zero.\n\n96\n\nStanley's lawyer pushed past the tall man to have a look.\n\"See,\" Zero showed her. \"Stanley Yelnats.\"\nStanley looked, too. There, in big black letters, was STANLEY YELNATS.\nThe tall man looked over the heads of the others at the name on the suitcase. \"You\nsay he stole it from your cabin?\"\nThe Warden stared at it in disbelief. \"That's im . . . imposs . . . It's imposs . . .\" She\ncouldn't even say it.\n\n48\nThey slowly walked back to camp. The tall man was the Texas Attorney General,\nthe chief law enforcement officer for the state. Stanley's lawyer was named Ms.\nMorengo.\nStanley held the suitcase. He was so tired he couldn't think straight. He felt as if he\nwas walking in a dream, not quite able to comprehend what was going on around him.\nThey stopped in front of the camp office. Mr. Sir went inside to get Stanley's\nbelongings. The Attorney General told Mr. Pendanski to get the boys something to\ndrink and eat.\nThe Warden seemed as dazed as Stanley. \"You can't even read,\" she said to Zero.\nZero said nothing.\nMs. Morengo put a hand on Stanley's shoulder and told him to hang in there. He\nwould be seeing his parents soon.\nShe was shorter than Stanley, but somehow gave the appearance of being tall.\nMr. Pendanski returned with two cartons of orange juice and two bagels. Stanley\ndrank the juice but didn't feel like eating anything.\n\"Wait!\" the Warden exclaimed. \"I didn't say they stole the suitcase. It's his suitcase,\nobviously, but he put my things from my cabin inside it.\"\n\"That isn't what you said earlier,\" said Ms. Morengo.\n\"What's in the suitcase?\" the Warden asked Stanley. \"Tell us what's in it, then we'll\nopen it and see!\"\nStanley didn't know what to do.\n\"Stanley, as your lawyer, I advise you not to open your suitcase,\" said Ms.\nMorengo.\n\"He has to open it!\" said the Warden. \"I have the right to check the personal\nproperty of any of the detainees. How do I know there aren't drugs or weapons in there?\nHe stole a car, too! I've got witnesses!\" She was nearly hysterical.\n\"He is no longer under your jurisdiction,\" said Stanley's lawyer.\n\"He has not been officially released,\" said the Warden. \"Open the suitcase,\nStanley!\"\n\"Do not open it,\" said Stanley's lawyer.\nStanley did nothing.\nMr. Sir returned from the office with Stanley's backpack and clothes.\n\n97\nThe Attorney General handed Ms. Morengo a sheet of paper. \"You're free to go,\" he\nsaid to Stanley. \"I know you're anxious to get out of here, so you can just keep the\norange suit as a souvenir. Or burn it, whatever you want. Good luck, Stanley.\"\nHe reached out his hand to shake, but Ms. Morengo hurried Stanley away. \"C'mon,\nStanley,\" she said. \"We have a lot to talk about.\"\nStanley stopped and turned to look at Zero. He couldn't just leave him here.\nZero gave him thumbs-up.\n\"I can't leave Hector,\" Stanley said.\n\"I suggest we go,\" said his lawyer with a sense of urgency in her voice.\n\"I'll be okay,\" said Zero. His eyes shifted toward Mr. Pendanski on one side of him,\nthen to the Warden and Mr. Sir on the other. '\n\"There's nothing I can do for your friend,\" said Ms. Morengo. \"You are released\npursuant to an order from the judge.\"\n\"They'll kill him,\" said Stanley.\n\"Your friend is not in danger,\" said the Attorney General. \"There's going to be an\ninvestigation into everything that's happened here. For the present, I am taking charge\nof the camp.\"\n\"C'mon, Stanley,\" said his lawyer. \"Your parents are waiting.\"\nStanley stayed where he was.\nHis lawyer sighed. \"May I have a look at Hector's file?\" she asked.\n\"Certainly,\" said the Attorney General. \"Ms. Walker, go get Hector's file.\"\nShe looked at him blankly.\n\"Well?\"\nThe Warden turned to Mr. Pendanski. \"Bring me Hector Zeroni's file.\"\nHe stared at her.\n\"Get it!\" she ordered.\nMr. Pendanski went into the office. He returned a few minutes later and announced\nthe file was apparently misplaced.\nThe Attorney General was outraged. \"What kind of camp are you running here, Ms.\nWalker?\"\nThe Warden said nothing. She stared at the suitcase.\nThe Attorney General assured Stanley's lawyer that he would get the records.\n\"Excuse me, while I call my office.\" He turned back to the Warden. \"I assume the\nphone works.\" He walked into the camp office, slamming the door behind him. A little\nwhile later he reappeared and told the Warden he wanted to talk to her.\nShe cursed, then went inside.\nStanley gave Zero thumbs-up.\n\"Caveman? Is that you?\"\nHe turned to see Armpit and Squid coming out of the Wreck Room. Squid shouted\nback into the Wreck Room, \"Caveman and Zero are out here!\"\nSoon all the boys from Group D had gathered around him and Zero.\n\"Good to see you, man,\" Armpit said, shaking his hand. \"We thought you were\nbuzzard food.\"\n\"Stanley is being released today,\" said Mr. Pendanski.\n\n98\n\n\"Way to go,\" said Magnet, hitting him on the shoulder.\n\"And you didn't even have to step on a rattlesnake,\" said Squid.\nEven Zigzag shook Stanley's hand. \"Sorry about . . . you know.\"\n\"It's cool,\" said Stanley.\n\"We had to lift the truck clear out of the hole,\" Zigzag told him. \"It took everybody\nin C, D, and E. We just picked it right up.\"\n\"It was really cool,\" said Twitch.\nX-Ray was the only one who didn't come over. Stanley saw him hang back behind\nthe others a moment, then return to the Wreck Room.\n\"Guess what?\" said Magnet, glancing at Mr. Pendanski. \"Mom says we don't have\nto dig any more holes.\"\n\"That's great,\" Stanley said.\n\"Will you do me a favor?\" asked Squid.\n\"I guess,\" Stanley agreed, somewhat hesitantly.\n\"I want you to\u2014 \" He turned to Ms. Morengo. \"Hey, lady, you have a pen and paper\nI can borrow?\"\nShe gave it to him, and Squid wrote down a phone number which he gave to Stanley.\n\"Call my mom for me, okay? Tell her . . . Tell her I said I was sorry. Tell her Alan said\nhe was sorry.\"\nStanley promised he would.\n\"Now you be careful out in the real world,\" said Armpit. \"Not everybody is as nice\nas us.\"\nStanley smiled.\nThe boys departed when the Warden came out of the office. The Attorney General\nwas right behind her.\n\"My office is having some difficulty locating Hector Zeroni's records,\" the\nAttorney General said.\n\"So you have no claim of authority over him?\" asked Ms. Morengo.\n\"I didn't say that. He's in the computer. We just can't access his records. It's like\nthey've fallen through a hole in cyberspace.\"\n\"A hole in cyberspace,\" Ms. Morengo repeated. \"How interesting. When is his\nrelease date?\"\n\"I don't know.\"\n\"How long has he been here?\"\n\"Like I said, we can't\u2014 \"\n\"So what are you planning to do with him? Keep him confined indefinitely, without\njustification, while you go crawling through black holes in cyberspace?\"\nThe Attorney General stared at her. \"He was obviously incarcerated for a reason.\"\n\"Oh? And what reason was that?\"\nThe Attorney General said nothing.\nStanley's lawyer took hold of Zero's hand. \"C'mon, Hector, you're coming with us.\"\n\n49\n\n99\nThere never used to be yellow-spotted lizards in the town of Green Lake. They\ndidn't come to the area until after the lake dried up. But the townsfolk had heard about\nthe \"red-eyed monsters\" living in the desert hills.\nOne afternoon, Sam, the onion man, and his donkey, Mary Lou, were returning to\nhis boat, which was anchored just a little off shore. It was late in November and the\npeach trees had lost most of their leaves.\n\"Sam!\" someone called.\nHe turned around to see three men running after him, waving their hats. He waited.\n\"Afternoon, Walter. Bo, Jesse,\" he greeted them, as they walked up, catching their\nbreath,\n\"Glad we caught you,\" said Bo. \"We're going rattlesnake hunting in the morning.\"\n\"We want to get some of your lizard juice,\" said Walter.\n\"I ain't a-scared of no rattlesnake,\" said Jesse. \"But I don't want to come across one\nof those red-eyed monsters. I seen one once, and that was enough. I knew about the red\neyes, of course. I hadn't heard about the big black teeth.\"\n\"It's the white tongues that get me,\" said Bo.\nSam gave each man two bottles of pure onion juice. He told them to drink one bottle\nbefore going to bed that night, then a half bottle in the morning, and then a half bottle\naround lunchtime.\n\"You sure this stuff works?\" asked Walter.\n\"I tell you what,\" said Sam. \"If it doesn't, you can come back next week and I'll give\nyou your money back.\"\nWalter looked around unsure, as Bo and Jesse laughed. Then Sam laughed, too.\nEven Mary Lou let out a rare hee-haw.\n\"Just remember,\" Sam told the men before they left. \"It's very important you drink a\nbottle tonight. You got to get it into your bloodstream. The lizards don't like onion\nblood.\"\nStanley and Zero sat in the backseat of Ms. Morengo's BMW. The suitcase lay\nbetween them. It was locked, and they decided they'd let Stanley's father try to open it\nin his workshop.\n\"You don't know what's in it, do you?\" she asked.\n\"No,\" said Stanley.\n\"I didn't think so.\"\nThe air-conditioning was on, but they drove with the windows open as well,\nbecause, \"No offense, but you boys really smell bad.\"\nMs. Morengo explained that she was a patent attorney. \"I'm helping your father\nwith the new product he's invented. He happened to mention your situation, so I did a\nlittle investigating. Clyde Livingston's sneakers were stolen sometime before 3:15. I\nfound a young man, Derrick Dunne, who said that at 3:20 you were in the bathroom\nfishing your notebook out of the toilet. Two girls remembered seeing you come out of\nthe boys' restroom carrying a wet notebook.\"\n\n100\nStanley felt his ears redden. Even after everything he'd been through, the memory\nstill caused him to feel shame.\n\"So you couldn't have stolen them,\" said Ms. Morengo.\n\"He didn't. I did,\" said Zero.\n\"You did what?\" asked Ms. Morengo.\n\"I stole the sneakers.\"\nThe lawyer actually turned around while driving and looked at him. \"I didn't hear\nthat,\" she said. \"And I advise you to make sure I don't hear it again.\"\n\"What did my father invent?\" Stanley asked. \"Did he find a way to recycle\nsneakers?\"\n\"No, he's still working on that,\" explained Ms. Morengo. \"But he invented a product\nthat eliminates foot odor. Here, I've got a sample in my briefcase. I wish I had more.\nYou two could bathe in it.\"\nShe opened her briefcase with one hand and passed a small bottle back to Stanley. It\nhad a fresh and somewhat spicy smell. He handed it to Zero.\n\"What's it called?\" Stanley asked.\n\"We haven't come up with a name yet,\" said Ms. Morengo.\n\"It smells familiar,\" said Zero.\n\"Peaches, right?\" asked Ms. Morengo. \"That's what everyone says.\"\nA short while later both boys fell asleep. Behind them the sky had turned dark, and\nfor the first time in over a hundred years, a drop of rain fell into the empty lake.\n\nPART THREE\nFILLING IN THE HOLES\n\n50\nStanley's mother insists that there never was a curse. She even doubts whether\nStanley's great-great-grandfather really stole a pig. The reader might find it interesting,\nhowever, that Stanley's father invented his cure for foot odor the day after the\ngreat-great-grandson of Elya Yelnats carried the great-great-great-grandson of\nMadame Zeroni up the mountain.\nThe Attorney General closed Camp Green Lake. Ms. Walker, w ho was in desperate\nneed of money, had to sell the land which had been in her family for generations. It was\nbought by a national organization dedicated to the well-being of young girls. In a few\nyears, Camp Green Lake will become a Girl Scout camp.\nThis is pretty much the end of the story. The reader probably still has some\nquestions, but unfortunately, from here on in, the answers tend to be long and tedious.\nWhile Mrs. Bell, Stanley's former math teacher, might want to know the percent change\nin Stanley's weight, the reader probably cares more about the change in Stanley's\n\n101\ncharacter and self-confidence. But those changes are subtle and hard to measure. There\nis no simple answer.\nEven the contents of the suitcase turned out to be somewhat tedious. Stanley's father\npried it open in his workshop, and at first everyone gasped at the sparkling jewels.\nStanley thought he and Hector had become millionaires. But the jewels were of poor\nquality, worth no more than twenty thousand dollars.\nUnderneath the jewels was a stack of papers that had once belonged to the first\nStanley Yelnats. These consisted of stock certificates, deeds of trust, and promissory\nnotes. They were hard to read and even more difficult to understand. Ms. Morengo's\nlaw firm spent more than two months going through all the papers.\nThey turned out to be a lot more valuable than the jewels. After legal fees and taxes,\nStanley and Zero each received less than a million dollars.\nBut not a lot less.\nIt was enough for Stanley to buy his family a new house, with a laboratory in the\nbasement, and for Hector to hire a team of private investigators.\nBut it would be boring to go through all the tedious details of all the changes in their\nlives. Instead, the reader will be presented with one last scene, which took place almost\na year and a half after Stanley and Hector left Camp Green Lake.\nYou will have to fill in the holes yourself.\nThere was a small party at the Yelnats house. Except for Stanley and Hector,\neveryone there was an adult. All kinds of snacks and drinks were set out on the counter,\nincluding caviar, champagne, and the fixings to make ice cream sundaes.\nThe Super Bowl was on television, but nobody was really watching.\n\"It should be coming on at the next break,\" Ms. Morengo announced.\nA time-out was called in the football game, and a commercial came on the screen.\nEveryone stopped talking and watched.\nThe commercial showed a baseball game. Amid a cloud of dust, Clyde Livingston\nslid into home plate as the catcher caught the ball and tried to tag him out.\n\"Safe!\" shouted the umpire as he signaled with his arms.\nThe people at Stanley's house cheered, as if the run really counted.\nClyde Livingston got up and dusted the dirt off his uniform. As he made his way\nback to the dugout, he spoke to the camera. \"Hi, I'm Clyde Livingston, but everyone\naround here calls me 'Sweet Feet.'\"\n\"Way to go, Sweet Feet!\" said another baseball player, slapping his hand.\nBesides being on the television screen, Clyde Livingston was also sitting on the\ncouch next to Stanley.\n\"But my feet weren't always sweet,\" the television Clyde Livingston said as he sat\ndown on the dugout bench. \"They used to smell so bad that nobody would sit near me in\nthe dugout.\"\n\"They really did stink,\" said the woman sitting on the couch on the other side of\nClyde. She held her nose with one hand, and fanned the air with the other.\nClyde shushed her.\n\n102\n\"Then a teammate told me about Sploosh,\" said the television Clyde. He pulled a\ncan of Sploosh out from under the dugout bench and held it up for everyone to see. \"I\njust spray a little on each foot every morning, and now I really do have sweet feet. Plus,\nI like the tingle.\"\n\"Sploosh,\" said a voice. \"A treat for your feet. Made from all natural ingredients, it\nneutralizes odor-causing fungi and bacteria. Plus, you'll like the tingle.\"\nEveryone at the party clapped their hands.\n\"He wasn't lying,\" said the woman who sat next to Clyde. \"I couldn't even be in the\nsame room with his socks.\"\nThe other people at the party laughed.\nThe woman continued. \"I'm not joking. It was so bad\u2014 \"\n\"You've made your point,\" said Clyde, covering her mouth with his hand. He\nlooked back at Stanley. \"Will you do me a favor, Stanley?\"\nStanley raised and lowered his left shoulder.\n\"I'm going to get more caviar,\" said Clyde. \"Keep your hand over my wife's mouth.\"\nHe patted Stanley on the shoulder as he rose from the couch.\nStanley looked uncertainly at his hand, then at Clyde Livingston's wife.\nShe winked at him.\nHe felt himself blush, and turned away toward Hector, who was sitting on the floor\nin front of an overstuffed chair.\nA woman sitting in the chair behind Hector was absent-mindedly fluffing his hair\nwith her fingers. She wasn't very old, but her skin had a weathered look to it, almost like\nleather. Her eyes seemed weary, as if she'd seen too many things in her life that she\ndidn't want to see. And when she smiled, her mouth seemed too big for her face.\nVery softly, she half sang, half hummed a song that her grandmother used to sing to\nher when she was a little girl.\nIf only, if only, the moon speaks no reply;\nReflecting the sun and all that's gone by.\nBe strong my weary wolf, turn around boldly.\nFly high, my baby bird,\nMy angel, my only.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Camp Green Lake===\n*{{anchor|Stanley Yelnats IV}}'''Stanley Yelnats IV''' (also known as \"'''Caveman'''\" by the rest of the campers, but referred to in the book by his proper name): Stanley is a 14-year-old boy who does not have any friends from school and is often picked on by his classmates and the school bully. Stanley's family is cursed with bad luck, and although they do not have much money, they always try to remain hopeful and look on the bright side of things. Stanley shares these traits with his family and, although he does not have a lot of self-confidence, he is not easily depressed, a characteristic that helps him adjust to the horrendous conditions of Camp Green Lake. However, he has a bad habit of blaming his great great grandfather when he gets in trouble. This habit made him [[Impudence|impudent]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.louissachar.com/holes-q--a.html |title =Holes Q & A |accessdate =January 17, 2017|website = www.Louissachar.com }}</ref> As the book progresses, Stanley slowly gains strength. He identifies the people who threaten him, like the Warden, and while he tries not to get in trouble he also stands up for himself and his friends and family. Stanley rebels for the rights of his friends when he steals Mr. Sir's truck to look for his friend Zero in the dry lake bed.<ref>Sachar, Louis (1998). \"Holes\", p. 103. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York 30 November 2015.</ref>\n*{{anchor|Hector \"Zero\" Zeroni}}'''Zero (Hector Zeroni)''': Zero is known to be the best digger at Camp Green Lake. So often, he is considered to be \"stupid\" or a mere nothing by the other boys and the counselors at the lake. He lacks an education, meaning he cannot really read or write. However, he is smart and manages to stand for himself in the face of adversity, breaking Mr. Pendanski's nose with a shovel after one too many snide remarks. Typically he is noted as the character that hardly speaks due to the fact that he is wary of those who mock him. He is said to always have a scowl on his face and does not like to answer questions. Zero is shown to be an honest character after becoming close friends with Stanley. Zero is the one who stole the shoes that Stanley was arrested for and accused of stealing. He is the great-great-great-grandson of Madame Zeroni, the woman who put a curse on Stanley's family. He has been homeless for most of his life, as well as being abandoned by his mother at a very young age. Although he suffers quite a bit, he always seems to persevere and come out on top.\n*'''X-Ray (Rex Washburn)''': X-Ray is the unofficial head of the boys in Group D. X-Ray decides that Stanley will be called Caveman and fixes the order of the line for water. X-Ray maintains his position as the leader of the boys even though he is one of the smallest and can barely see without his glasses. He convinces Stanley to give him the lipstick tube that Stanley finds in his hole so that he can have the day off instead of Stanley. X-Ray is able to maintain his position at the head of the group through a system of rewards and allies. Every time that Stanley does something nice for X-Ray, X-Ray is nice to Stanley and stands up for him when the other boys pick on him. When Stanley becomes friends with Zero, however, X-Ray's system is threatened and he becomes hostile towards Stanley. His nickname X-ray comes from it being [[pig Latin]] of his actual name, Rex.\n*'''Squid (Alan)''': Squid is a member of Group D at Camp Green Lake. He is often the one for taunting Stanley for sending and receiving letters to his mother. Just like X-Ray, Squid is very tough but very subservient to X-Ray's rules and directions.\n*'''Magnet (Jos\u00e9)''': Another member of Group D. Magnet earned his nickname because of his ability to steal, he got into Camp Green Lake for stealing animals from the zoo and refers to his fingers as \"little magnets\".\n*'''Armpit (Theodore Johnson)''': One of X-Ray's close friends at camp, he pushes Stanley when Stanley calls him Theodore. His nickname Armpit is due to him being stung by a scorpion at camp and the venom travelling up into his armpit, causing him to complain about his armpit hurting.\n*'''ZigZag (Ricky)''': Zigzag is described as being the tallest kid of Group D, constantly looking like he has been electrocuted, with frizzy hair. Stanley often thinks he is the weirdest and craziest kid at Camp Green Lake. Zigzag is the one who hit Stanley on the head with a shovel and did not apologise for doing so. Zigzag suffers from [[paranoia]], highlighting his displayed \"craziness\".\n*'''Twitch (Brian)''': A car thief who arrives at camp after Stanley.\n*'''The Warden (Ms. Walker)''': Running Camp Green Lake, she is known to be violent, abusive, and quite rude. She uses her power and privilege to get what she wants and make members of the camp do as she pleases. She has hidden cameras, using them to spy on the members of the camp. She is often thought to have hidden cameras in the showers, causing Stanley to be paranoid whenever he takes a shower, rushing out as fast as possible. She wears nail polish traced with rattlesnake venom, and scratches those who displease or go against what she says. She has the members of Camp Green Lake digging holes to look for Kate Barlow's hidden treasure. She is the granddaughter of Charles \"Trout\" Walker. Her family had been digging the treasure out since her birth, but to no success.\n*'''Mr. Sir (Marion Sevillo)''': One of the counselors at Camp Green Lake, he is constantly eating sunflower seeds. He took up this habit after deciding to quit smoking. He is known to be rude and tough.\n*'''Mr. Pendanski''': In Group D at Camp Green Lake Mr. Pendanski is in charge. Mr. Pendanski may seem friendly, but he is just as mean as the Warden and Mr. Sir. He never stops making fun of Zero ever since he has been at the camp, which comes back to bite him when the boy cracks him in the face with a shovel.\n\n===Town of Green Lake===\n* '''Katherine Barlow (Kissin' Kate Barlow)''': Katherine Barlow is a sweet and intelligent woman who teaches in a one-room school house on Green Lake one hundred and ten years before Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake. She falls in love with Sam, a man who sells onions in the town. Although the rest of the white people in the town are racist and enforce rules that prohibit black people from going to school, Kate, who is white, does not care about the color of a person's skin and she loves Sam for the person that he is. When Kate and Sam kiss, the angry townsfolk kill Sam and destroy her beloved schoolhouse. Kate is devastated by Sam's death and becomes Kissin' Kate Barlow, one of the most feared outlaws in the West. She always leaves her mark by kissing someone when she finishes killing them; if she had only robbed them, she would leave them in the hot desert. She is the outlaw responsible for robbing Stanley Yelnats I (Stanley's ancestor). Kate dies when a yellow spotted lizard bites her foot, but dies laughing because the Walker family will never find her treasure. The lipstick tube that Stanley finds during his second week at Camp Green Lake was owned by Kate Barlow.\n*'''Sam''': Sam is an African-American farmer in the town Green Lake, Texas who grows onions. He believes onions are the cure to everything and makes many remedies from onions. He also has an immense love for his donkey, Mary Lou. His relationship with Kate begins when he exchanges his onions for some jars of peaches. He is murdered in cold blood by Charles \"Trout\" Walker.\n*'''Charles \"Trout\" Walker''': Charles \"Trout\" Walker is an extremely spoiled son of a rich family in Green Lake. He gets upset when Kate denies his request to date her. This adds on to the reason of causing him to lead the townspeople to burn down the schoolhouse and kill Sam. His nickname Trout comes from his foot fungus that causes his feet to smell like dead fish. After Kate leaves to become an outlaw, he marries Linda Miller but his family loses everything after the lake dries up. He is The Warden's grandfather, who upon his death, opens up the juvenile detention camp to increase the efficiency of finding Kate Barlow's hidden treasure.\n*'''Stanley Yelnats I''': Stanley Yelnats I is the son of Elya Yelnats as well as the great-grandfather of Stanley Yelnats IV. He was the one whose treasure was stolen by Kate Barlow while he was moving from New York to California. He is known to have survived by climbing to the top of a thumb-shaped mountain (God's Thumb) which happens to be Sam's old onion field.\n\n===Mid-1800s Latvia===\n*'''Elya Yelnats''': Elya is the great-great-grandfather of Stanley. He is often referred to as his \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather\", constantly being blamed for everything that goes wrong in Stanley's life.  He is considered to be the reason why the Yelnats family has such bad luck. After he fell in love with the woman in Latvia, he travels to America, forgetting to go through with the promise he made to an old woman named Madame Zeroni. This causes generations of bad luck to trickle down the Yelnats family tree. However, he does pass down an important song that Madame Zeroni taught him in Latvia.\n*'''Madame Zeroni''': Madame Zeroni is the great-great-great-grandmother of Hector Zeroni (Zero). She is great friends with Elya Yelnats, and she gives him a pig. Because Elya breaks his promise of carrying her to the top of the mountain, she is considered to be the one who put a \"curse\" on the Yelnats family.\n*'''Myra Menke''': Myra is the most beautiful girl in the Latvian village of Elya and Madame Zeroni. Madame Zeroni compares her to a flowerpot. Myra's father promised to award her hand in marriage to whichever suitor can raise the fattest pig. When the pigs were the same size, Myra asked Elya and Igor Barkov to guess a number between 1 and 10, showing her inability to make her own decisions.\n*'''Igor Barkov''': Igor was Elya's competitor for the hand of Myra Menke. He was already old and fat, but was a successful pig farmer.\n\n===Minor characters===\n*'''Mr. Yelnats (Stanley Yelnats III)''': Mr. Yelnats is Stanley's father. He is an inventor and quite smart, but extremely unlucky. He attempts to discover a way to recycle old sneakers and because of this, the Yelnats' apartment smells bad. However, he eventually discovers a cure to ridding foot odor and is able to hire a lawyer, Ms. Morengo, to get Stanley out of Camp Green Lake.\n*'''Mrs. Yelnats''': Mrs. Yelnats is Stanley's mother. She does not believe in curses but always points out the terrible luck that the Yelnats have.\n*'''Barf Bag (Louis)''': An inmate who left Camp Green Lake before Stanley arrived. He deliberately got a rattlesnake to bite him in order to be hospitalized.\n\n==Setting==\nCamp Green Lake is located on a dried-up lake in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Louis|title=Holes|url=https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Yearling|location=New York|isbn=978-0440414803|page=[https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4/page/n10 1]}}</ref> The name is a false description, as the area is a parched, barren desert. The only weather is scorching sun. No rain has fallen since the day Sam was murdered. The only plants mentioned are two oak trees in front of the Warden's cabin; the book notes that \"the Warden owns the shade.\" The abandoned town of Green Lake is located by the side of the lakebed. Camp Green Lake is a juvenile detention center, where inmates spend most of their time digging holes. The majority of the book alternates between the present day story of Stanley Yelnats, the story of Elya Yelnats in Latvia (mid-1800s) and the story of Katherine Barlow in the town of Green Lake (about a generation later). Later chapters focus less on the past stories.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Fairy tales ===\nThe themes typical of a folk or [[fairy tale]] are present throughout the novel, notable in both Stanley and Elya's narratives.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Elizabeth G.|date=2001|title=Holes: Folklore Redux|url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/v28n2/mascia.html|journal=The ALAN Review|volume=28| issue =  2|pages=51|via=|doi=10.21061/alan.v28i2.a.11}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Pinsent|first=Pat|date=2002-09-01|title=Fate and Fortune in a Modern Fairy Tale: Louis Sachar's Holes|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=203\u2013212|doi=10.1023/A:1019682032315|issn=0045-6713}}</ref> Elya must go on an adventure to win his love's approval and prove his own worth and he is eventually placed under a witch's curse.

The book centers on an unlucky teenage boy named Stanley Yelnats, who is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility in a desert in Texas, after being falsely accused of theft. The plot explores the history of the area and how the actions of several characters in the past have affected Stanley's life in the present. These interconnecting stories touch on themes such as racism, homelessness, illiteracy, and arranged marriage.\n\nThe book was both a critical and commercial success. Much of the praise for the book has centered around its complex plot, interesting characters, and representation of people of color and incarcerated youth. It won the 1998 U.S. [[National Book Award for Young People's Literature]] and the 1999 [[Newbery Medal]] for the year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\". In 2012 it was ranked number six among all-time children's novels in a survey published by ''[[School Library Journal]]''.\n\n''Holes'' was adapted by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] as a [[Holes (film)|feature film of the same name]] released in 2003. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, grossing $71 million, and was released in conjunction with the book companion ''Stanley Yelnats's Survival Guide to Camp Green Lake''. A sequel to ''Holes'' entitled ''[[Small Steps (novel)|Small Steps]]'' was published in 2006 and centers on one of the secondary characters in the novel, Armpit.\n\n==Plot==\nStanley Yelnats IV is a 14-year-old boy from a hard-working but poor family that is allegedly cursed, for which they blame  Stanley's \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great-grandfather\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Louis|title=Holes|url=https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Yearling Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0440414803|page=[https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4/page/7 7]}}</ref> Stanley's latest stroke of misfortune occurs when he is [[miscarriage of justice|wrongfully convicted]] of stealing a pair of athletic shoes that belonged to a famous baseball player. He is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile corrections facility which is ironically located in the middle of a desert; the lake dried up decades ago. The inmates are assigned to dig one hole each day, five feet wide and five feet deep, which the Warden claims \"builds their character\". The novel alternates this story with two set in the past, with interrelated but distinct plot lines.\n\n=== Elya Yelnats ===\nStanley's [[Latvia]]n great-great-grandfather, Elya Yelnats, falls in love with a fifteen-year-old girl named Myra. However, her father would rather she married the much older pig farmer Igor, who can offer him his fattest pig. Elya goes to his friend Madame Zeroni for help. Despite not approving of Myra as a partner, she gives him a tiny piglet, telling him to carry it up a mountain every day, and let it drink from a stream while singing to it. Each time, the pig will grow bigger. Zeroni says that in return, Elya must then carry her up the mountain. She warns him that if he does not do this, his family will be cursed.\n\nElya follows her directions\u2014-except the direction to do the routine for a final time on Myra\u2019s birthday\u2014-and the pig grows to be just as large as Igor\u2019s. After realizing Myra does not care whether she marries him or Igor, Elya leaves in disgust and instead moves to America. He forgets his promise to Zeroni. Though he falls in love and marries, he becomes beset by bad luck. The song that he sang to the pig becomes a lullaby that is passed down among his descendants.\n\n=== Kissin' Kate  ===\nIn the year 1888, the town of Green Lake is a flourishing lakeside community. Katherine Barlow, the white local schoolteacher, falls in love with Sam, an African-American onion seller, while rejecting advances from wealthy resident Charles Walker. There is an uproar in the town after Katherine and Sam are seen kissing. Seeing a dangerous mob gather, Katherine finds Sam and they attempt an escape across the lake in Sam's rowboat, but Walker and the mob intercept them with Walker's motorboat. Sam is shot dead, while Katherine is \"rescued\" against her wishes. From then on, no rain falls upon Green Lake again.\n\nThree days later, Katherine kills the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], in revenge for his refusal to help. She then becomes a prominent outlaw called \"Kissin' Kate Barlow\". Among her victims are Stanley's great-grandfather. He was left abandoned in the desert, but survived. Later on, she is tracked down by a now-destitute Charles Walker and his wife. They try to force her to reveal where she buried her loot, but she is bitten by a venomous lizard and dies. She taunts them with her last words: \"Start digging!\"\n\n=== Camp Green Lake ===\nThe Warden allows the inmates the rest of their day off if they find anything \"interesting\". Stanley begins to suspect the Warden is looking for something. During one dig, he finds one of Barlow's lipstick tubes. He gives it to X-Ray, the ringleader of his group, who pretends to find it the next day. The Warden is excited by the discovery and orders them to enlarge X-Ray's hole. Stanley befriends Zero, a [[street child]] and a descendant of Madame Zeroni. Stanley teaches Zero to read in return for Zero digging part of Stanley's holes. This leads to an argument with the other inmates, and then the staff. Zero then flees. The camp staff decide to erase their record of him and let him die in the desert.\n\nA few days later, Stanley follows Zero and finds him living under the remains of Sam's boat, eating very old jars of Barlow's spiced peaches, which he calls \"Sploosh\". Stanley notices a mountain resembling a [[Thumbs signal|thumbs up]] sign, and recalls his grandfather claimed to find \"refuge on God\u2019s thumb\". They journey across the desert and up the mountain, where they discover a field of onions that was once Sam's. The boys eat the onions and find water by digging in the ground, and Stanley sings Madame Zeroni's song to Zero.\n\nThey return to camp and dig in the hole Stanley found the lipstick tube, unearthing a suitcase and venomous lizards. The Warden and staff appear and demand they hand it over, but retreat because of the lizards, which are passive to Stanley and Zero (it is implied onions deter them). The Warden is revealed to be Walker's granddaughter. Stanley's attorney appears at the camp, explaining that Stanley has been exonerated. Zero reveals the suitcase belongs to the Yelnats family, stopping the Warden from taking it. Fearing that the Warden will kill Zero if they leave him behind, Stanley refuses to leave unless Zero can come along. The attorney asks for Zero's file, but the camp staff are naturally unable to find it, so Zero is also released.\n\nThe suitcase contains financial documents that are worth not much less than a million dollars. Stanley's family buy a new house and Zero hires a team of investigators to find his missing mother. Stanley's father makes further money by inventing an antidote to foot odor, made from peaches and onions and named \"Sploosh\" by Zero{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. Meanwhile, the drought at Green Lake is brought to an end by rainfall. Camp Green Lake is closed and sold to become a Girl Scouts' camp.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Camp Green Lake===\n*{{anchor|Stanley Yelnats IV}}'''Stanley Yelnats IV''' (also known as \"'''Caveman'''\" by the rest of the campers, but referred to in the book by his proper name): Stanley is a 14-year-old boy who does not have any friends from school and is often picked on by his classmates and the school bully. Stanley's family is cursed with bad luck, and although they do not have much money, they always try to remain hopeful and look on the bright side of things. Stanley shares these traits with his family and, although he does not have a lot of self-confidence, he is not easily depressed, a characteristic that helps him adjust to the horrendous conditions of Camp Green Lake. However, he has a bad habit of blaming his great great grandfather when he gets in trouble. This habit made him [[Impudence|impudent]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.louissachar.com/holes-q--a.html |title =Holes Q & A |accessdate =January 17, 2017|website = www.Louissachar.com }}</ref> As the book progresses, Stanley slowly gains strength. He identifies the people who threaten him, like the Warden, and while he tries not to get in trouble he also stands up for himself and his friends and family. Stanley rebels for the rights of his friends when he steals Mr. Sir's truck to look for his friend Zero in the dry lake bed.<ref>Sachar, Louis (1998). \"Holes\", p. 103. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York 30 November 2015.</ref>\n*{{anchor|Hector \"Zero\" Zeroni}}'''Zero (Hector Zeroni)''': Zero is known to be the best digger at Camp Green Lake. So often, he is considered to be \"stupid\" or a mere nothing by the other boys and the counselors at the lake. He lacks an education, meaning he cannot really read or write. However, he is smart and manages to stand for himself in the face of adversity, breaking Mr. Pendanski's nose with a shovel after one too many snide remarks. Typically he is noted as the character that hardly speaks due to the fact that he is wary of those who mock him. He is said to always have a scowl on his face and does not like to answer questions. Zero is shown to be an honest character after becoming close friends with Stanley. Zero is the one who stole the shoes that Stanley was arrested for and accused of stealing. He is the great-great-great-grandson of Madame Zeroni, the woman who put a curse on Stanley's family. He has been homeless for most of his life, as well as being abandoned by his mother at a very young age. Although he suffers quite a bit, he always seems to persevere and come out on top.\n*'''X-Ray (Rex Washburn)''': X-Ray is the unofficial head of the boys in Group D. X-Ray decides that Stanley will be called Caveman and fixes the order of the line for water. X-Ray maintains his position as the leader of the boys even though he is one of the smallest and can barely see without his glasses. He convinces Stanley to give him the lipstick tube that Stanley finds in his hole so that he can have the day off instead of Stanley. X-Ray is able to maintain his position at the head of the group through a system of rewards and allies. Every time that Stanley does something nice for X-Ray, X-Ray is nice to Stanley and stands up for him when the other boys pick on him. When Stanley becomes friends with Zero, however, X-Ray's system is threatened and he becomes hostile towards Stanley. His nickname X-ray comes from it being [[pig Latin]] of his actual name, Rex.\n*'''Squid (Alan)''': Squid is a member of Group D at Camp Green Lake. He is often the one for taunting Stanley for sending and receiving letters to his mother. Just like X-Ray, Squid is very tough but very subservient to X-Ray's rules and directions.\n*'''Magnet (Jos\u00e9)''': Another member of Group D. Magnet earned his nickname because of his ability to steal, he got into Camp Green Lake for stealing animals from the zoo and refers to his fingers as \"little magnets\".\n*'''Armpit (Theodore Johnson)''': One of X-Ray's close friends at camp, he pushes Stanley when Stanley calls him Theodore. His nickname Armpit is due to him being stung by a scorpion at camp and the venom travelling up into his armpit, causing him to complain about his armpit hurting.\n*'''ZigZag (Ricky)''': Zigzag is described as being the tallest kid of Group D, constantly looking like he has been electrocuted, with frizzy hair. Stanley often thinks he is the weirdest and craziest kid at Camp Green Lake. Zigzag is the one who hit Stanley on the head with a shovel and did not apologise for doing so. Zigzag suffers from [[paranoia]], highlighting his displayed \"craziness\".\n*'''Twitch (Brian)''': A car thief who arrives at camp after Stanley.\n*'''The Warden (Ms. Walker)''': Running Camp Green Lake, she is known to be violent, abusive, and quite rude. She uses her power and privilege to get what she wants and make members of the camp do as she pleases. She has hidden cameras, using them to spy on the members of the camp. She is often thought to have hidden cameras in the showers, causing Stanley to be paranoid whenever he takes a shower, rushing out as fast as possible. She wears nail polish traced with rattlesnake venom, and scratches those who displease or go against what she says. She has the members of Camp Green Lake digging holes to look for Kate Barlow's hidden treasure. She is the granddaughter of Charles \"Trout\" Walker. Her family had been digging the treasure out since her birth, but to no success.\n*'''Mr. Sir (Marion Sevillo)''': One of the counselors at Camp Green Lake, he is constantly eating sunflower seeds. He took up this habit after deciding to quit smoking. He is known to be rude and tough.\n*'''Mr. Pendanski''': In Group D at Camp Green Lake Mr. Pendanski is in charge. Mr. Pendanski may seem friendly, but he is just as mean as the Warden and Mr. Sir. He never stops making fun of Zero ever since he has been at the camp, which comes back to bite him when the boy cracks him in the face with a shovel.\n\n===Town of Green Lake===\n* '''Katherine Barlow (Kissin' Kate Barlow)''': Katherine Barlow is a sweet and intelligent woman who teaches in a one-room school house on Green Lake one hundred and ten years before Stanley arrives at Camp Green Lake. She falls in love with Sam, a man who sells onions in the town. Although the rest of the white people in the town are racist and enforce rules that prohibit black people from going to school, Kate, who is white, does not care about the color of a person's skin and she loves Sam for the person that he is. When Kate and Sam kiss, the angry townsfolk kill Sam and destroy her beloved schoolhouse. Kate is devastated by Sam's death and becomes Kissin' Kate Barlow, one of the most feared outlaws in the West. She always leaves her mark by kissing someone when she finishes killing them; if she had only robbed them, she would leave them in the hot desert. She is the outlaw responsible for robbing Stanley Yelnats I (Stanley's ancestor). Kate dies when a yellow spotted lizard bites her foot, but dies laughing because the Walker family will never find her treasure. The lipstick tube that Stanley finds during his second week at Camp Green Lake was owned by Kate Barlow.\n*'''Sam''': Sam is an African-American farmer in the town Green Lake, Texas who grows onions. He believes onions are the cure to everything and makes many remedies from onions. He also has an immense love for his donkey, Mary Lou. His relationship with Kate begins when he exchanges his onions for some jars of peaches. He is murdered in cold blood by Charles \"Trout\" Walker.\n*'''Charles \"Trout\" Walker''': Charles \"Trout\" Walker is an extremely spoiled son of a rich family in Green Lake. He gets upset when Kate denies his request to date her. This adds on to the reason of causing him to lead the townspeople to burn down the schoolhouse and kill Sam. His nickname Trout comes from his foot fungus that causes his feet to smell like dead fish. After Kate leaves to become an outlaw, he marries Linda Miller but his family loses everything after the lake dries up. He is The Warden's grandfather, who upon his death, opens up the juvenile detention camp to increase the efficiency of finding Kate Barlow's hidden treasure.\n*'''Stanley Yelnats I''': Stanley Yelnats I is the son of Elya Yelnats as well as the great-grandfather of Stanley Yelnats IV. He was the one whose treasure was stolen by Kate Barlow while he was moving from New York to California. He is known to have survived by climbing to the top of a thumb-shaped mountain (God's Thumb) which happens to be Sam's old onion field.\n\n===Mid-1800s Latvia===\n*'''Elya Yelnats''': Elya is the great-great-grandfather of Stanley. He is often referred to as his \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather\", constantly being blamed for everything that goes wrong in Stanley's life.  He is considered to be the reason why the Yelnats family has such bad luck. After he fell in love with the woman in Latvia, he travels to America, forgetting to go through with the promise he made to an old woman named Madame Zeroni. This causes generations of bad luck to trickle down the Yelnats family tree. However, he does pass down an important song that Madame Zeroni taught him in Latvia.\n*'''Madame Zeroni''': Madame Zeroni is the great-great-great-grandmother of Hector Zeroni (Zero). She is great friends with Elya Yelnats, and she gives him a pig. Because Elya breaks his promise of carrying her to the top of the mountain, she is considered to be the one who put a \"curse\" on the Yelnats family.\n*'''Myra Menke''': Myra is the most beautiful girl in the Latvian village of Elya and Madame Zeroni. Madame Zeroni compares her to a flowerpot. Myra's father promised to award her hand in marriage to whichever suitor can raise the fattest pig. When the pigs were the same size, Myra asked Elya and Igor Barkov to guess a number between 1 and 10, showing her inability to make her own decisions.\n*'''Igor Barkov''': Igor was Elya's competitor for the hand of Myra Menke. He was already old and fat, but was a successful pig farmer.\n\n===Minor characters===\n*'''Mr. Yelnats (Stanley Yelnats III)''': Mr. Yelnats is Stanley's father. He is an inventor and quite smart, but extremely unlucky. He attempts to discover a way to recycle old sneakers and because of this, the Yelnats' apartment smells bad. However, he eventually discovers a cure to ridding foot odor and is able to hire a lawyer, Ms. Morengo, to get Stanley out of Camp Green Lake.\n*'''Mrs. Yelnats''': Mrs. Yelnats is Stanley's mother. She does not believe in curses but always points out the terrible luck that the Yelnats have.\n*'''Barf Bag (Louis)''': An inmate who left Camp Green Lake before Stanley arrived. He deliberately got a rattlesnake to bite him in order to be hospitalized.\n\n==Setting==\nCamp Green Lake is located on a dried-up lake in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sachar|first1=Louis|title=Holes|url=https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Yearling|location=New York|isbn=978-0440414803|page=[https://archive.org/details/holes00loui_4/page/n10 1]}}</ref> The name is a false description, as the area is a parched, barren desert. The only weather is scorching sun. No rain has fallen since the day Sam was murdered. The only plants mentioned are two oak trees in front of the Warden's cabin; the book notes that \"the Warden owns the shade.\" The abandoned town of Green Lake is located by the side of the lakebed. Camp Green Lake is a juvenile detention center, where inmates spend most of their time digging holes. The majority of the book alternates between the present day story of Stanley Yelnats, the story of Elya Yelnats in Latvia (mid-1800s) and the story of Katherine Barlow in the town of Green Lake (about a generation later). Later chapters focus less on the past stories.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Fairy tales ===\nThe themes typical of a folk or [[fairy tale]] are present throughout the novel, notable in both Stanley and Elya's narratives.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Elizabeth G.|date=2001|title=Holes: Folklore Redux|url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ALAN/v28n2/mascia.html|journal=The ALAN Review|volume=28| issue =  2|pages=51|via=|doi=10.21061/alan.v28i2.a.11}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Pinsent|first=Pat|date=2002-09-01|title=Fate and Fortune in a Modern Fairy Tale: Louis Sachar's Holes|journal=Children's Literature in Education|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=203\u2013212|doi=10.1023/A:1019682032315|issn=0045-6713}}</ref> Elya must go on an adventure to win his love's approval and prove his own worth and he is eventually placed under a witch's curse.

{"title_page": "Class (computer programming)", "text_new": "{{Original research|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn [[object-oriented programming]], a '''class''' is an extensible program-code-template for creating [[Object (object-oriented programming)|object]]s, providing initial values for state ([[member variable]]s) and implementations of behavior (member functions or [[Method (computer programming)|methods]]).{{sfn|Gamma|Helm|Johnson|Vlissides|1995| p=14}}{{sfn|Bruce|2002|loc=2.1 Objects, classes, and object types, {{Google books|9NGWq3K1RwUC|Objects, classes, and object types|page=18|plainurl=yes}}}} In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class (the template itself), the name for the default [[Constructor (object-oriented programming)|constructor]] of the class (a [[subroutine]] that creates objects), and as the [[data type|type]] of objects generated by [[Instance (computer science)|instantiating]] the class; these distinct concepts are easily conflated.{{sfn|Bruce|2002|loc=2.1 Objects, classes, and object types, {{Google books|9NGWq3K1RwUC|Objects, classes, and object types|page=18|plainurl=yes}}}}\n\nWhen an object is created by a constructor of the class, the resulting object is called an [[Instance (computer science)|instance]] of the class, and the member variables specific to the object are called [[instance variable]]s, to contrast with the [[class variable]]s shared across the class.\n\nIn some languages, classes are only a compile-time feature (new classes cannot be declared at run-time), while in other languages classes are [[first-class citizen]]s, and are generally themselves objects (typically of type {{Mono|Class}} or similar). In these languages, a class that creates classes is called a [[metaclass]].\n\n== Class vs. type ==\nIn casual use, people often refer to the \"class\" of an object, but narrowly speaking objects have ''type'': the interface, namely the types of member variables, the signatures of [[member function]]s (methods), and properties these satisfy. At the same time, a class has an implementation (specifically the implementation of the methods), and can create objects of a given type, with a given implementation.{{sfn|Gamma|Helm|Johnson|Vlissides|1995| p=17}} In the terms of type theory, a class is an implementation{{mdashb}}a ''concrete'' [[data structure]] and collection of subroutines{{mdashb}}while a type is an [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|interface]]. Different (concrete) classes can produce objects of the same (abstract) type (depending on type system); for example, the type {{Mono|Stack}} might be implemented with two classes{{snd}} {{Mono|SmallStack}} (fast for small stacks, but scales poorly) and {{Mono|ScalableStack}} (scales well but high overhead for small stacks). Similarly, a given class may have several different constructors.\n\nClass types generally represent nouns, such as a person, place or thing, or something [[Nominalization|nominalized]], and a class represents an implementation of these. For example, a {{Mono|Banana}} type might represent the properties and functionality of [[banana]]s in general, while the {{Mono|ABCBanana}} and {{Mono|XYZBanana}} classes would represent ways of producing bananas (say, banana suppliers or data structures and functions to represent and draw bananas in a video game). The {{Mono|ABCBanana}} class could then produce particular bananas: instances of the {{Mono|ABCBanana}} class would be objects of type {{Mono|Banana}}. Often only a single implementation of a type is given, in which case the class name is often identical with the type name.\n\n== Design and implementation ==\nClasses are composed from structural and behavioral constituents.{{sfn|Gamma et al.|1995| p=14}} <!-- though there may not be a requirement to include any constituents at all--> Programming languages that include classes as a programming construct offer support, for various class-related features, and the syntax required to use these features varies greatly from one programming language to another.\n\n=== {{Anchor|PROPERTY}}Structure ===\n[[File:oop-uml-class-example.png|frame|right|[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] notation for classes]]\n\nA class contains [[Data (computing)|data]] field descriptions (or ''[[property (programming)|properties]]'', ''[[field (computer science)|fields]]'', ''data [[member variable|members]]'', or ''[[attribute (computing)|attributes]]''). These are usually field types and names that will be associated with state variables at program run time; these state variables either belong to the class or specific instances of the class. In most languages, the structure defined by the class determines the layout of the memory used by its instances. Other implementations are possible: for example, objects in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] use associative key-value containers.<ref name=\"pythondata model\">{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html|title=3. Data model|work=The Python Language Reference|publisher=Python Software Foundation|accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n\nSome programming languages support specification of [[class invariant|invariant]]s as part of the definition of the class, and enforce them through the type system. [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|Encapsulation]] of state is necessary for being able to enforce the invariants of the class.\n\n=== Behavior ===\n{{Main|Method (computer programming)}}\n<!-- This section used to contain info on Java interfaces. If you wish to view it (to, say, move to another page), the last revision before the removal of this info is http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Class_(computer_science)&oldid=165562113 -->\n\nThe behavior of class or its instances is defined using [[Method (computer programming)|methods]]. Methods are [[subroutine]]s with the ability to operate on objects or classes. These operations may alter the state of an object or simply provide ways of accessing it.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=86-88}} <!-- (Note: Some languages allow direct access to instance variables ([[C++]])). --> Many kinds of methods exist, but support for them varies across languages. Some types of methods are created and called by programmer code, while other special methods\u2014such as constructors, destructors, and conversion operators\u2014are created and called by compiler-generated code. A language may also allow the programmer to define and call these special methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes/|title=Classes (I)|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes2/|title=Classes (II)|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref>\n\n=== The concept of class interface ===\n{{Main|Interface (computing)}}\n\nEvery class ''implements'' (or ''realizes'') an interface by providing [[#Structure|structure]] and behavior. Structure consists of data and state, and behavior consists of code that specifies how methods are implemented.{{sfn|Booch|1994|p=105}} There is a distinction between the definition of an interface and the implementation of that interface; however, this line is blurred in many programming languages because class declarations both define and implement an interface. Some languages, however, provide features that separate interface and implementation. For example, an [[#Abstract_and_Concrete|abstract class]] can define an interface without providing implementation.\n\nLanguages that support class inheritance also allow classes to inherit interfaces from the classes that they are derived from.\n\nFor example, if \"class A\" inherits from \"class B\" and if \"class B\" implements the interface \"interface B\" then \"class A\" also inherits the functionality(constants and methods declaration) provided by \"interface B\".\n\nIn languages that support [[#Information hiding and encapsulation|access specifiers]], the interface of a class is considered to be the set of public members of the class, including both methods and attributes (via implicit [[Mutator method|getter and setter methods]]); any private members or internal data structures are not intended to be depended on by external <!--client--> code and thus are not part of the interface.\n\nObject-oriented programming methodology <!--is designed in such a way--> dictates that the operations of any interface of a class are to be independent of each other. It results in a layered design where clients of an interface use the methods declared in the interface. An interface places no requirements for clients to invoke the operations of one interface in any particular order. This approach has the benefit that client code can assume that the operations of an interface are available for use whenever the client <!--holds a valid reference--> has access to the object.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New perspectives computer concepts, 2016. Comprehensive|last=Jamrich|first=Parsons, June|isbn=9781305271616|location=Boston, MA|oclc=917155105|date = 2015-06-22}}</ref> {{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for whole paragraph...this is a rather specific statement about OOP methodology.|date=April 2012}}\n\n==== Example ====\nThe buttons on the front of your television set are the interface between you and the electrical wiring on the other side of its plastic casing. You press the \"power\" button to toggle the television on and off. In this example, your particular television is the instance, each method is represented by a button, and all the buttons together compose the interface (other television sets that are the same model as yours would have the same interface). In its most common form, an interface is a specification of a group of related methods without any associated implementation of the methods.\n\nA television set also has a myriad of ''attributes'', such as size and whether it supports colour, which together comprise its structure. A class represents the full description of a television, including its attributes (structure) and buttons (interface).\n\nGetting the total number of televisions manufactured could be a ''static method'' of the television class. This method is clearly associated with the class, yet is outside the domain of each individual instance of the class. A static method that finds a particular instance out of the set of all television objects is another example.\n\n=== Member accessibility ===\n{{redirect|Private member|other uses|Private members club|and|Private member's bill}}\n{{Further|Information hiding}}\n\nThe following is a common set of [[access specifiers]]:<ref name=\"JavaAccessControl\">{{cite web| url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html|title=Controlling Access to Members of a Class|work=The Java Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2012-04-19}}</ref>\n\n* ''Private'' (or ''class-private'') restricts the access to the class itself. Only methods that are part of the same class can access private members.\n* ''Protected'' (or ''class-protected'') allows the class itself and all its subclasses to access the member.\n* ''Public'' means that any code can access the member by its name.\n\nAlthough many object-oriented languages support the above access specifiers, <!-- {{Citation needed|reason=This is fairly obvious, but it needs to be cited--could even use a few links even to articles within Wikipedia.|date=April 2012}} -->their semantics may differ.\n\nObject-oriented design uses the access specifiers in conjunction with careful design of public method implementations to enforce class invariants\u2014constraints on the state of the objects. A common usage of access specifiers is to separate the internal data of a class from its interface: the internal structure is made private, while public [[accessor method]]s can be used to inspect or alter such private data.\n\nAccess specifiers do not necessarily control ''visibility'', in that even private members may be visible to client external code. In some languages, an inaccessible but visible member may be referred to at run-time (for example, by a pointer returned from a member function), but an attempt to use it by referring to the name of the member from client code will be prevented by the type checker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/cplusplus/OOP08-CPP.+Do+not+return+references+to+private+data|title=OOP08-CPP.

For example, the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] language does not allow client code that accesses the private data of a class to compile.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11cheatsheet/errors.pdf|title=2.2 Identifiers|work=Compile and Runtime Errors in Java|first=Mordechai|last=Ben-Ari|date=2007-01-24|accessdate=2012-05-07}}</ref> <!-- whereas in languages like [[Objective-C]] or [[Perl]] client code is not restricted.--> In the [[C++]] language, private methods are visible, but not accessible in the interface; however, they may be made invisible by explicitly declaring fully abstract classes that represent the interfaces of the class.<ref name=\"cppinterface\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/184410630|title=C++ Interfaces|last=Wild|first=Fred|work=Dr. Dobb's|publisher=UBM Techweb|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>\n\nSome languages feature other accessibility schemes:\n* ''Instance vs. class accessibility'': [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] supports ''instance-private'' and ''instance-protected'' access specifiers in lieu of class-private and class-protected, respectively. They differ in that they restrict access based on the instance itself, rather than the instance's class.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_classes.html | title=Classes, Objects, and Variables|work=Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide | last=Thomas | last2=Hunt | publisher=Ruby-Doc.org | accessdate=2012-04-26}}\n</ref>\n* ''Friend'': C++ supports a mechanism where a function explicitly declared as a [[friend function]] of the class may access the members designated as private or protected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/inheritance/\n|title=Friendship and inheritance|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n* ''Path-based'': Java supports restricting access to a member within a [[Java syntax#Access modifiers|Java package]], which is the logical path of the file. However, it is a common practice when extending a Java framework to implement classes in the same package as a framework class in order to access protected members. The source file may exist in a completely different location, and may be deployed to a different .jar file, yet still be in the same logical path as far as the JVM is concerned.<ref name=JavaAccessControl />\n\n== Inter-class relationships ==\nIn addition to the design of standalone classes, programming languages may support more advanced class design based upon relationships between classes. The inter-class relationship design capabilities commonly provided are ''compositional'' and ''hierarchical''.\n\n=== Compositional ===\nClasses can be composed of other classes, thereby establishing a compositional relationship between the enclosing class and its embedded classes. Compositional relationship between classes is also commonly known as a ''[[has-a]]'' relationship.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=180}} For example, a class \"Car\" could be composed of and contain a class \"Engine\". Therefore, a Car ''has an'' Engine. One aspect of composition is containment, which is the enclosure of component instances by the instance that has them. If an enclosing object contains component instances by value, the components and their enclosing object have a similar [[Object lifetime|lifetime]]. If the components are contained by reference, they may not have a similar lifetime.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=128-129}} For example, in Objective-C 2.0:\n\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface Car : NSObject\n\n@property NSString *name;\n@property Engine *engine\n@property NSArray *tires;\n\n@end\n</source>\n\nThis {{Mono|Car}} class ''has'' an instance of {{Mono|NSString}} (a [[string (computer science)|string]] object), {{Mono|Engine}}, and {{Mono|NSArray}} (an array object).\n\n=== Hierarchical ===\nClasses can be ''derived'' from one or more existing classes, thereby establishing a hierarchical relationship between the derived-from classes (''base classes'', ''parent classes'' or ''{{vanchor|superclasses|SUPERCLASS}}'') and the derived class (''child class'' or ''subclass'') . The relationship of the derived class to the derived-from classes is commonly known as an '''[[is-a]]''' relationship.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=112}} For example, a class 'Button' could be derived from a class 'Control'. Therefore, a Button '''is a''' Control. Structural and behavioral members of the parent classes are ''inherited'' by the child class. Derived classes can define additional structural members (data fields) and behavioral members (methods) in addition to those that they ''inherit'' and are therefore ''specializations'' of their superclasses. Also, derived classes can [[method overriding|override]] inherited methods if the language allows.\n\nNot all languages support multiple inheritance. For example, Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces, but only inherit from one class.<ref name=\"javainterface\">{{cite web| url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html|title=Interfaces|work=The Java Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref> If multiple inheritance is allowed, the hierarchy is a [[directed acyclic graph]] (or DAG for short), otherwise it is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]. The hierarchy has classes as nodes and inheritance relationships as links. Classes in the same level are more likely to be [[association (object-oriented programming)|associated]] than classes in different levels. The levels of this hierarchy are called [[Layer (object-oriented design)|layers]] or [[level of abstraction|levels of abstraction]].\n\nExample (Simplified Objective-C 2.0 code, from iPhone SDK):\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface UIResponder : NSObject //...\n@interface UIView : UIResponder //...\n@interface UIScrollView : UIView //...\n@interface UITableView : UIScrollView //...\n</source>\nIn this example, a UITableView '''is a''' UIScrollView '''is a''' UIView '''is a''' UIResponder '''is an''' NSObject.\n\n==== Definitions of subclass ====\n{{Main|Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|Superclass (computer science)|Subclass (computer science)}}\nConceptually, a superclass is a [[superset]] of its subclasses. For example, a common class hierarchy would involve {{Mono|GraphicObject}} as a superclass of {{Mono|Rectangle}} and {{Mono|Ellipse}}, while {{Mono|Square}} would be a subclass of {{Mono|Rectangle}}. These are all [[Subset|subset relations]] in set theory as well, i.e., all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares.\n\nA common conceptual error is to mistake a ''part of'' relation with a subclass. For example, a car and truck are both kinds of vehicles and it would be appropriate to model them as subclasses of a vehicle class. However, it would be an error to model the component parts of the car as subclass relations. For example, a car is composed of an engine and body, but it would not be appropriate to model engine or body as a subclass of car.\n\nIn object-oriented modeling these kinds of relations are typically modeled as object properties. In this example, the {{Mono|Car}} class would have a property called {{Mono|parts}}. {{Mono|parts}} would be typed to hold a collection of objects, such as instances of {{Mono|Body}}, {{Mono|Engine}}, {{Mono|Tires}}, etc.\nObject modeling languages such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] include capabilities to model various aspects of \"part of\" and other kinds of relations \u2013 data such as the cardinality of the objects, constraints on input and output values, etc. This information can be utilized by developer tools to generate additional code beside the basic data definitions for the objects, such as error checking on [[Mutator method|get and set methods]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UML-to-Java transformation in IBM Rational Software Architect editions and related software|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/08/1202_berfeld/|publisher=[[IBM]]|date=2 December 2008|first=Marya|last=Berfeld|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nOne important question when modeling and implementing a system of object classes is whether a class can have one or more superclasses. In the real world with actual sets it would be rare to find sets that didn't intersect with more than one other set. However, while some systems such as Flavors and CLOS provide a capability for more than one parent to do so at run time introduces complexity that many in the object-oriented community consider antithetical to the goals of using object classes in the first place. Understanding which class will be responsible for handling a message can get complex when dealing with more than one superclass. If used carelessly this feature can introduce some of the same system complexity and ambiguity classes were designed to avoid.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Ivar|title=Object Oriented Software Engineering|year=1992|publisher=Addison-Wesley ACM Press|isbn=0-201-54435-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco/page/43 43\u201369]|author2=Magnus Christerson|author3=Patrik Jonsson|author4=Gunnar Overgaard|url=https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco/page/43}}</ref>\n\nMost modern object-oriented languages such as Smalltalk and Java require single inheritance at run time. For these languages, multiple inheritance may be useful for modeling but not for an implementation.\n\nHowever, [[semantic web]] application objects do have multiple superclasses. The volatility of the Internet requires this level of flexibility and the technology standards such as the [[Web Ontology Language|Web Ontology Language (OWL)]] are designed to support it.\n\nA similar issue is whether or not the class hierarchy can be modified at run time. Languages such as Flavors, CLOS, and Smalltalk all support this feature as part of their [[meta-object protocol]]s. Since classes are themselves first-class objects, it is possible to have them dynamically alter their structure by sending them the appropriate messages. Other languages that focus more on strong typing such as Java and C++ do not allow the class hierarchy to be modified at run time. Semantic web objects have the capability for run time changes to classes. The rational is similar to the justification for allowing multiple superclasses, that the Internet is so dynamic and flexible that dynamic changes to the hierarchy are required to manage this volatility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/SE/ODSD/|title=A Semantic Web Primer for Object-Oriented Software Developers|last1=Knublauch|first1=Holger|last2=Oberle|first2=Daniel|last3=Tetlow|first3=Phil|last4=Wallace|first4=Evan|publisher=[[W3C]]|date=2006-03-09|accessdate=2008-07-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Orthogonality of the class concept and inheritance ===\nAlthough class-based languages are commonly assumed to support inheritance, inheritance is not an intrinsic aspect of the concept of classes. Some languages, often referred to as \"[[object-based languages]]\", support classes yet do not support inheritance. Examples of object-based languages include earlier versions of [[Visual Basic]].<!-- do not provide the structural benefits of statically type-checked interfaces for objects. This is because in object-based languages, it is possible to use and extend data structures and attach methods to them at run-time. This precludes the compiler or interpreter being able to check the type information specified in the source code as the type is built dynamically and not defined statically. Most of these languages allow for ''instance behavior'' and complex ''operational polymorphism'' (see [[dynamic dispatch]] and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]). -->\n\n=== Within object-oriented analysis <!-- belongs in an Object-Oriented Analysis article--> ===\n{{Main|Association (object-oriented programming)}}<!--consider moving a bunch of stuff here to this page...-->\n\nIn [[object-oriented analysis and design|object-oriented analysis]] and in [[Unified Modelling Language|UML]], an '''association''' between two classes represents a collaboration between the classes or their corresponding instances. Associations have direction; for example, a bi-directional association between two classes indicates that both of the classes are aware of their relationship.<ref name=\"ibmuml\">{{cite web| url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/content/RationalEdge/sep04/bell/|title=UML Basics: The class diagram|last=Bell|first=Donald|work=developer Works|publisher=IBM|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref> Associations may be labeled according to their name or purpose.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=179}}\n\nAn association role is given end of an association and describes the role of the corresponding class. For example, a \"subscriber\" role describes the way instances of the class \"Person\" participate in a \"subscribes-to\" association with the class \"Magazine\". Also, a \"Magazine\" has the \"subscribed magazine\" role in the same association. Association role multiplicity describes how many instances correspond to each instance of the other class of the association. Common multiplicities are \"0..1\", \"1..1\", \"1..*\" and \"0..*\", where the \"*\" specifies any number of instances.<ref name=ibmuml />\n\n== Taxonomy of classes ==\nThere are many categories of classes, some of which overlap.\n\n=== {{Anchor|Abstract_and_concrete_classes|Abstract_and_Concrete}}Abstract and concrete ===\n{{Main|Abstract type}}\n\nIn a language that supports inheritance, an '''abstract class''', or ''abstract base class'' (ABC), is a class that cannot be instantiated because it is either labeled as abstract or it simply specifies [[abstract method]]s (or ''virtual methods''). An abstract class may provide implementations of some methods, and may also specify virtual methods via [[Type signature|signatures]] that are to be implemented by direct or indirect descendants of the abstract class. Before a class derived from an abstract class can be instantiated, all abstract methods of its parent classes must be implemented by some class in the derivation chain.<ref name=\"cpppoly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/polymorphism/\n|title=Polymorphism|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>\n\nMost object-oriented programming languages allow the programmer to specify which classes are considered abstract and will not allow these to be instantiated. For example, in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[PHP]], the keyword ''abstract'' is used.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html|title=Abstract Methods and Classes|work=The Java Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.abstract.php|title=Class Abstraction|work=PHP Manual|publisher=The PHP Group|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref> In [[C++]], an abstract class is a class having at least one abstract method given by the appropriate syntax in that language (a pure virtual function in C++ parlance).<ref name=cpppoly />\n\nA class consisting of only virtual methods is called a Pure Abstract Base Class (or ''Pure ABC'') in C++ and is also known as an ''interface'' by users of the language.<ref name=cppinterface /> Other languages, notably Java and C#, support a variant of abstract classes called an [[Interface (Java)|interface]] via a keyword in the language. In these languages, [[multiple inheritance]] is not allowed, but a class can implement multiple interfaces. Such a class can only contain abstract publicly accessible methods.<ref name=javainterface /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173156.aspx | title=Interfaces (C# Programming Guide) | work=C# Programming Guide | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=2013-08-15}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173149.aspx | title=Inheritance (C# Programming Guide) | work=C# Programming Guide | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=2012-05-02}}\n</ref>\n<!--Abstract classes defined as interfaces are a much more specific usage of the more general meaning of the term ''interface'', even as used in computer science, and the concept of interfaces has seen much usage and popularity within the realm of languages that support object-orientation.-->\n\nA '''concrete class''' is a class that can be [[Instantiation (computer science)|instantiated]], as opposed to abstract classes, which cannot. <!-- (In \"Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms\", James Coplien defines \"concrete class\" as a class that has implicitly generated or explicitly defined special member functions that enable a class object to behave as do built-in types. These \"concrete classes\", then, adhere to the \"Orthodox Canonical Form\". Many developers who first learned the term as such, way back then, still primarily use it that way). -->\n\n=== Local and inner ===\nIn some languages, classes can be declared in [[Scope (programming)|scopes]] other than the global scope. There are various types of such classes.\n\nAn '''[[inner class]]''' is a class defined within another class. The relationship between an inner class and its containing class can also be treated as another type of class association. An inner class is typically neither associated with instances of the enclosing class nor instantiated along with its enclosing class. Depending on language, it may or may not be possible to refer to the class from outside the enclosing class. A related concept is ''inner types'', also known as ''inner data type'' or ''nested type'', which is a generalization of the concept of inner classes. [[C++]] is an example of a language that supports both inner classes and inner types (via ''[[typedef]]'' declarations).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr061.htm | title=Nested classes (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr063.htm | title=Local type names (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}\n</ref>\n\nAnother type is a '''local class''', which is a class defined within a procedure or function. This limits references to the class name to within the scope where the class is declared. Depending on the semantic rules of the language, there may be additional restrictions on local classes compared to non-local ones. One common restriction is to disallow local class methods to access local variables of the enclosing function. For example, in C++, a local class may refer to static variables declared within its enclosing function, but may not access the function's automatic variables.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr062.htm | title=Local classes (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Metaclasses ===\n{{Main|Metaclass}}\n\nMetaclasses are classes whose instances are classes.{{sfn|Booch|1994|p=133-134}} A metaclass describes a common structure of a collection of classes and can implement a [[design pattern (computer science)|design pattern]] or describe particular kinds of classes.

Mixins are typically used to add the same methods to multiple classes; for example, a class {{Mono|UnicodeConversionMixin}} might provide a method called {{Mono|unicode_to_ascii}} when included in classes {{Mono|FileReader}} and {{Mono|WebPageScraper}} that do not share a common parent.\n\n=== Partial ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn languages supporting the feature, a '''partial class''' is a class whose definition may be split into multiple pieces, within a single [[source code|source-code]] file or across multiple files.<ref name=\"mspartial\">{{Citation|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods|title=Partial Classes and Methods|work=C# Programming Guide|date=2015-09-19|author1=mairaw|author2=BillWagner|author3=tompratt-AQ|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2018-08-08}}</ref> The pieces are merged at compile-time, making compiler output the same as for a non-partial class.\n\nThe primary motivation for introduction of partial classes is to facilitate the implementation of [[code generator]]s, such as [[visual designer]]s.<ref name=\"mspartial\"/> It is otherwise a challenge or compromise to develop code generators that can manage the generated code when it is interleaved within developer-written code. Using partial classes, a code generator can process a separate file or coarse-grained partial class within a file, and is thus alleviated from intricately interjecting generated code via extensive parsing, increasing compiler efficiency and eliminating the potential risk of corrupting developer code. In a simple implementation of partial classes, the compiler can perform a phase of [[precompilation]] where it \"unifies\" all the parts of a partial class. Then, compilation can proceed as usual.\n\nOther benefits and effects of the partial class feature include:\n\n* Enables separation of a class's interface and implementation code in a unique way.\n* Eases navigation through large classes within an [[source code editor|editor]].\n* Enables [[separation of concerns]], in a way similar to [[aspect-oriented programming]] but without using any extra tools.\n* Enables multiple developers to work on a single class concurrently without the need to merge individual code into one file at a later time. <!-- (This enabling may be considered by some or most to be a detriment rather than a benefit for SoC can apply to programmers also).-->\n\nPartial classes have existed in [[Smalltalk]] under the name of ''Class Extensions'' for considerable time. With the arrival of the [[.NET Framework|.NET framework 2]], [[Microsoft]] introduced partial classes, supported in both [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] 2.0 and [[Visual Basic .NET|Visual Basic 2005]]. [[WinRT]] also supports partial classes.\n\n==== Example in VB.NET ====\nThis simple example, written in [[Visual Basic .NET]], shows how parts of the same class are defined in two different files.\n;file1.vb:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nPartial Class MyClass\n    Private _name As String\nEnd Class\n</source>\n;file2.vb:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nPartial Class MyClass\n    Public Readonly Property Name() As String\n         Get\n             Return _name\n         End Get\n    End Property\nEnd Class\n</source>\nWhen compiled, the result is the same as if the two files were written as one, like this:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nClass MyClass\n    Private _name As String\n    Public Readonly Property Name() As String\n         Get\n             Return _name\n         End Get\n    End Property\nEnd Class\n</source>\n\n==== Example in Objective-C ====\nIn [[Objective-C]], partial classes, also known as '''categories''', may even spread over multiple libraries and executables, like the following example. But a key difference is that Objective-C's categories can overwrite definitions in another interface declaration, and that categories aren't equal to original class definition (the first requires the last).<ref name=\"appleCategories\">{{citation|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/CustomizingExistingClasses/CustomizingExistingClasses.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH6-SW1|title=Customizing Existing Classes|work=Programming with Objective-C|date=2014-09-17|author=Apple|publisher=Apple|accessdate=2018-08-08}}</ref> Instead, .NET partial class can't have conflicting definitions, and all partial definitions are equal to the others.<ref name=\"mspartial\"/>\n\nIn Foundation, header file NSData.h:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface NSData : NSObject\n\n- (id)initWithContentsOfURL:(NSURL *)URL;\n//...\n\n@end\n</source>\nIn user-supplied library, a separate binary from Foundation framework, header file NSData+base64.h:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\n@interface NSData (base64)\n\n- (NSString *)base64String;\n- (id)initWithBase64String:(NSString *)base64String;\n\n@end\n</source>\nAnd in an app, yet another separate binary file, source code file main.m:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n#import \"NSData+base64.h\"\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    if (argc < 2)\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    NSString *sourceURLString = [NSString stringWithCString:argv[1]];\n    NSData *data = [[NSData alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:sourceURLString]];\n    NSLog(@\"%@\", [data base64String]);\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n</source>\nThe dispatcher will find both methods called over the NSData instance and invoke both of them correctly.\n\n=== Uninstantiable ===\n'''Uninstantiable classes''' allow programmers to group together per-class fields and methods that are accessible at runtime without an instance of the class. Indeed, instantiation is prohibited for this kind of class.\n\nFor example, in C#, a class marked \"static\" can not be instantiated, can only have static members (fields, methods, other), may not have ''instance constructors'', and is ''sealed''.\n<ref>{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/79b3xss3(v=vs.100).aspx | title=Static Classes and Static Class Members (C# Programming Guide) | work=C# Programming Guide | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=2012-05-08}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Unnamed ===\nAn '''unnamed class''' or '''anonymous class''' is a class that is not bound to a name or identifier upon definition.

System analysts can talk to both developers and users using essentially the same vocabulary, talking about accounts, customers, bills, etc. Object classes often facilitate rapid development because most object-oriented environments come with powerful debugging and testing tools. Instances of classes can be inspected at run time to verify that the system is performing as expected. Also, rather than get dumps of core memory, most object-oriented environments have interpreted debugging capabilities so that the developer can analyze exactly where in the program the error occurred and can see which methods were called to which arguments and with what arguments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Booch|first=Grady|title=Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-201-89551-3|pages=1\u201328|url=http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-and-development/object/9780201895513|author2=Robert A.

When developers need to change the behavior of an object they can localize the change to just that object and its component parts. This reduces the potential for unwanted side effects from maintenance enhancements.\n\nSoftware re-use is also a major benefit of using Object classes. Classes facilitate re-use via inheritance and interfaces. When a new behavior is required it can often be achieved by creating a new class and having that class inherit the default behaviors and data of its superclass and then tailor some aspect of the behavior or data accordingly. Re-use via interfaces (also known as methods) occurs when another object wants to invoke (rather than create a new kind of) some object class. This method for re-use removes many of the common errors that can make their way into software when one program re-uses code from another.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Ivar|title=Object Oriented Software Engineering|year=1992|publisher=Addison-Wesley ACM Press|isbn=0-201-54435-0|author2=Magnus Christerson|author3=Patrik Jonsson|author4=Gunnar Overgaard|url=https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco}}</ref>\n\n== Run-time representation ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}\n\nAs a data type, a class is usually considered as a compile-time construct <ref>{{cite web |title=C++ International standard |url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4713.pdf |website=Working Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++ |publisher=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22 WG21 |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref>.

In these languages, a class that creates classes is called a [[metaclass]].\n\n== Class vs. type ==\nIn casual use, people often refer to the \"class\" of an object, but narrowly speaking objects have ''type'': the interface, namely the types of member variables, the signatures of [[member function]]s (methods), and properties these satisfy. At the same time, a class has an implementation (specifically the implementation of the methods), and can create objects of a given type, with a given implementation.{{sfn|Gamma|Helm|Johnson|Vlissides|1995| p=17}} In the terms of type theory, a class is an implementation{{mdashb}}a ''concrete'' [[data structure]] and collection of subroutines{{mdashb}}while a type is an [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|interface]]. Different (concrete) classes can produce objects of the same (abstract) type (depending on type system); for example, the type {{Mono|Stack}} might be implemented with two classes{{snd}} {{Mono|SmallStack}} (fast for small stacks, but scales poorly) and {{Mono|ScalableStack}} (scales well but high overhead for small stacks). Similarly, a given class may have several different constructors.\n\nTypes generally represent nouns, such as a person, place or thing, or something [[Nominalization|nominalized]], and a class represents an implementation of these. For example, a {{Mono|Banana}} type might represent the properties and functionality of [[banana]]s in general, while the {{Mono|ABCBanana}} and {{Mono|XYZBanana}} classes would represent ways of producing bananas (say, banana suppliers or data structures and functions to represent and draw bananas in a video game). The {{Mono|ABCBanana}} class could then produce particular bananas: instances of the {{Mono|ABCBanana}} class would be objects of type {{Mono|Banana}}. Often only a single implementation of a type is given, in which case the class name is often identical with the type name.\n\n== Design and implementation ==\nClasses are composed from structural and behavioral constituents.{{sfn|Gamma et al.|1995| p=14}} <!-- though there may not be a requirement to include any constituents at all--> Programming languages that include classes as a programming construct offer support, for various class-related features, and the syntax required to use these features varies greatly from one programming language to another.\n\n=== {{Anchor|PROPERTY}}Structure ===\n[[File:oop-uml-class-example.png|frame|right|[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] notation for classes]]\n\nA class contains [[Data (computing)|data]] field descriptions (or ''[[property (programming)|properties]]'', ''[[field (computer science)|fields]]'', ''data [[member variable|members]]'', or ''[[attribute (computing)|attributes]]''). These are usually field types and names that will be associated with state variables at program run time; these state variables either belong to the class or specific instances of the class. In most languages, the structure defined by the class determines the layout of the memory used by its instances. Other implementations are possible: for example, objects in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] use associative key-value containers.<ref name=\"pythondata model\">{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html|title=3. Data model|work=The Python Language Reference|publisher=Python Software Foundation|accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>\n\nSome programming languages support specification of [[class invariant|invariant]]s as part of the definition of the class, and enforce them through the type system. [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|Encapsulation]] of state is necessary for being able to enforce the invariants of the class.\n\n=== Behavior ===\n{{Main|Method (computer programming)}}\n<!-- This section used to contain info on Java interfaces.

Methods are [[subroutine]]s with the ability to operate on objects or classes. These operations may alter the state of an object or simply provide ways of accessing it.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=86-88}} <!-- (Note: Some languages allow direct access to instance variables ([[C++]])). --> Many kinds of methods exist, but support for them varies across languages. Some types of methods are created and called by programmer code, while other special methods\u2014such as constructors, destructors, and conversion operators\u2014are created and called by compiler-generated code. A language may also allow the programmer to define and call these special methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes/|title=Classes (I)|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes2/|title=Classes (II)|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref>\n\n=== The concept of class interface ===\n{{Main|Interface (computing)}}\n\nEvery class ''implements'' (or ''realizes'') an interface by providing [[#Structure|structure]] and behavior. Structure consists of data and state, and behavior consists of code that specifies how methods are implemented.{{sfn|Booch|1994|p=105}} There is a distinction between the definition of an interface and the implementation of that interface; however, this line is blurred in many programming languages because class declarations both define and implement an interface. Some languages, however, provide features that separate interface and implementation. For example, an [[#Abstract_and_Concrete|abstract class]] can define an interface without providing implementation.\n\nLanguages that support class inheritance also allow classes to inherit interfaces from the classes that they are derived from.\n\nFor example, if \"class A\" inherits from \"class B\" and if \"class B\" implements the interface \"interface B\" then \"class A\" also inherits the functionality(constants and methods declaration) provided by \"interface B\".\n\nIn languages that support [[#Information hiding and encapsulation|access specifiers]], the interface of a class is considered to be the set of public members of the class, including both methods and attributes (via implicit [[Mutator method|getter and setter methods]]); any private members or internal data structures are not intended to be depended on by external <!--client--> code and thus are not part of the interface.\n\nObject-oriented programming methodology <!--is designed in such a way--> dictates that the operations of any interface of a class are to be independent of each other. It results in a layered design where clients of an interface use the methods declared in the interface. An interface places no requirements for clients to invoke the operations of one interface in any particular order. This approach has the benefit that client code can assume that the operations of an interface are available for use whenever the client <!--holds a valid reference--> has access to the object.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New perspectives computer concepts, 2016.

You press the \"power\" button to toggle the television on and off. In this example, your particular television is the instance, each method is represented by a button, and all the buttons together compose the interface (other television sets that are the same model as yours would have the same interface). In its most common form, an interface is a specification of a group of related methods without any associated implementation of the methods.\n\nA television set also has a myriad of ''attributes'', such as size and whether it supports colour, which together comprise its structure. A class represents the full description of a television, including its attributes (structure) and buttons (interface).\n\nGetting the total number of televisions manufactured could be a ''static method'' of the television class. This method is clearly associated with the class, yet is outside the domain of each individual instance of the class. A static method that finds a particular instance out of the set of all television objects is another example.\n\n=== Member accessibility ===\n{{redirect|Private member|other uses|Private members club|and|Private member's bill}}\n{{Further|Information hiding}}\n\nThe following is a common set of [[access specifiers]]:<ref name=\"JavaAccessControl\">{{cite web| url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html|title=Controlling Access to Members of a Class|work=The Java Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2012-04-19}}</ref>\n\n* ''Private'' (or ''class-private'') restricts the access to the class itself. Only methods that are part of the same class can access private members.\n* ''Protected'' (or ''class-protected'') allows the class itself and all its subclasses to access the member.\n* ''Public'' means that any code can access the member by its name.\n\nAlthough many object-oriented languages support the above access specifiers, <!-- {{Citation needed|reason=This is fairly obvious, but it needs to be cited--could even use a few links even to articles within Wikipedia.|date=April 2012}} -->their semantics may differ.\n\nObject-oriented design uses the access specifiers in conjunction with careful design of public method implementations to enforce class invariants\u2014constraints on the state of the objects. A common usage of access specifiers is to separate the internal data of a class from its interface: the internal structure is made private, while public [[accessor method]]s can be used to inspect or alter such private data.\n\nAccess specifiers do not necessarily control ''visibility'', in that even private members may be visible to client external code. In some languages, an inaccessible but visible member may be referred to at run-time (for example, by a pointer returned from a member function), but an attempt to use it by referring to the name of the member from client code will be prevented by the type checker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/cplusplus/OOP08-CPP.+Do+not+return+references+to+private+data|title=OOP08-CPP.

However, it is a common practice when extending a Java framework to implement classes in the same package as a framework class in order to access protected members. The source file may exist in a completely different location, and may be deployed to a different .jar file, yet still be in the same logical path as far as the JVM is concerned.<ref name=JavaAccessControl />\n\n== Inter-class relationships ==\nIn addition to the design of standalone classes, programming languages may support more advanced class design based upon relationships between classes. The inter-class relationship design capabilities commonly provided are ''compositional'' and ''hierarchical''.\n\n=== Compositional ===\nClasses can be composed of other classes, thereby establishing a compositional relationship between the enclosing class and its embedded classes. Compositional relationship between classes is also commonly known as a ''[[has-a]]'' relationship.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=180}} For example, a class \"Car\" could be composed of and contain a class \"Engine\". Therefore, a Car ''has an'' Engine. One aspect of composition is containment, which is the enclosure of component instances by the instance that has them. If an enclosing object contains component instances by value, the components and their enclosing object have a similar [[Object lifetime|lifetime]]. If the components are contained by reference, they may not have a similar lifetime.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=128-129}} For example, in Objective-C 2.0:\n\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface Car : NSObject\n\n@property NSString *name;\n@property Engine *engine\n@property NSArray *tires;\n\n@end\n</source>\n\nThis {{Mono|Car}} class ''has'' an instance of {{Mono|NSString}} (a [[string (computer science)|string]] object), {{Mono|Engine}}, and {{Mono|NSArray}} (an array object).\n\n=== Hierarchical ===\nClasses can be ''derived'' from one or more existing classes, thereby establishing a hierarchical relationship between the derived-from classes (''base classes'', ''parent classes'' or ''{{vanchor|superclasses|SUPERCLASS}}'') and the derived class (''child class'' or ''subclass'') . The relationship of the derived class to the derived-from classes is commonly known as an '''[[is-a]]''' relationship.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=112}} For example, a class 'Button' could be derived from a class 'Control'. Therefore, a Button '''is a''' Control. Structural and behavioral members of the parent classes are ''inherited'' by the child class. Derived classes can define additional structural members (data fields) and behavioral members (methods) in addition to those that they ''inherit'' and are therefore ''specializations'' of their superclasses. Also, derived classes can [[method overriding|override]] inherited methods if the language allows.\n\nNot all languages support multiple inheritance. For example, Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces, but only inherit from one class.<ref name=\"javainterface\">{{cite web| url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html|title=Interfaces|work=The Java Tutorials|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2012-05-01}}</ref> If multiple inheritance is allowed, the hierarchy is a [[directed acyclic graph]] (or DAG for short), otherwise it is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]. The hierarchy has classes as nodes and inheritance relationships as links. Classes in the same level are more likely to be [[association (object-oriented programming)|associated]] than classes in different levels. The levels of this hierarchy are called [[Layer (object-oriented design)|layers]] or [[level of abstraction|levels of abstraction]].\n\nExample (Simplified Objective-C 2.0 code, from iPhone SDK):\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface UIResponder : NSObject //...\n@interface UIView : UIResponder //...\n@interface UIScrollView : UIView //...\n@interface UITableView : UIScrollView //...\n</source>\nIn this example, a UITableView '''is a''' UIScrollView '''is a''' UIView '''is a''' UIResponder '''is an''' NSObject.\n\n==== Definitions of subclass ====\n{{Main|Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|Superclass (computer science)|Subclass (computer science)}}\nConceptually, a superclass is a [[superset]] of its subclasses. For example, a common class hierarchy would involve {{Mono|GraphicObject}} as a superclass of {{Mono|Rectangle}} and {{Mono|Ellipse}}, while {{Mono|Square}} would be a subclass of {{Mono|Rectangle}}. These are all [[Subset|subset relations]] in set theory as well, i.e., all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares.\n\nA common conceptual error is to mistake a ''part of'' relation with a subclass. For example, a car and truck are both kinds of vehicles and it would be appropriate to model them as subclasses of a vehicle class. However, it would be an error to model the component parts of the car as subclass relations. For example, a car is composed of an engine and body, but it would not be appropriate to model engine or body as a subclass of car.\n\nIn object-oriented modeling these kinds of relations are typically modeled as object properties. In this example, the {{Mono|Car}} class would have a property called {{Mono|parts}}. {{Mono|parts}} would be typed to hold a collection of objects, such as instances of {{Mono|Body}}, {{Mono|Engine}}, {{Mono|Tires}}, etc.\nObject modeling languages such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] include capabilities to model various aspects of \"part of\" and other kinds of relations \u2013 data such as the cardinality of the objects, constraints on input and output values, etc. This information can be utilized by developer tools to generate additional code beside the basic data definitions for the objects, such as error checking on [[Mutator method|get and set methods]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UML-to-Java transformation in IBM Rational Software Architect editions and related software|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/08/1202_berfeld/|publisher=[[IBM]]|date=2 December 2008|first=Marya|last=Berfeld|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nOne important question when modeling and implementing a system of object classes is whether a class can have one or more superclasses. In the real world with actual sets it would be rare to find sets that didn't intersect with more than one other set. However, while some systems such as Flavors and CLOS provide a capability for more than one parent to do so at run time introduces complexity that many in the object-oriented community consider antithetical to the goals of using object classes in the first place. Understanding which class will be responsible for handling a message can get complex when dealing with more than one superclass.

For these languages, multiple inheritance may be useful for modeling but not for an implementation.\n\nHowever, [[semantic web]] application objects do have multiple superclasses. The volatility of the Internet requires this level of flexibility and the technology standards such as the [[Web Ontology Language|Web Ontology Language (OWL)]] are designed to support it.\n\nA similar issue is whether or not the class hierarchy can be modified at run time. Languages such as Flavors, CLOS, and Smalltalk all support this feature as part of their [[meta-object protocol]]s. Since classes are themselves first-class objects, it is possible to have them dynamically alter their structure by sending them the appropriate messages. Other languages that focus more on strong typing such as Java and C++ do not allow the class hierarchy to be modified at run time. Semantic web objects have the capability for run time changes to classes. The rational is similar to the justification for allowing multiple superclasses, that the Internet is so dynamic and flexible that dynamic changes to the hierarchy are required to manage this volatility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/SE/ODSD/|title=A Semantic Web Primer for Object-Oriented Software Developers|last1=Knublauch|first1=Holger|last2=Oberle|first2=Daniel|last3=Tetlow|first3=Phil|last4=Wallace|first4=Evan|publisher=[[W3C]]|date=2006-03-09|accessdate=2008-07-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Orthogonality of the class concept and inheritance ===\nAlthough class-based languages are commonly assumed to support inheritance, inheritance is not an intrinsic aspect of the concept of classes. Some languages, often referred to as \"[[object-based languages]]\", support classes yet do not support inheritance. Examples of object-based languages include earlier versions of [[Visual Basic]].<!-- do not provide the structural benefits of statically type-checked interfaces for objects. This is because in object-based languages, it is possible to use and extend data structures and attach methods to them at run-time. This precludes the compiler or interpreter being able to check the type information specified in the source code as the type is built dynamically and not defined statically. Most of these languages allow for ''instance behavior'' and complex ''operational polymorphism'' (see [[dynamic dispatch]] and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]). -->\n\n=== Within object-oriented analysis <!-- belongs in an Object-Oriented Analysis article--> ===\n{{Main|Association (object-oriented programming)}}<!--consider moving a bunch of stuff here to this page...-->\n\nIn [[object-oriented analysis and design|object-oriented analysis]] and in [[Unified Modelling Language|UML]], an '''association''' between two classes represents a collaboration between the classes or their corresponding instances. Associations have direction; for example, a bi-directional association between two classes indicates that both of the classes are aware of their relationship.<ref name=\"ibmuml\">{{cite web| url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/content/RationalEdge/sep04/bell/|title=UML Basics: The class diagram|last=Bell|first=Donald|work=developer Works|publisher=IBM|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref> Associations may be labeled according to their name or purpose.{{sfn|Booch|1994| p=179}}\n\nAn association role is given end of an association and describes the role of the corresponding class. For example, a \"subscriber\" role describes the way instances of the class \"Person\" participate in a \"subscribes-to\" association with the class \"Magazine\". Also, a \"Magazine\" has the \"subscribed magazine\" role in the same association. Association role multiplicity describes how many instances correspond to each instance of the other class of the association. Common multiplicities are \"0..1\", \"1..1\", \"1..*\" and \"0..*\", where the \"*\" specifies any number of instances.<ref name=ibmuml />\n\n== Taxonomy of classes ==\nThere are many categories of classes, some of which overlap.\n\n=== {{Anchor|Abstract_and_concrete_classes|Abstract_and_Concrete}}Abstract and concrete ===\n{{Main|Abstract type}}\n\nIn a language that supports inheritance, an '''abstract class''', or ''abstract base class'' (ABC), is a class that cannot be instantiated because it is either labeled as abstract or it simply specifies [[abstract method]]s (or ''virtual methods''). An abstract class may provide implementations of some methods, and may also specify virtual methods via [[Type signature|signatures]] that are to be implemented by direct or indirect descendants of the abstract class. Before a class derived from an abstract class can be instantiated, all abstract methods of its parent classes must be implemented by some class in the derivation chain.<ref name=\"cpppoly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/polymorphism/\n|title=Polymorphism|work=C++ Language Tutorial|publisher=cplusplus.com|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>\n\nMost object-oriented programming languages allow the programmer to specify which classes are considered abstract and will not allow these to be instantiated.

In these languages, [[multiple inheritance]] is not allowed, but a class can implement multiple interfaces.

These \"concrete classes\", then, adhere to the \"Orthodox Canonical Form\". Many developers who first learned the term as such, way back then, still primarily use it that way). -->\n\n=== Local and inner ===\nIn some languages, classes can be declared in [[Scope (programming)|scopes]] other than the global scope. There are various types of such classes.\n\nAn '''[[inner class]]''' is a class defined within another class. The relationship between an inner class and its containing class can also be treated as another type of class association. An inner class is typically neither associated with instances of the enclosing class nor instantiated along with its enclosing class. Depending on language, it may or may not be possible to refer to the class from outside the enclosing class. A related concept is ''inner types'', also known as ''inner data type'' or ''nested type'', which is a generalization of the concept of inner classes. [[C++]] is an example of a language that supports both inner classes and inner types (via ''[[typedef]]'' declarations).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr061.htm | title=Nested classes (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr063.htm | title=Local type names (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}\n</ref>\n\nAnother type is a '''local class''', which is a class defined within a procedure or function. This limits references to the class name to within the scope where the class is declared. Depending on the semantic rules of the language, there may be additional restrictions on local classes compared to non-local ones. One common restriction is to disallow local class methods to access local variables of the enclosing function. For example, in C++, a local class may refer to static variables declared within its enclosing function, but may not access the function's automatic variables.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr062.htm | title=Local classes (C++ only) | work=XL C/C++ V8.0 for AIX | publisher=IBM | accessdate=2012-05-07\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Metaclasses ===\n{{Main|Metaclass}}\n\nMetaclasses are classes whose instances are classes.{{sfn|Booch|1994|p=133-134}} A metaclass describes a common structure of a collection of classes and can implement a [[design pattern (computer science)|design pattern]] or describe particular kinds of classes.

Mixins are typically used to add the same methods to multiple classes; for example, a class {{Mono|UnicodeConversionMixin}} might provide a method called {{Mono|unicode_to_ascii}} when included in classes {{Mono|FileReader}} and {{Mono|WebPageScraper}} that do not share a common parent.\n\n=== Partial ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn languages supporting the feature, a '''partial class''' is a class whose definition may be split into multiple pieces, within a single [[source code|source-code]] file or across multiple files.<ref name=\"mspartial\">{{Citation|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods|title=Partial Classes and Methods|work=C# Programming Guide|date=2015-09-19|author1=mairaw|author2=BillWagner|author3=tompratt-AQ|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2018-08-08}}</ref> The pieces are merged at compile-time, making compiler output the same as for a non-partial class.\n\nThe primary motivation for introduction of partial classes is to facilitate the implementation of [[code generator]]s, such as [[visual designer]]s.<ref name=\"mspartial\"/> It is otherwise a challenge or compromise to develop code generators that can manage the generated code when it is interleaved within developer-written code. Using partial classes, a code generator can process a separate file or coarse-grained partial class within a file, and is thus alleviated from intricately interjecting generated code via extensive parsing, increasing compiler efficiency and eliminating the potential risk of corrupting developer code. In a simple implementation of partial classes, the compiler can perform a phase of [[precompilation]] where it \"unifies\" all the parts of a partial class. Then, compilation can proceed as usual.\n\nOther benefits and effects of the partial class feature include:\n\n* Enables separation of a class's interface and implementation code in a unique way.\n* Eases navigation through large classes within an [[source code editor|editor]].\n* Enables [[separation of concerns]], in a way similar to [[aspect-oriented programming]] but without using any extra tools.\n* Enables multiple developers to work on a single class concurrently without the need to merge individual code into one file at a later time. <!-- (This enabling may be considered by some or most to be a detriment rather than a benefit for SoC can apply to programmers also).-->\n\nPartial classes have existed in [[Smalltalk]] under the name of ''Class Extensions'' for considerable time. With the arrival of the [[.NET Framework|.NET framework 2]], [[Microsoft]] introduced partial classes, supported in both [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] 2.0 and [[Visual Basic .NET|Visual Basic 2005]]. [[WinRT]] also supports partial classes.\n\n==== Example in VB.NET ====\nThis simple example, written in [[Visual Basic .NET]], shows how parts of the same class are defined in two different files.\n;file1.vb:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nPartial Class MyClass\n    Private _name As String\nEnd Class\n</source>\n;file2.vb:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nPartial Class MyClass\n    Public Readonly Property Name() As String\n         Get\n             Return _name\n         End Get\n    End Property\nEnd Class\n</source>\nWhen compiled, the result is the same as if the two files were written as one, like this:\n<source lang=\"vbnet\">\nClass MyClass\n    Private _name As String\n    Public Readonly Property Name() As String\n         Get\n             Return _name\n         End Get\n    End Property\nEnd Class\n</source>\n\n==== Example in Objective-C ====\nIn [[Objective-C]], partial classes, also known as '''categories''', may even spread over multiple libraries and executables, like the following example. But a key difference is that Objective-C's categories can overwrite definitions in another interface declaration, and that categories aren't equal to original class definition (the first requires the last).<ref name=\"appleCategories\">{{citation|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/CustomizingExistingClasses/CustomizingExistingClasses.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH6-SW1|title=Customizing Existing Classes|work=Programming with Objective-C|date=2014-09-17|author=Apple|publisher=Apple|accessdate=2018-08-08}}</ref> Instead, .NET partial class can't have conflicting definitions, and all partial definitions are equal to the others.<ref name=\"mspartial\"/>\n\nIn Foundation, header file NSData.h:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n@interface NSData : NSObject\n\n- (id)initWithContentsOfURL:(NSURL *)URL;\n//...\n\n@end\n</source>\nIn user-supplied library, a separate binary from Foundation framework, header file NSData+base64.h:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n\n@interface NSData (base64)\n\n- (NSString *)base64String;\n- (id)initWithBase64String:(NSString *)base64String;\n\n@end\n</source>\nAnd in an app, yet another separate binary file, source code file main.m:\n<source lang=\"objc\">\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>\n#import \"NSData+base64.h\"\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    if (argc < 2)\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    NSString *sourceURLString = [NSString stringWithCString:argv[1]];\n    NSData *data = [[NSData alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:sourceURLString]];\n    NSLog(@\"%@\", [data base64String]);\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n</source>\nThe dispatcher will find both methods called over the NSData instance and invoke both of them correctly.\n\n=== Uninstantiable ===\n'''Uninstantiable classes''' allow programmers to group together per-class fields and methods that are accessible at runtime without an instance of the class. Indeed, instantiation is prohibited for this kind of class.\n\nFor example, in C#, a class marked \"static\" can not be instantiated, can only have static members (fields, methods, other), may not have ''instance constructors'', and is ''sealed''.\n<ref>{{cite web | url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/79b3xss3(v=vs.100).aspx | title=Static Classes and Static Class Members (C# Programming Guide) | work=C# Programming Guide | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=2012-05-08}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Unnamed ===\nAn '''unnamed class''' or '''anonymous class''' is a class that is not bound to a name or identifier upon definition.

System analysts can talk to both developers and users using essentially the same vocabulary, talking about accounts, customers, bills, etc. Object classes often facilitate rapid development because most object-oriented environments come with powerful debugging and testing tools. Instances of classes can be inspected at run time to verify that the system is performing as expected. Also, rather than get dumps of core memory, most object-oriented environments have interpreted debugging capabilities so that the developer can analyze exactly where in the program the error occurred and can see which methods were called to which arguments and with what arguments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Booch|first=Grady|title=Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-201-89551-3|pages=1\u201328|url=http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-and-development/object/9780201895513|author2=Robert A.

When developers need to change the behavior of an object they can localize the change to just that object and its component parts. This reduces the potential for unwanted side effects from maintenance enhancements.\n\nSoftware re-use is also a major benefit of using Object classes. Classes facilitate re-use via inheritance and interfaces. When a new behavior is required it can often be achieved by creating a new class and having that class inherit the default behaviors and data of its superclass and then tailor some aspect of the behavior or data accordingly. Re-use via interfaces (also known as methods) occurs when another object wants to invoke (rather than create a new kind of) some object class. This method for re-use removes many of the common errors that can make their way into software when one program re-uses code from another.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Ivar|title=Object Oriented Software Engineering|year=1992|publisher=Addison-Wesley ACM Press|isbn=0-201-54435-0|author2=Magnus Christerson|author3=Patrik Jonsson|author4=Gunnar Overgaard|url=https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco}}</ref>\n\n== Run-time representation ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}\n\nAs a data type, a class is usually considered as a compile-time construct <ref>{{cite web |title=C++ International standard |url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4713.pdf |website=Working Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++ |publisher=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22 WG21 |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref>.

Many languages distinguish this kind of [[run-time type information]] about classes from a class on the basis that the information is not needed at run-time. Some dynamic languages do not make strict distinctions between run-time and compile-time constructs, and therefore may not distinguish between metaobjects and classes.\n\nFor example, if Human is a [[metaobject]] representing the class Person, then instances of class Person can be created by using the facilities of the Human [[metaobject]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n\n* [[Class-based programming]]\n* [[Class diagram]] (UML)\n* [[List of object-oriented programming languages]]\n* [[Mixin]]\n* [[Object-oriented programming]]\n* [[Prototype-based programming]]\n* [[Trait (computer programming)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | ref = harv | last = Booch | first = Grady | year = 1994 | title = Objects and Design with Applications, Second Edition | publisher = Benjamin/Cummings\n}}\n* {{cite book | ref = harv | last = Gamma | last2 = Helm | last3 = Johnson | last4 = Vlissides | year = 1995 | title = Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software | url = https://archive.org/details/designpatternsel00gamm | url-access = registration | publisher = Addison Wesley\n}}\n* {{cite book | isbn = 978-0-262-02523-2 | title = Foundations of Object-Oriented Languages: Types and Semantics | last = Bruce | first = Kim B. | year = 2002 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, MA | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/foundations-object-oriented-languages}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://lucacardelli.name/TheoryOfObjects.html Abadi; Cardelli: A Theory of Objects]\n* [http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/ ISO/IEC 14882:2003 Programming Language C++, International standard]\n* [http://www.laputan.org/reflection/warfare.html Class Warfare: Classes vs. Prototypes], by Brian Foote\n* Meyer, B.: \"Object-oriented software construction\", 2nd edition, Prentice Hall, 1997, {{ISBN|0-13-629155-4}}\n* Rumbaugh et al.: \"Object-oriented modeling and design\", Prentice Hall, 1991, {{ISBN|0-13-630054-5}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite web| title=Programming demo - .NET using Partial Types for better code | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaw8K8GNhAI | work=Hyper/Net | publisher=Youtube|date=October 2006| last=Dias| first=Tiago}}\n\n{{Programming language}}\n{{Data types}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Class (Computer Programming)}}\n[[Category:Class (computer programming)| ]]\n[[Category:Programming constructs]]\n[[Category:Programming language topics]]\n", "name_user": "Esap", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eClass vs. type:fix too general claim", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)"}

In 1948 the Swedish flag carrier AB [[Aerotransport]] joined SAS and the companies coordinated European operations and finally merged to form the SAS Consortium in 1951. When established, the airline was divided between SAS Danmark (28.6%), SAS Norge (28.6%), and SAS Sverige (42.8%), all owned 50% by private investors and 50% by their governments.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The SAS Saga: A History of Scandinavian Airlines System|last=Buraas|first=Anders|publisher=SAS|year=1979|isbn=8290212003|location=|pages=13}}</ref>\n\n=== Transpolar route ===\nIn 1954 SAS was the first airline to start scheduled flights on a [[polar route]]. The [[Douglas DC-6|Douglas DC-6B]] flew from Copenhagen to Los Angeles with stops in S\u00f8ndre Str\u00f8mfjord (now [[Kangerlussuaq]]) in Greenland and Winnipeg in Canada. By summer 1956 frequency had increased to three flights per week. It was popular with Hollywood celebrities and film industry people, and the route turned out to be a publicity coup for SAS. Thanks to a [[tariff]] structure that allowed free transit to other European destinations via Copenhagen, this trans-polar route gained increasing popularity with American tourists throughout the 1950s. In 1957 SAS started a second polar route when a [[Douglas DC-7|Douglas DC-7C]] flew from Copenhagen to Tokyo via [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport|Anchorage International Airport]] in Alaska. The flight via Alaska was a compromise solution since the [[Soviet Union]] would not allow SAS, among other air carriers, to fly across [[Siberia]] between Europe and Japan, and Chinese airspace was also closed.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Jet era ===\n[[File:SAS Royal Hotel, Copenhagen, 1955-1960.jpg|thumb|Radisson Blu Royal Hotel in central [[Copenhagen]], originally SAS Royal Hotel, designed by [[Arne Jacobsen]] and built in 1960.]]\nSAS entered the jet age in 1959 when the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] entered service, with the [[Douglas DC-8]] then joining the fleet the next year. In 1971, SAS put its first [[Boeing 747]] jumbo jet into service.<ref>{{cite web|title=SAS timeline More than 60 years in the sky|url=https://www.flysas.com/upload/International/SKI/Media-center/Mediakit/Oct09/SAS%20timeline.pdf|website=flysas.com|accessdate=2 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring its first decades, the airline built two large hotels in central Copenhagen, SAS Royal Hotel (5 stars) and the even larger SAS Hotel Scandinavia (4 stars, with a casino on the 26th floor). After the deregulation of European commercial aviation and the crisis afterwards which affected SAS, like many other national airline corporations, Scandinavian Airlines sold its hotels to Radisson.\n[[File:SAS 1980s logo.svg|thumb|right|The company logo in the 1980s was made up of stripes in the colours of the flags of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden]]\n[[File:Scandinavian 767-383ER.jpg|thumb|right|SAS operated flights to Greenland for more than 50 years until March 2003.

In 1989, SAS acquired 18.4% of Texas Air Corporation, the parent company of [[Continental Airlines]], in a bid to form a global alliance. This stake was later sold. During the 1990s, SAS also bought a 20% stake in British Midland. SAS bought 95% of [[Spanair]], the second-largest airline in Spain, as well as [[Air Greenland]]. An agreement to divest more than 80 percent of the holdings in Spanair was signed with a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] group of investors led by Consorci de Turisme de Barcelona and Catalana d'Inciatives in January 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cisionwire.se/sas/avtal-om-forsaljning-av-spanair-har-ingatts|title=SAS \u2013 press release (in Swedish)|publisher=Cision Wire|accessdate=2009-01-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715074850/http://www.cisionwire.se/sas/avtal-om-forsaljning-av-spanair-har-ingatts|archivedate=15 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Star Alliance founding member ===\nIn May 1997, SAS formed the global [[Star Alliance]] network with [[Air Canada]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Thai Airways International]], and [[United Airlines]]. Four years earlier SAS unsuccessfully tried to merge with [[KLM]], Star Alliance partner [[Austrian Airlines]], and the now-defunct [[Swissair]], in a project called [[Alcazar (airline)|Alcazar]]. This failure led to the departure the following year of CEO [[Jan Carlzon]], who was credited for the financial turnaround of the company starting in 1981 and who envisioned SAS ownership of multiple airlines worldwide. The ownership structure of SAS was changed in June 2001, with a holding company being created in which the holdings of the governments changed to Sweden (21.4%), Norway (14.3%), and Denmark (14.3%) and the remaining 50% publicly held and traded on the stock market.\n\n=== Recent history (2004\u2013present) ===\nIn 2004 Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) was divided into four companies; SAS Scandinavian Airlines Sverige AB, SAS Scandinavian Airlines Danmark A/S, SAS Braathens AS, and SAS Scandinavian International AS. SAS Braathens was re-branded SAS Scandinavian Airlines Norge AS in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=147353|title=Press Release: SAS Braathens to be renamed SAS Norge|publisher=Waymaker (via SAS Group Press Release Archive)|accessdate=2010-03-23}}</ref> In October 2009 the four companies were once again united into one company, SAS Scandinavian System AB.\n\nWith the coming of low-cost airlines and decreasing fares in Scandinavia, the business turned into the red. To be profitable again, the airline had to cut costs. In a first step, the airline sold its stakes in other companies, such as [[British Midland International]], Spanair, and [[airBaltic]], and began to restructure its operations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/sas-sells-remaining-stake-in-bmi-to-lufthansa/|title=SAS Sells Remaining Stake in BMI to Lufthansa|last=Nicholson|first=Chris V. |date=1 October 2009|work=New York Times|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/30/spanair-idUSLU68460220090130|title=SAS sells Spanair for 1 euro, takes big charge|last=Roberts|first=Martin|date=30 January 2009|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=18 November 2012|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbaltic.com/public/company_history.html|title=Company history|work=airBaltic.com|publisher=airBaltic|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> This was to save costs by about 23 percent between 2008 and 2011. In November 2012 the company came under heavy pressure from its owners and banks to implement even heavier cost-cutting measures as a condition for continued financial support. Negotiations with the respective [[trade union]]s took place for more than a week and exceeded the original deadline, but in the end, SAS and the trade unions reached an agreement that would increase the work time, cutting salary between 12-20%, pension, and retirement plans, and thus keep the airline flying.

The first new long haul aircraft to enter service will be the A330-300E, which were originally planned to replace the aging A340-300s in 2015 as leasing agreements on these aircraft expire. Instead, SAS renewed the leasing agreements to be able to expand its long-haul fleet and used the new A330-300Es to add more long-haul destinations to its network. The A350-900 is planned to enter service in November 2019. SAS has dubbed this \"a total renewal of long haul fleet\", indicating that all former A340 and A330 will be replaced, although the total renewal could also refer to the new interior in the long haul fleet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=269175 |title=SAS Group - Press |publisher=Se.yhp.waymaker.net |date=2013-06-25 |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref>\n\nThe first of 8 Airbus A350-900s for SAS is expected to be delivered to the airline before the end of 2019 and to start to operate long haul routes from 28 January 2020.<ref>{{cite journal |title=SAS Scandinavian Airlines |journal=Airliner World |volume=August 2019 |page=11}}</ref> The A350 will first fly on the [[Copenhagen Airport|Copenhagen]] and [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]] route, with the airline planning [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Beijing]], [[Newark Liberty International Airport|New York]], [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo]], [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong]] and [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]] when more A350 are delivered in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sasgroup.net/en/sas-announces-first-a350-flights-and-features/|accessdate=25 October 2019|title=SAS announces first A350 flights and features}}</ref>\n\n===Removal of SAS Q400 fleet===\n{{Main|Dash 8 landing gear incidents}}\n[[File:Sas oy-kfe cr9.jpg|thumb|A [[Bombardier CRJ700#CRJ900|Bombardier CRJ900 NextGen]] at Copenhagen in 2011.]]\nIn September 2007, two separate incidents of similar landing gear failures occurred within four days of each other on SAS  Bombardier Q400 aircraft.

SAS aircraft look predominantly white, however, the fuselage is in a very light beige (Pantone Warm Gray 2/Pantone 9083C) with \"Scandinavian\" above the windows in silver lettering (Pantone 877) and \"Airlines\" below the windows in white. The typeface used is [[Rotis#Rotis Semi Serif|Rotis Semi Serif]]. The vertical stabiliser (and winglets) are painted blue (Pantone 2738C) with the classic white SAS logo on it. It is a variant of the traditional SAS logotype, slimmed slightly and stylised by the design company Stockholm Design Lab, as part of the SAS livery change. The engine casing is painted in scarlet (Pantone Warm Red/Pantone 179C) with the word Scandinavian in white, the [[thrust reversers]] in the colour of the fuselage. All other text is painted in Pantone Warm Gray 9. The design also features stylised versions of the Scandinavian flags. All aircraft are named, traditionally after Vikings.\n\nIn September 2019, SAS unveiled an all-new livery,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Scandinavian Way|url=https://www.flysas.com/en/newfleet/|website=www.flysas.com|publisher=Scandinavian Airlines System |accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref> which will initially be showcased on a new A350 and an A320neo, before gradually being rolled out to the whole fleet.\n\nApart from the standard livery, SAS also has an Airbus A319 in [[retrojet|retro livery]] and two Boeing 737s and one Airbus A340 in Star Alliance livery.\n\n==Cabin==\n[[File:SAS Carvelle SE-210 (19).jpg|thumb|A Scandinavian Airlines flight attendant serving passengers in the 1960s.]]\n\n===SAS Business===\nOn long-haul flights business class, called ''SAS Business'', is still offered and features wide sleeper seats. On the [[Airbus A330]]s and upgraded [[Airbus A340]]s seating is 1-2-1 on seats that convert into {{convert|196|\u2013|202|cm}} flat beds, with power sockets and a {{convert|15|in}} entertainment screen.\n\n===SAS Plus===\nPlus is SAS' premium economy class. On wide-body aircraft, seating has a 2-3-2 configuration. The seats offered on SAS Plus are wider than those in the SAS Go section.\n\nOn European flights, SAS Plus tickets are refundable and include a meal, a double checked-in baggage allowance, and access to lounges and fast track security at the airport. The SAS Plus passengers are seated at the front of the aircraft and passengers can choose their seat at booking for free, but the seats there are otherwise the same as the SAS Go seats. The two-class system was introduced in June 2013, when [[business class]] was eliminated from intra-European flights.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.traveldailymedia.com/192395/sas-revamps-cabin-classes/|title=SAS revamps cabin classes|last=Elliott|first=Mark|publisher=Travel Daily Media|accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===SAS Go===\nSAS Go, or economy offers 3-3 seating on intracontinental flights, and 2-4-2 on the A330s and A340s.\n\nSAS offers free coffee and tea to GO passengers on short-haul services, except very short flights like [[Bergen Airport, Flesland|Bergen]]-[[Stavanger Airport, Sola|Stavanger]] or [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport|Stockholm]]-[[Visby Airport|Visby]]. Meals are served to all passengers on long-haul flights.\n\n===SAS Go Light===\nSAS Go Light is a variant of SAS Go with no checked luggage included. Tickets are sold in the same booking class as SAS Go and are otherwise identical. As of December 14, 2017, SAS Go Light is available on both European and Long-haul flights. It is not available on flights within the Nordic countries. SAS Go Light is aimed at competing with [[low-cost carriers]] for those who travel with hand luggage only. Extra luggage allowance for [[EuroBonus]] Silver, Gold, and Diamond members does not apply on SAS Go Light tickets and is only valid for EuroBonus Pandion members.\n\n==Services==\n===Fingerprint biometric identification===\nIn 2006, SAS Sweden launched a new [[biometric]] system for use throughout Sweden. Each passenger's fingerprints are, for security purposes, matched to their respective checked baggage. The new technology will be phased in at all the airports served by SAS, although the use of the system is voluntary for passengers. The system has been introduced in Norway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sasgroup.net/en/fingerprint-recognition-to-be-introduced-at-arlanda-and-landvetter/|title=Fingerprint recognition to be introduced at Arlanda and Landvetter}}</ref>\n\n===EuroBonus===\n{{Main|EuroBonus}}\nSAS's frequent-flyer program is called EuroBonus. Members earn points on all SAS and Wider\u00f8e flights as well as on Star Alliance flights. The EuroBonus program has more than four million members.<ref>http://www.sasgroup.net/en/sas-celebrates-four-million-eurobonus-members/|accessdate={{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 09 May 2016</ref>\n\n===Fly Home Club===\n''Fly Home Club'' was SAS's membership club for Scandinavians living in Spain. It has closed ever since economic conditions have worsened in Spain and as Scandinavians living in Spain have decided to return home or change locations.\n\n===Hovercraft===\nBetween 1984 and 1994 SAS operated a [[hovercraft]] service between Malm\u00f6 in Sweden and [[Copenhagen Airport]] in Denmark. Travellers could check in for their flights in Malm\u00f6 and the hovercraft were operated as connecting flights. In 1994 the hovercraft were replaced by catamarans that operated until 2000 when the [[\u00d6resund bridge]] was opened and offered a rail link between Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen airport.<ref>[http://www.classicfastferries.com/cff/pdf/cff_2004_1.pdf SAS The Hovering Years] Classic Fast Ferries</ref>\n\n===Wi-Fi===\nIn May 2018, SAS launched a new high-speed WiFi system supplied by Viasat. The service is being rolled out on SAS short and medium-haul fleet and is expected to take two years to complete. The new system is much faster than previously available and will enable passengers to stream movies on board. Before this, SAS only offered WiFi on board on its long haul aircraft and a small number of Boeing 737s. WiFi is free for Eurobonus Gold and Diamond members as well as for those travelling in SAS Plus or Business. Otherwise, WiFi can be purchased with EuroBonus points or for a small fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sasgroup.net/en/sas-the-first-nordic-airline-to-launch-high-speed-wifi/|title=SAS the first Nordic airline to launch high speed WiFi - SAS|website=SAS|accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{{advert|date=February 2019}}\n* 2010:\n** Flightstats: Worlds Most Punctual Airline<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sasgroup.net/en/grand-slam-for-sas-at-grand-travel-awards/ |title=SAS nominated as both the world's and Europe's most punctual airline |publisher=sasgroup.net |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> \n** Simpliflying: Best Use of Social Media in a Crisis Situation<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/SAS/photos/a.281389815787.318771.140344030787/10150288373085788 SAS - Scandinavian Airlines on Facebook]. {{date|1-10-2010|dmy}}.

The [[Douglas DC-6|Douglas DC-6B]] flew from Copenhagen to Los Angeles with stops in S\u00f8ndre Str\u00f8mfjord (now [[Kangerlussuaq]]) in Greenland and Winnipeg in Canada. By summer 1956 frequency had increased to three flights per week. It was popular with Hollywood celebrities and film industry people, and the route turned out to be a publicity coup for SAS. Thanks to a [[tariff]] structure that allowed free transit to other European destinations via Copenhagen, this trans-polar route gained increasing popularity with American tourists throughout the 1950s. In 1957 SAS started a second polar route when a [[Douglas DC-7|Douglas DC-7C]] flew from Copenhagen to Tokyo via [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport|Anchorage International Airport]] in Alaska. The flight via Alaska was a compromise solution since the [[Soviet Union]] would not allow SAS, among other air carriers, to fly across [[Siberia]] between Europe and Japan, and Chinese airspace was also closed.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Jet era ===\n[[File:SAS Royal Hotel, Copenhagen, 1955-1960.jpg|thumb|Radisson Blu Royal Hotel in central [[Copenhagen]], originally SAS Royal Hotel, designed by [[Arne Jacobsen]] and built in 1960.]]\nSAS entered the jet age in 1959 when the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] entered service, with the [[Douglas DC-8]] then joining the fleet the next year.

Pictured: a [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-300ER]] at [[Kangerlussuaq Airport]] (2001).]]\n\n=== Acquisition of local airlines ===\nSAS gradually acquired control of the domestic markets in all three countries by acquiring full or partial control of local airlines, including [[Braathens]] and [[Wider\u00f8e]] in Norway; [[Linjeflyg]] and [[Skyways Express]] in Sweden; and [[Cimber Air]] in Denmark. In 1989, SAS acquired 18.4% of Texas Air Corporation, the parent company of [[Continental Airlines]], in a bid to form a global alliance. This stake was later sold. During the 1990s, SAS also bought a 20% stake in British Midland. SAS bought 95% of [[Spanair]], the second-largest airline in Spain, as well as [[Air Greenland]]. An agreement to divest more than 80 percent of the holdings in Spanair was signed with a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] group of investors led by Consorci de Turisme de Barcelona and Catalana d'Inciatives in January 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cisionwire.se/sas/avtal-om-forsaljning-av-spanair-har-ingatts|title=SAS \u2013 press release (in Swedish)|publisher=Cision Wire|accessdate=2009-01-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715074850/http://www.cisionwire.se/sas/avtal-om-forsaljning-av-spanair-har-ingatts|archivedate=15 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Star Alliance founding member ===\nIn May 1997, SAS formed the global [[Star Alliance]] network with [[Air Canada]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Thai Airways International]], and [[United Airlines]]. Four years earlier SAS unsuccessfully tried to merge with [[KLM]], Star Alliance partner [[Austrian Airlines]], and the now-defunct [[Swissair]], in a project called [[Alcazar (airline)|Alcazar]]. This failure led to the departure the following year of CEO [[Jan Carlzon]], who was credited for the financial turnaround of the company starting in 1981 and who envisioned SAS ownership of multiple airlines worldwide. The ownership structure of SAS was changed in June 2001, with a holding company being created in which the holdings of the governments changed to Sweden (21.4%), Norway (14.3%), and Denmark (14.3%) and the remaining 50% publicly held and traded on the stock market.\n\n=== Recent history (2004\u2013present) ===\nIn 2004 Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) was divided into four companies; SAS Scandinavian Airlines Sverige AB, SAS Scandinavian Airlines Danmark A/S, SAS Braathens AS, and SAS Scandinavian International AS. SAS Braathens was re-branded SAS Scandinavian Airlines Norge AS in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=147353|title=Press Release: SAS Braathens to be renamed SAS Norge|publisher=Waymaker (via SAS Group Press Release Archive)|accessdate=2010-03-23}}</ref> In October 2009 the four companies were once again united into one company, SAS Scandinavian System AB.\n\nWith the coming of low-cost airlines and decreasing fares in Scandinavia, the business turned into the red. To be profitable again, the airline had to cut costs. In a first step, the airline sold its stakes in other companies, such as [[British Midland International]], Spanair, and [[airBaltic]], and began to restructure its operations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/sas-sells-remaining-stake-in-bmi-to-lufthansa/|title=SAS Sells Remaining Stake in BMI to Lufthansa|last=Nicholson|first=Chris V. |date=1 October 2009|work=New York Times|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/30/spanair-idUSLU68460220090130|title=SAS sells Spanair for 1 euro, takes big charge|last=Roberts|first=Martin|date=30 January 2009|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=18 November 2012|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbaltic.com/public/company_history.html|title=Company history|work=airBaltic.com|publisher=airBaltic|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref> This was to save costs by about 23 percent between 2008 and 2011. In November 2012 the company came under heavy pressure from its owners and banks to implement even heavier cost-cutting measures as a condition for continued financial support. Negotiations with the respective [[trade union]]s took place for more than a week and exceeded the original deadline, but in the end, SAS and the trade unions reached an agreement that would increase the work time, cutting salary between 12-20%, pension, and retirement plans, and thus keep the airline flying. SAS drew some criticism for how it handled the negotiations, in denying facilities to the union delegations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.di.se/artiklar/2012/11/20/fackens-mardromsdygn-i-kopenhamn/|title= Nightmare for trade unions in Copenhagen |date=19 November 2012|work=Dagens Industri|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that SAS would form a new airline, [[Scandinavian Airlines Ireland]], operating out of [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]] and [[Malaga Airport]] to fly European routes on its parent's behalf using nine new A320Neo aircraft.\n\nAs part of an environmental initiative launched by [[San Francisco International Airport|SFO]], in December 2018 SAS flights operating out of SFO have been supplied with [[sustainable aviation fuel]] from [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and SkyNRG.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biofuels-news.com/display_news/14217/shell_starts_supplying_sustainable_fuel_at_californian_airport/|title=Shell starts supplying sustainable fuel at Californian airport {{!}} Biofuels International Magazine|website=Biofuels International|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.airport-world.com/news/general-news/6928-shell-supplies-sustainable-aviation-fuel-available-at-san-francisco-international-airport.html|title=Sustainable aviation fuel available at San Francisco International Airport - Airport World Magazine|last=Bates|first=Joe|website=www.airport-world.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref>\n\n==Corporate affairs==\n\n===Business trends===\nThe key trends for Scandinavian Airlines Group (which includes SAS Cargo, SAS Ground Handling, and SAS Tech), are shown below:\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!\n! 2008\n! 2009\n! 2010\n! 2011\n! 2012{{efn|In 2012 the company changed its financial year to 1 November\u201331 October, instead of the calendar year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=249963 |title=Resolutions approved by the 2012 Annual General Shareholders' Meeting of SAS AB |publisher=SAS Group |accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref>  The figures above are therefore for years ending 31 December until 2011, for the 10 months to 31 October 2012, and for years ending 31 October thereafter.}} <br><small>Jan\u2013Oct</small>\n! 2013\n! 2014\n! 2015\n! 2016\n! 2017\n! 2018\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Turnover ([[Swedish krona|SEK]]m)\n| 47,536\n| 39,696\n| 36,524\n| 36,735\n| 33,148\n| 42,182\n| 38,006\n| 39,650\n| 39,459\n| 42,654\n! scope=\"row\" | 44,718\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Profit before tax ([[Earnings before taxes|EBT]]) (SEKm)\n| {{color|red|&minus;188}}\n| {{color|red|&minus;1,522}}\n| {{color|red|&minus;33}}\n| 543\n| 228\n| 1,648\n| {{color|red|&minus;918}}\n| 1,417\n| 1,431\n| 1,725\n! scope=\"row\" | 2,041\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Number of employees (average [[Full-time equivalent|FTE]])\n| 16,286\n| 14,438\n| 13,723\n| 13,479\n| 13,591\n| 14,127\n| 12,329\n| 11,288\n| 10,710\n| 10,324\n! scope=\"row\" | 10,146\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Number of passengers (m)\n| 30.9\n| 27.0\n| 27.1\n| 29.0\n| 25.9\n| 30.4\n| 29.4\n| 28.1\n| 29.4\n| 30.1\n! scope=\"row\" | 30.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Passenger load factor (%)\n| 72.3\n| 72.7\n| 75.6\n| 74.9\n| 76.7\n| 75.0\n| 76.9\n| 76.3\n| 76.0\n| 76.8\n! scope=\"row\" | 75.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Total unit cost (CASK) (SEK)\n| 0.94\n| 1.01\n| 0.95\n| 0.86\n| 0.81\n| 0.80\n| 0.75\n| 0.79\n| 0.70\n| 0.69\n! scope=\"row\" | 0.72\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Total unit revenue (RASK) (SEK)\n| 0.91\n| 0.92\n| 0.86\n| 0.82\n| 0.82\n| 0.78\n| 0.70\n| 0.80\n| \n|\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Number of aircraft (at year end)\n| 181\n| 172\n| 159\n| 147\n| 145\n| 139\n| 138\n| 152\n| 156\n| 158\n! scope=\"row\" | 157\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | <small>''Figures for SAS Group.

The base in Oslo will then operate mostly Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with a few 737-700s also being retained.

The agreement consists of eight A350-900s with six options and four A330-300Es. The first new long haul aircraft to enter service will be the A330-300E, which were originally planned to replace the aging A340-300s in 2015 as leasing agreements on these aircraft expire. Instead, SAS renewed the leasing agreements to be able to expand its long-haul fleet and used the new A330-300Es to add more long-haul destinations to its network. The A350-900 is planned to enter service in November 2019. SAS has dubbed this \"a total renewal of long haul fleet\", indicating that all former A340 and A330 will be replaced, although the total renewal could also refer to the new interior in the long haul fleet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=269175 |title=SAS Group - Press |publisher=Se.yhp.waymaker.net |date=2013-06-25 |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref>\n\nThe first of 8 Airbus A350-900s for SAS is expected to be delivered to the airline before the end of 2019 and to start to operate long haul routes from 28 January 2020.<ref>{{cite journal |title=SAS Scandinavian Airlines |journal=Airliner World |volume=August 2019 |page=11}}</ref> The A350 will first fly on the [[Copenhagen Airport|Copenhagen]] and [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]] route, with the airline planning [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Beijing]], [[Newark Liberty International Airport|New York]], [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo]], [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong]] and [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]] when more A350 are delivered in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sasgroup.net/en/sas-announces-first-a350-flights-and-features/|accessdate=25 October 2019|title=SAS announces first A350 flights and features}}</ref>\n\n===Removal of SAS Q400 fleet===\n{{Main|Dash 8 landing gear incidents}}\n[[File:Sas oy-kfe cr9.jpg|thumb|A [[Bombardier CRJ700#CRJ900|Bombardier CRJ900 NextGen]] at Copenhagen in 2011.]]\nIn September 2007, two separate incidents of similar landing gear failures occurred within four days of each other on SAS  Bombardier Q400 aircraft. A third incident occurred in October 2007. On 28 October 2007, in a move that was described as unique by the Swedish press, the board of directors announced that all 27 [[Bombardier Q400]] aircraft were to be removed from service due to the three landing gear failures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=155746|title=SAS removes Dash 8 Q400 from service permanently|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102112035/http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=155746|archivedate=2 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA press release from SAS said that the company had reached a settlement with Bombardier and Goodrich, whereby the airline would receive [[Swedish krona|SEK]] one billion as compensation, while SAS would purchase 27 new aircraft, with an option of 24 more.

SAS aircraft look predominantly white, however, the fuselage is in a very light beige (Pantone Warm Gray 2/Pantone 9083C) with \"Scandinavian\" above the windows in silver lettering (Pantone 877) and \"Airlines\" below the windows in white. The typeface used is [[Rotis#Rotis Semi Serif|Rotis Semi Serif]]. The vertical stabiliser (and winglets) are painted blue (Pantone 2738C) with the classic white SAS logo on it. It is a variant of the traditional SAS logotype, slimmed slightly and stylised by the design company Stockholm Design Lab, as part of the SAS livery change. The engine casing is painted in scarlet (Pantone Warm Red/Pantone 179C) with the word Scandinavian in white, the [[thrust reversers]] in the colour of the fuselage. All other text is painted in Pantone Warm Gray 9. The design also features stylised versions of the Scandinavian flags. All aircraft are named, traditionally after Vikings.\n\nIn September 2019, SAS unveiled an all-new livery,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Scandinavian Way|url=https://www.flysas.com/en/newfleet/|website=www.flysas.com|publisher=Scandinavian Airlines System |accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref> which will initially be showcased on a new A350 and an A320neo, before gradually being rolled out to the whole fleet.\n\nApart from the standard livery, SAS also has an Airbus A319 in [[retrojet|retro livery]] and two Boeing 737s and one Airbus A340 in Star Alliance livery.\n\n==Cabin==\n[[File:SAS Carvelle SE-210 (19).jpg|thumb|A Scandinavian Airlines flight attendant serving passengers in the 1960s.]]\n\n===SAS Business===\nOn long-haul flights business class, called ''SAS Business'', is still offered and features wide sleeper seats. On the [[Airbus A330]]s and upgraded [[Airbus A340]]s seating is 1-2-1 on seats that convert into {{convert|196|\u2013|202|cm}} flat beds, with power sockets and a {{convert|15|in}} entertainment screen.\n\n===SAS Plus===\nPlus is SAS' premium economy class. On wide-body aircraft, seating has a 2-3-2 configuration. The seats offered on SAS Plus are wider than those in the SAS Go section.\n\nOn European flights, SAS Plus tickets are refundable and include a meal, a double checked-in baggage allowance, and access to lounges and fast track security at the airport. The SAS Plus passengers are seated at the front of the aircraft and passengers can choose their seat at booking for free, but the seats there are otherwise the same as the SAS Go seats. The two-class system was introduced in June 2013, when [[business class]] was eliminated from intra-European flights.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.traveldailymedia.com/192395/sas-revamps-cabin-classes/|title=SAS revamps cabin classes|last=Elliott|first=Mark|publisher=Travel Daily Media|accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===SAS Go===\nSAS Go, or economy offers 3-3 seating on intracontinental flights, and 2-4-2 on the A330s and A340s.\n\nSAS offers free coffee and tea to GO passengers on short-haul services, except very short flights like [[Bergen Airport, Flesland|Bergen]]-[[Stavanger Airport, Sola|Stavanger]] or [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport|Stockholm]]-[[Visby Airport|Visby]]. Meals are served to all passengers on long-haul flights.\n\n===SAS Go Light===\nSAS Go Light is a variant of SAS Go with no checked luggage included. Tickets are sold in the same booking class as SAS Go and are otherwise identical. As of December 14, 2017, SAS Go Light is available on both European and Long-haul flights. It is not available on flights within the Nordic countries. SAS Go Light is aimed at competing with [[low-cost carriers]] for those who travel with hand luggage only. Extra luggage allowance for [[EuroBonus]] Silver, Gold, and Diamond members does not apply on SAS Go Light tickets and is only valid for EuroBonus Pandion members.\n\n==Services==\n===Fingerprint biometric identification===\nIn 2006, SAS Sweden launched a new [[biometric]] system for use throughout Sweden. Each passenger's fingerprints are, for security purposes, matched to their respective checked baggage. The new technology will be phased in at all the airports served by SAS, although the use of the system is voluntary for passengers. The system has been introduced in Norway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sasgroup.net/en/fingerprint-recognition-to-be-introduced-at-arlanda-and-landvetter/|title=Fingerprint recognition to be introduced at Arlanda and Landvetter}}</ref>\n\n===EuroBonus===\n{{Main|EuroBonus}}\nSAS's frequent-flyer program is called EuroBonus. Members earn points on all SAS and Wider\u00f8e flights as well as on Star Alliance flights. The EuroBonus program has more than four million members.<ref>http://www.sasgroup.net/en/sas-celebrates-four-million-eurobonus-members/|accessdate={{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 09 May 2016</ref>\n\n===Fly Home Club===\n''Fly Home Club'' was SAS's membership club for Scandinavians living in Spain. It has closed ever since economic conditions have worsened in Spain and as Scandinavians living in Spain have decided to return home or change locations.\n\n===Hovercraft===\nBetween 1984 and 1994 SAS operated a [[hovercraft]] service between Malm\u00f6 in Sweden and [[Copenhagen Airport]] in Denmark. Travellers could check in for their flights in Malm\u00f6 and the hovercraft were operated as connecting flights. In 1994 the hovercraft were replaced by catamarans that operated until 2000 when the [[\u00d6resund bridge]] was opened and offered a rail link between Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen airport.<ref>[http://www.classicfastferries.com/cff/pdf/cff_2004_1.pdf SAS The Hovering Years] Classic Fast Ferries</ref>\n\n===Wi-Fi===\nIn May 2018, SAS launched a new high-speed WiFi system supplied by Viasat. The service is being rolled out on SAS short and medium-haul fleet and is expected to take two years to complete. The new system is much faster than previously available and will enable passengers to stream movies on board. Before this, SAS only offered WiFi on board on its long haul aircraft and a small number of Boeing 737s. WiFi is free for Eurobonus Gold and Diamond members as well as for those travelling in SAS Plus or Business. Otherwise, WiFi can be purchased with EuroBonus points or for a small fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sasgroup.net/en/sas-the-first-nordic-airline-to-launch-high-speed-wifi/|title=SAS the first Nordic airline to launch high speed WiFi - SAS|website=SAS|accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{{advert|date=February 2019}}\n* 2010:\n** Flightstats: Worlds Most Punctual Airline<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sasgroup.net/en/grand-slam-for-sas-at-grand-travel-awards/ |title=SAS nominated as both the world's and Europe's most punctual airline |publisher=sasgroup.net |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> \n** Simpliflying: Best Use of Social Media in a Crisis Situation<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/SAS/photos/a.281389815787.318771.140344030787/10150288373085788 SAS - Scandinavian Airlines on Facebook]. {{date|1-10-2010|dmy}}.
