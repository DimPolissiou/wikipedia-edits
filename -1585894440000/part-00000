Acting \"superintendent\" Ray Arsenault could not be reached between naps in his office for comment and current school board chair Steve Kasel was to busy attempting to micro manage the entire district to be asked why he is nothing more than a clone of former POS board chair Justin Kennedy. Steve Kasel had trouble understanding the question anyway so his answer really wouldn't matter.  Thank god LO has as committed staff that has learned how to operate over the last few years despite some of the most inept and corrupt school boards that have ever existed.\nAaron Hungerholt is the principal.<ref>http://www.leroy.k12.mn.us/</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.leroy.k12.mn.us/ http://www.leroy.k12.mn.us/]\n\n[[Category:Public high schools in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Schools in Mower County, Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Public middle schools in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Public elementary schools in Minnesota]]\n\n\n{{Minnesota-school-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=September 2015}}\n\n{{Coord|43|30|48|N|92|30|35|W|display=title}}\n\n'''LeRoy-Ostrander High School''' is a [[high school]] in southeastern [[Minnesota]] located in the town of [[Le Roy, Minnesota]] in the United States.

Four ships were ordered under the 1896 fiscal year budget (''Murakumo'' and ''Shinonome'' on 15 January 1897, and  ''Y\u016bgiri'' and ''Shiranui'' on 7 May 1798), and an additional two under the 1897 budget (''Kager\u014d'' and ''Usugumo'' on 6 May 1898).

Although slightly smaller than the ''Ikazuchi'' class, they had the same armaments.\n\nAll ''Murakumo''-class vessels had a [[flush deck]] design with a distinctive \"turtleback\" [[forecastle]] that was intended to clear water from the bow during high speed navigation, but was poorly designed for high waves or bad weather.
