The 990 was lengthened by {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}, which increased the number of passengers from between 88 and 110 in the 880 to between 96 and 121 in the 990. This was still fewer passengers than the contemporary [[Boeing 707]] (110 to 189) or [[Douglas DC-8]] (105 to 173), although the 990 was {{convert|25|-|35|mph|kph|abbr=on}} faster than either in cruise.\n\n==Design and development==\nAmerican Airlines asked Convair to design an aircraft for coast-to-coast flights, able to fly nonstop from [[New York City]] to [[Los Angeles]] against the wind. They wanted a somewhat larger passenger capacity than the 880, which was the smallest of the first-generation U.S. jet airliners. The 990 began flight testing January 24, 1961.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Proctor|first1=Jon|title=Convair 880 & 990|date=June 1996|publisher=World Transport Press|location=Miami|isbn=0-9626730-4-8|page=55|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nOne change from the 880 was the large [[anti-shock bodies]] on the upper [[trailing edge]] of the wings to increase the critical Mach and reduce transonic drag. The inboard shock bodies, which were larger, were also used for additional fuel tankage. Later during the design period, Convair modified the design to include fuel in the outboard pods as well, but during the initial test flights the extra weight caused the outboard engines to oscillate in certain conditions. The pods were redesigned once more, and shortened by {{convert|28|inch}}, causing increased drag.

Their fleet was withdrawn from service in 1975. [[Scandinavian Airlines]] also operated Coronados on their long-haul schedules to Tokyo and other destinations in the Far East.\n\nThe 990's niche was soon captured by the [[Boeing 720]] and [[Boeing 720B]], derivatives of the [[Boeing 707]], and later by the [[Boeing 727]]. By the time the assembly line shut down in 1963, only 37 990s had been produced, bringing General Dynamics' entire production of commercial jet airliners to 102 airframes. The failure of airlines to broadly accept the Convair 880 and 990 led Convair's parent company, General Dynamics, to suffer what at the time was one of the largest corporate losses in history. As a result, Convair exited the jet airliner business, although they later profitably built fuselages for the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], [[KC-10]] and [[MD-11]].\n\nWhen the major airlines retired their Convair 990s, they found a second life on charter airlines. [[Spantax]] of Spain had a large fleet until the mid-1980s and so did [[Denver Ports of Call]].

The 990 was lengthened by {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}, which increased the number of passengers from between 88 and 110 in the 880 to between 96 and 121 in the 990.

They wanted a somewhat larger passenger capacity than the 880, which was the smallest of the first-generation U.S. jet airliners.

The inboard shock bodies, which were larger, were also used for additional fuel tankage. Later during the design period, Convair modified the design to include fuel in the outboard pods as well, but during the initial test flights the extra weight caused the outboard engines to oscillate in certain conditions.

Their fleet was withdrawn from service in 1975. [[Scandinavian Airlines]] also operated Coronados on their long-haul schedules to Tokyo and other destinations in the Far East.\n\nThe 990's niche was soon captured by the [[Boeing 720]] and [[Boeing 720B]], derivatives of the [[Boeing 707]], and later by the [[Boeing 727]]. By the time the assembly line shut down in 1963, only 37 990s had been produced, bringing General Dynamics' entire production of commercial jet airliners to 102 airframes. The failure of airlines to broadly accept the Convair 880 and 990 led Convair's parent company, General Dynamics, to suffer what at the time was one of the largest corporate losses in history. As a result, Convair exited the jet airliner business, although they later profitably built fuselages for the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], [[KC-10]] and [[MD-11]].\n\nWhen the major airlines retired their Convair 990s, they found a second life on charter airlines. [[Spantax]] of Spain had a large fleet until the mid-1980s and so did [[Denver Ports of Call]]. In 1967, [[Alaska Airlines]] purchased Convair 990 PP-VJE from [[Varig]], and operated it as N987AS in scheduled airline service until 1975.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Variants==\n* '''990''' : Initial production version.\n* '''990A''' : Higher cruising speed and longer range.<ref>[http://www.airliners.net/aviation-articles/read.main?id=67# \"The Might-Have-Beens: Convair 880 and 990.\"]{{Dead link|date=February 2020}} ''Airliners.net.''

{"title_page": "Feminism in the United Kingdom", "text_new": "{{Feminism sidebar}}\nAs in other countries, '''feminism in the United Kingdom''' seeks to establish political, social, and economic equality for women. The history of feminism in Britain dates to the very beginnings of [[feminism]] itself, as many of the earliest feminist writers and activists\u2014such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Barbara Bodichon]], and [[Lydia Becker]]\u2014were British.\n\n==19th century==\n{{main|History of women in the United Kingdom#19th century}}\n[[File:+Ann Thornton Going Aloft.jpg|thumb|160px|''[[Anne Jane Thornton|Ann Thornton]] Going Aloft'', ''c.'' 1835]]\nThe advent of the [[Reformism|reformist]] age during the 19th century meant that those invisible minorities or marginalised majorities were to find a catalyst and a microcosm in such new tendencies of reform. [[Robert Owen]], while asking for \"social reorganisation\", was laying down the basis of a new reformational background. One of those movements that took advantage of such new spirit was the [[feminist movement]]. The stereotype of the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] gentle lady became unacceptable and even intolerable. The first organised movement for British women's suffrage was the [[Langham Place Circle]] of the 1850s, led by [[Barbara Bodichon]] (''n\u00e9e'' Leigh-Smith) and [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]]. They also campaigned for improved female rights in the law, employment, education, and marriage.\n\nProperty owning women and widows had been allowed to vote in some local elections, but that ended in 1835. The [[Chartist Movement]] of 1838 to 1857 was a large-scale demand for suffrage\u2014however it only gave suffrage to men over 21. In 1851 the [[Sheffield Female Political Association]] was founded and submitted an unsuccessful petition calling for women's suffrage to the House of Lords. This probably inspired British feminist [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] to write the pro-women's-suffrage ''[[The Enfranchisement of Women]]'' (1851).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/taylor_harriet.shtml|title=BBC - History - Historic Figures: Harriet Taylor (1807 - 1858)}}</ref><ref name=\"Harriet Taylor Mill 1807 - 1858\">[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html Harriet Taylor Mill (1807 - 1858)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070414184944/http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html |date=2007-04-14 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/awrm/doc15.htm|title=Harriet Taylor Mill, Enfranchisement of Women, 1851|website=womhist.alexanderstreet.com}}</ref> On June 7, 1866 a petition from 1,499 women calling for women's suffrage was presented to the Parliament, but it also did not succeed.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsehistory/2016/06/07/the-1866-womens-suffrage-petition/ |title=The 1866 women's suffrage petition &#124; LSE History |publisher=Blogs.lse.ac.uk |date=2016-06-12 |accessdate=2018-02-07}}</ref>\n\nUpper-class women could exert a little backstage political influence in high society. However, in divorce cases, rich women lost control of their children.\n\n===Careers===\nAmbitious middle-class women faced enormous challenges when they proposed entering suitable careers, such as nursing, teaching, law, and medicine, and the loftier their ambition, the greater the challenge. Physicians barred admission to the medical profession; there were a few opportunities for women lawyers, but none as clerics.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_500_506\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 500\u2013506 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref> White collar business opportunities outside family-owned shops were few until clerical positions opened in the 20th century.  [[Florence Nightingale]] demonstrated the necessity of professional nursing and warfare, and set up an educational system that tracked women into that field in the second half of the nineteenth century.  Teaching was not quite as easy to break into, but the low salaries were less of the barrier to the single woman than to the married man.  By the late 1860s a number of schools were preparing women for careers as governesses or teachers. The census reported in 1851 that 70,000 women in England and Wales were teachers, compared to the 170,000 who comprised three-fourths of all teachers in 1901.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_500\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | page = 500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Copelman | first = Dina | title = London's women teachers: gender, class and feminism, 1870-1930 | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780415867528 }}</ref> The great majority came from lower middle class origins.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Coppock | first = David A. | title = Respectability as a prerequisite of moral character: the social and occupational mobility of pupil teachers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries | journal = [[History of Education Quarterly|History of Education]] | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 165\u2013186 | doi = 10.1080/0046760970260203 | date = 1997 | ref = harv }}</ref> The National Union of Women Teachers (NUWT) originated in the early 20th century inside the male-controlled National Union of Teachers (NUT).

One route to entry was to go to the United States where there were suitable schools for women as early as 1850.  Britain was the last major country to train women physicians, so 80 to 90% of the British women came to America for their medical degrees.  Edinburgh University admitted a few women in 1869, then reversed itself in 1873, leaving a strong negative reaction among British medical educators.  The first separate school for women physicians opened in London in 1874 to a handful of students. Scotland was more open.

It required a very expensive private act of Parliament costing perhaps \u00a3200, of the sort only the richest could possibly afford. It was very difficult to secure divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, or cruelty.  The first key legislative victory came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857|Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857]]. It passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England. The new law made divorce a civil affair of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases.  The process was still quite expensive, at about \u00a340, but now became feasible for the middle class. A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a ''feme sole,'' with full control of her own civil rights.  Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace. The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]].<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Stone | editor-first = Lawrence | title = Road to divorce: England 1530-1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780198226512 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref>\n\n===Prostitution===\n{{main|Prostitution in the United Kingdom}}\nBullough argues that prostitution in 18th-century Britain was a convenience to men of all social statuses, and economic necessity for many poor women, and was tolerated by society.

Parliament in the 1860s in the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] (\"CD\") adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The \"regulationist policy\" was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching venereal disease. Young women officially became prostitutes and were  trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by [[Josephine Butler]] and the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]], Parliament repealed the acts in 1886 and ended legalised prostitution. Butler became a sort of saviour to the girls she helped free. The age of consent for young women was raised from 12 to 16, undercutting the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand. The new moral code meant that respectable men dared not be caught.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_498\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 498\u2013500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Strachey | first1 = Ray | last2 = Strachey | first2 = Barbara | title = The cause: a short history of the women's movement in Great Britain | pages = 187\u2013222 | publisher = Virago | location = London | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780860680420 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Bartley | first = Paula | title = Prostitution: prevention and reform in England, 1860-1914 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780415214575 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Smith | first = F.B. | title = The Contagious Diseases Acts reconsidered | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 197\u2013215 | doi = 10.1093/shm/3.2.197 | pmid = 11622578 | date = August 1990 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n===Protection for rich and poor women===\nA series of four laws each called the [[Married Women's Property Act (disambiguation)|Married Women's Property Act]] passed Parliament from [[Married Women's Property Act 1870|1870]] to [[Married Women's Property Act 1893|1893]] that effectively removed the restrictions that kept wealthy married women from controlling their own property.

[[Emily Davison]], a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 [[Epsom Derby]] and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} As many protesters were imprisoned and [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|went on hunger-strike]], the Liberal government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.  Historians generally argue that the first stage of the militant suffragette movement under the Pankhursts in 1906 had a dramatic mobilizing effect on the suffrage movement.  Women were thrilled and supportive of revolting in the streets; the membership of the militant WSPU and the older NUWSS overlapped and was mutually supportive.  However a system of publicity, Ensor argues, had to continue to escalate to maintain its high visibility in the media.  The hunger strikes and force-feeding did that.  However the Pankhursts refused any advice and escalated their tactics. They turned to systematic disruption of Liberal Party meetings as well as physical violence in terms of damaging public buildings and arson.  This went too far, as the overwhelming majority of suffragists pulled back and refused to follow because they could no longer defend the tactics.  Shey increasingly repudiated the suffragettes as an obstacle to achieving suffrage, saying the militant suffragettes  were now aiding the antis, and many historians agree.  Searle says the methods of the suffragettes did succeed in damaging the Liberal party but failed to advance the cause of woman suffrage.  When the Pankhursts decided to stop the militancy at the start of the war, and enthusiastically support the war effort, the movement split and their leadership role ended.  Suffrage did come four years later, but the feminist movement in Britain permanently abandoned the militant tactics that had made the suffragettes famous.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ensor | first = Robert C.K. | title = England: 1870-1914 | pages = 389\u2013399 | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | oclc = 24731395 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Searle | first = G.

Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganising effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = Martin D. | title = Politicians and the woman's vote 1914\u20131918 | journal = [[History (journal)|History]] | volume = 59 | issue = 197 | pages = 358\u2013374 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02222.x | jstor = 24409414 | date = October 1974 | ref = harv }}</ref> More generally, Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers.

As a political lobby group it aimed at political, occupational, moral, social, economic and legal equality. Thus it was ideologically allied with the Open Door Council, rather than National Council. It also lobbied at an international level, such as the [[League of Nations]], and continued its work till 1983. In retrospect both ideological groups were influential in advancing women's rights in their own way. Despite women being admitted to the House of Commons from 1918, Mackworth, a Viscountess in her own right, spent a lifetime fighting to take her seat in the House of Lords against bitter opposition, a battle which only achieved its goal in the year of her death (1958). This revealed the weaknesses of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act. Mackworth also founded [[Time and Tide (magazine)|''Time and Tide'']] which became the group's journal, and to which West, Virginia Woolf, [[Rose Macaulay]] and many others contributed. A number of other women's periodicals also appeared in the 1920s, including ''Woman and Home'', and ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', but whose content reflect very different aspirations. In 1925 Rebecca West wrote in ''Time and Tide'' something that reflected not only the movement's need to redefine itself post suffrage, but a continual need for re-examination of goals. \"When those of our army whose voices are inclined to coolly tell us that the day of sex-antagonism is over and henceforth we have only to advance hand in hand with the male, I do not believe it.\"<ref>Walters, Margaret (2005). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=PCwdyaLCbXoC&pg=PT116 Early 20th-century feminism]\".

countries, '''feminism in the United Kingdom''' seeks to establish political, social, and economic equality for women. The history of feminism in Britain dates to the very beginnings of [[feminism]] itself, as many of the earliest feminist writers and activists\u2014such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Barbara Bodichon]], and [[Lydia Becker]]\u2014were British.\n\n==19th century==\n{{main|History of women in the United Kingdom#19th century}}\n[[File:+Ann Thornton Going Aloft.jpg|thumb|160px|''[[Anne Jane Thornton|Ann Thornton]] Going Aloft'', ''c.'' 1835]]\nThe advent of the [[Reformism|reformist]] age during the 19th century meant that those invisible minorities or marginalised majorities were to find a catalyst and a microcosm in such new tendencies of reform. [[Robert Owen]], while asking for \"social reorganisation\", was laying down the basis of a new reformational background. One of those movements that took advantage of such new spirit was the [[feminist movement]]. The stereotype of the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] gentle lady became unacceptable and even intolerable. The first organised movement for British women's suffrage was the [[Langham Place Circle]] of the 1850s, led by [[Barbara Bodichon]] (''n\u00e9e'' Leigh-Smith) and [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]]. They also campaigned for improved female rights in the law, employment, education, and marriage.\n\nProperty owning women and widows had been allowed to vote in some local elections, but that ended in 1835. The [[Chartist Movement]] of 1838 to 1857 was a large-scale demand for suffrage\u2014however it only gave suffrage to men over 21. In 1851 the [[Sheffield Female Political Association]] was founded and submitted an unsuccessful petition calling for women's suffrage to the House of Lords. This probably inspired British feminist [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] to write the pro-women's-suffrage ''[[The Enfranchisement of Women]]'' (1851).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/taylor_harriet.shtml|title=BBC - History - Historic Figures: Harriet Taylor (1807 - 1858)}}</ref><ref name=\"Harriet Taylor Mill 1807 - 1858\">[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html Harriet Taylor Mill (1807 - 1858)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070414184944/http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html |date=2007-04-14 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/awrm/doc15.htm|title=Harriet Taylor Mill, Enfranchisement of Women, 1851|website=womhist.alexanderstreet.com}}</ref> On June 7, 1866 a petition from 1,499 women calling for women's suffrage was presented to the Parliament, but it also did not succeed.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsehistory/2016/06/07/the-1866-womens-suffrage-petition/ |title=The 1866 women's suffrage petition &#124; LSE History |publisher=Blogs.lse.ac.uk |date=2016-06-12 |accessdate=2018-02-07}}</ref>\n\nUpper-class women could exert a little backstage political influence in high society. However, in divorce cases, rich women lost control of their children.\n\n===Careers===\nAmbitious middle-class women faced enormous challenges when they proposed entering suitable careers, such as nursing, teaching, law, and medicine, and the loftier their ambition, the greater the challenge. Physicians barred admission to the medical profession; there were a few opportunities for women lawyers, but none as clerics.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_500_506\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 500\u2013506 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref> White collar business opportunities outside family-owned shops were few until clerical positions opened in the 20th century.  [[Florence Nightingale]] demonstrated the necessity of professional nursing and warfare, and set up an educational system that tracked women into that field in the second half of the nineteenth century.  Teaching was not quite as easy to break into, but the low salaries were less of the barrier to the single woman than to the married man.  By the late 1860s a number of schools were preparing women for careers as governesses or teachers. The census reported in 1851 that 70,000 women in England and Wales were teachers, compared to the 170,000 who comprised three-fourths of all teachers in 1901.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_500\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | page = 500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Copelman | first = Dina | title = London's women teachers: gender, class and feminism, 1870-1930 | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780415867528 }}</ref> The great majority came from lower middle class origins.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Coppock | first = David A. | title = Respectability as a prerequisite of moral character: the social and occupational mobility of pupil teachers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries | journal = [[History of Education Quarterly|History of Education]] | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 165\u2013186 | doi = 10.1080/0046760970260203 | date = 1997 | ref = harv }}</ref> The National Union of Women Teachers (NUWT) originated in the early 20th century inside the male-controlled National Union of Teachers (NUT).

One route to entry was to go to the United States where there were suitable schools for women as early as 1850.  Britain was the last major country to train women physicians, so 80 to 90% of the British women came to America for their medical degrees.  Edinburgh University admitted a few women in 1869, then reversed itself in 1873, leaving a strong negative reaction among British medical educators.  The first separate school for women physicians opened in London in 1874 to a handful of students. Scotland was more open.

It required a very expensive private act of Parliament costing perhaps \u00a3200, of the sort only the richest could possibly afford. It was very difficult to secure divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, or cruelty.  The first key legislative victory came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857|Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857]]. It passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England. The new law made divorce a civil affair of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases.  The process was still quite expensive, at about \u00a340, but now became feasible for the middle class. A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a ''feme sole,'' with full control of her own civil rights.  Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace. The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]].<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Stone | editor-first = Lawrence | title = Road to divorce: England 1530-1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780198226512 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref>\n\n===Prostitution===\n{{main|Prostitution in the United Kingdom}}\nBullough argues that prostitution in 18th-century Britain was a convenience to men of all social statuses, and economic necessity for many poor women, and was tolerated by society.

Parliament in the 1860s in the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] (\"CD\") adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The \"regulationist policy\" was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching venereal disease. Young women officially became prostitutes and were  trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by [[Josephine Butler]] and the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]], Parliament repealed the acts in 1886 and ended legalised prostitution. Butler became a sort of saviour to the girls she helped free. The age of consent for young women was raised from 12 to 16, undercutting the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand. The new moral code meant that respectable men dared not be caught.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_498\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 498\u2013500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Strachey | first1 = Ray | last2 = Strachey | first2 = Barbara | title = The cause: a short history of the women's movement in Great Britain | pages = 187\u2013222 | publisher = Virago | location = London | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780860680420 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Bartley | first = Paula | title = Prostitution: prevention and reform in England, 1860-1914 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780415214575 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Smith | first = F.B. | title = The Contagious Diseases Acts reconsidered | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 197\u2013215 | doi = 10.1093/shm/3.2.197 | pmid = 11622578 | date = August 1990 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n===Protection for rich and poor women===\nA series of four laws each called the [[Married Women's Property Act (disambiguation)|Married Women's Property Act]] passed Parliament from [[Married Women's Property Act 1870|1870]] to [[Married Women's Property Act 1893|1893]] that effectively removed the restrictions that kept wealthy married women from controlling their own property.

[[Emily Davison]], a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 [[Epsom Derby]] and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} As many protesters were imprisoned and [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|went on hunger-strike]], the Liberal government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.  Historians generally argue that the first stage of the militant suffragette movement under the Pankhursts in 1906 had a dramatic mobilizing effect on the suffrage movement.  Women were thrilled and supportive of revolting in the streets; the membership of the militant WSPU and the older NUWSS overlapped and was mutually supportive.  However a system of publicity, Ensor argues, had to continue to escalate to maintain its high visibility in the media.  The hunger strikes and force-feeding did that.  However the Pankhursts refused any advice and escalated their tactics. They turned to systematic disruption of Liberal Party meetings as well as physical violence in terms of damaging public buildings and arson.  This went too far, as the overwhelming majority of suffragists pulled back and refused to follow because they could no longer defend the tactics.  Shey increasingly repudiated the suffragettes as an obstacle to achieving suffrage, saying the militant suffragettes  were now aiding the antis, and many historians agree.  Searle says the methods of the suffragettes did succeed in damaging the Liberal party but failed to advance the cause of woman suffrage.  When the Pankhursts decided to stop the militancy at the start of the war, and enthusiastically support the war effort, the movement split and their leadership role ended.  Suffrage did come four years later, but the feminist movement in Britain permanently abandoned the militant tactics that had made the suffragettes famous.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ensor | first = Robert C.K. | title = England: 1870-1914 | pages = 389\u2013399 | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | oclc = 24731395 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Searle | first = G.

Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganising effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = Martin D. | title = Politicians and the woman's vote 1914\u20131918 | journal = [[History (journal)|History]] | volume = 59 | issue = 197 | pages = 358\u2013374 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02222.x | jstor = 24409414 | date = October 1974 | ref = harv }}</ref> More generally, Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers.

As a political lobby group it aimed at political, occupational, moral, social, economic and legal equality. Thus it was ideologically allied with the Open Door Council, rather than National Council. It also lobbied at an international level, such as the [[League of Nations]], and continued its work till 1983. In retrospect both ideological groups were influential in advancing women's rights in their own way. Despite women being admitted to the House of Commons from 1918, Mackworth, a Viscountess in her own right, spent a lifetime fighting to take her seat in the House of Lords against bitter opposition, a battle which only achieved its goal in the year of her death (1958). This revealed the weaknesses of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act. Mackworth also founded [[Time and Tide (magazine)|''Time and Tide'']] which became the group's journal, and to which West, Virginia Woolf, [[Rose Macaulay]] and many others contributed. A number of other women's periodicals also appeared in the 1920s, including ''Woman and Home'', and ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', but whose content reflect very different aspirations. In 1925 Rebecca West wrote in ''Time and Tide'' something that reflected not only the movement's need to redefine itself post suffrage, but a continual need for re-examination of goals. \"When those of our army whose voices are inclined to coolly tell us that the day of sex-antagonism is over and henceforth we have only to advance hand in hand with the male, I do not believe it.\"<ref>Walters, Margaret (2005). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=PCwdyaLCbXoC&pg=PT116 Early 20th-century feminism]\".

The school moved several times during its first century to different locations in downtown Portland. It was located at 13th and Hall Streets before moving to its present location in the [[Raleigh Hills, Oregon|Raleigh Hills neighborhood of Portland]] in 1964. The Bishop Dagwell Hall was soon added, expanding the academic program to boys.\n\nIn 1972, St. Helen's Hall merged with Bishop Dagwell Hall to become Oregon Episcopal School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oes.edu/about/history.htm |accessdate=November 25, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018075208/http://www.oes.edu/about/history.htm |archivedate=October 18, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.oes.edu/page.cfm?p=676|title = A Brief History of OES|accessdate = 2015-02-09|website = Oregon Episcopal School|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150210202237/http://www.oes.edu/page.cfm?p=676|archive-date = 2015-02-10|url-status = dead}}</ref> Currently, the school serves children from prekindergarten through 12th grade and includes day-school and boarding programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oes.edu/about/fastfacts.htm |accessdate=November 25, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605163532/http://www.oes.edu/about/fastfacts.htm |archivedate=June 5, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nA number of facilities have been added over the years.

The school moved several times during its first century to different locations in downtown Portland. It was located at 13th and Hall Streets before moving to its present location in the [[Raleigh Hills, Oregon|Raleigh Hills neighborhood of Portland]] in 1964.

Open to horses age three and older, it is now run at the {{frac|1|1|4}} mile distance on dirt for a $700,000 purse.\n\nIn 2009, this race was downgraded from a [[Graded stakes race|Grade I]] to a Grade II event.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120712022542/http://news.bloodhorse.com/article/48193.htm Six New Grade I Races for 2009 - bloodhorse.com]</ref>\n\nThe Suburban Handicap was contested at a distance of one and one half miles in 1975 and at a mile and three-sixteenths in 1976. Beginning in 1978, the race was started on Belmont Park's clubhouse turn and run at a mile and a quarter.\n\nNamed after the City and Suburban Handicap in [[England]], the Suburban had its 133rd running in 2019. First held at [[Leonard Jerome|Leonard Jerome's]] [[Sheepshead Bay Race Track]] in 1884, it stayed at that location until 1913. For 1915 alone, the Suburban was held at [[Yonkers Raceway|Empire City Race Track]]; afterward, it was moved to Belmont Park and there it has remained except for the races of 1961 to 1974 and 1976.  During that time, the Suburban was hosted at [[Aqueduct Racetrack]].  The race was not run for three years: 1911, 1912, and 1914.\n\nThe Suburban is the final of the three races that once composed the [[New York Handicap Triple]] series of races, as it follows the [[Metropolitan Handicap]] and the [[Brooklyn Handicap]]. Four horses have won the Handicap Triple:\n* [[Whisk Broom II]] (1913)\n* [[Tom Fool]] (1953)\n* [[Kelso (horse)|Kelso]] (1961)\n* [[Fit to Fight]] (1984)\n\nThe list of former winners is like a who's who of the race horse world, featuring some of [[United States|American]] racing's greatest champions. The first mare to win the Suburban Handicap was the great [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]], [[Imp (horse)|Imp]].\n\n==Records==\n'''Speed record:'''\n* 1:58.33 - [[In Excess (horse)|In Excess]] (1991)\n* 1:46.58 - [[Mucho Macho Man]] (2012) (At distance of {{frac|1|1|8}} mile)\n\n'''Most wins:'''\n\n* 2 - [[Crusader (horse)|Crusader]] (1926, 1927)\n* 2 - [[Kelso (horse)|Kelso]] (1961, 1963)\n* 2 - [[Winter's Tale (horse)|Winter's Tale]] (1980, 1983)\n* 2 - [[Devil His Due]] (1993, 1994)\n* 2 - [[Flat Out (horse)|Flat Out]] (2010, 2013)\n* 2 - [[Effinex]] (2015, 2016)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[jockey]]:'''\n* 8 - [[Eddie Arcaro]] (1945, 1947, 1949, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1960, 1961)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[Horse trainer|trainer]]:'''\n* 5 - [[Sam Hildreth]] (1909, 1915, 1916, 1923, 1924)\n* 5 - [[James E.

Open to horses age three and older, it is now run at the {{frac|1|1|4}} mile distance on dirt for a $700,000 purse.\n\nIn 2009, this race was downgraded from a [[Graded stakes race|Grade I]] to a Grade II event.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120712022542/http://news.bloodhorse.com/article/48193.htm Six New Grade I Races for 2009 - bloodhorse.com]</ref>\n\nThe Suburban Handicap was contested at a distance of one and one half miles in 1975 and at a mile and three-sixteenths in 1976. Beginning in 1978, the race was started on Belmont Park's clubhouse turn and run at a mile and a quarter.\n\nNamed after the City and Suburban Handicap in [[England]], the Suburban had its 133rd running in 2019. First held at [[Leonard Jerome|Leonard Jerome's]] [[Sheepshead Bay Race Track]] in 1884, it stayed at that location until 1913. For 1915 alone, the Suburban was held at [[Yonkers Raceway|Empire City Race Track]]; afterward, it was moved to Belmont Park and there it has remained except for the races of 1961 to 1974 and 1976.  During that time, the Suburban was hosted at [[Aqueduct Racetrack]].  The race was not run for three years: 1911, 1912, and 1914.\n\nThe Suburban is the final of the three races that once composed the [[New York Handicap Triple]] series of races, as it follows the [[Metropolitan Handicap]] and the [[Brooklyn Handicap]]. Four horses have won the Handicap Triple:\n* [[Whisk Broom II]] (1913)\n* [[Tom Fool]] (1953)\n* [[Kelso (horse)|Kelso]] (1961)\n* [[Fit to Fight]] (1984)\n\nThe list of former winners is like a who's who of the race horse world, featuring some of [[United States|American]] racing's greatest champions. The first mare to win the Suburban Handicap was the great [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]], [[Imp (horse)|Imp]].\n\n==Records==\n'''Speed record:'''\n* 1:58.33 - [[In Excess (horse)|In Excess]] (1991)\n* 1:46.58 - [[Mucho Macho Man]] (2012) (At distance of {{frac|1|1|8}} mile)\n\n'''Most wins:'''\n\n* 2 - [[Crusader (horse)|Crusader]] (1926, 1927)\n* 2 - [[Kelso (horse)|Kelso]] (1961, 1963)\n* 2 - [[Winter's Tale (horse)|Winter's Tale]] (1980, 1983)\n* 2 - [[Devil His Due]] (1993, 1994)\n* 2 - [[Flat Out (horse)|Flat Out]] (2010, 2013)\n* 2 - [[Effinex]] (2015, 2016)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[jockey]]:'''\n* 8 - [[Eddie Arcaro]] (1945, 1947, 1949, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1960, 1961)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[Horse trainer|trainer]]:'''\n* 5 - [[Sam Hildreth]] (1909, 1915, 1916, 1923, 1924)\n* 5 - [[James E.
