While all speedruns aim for quick completion, some speedruns are characterized by additional goals or limitations that players subject themselves to, such as collecting all key items or playing blindfolded. Players speedrun mainly to challenge themselves, to entertain and to compete with themselves and others. Players performing speedruns, called speedrunners, often record their attempts. These recordings are used to entertain others, to verify the completion time, to certify that all rules were followed, and to spot ways to further improve the completion time.{{refn|group=Note|name=DemoFormat|Although many speedruns are released as video recordings, which are often preferred due to being more universal,  some communities use a game's native demo recordings (such as the <tt>DEM</tt> format in by ''Quake'') since these are much more compact and easier to share with others. Such recordings require specific software to view, usually a version of the original game. Some communities release speedruns in both formats so that they become accessible to a larger audience.}}\n\nTo achieve a high level of play, speedrunners often have to reason about the game differently from the way that ordinary players might. Speedruns usually follow [[gameplay]] routes that are planned out carefully before they are attempted. Many games have opportunities to disarrange the intended sequence of events and skip entire parts of it \u2014 often called [[sequence breaking]] \u2014 and many more have programming mistakes, or [[glitch]]es, that a skillful player can exploit to their advantage. [[Tool-assisted speedrun]]ning is a type of speedrunning in which various computer tools are used to obtain performances which would be near-impossible for a human player, and are not held in competition with speedruns done by human players in real time, known as real-time speedruns.\n\nSome games are considered to be particularly suited to speedrunning and have [[virtual community|online communities]] dedicated to them, which can provide an active platform for discussing, publishing, and improving speedruns. Speedruns can be viewed on a variety of platforms, including [[Streaming media|live streams]] where players can carry out and share their attempts in real-time. Although speedrunning was originally not a widespread phenomenon, it has since grown to involve several active websites and an increasingly expansive assortment of speedrun videos that are freely and widely circulated on the Internet.\n\n== Glitches and sequence breaking ==\n{{main|Glitch|Sequence breaking}}\nWhile routing, it becomes apparent that some of the goals in the game do not need to be achieved for completion. Such elements include [[cutscene]]s that need to be watched before the player can progress, items that the player needs to possess in order to continue to a next stage or even entire parts of the gameplay that may convey a part of the game's plot or a subplot. Skipping a part of the game in such a fashion that it can be described as disjointed with the game's intended/common sequence of events is referred to as ''sequence breaking''.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/sekiro-speedrunners-discover-wild-techniques-to-beat-th-1833720570|title=Sekiro Speedrunners Discover Wild Techniques To Beat The Game In 40 Minutes|last=Degraffinried|first=Natalie|date=2019-04-01|website=Kotaku|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531090636/https://kotaku.com/sekiro-speedrunners-discover-wild-techniques-to-beat-th-1833720570|archive-date=May 31, 2019|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> A particularly effective form of sequence breaking is a \"credits warp\", a name for a sequence break which can teleport the player to the game's ending credits, examples of which can be found in ''[[Super Mario World]]''<ref name=\"PC MAG arbitrary code\">{{cite magazine|last=Murphy|first=David|date=2015-01-22|title=Speedrunner 'Beats' Super Mario World in Under 5 Minutes|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475640,00.asp|magazine=PC Magazine|access-date=April 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907034058/https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475640,00.asp|archive-date=September 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Ars\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/how-an-emulator-fueled-robot-reprogrammed-super-mario-world-on-the-fly/|title=How an emulator-fueled robot reprogrammed Super Mario World on the fly|last=Orland|first=Kyle|date=2014-01-14|website=Ars Technica|access-date=April 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330215134/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/how-an-emulator-fueled-robot-reprogrammed-super-mario-world-on-the-fly/|archive-date=March 30, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/speedrunners-shatter-ocarina-of-time-world-record-by-wa-1841045682|title=Speedrunners Shatter Ocarina of Time World Record By Warping Into The Credits|last=Alexandra|first=Heather|date=2020-01-16|website=Kotaku|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200303011152/https://kotaku.com/speedrunners-shatter-ocarina-of-time-world-record-by-wa-1841045682|archive-date=March 3, 2020|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''sequence break'' was first used in 2003 in an online [[Internet forum|discussion forum]] thread concerning the [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]] game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.{{refn|group=Note |name=OldMetroidTopics|Metroid 2002, a major Metroid speedrunning website, has retained back-ups of these topics that can be found at <tt>[http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php]</tt>.

When the activity became popular enough to accede to [[subculture]], the first sites dedicated to speedrunning started appearing\u2014usually specializing in just one or a few games. Some of these sites have sustained activity for a long time, sometimes even up to today, providing coverage of its members' achievements and serving as a platform for related discussions.\n\n=== COMPET-N (Doom) ===\nDecember 1993 saw the release of [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which allowed players to record demo files of their playthrough. The feature was first picked up by Christina \"Strunoph\" Norman in January 1994 when she launched the ''LMP Hall of Fame'' website.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\">{{cite web|url=https://www.doomworld.com/10years/demos/demos01.php|title=A Brief DOOM Demo History|author=Merrill, D.|year=2003|website=|publisher=Doomworld|accessdate=October 16, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901022601/http://www.doomworld.com/10years/demos/demos01.php|archive-date=September 1, 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThis site was, however, quickly followed up by the ''DOOM Honorific Titles'' (also known as the \"DHT\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/dht/dht6.html|title=Doom Honorific Titles|last=|first=|date=|website=Doom Honorific Titles|accessdate=28 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412060931/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/dht/dht6.html|archive-date=April 12, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> launched in May 1994 by Frank Stajano, which introduced the first serious competition between players.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3142599&did=1|title=Smashing the Clock|author=Turner, B.|year=2005|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=August 13, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220042/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3142599&did=1|archive-date=September 27, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> This site, designed around a notion of earning titles by successfully recording a particular type of demo on one of the predetermined maps in the \"[[Doom WAD|IWADs]]\", would create the basis for all ''Doom'' demo sites that would follow.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> These so-called \"exams\" became very popular as the player had to earn each title by submitting a demo of the feat to one of the site's judges to justify his application.

At the height of its popularity, the DHT had many different categories and playing styles.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> For example, playing with only the in-game fists and pistol, while killing all monsters on a map, became known as \"Tyson\" mode, named after the heavyweight boxer and former champion [[Mike Tyson]]. \"Pacifist mode\" was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each category had \"easy\", \"medium\", and \"hard\" difficulty maps for players to get randomly chosen for. As an authentication method to prevent players from submitting demos made by other people, it was required that they performed a distinct \"dance\" during their demo (often at the very beginning). With such varied categories, the DHT was appealing to a diverse group of players.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> However, the DHT had trouble retaining a permanent Internet location. This, combined with the constantly changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, caused public interest to wane as the years went by.\n\nIn November 1994, the definitive installment ''Doom'' speedrunning scene, in the form of the COMPET-N website, was launched.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> Its creator, Simon Widlake, intended the site to be a record scoreboard for a variety of ''Doom''-related achievements, but unlike its predecessors, they were all based on the idea of fast completion, thus making it the first actual speedrunning site. Players were challenged to run through ''Doom''<nowiki/>'s levels as fast as humanly possible in order to attain a spot on the constantly updated COMPET-N scoreboards, leading to demo material gradually amounting to hundreds of hours of recorded gameplay.<ref name=\"DoomStats\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | title = COMPET-N Database | publisher = Doom2.net | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | archivedate = April 12, 2014 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140412062105/http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLike the DOOM Honorific Titles, this site experienced multiple location changes over time; it was hosted on the ''[[Simtel]]'' servers for a while, before Istvan Pataki took over as maintainer and moved the site to a now defunct [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Technical University of Budapest]].

As is the case for the rest of the games in the series, highly [[nonlinear gameplay]] makes it possible for runners to search extensively for different routes towards the end of the game. In particular, the ability to perform sequence breaking has been researched thoroughly, leading to the discovery of ways to complete the games while obtaining only a small percentage of items. Prior to the inception of Metroid speedrunning, there were special websites which documented these so-called \"low-percentage\" completion possibilities.\n\nThe first game to be exceedingly popular with the speedrunning audience was ''[[Super Metroid]]'', released in 1994, which proved to lend itself to fast completion purposes very well.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> It featured a physics system that allowed for a wide array of skills for mobility, like \"wall jumping\" or the \"Shinespark\", allowing players to skip over large areas of the game, or play through the game in different manners based on how well they can perform these tricks in contextual situations. Additionally, it had the same nonlinear gameplay as its predecessors. Due to the way the game was laid out, several different run types or tiers that incorporate different completion percentages have been performed,{{refn|group=Note |name=TierFooter|A \"tier\", in this context, is a certain time-related goal that determines the strategy or route used in a speedrun. For example, a low-percentage speedrun is in a different tier than an any-percentage speedrun, as both have different completion goals.}} including any%, 100%, low%, and reverse boss order (RBO), in which the player beats the game's bosses in the opposite order they were meant to be played via sequence breaking.\n\nAs the Internet became more available to the general public, groups of players started collaborating on [[Internet forum|message boards]] to discuss these tricks with one another in what became a community based on playing the games speedily.\n\nThe first ''Metroid'' community that was created for the purpose of fast completion was ''Metroid Prime Discoveries'', created and led by Jean-Sebastien \"Zell\" Dubois.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|title=Lycos.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410072328/http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|archivedate=April 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Rather than being a site that focused on speedrunning, it was dedicated to documenting the possibilities of sequence breaking in the game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.

Players first started recording these special demos when Andy \"Aurican\" Kempling released a modified version of the ''Doom'' [[source code]] that made it possible to record demos in slow motion and in several sessions.

The knowledge that the video was constructed through tedious and careful selective replaying also raised some questions about the authenticity of video game replays; after all, if it is practically impossible to tell the videos of both kinds apart, one cannot possibly know whether a run was made with or without the use of a special emulator.

This often takes the form of a [[fan convention]] where runners get together to speedrun video games to raise money for charity, but may also be a purely online event. The most popular speedrun marathons are the biannual [[Games Done Quick]] marathon in the United States. Before the marathons, discussions take place on a forum, and runners submit their game choices. An online schedule is created that will show who is speedrunning, when they are speedrunning, and what game they are speedrunning. Their runs are streamed live at [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], and runners often provide commentary throughout the run to give viewers a better understanding of what is going on. Runners who are speedrunning often practice their game in a practice room at the event before their scheduled run as a warm up, or they practice at home beforehand. Speedrun marathons such as the Awesome Games Done Quick 2017 marathon have raised $2,222,934.52 for the [[Prevent Cancer Foundation]].<ref name=\"gdq2016total\">{{cite web|url=https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/donations/agdq2017|title=Donation Index|last=|first=|date=|website=Games Done Quick 2017|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202005327/https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/donations/agdq2017|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Competitive speedrunning ==\nThe first ever competitive speedrunning tournament was organized by the Global Speedrunning Association called PACE.

While all speedruns aim for quick completion, some speedruns are characterized by additional goals or limitations that players subject themselves to, such as collecting all key items or playing blindfolded. Players speedrun mainly to challenge themselves, to entertain and to compete with themselves and others. Players performing speedruns, called speedrunners, often record their attempts. These recordings are used to entertain others, to verify the completion time, to certify that all rules were followed, and to spot ways to further improve the completion time.{{refn|group=Note|name=DemoFormat|Although many speedruns are released as video recordings, which are often preferred due to being more universal,  some communities use a game's native demo recordings (such as the <tt>DEM</tt> format in by ''Quake'') since these are much more compact and easier to share with others. Such recordings require specific software to view, usually a version of the original game. Some communities release speedruns in both formats so that they become accessible to a larger audience.}}\n\nTo achieve a high level of play, speedrunners often have to reason about the game differently from the way that ordinary players might. Speedruns usually follow [[gameplay]] routes that are planned out carefully before they are attempted. Many games have opportunities to disarrange the intended sequence of events and skip entire parts of it \u2014 often called [[sequence breaking]] \u2014 and many more have programming mistakes, or [[glitch]]es, that a skillful player can exploit to their advantage. [[Tool-assisted speedrun]]ning is a type of speedrunning in which various computer tools are used to obtain performances which would be near-impossible for a human player, and are not held in competition with speedruns done by human players in real time, known as real-time speedruns.\n\nSome games are considered to be particularly suited to speedrunning and have [[virtual community|online communities]] dedicated to them, which can provide an active platform for discussing, publishing, and improving speedruns. Speedruns can be viewed on a variety of platforms, including [[Streaming media|live streams]] where players can carry out and share their attempts in real-time. Although speedrunning was originally not a widespread phenomenon, it has since grown to involve several active websites and an increasingly expansive assortment of speedrun videos that are freely and widely circulated on the Internet.\n\n== Glitches and sequence breaking ==\n{{main|Glitch|Sequence breaking}}\nWhile routing, it becomes apparent that some of the goals in the game do not need to be achieved for completion. Such elements include [[cutscene]]s that need to be watched before the player can progress, items that the player needs to possess in order to continue to a next stage or even entire parts of the gameplay that may convey a part of the game's plot or a subplot. Skipping a part of the game in such a fashion that it can be described as disjointed with the game's intended/common sequence of events is referred to as ''sequence breaking''.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/sekiro-speedrunners-discover-wild-techniques-to-beat-th-1833720570|title=Sekiro Speedrunners Discover Wild Techniques To Beat The Game In 40 Minutes|last=Degraffinried|first=Natalie|date=2019-04-01|website=Kotaku|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531090636/https://kotaku.com/sekiro-speedrunners-discover-wild-techniques-to-beat-th-1833720570|archive-date=May 31, 2019|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> A particularly effective form of sequence breaking is a \"credits warp\", a name for a sequence break which can teleport the player to the game's ending credits, examples of which can be found in ''[[Super Mario World]]''<ref name=\"PC MAG arbitrary code\">{{cite magazine|last=Murphy|first=David|date=2015-01-22|title=Speedrunner 'Beats' Super Mario World in Under 5 Minutes|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475640,00.asp|magazine=PC Magazine|access-date=April 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907034058/https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475640,00.asp|archive-date=September 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Ars\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/how-an-emulator-fueled-robot-reprogrammed-super-mario-world-on-the-fly/|title=How an emulator-fueled robot reprogrammed Super Mario World on the fly|last=Orland|first=Kyle|date=2014-01-14|website=Ars Technica|access-date=April 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330215134/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/how-an-emulator-fueled-robot-reprogrammed-super-mario-world-on-the-fly/|archive-date=March 30, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/speedrunners-shatter-ocarina-of-time-world-record-by-wa-1841045682|title=Speedrunners Shatter Ocarina of Time World Record By Warping Into The Credits|last=Alexandra|first=Heather|date=2020-01-16|website=Kotaku|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200303011152/https://kotaku.com/speedrunners-shatter-ocarina-of-time-world-record-by-wa-1841045682|archive-date=March 3, 2020|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''sequence break'' was first used in 2003 in an online [[Internet forum|discussion forum]] thread concerning the [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]] game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.{{refn|group=Note |name=OldMetroidTopics|Metroid 2002, a major Metroid speedrunning website, has retained back-ups of these topics that can be found at <tt>[http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php]</tt>.

At the height of its popularity, the DHT had many different categories and playing styles.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> For example, playing with only the in-game fists and pistol, while killing all monsters on a map, became known as \"Tyson\" mode, named after the heavyweight boxer and former champion [[Mike Tyson]]. \"Pacifist mode\" was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each category had \"easy\", \"medium\", and \"hard\" difficulty maps for players to get randomly chosen for. As an authentication method to prevent players from submitting demos made by other people, it was required that they performed a distinct \"dance\" during their demo (often at the very beginning). With such varied categories, the DHT was appealing to a diverse group of players.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> However, the DHT had trouble retaining a permanent Internet location. This, combined with the constantly changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, caused public interest to wane as the years went by.\n\nIn November 1994, the definitive installment ''Doom'' speedrunning scene, in the form of the COMPET-N website, was launched.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> Its creator, Simon Widlake, intended the site to be a record scoreboard for a variety of ''Doom''-related achievements, but unlike its predecessors, they were all based on the idea of fast completion, thus making it the first actual speedrunning site.

As is the case for the rest of the games in the series, highly [[nonlinear gameplay]] makes it possible for runners to search extensively for different routes towards the end of the game. In particular, the ability to perform sequence breaking has been researched thoroughly, leading to the discovery of ways to complete the games while obtaining only a small percentage of items. Prior to the inception of Metroid speedrunning, there were special websites which documented these so-called \"low-percentage\" completion possibilities.\n\nThe first game to be exceedingly popular with the speedrunning audience was ''[[Super Metroid]]'', released in 1994, which proved to lend itself to fast completion purposes very well.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> It featured a physics system that allowed for a wide array of skills for mobility, like \"wall jumping\" or the \"Shinespark\", allowing players to skip over large areas of the game, or play through the game in different manners based on how well they can perform these tricks in contextual situations. Additionally, it had the same nonlinear gameplay as its predecessors. Due to the way the game was laid out, several different run types or tiers that incorporate different completion percentages have been performed,{{refn|group=Note |name=TierFooter|A \"tier\", in this context, is a certain time-related goal that determines the strategy or route used in a speedrun. For example, a low-percentage speedrun is in a different tier than an any-percentage speedrun, as both have different completion goals.}} including any%, 100%, low%, and reverse boss order (RBO), in which the player beats the game's bosses in the opposite order they were meant to be played via sequence breaking.\n\nAs the Internet became more available to the general public, groups of players started collaborating on [[Internet forum|message boards]] to discuss these tricks with one another in what became a community based on playing the games speedily.\n\nThe first ''Metroid'' community that was created for the purpose of fast completion was ''Metroid Prime Discoveries'', created and led by Jean-Sebastien \"Zell\" Dubois.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|title=Lycos.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410072328/http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|archivedate=April 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Rather than being a site that focused on speedrunning, it was dedicated to documenting the possibilities of sequence breaking in the game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.

Players first started recording these special demos when Andy \"Aurican\" Kempling released a modified version of the ''Doom'' [[source code]] that made it possible to record demos in slow motion and in several sessions. A couple of months afterwards, in June 1999, the first site made for the purpose of sharing these demos, aptly called \"Tools-Assisted Speedruns\", was opened by Esko Koskimaa, Peo Sjoblom, and Yonatan Donner.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/>{{refn|group=Note |name=ToolsAssistedSpeedrun|Doom tool-assisted speedrunning is sometimes referred to as \"tools-assisted speedrunning\", after the first site used to share these demos.

I'm not going to redo the logo though.\"}}\n\nLike other such communities, the maintainers of the site stressed that their demos were for entertainment purposes rather than skill competitions, although the attempt to have the fastest time possible with tools itself became a competition as well.<ref name=\"AboutToolsAssistedSpeedruns\">{{cite web | year = 2000 | url = http://doomworld.com/tas/about.html | publisher = Internet Archive | title = Information about Tools-Assisted Speedruns | author = Koskimaa, E. | author2 = Sjoblom, P. | author3 = Donner, Y. | accessdate = April 8, 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000411175100/http://doomworld.com/tas/about.html | archivedate = April 11, 2000 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The site became a success, usually updating several times a week with demos recorded by its maintainers and submitted by its readers.

Although it was widely believed that the video was made by an extremely skilled player, it was actually the first tool-assisted speedrun made with a special emulator to generate widespread interest.{{refn|group=Note |name=EarlyTASVideos|There is evidence that several tool-assisted speedrun videos had been made before then, including a few others by Morimoto himself, but the Super Mario Bros. 3 video was the first to become popular with a general audience.}} When Morimoto detailed the making of the run on his website,<ref name=\"MorimotoExplanation\">{{cite web | year = 2003 | url = http://soramimi.egoism.jp/emu.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031203222907/http://soramimi.egoism.jp/emu.htm | archivedate = December 3, 2003 | title = emu | publisher = Internet Archive | author = \u3082\u308a\u3082\u3068 | accessdate =December 3, 2003}}</ref> many felt deceived and turned to criticizing the video's \"illegitimacy\" instead. The knowledge that the video was constructed through tedious and careful selective replaying also raised some questions about the authenticity of video game replays; after all, if it is practically impossible to tell the videos of both kinds apart, one cannot possibly know whether a run was made with or without the use of a special emulator. It was even feared that this fact would cause the downfall of competitive speedrunning.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> Neither the Speed Demos Archive nor Metroid 2002 have ever published runs that were known to be made with a special emulator.

The first real geographical intellect to emerge in [[United Kingdom]]'s geographical minds was [[Halford John Mackinder]], appointed reader at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1887.\n\nThe [[National Geographic Society]] was founded in the United States in 1888 and began publication of the ''National Geographic'' magazine which became, and continues to be, a great popularizer of geographic information. The society has long supported geographic research and education on geographical topics.\n\nThe Association of American Geographers was founded in 1904 and was renamed the [[American Association of Geographers]] in 2016 to better reflect the increasingly international character of its membership.\n\nOne of the first examples of geographic methods being used for purposes other than to describe and theorize the physical properties of the earth is [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s map of the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Though Snow was primarily a [[physician]] and a pioneer of [[epidemiology]] rather than a geographer, his map is probably one of the earliest examples of [[health geography]].\n\nThe now fairly distinct differences between the subfields of physical and human geography have developed at a later date. This connection between both physical and human properties of geography is most apparent in the theory of [[environmental determinism]], made popular in the 19th century by [[Carl Ritter]] and others, and has close links to the field of [[evolutionary biology]] of the time. Environmental determinism is the theory, that people's physical, mental and moral habits are directly due to the influence of their natural environment. However, by the mid-19th century, environmental determinism was under attack for lacking methodological rigor associated with modern science, and later as a means to justify [[racism]] and [[imperialism]].\n\nA similar concern with both human and physical aspects is apparent during the later 19th and first half of the 20th centuries focused on [[regional geography]]. The goal of regional geography, through something known as [[regionalisation]], was to delineate space into regions and then understand and describe the unique characteristics of each region through both human and physical aspects. With links to (possibilism) (geography) and [[cultural ecology]] some of the same notions of causal effect of the environment on society and culture remain with environmental determinism.\n\nBy the 1960s, however, the [[quantitative revolution]] led to strong criticism of regional geography. Due to a perceived lack of scientific rigor in an overly descriptive nature of the discipline, and a continued separation of geography from its two subfields of physical and human geography and from [[geology]], geographers in the mid-20th century began to apply statistical and mathematical models in order to solve spatial problems.<ref name=\"HGDICT\"/> Much of the development during the quantitative revolution is now apparent in the use of [[geographic information systems]]; the use of statistics, spatial modeling, and positivist approaches are still important to many branches of human geography. Well-known geographers from this period are [[Fred K. Schaefer]], [[Waldo Tobler]], [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]], [[Peter Haggett]], [[Richard Chorley|Richard J. Chorley]], [[William Bunge]], and [[Torsten H\u00e4gerstrand]].\n\nFrom the 1970s, a number of critiques of the positivism now associated with geography emerged. Known under the term '[[critical geography]],' these critiques signaled another turning point in the discipline. [[Behavioural geography|Behavioral geography]] emerged for some time as a means to understand how people made perceived spaces and places, and made locational decisions. The more influential 'radical geography' emerged in the 1970s and 1980s. It draws heavily on [[Marxist geography|Marxist]]'s theory and techniques, and is associated with geographers such as [[David Harvey]] and [[Richard Peet]]. Radical geographers seek to say meaningful things about problems recognized through quantitative methods,<ref>{{Cite book | author=Harvey, David| authorlink=David Harvey| title=Social Justice and the City| year=1973 | publisher=Edward Arnold | location=London | pages=128\u20139}}</ref> provide explanations rather than descriptions, put forward alternatives and solutions, and be politically engaged,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0066-4812&site=1 | title=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography: Celebrating Over 40 years of Radical Geography 1969-2009 | author=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography | year=2009 | accessdate=31 May 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010193949/http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0066-4812&site=1 | archivedate=10 October 2009 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> rather than using the detachment associated with positivists. (The detachment and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of the quantitative revolution was itself critiqued by radical geographers as being a tool of capital). Radical geography and the links to Marxism and related theories remain an important part of contemporary human geography (See: ''[[Antipode (journal)|Antipode]]''). Critical geography also saw the introduction of 'humanistic geography', associated with the work of [[Yi-Fu Tuan]], which pushed for a much more [[qualitative data|qualitative]] approach in methodology.\n\nThe changes under critical geography have led to contemporary approaches in the discipline such as [[feminist geography]], [[Cultural geography#\"New cultural geography\"|new cultural geography]], \"demonic\" geographies, and the engagement with [[postmodern]] and [[post-structural]] theories and philosophies.\n\n==Fields==\nThe primary fields of study in human geography focus around the core fields of:\n\n===Cultures===\n[[Cultural geography]] is the study of cultural products and norms - their variation across spaces and places, as well as their relations. It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language, religion, economy, government, and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Jordan-Bychkov, Terry G. |author2=Domosh, Mona |author3=Rowntree, Lester | title=The human mosaic: a thematic introduction to cultural geography | year=1994 | publisher=HarperCollinsCollegePublishers | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-06-500731-2 | pages=}}</ref> \n[[File:Agriculture_in_Asia.jpg|thumb|This picture shows terraced rice agriculture in Asia.]]\n\n* Subfields include: [[Social geography]], [[Animal geographies]], [[Language geography]], [[Sexuality and space]], [[Children's geographies]], and [[Religion and geography]].\n\n===Development===\n[[Development geography]] is the study of the Earth's geography with reference to the [[standard of living]] and the [[quality of life]] of its human inhabitants, study of the location, distribution and spatial organization of economic activities, across the Earth. The subject matter investigated is strongly influenced by the researcher's methodological approach.\n\n===Economies===\n[[File:Shan Street Bazaar.JPG|thumb|Economic Geography: [[Shan people|Shan]] street bazaar, market in Myanmar]]\n[[Economic geography]] examines relationships between human economic systems, states, and other factors, and the biophysical environment.\n* Subfields include: [[Marketing geography]] and [[Transportation geography]]\n\n===Health===\n\nMedical or [[health geography]] is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]]. Health geography deals with the spatial relations and patterns between people and the environment. This is a sub-discipline of human geography, researching how and why diseases are spread.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dummer|first=Trevor J.B.|date=2008-04-22|title=Health geography: supporting public health policy and planning|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=178|issue=9|pages=1177\u20131180|doi=10.1503/cmaj.071783|issn=0820-3946|pmc=2292766|pmid=18427094}}</ref>\n\n===Histories===\n[[Historical geography]] is the study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and \"real\" geographies of the past. Historical geography studies a wide variety of issues and topics. A common theme is the study of the geographies of the past and how a place or region changes through time. Many historical geographers study geographical patterns through time, including how people have interacted with their environment, and created the cultural landscape.\n\n===Politics===\n[[Political geography]] is concerned with the study of both the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures.\n* Subfields include: [[Electoral geography]], [[Geopolitics]], [[Strategic geography]] and [[Military geography]]\n\n===Population===\n[[Population geography]] is the study of ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to their environment or location.\n\n===Settlement===\n[[Settlement geography]], including [[urban geography]], is the study of [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural area]]s with specific regards to spatial, relational and theoretical aspects of settlement.  That is the study of areas which have a concentration of [[building]]s and [[infrastructure]].  These are areas where the majority of [[economy|economic]] activities are in the [[secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] and [[tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sectors]]. In case of urban settlement, they probably have a high [[population density]].\n{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Urbanism ===\n[[Urban geography]] is the study of cities, towns, and other areas of relatively dense settlement. Two main interests are site (how a settlement is positioned relative to the physical environment) and situation (how a settlement is positioned relative to other settlements). Another area of interest is the internal organization of urban areas with regard to different demographic groups and the layout of infrastructure. This subdiscipline also draws on ideas from other branches of Human Geography to see their involvement in the processes and patterns evident in an [[urban area]].<ref name=\"Palm\">{{Cite journal|last=Palm|first=Risa|date=2016-09-05|title=Urban geography: city structures|journal=Progress in Geography|volume=6|pages=89\u201395|language=en|doi=10.1177/030913258200600104}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |author1=Kaplan, Dave H. |author2=Holloway, Steven |author3=Wheeler, James O. |title=Urban Geography, 3rd.

The first real geographical intellect to emerge in [[United Kingdom]]'s geographical minds was [[Halford John Mackinder]], appointed reader at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1887.\n\nThe [[National Geographic Society]] was founded in the United States in 1888 and began publication of the ''National Geographic'' magazine which became, and continues to be, a great popularizer of geographic information. The society has long supported geographic research and education on geographical topics.\n\nThe Association of American Geographers was founded in 1904 and was renamed the [[American Association of Geographers]] in 2016 to better reflect the increasingly international character of its membership.\n\nOne of the first examples of geographic methods being used for purposes other than to describe and theorize the physical properties of the earth is [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s map of the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Though Snow was primarily a [[physician]] and a pioneer of [[epidemiology]] rather than a geographer, his map is probably one of the earliest examples of [[health geography]].\n\nThe now fairly distinct differences between the subfields of physical and human geography have developed at a later date. This connection between both physical and human properties of geography is most apparent in the theory of [[environmental determinism]], made popular in the 19th century by [[Carl Ritter]] and others, and has close links to the field of [[evolutionary biology]] of the time. Environmental determinism is the theory, that people's physical, mental and moral habits are directly due to the influence of their natural environment. However, by the mid-19th century, environmental determinism was under attack for lacking methodological rigor associated with modern science, and later as a means to justify [[racism]] and [[imperialism]].\n\nA similar concern with both human and physical aspects is apparent during the later 19th and first half of the 20th centuries focused on [[regional geography]]. The goal of regional geography, through something known as [[regionalisation]], was to delineate space into regions and then understand and describe the unique characteristics of each region through both human and physical aspects. With links to (possibilism) (geography) and [[cultural ecology]] some of the same notions of causal effect of the environment on society and culture remain with environmental determinism.\n\nBy the 1960s, however, the [[quantitative revolution]] led to strong criticism of regional geography. Due to a perceived lack of scientific rigor in an overly descriptive nature of the discipline, and a continued separation of geography from its two subfields of physical and human geography and from [[geology]], geographers in the mid-20th century began to apply statistical and mathematical models in order to solve spatial problems.<ref name=\"HGDICT\"/> Much of the development during the quantitative revolution is now apparent in the use of [[geographic information systems]]; the use of statistics, spatial modeling, and positivist approaches are still important to many branches of human geography. Well-known geographers from this period are [[Fred K. Schaefer]], [[Waldo Tobler]], [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]], [[Peter Haggett]], [[Richard Chorley|Richard J. Chorley]], [[William Bunge]], and [[Torsten H\u00e4gerstrand]].\n\nFrom the 1970s, a number of critiques of the positivism now associated with geography emerged. Known under the term '[[critical geography]],' these critiques signaled another turning point in the discipline. [[Behavioural geography|Behavioral geography]] emerged for some time as a means to understand how people made perceived spaces and places, and made locational decisions. The more influential 'radical geography' emerged in the 1970s and 1980s. It draws heavily on [[Marxist geography|Marxist]]'s theory and techniques, and is associated with geographers such as [[David Harvey]] and [[Richard Peet]]. Radical geographers seek to say meaningful things about problems recognized through quantitative methods,<ref>{{Cite book | author=Harvey, David| authorlink=David Harvey| title=Social Justice and the City| year=1973 | publisher=Edward Arnold | location=London | pages=128\u20139}}</ref> provide explanations rather than descriptions, put forward alternatives and solutions, and be politically engaged,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0066-4812&site=1 | title=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography: Celebrating Over 40 years of Radical Geography 1969-2009 | author=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography | year=2009 | accessdate=31 May 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010193949/http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0066-4812&site=1 | archivedate=10 October 2009 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> rather than using the detachment associated with positivists. (The detachment and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of the quantitative revolution was itself critiqued by radical geographers as being a tool of capital). Radical geography and the links to Marxism and related theories remain an important part of contemporary human geography (See: ''[[Antipode (journal)|Antipode]]''). Critical geography also saw the introduction of 'humanistic geography', associated with the work of [[Yi-Fu Tuan]], which pushed for a much more [[qualitative data|qualitative]] approach in methodology.\n\nThe changes under critical geography have led to contemporary approaches in the discipline such as [[feminist geography]], [[Cultural geography#\"New cultural geography\"|new cultural geography]], \"demonic\" geographies, and the engagement with [[postmodern]] and [[post-structural]] theories and philosophies.\n\n==Fields==\nThe primary fields of study in human geography focus around the core fields of:\n\n===Cultures===\n[[Cultural geography]] is the study of cultural products and norms - their variation across spaces and places, as well as their relations. It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language, religion, economy, government, and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Jordan-Bychkov, Terry G. |author2=Domosh, Mona |author3=Rowntree, Lester | title=The human mosaic: a thematic introduction to cultural geography | year=1994 | publisher=HarperCollinsCollegePublishers | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-06-500731-2 | pages=}}</ref> \n[[File:Agriculture_in_Asia.jpg|thumb|This picture shows terraced rice agriculture in Asia.]]\n\n* Subfields include: [[Social geography]], [[Animal geographies]], [[Language geography]], [[Sexuality and space]], [[Children's geographies]], and [[Religion and geography]].\n\n===Development===\n[[Development geography]] is the study of the Earth's geography with reference to the [[standard of living]] and the [[quality of life]] of its human inhabitants, study of the location, distribution and spatial organization of economic activities, across the Earth. The subject matter investigated is strongly influenced by the researcher's methodological approach.\n\n===Economies===\n[[File:Shan Street Bazaar.JPG|thumb|Economic Geography: [[Shan people|Shan]] street bazaar, market in Myanmar]]\n[[Economic geography]] examines relationships between human economic systems, states, and other factors, and the biophysical environment.\n* Subfields include: [[Marketing geography]] and [[Transportation geography]]\n\n===Health===\n\nMedical or [[health geography]] is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]]. Health geography deals with the spatial relations and patterns between people and the environment. This is a sub-discipline of human geography, researching how and why diseases are spread.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dummer|first=Trevor J.B.|date=2008-04-22|title=Health geography: supporting public health policy and planning|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=178|issue=9|pages=1177\u20131180|doi=10.1503/cmaj.071783|issn=0820-3946|pmc=2292766|pmid=18427094}}</ref>\n\n===Histories===\n[[Historical geography]] is the study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and \"real\" geographies of the past. Historical geography studies a wide variety of issues and topics. A common theme is the study of the geographies of the past and how a place or region changes through time. Many historical geographers study geographical patterns through time, including how people have interacted with their environment, and created the cultural landscape.\n\n===Politics===\n[[Political geography]] is concerned with the study of both the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures.\n* Subfields include: [[Electoral geography]], [[Geopolitics]], [[Strategic geography]] and [[Military geography]]\n\n===Population===\n[[Population geography]] is the study of ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to their environment or location.\n\n===Settlement===\n[[Settlement geography]], including [[urban geography]], is the study of [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural area]]s with specific regards to spatial, relational and theoretical aspects of settlement.  That is the study of areas which have a concentration of [[building]]s and [[infrastructure]].  These are areas where the majority of [[economy|economic]] activities are in the [[secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] and [[tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sectors]]. In case of urban settlement, they probably have a high [[population density]].\n{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Urbanism ===\n[[Urban geography]] is the study of cities, towns, and other areas of relatively dense settlement. Two main interests are site (how a settlement is positioned relative to the physical environment) and situation (how a settlement is positioned relative to other settlements). Another area of interest is the internal organization of urban areas with regard to different demographic groups and the layout of infrastructure. This subdiscipline also draws on ideas from other branches of Human Geography to see their involvement in the processes and patterns evident in an [[urban area]].<ref name=\"Palm\">{{Cite journal|last=Palm|first=Risa|date=2016-09-05|title=Urban geography: city structures|journal=Progress in Geography|volume=6|pages=89\u201395|language=en|doi=10.1177/030913258200600104}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |author1=Kaplan, Dave H. |author2=Holloway, Steven |author3=Wheeler, James O. |title=Urban Geography, 3rd.
