To achieve that the [[Fermat point]] is used to partition the triangle into three obtuse subtriangles with a <math>120^\\circ</math> angle and each of those subtriangles is replicated three times within the equilateral triangle next to it. This only works if every angle of the triangle is smaller than <math>120^\\circ</math>, since otherwise the Fermat point is not located in the interior of the triangle and becomes a vertex instead. However if one angle is greater or equal to <math>120^\\circ</math> it is possible to replicate the whole triangle three times within the largest equilateral triangle, so the sum of areas of all equilateral triangles stays greater than the threefold area of the triangle anyhow.\n\n== Further proofs ==\nThe proof of this inequality was set as a question in the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] of 1961.

From the first inequality we can also see that equality occurs only when <math>a = b = c</math> and the triangle is equilateral.\n\n===Third method===\n\nThis proof assumes knowledge of the [[AM\u2013GM inequality]].\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& & (a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2 & \\geq & & 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & & 2a^2+2b^2+2c^2 & \\geq & & 2ab+2bc+2ac \\\\\n\\iff & & 3(a^2+b^2+c^2) & \\geq & & (a + b + c)^2 \\\\\n\\iff & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\geq & & \\sqrt{3(a+b+c)\\left(\\frac{a+b+c}{3}\\right)^3} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\geq & & \\sqrt{3 (a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)} \\\\\n\\iff & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\geq & & 4 \\sqrt3 \\Delta.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAs we have used the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality, equality only occurs when <math>a = b = c</math> and the triangle is equilateral.\n\n===Fourth method===\n\nWrite <math>x=\\cot A, c=\\cot A+\\cot B>0</math> so the sum <math>S=\\cot A+\\cot B+\\cot C=c+\\frac{1-x(c-x)}{c}</math> and <math>cS=c^2-xc+x^2+1=\\left(x-\\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{c\\sqrt{3}}{2}-1\\right)^2+c\\sqrt{3}\\ge c\\sqrt{3}</math> i.e. <math>S\\ge\\sqrt{3}</math>.

Even so, the result is not too difficult to derive using [[Heron's formula]] for the area of a triangle:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta & {} =\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(a+b+c)(a+b-c)(b+c-a)(c+a-b)} \\\\\n& {} =\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)-(a^4+b^4+c^4)}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n=== First method ===\n\nIt can be shown that the area of the inner [[Napoleon's triangle]], which must be nonnegative, is<ref>Coxeter, H.S.M., and  Greitzer, Samuel L. ''Geometry Revisited'', page 64.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{24}(a^2+b^2+c^2-4\\sqrt{3}\\Delta),</math>\n\nso the expression in parentheses must be greater than or equal to 0.\n\n=== Second method ===\n\nThis method assumes no knowledge of inequalities except that all squares are nonnegative.\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n{} & (a^2 - b^2)^2 + (b^2 - c^2)^2 + (c^2 - a^2)^2 \\geq 0 \\\\\n{} \\iff & 2(a^4+b^4+c^4) - 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2) \\geq 0 \\\\\n{} \\iff & \\frac{4(a^4+b^4+c^4)}{3} \\geq \\frac{4(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)}{3} \\\\\n{} \\iff & \\frac{(a^4+b^4+c^4) + 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)}{3} \\geq 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)-(a^4+b^4+c^4) \\\\\n{} \\iff & \\frac{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2}{3} \\geq (4\\Delta)^2,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nand the result follows immediately by taking the positive square root of both sides. From the first inequality we can also see that equality occurs only when <math>a = b = c</math> and the triangle is equilateral.\n\n===Third method===\n\nThis proof assumes knowledge of the [[AM\u2013GM inequality]].\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& & (a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2 & \\geq & & 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & & 2a^2+2b^2+2c^2 & \\geq & & 2ab+2bc+2ac \\\\\n\\iff & & 3(a^2+b^2+c^2) & \\geq & & (a + b + c)^2 \\\\\n\\iff & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\geq & & \\sqrt{3(a+b+c)\\left(\\frac{a+b+c}{3}\\right)^3} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\geq & & \\sqrt{3 (a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)} \\\\\n\\iff & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\geq & & 4 \\sqrt3 \\Delta.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAs we have used the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality, equality only occurs when <math>a = b = c</math> and the triangle is equilateral.\n\n===Fourth method===\n\nWrite <math>x=\\cot A, c=\\cot A+\\cot B>0</math> so the sum <math>S=\\cot A+\\cot B+\\cot C=c+\\frac{1-x(c-x)}{c}</math> and <math>cS=c^2-xc+x^2+1=\\left(x-\\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{c\\sqrt{3}}{2}-1\\right)^2+c\\sqrt{3}\\ge c\\sqrt{3}</math> i.e. <math>S\\ge\\sqrt{3}</math>. But <math>\\cot A=\\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{4\\Delta}</math>, so <math>S=\\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{4\\Delta}</math>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of triangle inequalities]]\n*[[Isoperimetric inequality]]\n*[[Hadwiger\u2013Finsler inequality]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References & further reading==\n*Claudi Alsina, Roger B.

It was captured by the [[British East India Company]] after victory in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] (1799), who returned administrative control of the city to the [[Maharaja of Mysore]]. The old city developed in the dominions of the [[Maharaja of Mysore]] and was made capital of the [[Princely State of Mysore]], which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the [[British Raj]].\n\nIn 1809, the British shifted their [[Bangalore Cantonment|cantonment]] to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew up around it, which was governed as part of [[British India]].

The intermediate '''b''' is then added to a solution containing intermediate '''c''' dropwise. After quenching the reaction in a weakly acidic aqueous solution, a mixture of 1: 1 [[anomer]]s was obtained. It was then reacted with an excess of [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-78|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for 10 minutes. [[Trimethylsilyl triflate]] was added and reacts for one additional hour, and the mixture was quenched in an aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. A [[nitrile]] intermediate was obtained. The protective group, benzyl, was then removed with [[boron trichloride]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. The excess of boron trichloride was quenched in a mixture of potassium carbonate and methanol. A benzyl-free intermediate was obtained. The isomers were then separated via reversed-phase [[high-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]]. The optically pure compound and intermediate '''a''' are reacted with trimethyl phosphate and methylimidazole to obtain a [[diastereomer]] mixture of remdesivir. In the end, optically pure remdesivir can be obtained through [[chiral resolution]] methods.\n{{clear}}\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web | url =

It was then reacted with an excess of [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-78|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for 10 minutes. [[Trimethylsilyl triflate]] was added and reacts for one additional hour, and the mixture was quenched in an aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. A [[nitrile]] intermediate was obtained.

The excess of boron trichloride was quenched in a mixture of potassium carbonate and methanol. A benzyl-free intermediate was obtained.
