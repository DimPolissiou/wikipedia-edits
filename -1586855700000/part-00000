It has been maintained as a [[tourism]] booster for the city.  Since then, the term \"Conch Republic\" has been expanded to refer to \"all of the Florida Keys, or, that geographic apportionment of land that falls within the legally defined boundaries of [[Monroe County, Florida]], northward to 'Skeeter's Last Chance Saloon' in [[Florida City, Florida|Florida City]], [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County, Florida]], with Key West as the nation's capital and all territories north of Key West being referred to as 'The Northern Territories'{{-\"}}.<ref>[http://www.conchrepublic.com/history.htm A brief history of the Conch Republic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102113712/http://www.conchrepublic.com/history.htm |date=2012-11-02 }}</ref>\n\nWhile the protests that sparked the creation of the Conch Republic (and others since then) have been described by some as \"tongue-in-cheek,\" they were motivated by frustrations over genuine concerns. The original protest event was motivated by a [[U.S. Border Patrol]] roadblock and checkpoint that greatly inconvenienced residents and tourists.\n\nThe Conch Republic celebrates [[Independence Day]] every April 23 as part of a week-long festival of activities involving numerous businesses in Key West.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/obituaries/article1975803.html|title=Around Florida in late April: Conch Republic celebration in Key West plus events in Venic, Daytona, Orlando and St. Augustine|last=Cruz|first=Georgina|date=March 27, 2009|work=Orlando Sentinel|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref> The organization \u2014 a \"Sovereign State of Mind\", seeking only to bring more \"Humor, Warmth and Respect\" to a world in sore need of all three according to its late Secretary General, Peter Anderson \u2014 is a key tourism booster for the area.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/149318164/ Reno Gazette-Journal]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1982, the [[United States Border Patrol]] set up a roadblock and inspection point on [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|US 1]] just north of the merger of [[Card Sound Bridge|Monroe County Road 905A/Miami-Dade County Road 905A]] onto US 1 (they are the only two roads connecting the Florida Keys with the mainland), in front of the ''Last Chance Saloon'' just south of Florida City. Vehicles were stopped and searched for [[narcotics]] and [[illegal immigrant]]s. The Key West City Council complained repeatedly about the inconvenience for travelers to and from Key West, claiming that it hurt the Keys' important [[tourism]] industry. [[Eastern Air Lines]], which had a hub at [[Miami International Airport]], saw a window of opportunity when the roadblocks were established; Eastern was at the time the only [[airline]] to establish [[jet aircraft|jet]] service to [[Key West International Airport]], counting on travelers from Key West to Miami preferring to fly rather than to wait for police to search their vehicles.\n\nWhen the City Council's complaints went unanswered by the U.S. federal government and attempts to get an [[injunction]] against the roadblock failed in court, as a form of protest Mayor [[Dennis Wardlow]] and the council declared Key West's independence on April 23, 1982. In the eyes of the council, since the U.S. federal government had set up the equivalent of a border station as if they were a foreign nation, they might as well become one. As many of the local citizens were referred to as [[Conch (people)|Conchs]], the nation took the name of the Conch Republic.\n\nAs part of the protest, Mayor Wardlow was proclaimed [[Prime Minister]] of the Republic, which immediately [[Declaration of war|declared war]] against the United States (symbolically breaking a loaf of stale [[Cuban bread]] over the head of a man dressed in a naval uniform), quickly surrendered after one minute (to the man in the uniform), and applied for one billion [[United States dollar|dollars]] in [[foreign aid]].\n\nConch Republic officials were invited to the [[Summit of the Americas]] in [[Miami]] in 1994, and Conch representatives were officially invited to 1995's Florida Jubilee.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Micronations |author=John Ryan, George Dunford & Simon Sellars |publisher=Lonely Planet Publications |year=2006 |isbn=1-74104-730-7 |page=131}}</ref>\n\nThe faux secession and the events surrounding it generated great publicity for the Keys' plight \u2014 the roadblock and inspection station were removed soon afterward. It also resulted in the creation of a new avenue of tourism for the Keys.\n\n===Invasions of 1995===\n\nOn September 20, 1995, it was reported that the [[478th Civil Affairs Battalion]] of the [[United States Army Reserve]] was to conduct a training exercise simulating an invasion of a foreign island. They were to land on Key West and conduct affairs as if the islanders were foreign. However, no one from the 478th notified Conch officials of the exercise.\n\nSeeing another chance at publicity, Wardlow and the forces behind the 1982 Conch Republic secession mobilized the island for a full-scale war, sending the schooner [[Western Union (schooner)|''Western Union'']] out to attack an incoming Coast Guard Cutter with water balloons, conch fritters and stale Cuban bread, to which the Coast Guard responded with their fire hoses (quickly ending the battle), and protested to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] for arranging this exercise without consulting the City of Key West. The leaders of the 478th issued an apology the next day, saying they \"in no way meant to challenge or impugn the sovereignty of the Conch Republic\", and submitted to a surrender ceremony on September 22.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Micronations|author=John Ryan, George Dunford & Simon Sellars|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|year=2006|isbn=1-74104-730-7|pages=133}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[United States federal government shutdowns of 1995 and 1995\u201396|U.S. federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996]], as a protest, the Republic sent a flotilla of Conch Navy civilian and fire department boats to [[Fort Jefferson, Florida|Fort Jefferson]], located in [[Dry Tortugas National Park]], to reopen it. The action was dubbed a \"full scale invasion\" by the Conch Republic. Inspired by efforts of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] to keep its museums open by private donations, local residents had raised private money to keep the park running (a closed park would damage the tourist-dependent local economy), but could find no one to accept the money and reopen the park.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nWhen officials attempted to enter the monument, they were cited.

The move was in response to a recent event regarding [[Cuba]]n [[refugee]]s. On the previous January 4, fifteen Cuban refugees reached the bridge, but were returned to Cuba by the U.S. Border Patrol because the U.S. government had declared the bridge a \"wet feet\" location under the ''[[wet feet, dry feet policy]]''. The rationale was that, since two sections of the span had been removed and it was no longer connected to land, it was not part of U.S. territory subject to the \"dry feet\" rule, and thus the refugees could not stay.\n\nAnderson, seizing upon the U.S.'s apparent disavowal of the abandoned span, claimed it for the Republic. He expressed hope to use the bridge for affordable, ecologically friendly housing. In response, Russel Schweiss, spokesman for Florida governor [[Jeb Bush]], declared \"With all due respect to the Conch Republic, the bridge belongs to all the people of Florida, and we're not currently in negotiations to sell it.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/01/14/State/Conchs_roar_to_bridge.shtml |title=Conchs roar to bridge annexation |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=2006-01-14}}</ref> The refugee decision was later overturned, but only after the refugees had been returned to Cuba.\n\n===Recent history===\nIn another protest, beginning in 2008, the northern keys including Key Largo formed a separation of the Conch Republic known as the Independent Northernmost Territories of the Conch Republic. Proponents claim this separation is a result of disagreements over the definition and use of the term 'Conch Republic'.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://keysnews.com/node/8892 |title=Insurrection in the Conch Republic |publisher=[[KeysNews.com]] |date=2008-12-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231223419/http://keysnews.com/node/8892 |archivedate=2008-12-31 }}</ref>\n\n==Souvenir passports and vehicle registration==\n[[File:Conch Republic flag on balcony.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A Conch Republic flag hanging from a balcony.]]\nThrough their website, the Republic issues [[Fantasy passport|souvenir passport]]s.

Vehicles were stopped and searched for [[narcotics]] and [[illegal immigrant]]s. The Key West City Council complained repeatedly about the inconvenience for travelers to and from Key West, claiming that it hurt the Keys' important [[tourism]] industry. [[Eastern Air Lines]], which had a hub at [[Miami International Airport]], saw a window of opportunity when the roadblocks were established; Eastern was at the time the only [[airline]] to establish [[jet aircraft|jet]] service to [[Key West International Airport]], counting on travelers from Key West to Miami preferring to fly rather than to wait for police to search their vehicles.\n\nWhen the City Council's complaints went unanswered by the U.S. federal government and attempts to get an [[injunction]] against the roadblock failed in court, as a form of protest Mayor [[Dennis Wardlow]] and the council declared Key West's independence on April 23, 1982. In the eyes of the council, since the U.S. federal government had set up the equivalent of a border station as if they were a foreign nation, they might as well become one. As many of the local citizens were referred to as [[Conch (people)|Conchs]], the nation took the name of the Conch Republic.\n\nAs part of the protest, Mayor Wardlow was proclaimed [[Prime Minister]] of the Republic, which immediately [[Declaration of war|declared war]] against the United States (symbolically breaking a loaf of stale [[Cuban bread]] over the head of a man dressed in a naval uniform), quickly surrendered after one minute (to the man in the uniform), and applied for one billion [[United States dollar|dollars]] in [[foreign aid]].\n\nConch Republic officials were invited to the [[Summit of the Americas]] in [[Miami]] in 1994, and Conch representatives were officially invited to 1995's Florida Jubilee.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Micronations |author=John Ryan, George Dunford & Simon Sellars |publisher=Lonely Planet Publications |year=2006 |isbn=1-74104-730-7 |page=131}}</ref>\n\nThe faux secession and the events surrounding it generated great publicity for the Keys' plight \u2014 the roadblock and inspection station were removed soon afterward. It also resulted in the creation of a new avenue of tourism for the Keys.\n\n===Invasions of 1995===\n\nOn September 20, 1995, it was reported that the [[478th Civil Affairs Battalion]] of the [[United States Army Reserve]] was to conduct a training exercise simulating an invasion of a foreign island. They were to land on Key West and conduct affairs as if the islanders were foreign. However, no one from the 478th notified Conch officials of the exercise.\n\nSeeing another chance at publicity, Wardlow and the forces behind the 1982 Conch Republic secession mobilized the island for a full-scale war, sending the schooner [[Western Union (schooner)|''Western Union'']] out to attack an incoming Coast Guard Cutter with water balloons, conch fritters and stale Cuban bread, to which the Coast Guard responded with their fire hoses (quickly ending the battle), and protested to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] for arranging this exercise without consulting the City of Key West. The leaders of the 478th issued an apology the next day, saying they \"in no way meant to challenge or impugn the sovereignty of the Conch Republic\", and submitted to a surrender ceremony on September 22.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Micronations|author=John Ryan, George Dunford & Simon Sellars|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|year=2006|isbn=1-74104-730-7|pages=133}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[United States federal government shutdowns of 1995 and 1995\u201396|U.S. federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996]], as a protest, the Republic sent a flotilla of Conch Navy civilian and fire department boats to [[Fort Jefferson, Florida|Fort Jefferson]], located in [[Dry Tortugas National Park]], to reopen it. The action was dubbed a \"full scale invasion\" by the Conch Republic. Inspired by efforts of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] to keep its museums open by private donations, local residents had raised private money to keep the park running (a closed park would damage the tourist-dependent local economy), but could find no one to accept the money and reopen the park.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nWhen officials attempted to enter the monument, they were cited.

The move was in response to a recent event regarding [[Cuba]]n [[refugee]]s. On the previous January 4, fifteen Cuban refugees reached the bridge, but were returned to Cuba by the U.S. Border Patrol because the U.S. government had declared the bridge a \"wet feet\" location under the ''[[wet feet, dry feet policy]]''. The rationale was that, since two sections of the span had been removed and it was no longer connected to land, it was not part of U.S. territory subject to the \"dry feet\" rule, and thus the refugees could not stay.\n\nAnderson, seizing upon the U.S.'s apparent disavowal of the abandoned span, claimed it for the Republic. He expressed hope to use the bridge for affordable, ecologically friendly housing. In response, Russel Schweiss, spokesman for Florida governor [[Jeb Bush]], declared \"With all due respect to the Conch Republic, the bridge belongs to all the people of Florida, and we're not currently in negotiations to sell it.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/01/14/State/Conchs_roar_to_bridge.shtml |title=Conchs roar to bridge annexation |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=2006-01-14}}</ref> The refugee decision was later overturned, but only after the refugees had been returned to Cuba.\n\n===Recent history===\nIn another protest, beginning in 2008, the northern keys including Key Largo formed a separation of the Conch Republic known as the Independent Northernmost Territories of the Conch Republic.
