A conservative [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he was also the [[Governor of South Carolina]] and the 77th [[List of lieutenant governors of South Carolina|Lieutenant Governor]] of South Carolina. He served alongside Democrat turned [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] for 36 years, making them the longest-serving Senate duo in history. At the time of his death, he was the [[List of longest-living United States Senators|oldest living former U.S. Senator]].\n\nBorn in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], Hollings graduated from [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]] in 1942 and joined a law practice in Charleston after attending the [[University of South Carolina School of Law]]. During [[World War II]], he served as an artillery officer in campaigns in [[North Africa]] and [[Europe]]. After the war, Hollings successively won election to the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]], as Lieutenant Governor, and as Governor. He sought election to the Senate in 1962 but was defeated by incumbent [[Olin D. Johnston]].\n\nJohnston died in 1965, and the following year Hollings won a special election to serve the remainder of Johnston's term. Though the Republican Party became increasingly dominant in South Carolina after 1966, Hollings remained popular and continually won re-election, becoming [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service|one of the longest-serving Senators]] in U.S. history. Hollings sought the Democratic nomination in the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 presidential election]] but dropped out of the race after the [[New Hampshire primary]]. He declined to seek re-election in 2004 and was succeeded by Republican [[Jim DeMint]].\n\n==Early life==\nHollings was born in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the son of Wilhelmine Dorothea Meyer (1888\u20131982) and Adolph Gevert Hollings, Sr. (1882\u20131940).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thetimeisnow.us/senators/southcarolina/sc_hollings.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 25, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518084927/http://www.thetimeisnow.us/senators/southcarolina/sc_hollings.htm |archivedate=May 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&dat=19820823&id=hpUiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7KkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6490,7966513 |title=Mrs. Hollings Services |date=1982-08-23 |work=The Sumter Daily Item |via=Google News Archive}}</ref> He was of German descent.<ref>{{Cite book |title=New Politics in the Old South |last=Ballantyne |first=David T. |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-61117-704-6 |jstor=j.ctv6sj8ws}}</ref> Hollings was raised at 338 President St. in the [[Hampton Park Terrace]] neighborhood from the age of 10 until he enrolled in college.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Education==\nHollings graduated from [[The Citadel (Military College)|The Citadel]] in 1942, receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree.

He also called for and achieved significant increases in teachers' salaries, bringing them closer to the regional average.

Johnston]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===United States Senator===\n====Early Senate career====\n[[File:Ernest Hollings 91st Congress.jpg|thumb|Hollings in 1969]]\nJohnston died on April 18, 1965. Hollings' successor as governor, [[Donald S. Russell]], resigned in order to accept appointment to the Senate seat. In the summer of 1966, Hollings defeated Russell in the Democratic primary for the remaining two years of the term. He then narrowly won the special election on November 8, 1966, against the Democrat-turned-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Marshall Parker]], and was sworn in shortly thereafter. He gained seniority on other newly elected U.S. senators who would have to wait until January 1967 to take the oath of office. In 1967, he was one of eleven senators who voted against the nomination of [[Thurgood Marshall]] to become the first black justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. The following year, Hollings won the Senate seat for his first full term when he again defeated Marshall Parker but in this instance by a much wider margin.\n\nFor thirty-six years (until January 2003), he served alongside Republican Strom Thurmond, making them the longest-serving Senate duo in the history of the United States to date. This also made Hollings the longest-serving junior senator, even though he had more seniority than all but a few of his colleagues. Thurmond and Hollings generally had a good relationship despite their sometimes sharp philosophical differences, and frequently collaborated on legislation and projects to benefit South Carolina. Their combined seniority gave South Carolina clout in national politics well beyond its relatively small population. Only Thurmond, [[Robert Byrd]], [[Ted Kennedy]], [[Daniel Inouye]], [[Carl Hayden]], [[John Stennis]], [[Ted Stevens]], [[Patrick Leahy|Pat Leahy]], [[Orrin Hatch]], and [[Thad Cochran]] have served longer in the Senate than did Hollings.\n\nIn 1970, Hollings authored ''The Case Against Hunger: A Demand for a National Policy'', acknowledging the Reverend I.D. Newman and Sister Mary Anthony for opening his eyes to the despair caused by hunger and helping him realize that he must do something about it.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Case Against Hunger: A Demand for a National Policy|year= 1970|publisher= Cowles Book Company, Inc.|location= New York|isbn= 0402126114|author= Hollings, Ernest|url= https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_k8q0}}</ref> Hollings made headlines the year before when he toured poverty-stricken areas of South Carolina, often referred to as his \"Hunger Tours.\" He was accused of drawing unwanted attention to South Carolina when other states \u2014 North and South \u2014 also faced extreme poverty. Hollings knew South Carolina was not alone in its struggle and thought that if any politician was going to investigate hunger in South Carolina, it was going to at least be a South Carolinian. After a tour of an East Charleston slum, he said, \"I don't want [[George W. Romney|Romney]] and [[Ted Kennedy|Kennedy]] coming here to look at my slums. As a matter of fact when I get caught up with my work, I think I may go look at the slums of Boston.\"<ref>Robertson, Glenn (January 11, 1968). \"Hollings 'Angered' by Tour of Slums.\" Charleston, S.C.: ''Evening Post''.</ref> For his efforts, Hollings was also accused of \"scheming for the Negro vote.\" Hollings, who had seen plenty of white hunger and poverty and slums on his tours, responded, \"You just don't make political points on hunger. The poor aren't registered to vote and they won't vote.\"<ref>Pyatt, \"The Beginning of a Rennaissance {{sic}} in Dixie?\".</ref> In February 1969, however, Hollings testified as to what he had seen on his fact-finding tours in front of the [[Senate Select Committee on Hunger and Human Needs]]. Charleston's ''News and Courier'' (now ''[[The Post and Courier]]'') reported that \"Senators, members of the press corps and visitors packed in the hearing room watched and listened in disbelief as Hollings detailed dozens of tragically poignant scenes of human suffering in his state.\"<ref name=Pyatt>{{cite news |author= Pyatt, Rudolph|date= February 23, 1969|title= The Beginning of a Rennaissance {{sic}} in Dixie|newspaper= News and Courier|location= Charleston, S.C.}}</ref> Hollings recommended to the committee that free [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] be distributed to the most needy, and just over a day later, Senator [[George McGovern]] announced that free food stamps would be distributed in South Carolina as part of a national pilot program for feeding the hungry.<ref name=Pyatt/>\n\nHollings and his first wife separated in 1970 and divorced in 1971. Their children lived with their mother, and Hollings never discussed the reason for the divorce. Later that year, he married Rita Liddy \"Peatsy\" Hollings (born 1935), who was 13 years his junior.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.postandcourier.com/news/peatsy-hollings-wife-of-former-sen-fritz-hollings-dies-at/article_03100699-9166-58cf-8fda-cb262738cd17.html|title=Peatsy Hollings, wife of former Sen.

Hollings said President Nixon had led the U.S. down a \"clamorous road of drift and division\" and criticized the \"ranting rhetoric\" of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]]. Hollings attributed the principal blame for the disunity of the U.S. on special interest groups and \"impatient minority blocs\" that had shouted \"non negotiable demands\". Hollings linked former President Johnson and President Nixon with having both \"attacked the politics of the problem rather than the problems themselves.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/26/archives/hollings-attacks-nixon-on-discord-he-says-the-administration-feeds.html|title=HOLLINGS ATTACKS NIXON ON DISCORD|date=September 26, 1970|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1971, Hollings introduced Ted Kennedy in Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of his remarks calling for an end to the [[Vietnam War]]. Hollings disclosed that Kennedy had sought his advice on how to answer reporters' questions regarding a possible presidential campaign and that Kennedy was of the belief that his visit would spark speculation on the part of reporters about a campaign regardless of what he said.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/01/archives/kennedy-in-visit-to-carolina-cites-calhoun-but-not-sherman.html|title=Kennedy, in Visit to Carolina, Cites Calhoun But Not\u2010Sherman|date=March 1, 1971|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1971, Hollings announced his opposition to the nomination of [[Earl Butz]] for [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/27/archives/kansas-republican-joins-foes-of-butz.html|title=KANSAS REPUBLICAN JOINS FOES OF BUTZ|date=November 27, 1971|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Hollings and Republican [[William Saxbe]] sponsored a resolution bestowing early United States recognition on [[Bangladesh]] as the Nixon administration sought a policy of delaying recognition until \"there were commensurate diplomatic benefits to the United States.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/03/archives/kennedy-fears-new-pakistan-arms-aid.html|title=Kennedy Fears New Pakistan Arms Aid|first=Benjamin|last=Welles|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Hollings was one of five Democrats to vote against the nomination of [[F.

Hollings was one of four members of the committee to oppose Vance's request during the latter's appearance before the subcommittee and Hollings later sent a letter to Vance declining the request. Hollings explained that \"a smooth transition to unofficial relations may be threatened\" in the event of funds not being transferred to the American Institute before the American Embassy in Taiwan ceased its function by its designated date of March 1. Hollings' opposition was considered unusual given that most requests were approved and State Department officials publicly stated their wishes for Hollings and his colleagues to drop their opposition in the face of Taiwan's reluctant agreement to setting up \"nongovernmental body in Washington\" that would serve as the counterpart to the American Institute in Taipei.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/13/archives/senate-panel-balks-at-letting-us-shift-funds-to-new-office-in.html|title=Senate Panel Balks at Letting U.S. Shift Funds to New Office in Taipei|first=Bernard|last=Gwertzman|date=February 13, 1979|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Hollings opposed legislation enabling the United States to admit 1,000 additional Indochinese refugees a month amid increased concern in both the Carter administration and Congress regarding moves by the Vietnamese government to force ethnic Chinese to flee the country at a rate of about 60,000 a month.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/26/archives/senate-votes-funds-for-more-refugees-growing-concern-for-refugees.html|title=Senate Votes Funds for More Refugees|date=June 26, 1979|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1979, Hollings announced his opposition to the United States-Soviet Union nuclear arms treaty, saying the treaty should be defeated unless amended with a reduction of Soviet military power. His proposal was believed to stir Russian disapproval of the treaty if implemented. Hollings also made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the [[Senate Budget Committee]] to add $2.6 billion for a recommendation for military spending that would be included in Congress's second concurrent resolution on the budget.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/04/archives/senators-appeal-to-carter-to-resist-linking-arms-treaty-and.html|title=Senators Appeal to Carter to Resist Linking Arms Treaty and Spending|date=August 4, 1979|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\n====Presidential candidate====\nHollings unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for [[President of the United States]] in [[1984 United States presidential election|the presidential election of 1984]]. Hollings' wit and experience, as well as his call for a [[budget freeze]], won him some positive attention, but his relatively conservative record alienated liberal Democrats, and he was never really noticed in a field dominated by [[Walter Mondale]], [[John Glenn]] and [[Gary Hart]]. Hollings dropped out two days after losing badly in the [[New Hampshire Primary]], and endorsed Hart a week later. His disdain for his competitors sometimes showed. He notably referred to Mondale as a \"lapdog\" and to former Astronaut Glenn as a \"[[Sky King]]\" who was \"confused in his capsule.\"<ref name = \"The Citadel Archives: Hollings, Ernest, 1922\">{{cite web | url = http://www3.citadel.edu/archivesguide/index.php/HOLLINGS,_ERNEST,_1922 | title = The Citadel Archives: Hollings, Ernest, 1922}}</ref>\n\n====Later Senate career====\nOn March 24, 1981, Hollings introduced legislation that if passed would restore the military draft with limited deferments and exemptions and stipulating that men aged 18 to 22 years old would be required to spend nine months of active service for basic training that potentially would precede reserve duty. Hollings' proposal granted deferments \"to people on active duty, in the reserves or in advanced [[Reserve Officers Training Corps]] study; surviving sons or brothers of those killed in war or missing in action; conscientious objectors and ministers; doctors and others in vital health professions, and judges of courts of record and elected officials.\" Hollings stated that recruiting for the armed forces had fallen short of requirements by an estimated 23,000 people in 1979 and that he believed the draft applying to women \"should be across the board\" due to the issue continuing to be debated between the public and the courts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/25/us/bill-introduced-in-senate-to-reinstate-the-draft.html|title=Bill Introduced in Senate To Reinstate the Draft|date=March 25, 1981|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Hollings apologized to fellow Democrat [[Howard Metzenbaum]] after Hollings referred to him as the \"senator from [[B'nai B'rith]]\" on the floor. Metzenbaum, who was Jewish, raised a [[Question of privilege|point of personal privilege]] and Hollings's remarks were stricken from the record.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/16/us/a-senator-s-cannibal-joke-angers-blacks.html|title=A Senator's Cannibal 'Joke' Angers Blacks|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 16, 1993|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1985, the Senate Budget Committee approved a proposal sponsored by Hollings freezing military spending by not allowing any growth above inflation in fiscal year 1986 and bestowing three percent hikes in the following two years, Hollings after the vote saying that a pattern had been set for similar action on other budget items and predicted that the Budget Committee would also go against another Reagan administration supported position by freezing Social Security cost of living increases.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/biddeford-journal-tribune-mar-06-1985-p-4/|title=Budget freezers extend the chill|date=March 6, 1985|publisher=Journal Tribune}}</ref>\n\nOn May 1, 1985, the [[Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation]] rejected an amendment to a bill reauthorizing the [[Federal Communications Commission]] prohibiting public television stations from swapping channels with commercial stations, Hollings afterward stating that the vote was \"a tragic abdication by Congress of its over 60-year-old responsibility to protect the public's interest in broadcasting.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/01/arts/senate-panel-rejects-ban-on-channel-swaps.html|title=SENATE PANEL REJECTS BAN ON CHANNEL SWAPS|date=May 1, 1985|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1985, Hollings and Republicans [[Phil Gramm]] and [[Warren Rudman]] sponsored an amendment to establish a budget deficit ceiling that would decline to zero by 1991 that was attached to a bill raising the [[debt limit]] of the federal government by more than $250 billion. The amendment was approved by a vote of 75 to 24 and was stated as a possible prelude to a balanced budget in five years without a tax increase by [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[James Baker]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/14/us/treasury-head-defends-plan-for-ending-deficit.html|title=Treasury Head Defends Plan for Ending Deficit|date=October 14, 1985|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 Presidential primaries]], Hollings endorsed [[Jesse Jackson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55210|title=Our Campaigns - US President - D Primaries Race - Feb 01, 1988|website=www.ourcampaigns.com}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1989, Hollings announced from his Washington office that he would request the [[General Accounting Office]] investigate efforts by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] to provide timely assistance and funds to victims of [[Hurricane Hugo]] the previous month. Hollings charged FEMA with \"stonewalling, fretting and filling out forms\" and called on the federal government to become more active in trying to relieve areas devastated by Hurricane Hugo.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/10/03/Hollings-calls-for-FEMA-investigation/4897623390400/|title=Hollings calls for FEMA investigation|date=October 3, 1989|publisher=UPI}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1990, Hollings planned the compiling of the Senate Budget Committee to vote on a cut in [[Social Security tax]]es, an idea initially forwarded at the end of the previous year by fellow Democratic senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] as a way of making Congress address what he considered to be a serious problem in the management of the Social Security trust funds. Hollings sought a revenue figure which reflected the $36 billion tax cut through a rollback of Social Security payroll taxes increases that were scheduled to take effect January 1 and confirmed he would ask his colleagues on the budget committee to remove the trust funds from the budget deficit calculation and vote on the 1991 budget including a $300 billion deficit. Hollings' plan included a 5 percent [[value-added tax]] on goods and services in addition to a 10 percent oil import fee as well as an increase in the top income tax rate to 33 percent among wealthiest taxpayers. The goal was considered an uphill battle where Hollings could be outmaneuvered in committee with parliamentary tactics that would result in the precluding of a straight up-or-down vote on the Social Security tax cut. Acknowledging this, Hollings said, \"They may try to block me. But we will find a bill by God to cut Social Security taxes. There will be a vote.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/24/us/decision-is-urged-on-social-security.html|title=DECISION IS URGED ON SOCIAL SECURITY|date=April 24, 1990|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1991, Hollings joined most Democratic senators in voting against a resolution authorizing war against Iraq.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/01/12/Senate-vote-authorizing-military-force-against-Iraq/3439806032531/|title=Senate vote authorizing military force against Iraq|date=January 12, 1991|publisher=UPI}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Hollings told reporters that he attended international summits because, \"Everybody likes to go to [[Geneva]]. I used to do it for the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea conferences]] and you'd find those potentates from down in [[Africa]], you know, rather than eating each other, they'd just come up and get a good square meal in Geneva.\"<ref name=nyt/>  Hollings had previously caused controversy when responding to [[Yoshio Sakurauchi]]'s commentary that Americans are lazy and illiterate.  Hollings replied, \"You should draw a mushroom cloud and put underneath it, 'Made in America by lazy and illiterate Americans and tested in Japan'.\"<ref name=nyt/>\n\nHollings remained very popular in South Carolina over the years, even as the state became increasingly friendly to Republicans at the national level. In his first three bids for a full term, he never dropped below 60 percent of the vote. In [[United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1992|the 1992 election]], however, he faced an unexpectedly close race against former Congressman [[Tommy Hartnett]] in what was otherwise a very good year for Democrats nationally. Hartnett had represented the Charleston area in Congress from 1981 to 1987, thus making him Hollings' congressman. His appeal in the [[Lowcountry]] \u2013 traditionally a swing region at the state level \u2013 enabled him to hold Hollings to only 50 percent of the vote.\n\nIn his last [[United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1998|Senate race in 1998]], Hollings faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] congressman [[Bob Inglis]]. One of the more heated moments of the race was a newspaper interview in which Hollings referred to Inglis as a \"goddamn skunk\". Hollings was re-elected 52%\u201345%.\n\nOn January 7, 2003, Hollings introduced the controversial Universal National Service Act of 2006, which would require all men and women aged 18\u201326 (with some exceptions) to perform a year of military service.\n\n[[Image:Fritz Hollings press photo, color.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Senator Ernest Hollings]]\nOn August 4, 2003, he announced that he would not run for re-election in November 2004. Republican [[Jim DeMint]] succeeded him.\n\nAs a senator, Hollings supported legislation in the interests of the established media distribution industry (such as the proposed \"[[Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act]]\"). His hard-line support of various [[client-side]] computer restrictions such as [[Digital rights management|DRM]] and [[Trusted computing]] led the [[Fritz chip]] (a microchip that enforces such restrictions) to be nicknamed after him. Hollings also sponsored the [[Online Personal Privacy Act]].<ref>(S. 2201)</ref>\n\nIn his later career, Hollings was moderate politically but was supportive of many [[civil rights]] bills. He voted for re-authorizing the [[Voting Rights Act]] in 1982. However, in 1967 he was one of the 11 senators who voted against the confirmation of [[Thurgood Marshall]], the first black [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] justice.<ref>https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/240_1967.pdf</ref> Hollings later voted in favor of the failed nomination of [[Robert Bork]] and also for the successful nomination of [[Clarence Thomas]].\n\nOn fiscal issues, he was generally conservative, and was one of the primary sponsors of the [[Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act]], an attempt to enforce limits on government spending.\n\nHollings and [[Howell Heflin]] of [[Alabama]] were the only two Democratic senators to vote against the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&session=1&vote=00011|title=U.S. Senate: U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 103rd Congress - 1st Session|website=www.senate.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Post Senatorial life and death==\n[[Image:Hollings Judicial Center in Charleston, SC IMG 4576.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The [[J.

His opinion editorials were also published every week in EconomyInCrisis.org, an independent protectionist news blog. In 2008, [[the University of South Carolina Press]] published ''Making Government Work'', a book authored by Hollings with Washington, D.C., journalist Kirk Victor, imparting Hollings' view on the changes needed in Washington. Among other things, the book recommended a dramatic decrease in the amount of campaign spending. It also attacked [[free trade]] policies as inherently destructive, suggesting that certain protectionist measures built the United States and that only a few parties actually benefited from free trade, such as large manufacturing corporations.<ref>{{cite book|title= Making Government Work|url= https://archive.org/details/makinggovernment00holl|url-access= registration|year= 2008|publisher= University of South Carolina Press|location= Columbia, S.C. |author= Hollings, Ernest with Kirk Victor}}</ref>\n\nHollings started the Hollings Scholarship in 2005. It gave over 100 undergraduates from around the country a 10-week internship with the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and a monetary scholarship for the school year.\n\nHollings helped to establish the [[Hollings Center|Hollings Center for International Dialogue]], an organization which promotes dialogue between the United States and [[Turkey]], the nations of the Middle East, North Africa, and Southwest Asia, and other countries with predominantly Muslim populations in order to open channels of communication, deepen cross-cultural understanding, expand people-to-people contacts, and generate new thinking on important international issues.\n\nHollings was also on the board of advisors as a distinguished visiting professor of Law with the [[Charleston School of Law]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charlestonlaw.edu/v.php?pg=20 |title=Board of Advisors webpage |publisher=Charleston School of Law.

A conservative [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he was also the [[Governor of South Carolina]] and the 77th [[List of lieutenant governors of South Carolina|Lieutenant Governor]] of South Carolina. He served alongside Democrat turned [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] for 36 years, making them the longest-serving Senate duo in history. At the time of his death, he was the [[List of longest-living United States Senators|oldest living former U.S. Senator]].\n\nBorn in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], Hollings graduated from [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]] in 1942 and joined a law practice in Charleston after attending the [[University of South Carolina School of Law]]. During [[World War II]], he served as an artillery officer in campaigns in [[North Africa]] and [[Europe]]. After the war, Hollings successively won election to the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]], as Lieutenant Governor, and as Governor. He sought election to the Senate in 1962 but was defeated by incumbent [[Olin D. Johnston]].\n\nJohnston died in 1965, and the following year Hollings won a special election to serve the remainder of Johnston's term. Though the Republican Party became increasingly dominant in South Carolina after 1966, Hollings remained popular and continually won re-election, becoming [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service|one of the longest-serving Senators]] in U.S. history. Hollings sought the Democratic nomination in the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 presidential election]] but dropped out of the race after the [[New Hampshire primary]]. He declined to seek re-election in 2004 and was succeeded by Republican [[Jim DeMint]].\n\n==Early life==\nHollings was born in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the son of Wilhelmine Dorothea Meyer (1888\u20131982) and Adolph Gevert Hollings, Sr. (1882\u20131940).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thetimeisnow.us/senators/southcarolina/sc_hollings.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 25, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518084927/http://www.thetimeisnow.us/senators/southcarolina/sc_hollings.htm |archivedate=May 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&dat=19820823&id=hpUiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7KkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6490,7966513 |title=Mrs. Hollings Services |date=1982-08-23 |work=The Sumter Daily Item |via=Google News Archive}}</ref> He was of German descent.<ref>{{Cite book |title=New Politics in the Old South |last=Ballantyne |first=David T. |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-61117-704-6 |jstor=j.ctv6sj8ws}}</ref> Hollings was raised at 338 President St. in the [[Hampton Park Terrace]] neighborhood from the age of 10 until he enrolled in college.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Education==\nHollings graduated from [[The Citadel (Military College)|The Citadel]] in 1942, receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree.

He also called for and achieved significant increases in teachers' salaries, bringing them closer to the regional average.

Hollings' successor as governor, [[Donald S. Russell]], resigned in order to accept appointment to the Senate seat. In the summer of 1966, Hollings defeated Russell in the Democratic primary for the remaining two years of the term. He then narrowly won the special election on November 8, 1966, against the Democrat-turned-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Marshall Parker]], and was sworn in shortly thereafter. He gained seniority on other newly elected U.S. senators who would have to wait until January 1967 to take the oath of office. In 1967, he was one of eleven senators who voted against the nomination of [[Thurgood Marshall]] to become the first black justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. The following year, Hollings won the Senate seat for his first full term when he again defeated Marshall Parker but in this instance by a much wider margin.\n\nFor thirty-six years (until January 2003), he served alongside Republican Strom Thurmond, making them the longest-serving Senate duo in the history of the United States to date. This also made Hollings the longest-serving junior senator, even though he had more seniority than all but a few of his colleagues. Thurmond and Hollings generally had a good relationship despite their sometimes sharp philosophical differences, and frequently collaborated on legislation and projects to benefit South Carolina. Their combined seniority gave South Carolina clout in national politics well beyond its relatively small population. Only Thurmond, [[Robert Byrd]], [[Ted Kennedy]], [[Daniel Inouye]], [[Carl Hayden]], [[John Stennis]], [[Ted Stevens]], [[Patrick Leahy|Pat Leahy]], [[Orrin Hatch]], and [[Thad Cochran]] have served longer in the Senate than did Hollings.\n\nIn 1970, Hollings authored ''The Case Against Hunger: A Demand for a National Policy'', acknowledging the Reverend I.D. Newman and Sister Mary Anthony for opening his eyes to the despair caused by hunger and helping him realize that he must do something about it.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Case Against Hunger: A Demand for a National Policy|year= 1970|publisher= Cowles Book Company, Inc.|location= New York|isbn= 0402126114|author= Hollings, Ernest|url= https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_k8q0}}</ref> Hollings made headlines the year before when he toured poverty-stricken areas of South Carolina, often referred to as his \"Hunger Tours.\" He was accused of drawing unwanted attention to South Carolina when other states \u2014 North and South \u2014 also faced extreme poverty. Hollings knew South Carolina was not alone in its struggle and thought that if any politician was going to investigate hunger in South Carolina, it was going to at least be a South Carolinian. After a tour of an East Charleston slum, he said, \"I don't want [[George W. Romney|Romney]] and [[Ted Kennedy|Kennedy]] coming here to look at my slums. As a matter of fact when I get caught up with my work, I think I may go look at the slums of Boston.\"<ref>Robertson, Glenn (January 11, 1968). \"Hollings 'Angered' by Tour of Slums.\" Charleston, S.C.: ''Evening Post''.</ref> For his efforts, Hollings was also accused of \"scheming for the Negro vote.\" Hollings, who had seen plenty of white hunger and poverty and slums on his tours, responded, \"You just don't make political points on hunger. The poor aren't registered to vote and they won't vote.\"<ref>Pyatt, \"The Beginning of a Rennaissance {{sic}} in Dixie?\".</ref> In February 1969, however, Hollings testified as to what he had seen on his fact-finding tours in front of the [[Senate Select Committee on Hunger and Human Needs]]. Charleston's ''News and Courier'' (now ''[[The Post and Courier]]'') reported that \"Senators, members of the press corps and visitors packed in the hearing room watched and listened in disbelief as Hollings detailed dozens of tragically poignant scenes of human suffering in his state.\"<ref name=Pyatt>{{cite news |author= Pyatt, Rudolph|date= February 23, 1969|title= The Beginning of a Rennaissance {{sic}} in Dixie|newspaper= News and Courier|location= Charleston, S.C.}}</ref> Hollings recommended to the committee that free [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] be distributed to the most needy, and just over a day later, Senator [[George McGovern]] announced that free food stamps would be distributed in South Carolina as part of a national pilot program for feeding the hungry.<ref name=Pyatt/>\n\nHollings and his first wife separated in 1970 and divorced in 1971. Their children lived with their mother, and Hollings never discussed the reason for the divorce. Later that year, he married Rita Liddy \"Peatsy\" Hollings (born 1935), who was 13 years his junior.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.postandcourier.com/news/peatsy-hollings-wife-of-former-sen-fritz-hollings-dies-at/article_03100699-9166-58cf-8fda-cb262738cd17.html|title=Peatsy Hollings, wife of former Sen.

Hollings said President Nixon had led the U.S. down a \"clamorous road of drift and division\" and criticized the \"ranting rhetoric\" of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]]. Hollings attributed the principal blame for the disunity of the U.S. on special interest groups and \"impatient minority blocs\" that had shouted \"non negotiable demands\". Hollings linked former President Johnson and President Nixon with having both \"attacked the politics of the problem rather than the problems themselves.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/26/archives/hollings-attacks-nixon-on-discord-he-says-the-administration-feeds.html|title=HOLLINGS ATTACKS NIXON ON DISCORD|date=September 26, 1970|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1971, Hollings introduced Ted Kennedy in Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of his remarks calling for an end to the [[Vietnam War]]. Hollings disclosed that Kennedy had sought his advice on how to answer reporters' questions regarding a possible presidential campaign and that Kennedy was of the belief that his visit would spark speculation on the part of reporters about a campaign regardless of what he said.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/01/archives/kennedy-in-visit-to-carolina-cites-calhoun-but-not-sherman.html|title=Kennedy, in Visit to Carolina, Cites Calhoun But Not\u2010Sherman|date=March 1, 1971|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1971, Hollings announced his opposition to the nomination of [[Earl Butz]] for [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/11/27/archives/kansas-republican-joins-foes-of-butz.html|title=KANSAS REPUBLICAN JOINS FOES OF BUTZ|date=November 27, 1971|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Hollings and Republican [[William Saxbe]] sponsored a resolution bestowing early United States recognition on [[Bangladesh]] as the Nixon administration sought a policy of delaying recognition until \"there were commensurate diplomatic benefits to the United States.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/03/archives/kennedy-fears-new-pakistan-arms-aid.html|title=Kennedy Fears New Pakistan Arms Aid|first=Benjamin|last=Welles|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Hollings was one of five Democrats to vote against the nomination of [[F.

Hollings was one of four members of the committee to oppose Vance's request during the latter's appearance before the subcommittee and Hollings later sent a letter to Vance declining the request. Hollings explained that \"a smooth transition to unofficial relations may be threatened\" in the event of funds not being transferred to the American Institute before the American Embassy in Taiwan ceased its function by its designated date of March 1. Hollings' opposition was considered unusual given that most requests were approved and State Department officials publicly stated their wishes for Hollings and his colleagues to drop their opposition in the face of Taiwan's reluctant agreement to setting up \"nongovernmental body in Washington\" that would serve as the counterpart to the American Institute in Taipei.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/13/archives/senate-panel-balks-at-letting-us-shift-funds-to-new-office-in.html|title=Senate Panel Balks at Letting U.S. Shift Funds to New Office in Taipei|first=Bernard|last=Gwertzman|date=February 13, 1979|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Hollings opposed legislation enabling the United States to admit 1,000 additional Indochinese refugees a month amid increased concern in both the Carter administration and Congress regarding moves by the Vietnamese government to force ethnic Chinese to flee the country at a rate of about 60,000 a month.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/26/archives/senate-votes-funds-for-more-refugees-growing-concern-for-refugees.html|title=Senate Votes Funds for More Refugees|date=June 26, 1979|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1979, Hollings announced his opposition to the United States-Soviet Union nuclear arms treaty, saying the treaty should be defeated unless amended with a reduction of Soviet military power. His proposal was believed to stir Russian disapproval of the treaty if implemented. Hollings also made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the [[Senate Budget Committee]] to add $2.6 billion for a recommendation for military spending that would be included in Congress's second concurrent resolution on the budget.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/04/archives/senators-appeal-to-carter-to-resist-linking-arms-treaty-and.html|title=Senators Appeal to Carter to Resist Linking Arms Treaty and Spending|date=August 4, 1979|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\n====Presidential candidate====\nHollings unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for [[President of the United States]] in [[1984 United States presidential election|the presidential election of 1984]]. Hollings' wit and experience, as well as his call for a [[budget freeze]], won him some positive attention, but his relatively conservative record alienated liberal Democrats, and he was never really noticed in a field dominated by [[Walter Mondale]], [[John Glenn]] and [[Gary Hart]]. Hollings dropped out two days after losing badly in the [[New Hampshire Primary]], and endorsed Hart a week later. His disdain for his competitors sometimes showed. He notably referred to Mondale as a \"lapdog\" and to former Astronaut Glenn as a \"[[Sky King]]\" who was \"confused in his capsule.\"<ref name = \"The Citadel Archives: Hollings, Ernest, 1922\">{{cite web | url = http://www3.citadel.edu/archivesguide/index.php/HOLLINGS,_ERNEST,_1922 | title = The Citadel Archives: Hollings, Ernest, 1922}}</ref>\n\n====Later Senate career====\nOn March 24, 1981, Hollings introduced legislation that if passed would restore the military draft with limited deferments and exemptions and stipulating that men aged 18 to 22 years old would be required to spend nine months of active service for basic training that potentially would precede reserve duty. Hollings' proposal granted deferments \"to people on active duty, in the reserves or in advanced [[Reserve Officers Training Corps]] study; surviving sons or brothers of those killed in war or missing in action; conscientious objectors and ministers; doctors and others in vital health professions, and judges of courts of record and elected officials.\" Hollings stated that recruiting for the armed forces had fallen short of requirements by an estimated 23,000 people in 1979 and that he believed the draft applying to women \"should be across the board\" due to the issue continuing to be debated between the public and the courts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/25/us/bill-introduced-in-senate-to-reinstate-the-draft.html|title=Bill Introduced in Senate To Reinstate the Draft|date=March 25, 1981|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Hollings apologized to fellow Democrat [[Howard Metzenbaum]] after Hollings referred to him as the \"senator from [[B'nai B'rith]]\" on the floor. Metzenbaum, who was Jewish, raised a [[Question of privilege|point of personal privilege]] and Hollings's remarks were stricken from the record.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/16/us/a-senator-s-cannibal-joke-angers-blacks.html|title=A Senator's Cannibal 'Joke' Angers Blacks|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 16, 1993|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1985, the Senate Budget Committee approved a proposal sponsored by Hollings freezing military spending by not allowing any growth above inflation in fiscal year 1986 and bestowing three percent hikes in the following two years, Hollings after the vote saying that a pattern had been set for similar action on other budget items and predicted that the Budget Committee would also go against another Reagan administration supported position by freezing Social Security cost of living increases.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/biddeford-journal-tribune-mar-06-1985-p-4/|title=Budget freezers extend the chill|date=March 6, 1985|publisher=Journal Tribune}}</ref>\n\nOn May 1, 1985, the [[Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation]] rejected an amendment to a bill reauthorizing the [[Federal Communications Commission]] prohibiting public television stations from swapping channels with commercial stations, Hollings afterward stating that the vote was \"a tragic abdication by Congress of its over 60-year-old responsibility to protect the public's interest in broadcasting.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/01/arts/senate-panel-rejects-ban-on-channel-swaps.html|title=SENATE PANEL REJECTS BAN ON CHANNEL SWAPS|date=May 1, 1985|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1985, Hollings and Republicans [[Phil Gramm]] and [[Warren Rudman]] sponsored an amendment to establish a budget deficit ceiling that would decline to zero by 1991 that was attached to a bill raising the [[debt limit]] of the federal government by more than $250 billion. The amendment was approved by a vote of 75 to 24 and was stated as a possible prelude to a balanced budget in five years without a tax increase by [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[James Baker]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/14/us/treasury-head-defends-plan-for-ending-deficit.html|title=Treasury Head Defends Plan for Ending Deficit|date=October 14, 1985|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 Presidential primaries]], Hollings endorsed [[Jesse Jackson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55210|title=Our Campaigns - US President - D Primaries Race - Feb 01, 1988|website=www.ourcampaigns.com}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1989, Hollings announced from his Washington office that he would request the [[General Accounting Office]] investigate efforts by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] to provide timely assistance and funds to victims of [[Hurricane Hugo]] the previous month. Hollings charged FEMA with \"stonewalling, fretting and filling out forms\" and called on the federal government to become more active in trying to relieve areas devastated by Hurricane Hugo.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/10/03/Hollings-calls-for-FEMA-investigation/4897623390400/|title=Hollings calls for FEMA investigation|date=October 3, 1989|publisher=UPI}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1990, Hollings planned the compiling of the Senate Budget Committee to vote on a cut in [[Social Security tax]]es, an idea initially forwarded at the end of the previous year by fellow Democratic senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] as a way of making Congress address what he considered to be a serious problem in the management of the Social Security trust funds. Hollings sought a revenue figure which reflected the $36 billion tax cut through a rollback of Social Security payroll taxes increases that were scheduled to take effect January 1 and confirmed he would ask his colleagues on the budget committee to remove the trust funds from the budget deficit calculation and vote on the 1991 budget including a $300 billion deficit. Hollings' plan included a 5 percent [[value-added tax]] on goods and services in addition to a 10 percent oil import fee as well as an increase in the top income tax rate to 33 percent among wealthiest taxpayers. The goal was considered an uphill battle where Hollings could be outmaneuvered in committee with parliamentary tactics that would result in the precluding of a straight up-or-down vote on the Social Security tax cut. Acknowledging this, Hollings said, \"They may try to block me. But we will find a bill by God to cut Social Security taxes. There will be a vote.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/24/us/decision-is-urged-on-social-security.html|title=DECISION IS URGED ON SOCIAL SECURITY|date=April 24, 1990|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1991, Hollings joined most Democratic senators in voting against a resolution authorizing war against Iraq.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/01/12/Senate-vote-authorizing-military-force-against-Iraq/3439806032531/|title=Senate vote authorizing military force against Iraq|date=January 12, 1991|publisher=UPI}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Hollings told reporters that he attended international summits because, \"Everybody likes to go to [[Geneva]]. I used to do it for the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea conferences]] and you'd find those potentates from down in [[Africa]], you know, rather than eating each other, they'd just come up and get a good square meal in Geneva.\"<ref name=nyt/>  Hollings had previously caused controversy when responding to [[Yoshio Sakurauchi]]'s commentary that Americans are lazy and illiterate.  Hollings replied, \"You should draw a mushroom cloud and put underneath it, 'Made in America by lazy and illiterate Americans and tested in Japan'.\"<ref name=nyt/>\n\nHollings remained very popular in South Carolina over the years, even as the state became increasingly friendly to Republicans at the national level. In his first three bids for a full term, he never dropped below 60 percent of the vote. In [[United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1992|the 1992 election]], however, he faced an unexpectedly close race against former Congressman [[Tommy Hartnett]] in what was otherwise a very good year for Democrats nationally. Hartnett had represented the Charleston area in Congress from 1981 to 1987, thus making him Hollings' congressman. His appeal in the [[Lowcountry]] \u2013 traditionally a swing region at the state level \u2013 enabled him to hold Hollings to only 50 percent of the vote.\n\nIn his last [[United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1998|Senate race in 1998]], Hollings faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] congressman [[Bob Inglis]]. One of the more heated moments of the race was a newspaper interview in which Hollings referred to Inglis as a \"goddamn skunk\". Hollings was re-elected 52%\u201345%.\n\nOn January 7, 2003, Hollings introduced the controversial Universal National Service Act of 2006, which would require all men and women aged 18\u201326 (with some exceptions) to perform a year of military service.\n\n[[Image:Fritz Hollings press photo, color.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Senator Ernest Hollings]]\nOn August 4, 2003, he announced that he would not run for re-election in November 2004. Republican [[Jim DeMint]] succeeded him.\n\nAs a senator, Hollings supported legislation in the interests of the established media distribution industry (such as the proposed \"[[Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act]]\"). His hard-line support of various [[client-side]] computer restrictions such as [[Digital rights management|DRM]] and [[Trusted computing]] led the [[Fritz chip]] (a microchip that enforces such restrictions) to be nicknamed after him. Hollings also sponsored the [[Online Personal Privacy Act]].<ref>(S. 2201)</ref>\n\nIn his later career, Hollings was moderate politically but was supportive of many [[civil rights]] bills. He voted for re-authorizing the [[Voting Rights Act]] in 1982. However, in 1967 he was one of the 11 senators who voted against the confirmation of [[Thurgood Marshall]], the first black [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] justice.<ref>https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/240_1967.pdf</ref> Hollings later voted in favor of the failed nomination of [[Robert Bork]] and also for the successful nomination of [[Clarence Thomas]].\n\nOn fiscal issues, he was generally conservative, and was one of the primary sponsors of the [[Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act]], an attempt to enforce limits on government spending.\n\nHollings and [[Howell Heflin]] of [[Alabama]] were the only two Democratic senators to vote against the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&session=1&vote=00011|title=U.S. Senate: U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 103rd Congress - 1st Session|website=www.senate.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Post Senatorial life and death==\n[[Image:Hollings Judicial Center in Charleston, SC IMG 4576.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The [[J.

His opinion editorials were also published every week in EconomyInCrisis.org, an independent protectionist news blog. In 2008, [[the University of South Carolina Press]] published ''Making Government Work'', a book authored by Hollings with Washington, D.C., journalist Kirk Victor, imparting Hollings' view on the changes needed in Washington. Among other things, the book recommended a dramatic decrease in the amount of campaign spending. It also attacked [[free trade]] policies as inherently destructive, suggesting that certain protectionist measures built the United States and that only a few parties actually benefited from free trade, such as large manufacturing corporations.<ref>{{cite book|title= Making Government Work|url= https://archive.org/details/makinggovernment00holl|url-access= registration|year= 2008|publisher= University of South Carolina Press|location= Columbia, S.C. |author= Hollings, Ernest with Kirk Victor}}</ref>\n\nHollings started the Hollings Scholarship in 2005. It gave over 100 undergraduates from around the country a 10-week internship with the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and a monetary scholarship for the school year.\n\nHollings helped to establish the [[Hollings Center|Hollings Center for International Dialogue]], an organization which promotes dialogue between the United States and [[Turkey]], the nations of the Middle East, North Africa, and Southwest Asia, and other countries with predominantly Muslim populations in order to open channels of communication, deepen cross-cultural understanding, expand people-to-people contacts, and generate new thinking on important international issues.\n\nHollings was also on the board of advisors as a distinguished visiting professor of Law with the [[Charleston School of Law]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charlestonlaw.edu/v.php?pg=20 |title=Board of Advisors webpage |publisher=Charleston School of Law.

The decision to commence NIV, usually in the emergency department, depends on the initial response to medication ([[Bronchodilator|bronchodilators]] given by [[nebulizer]]) and the results of [[arterial blood gas test]]<nowiki/>s. If after medical therapy the lungs remain unable to clear [[carbon dioxide]] from the bloodstream ([[respiratory acidosis]]), NIV may be indicated. Many people with COPD have chronically elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels with metabolic compensation, but NIV is only indicated if the CO<sub>2</sub> is acutely increased to the point that the acidity levels of the blood are increased (pH<7.35).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Rochwerg|first=Bram|last2=Brochard|first2=Laurent|last3=Elliott|first3=Mark W.|last4=Hess|first4=Dean|last5=Hill|first5=Nicholas S.|last6=Nava|first6=Stefano|last7=Navalesi|first7=Paolo|last8=Antonelli|first8=Massimo|last9=Brozek|first9=Jan|date=August 2017|title=Official ERS/ATS clinical practice guidelines: noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure|url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/lookup/doi/10.1183/13993003.02426-2016|journal=European Respiratory Journal|language=en|volume=50|issue=2|pages=1602426|doi=10.1183/13993003.02426-2016|via=}}</ref> There is no level of acidity above which NIV cannot be started, but more severe acidosis carries a higher risk that NIV alone is not effective and that [[mechanical ventilation]] will be required instead.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n=== Other causes of AHRF ===\n[[Bronchiectasis]] may lead to [[hypercapnia|acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF)]], and NIV may be used similarly as for COPD.<ref name=\"Davidson\" /> This is particularly the case where the underlying cause is [[cystic fibrosis]].<ref name=\"Davidson\" /> Cystic fibrosis also causes high volumes of [[sputum]] (phlegm) which may require specialised physiotherapy assistance and sometimes the insertion of a [[tracheostomy|mini-tracheostomy]] to clear this.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />\n\nIn people with chest wall deformity or neuromuscular disease, NIV may be commenced if the CO<sub>2</sub> level is elevated even if it has not yet caused acidosis.<ref name=\"Davidson\" /> In neuromuscular disease, a breathing measurement known as the [[vital capacity]] is used to determine a need for breathing support.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />\n\n[[Obesity hypoventilation syndrome]] (OHS) may cause acute hypercapnic respiratory failure.

Entering the best-of-three challenge series, the Thistles were younger and quicker than Ottawa; only one player on the Thistles was over the age of 20.  Any chance that those factors could have helped the team was negated by soft ice conditions.

Her mother worked for [[Philippe Curtius]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland, who was a physician skilled in wax modeling. Curtius taught Tussaud the art of wax modelling beginning when she was a child. He moved to Paris and took his young apprentice, then only 6 years old, with him.<ref name=denton>{{cite web|url=https://thelegendsoflondon.wordpress.com/2012/05/26/the-baker-street-bazaar/|title=The Baker Street Bazaar|date=26 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nGrosholtz created her first [[wax sculpture]] in 1777 of [[Voltaire]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Du Plessis |first=Amelia |title=England\u2014Madame Tussauds] |url=http://www.england.org.za/madame-tussauds.php |publisher=Informational site about England |accessdate=12 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213062041/http://www.england.org.za/madame-tussauds.php |archivedate=13 December 2011}}</ref> At the age of 17, she became the art tutor to Madame Elizabeth, the sister of King [[Louis XVI]] of France, at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. During the [[French Revolution]], she was imprisoned for three months and awaiting execution, but was released after the intervention of an influential friend.<ref name=denton/> Other famous people whom she modelled included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].

For the next 33 years she travelled around Europe with a touring show from the collection. She married Francois Tussaud in 1795 and took his surname. She renamed her show as Madame Tussaud's. In 1802, she accepted an invitation from [[Paul Philidor]], a [[lantern]] and [[phantasmagoria]] pioneer, to exhibit her work alongside his show at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], London. She did not fare particularly well financially, with Philidor taking half of her profits.\n\nShe was unable to return to France because of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], so she traveled throughout [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]] exhibiting her collection. From 1831, she took a series of short leases on the upper floor of \"Baker Street Bazaar\" (on the west side of [[Baker Street]], Dorset Street, and King Street).<ref>Pilbeam (2006) pp. 102\u2013106</ref> This site was later featured in the [[Druce-Portland case]] sequence of trials of 1898\u20131907.

Madame Tussauds.com.</ref> One of the main attractions of her museum was the [[Chamber of Horrors (Madame Tussauds)|Chamber of Horrors]]. The name is often credited to a contributor to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1845, but Tussaud appears to have originated it herself, using it in advertising as early as 1843.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Berridge\n|first=Kate...But now British actress Emma Watson is already to set and appear here...\n|title=Madame Tussaud: A life in wax\n|location=New York\n|publisher=HarperCollins\n|year=2006\n|isbn=978-0-06-052847-8\n|url=https://archive.org/details/madametussaud00kate\n}}</ref>\n\nThis part of the exhibition included victims of the French Revolution and newly created figures of murderers and other criminals. Other famous people were added, including [[Lord Nelson]] and Sir [[Walter Scott]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nSome sculptures still exist that were made by Marie Tussaud herself. The gallery originally contained some 400 different figures, but fire damage in 1925, coupled with [[The Blitz|German bombs in 1941]], severely damaged most of such older models. The casts themselves have survived, allowing the historical waxworks to be remade, and these can be seen in the museum's history exhibit. The oldest figure on display is that of [[Madame du Barry]], the work of Curtius from 1765 and part of the waxworks left to Grosholtz at his death. Other faces from the time of Tussaud include [[Robespierre]] and [[George III of England|George III]]. In 1842, she made a [[self-portrait]], which is now on display at the entrance of her museum. She died in her sleep on 16 April 1850.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Bernard Tussaud befejezi Lady Alice Scott \u00e9s a Gloucesteri herceg viasszobr\u00e1t \u2013 London, 1935.10.16.tif|thumb|left|200px|Bernard Tussaud finishes the wax figure of [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester|Lady Alice Scott]] and the [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]] \u2013 1935.10.16]]\n\nBy 1883, the restricted space and rising cost of the Baker Street site prompted her grandson Joseph Randall to commission construction of a building at the museum's current location on [[Marylebone Road]]. The new exhibition galleries were opened on 14 July 1884 and were a great success.<ref>Pilbeam, ''ibid''. pp. 166, 168\u20139.</ref> But Randall had bought out his cousin Louisa's half share in the business in 1881, and that plus the building costs resulted in his having too little capital. He formed a limited company in 1888 to attract fresh capital but it had to be dissolved after disagreements between the family shareholders. In February 1889 Tussaud's was sold to a group of businessmen, led by Edwin Josiah Poyser.<ref>Pilbeam, ''ibid''. p. 170.</ref>\n\nThe first wax sculpture of a young [[Winston Churchill]] was made in 1908; a total of ten have been made since.<ref>Pamela Pilbeam ''Madame Tussaud: And the History of Waxworks''.

Until 2010 it incorporated the [[London Planetarium]] in its west wing. A large animated [[dark ride]], ''The Spirit of London'', opened in 1993. Today's wax figures at Tussauds include historical and royal figures, film stars, sports stars, and famous murderers. It has been known since 2007 as \"Madame Tussauds\" museums (no apostrophe).\n\nIn July 2008, Madame Tussauds' Berlin branch became embroiled in controversy when a 41-year-old German man brushed past two guards and decapitated a wax figure depicting [[Adolf Hitler]]. This was believed to be an act of protest against showing the ruthless dictator alongside sports heroes, movie stars, and other historical figures. The statue has since been repaired, and the perpetrator has admitted that he attacked the statue to win a bet.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=211\n |title       = Adolf Hitler returns to Berlin museum after beheading\n |publisher   = meeja.com.au\n |date        = 14 September 2008\n |accessdate  = 14 September 2008\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080919112006/http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=211\n |archivedate = 19 September 2008\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The original model of Hitler was unveiled in Madame Tussauds London in April 1933; it was frequently vandalised and a 1936 replacement had to be carefully guarded.<ref>Pilbeam, ''ibid''. p. 199.</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|title = Madame Tussauds to repair beheaded Hitler\n|agency = Associated Press\n|date = 7 July 2008\n|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25540602\n|accessdate = 7 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Man rips head from Hitler wax figure |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN0547926220080705?feedType=RSS&feedName=oddlyEnoughNews |agency=[[Reuters]] |first=Paul |last=Carrel |date=5 July 2008}}</ref> In January 2016, the statue of Adolf Hitler was removed from the London museum in response to an open letter sent by a staff writer of ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'', followed by significant support for its removal from social media.<ref name=jjmadameremoved>{{cite news|last1=Gur-Arieh|first1=Noga|title=Madame Tussauds Museum in London Removed Hitler Figure|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/israelife/item/madame_tussauds_museum_in_london_removed_hitler_figure|accessdate=10 January 2016|work=The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|date=6 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first Madame Tussauds in India opened in New Delhi on 1 December 2017.

For the next 33 years she travelled around Europe with a touring show from the collection. She married Francois Tussaud in 1795 and took his surname. She renamed her show as Madame Tussaud's. In 1802, she accepted an invitation from [[Paul Philidor]], a [[lantern]] and [[phantasmagoria]] pioneer, to exhibit her work alongside his show at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], London. She did not fare particularly well financially, with Philidor taking half of her profits.\n\nShe was unable to return to France because of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], so she traveled throughout [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]] exhibiting her collection. From 1831, she took a series of short leases on the upper floor of \"Baker Street Bazaar\" (on the west side of [[Baker Street]], Dorset Street, and King Street).<ref>Pilbeam (2006) pp. 102\u2013106</ref> This site was later featured in the [[Druce-Portland case]] sequence of trials of 1898\u20131907.

Madame Tussauds.com.</ref> One of the main attractions of her museum was the [[Chamber of Horrors (Madame Tussauds)|Chamber of Horrors]]. The name is often credited to a contributor to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1845, but Tussaud appears to have originated it herself, using it in advertising as early as 1843.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Berridge\n|first=Kate...But now British actress Emma Watson is already to set and appear here...\n|title=Madame Tussaud: A life in wax\n|location=New York\n|publisher=HarperCollins\n|year=2006\n|isbn=978-0-06-052847-8\n|url=https://archive.org/details/madametussaud00kate\n}}</ref>\n\nThis part of the exhibition included victims of the French Revolution and newly created figures of murderers and other criminals. Other famous people were added, including [[Lord Nelson]] and Sir [[Walter Scott]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nSome sculptures still exist that were made by Marie Tussaud herself. The gallery originally contained some 400 different figures, but fire damage in 1925, coupled with [[The Blitz|German bombs in 1941]], severely damaged most of such older models. The casts themselves have survived, allowing the historical waxworks to be remade, and these can be seen in the museum's history exhibit. The oldest figure on display is that of [[Madame du Barry]], the work of Curtius from 1765 and part of the waxworks left to Grosholtz at his death. Other faces from the time of Tussaud include [[Robespierre]] and [[George III of England|George III]]. In 1842, she made a [[self-portrait]], which is now on display at the entrance of her museum. She died in her sleep on 16 April 1850.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Bernard Tussaud befejezi Lady Alice Scott \u00e9s a Gloucesteri herceg viasszobr\u00e1t \u2013 London, 1935.10.16.tif|thumb|left|200px|Bernard Tussaud finishes the wax figure of [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester|Lady Alice Scott]] and the [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]] \u2013 1935.10.16]]\n\nBy 1883, the restricted space and rising cost of the Baker Street site prompted her grandson Joseph Randall to commission construction of a building at the museum's current location on [[Marylebone Road]].

Today's wax figures at Tussauds include historical and royal figures, film stars, sports stars, and famous murderers. It has been known since 2007 as \"Madame Tussauds\" museums (no apostrophe).\n\nIn July 2008, Madame Tussauds' Berlin branch became embroiled in controversy when a 41-year-old German man brushed past two guards and decapitated a wax figure depicting [[Adolf Hitler]]. This was believed to be an act of protest against showing the ruthless dictator alongside sports heroes, movie stars, and other historical figures.
