Founded in 1984 by French engineers Claude Poiraud and G\u00e9rard Godfroy as ''MVS (Manufacture de Voitures de Sport)'', the company's purpose was to compete in the \"[[Grand Tourer|Grand Tourisme]]\" market. This was only the most recent post-war attempt at building a sporty luxury car in France, following in the footsteps of [[Facel Vega]], [[Monica (automobile)|Monica]], and [[Ligier]].<ref name=\"Retroviseur302\">{{cite journal | journal = R\u00e9troviseur | title = Requiem pour un nom | trans-title = Requiem for a name | language = French | last = Decker | first = Jean-Paul | page = 70 | ref = XCrv |date= July 2014 | number = 302 | publisher = \u00c9ditions LVA | location = Fontainebleu, France | issn = 0992-5007 }}</ref> As with its predecessors, Venturi was immediately faced with many challenges ranging from an unknown name to its under-capitalized and under-staffed state. Venturi did nonetheless manage to continue in production for nearly sixteen years, declaring bankruptcy in 2000. The same year, Monegasque [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] purchased Venturi, and decided to focus on electric-powered engines. This change of direction led to the limited-production [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]], the first electric sports car in the world. Following the public's enthusiasm for this first electric model, the brand developed 5 other innovative concept cars.\n\nThe first team to commit to the [[Formula E|Formula E World Championship]], Venturi competes under the name of [[Venturi Racing|ROKiT Venturi Racing]] with its drivers [[Felipe Massa]] and [[Edoardo Mortara]].\n\nToday, Venturi is specialised in the development of high performance electric vehicles destined to break records or to operate in extreme conditions. Through its [[Venturi Automobiles#Venturi Global Challenges|Venturi Global Challenges,]] Venturi aims at demonstrating the efficiency and durability of electric vehicles. \n\n== History ==\n\n=== From 1984 to 2000 ===\n[[Image:Venturi 300 Atlantique 3.4 front.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venturi Atlantique|Venturi 300 Atlantique]]]]\nThe first Venturi came out in 1984, created by Claude Poiraud and G\u00e9rard Godfroy, two former engineers at [[Heuliez]]. The goal was to present the only \"[[grand tourer|Grand Tourisme]]\" French car capable of competing with the English [[Aston Martin]], the Italian [[Ferrari]], and the German [[Porsche]]. The first car shown had a [[Volkswagen Golf]] GTi engine and the name was originally spelled \"Ventury\", with a \"y\" at the end. In 1985, the car was shown with a {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Peugeot 505]] Turbo engine, but by the 1986 [[Paris Motor Show]] it had reached its definitive form with the [[PRV engine|PRV V6]] engine. Production began in 1987, with five cars built in the first year with production increasing in the subsequent years. The headquarters of the company was located in [[Cou\u00ebron]], [[Pays de Loire]], where almost 750 cars were produced in the forthcoming 20 years.\n\n[[File:Venturi 260 LM, \u00be front.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 260 LM]]\nFrom 1987 to the mid-1990s, they built mid-engined [[coup\u00e9s]] and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadsters]] with [[turbocharged]] [[PRV engine]]s and [[Renault]] [[gearboxes]]. Engine power ranged from {{convert|200|to|260|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the then offered MVS Venturi Coup\u00e9 and Transcup series. The naturally aspirated Venturi 160 used the catalyzed 2849&nbsp;cc version of the PRV V6; this was meant to be sold in Japan and was therefore also available with an automatic transmsission. Only a handful were built. There was also the {{convert|185|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} Venturi 180, mainly developed for Italy, which used the turbocharged 1995-cc inline-four [[Douvrin engine]] from the [[Renault 21#Turbo|Renault 21 Turbo]].\n\nVenturi was also briefly involved with the [[Larrousse]] [[Formula One]] team. The team's 1992 car, which bore the Venturi name, was designed and built by Venturi Larousse UK, a British company formerly known as Fomet 1, which had previously designed the 1991 [[Fondmetal]] Formula One cars.<ref>{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Autocourse: the World's Leading Grand Prix Annual 1992-93 | publisher = Motorbooks Intl | page=83 | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-905138-96-1 }}</ref>\n[[File:Venturi 400GT S\u00e9rie 2 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi 400 GT rear view]]\n[[File:Venturi_400_GT_Red.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 400 GT]]\nThe Venturi 400 GT remains one of the highest performing French cars ever produced, and it is in fact the very first car in the world to have standard carbon brakes.<ref name=collector04>{{cite web | url = http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/400gt.php | title = Guide d'achat: Venturi 400-GT | trans-title = Buyers' Guide | publisher = l'Automobile Sportive | first = Nicolas | last = Liszewski | language = French | date = 2004-12-23 |accessdate = 7 March 2018}}</ref> True to that claim, the Atlantique 400 GT with a {{cvt|2975|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Multi-valve#Four-valve cylinder head|4 valve]]s per cylinder [[twin-turbo]] [[V6 engine]] rated at {{convert|300|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and {{convert|520|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4500&nbsp;rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] with a [[compression ratio]] of 7.3:1, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1995-venturi-400gt/|website=supercars.net|title=1995 Venturi 400GT|editor=NIck D|date=December 20, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> delivered excellent performance to put it on par with Ferraris of the early 90s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The 400 GT could hit {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and {{convert|291|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} top speed, while the [[Venturi Atlantique#Atlantique 300 Biturbo|Atlantique 300 Biturbo]] with a {{convert|310|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} V6 could accelerate from 0-{{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and could reach a top speed of {{convert|275|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/atlantique300.php|website=automobile-sportive.com|title=VENTURI ATLANTIQUE-300 (1996 - 2000)|editor=S\u00e9bastien Dupuis|language=fr-fr|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Venturi Transcup 210.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi Transcup 210]]\nA limited-edition 400 GTR was built to satisfy the [[homologation]] requirements to compete [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. High-level competition has also brought fame to the brand. St\u00e9phane Ratel, who would later found the [[FIA GT Championship]], was at the origin of the Venturi Gentlemen Drivers Trophy, which gathered an impressive array of 75 drivers. Venturi has also won fame through its brilliant performances in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], particularly in 1993 with [[Christophe Dechavanne]] and [[Jacques Laffite]] on Venturi Jaccadi team, and in 1995 with [[Paul Belmondo]] racing on the 600 SLM.\n\nHowever, it was in the [[BPR Global GT Series]] races that Venturi established its pedigree defeating Porsche and Ferrari on several occasions. In 1994 in [[Dijon-Prenois]], with Fert\u00e9 and Neugarten on the 600 LM Jaccadi, at the 1000&nbsp;km of Paris with [[Henri Pescarolo]] and Jean-Claude Basso on the 600 LM, and finally at the 4 Hours Spa race, once again with Michel Fert\u00e9 and Michel Neugarten.\n\n=== From 2000 to the present day ===\n\n[[Image:Stand Venturi Mondial 2006.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Venturi F\u00e9tish]] at the 2006 [[Paris Motor Show]]]]\n\nIn 2000, the [[Monaco|Monegasque]] millionaire [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] bought Venturi and decided to focus on electric-powered engines.<ref>https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/made-in-monaco/made-in-monaco-venturi-automobiles-experts-in-the-most-advanced-technologies/</ref> This led to the creation of the [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]] model, the first true electric sports car, powered by next-generation lithium-ion batteries. Its design, technology and level of performance left their mark and paved the way for other electric Venturis such as the Volage, an electric concept [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] car with 8 [[Active Wheel]] [[in-wheel motor]]s from French tire giant [[Michelin]], or the America, an electric SUV.\n\nIn December 2009, Venturi announced its acquisition of French motorcycle manufacturer [[Voxan]], allowing the firm to enter the motorcycle market.\n\n== Venturi Global Challenges ==\nVenturi has launched a series of technological and human challenges aimed at demonstrating the reliability and efficiency of electric vehicles in extreme conditions. Through these Global Challenges, the manufacturer is testing the technologies it develops in extraordinary conditions: excessive speeds, extreme weather conditions, difficult terrain in the most remote regions of the planet... As part of these challenges, Venturi has obtained several records and world firsts since 2009.\n\n=== Mission 01: ''Jamais contente'' ===\n[[File:Buckeye Bullet 3 side view.jpg|thumb|VBB-3]]\nMission 01: Jamais Contente is a program launched in 2009 in partnership with the [[Ohio State University]]'s Center for Automotive Research (CAR). It aims to set electric vehicle speed records on the legendary [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in Utah. The Venturi Buckeye Bullet is the heir to the [[La Jamais Contente|Jamais Contente]], the first ever automobile to break the symbolic 100 km/h mark in 1899. This torpedo-shaped electric car, piloted by [[Camille Jenatzy]], reached 105 km/h, setting a world record for any method of propulsion (steam or petrol) \n\nThe VBB-2, a hydrogen fuel cell-powered version, broke the 303 mph (487 km/h) mark in 2009<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218043233if_/http://argent.fia.com/web/fia-public.nsf/AA20D1FB726F2B8FC125767A00330E30/$FILE/Liste%20Records%20Cat%20A-261109.pdf|title=FIA records lists|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=2009|access-date=}}</ref>.

Departing from Shanghai on May 3, 2010, the expedition covered 14,900 km, crossing China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, the Czech Republic and Germany, finally arriving in Paris on July 13. To date, this is the longest distance covered by an unassisted electric vehicle. This performance was accomplished by Xavier Chevrin and G\u00e9raldine Gabin. The vehicle used was an electric [[Citro\u00ebn Berlingo \u00e9lectrique|Citro\u00ebn Berlingo]] \"Powered by Venturi\". Only two battery packs were added in order to increase its range to 500 km.\n\n=== Mission 03: Antarctica ===\n[[File:Venturi Antarctica vehicle.jpg|thumb|222x222px|Venturi Antarctica vehicle]]\nMission 03 consists of the development of an electric vehicle called Antarctica, which can withstand extreme temperatures as low as -50\u00b0C. The aim of the mission will be to make this vehicle available for use by the scientific community at the South Pole where drastic measures are in place to combat all types of pollution.\n\nCurrently under development, Antarctica is undergoing several test phases before being sent to the South Pole probably by the end of 2020.\n\n=== Mission 04: Africa ===\n[[File:Venturi Global Challenges, Mission 04 \"Mission Africa\".jpg|thumb|222x222px|Venturi Global Challenges, Mission 04 ]]\nMission 04 is a modern-day version of the \u201cCroisi\u00e8re Noire\u201d (''Black Cruise''), a 1924 automobile expedition that crossed the African continent from north to south. Mission 04: Africa is the first crossing of Africa in an electric vehicle with complete autonomy. The vehicle has covered 5,800 km, including 600 km of tracks.\n\nLeaving Nairobi, Kenya on 11 May 2012 in a Citro\u00ebn Berlingo \"Powered by Venturi\", Xavier Chevrin and Vivien Floris joined Johannesburg, South Africa on 18 June.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n== Motorsport ==\n\n=== Formula E ===\nVenturi was the first manufacturer to join the [[Formula E]] world championship. Created in 2013, Venturi has been present on the grid since the championship\u2019s inaugural race in 2014, contesting every E-Prix to date. \n\nIn 2015, Venturi became an FIA-approved manufacturer in Formula E, supplying full powertrain systems to Dragon Racing (2015-2016) and Mercedes-backed privateer team HWA Racelab (2018-2019). \n\nIn May 2018, the team signed a three-year deal with eleven time [[Formula One]] race winner [[Felipe Massa]]. and rehired seven time [[Macau Grand Prix|Macau World Cup]] winner [[Edoardo Mortara]] as teammate to Massa.

Founded in 1984 by French engineers Claude Poiraud and G\u00e9rard Godfroy as ''MVS (Manufacture de Voitures de Sport)'', the company's purpose was to compete in the \"[[Grand Tourer|Grand Tourisme]]\" market. This was only the most recent post-war attempt at building a sporty luxury car in France, following in the footsteps of [[Facel Vega]], [[Monica (automobile)|Monica]], and [[Ligier]].<ref name=\"Retroviseur302\">{{cite journal | journal = R\u00e9troviseur | title = Requiem pour un nom | trans-title = Requiem for a name | language = French | last = Decker | first = Jean-Paul | page = 70 | ref = XCrv |date= July 2014 | number = 302 | publisher = \u00c9ditions LVA | location = Fontainebleu, France | issn = 0992-5007 }}</ref> As with its predecessors, Venturi was immediately faced with many challenges ranging from an unknown name to its under-capitalized and under-staffed state. Venturi did nonetheless manage to continue in production for nearly sixteen years, declaring bankruptcy in 2000. The same year, Monegasque [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] purchased Venturi, and decided to focus on electric-powered engines. This change of direction led to the limited-production [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]], the first electric sports car in the world. Following the public's enthusiasm for this first electric model, the brand developed 5 other innovative concept cars.\n\nThe first team to commit to the [[Formula E|Formula E World Championship]], Venturi competes under the name of [[Venturi Racing|ROKiT Venturi Racing]] with its drivers [[Felipe Massa]] and [[Edoardo Mortara]].\n\nToday, Venturi is specialised in the development of high performance electric vehicles destined to break records or to operate in extreme conditions. Through its [[Venturi Automobiles#Venturi Global Challenges|Venturi Global Challenges,]] Venturi aims at demonstrating the efficiency and durability of electric vehicles. \n\n== History ==\n\n=== From 1984 to 2000 ===\n[[Image:Venturi 300 Atlantique 3.4 front.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venturi Atlantique|Venturi 300 Atlantique]]]]\nThe first Venturi came out in 1984, created by Claude Poiraud and G\u00e9rard Godfroy, two former engineers at [[Heuliez]]. The goal was to present the only \"[[grand tourer|Grand Tourisme]]\" French car capable of competing with the English [[Aston Martin]], the Italian [[Ferrari]], and the German [[Porsche]]. The first car shown had a [[Volkswagen Golf]] GTi engine and the name was originally spelled \"Ventury\", with a \"y\" at the end. In 1985, the car was shown with a {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Peugeot 505]] Turbo engine, but by the 1986 [[Paris Motor Show]] it had reached its definitive form with the [[PRV engine|PRV V6]] engine. Production began in 1987, with five cars built in the first year with production increasing in the subsequent years. The headquarters of the company was located in [[Cou\u00ebron]], [[Pays de Loire]], where almost 750 cars were produced in the forthcoming 20 years.\n\n[[File:Venturi 260 LM, \u00be front.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 260 LM]]\nFrom 1987 to the mid-1990s, they built mid-engined [[coup\u00e9s]] and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadsters]] with [[turbocharged]] [[PRV engine]]s and [[Renault]] [[gearboxes]]. Engine power ranged from {{convert|200|to|260|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the then offered MVS Venturi Coup\u00e9 and Transcup series. The naturally aspirated Venturi 160 used the catalyzed 2849&nbsp;cc version of the PRV V6; this was meant to be sold in Japan and was therefore also available with an automatic transmsission. Only a handful were built. There was also the {{convert|185|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} Venturi 180, mainly developed for Italy, which used the turbocharged 1995-cc inline-four [[Douvrin engine]] from the [[Renault 21#Turbo|Renault 21 Turbo]].\n\nVenturi was also briefly involved with the [[Larrousse]] [[Formula One]] team. The team's 1992 car, which bore the Venturi name, was designed and built by Venturi Larousse UK, a British company formerly known as Fomet 1, which had previously designed the 1991 [[Fondmetal]] Formula One cars.<ref>{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Autocourse: the World's Leading Grand Prix Annual 1992-93 | publisher = Motorbooks Intl | page=83 | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-905138-96-1 }}</ref>\n[[File:Venturi 400GT S\u00e9rie 2 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi 400 GT rear view]]\n[[File:Venturi_400_GT_Red.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 400 GT]]\nThe Venturi 400 GT remains one of the highest performing French cars ever produced, and it is in fact the very first car in the world to have standard carbon brakes.<ref name=collector04>{{cite web | url = http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/400gt.php | title = Guide d'achat: Venturi 400-GT | trans-title = Buyers' Guide | publisher = l'Automobile Sportive | first = Nicolas | last = Liszewski | language = French | date = 2004-12-23 |accessdate = 7 March 2018}}</ref> True to that claim, the Atlantique 400 GT with a {{cvt|2975|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Multi-valve#Four-valve cylinder head|4 valve]]s per cylinder [[twin-turbo]] [[V6 engine]] rated at {{convert|300|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and {{convert|520|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4500&nbsp;rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] with a [[compression ratio]] of 7.3:1, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1995-venturi-400gt/|website=supercars.net|title=1995 Venturi 400GT|editor=NIck D|date=December 20, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> delivered excellent performance to put it on par with Ferraris of the early 90s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The 400 GT could hit {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and {{convert|291|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} top speed, while the [[Venturi Atlantique#Atlantique 300 Biturbo|Atlantique 300 Biturbo]] with a {{convert|310|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} V6 could accelerate from 0-{{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and could reach a top speed of {{convert|275|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/atlantique300.php|website=automobile-sportive.com|title=VENTURI ATLANTIQUE-300 (1996 - 2000)|editor=S\u00e9bastien Dupuis|language=fr-fr|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Venturi Transcup 210.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi Transcup 210]]\nA limited-edition 400 GTR was built to satisfy the [[homologation]] requirements to compete [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. High-level competition has also brought fame to the brand. St\u00e9phane Ratel, who would later found the [[FIA GT Championship]], was at the origin of the Venturi Gentlemen Drivers Trophy, which gathered an impressive array of 75 drivers. Venturi has also won fame through its brilliant performances in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], particularly in 1993 with [[Christophe Dechavanne]] and [[Jacques Laffite]] on Venturi Jaccadi team, and in 1995 with [[Paul Belmondo]] racing on the 600 SLM.\n\nHowever, it was in the [[BPR Global GT Series]] races that Venturi established its pedigree defeating Porsche and Ferrari on several occasions. In 1994 in [[Dijon-Prenois]], with Fert\u00e9 and Neugarten on the 600 LM Jaccadi, at the 1000&nbsp;km of Paris with [[Henri Pescarolo]] and Jean-Claude Basso on the 600 LM, and finally at the 4 Hours Spa race, once again with Michel Fert\u00e9 and Michel Neugarten.\n\n=== From 2000 to the present day ===\n\n[[Image:Stand Venturi Mondial 2006.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Venturi F\u00e9tish]] at the 2006 [[Paris Motor Show]]]]\n\nIn 2000, the [[Monaco|Monegasque]] millionaire [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] bought Venturi and decided to focus on electric-powered engines.<ref>https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/made-in-monaco/made-in-monaco-venturi-automobiles-experts-in-the-most-advanced-technologies/</ref> This led to the creation of the [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]] model, the first true electric sports car, powered by next-generation lithium-ion batteries. Its design, technology and level of performance left their mark and paved the way for other electric Venturis such as the Volage, an electric concept [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] car with 8 [[Active Wheel]] [[in-wheel motor]]s from French tire giant [[Michelin]], or the America, an electric SUV.\n\nIn December 2009, Venturi announced its acquisition of French motorcycle manufacturer [[Voxan]], allowing the firm to enter the motorcycle market.\n\n== Venturi Global Challenges ==\nVenturi has launched a series of technological and human challenges aimed at demonstrating the reliability and efficiency of electric vehicles in extreme conditions. Through these Global Challenges, the manufacturer is testing the technologies it develops in extraordinary conditions: excessive speeds, extreme weather conditions, difficult terrain in the most remote regions of the planet... As part of these challenges, Venturi has obtained several records and world firsts since 2009.\n\n=== Mission 01: ''Jamais contente'' ===\n[[File:Buckeye Bullet 3 side view.jpg|thumb|VBB-3]]\nMission 01: Jamais Contente is a program launched in 2009 in partnership with the [[Ohio State University]]'s Center for Automotive Research (CAR).

Departing from Shanghai on May 3, 2010, the expedition covered 14,900 km, crossing China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, the Czech Republic and Germany, finally arriving in Paris on July 13. To date, this is the longest distance covered by an unassisted electric vehicle. This performance was accomplished by Xavier Chevrin and G\u00e9raldine Gabin. The vehicle used was an electric [[Citro\u00ebn Berlingo \u00e9lectrique|Citro\u00ebn Berlingo]] \"Powered by Venturi\". Only two battery packs were added in order to increase its range to 500 km.\n\n=== Mission 03: Antarctica ===\n[[File:Venturi Antarctica vehicle.jpg|thumb|222x222px|Venturi Antarctica vehicle]]\nMission 03 consists of the development of an electric vehicle called Antarctica, which can withstand extreme temperatures as low as -50\u00b0C. The aim of the mission will be to make this vehicle available for use by the scientific community at the South Pole where drastic measures are in place to combat all types of pollution.\n\nCurrently under development, Antarctica is undergoing several test phases before being sent to the South Pole probably by the end of 2020.\n\n=== Mission 04: Africa ===\n[[File:Venturi Global Challenges, Mission 04 \"Mission Africa\".jpg|thumb|222x222px|Venturi Global Challenges, Mission 04 ]]\nMission 04 is a modern-day version of the \u201cCroisi\u00e8re Noire\u201d (''Black Cruise''), a 1924 automobile expedition that crossed the African continent from north to south. Mission 04: Africa is the first crossing of Africa in an electric vehicle with complete autonomy.

{"title_page": "Mannerheim Museum", "text_new": "[[Image:Mannerheim Museum.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Mannerheim Museum]]\n\nThe '''Mannerheim Museum''' is located in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. It is dedicated to preserving and displaying items related to the life and times of [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]], a [[Finland|Finnish]] statesman and military officer. The Mannerheim Museum is located on top of a hill in a prestigious residential area next to the [[Kaivopuisto]] park in [[Helsinki]]. The building was the home of Mannerheim from 1924 to 1951. With the exception of a few rooms that have been converted for exhibition purposes, his home has been preserved in its original state.\n\n== History of the building ==\n\nThe building was originally constructed in 1874 and became known as the Boman Villa, after its first owner. It was the home of Mannerheim from 1924 until his death in 1951, although he never actually owned it, but rented it from the industrialist [[Karl Fazer]]. Prior to his tenancy it had been divided into six separate flats for workers in Fazer's chocolate factory, and Mannerheim had to have major alterations made before he could move in. He attached great importance to his home, which is reflected in the interiors, which he had designed himself right down to the colour schemes and the positioning of the furniture. After Mannerheim's death in 1951 the [[Mannerheim Foundation]] continued to rent the house from the Fazer family. In 1957 the house was purchased by the foundation and converted into a museum.\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\nThe museum is a mixture of original furnishing of the building from the early 1940s, and additional material brought in to illustrate the life of Mannerheim and the historical context of the period. Among the notable exhibits is an extensive collection of medals and other honours which Mannerheim received from numerous countries. Also displayed are his numerous hunting trophies, book collection, gifts and portraits of his ancestors. Mannerheim's bedroom, which is kept at its original state, displays the spartan conditions in which he preferred to sleep.

It is dedicated to preserving and displaying items related to the life and times of [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]], a [[Finland|Finnish]] statesman and military officer. The Mannerheim Museum is located on top of a hill in a prestigious residential area next to the [[Kaivopuisto]] park in [[Helsinki]]. The building was the home of Mannerheim from 1924 to 1951. With the exception of a few rooms that have been converted for exhibition purposes, his home has been preserved in its original state.\n\n== History of the building ==\n\nThe building was originally constructed in 1874 and became known as the Boman Villa, after its first owner. It was the home of Mannerheim from 1924 until his death in 1951, although he never actually owned it, but rented it from the industrialist [[Karl Fazer]]. Prior to his tenancy it had been divided into six separate flats for workers in Fazer\u2019s chocolate factory, and Mannerheim had to have major alterations made before he could move in. He attached great importance to his home, which is reflected in the interiors, which he had designed himself right down to the colour schemes and the positioning of the furniture. After Mannerheim's death in 1951 the [[Mannerheim Foundation]] continued to rent the house from the Fazer family. In 1957 the house was purchased by the foundation and converted into a museum.\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\nThe museum is a mixture of original furnishing of the building from the early 1940s, and additional material brought in to illustrate the life of Mannerheim and the historical context of the period. Among the notable exhibits is an extensive collection of medals and other honours which Mannerheim received from numerous countries. Also displayed are his numerous hunting trophies, book collection, gifts and portraits of his ancestors. Mannerheim's bedroom, which is kept at its original state, displays the spartan conditions in which he preferred to sleep. The museum also maintains an extensive archive of photographs.\n\nThe museum receives approximately 10,000 visitors a year. The entrance fee also includes a guided tour, and it is not possible to visit the museum without a guide. This is because the rooms are actually fairly small, and packed with delicate exhibits.

He may also be counted as \"Louis II.\"</ref> was the second eldest of the three sons of [[Louis the German]] and [[Hemma|Emma]].{{sfn|McKitterick|1999|p=354}} He succeeded his father as the [[King of Saxony]] on 28 August 876 and his elder brother [[Carloman of Bavaria|Carloman]] as [[King of Bavaria]] from 880 to 882. He died in 882 and was succeeded in all his territories, which encompassed most of [[East Francia]], by his younger brother, [[Charles the Fat]], already [[king of Italy]] and [[Carolingian emperor|emperor]].\n\n==Military youth==\nAs a young man, Louis was deployed in military operations against the [[Abodrites]] to the east in 858 and 862.<ref>Reuter, 72.</ref> In 854, at the invitation of the nobles of [[Aquitaine]] opposed to [[Charles the Bald]] and [[Pepin II of Aquitaine|Pepin II]], and coaxed by his father and his cousin [[Charles, Archbishop of Mainz]], he crossed into Gaul at the head of an army, intent on receiving the Aquitainian crown. He marched as far as [[Limoges]] before turning back.\n\nBack home, Louis forged close ties with the nobles of East Francia and became increasingly independent from his father. He engaged himself to the daughter of Count Adalard and, in 865, he and his brother Charles joined in rebellion against their father. This flirtation with revolt was brief, however, and Louis, Charles, and their father were reconciled later that year, though the elder Louis was forced to make a division of the remainder of his territories between his two sons. Carloman had already been given the ''[[Subkingdom (Monarchy)|subregulus]]'' of [[Bavaria]] in 864, now Louis received [[Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Franconia]] and Charles [[Alemannia]] and [[Rhaetia]].\n\nIn 869, Louis married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 885)|Liutgard of Saxony]], daughter of [[Liudolf, Duke of Saxony]], at [[Aschaffenburg]]. Liutgard was a strong-willed and politically ambitious woman and later on spurred her husband to pursue ambitious goals. This match increased tensions between father and son and in 871 and in 873, Louis rebelled, but, on each occasion, he later reconciled with his father.\n\n==Rule in Saxony==\nUpon his father's death in 876, Louis fully inherited his subkingdoms, bearing the title ''rex Francorum'' (\"king of the Franks\"). Louis the Younger considered himself the true heir of Louis the German and as his father died in 876, Louis buried him in the abbey of [[Lorsch]], in his own territories, in order to emphasise his primacy to his brothers. Louis also retained his father's chief advisor, [[Liutbert, Archbishop of Mainz|Luitbert]], [[Archbishop of Mainz]]. He and his brother ruled their kingdoms independently but cooperatively and never at war.\n\n===Acquisition of Lotharingia and Bavaria===\nLouis's rule was immediately threatened by Charles the Bald, who tried to annex the eastern parts of [[Lotharingia]] and maybe even to achieve supremacy over his nephew. Louis brought war on Charles and, on 8 October 876 at [[Andernach]], he defeated the much larger host of West Francia with a significantly smaller army. The East Frankish army displayed superiority in both unity and tactics, and the young king had even dressed his soldiers in white garments so that they appeared as an army of dead spirits.\n\nAfter this victory, Louis the German's three sons met in November at [[N\u00f6rdlingen]] to discuss the division of their father's kingdom and to have their hosts swear allegiance. According to the plan drawn up in 865, which their father, despite all his sons' rebellions, had confirmed in 872, Carloman received Bavaria, Charles Swabia, and Louis Saxony, Franconia, and Thuringia. Throughout his reign, though he is always called \"King of Saxony\" by historians, he never visited Saxony proper, though it formed the bulk of his territory. At the end of 877, the brothers assembled again to discuss the administration of their half of Lotharingia. After Carloman relinquished his claim, the realm was divided between Louis and Charles, who again met in September 878 in [[Alsace|Alsatia]]. In 879, Carloman was incapacitated by a stroke and partitioned named Louis as his successor (and erstwhile regent) in Bavaria. Louis received it a year later when Carloman expired.\n\nIn November 878 after the death of Charles the Bald, his heir, [[Louis the Stammerer]], and the latter's cousin Louis the Younger promised each other to respect the succession of their respective sons and to issue no claims contrary to that, at [[Voeren]] (''Fourons'' in [[French language|French]]). This Treaty of Fouron was soon put to the test, when Louis the Stammerer died in April 879. A party of western nobles led by [[Abbot Joscelin]] invited Louis the Younger to succeed to the rule of the western kingdom. Since his wife Luitgard also advocated heeding this call, Louis invaded West Francia. He marched as far as [[Verdun]], but after the new kings [[Louis III of France|Louis III]] and [[Carloman of France|Carloman]] ceded their part of [[Lotharingia]] to the invader, Louis retreated. In February 880, this gain was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Ribemont]], signed near [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint Quentin]]. This treaty determined the border of the two kingdoms that were to remain unchanged until the fourteenth century.\n\n===Relationship with the nobility===\nIn contrast to his father, Louis the Younger preferred reconciling royal interests with those of the nobility and avoided confrontation. He managed to bind powerful families to the king, including the [[Ottonian|Luidovingian]] relatives of his wife, that later themselves became kings and emperors. Louis mostly stayed in the [[Rhineland]], avoiding Saxony or his eastern borders. Louis did visit Bavaria on two occasions, but mostly left it to the government of his illegitimate nephew, Carloman's son, [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Arnulf]], [[Duke of Carinthia]].<ref>As \"prefect of the marches.\" Bowlus, 569.</ref>\n\n===Viking incursions===\nSince the summer of 879, [[Vikings]] had been increasing their attacks on the Frankish kingdom and occasionally penetrated deeply into the interior of the land. Louis's kingdom was the most hard-hit after that of West Francia. In February 880, Louis confronted and defeated a [[Norsemen|Norse]] host at the [[Battle of Thimeon]] (near modern [[Charleroi]]).{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}} His son Hugh, however, was killed in this battle.{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}} The next year, Louis defeated the [[Norsemen|Norse]] again at the [[Battle of Saucourt-en-Vimeu|battle of Saucourt]].{{sfn|McKitterick|1999|p=235}} Louis also drove the Norse out of the royal palace of [[Nijmegen]], which they had occupied. In the same month, a Saxon host commanded by [[Brun, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bruno]], the king's brother-in-law, suffered a heavy defeat near [[Hamburg]] and Bruno and many other Saxon nobles fell.\n\n==Death and succession==\nLouis fell sick in 881 and died in [[Frankfurt]] on 20 January 882. He was buried beside his father in the abbey of Lorsch. By his wife Luitgard of Saxony, he had had a son called Louis (877&ndash;879), who died in a fall from a palace window, and a daughter called Hildegard (878&ndash;895). Louis had also fathered an illegitimate son, Hugh (855/60 \u2013 February 880), either with the daughter of Adalard or with an earlier concubine. Since he left no heir, all his territories fell to his brother Charles, who thus could reunite the entire East Frankish kingdom. Hildegard later joined with the Bavarian magnate [[Engeldeo]] in conspiring against [[Arnulf of Carinthia|King Arnulf]] and was deprived of her \"public honours\" in 895, according to the ''[[Annals of Fulda]]''.\n\n== Family ==\nLouis the Younger married Liutgard, a daughter of Duke [[Liudolf, Duke of Saxony|Liudolf of Saxony]], Liudolf of Saxony was grandfather of King [[Henry I of Germany]].\n\n* [[Louis of Saxony|Louis]] (876 - November 879)\n* Hildegard (875/878 or 881 - after ca.900)\n* Bernhart\n\nHis illegitimate children were:\n* [[Hugo (Son of Louis the Younger)|Hugo]] (ca. 855/860 - February 880), illegitimate son{{sfn|McKitterick|1995|p=234-235}}\n* Adalhard, illegitimate son\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kings of Germany family tree]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Charles Oman|Oman, Charles]].
