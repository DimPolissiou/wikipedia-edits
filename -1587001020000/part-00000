They formed in 2009 in [[New York City]] and are currently based in [[Los Angeles]]. They are also known as two thirds of the video game-based musical trio [[Starbomb]], together with frequent collaborator [[Egoraptor|Arin Hanson]]. Avidan joined Hanson's [[YouTube]] [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] [[webseries]] ''[[Game Grumps]]'' as co-host in 2013.\n\nThe work of Ninja Sex Party typically consists of [[Rock music|rock]] or [[synthpop]]-oriented humorous songs, frequently on the topics of sex, seduction, love or [[fantasy]], with Avidan and Wecht respectively portraying the characters of Danny Sexbang, an idiotic, exuberant, [[hypersexual]] [[Jewish]] man constantly trying to hit on women, and Ninja Brian, an uncommunicative, homicidal ninja; however, their ''Under the Covers'' [[cover album]] series started in 2016 saw them take on a non-comedic approach to music for the first time, covering songs from the [[1970s in music|1970s]] and [[1980s in music|1980s]].\n\nTo date, NSP [[Ninja Sex Party discography|has released]] seven studio albums (four consisting of original material, and three cover albums), in addition to three albums as a part of Starbomb. Wecht initially acted as [[record producer]] and performed all instruments on their early albums, until they started working with producer Jim Arsenault (and later [[Jim Roach (producer)|Jim Roach]]) and [[backup band|backing band]] [[Tupper Ware Remix Party]] in 2015. Wecht and Avidan have appeared in Tupper Ware Remix Party's own works, either as individuals or as Ninja Sex Party. Since May 2018, Wecht also portrays Ninja Brian on his own live comedy show titled ''Ninja Brian's All-Star Variety Luau Spectacular''.\n\n==Career==\n===Formation and early career (2009-2012)===\n[[File:DanAvidanSkyhill.png|150px|thumb|Avidan performing in his previous band Skyhill in 2008.]]\nAvidan, who previously sang in bands such as The Northern Hues and Skyhill, initially conceptualized the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://livingmythmagazine.com/blog/2013/07/11/ninja-sex-party-tales-of-strawberries-and-cream/|last=Milne|first=Gregory|title=Ninja Sex Party: Tales of Strawberries and Cream|date=July 11, 2013|newspaper=Living Myth Magazine|publisher=Living Myth Magazine|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}</ref> In need of a band member, Avidan was introduced to Wecht, who was the musical director of a comedy troupe in New York,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2P00TWKWCs|last=Augustborn|first=Nicolas|title=Ninja Sex Party Interview|date=9 January 2013|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Nicolas Augustborn}}</ref> by a mutual friend at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]], Julie Katz, a member of Wecht's comedy troupe (who would later be featured in their music video \"The Decision\"), to whom Avidan had asked if she knew any musicians.<ref name=\"Lydia\"/><ref name=\"DDTLInterview\">{{cite web|url=https://jmorvay.wordpress.com/2010/01/14/ninja-sex-party-interview/|title=Ninja Sex Party Interview|date=2010|website=Double Down the Line|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> The band was formed in February/March 2009 with Avidan going by his stage-name/character \"Danny Sexbang\" and Wecht going by \"Ninja Brian\".<ref name=\"DDTLInterview\"/> However, the character \"Danny Sexbang\" was originally named \"Danny Sweetnuts\" before being changed to \"Sexbang\" as Avidan felt the name seemed \"stronger.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvsC5cpxEdc|title=Q&A with the Grumps! -PART 3 - GrumpOut| publisher=GrumpOut|date=July 7, 2015|access-date=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nInspired by [[The Lonely Island]] and [[Flight of the Conchords]], Ninja Sex Party was about \"a Jewish superhero who wears a unitard, with his best friend who's a ninja, and together they sing songs about dicks, and try to hit [unsuccessfully] on women.\"<ref name=\"Lydia\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhABEEqSEuM|last=Nelsen|first=Lydia|title=Ninja Sex Party Interview on ''Lydia Wants to Know''|date=24 May 2013|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Third String Kicker|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThey began performing together that summer, appearing in various film festivals, including [[SXSW]], [[Dragon Con]], and the [[L.A.

They formed in 2009 in [[New York City]] and are currently based in [[Los Angeles]]. They are also known as two thirds of the video game-based musical trio [[Starbomb]], together with frequent collaborator [[Egoraptor|Arin Hanson]]. Avidan joined Hanson's [[YouTube]] [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] [[webseries]] ''[[Game Grumps]]'' as co-host in 2013; Wecht also joined the show in 2015.\n\nThe work of Ninja Sex Party typically consists of [[Rock music|rock]] or [[synthpop]]-oriented humorous songs, frequently on the topics of sex, seduction, love or [[fantasy]], with Avidan and Wecht respectively portraying the characters of Danny Sexbang, an idiotic, exuberant, [[hypersexual]] [[Jewish]] man constantly trying to hit on women, and Ninja Brian, an uncommunicative, homicidal ninja; however, their ''Under the Covers'' [[cover album]] series started in 2016 saw them take on a non-comedic approach to music for the first time, covering songs from the [[1970s in music|1970s]] and [[1980s in music|1980s]].\n\nTo date, NSP [[Ninja Sex Party discography|has released]] seven studio albums (four consisting of original material, and three cover albums), in addition to three albums as a part of Starbomb. Wecht initially acted as [[record producer]] and performed all instruments on their early albums, until they started working with producer Jim Arsenault (and later [[Jim Roach (producer)|Jim Roach]]) and [[backup band|backing band]] [[Tupper Ware Remix Party]] in 2015. Wecht and Avidan have appeared in Tupper Ware Remix Party's own works, either as individuals or as Ninja Sex Party. Since May 2018, Wecht also portrays Ninja Brian on his own live comedy show titled ''Ninja Brian's All-Star Variety Luau Spectacular''.\n\n==Career==\n===Formation and early career (2009-2012)===\n[[File:DanAvidanSkyhill.png|150px|thumb|Avidan performing in his previous band Skyhill in 2008.]]\nAvidan, who previously sang in bands such as The Northern Hues and Skyhill, initially conceptualized the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://livingmythmagazine.com/blog/2013/07/11/ninja-sex-party-tales-of-strawberries-and-cream/|last=Milne|first=Gregory|title=Ninja Sex Party: Tales of Strawberries and Cream|date=July 11, 2013|newspaper=Living Myth Magazine|publisher=Living Myth Magazine|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}</ref> In need of a band member, Avidan was introduced to Wecht, who was the musical director of a comedy troupe in New York,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2P00TWKWCs|last=Augustborn|first=Nicolas|title=Ninja Sex Party Interview|date=9 January 2013|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Nicolas Augustborn}}</ref> by a mutual friend at the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]], Julie Katz, a member of Wecht's comedy troupe (who would later be featured in their music video \"The Decision\"), to whom Avidan had asked if she knew any musicians.<ref name=\"Lydia\"/><ref name=\"DDTLInterview\">{{cite web|url=https://jmorvay.wordpress.com/2010/01/14/ninja-sex-party-interview/|title=Ninja Sex Party Interview|date=2010|website=Double Down the Line|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> The band was formed in February/March 2009 with Avidan going by his stage-name/character \"Danny Sexbang\" and Wecht going by \"Ninja Brian\".<ref name=\"DDTLInterview\"/> However, the character \"Danny Sexbang\" was originally named \"Danny Sweetnuts\" before being changed to \"Sexbang\" as Avidan felt the name seemed \"stronger.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvsC5cpxEdc|title=Q&A with the Grumps! -PART 3 - GrumpOut| publisher=GrumpOut|date=July 7, 2015|access-date=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nInspired by [[The Lonely Island]] and [[Flight of the Conchords]], Ninja Sex Party was about \"a Jewish superhero who wears a unitard, with his best friend who's a ninja, and together they sing songs about dicks, and try to hit [unsuccessfully] on women.\"<ref name=\"Lydia\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhABEEqSEuM|last=Nelsen|first=Lydia|title=Ninja Sex Party Interview on ''Lydia Wants to Know''|date=24 May 2013|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Third String Kicker|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThey began performing together that summer, appearing in various film festivals, including [[SXSW]], [[Dragon Con]], and the [[L.A.

It is part of the [[Los Angeles Community College District]] and it is accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]].\n\n==History==\nLos Angeles Mission College is the ninth and youngest college established in the [[Los Angeles Community College District]]. It was first located in high schools, churches, office buildings, shopping centers, and other locations scattered throughout the city of [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]] and the [[Sylmar, Los Angeles|Sylmar]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]], and opened its doors to the public in February 1975 with approximately twelve hundred students. The graduating class of 1975 consisted of a single student, who had transferred to the college that semester. Within two years, over 3,000 students were taking classes in fifty different disciplines, including Administration of Justice, Business, Chemistry, Chicano Studies, English, Family and Consumer Studies, Geography, Journalism, Microbiology, Real Estate, and Zoology. The college then outgrew its locations and decided to find a permanent location for the campus. One option for the permanent campus was an empty piece of land on the SE corner of Polk and Laurel Canyon on hilly terrain across from the Interstate 5 freeway, but none took interest in it. Not even the Los Angeles Community College District took interest. So they decided for a location on Hubbard and Eldridge on the northeast part of the Sylmar neighborhood instead.\n\nSixteen years later, in the summer of 1991, the college  moved to its permanent campus, built on {{convert|22|acre|ha}} of land in the northeast part of the Sylmar neighborhood of Los Angeles on the intersection of Hubbard St and Eldridge Ave. Before the Los Angeles Community College District and Mission College purchased the 22 acres of land, it was slated for an public middle school on Hubbbard and Eldridge. The permanent campus had only a campus center with a library and the main instructional building with a culinary arts department & classes, a cafeteria, and administrative offices.\n\nSeven years after the permanent campus opened in 1991, a new Library and Learning Rescource Center opened in 1997 and relieved the old library in the Campus Center of LA Mission College. After the new library opened and built in 1997, the large indoor area in the Campus Center where the old library was turned into an event space with meeting rooms, much like a convention center has. In 2002, Mission College constructed a collaborative studies building to house more classes on the campus. By 2004, the Center for Child Development Studies building was built and opened on the permanent campus.\n\nBy 2008, the campus opened a new parking structure on the south end of the main campus, accommodating the influx of students commuting to the campus. Also in 2008, The college had broken ground on construction of a new cafeteria, student store, and culinary arts institute building at LA Mission College. In 2009, the college opened the Heath, Athletics, and Fitness building on its new east campus property, relieving the physical education classes that once housed in the storefronts of shopping centers in Sylmar. In 2009, Mission College began shuttle service between the main campus and the east campus. The old sheriff's building at the college was demolished and moved into temporary bungalow buildings. By Fall 2009, ground had broken on the new Media Arts building at Mission College and construction began on the new building.\n\nBy spring 2011, construction began on the new Center for Math and Science building at the college's East Campus. Also in that same year, the anime club at LA Mission College began by ASO,{{clarify|What is ASO?|date=April 2019}} and the college's anime club was at the height of its popularity in fall 2011. Also in fall 2011, the Los Angeles Community College District purchased an abandoned residential property on Hubbard across from the main campus and built a parking lot and asphalt areas for bungalows. The new Culinary Arts Institute building with a new cafeteria and student store was built and opened in spring 2011, relieving the old cafeteria in the Instructional Building; and the old student store in the Campus Services building. During 2011, the construction of the Media Arts building was delayed for one year until April 2012, due to a lack of funding the college has.\n\nIn 2012, the Center for Math and Science building opened in the east campus in fall 2012. In spring 2012, the first main walkway on the campus was repaved in concrete due to a new storm drain placed under. The LA Mission College shuttle service was cancelled in fall 2012, due to a lack of funding. During summer 2012, construction on the Media Arts building had resumed.\n\nOver the years from 2014 to 2016, The ASO's anime club has declined in popularity and lack of interest and was cancelled in fall 2015. By spring 2017, the new Media Arts building has finally built and opened after many delays and budget issues. By December 2017, a new transit center for the Metro Local bus routes 234 and 230 was built and began service on the main campus next to the Media Arts building, changing the bus routes and serving the east campus. In January 2018, Mission College expanded their campus and added a Sunland/ Tujunga campus location at a shopping center on Foothill Blvd.\n\n==Academics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em; margin:auto;\"\n|+ ''Fall 2017 Demographics of student body'' <ref>{{cite web|title=2017 USNEWS: Los Angeles Mission College Overview|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/community-colleges/los-angeles-mission-college-CC04809 }}</ref>\n|-\n!

It is part of the [[Los Angeles Community College District]] and it is accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]].\n\n==History==\nLos Angeles Mission College is the ninth and youngest college established in the [[Los Angeles Community College District]]. It was first located in high schools, churches, office buildings, shopping centers, and other locations scattered throughout the city of [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]] and the [[Sylmar, Los Angeles|Sylmar]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]], and opened its doors to the public in February 1975 with approximately twelve hundred students. The graduating class of 1975 consisted of a single student, who had transferred to the college that semester. Within two years, over 3,000 students were taking classes in fifty different disciplines, including Administration of Justice, Business, Chemistry, Chicano Studies, English, Family and Consumer Studies, Geography, Journalism, Microbiology, Real Estate, and Zoology. The college then outgrew its locations and decided to find a permanent location for the campus. One option for the permanent campus was an empty piece of land on the SE corner of Polk and Laurel Canyon on hilly terrain across from the Interstate 5 freeway, but none took interest in it. Not even the Los Angeles Community College District took interest. So they decided for a location on Hubbard and Eldridge on the northeast part of the Sylmar neighborhood instead.\n\nSixteen years later, in the summer of 1991, the college  moved to its permanent campus, built on {{convert|22|acre|ha}} of land in the northeast part of the Sylmar neighborhood of Los Angeles on the intersection of Hubbard St and Eldridge Ave. Before the Los Angeles Community College District and Mission College purchased the 22 acres of land, it was slated for an public middle school on Hubbbard and Eldridge. The permanent campus had only a campus center with a library and the main instructional building with a culinary arts department & classes, a cafeteria, and administrative offices.\n\nSeven years after the permanent campus opened in 1991, a new Library and Learning Rescource Center opened in 1997 and relieved the old library in the Campus Center of LA Mission College. After the new library opened and built in 1997, the large indoor area in the Campus Center where the old library was turned into an event space with meeting rooms, much like a convention center has. In 2002, Mission College constructed a collaborative studies building to house more classes on the campus. By 2004, the Center for Child Development Studies building was built and opened on the permanent campus.\n\nBy 2008, the campus opened a new parking structure on the south end of the main campus, accommodating the influx of students commuting to the campus. Also in 2008, The college had broken ground on construction of a new cafeteria, student store, and culinary arts institute building at LA Mission College. In 2009, the college opened the Heath, Athletics, and Fitness building on its new east campus property, relieving the physical education classes that once housed in the storefronts of shopping centers in Sylmar. In 2009, Mission College began shuttle service between the main campus and the east campus. The old sheriff's building at the college was demolished and moved into temporary bungalow buildings. By Fall 2009, ground had broken on the new Media Arts building at Mission College and construction began on the new building.\n\nBy spring 2011, construction began on the new Center for Math and Science building at the college's East Campus. Also in that same year, the anime club at LA Mission College began by ASO,{{clarify|What is ASO?|date=April 2019}} and the college's anime club was at the height of its popularity in fall 2011. Also in fall 2011, the Los Angeles Community College District purchased an abandoned residential property on Hubbard across from the main campus and built a parking lot and asphalt areas for bungalows. The new Culinary Arts Institute building with a new cafeteria and student store was built and opened in spring 2011, relieving the old cafeteria in the Instructional Building; and the old student store in the Campus Services building. During 2011, the construction of the Media Arts building was delayed for one year until April 2012, due to a lack of funding the college has.\n\nIn 2012, the Center for Math and Science building opened in the east campus in fall 2012. In spring 2012, the first main walkway on the campus was repaved in concrete due to a new storm drain placed under. The LA Mission College shuttle service was cancelled in fall 2012, due to a lack of funding. During summer 2012, construction on the Media Arts building had resumed.\n\nOver the years from 2014 to 2016, The ASO's anime club has declined in popularity and lack of interest and was cancelled in fall 2015. By spring 2017, the new Media Arts building has finally built and opened after many delays and budget issues. By December 2017, a new transit center for the Metro Local bus routes 234 and 230 was built and began service on the main campus next to the Media Arts building, changing the bus routes and serving the east campus. In January 2018, Mission College expanded their campus and added a Sunland/ Tujunga campus location at a shopping center on Foothill Blvd.\n\n==Academics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em; margin:auto;\"\n|+ ''Fall 2017 Demographics of student body'' <ref>{{cite web|title=2017 USNEWS: Los Angeles Mission College Overview|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/community-colleges/los-angeles-mission-college-CC04809 }}</ref>\n|-\n!

Some patriarchal societies are also [[patrilineal]], meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.\n\nPatriarchy is associated with a set of ideas, a patriarchal [[ideology]] that acts to explain and justify this dominance and attributes it to inherent natural differences between men and women. Sociologists tend to see patriarchy as a social product and not as an outcome of innate differences between the sexes and they focus attention on the way that [[gender role]]s in a society affect power differentials between men and women.<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\"Henslin\"/>\n\nHistorically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures.<ref>{{cite book |last= Malti-Douglas |first=Fedwa |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |year=2007 |publisher= Macmillan |location=Detroit |isbn=978-0-02-865960-2}}{{Page needed |date=October 2017}}</ref> Even if not explicitly defined to be by their own constitutions and laws, most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions |volume=1 |last=Lockard |first=Craig |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=9780547047669 |location= |pages=111\u2013114 |quote=Today, as in the past, men generally hold political, economic, and religious power in most societies. }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies|first1=Carole|title=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies, 5 Volume Set|pages=1\u20133|last1=Pateman|chapter=Sexual Contract|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|year=2016|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-4051-9694-9|doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and usage==\n''Patriarchy'' literally means \"the rule of the father\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Ferguson, Kathy E. |chapter=Patriarchy |editor=Tierney, Helen |title=Women's Studies Encyclopedia, Volume 2 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-31072-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1048 1048] |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bDxJW3x4f8C&pg=PA1048 |url=https://archive.org/details/womensstudiesenc0001unse/page/1048 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Green, Fiona Joy |chapter=Patriarchal Ideology of Motherhood |editor=O'Reilly, Andrea |title= Encyclopedia of Motherhood, Volume 1 |publisher=SAGE |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-6846-1 |page=969 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pcxqzal4bEYC&pg=PA969 }}</ref> and comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 (''patriarkh\u0113s''),<ref>{{cite web |title=patriarchy |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/patriarchy |website=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> \"father or chief of a race\",<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9-\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpatria%2Frxhs |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> which is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac (''patria''), \"lineage, descent\"<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9-\u03ac {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpatria%2F |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> (from \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 ''pat\u0113r'', \"father\"<ref>{{cite web |title=\u03c0\u03b1^\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpath%2Fr |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>) and \u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9 (''arkh\u014d''), \"rule, govern\".<ref>{{cite web |title=\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9 {{!}} Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frxw |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the term ''patriarchy'' has been used to refer to [[autocratic]] rule by the male head of a family; however, since the late 20th century it has also been used to refer to social systems in which power is primarily held by adult men,<ref name=\"Cannell & Green\">{{cite book |last1=Cannell |first1=Fenella |last2=Green |first2=Sarah |editor1-last=Kuper |editor1-first=Adam |editor2-last=Kuper |editor2-first=Jessica |title=The Social Science Encyclopedia |date=1996 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-41-510829-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/socialscienceenc0002unse/page/592 592] |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Social_Science_Encyclopedia.html?id=S3zZ18tt3gkC&q=patriarchy |chapter=Patriarchy |url=https://archive.org/details/socialscienceenc0002unse/page/592 }}</ref><ref name=\"Meagher\">{{Cite book |last=Meagher |first=Michelle |chapter=patriarchy |editor1-last=Ritzer |editor1-first=George |editor2-last=Ryan |editor2-first=J.

Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not.

Thus, the evolution of science in a patriarchal society's focus begins with man and woman. The male [[testosterone]] hormone is, for instance, known to greatly enhance risk taking behaviour, which can generate increased status in groups if successful (balanced with an equal increase in number of failures, with potential losses of status or death as result). The potential magnitude, frequency and longevity of the increased status from a hormonally driven risk-taking success depends on opportunities, which increases rapidly with societal complexity.\n\nOther proponents of this theory posit that because of a woman's biology, she is more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles.

[[Shulamith Firestone]], a radical-libertarian feminist, defines patriarchy as a system of [[oppression]] of women. Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not. Firestone writes that patriarchal ideologies support the oppression of women and gives as an example the joy of giving birth, which she labels a patriarchal myth. For Firestone, women must gain control over reproduction in order to be free from oppression.<ref name=\":0\" /> Feminist historian [[Gerda Lerner]] believes that male control over women's sexuality and reproductive functions is a fundamental cause and result of patriarchy.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Alison Jaggar]] also understands patriarchy as the primary cause of women's oppression. The system of patriarchy accomplishes this by alienating women from their bodies.\n\nInteractive systems theorists [[Iris Marion Young]] and [[Heidi Hartmann]] believe that patriarchy and [[capitalism]] interact together to oppress women. Young, Hartmann, and other [[Socialist feminism|socialist]] and [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminists]] use the terms ''patriarchal capitalism'' or ''capitalist patriarchy'' to describe the interactive relationship of capitalism and patriarchy in producing and reproducing the oppression of women.<ref name=\"Tong\">{{Cite book|title=Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction|last1=Rosemarie|first1=Tong|last2=Botts|first2=Tina Fernandes|date=2017-07-18|isbn=9780813350707|edition= Fifth |location=New York|pages=|oclc=979993556}}</ref> According to Hartmann, the term ''patriarchy'' redirects the focus of oppression from the [[Division of labour|labour division]] to a moral and political responsibility liable directly to men as a [[gender]].

Thus, the evolution of science in a patriarchal society's focus begins with man and woman. The male [[testosterone]] hormone is, for instance, known to greatly enhance risk taking behaviour, which can generate increased status in groups if successful (balanced with an equal increase in number of failures, with potential losses of status or death as result). The potential magnitude, frequency and longevity of the increased status from a hormonally driven risk-taking success depends on opportunities, which increases rapidly with societal complexity.\n\nOther proponents of this theory posit that because of a woman's biology, she is more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles. Through this basis, \"the existence of a [[Sexual division of labour|sexual division of labor]] in primitive societies is a starting point as much for purely social accounts of the origins of patriarchy as for biological.\"<ref name=\"Lewontin\" />{{rp|157}} Hence, the rise of patriarchy is recognized through this apparent \"sexual division\".<ref name=\"Lewontin\" />\n\nSome [[sociobiologist]]s, such as [[Steven Goldberg]], argue that social behavior is primarily determined by [[genetics]], and thus that patriarchy arises more as a result of inherent biology than [[social conditioning]]. Goldberg also contends that patriarchy is a universal feature of [[Culture|human culture]]. In 1973, Goldberg wrote, \"The [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] studies of every society that has ever been observed explicitly state that these feelings were present, there is literally no variation at all.\"<ref name=\"Goldberg, Steven\">{{cite book | last = Goldberg | first = Steven | title = The inevitability of patriarchy | publisher = W.
