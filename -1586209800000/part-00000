It is the [[capital city]] of the [[Poltava Oblast]] ([[Oblast|province]]) and of the surrounding [[Poltava Raion]] ([[raion|district]]) of the oblast. Poltava is administratively incorporated as a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and does not belong to the [[raion]]. It has a population of 289,000.\n\n==History==\nIt is still unknown when Poltava was founded, although the town was not attested before 1174. However, for reasons unknown,{{cn|date=December 2017}} municipal authorities chose to celebrate the city's 1100th anniversary in 1999. The settlement is indeed an old one, as archeologists unearthed a [[Paleolithic]] dwelling as well as [[Scythian]] remains within the city limits.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe present name of the city is traditionally connected to the settlement [[Ltava]] which is mentioned in the [[Hypatian Chronicle]] in 1174.<ref name=hop>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160716133914/http://histpol.pl.ua/ru/poltava-istoricheskie-ocherki/khronika-sobytij?id=811 Poltava: chronicles of the most important events]. \"History of Poltava\" website.</ref><ref>Antipovich, G., Buryak, Voloskov, V., others.

Since much of that area had only recently been seized from the [[Ottoman Empire]] by Russia, and a large number of Orthodox Greek settlers had been invited to settle in the region, the [[Russian Empire|Imperial]] Government selected a renowned Greek scholar, [[Eugenios Voulgaris]], to preside over the new diocese.

As [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] celebrated his victory in the Saviour church, this 17th-century wooden shrine was carefully preserved to this day. The five-domed city cathedral, dedicated to the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], is a superb monument of [[Cossack Baroque]], built between 1699 and 1709. As a whole, the cathedral presents a unity which even the Neoclassical belltower has failed to mar.

Local municipal routes are parked along the [[Taras Shevchenko]] Street.

It is the [[capital city]] of the [[Poltava Oblast]] ([[Oblast|province]]) and of the surrounding [[Poltava Raion]] ([[raion|district]]) of the oblast. Poltava is administratively incorporated as a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and does not belong to the [[raion]]. It has a population of 289,000.\n\n==History==\nIt is still unknown when Poltava was founded, although the town was not attested before 1174. However, for reasons unknown,{{cn|date=December 2017}} municipal authorities chose to celebrate the city's 1100th anniversary in 1999. The settlement is indeed an old one, as archeologists unearthed a [[Paleolithic]] dwelling as well as [[Scythian]] remains within the city limits.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe present name of the city is traditionally connected to the settlement [[Ltava]] which is mentioned in the [[Hypatian Chronicle]] in 1174.<ref name=hop>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160716133914/http://histpol.pl.ua/ru/poltava-istoricheskie-ocherki/khronika-sobytij?id=811 Poltava: chronicles of the most important events]. \"History of Poltava\" website.</ref><ref>Antipovich, G., Buryak, Voloskov, V., others.

Since much of that area had only recently been seized from the [[Ottoman Empire]] by Russia, and a large number of Orthodox Greek settlers had been invited to settle in the region, the [[Russian Empire|Imperial]] Government selected a renowned Greek scholar, [[Eugenios Voulgaris]], to preside over the new diocese.

As [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] celebrated his victory in the Saviour church, this 17th-century wooden shrine was carefully preserved to this day. The five-domed city cathedral, dedicated to the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], is a superb monument of [[Cossack Baroque]], built between 1699 and 1709. As a whole, the cathedral presents a unity which even the Neoclassical belltower has failed to mar.

The PCjr was positioned as a complement to the very successful [[IBM Personal Computer]] (PC), competing with other [[home computer]]s such as the [[Apple II series]] and the [[Commodore 64]]. It retains the IBM PC's [[Intel 8088|8088]] [[CPU]] and [[BIOS]] interface, but provides enhanced graphics and sound capabilities over the original IBM PC, [[ROM cartridge]] slots, joystick ports, and an infrared wireless keyboard. The PCjr supports expansion via \"sidecar\" modules, which are attached to the side of the unit. New software such as ''[[King's Quest I]]'' showcased its [[PC gaming]] capabilities.\n\nDespite widespread anticipation, the PCjr's launch was unsuccessful. IBM's inexperience with the consumer market led to unclear positioning, with analysts believing that IBM was unsuccessful at justifying the PCjr's higher cost in comparison to competitors such as the Commodore 64 and Apple II. It is only partially [[IBM PC compatible|IBM compatible]], so compatibility with existing PC software such as the [[killer app]] [[Lotus 1-2-3]] was not guaranteed. The PCjr's [[chiclet keyboard]] was widely criticized for its poor quality, with critics stating that it was unsuitable for extended use such as word processing. The PCjr's expandability is limited, and it was initially offered with up to 128&nbsp;KB of RAM only, insufficient for many IBM PC programs.\n\nIn 1984, IBM offered free replacement keyboards with a more traditional design, and a new 512&nbsp;KB RAM upgrade. A large advertising campaign promoted the PCjr's compatibility with \"over 1000\" of the most popular IBM PC applications (including a new [[porting|port]] of Lotus 1-2-3), and new discounted pricing and other bundle offers. PCjr sales greatly increased, amazing observers that saw it as a failure.\n\nBy January 1985, when the discounts ended, IBM had sold 250,000 PCjr computers, with 200,000 in the fourth quarter of 1984 alone. Unable to sell the computer without discounts, IBM abruptly discontinued the PCjr in March 1985 and would not produce a home-oriented computer until the [[IBM PS/1|PS/1]] in 1990. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the PCjr as \"one of the biggest flops in the history of computing\", with critics comparing it to the [[Edsel|Ford Edsel]] and [[New Coke]]. Inexpensive and almost entirely compatible [[PC clone]]s became popular in 1985 including the [[Tandy 1000]]. The Tandy was much more successful than the PCjr it imitated, and PCjr's enhanced graphics and sound standards became known as \"[[Tandy Graphics Adapter|Tandy-compatible]]\".\n\n==Description==\n\n===Overview===\nAnnounced November 1, 1983, and first shipped in late January 1984,<ref name=\"sanger19840517\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/17/business/ibm-s-problems-with-junior.html?pagewanted=all | title=I.B.M.'s Problems with Junior | accessdate=February 25, 2011 | author=Sanger, David E. | date=May 17, 1984 | newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> the PCjr&mdash;nicknamed \"Peanut\" before its debut<ref name=\"time19840402\" />&mdash;came in two models: the '''4860-004''', with 64&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of memory, priced at US$669 ({{Inflation|US|669|1983|fmt=eq}}); and the '''4860-067''', with 128&nbsp;KB of memory and a 360&nbsp;KB 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, priced at US$1,269 ({{Inflation|US|1269|1983|fmt=eq}}). It was manufactured for IBM in [[Lewisburg, Tennessee]] by [[Teledyne Technologies|Teledyne]]. The PCjr promised a high degree of compatibility with the [[IBM PC]], which was already a popular business computer, in addition to offering built-in color graphics and 3 voice sound that was better than the standard [[PC speaker|PC-speaker]] sound and [[Color Graphics Adapter|color graphics]] of the standard IBM PC and compatibles of the day.  The PCjr was also the first PC compatible machine that was expressly designed to support [[page flipping]] for graphics operations. Since the PCjr uses system [[Random-access memory|RAM]] to store video content, and the location of this storage area can be changed, it can perform flicker-free animation and other effects that are difficult or impossible to produce on contemporary PC clones.\n\n====Video====\nUnlike the standard IBM PC, the PCjr has onboard video hardware. It is an improved subset of the [[Color/Graphics Adapter|CGA]] standard. The four CGA video modes (40x25 text, 80x25 text, 320x200x4, and 640x200x2 graphics) are supported in addition to three new graphics modes (160x200x16, 320x200x16, and 640x200x4). The 80x25 text mode, 320x200x16, and 640x200x4 modes are referred to in IBM's documentation as \"the high bandwidth modes\"; they are not supported on base models with only 64k of memory. The PCjr also has a composite video out and can support artifact colors on a TV or composite monitor much like the CGA cards, although the colors are slightly different. The PCjr also has palette registers which allow the colors to be redefined for any of the available 16\u2014this feature was retained in EGA and VGA cards. When the BIOS is used to set a video mode, it always sets up the PCjr palette table (i.e. the 16 palette registers) to emulate the CGA color palette for that mode.  Programs specifically written to use PCjr graphics can subsequently reprogram the palette table to use any colors desired.  Palette changes must be made during horizontal or vertical blanking periods of a video frame in order to avoid corrupting the display.  However, the provision of a vertical retrace interrupt (on IRQ5) simplifies this and also makes seamless page-flipping much easier. Although standard PC video cards had a flag to indicate that the vertical retrace was in progress, the PCjr added for the first time the ability to generate raster or VBLANK interrupts on IRQ 5. This allows the use of mixed video modes. The PCjr video subsystem also has a little-known graphics blink feature, which toggles the palette between the first and second groups of eight palette registers at the same rate used for the text blink feature, and a palette bit-masking feature that can be used to switch between palette subsets without reprogramming palette registers, by forcing one or more bits of each pixel value to zero before the value is used to look up the color in the palette table.\n\nVideo modes on the PCjr use varying amounts of system memory; 40x25 text mode uses 1k and 320x200x16 and 640x200x4 use 32k. Multiple text or graphics pages can be used as long as there is enough memory for them, thus the two largest modes allow only two graphics pages. The ability to page flip graphics modes answered one of the common criticisms of the CGA card, which had 16k of video memory and only supports multiple pages in text mode. Of the three new modes, 160x200x16 mode has the same layout as CGA graphics modes; the odd and even scanlines are stored in the first and second half of the video buffer, each half being 8k in size, and every four bits represents one pixel. The 320x200x16 and 640x200x4 modes have four blocks of scanlines; every four or two bits respectively represents a pixel.\n\nSince the PCjr uses the main system RAM for the video buffer, less memory is available for software than on a standard PC, which has its video memory in the A000h-BFFFh segments, above conventional memory.\n\n====Software====\nThe register mapping of the PCjr's video hardware is different from the standard CGA card, so software that tries to modify or read registers directly will not work\u2014the PCjr has a \"gate\" register in which the user writes the number of the video register to be accessed, followed by the value to be written into it.  Alteration of other CRTC registers cannot be assumed to produce the same results from the PCjr video system as from the CGA (and might damage the monitor).  (Programs for the CGA that manipulate the CRTC start address and that rely on address wrap-around above address 0xBC000 may not work correctly on the PCjr, because it always has a 32&nbsp;KB contiguous block of RAM in the video area from address 0xB8000 through 0xBFFFF.) The PCjr's video memory cannot be moved above 128k if expansion memory is added; some PC software that ran off of self-booting disks (mainly games) would not work on a PCjr if the software required more than 128k.\n\nPC DOS 2.10 was the minimum version of DOS required for the PCjr; IBM's OEM versions of MS-DOS supported the machine up to DOS 3.30, but memory expansion was required for DOS 3.20 and 3.30.\n\n====Hardware====\nThe PCjr display hardware consists primarily of two chips on the system board: a standard Motorola 6845 CRTC like the one used in the MDA and CGA adapters, and a custom IBM chip called the [[Video Gate Array]] (VGA)<ref name=\"vga\">VGA should not be confused with the later [[Video Graphics Array]] standard that IBM released with the [[PS/2]] line in 1987.</ref>{{r|nortonpcjrvideo19840124}}  The 6845 is responsible for the basic raster timing and video data address sequencing, and the Video Gate Array contains all the additional timing logic, the video data demultiplexing and color processing logic, and the programmable palette table logic, as well as the logic for multiplexing RAM access between the 8088 CPU and the video generation circuitry.  The 6845 CRTC and the VGA together are completely responsible for refreshing the internal DRAM of the PCjr (64 or 128&nbsp;KB), and this complicates the process of switching video modes on the PCjr.  (Resetting the VGA, which must be done during certain video mode switches, must be done by code not running from the internal RAM, and if the CRTC or the VGA is disabled for too long, the contents of the internal RAM can be lost.)  Additional external DRAM, in sidecar expansion modules, is refreshed separately, not by the CRTC and VGA.\n\n[[File:IBM PCB Jr Motherboard.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr Motherboard]]\n\n[[File:IBM PCB Jr Internal.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr Internal]]\n\n====Sound====\nThe PCjr's sound is provided by a [[Texas Instruments]] [[SN76496]] which can produce three square waves of varying amplitude and frequency along with a noise channel powered by a [[shift register]].<ref name=\"nortonpcjraudio19840124\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSzKzjWHeVEC&lpg=PA61&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Sound Abilities: The PCjr | work=PC Magazine | date=January 24, 1984 | accessdate=October 23, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=137}}</ref> This device is sometimes also called a PSG (Programmable Sound Generator), and essentially equivalent devices were also used in the contemporary [[Sega Master System]] and the later [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]]. The PCjr design also allows for an analog sound source in an expansion-bus \"sidecar\" module, and software-controlled internal analog switch can select the source for the sound output from among the PC speaker, the SN76489, the cassette port, or the expansion-bus sound source.  Only one sound source can be selected at a time; the sources cannot be mixed.\n\n====Processor speed====\nThe PCjr's 4.77&nbsp;MHz [[Intel 8088]] [[CPU]] is faster than that of other computers that were aimed at the home market at the time,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} though the stock PCjr usually does not run at the full rated 4.77&nbsp;MHz because access to the internal RAM is slowed by [[wait state]]s added by the Video Gate Array to synchronize shared access to RAM between the CPU and the video hardware. IBM claimed that an average of two wait states are added, but the designers of the Tandy 1000 claimed that six was a more accurate figure.<ref name=\"vose198412\">{{Cite magazine |last=Vose |first=G. Michael |date=December 1984 |title=The Tandy 1000 |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n99/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=98\u2013104}}</ref> However, this does not apply to programs or data located in ROM, including software on ROM cartridges plugged into the front of the PCjr, or located in additional RAM in a sidecar attachment; it only applies to the first 64 KB or 128 KB of RAM inside the system unit.  Therefore, under some circumstances the 8088 in the PCjr actually can run at the rated 4.77&nbsp;MHz.  The most common instances in which this maximum speed would be achieved are when running games or productivity applications from ROM cartridges; this would be a reason for PCjr users to prefer software in cartridges to software on disk media.  In fact, because the PCjr video subsystem continuously refreshes the system internal DRAM transparently, without disturbing the CPU, programs running from ROM on the PCjr will actually run slightly faster on the PCjr than on an IBM PC or XT.  This is because the PC and XT keep their DRAM refreshed by using a DMA channel to periodically request the bus from the CPU in order to perform a refresh cycle, whereas a program running from ROM on a PCjr will never be suspended for internal DRAM refresh cycles. To increase the system-speed of the IBM PCjr you can install a [[NEC V20]] instead of the 8088.\n\n====Wireless keyboard====\nThe detached wireless infrared keyboard promised a degree of convenience none of its competitors had, eliciting visions of word processing wirelessly from one's [[couch]] with the computer connected to a TV set as a display.{{r|hoffmann198403}}  For infrared wireless operation, it was powered by four common AA cells.  A keyboard cord option, that plugged into the keyboard with a modular 4-position telephone plug and into the back of the computer with a 6-pin (2x3) header connected, was also available for increased security and reliability. The cord also eliminated dependence on batteries; the keyboard IR receiver was automatically disabled when the keyboard cord was attached to the computer.\n\n===Differences from the IBM PC===\nWith a built-in [[RF modulator]], the PCjr can send video and audio to a television receiver; it also has an audio output jack to connect to an amplifier. The PCjr Color Display sold by IBM included an internal amplified speaker, being the only IBM monitor in the PC line to do so. [[IBM BASIC#IBM PCjr Cartridge BASIC|Cartridge BASIC]] enhances the standard IBM BASIC with commands to support the new video and audio functionality.<ref name=\"nortonpcjrvideo19840124\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSzKzjWHeVEC&lpg=PA61&pg=PA128#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Screening the PCjr's Color, Video, And Memory Options | work=PC Magazine | date=January 24, 1984 | access-date=October 23, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=128}}</ref>{{r|nortonpcjraudio19840124}} Two joystick ports are also evidence of IBM's goal for marketing the PCjr as a home-friendly machine to compete with popular home machines like the Commodore 64, the Atari home computers, and the Apple II line. Other than the [[Tandy 1000]], which was designed as an enhanced PCjr clone to directly compete with the PCjr, and [[PC1512|Amstrad IBM PC compatible]] lines a few years later, the dual built-in joystick ports introduced by the PCjr never became standard on IBM PC compatibles, and have not been seen since. However, the single 15-pin D-subminiature joystick port common on later PCs supports two two-axis, two-button joysticks like those supported by the PCjr, and the 15-pin port can be split out to two separate joystick ports with a passive Y-adapter cable.\n\nFurther reinforcing the \"home-friendly\" goal, the PCjr also introduced two [[ROM cartridge]] slots on the front of the unit, meant to load software quickly and easily. The cartridges are plugged in from the front, prompting the computer to automatically reboot and run the software. This is more [[Usability|user-friendly]] than other home computer systems, which must be powered off when a cartridge was removed or inserted and come with warnings about damage to the computer if this requirement is ignored. Loading and saving data from cartridge software is possible via the floppy drive. The cartridge BASIC for the PCjr, in particular, gives programmers the advantage of a real programming language always ready without taking up system memory, as it was firmware, with its own address space. Being stored in ROM the BASIC loads very quickly, not needing access to the floppy disk or other storage.\n\nCartridges can also replace the system BIOS and other firmware.<ref name=\"norton19840320\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1tFFnOMCvv4C&lpg=PA477&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Unearthing The PCjr's Secrets | work=PC Magazine | date=March 20, 1984 | access-date=October 24, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=111}}</ref> A number of patches from various vendors are included on a single \"combo-cartridge\", licensed and sold by PC Enterprises, to support add-on hardware, bypass certain limitations of design, and keep up with changing OS requirements.\n\nExpansions (such as additional parallel ports, serial ports, memory, etc.) to the PCjr are provided via add-on [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|\"sidecars\" that attach to the side of the PCjr]]. Multiple expansions are stacked together, increasing the width of the machine.\n\nThe floppy controller on the PCjr had its I/O registers mapped into different ports than on the PC, since the PCjr also did not have DMA, the BIOS routines for handling floppy access were different and more complex than those on the PC. Software that tried to perform direct, low-level disk access (mainly utilities, but also the occasional game such as ''Dunzhin: Warrior of Ras'') would not work unless it was rewritten for the PCjr.\n\nThe internal floppy drive on the PCjr was a half-height [[Qume]] 5.25\" unit; IBM also used these drives in the PC Portable, but the PCjr units were specially equipped with a small fan to prevent overheating since the computer did not have a case fan.\n\nThe PCjr's video uses 32&nbsp;kB of RAM as [[shared graphics memory]], which prevents using additional memory with the built-in 128&nbsp;KB under DOS.{{r|norton19840320}}  The specific issue is that while additional external RAM can be added directly above the internal RAM, making a [[flat memory model|flat model]], if the display is used, its buffer must reside somewhere within the first 128&nbsp;KB of RAM (from where it is mirrored at address 0xB8000).  Stock MS-DOS is not prepared to work around the video buffer in low RAM, using RAM both below and above it.  Two obvious solutions exist: Use the additional memory as a [[RAM drive]], or not use the built-in 128&nbsp;KB.<ref name=\"norton19840626\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGkuDrOYjOcC&lpg=PA407&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Adding to Junior's Memory | work=PC Magazine | date=June 26, 1984 | access-date=October 24, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=98}}</ref>  Another option would be to load a special DOS device driver or TSR, which would claim the RAM selected for use as the video buffer, causing DOS to load other drivers and programs above it.  A fourth option would be not to use MS-DOS, or to use a specially modified version of it.  For programs running from ROM cartridges, not using DOS was a very viable option, even in the mid-1980s when the PCjr was being marketed.\n[[File:IBM PC Jr BASIC Cartridge.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr BASIC Cartridge]]\n\n===Differences from other personal computers===\nThe PCjr initially shipped with a wireless [[chiclet keyboard]] called the \"Freeboard\",<ref name=\"halfhill198410\"/> powered by four AA batteries to provide infrared line-of-sight wireless communication.

The PCjr was positioned as a complement to the very successful [[IBM Personal Computer]] (PC), competing with other [[home computer]]s such as the [[Apple II series]] and the [[Commodore 64]]. It retains the IBM PC's [[Intel 8088|8088]] [[CPU]] and [[BIOS]] interface, but provides enhanced graphics and sound capabilities over the original IBM PC, [[ROM cartridge]] slots, joystick ports, and an infrared wireless keyboard. The PCjr supports expansion via \"sidecar\" modules, which are attached to the side of the unit. New software such as ''[[King's Quest I]]'' showcased its [[PC gaming]] capabilities.\n\nDespite widespread anticipation, the PCjr's launch was unsuccessful. IBM's inexperience with the consumer market led to unclear positioning, with analysts believing that IBM was unsuccessful at justifying the PCjr's higher cost in comparison to competitors such as the Commodore 64 and Apple II. It is only partially [[IBM PC compatible|IBM compatible]], so compatibility with existing PC software such as the [[killer app]] [[Lotus 1-2-3]] was not guaranteed. The PCjr's [[chiclet keyboard]] was widely criticized for its poor quality, with critics stating that it was unsuitable for extended use such as word processing. The PCjr's expandability is limited, and it was initially offered with up to 128&nbsp;KB of RAM only, insufficient for many IBM PC programs.\n\nIn 1984, IBM offered free replacement keyboards with a more traditional design, and a new 512&nbsp;KB RAM upgrade. A large advertising campaign promoted the PCjr's compatibility with \"over 1000\" of the most popular IBM PC applications (including a new [[porting|port]] of Lotus 1-2-3), and new discounted pricing and other bundle offers. PCjr sales greatly increased, amazing observers that saw it as a failure.\n\nBy January 1985, when the discounts ended, IBM had sold 250,000 PCjr computers, with 200,000 in the fourth quarter of 1984 alone. Unable to sell the computer without discounts, IBM abruptly discontinued the PCjr in March 1985 and would not produce a home-oriented computer until the [[IBM PS/1|PS/1]] in 1990. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the PCjr as \"one of the biggest flops in the history of computing\", with critics comparing it to the [[Edsel|Ford Edsel]] and [[New Coke]]. Inexpensive and almost entirely compatible [[PC clone]]s became popular in 1985 including the [[Tandy 1000]]. The Tandy was much more successful than the PCjr it imitated, and PCjr's enhanced graphics and sound standards became known as \"[[Tandy Graphics Adapter|Tandy-compatible]]\".\n\n==Description==\n\n===Overview===\nAnnounced November 1, 1983, and first shipped in late January 1984,<ref name=\"sanger19840517\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/17/business/ibm-s-problems-with-junior.html?pagewanted=all | title=I.B.M.'s Problems with Junior | accessdate=February 25, 2011 | author=Sanger, David E. | date=May 17, 1984 | newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> the PCjr&mdash;nicknamed \"Peanut\" before its debut<ref name=\"time19840402\" />&mdash;came in two models: the '''4860-004''', with 64&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of memory, priced at US$669 ({{Inflation|US|669|1983|fmt=eq}}); and the '''4860-067''', with 128&nbsp;KB of memory and a 360&nbsp;KB 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, priced at US$1,269 ({{Inflation|US|1269|1983|fmt=eq}}). It was manufactured for IBM in [[Lewisburg, Tennessee]] by [[Teledyne Technologies|Teledyne]]. The PCjr promised a high degree of compatibility with the [[IBM PC]], which was already a popular business computer, in addition to offering built-in color graphics and 3 voice sound that was better than the standard [[PC speaker|PC-speaker]] sound and [[Color Graphics Adapter|color graphics]] of the standard IBM PC and compatibles of the day.  The PCjr was also the first PC compatible machine that was expressly designed to support [[page flipping]] for graphics operations. Since the PCjr uses system [[Random-access memory|RAM]] to store video content, and the location of this storage area can be changed, it can perform flicker-free animation and other effects that are difficult or impossible to produce on contemporary PC clones.\n\n====Video====\nUnlike the standard IBM PC, the PCjr has onboard video hardware. It is an improved subset of the [[Color/Graphics Adapter|CGA]] standard. The four CGA video modes (40x25 text, 80x25 text, 320x200x4, and 640x200x2 graphics) are supported in addition to three new graphics modes (160x200x16, 320x200x16, and 640x200x4). The 80x25 text mode, 320x200x16, and 640x200x4 modes are referred to in IBM's documentation as \"the high bandwidth modes\"; they are not supported on base models with only 64k of memory. The PCjr also has a composite video out and can support artifact colors on a TV or composite monitor much like the CGA cards, although the colors are slightly different. The PCjr also has palette registers which allow the colors to be redefined for any of the available 16\u2014this feature was retained in EGA and VGA cards. When the BIOS is used to set a video mode, it always sets up the PCjr palette table (i.e. the 16 palette registers) to emulate the CGA color palette for that mode.  Programs specifically written to use PCjr graphics can subsequently reprogram the palette table to use any colors desired.  Palette changes must be made during horizontal or vertical blanking periods of a video frame in order to avoid corrupting the display.  However, the provision of a vertical retrace interrupt (on IRQ5) simplifies this and also makes seamless page-flipping much easier. Although standard PC video cards had a flag to indicate that the vertical retrace was in progress, the PCjr added for the first time the ability to generate raster or VBLANK interrupts on IRQ 5. This allows the use of mixed video modes. The PCjr video subsystem also has a little-known graphics blink feature, which toggles the palette between the first and second groups of eight palette registers at the same rate used for the text blink feature, and a palette bit-masking feature that can be used to switch between palette subsets without reprogramming palette registers, by forcing one or more bits of each pixel value to zero before the value is used to look up the color in the palette table.\n\nVideo modes on the PCjr use varying amounts of system memory; 40x25 text mode uses 1k and 320x200x16 and 640x200x4 use 32k. Multiple text or graphics pages can be used as long as there is enough memory for them, thus the two largest modes allow only two graphics pages. The ability to page flip graphics modes answered one of the common criticisms of the CGA card, which had 16k of video memory and only supports multiple pages in text mode. Of the three new modes, 160x200x16 mode has the same layout as CGA graphics modes; the odd and even scanlines are stored in the first and second half of the video buffer, each half being 8k in size, and every four bits represents one pixel. The 320x200x16 and 640x200x4 modes have four blocks of scanlines; every four or two bits respectively represents a pixel.\n\nSince the PCjr uses the main system RAM for the video buffer, less memory is available for software than on a standard PC, which has its video memory in the A000h-BFFFh segments, above conventional memory.\n\n====Software====\nThe register mapping of the PCjr's video hardware is different from the standard CGA card, so software that tries to modify or read registers directly will not work\u2014the PCjr has a \"gate\" register in which the user writes the number of the video register to be accessed, followed by the value to be written into it.  Alteration of other CRTC registers cannot be assumed to produce the same results from the PCjr video system as from the CGA (and might damage the monitor).  (Programs for the CGA that manipulate the CRTC start address and that rely on address wrap-around above address 0xBC000 may not work correctly on the PCjr, because it always has a 32&nbsp;KB contiguous block of RAM in the video area from address 0xB8000 through 0xBFFFF.) The PCjr's video memory cannot be moved above 128k if expansion memory is added; some PC software that ran off of self-booting disks (mainly games) would not work on a PCjr if the software required more than 128k.\n\nPC DOS 2.10 was the minimum version of DOS required for the PCjr; IBM's OEM versions of MS-DOS supported the machine up to DOS 3.30, but memory expansion was required for DOS 3.20 and 3.30.\n\n====Hardware====\nThe PCjr display hardware consists primarily of two chips on the system board: a standard Motorola 6845 CRTC like the one used in the MDA and CGA adapters, and a custom IBM chip called the [[Video Gate Array]] (VGA)<ref name=\"vga\">VGA should not be confused with the later [[Video Graphics Array]] standard that IBM released with the [[PS/2]] line in 1987.</ref>{{r|nortonpcjrvideo19840124}}  The 6845 is responsible for the basic raster timing and video data address sequencing, and the Video Gate Array contains all the additional timing logic, the video data demultiplexing and color processing logic, and the programmable palette table logic, as well as the logic for multiplexing RAM access between the 8088 CPU and the video generation circuitry.  The 6845 CRTC and the VGA together are completely responsible for refreshing the internal DRAM of the PCjr (64 or 128&nbsp;KB), and this complicates the process of switching video modes on the PCjr.  (Resetting the VGA, which must be done during certain video mode switches, must be done by code not running from the internal RAM, and if the CRTC or the VGA is disabled for too long, the contents of the internal RAM can be lost.)  Additional external DRAM, in sidecar expansion modules, is refreshed separately, not by the CRTC and VGA.\n\n[[File:IBM PCB Jr Motherboard.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr Motherboard]]\n\n[[File:IBM PCB Jr Internal.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr Internal]]\n\n====Sound====\nThe PCjr's sound is provided by a [[Texas Instruments]] [[SN76496]] which can produce three square waves of varying amplitude and frequency along with a noise channel powered by a [[shift register]].<ref name=\"nortonpcjraudio19840124\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSzKzjWHeVEC&lpg=PA61&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Sound Abilities: The PCjr | work=PC Magazine | date=January 24, 1984 | accessdate=October 23, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=137}}</ref> This device is sometimes also called a PSG (Programmable Sound Generator), and essentially equivalent devices were also used in the contemporary [[Sega Master System]] and the later [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]]. The PCjr design also allows for an analog sound source in an expansion-bus \"sidecar\" module, and software-controlled internal analog switch can select the source for the sound output from among the PC speaker, the SN76489, the cassette port, or the expansion-bus sound source.  Only one sound source can be selected at a time; the sources cannot be mixed.\n\n====Processor speed====\nThe PCjr's 4.77&nbsp;MHz [[Intel 8088]] [[CPU]] is faster than that of other computers that were aimed at the home market at the time,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} though the stock PCjr usually does not run at the full rated 4.77&nbsp;MHz because access to the internal RAM is slowed by [[wait state]]s added by the Video Gate Array to synchronize shared access to RAM between the CPU and the video hardware. IBM claimed that an average of two wait states are added, but the designers of the Tandy 1000 claimed that six was a more accurate figure.<ref name=\"vose198412\">{{Cite magazine |last=Vose |first=G. Michael |date=December 1984 |title=The Tandy 1000 |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n99/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |pages=98\u2013104}}</ref> However, this does not apply to programs or data located in ROM, including software on ROM cartridges plugged into the front of the PCjr, or located in additional RAM in a sidecar attachment; it only applies to the first 64 KB or 128 KB of RAM inside the system unit.  Therefore, under some circumstances the 8088 in the PCjr actually can run at the rated 4.77&nbsp;MHz.  The most common instances in which this maximum speed would be achieved are when running games or productivity applications from ROM cartridges; this would be a reason for PCjr users to prefer software in cartridges to software on disk media.  In fact, because the PCjr video subsystem continuously refreshes the system internal DRAM transparently, without disturbing the CPU, programs running from ROM on the PCjr will actually run slightly faster on the PCjr than on an IBM PC or XT.  This is because the PC and XT keep their DRAM refreshed by using a DMA channel to periodically request the bus from the CPU in order to perform a refresh cycle, whereas a program running from ROM on a PCjr will never be suspended for internal DRAM refresh cycles. To increase the system-speed of the IBM PCjr you can install a [[NEC V20]] instead of the 8088.\n\n====Wireless keyboard====\nThe detached wireless infrared keyboard promised a degree of convenience none of its competitors had, eliciting visions of word processing wirelessly from one's [[couch]] with the computer connected to a TV set as a display.{{r|hoffmann198403}}  For infrared wireless operation, it was powered by four common AA cells.  A keyboard cord option, that plugged into the keyboard with a modular 4-position telephone plug and into the back of the computer with a 6-pin (2x3) header connected, was also available for increased security and reliability. The cord also eliminated dependence on batteries; the keyboard IR receiver was automatically disabled when the keyboard cord was attached to the computer.\n\n===Differences from the IBM PC===\nWith a built-in [[RF modulator]], the PCjr can send video and audio to a television receiver; it also has an audio output jack to connect to an amplifier. The PCjr Color Display sold by IBM included an internal amplified speaker, being the only IBM monitor in the PC line to do so. [[IBM BASIC#IBM PCjr Cartridge BASIC|Cartridge BASIC]] enhances the standard IBM BASIC with commands to support the new video and audio functionality.<ref name=\"nortonpcjrvideo19840124\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSzKzjWHeVEC&lpg=PA61&pg=PA128#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Screening the PCjr's Color, Video, And Memory Options | work=PC Magazine | date=January 24, 1984 | access-date=October 23, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=128}}</ref>{{r|nortonpcjraudio19840124}} Two joystick ports are also evidence of IBM's goal for marketing the PCjr as a home-friendly machine to compete with popular home machines like the Commodore 64, the Atari home computers, and the Apple II line. Other than the [[Tandy 1000]], which was designed as an enhanced PCjr clone to directly compete with the PCjr, and [[PC1512|Amstrad IBM PC compatible]] lines a few years later, the dual built-in joystick ports introduced by the PCjr never became standard on IBM PC compatibles, and have not been seen since. However, the single 15-pin D-subminiature joystick port common on later PCs supports two two-axis, two-button joysticks like those supported by the PCjr, and the 15-pin port can be split out to two separate joystick ports with a passive Y-adapter cable.\n\nFurther reinforcing the \"home-friendly\" goal, the PCjr also introduced two [[ROM cartridge]] slots on the front of the unit, meant to load software quickly and easily. The cartridges are plugged in from the front, prompting the computer to automatically reboot and run the software. This is more [[Usability|user-friendly]] than other home computer systems, which must be powered off when a cartridge was removed or inserted and come with warnings about damage to the computer if this requirement is ignored. Loading and saving data from cartridge software is possible via the floppy drive. The cartridge BASIC for the PCjr, in particular, gives programmers the advantage of a real programming language always ready without taking up system memory, as it was firmware, with its own address space. Being stored in ROM the BASIC loads very quickly, not needing access to the floppy disk or other storage.\n\nCartridges can also replace the system BIOS and other firmware.<ref name=\"norton19840320\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1tFFnOMCvv4C&lpg=PA477&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Unearthing The PCjr's Secrets | work=PC Magazine | date=March 20, 1984 | access-date=October 24, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=111}}</ref> A number of patches from various vendors are included on a single \"combo-cartridge\", licensed and sold by PC Enterprises, to support add-on hardware, bypass certain limitations of design, and keep up with changing OS requirements.\n\nExpansions (such as additional parallel ports, serial ports, memory, etc.) to the PCjr are provided via add-on [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|\"sidecars\" that attach to the side of the PCjr]]. Multiple expansions are stacked together, increasing the width of the machine.\n\nThe floppy controller on the PCjr had its I/O registers mapped into different ports than on the PC, since the PCjr also did not have DMA, the BIOS routines for handling floppy access were different and more complex than those on the PC. Software that tried to perform direct, low-level disk access (mainly utilities, but also the occasional game such as ''Dunzhin: Warrior of Ras'') would not work unless it was rewritten for the PCjr.\n\nThe internal floppy drive on the PCjr was a half-height [[Qume]] 5.25\" unit; IBM also used these drives in the PC Portable, but the PCjr units were specially equipped with a small fan to prevent overheating since the computer did not have a case fan.\n\nThe PCjr's video uses 32&nbsp;kB of RAM as [[shared graphics memory]], which prevents using additional memory with the built-in 128&nbsp;KB under DOS.{{r|norton19840320}}  The specific issue is that while additional external RAM can be added directly above the internal RAM, making a [[flat memory model|flat model]], if the display is used, its buffer must reside somewhere within the first 128&nbsp;KB of RAM (from where it is mirrored at address 0xB8000).  Stock MS-DOS is not prepared to work around the video buffer in low RAM, using RAM both below and above it.  Two obvious solutions exist: Use the additional memory as a [[RAM drive]], or not use the built-in 128&nbsp;KB.<ref name=\"norton19840626\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGkuDrOYjOcC&lpg=PA407&pg=PA98#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Adding to Junior's Memory | work=PC Magazine | date=June 26, 1984 | access-date=October 24, 2013 | author=Norton, Peter | pages=98}}</ref>  Another option would be to load a special DOS device driver or TSR, which would claim the RAM selected for use as the video buffer, causing DOS to load other drivers and programs above it.  A fourth option would be not to use MS-DOS, or to use a specially modified version of it.  For programs running from ROM cartridges, not using DOS was a very viable option, even in the mid-1980s when the PCjr was being marketed.\n[[File:IBM PC Jr BASIC Cartridge.jpg|thumb|IBM PC Jr BASIC Cartridge]]\n\n===Differences from other personal computers===\nThe PCjr initially shipped with a wireless [[chiclet keyboard]] called the \"Freeboard\",<ref name=\"halfhill198410\"/> powered by four AA batteries to provide infrared line-of-sight wireless communication.

It was reprinted again the next year by Welles Brothers and Company. It was issued again in 1915 and 1917, when it was enlarged to 7 volumes, the last being a reading and study guide). In 1922 it was published in 10 volumes, the last two being a study guide. This was published under the imprint of the [[Standard Education Society]]. It was this edition that brought the attention of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] who issued a Cease and Desist Order for misrepresentation in 1923 (Docket #994).<ref>Walsh p.159</ref> As a result, in 1923 the set was reprinted as the ''National Encyclopedia for the Home, School and Library'' in 10 volumes under the [[National Encyclopedia Company]] imprint.

Brazilwood trees, source of a brilliant red dye, grew in abundance on the Atlantic coast of Brazil, and were the chief trading commodity of precolonial and early colonial times.\n\n==Prehistory and Antiquity==\nThe Brazilian northeast has some of the most ancient arqueological sites of the country, which date more than 40,000 years BCE.

The captaincy of Pernambuco originally stretched for 60 [[league (unit)|league]]s between the [[Igara\u00e7u River, Pernambuco]] and the [[S\u00e3o Francisco River]], and was called [[Captaincy of Pernambuco|New Lusitania]].\n\nCoelho Pereira, an influential navigator and soldier, directed military actions against the French-allied [[Caet\u00e9 people|Caet\u00e9s]] Indians and, upon their defeat in 1537, established a settlement at the site of a former Marin Indian village, henceforth known as [[Olinda]], as well as at another village Igara\u00e7u, at the Igara\u00e7u River. In addition, he started the cultivation of sugar-cane, which would have an important role in the economic history of the colony. Coelho Pereira took responsibility for most of the production of sugar, the so-called \"white gold\", in America and made New Lusitania one of the most flourishing captaincies.\n\nDuring the [[Colonial Brazil|Colonial Period]] for centuries the [[captaincy]] of Pernambuco was the most prominent of Brazil, due to growing of sugar-cane. The importance and influence of the then captaincy had become evident as early as the mid-1550s, when the governor-general [[Martim Afonso de Sousa|Sousa]] oversaw all of the captaincies of the colony, except that of Pernambuco, by the requirement of its donee [[Duarte Coelho Pereira|Duarte Coelho]].\nDue to the cultivation of [[sugar cane|sugar]], Pernambuco had become one of the few prosperous captaincies (the other notable one being [[Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente|S\u00e3o Vicente]]). In 1612, Pernambuco produced 14,000 tons of sugar; in the 1640s, more than 24,000 tons of sugar were exported to [[Amsterdam]] alone. While the sugar industry relied at first on the labor of indigenous peoples, especially the [[Tupis]] and [[Tapuyas]], high mortality and economic growth led to the importation of African slaves from the late 17th century. Some of these slaves escaped the sugar-producing coastal regions and formed independent inland communities called [[mocambos]], including [[Palmares (quilombo)|Palmares]].\n\nIn 1595 the captaincy suffered a severe blow. The English [[privateer]] [[James Lancaster]], after picking up a chance-met separate squadron under [[Sir Henry Middleton|Captain Henry Middleton]], led an assault landing, [[Capture of Recife (1595)|seized the town of Recife]] and (with the assistance of a flotilla of Dutch traders who also threw in their lot with him) held it for several weeks, sailing away with the cargo of an East Indian carrack along with local plunder such as Brazil-wood.{{relevance inline|date=January 2014}}\n\n==Pernambuco and Northeastern Brazil in the golden age of Dutch exploration and discovery==\n{{main| Dutch Brazil}}\n[[File:Flag of New Holland.svg|thumb|200 px | left | Dutch Brazil flag]]\nIn February 1630 the Flemish fleet sighted Pernambuco and landed on the shore of [[Paulista|Pau Amarelo]].

It is usually reported by over 70% of patients, and it is typically mild-to-moderate in intensity. Given the impact on quality of life and night sleep, pruritus is correlated with fatigue.

In the new system of Nakanuma, the stage of disease is based on fibrosis, bile duct loss and features of cholate-stasis, i.e. deposition of orcein-positive granules, whereas the grade of necroinflammatory activity is based on cholangitis and interface hepatitis. The accumulation of orcein-positive granules occurs evenly across the PBC liver, which means that staging using the Nakanuma system is more reliable regarding sampling variability.\n\nLiver biopsy for the diagnosis and staging of PBC lost favour after the evidence of a patchy distribution of the duct lesions and fibrosis across the organ. The widespread availability of non-invasive measures of fibrosis means that liver biopsy for staging of PBC is somewhat obsolete. \nLiver biopsy does, however, remain useful in certain settings. The main indications are to confirm the diagnosis of PBC when PBC-specific antibodies are absent and confirm a diagnosis of PBC with AIH features (i.e. overlap PBC-AIH). Liver biopsy is also useful to assess the relative contribution of each liver injury when a comorbid liver disease is present, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In patients with inadequate response to UDCA, liver biopsy may provide the explanation and could undoubtedly inform risk stratification. For example, it may identify a previously unsuspected variant syndrome, steatohepatitis, or interface hepatitis of moderate or greater severity. It is also useful in AMA and ANA-specific antibody negative cholestatic patients to indicate an alternative process, e.g. sarcoidosis, small duct PSC, adult idiopathic ductopenia.\n\n==Histopathology stages (by Ludwig and Scheuer systems)==\n*''Stage 1 \u2013 Portal Stage'': Normal sized triads; portal inflammation, subtle [[bile duct]] damage. [[Granulomas]] are often detected in this stage.\n*''Stage 2 \u2013 Periportal Stage'': Enlarged triads; periportal [[fibrosis]] and/or [[inflammation]]. Typically characterized by the finding of a proliferation of small bile ducts.\n*''Stage 3 \u2013 Septal Stage'': Active and/or passive fibrous septa.\n*''Stage 4 \u2013 Biliary Cirrhosis'': Nodules present; garland or jigsaw puzzle pattern.\n\n==Treatment==\nMedical therapy of PBC targets disease progression and symptom control. The backbone of treatment of PBC is bile acid. UDCA has been the only drug available for two decades and more recently obeticholic acid (OCA), a semi-synthetic hydrophobic bile acid analogue, has been licensed in patients failing UDCA response or intolerant to UDCA.

Improvement of diagnostic tools, increasing disease awareness, and digitalized patient registration with easing of case-findings, along with an improved survival likely contributed to the rising prevalence rates. \nThe disease has been described worldwide, even though North America and Northern Europe have shown the highest incidence and prevalence rates.

Ahrens et al. in 1950 published the first detailed description of 17 patients with this condition and coined the term \u201cprimary biliary cirrhosis\u201d. In 1959, Dame Sheila Sherlock reported a further series of PBC patients and recognised that the disease could be diagnosed in a pre-cirrhotic stage and proposed the term \u201cchronic intrahepatic cholestasis\u201d as more appropriate description of this disease. However, this nomenclature failed to gain acceptance and the term \u201cprimary biliary cirrhosis\u201d lasted for decades. In 2014, to correct the inaccuracy and remove the social stigmata of cirrhosis as well as all the misunderstanding, disadvantages and discrimination emanating from this misnomer in daily life for patients, international liver associations agreed to rename the disease \u201cprimary biliary cholangitis\u201d, as it is known nowadays.<ref name=\"pmid12500211\">{{cite journal| author=Reuben A| title=The serology of the Addison-Gull syndrome. | journal=Hepatology | year= 2003 | volume= 37 | issue= 1 | pages= 225\u20138 | pmid=12500211 | doi=10.1002/hep.510370134 | pmc= }}</ref>.<ref name=DNS/> <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker JG, Doniach D, Roitt IM, Sherlock S | title = Serological Tests in Diagnosis of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 7390 | pages = 827\u201331 | date = April 1965 | pmid = 14263538 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(65)91372-3}}</ref> <ref name=Mitchison1986>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitchison HC, Bassendine MF, Hendrick A, Bennett MK, Bird G, Watson AJ, James OF | title = Positive Antimitochondrial Antibody but Normal Alkaline Phosphatase: Is this Primary Biliary Cirrhosis? | journal = Hepatology | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 1279\u20131284 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3793004 | doi = 10.1002/hep.1840060609 | displayauthors = 3 }}</ref>\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Support groups===\n\n====PBC Foundation====\nThe PBC Foundation is a UK-based international charity offering support and information to people with PBC, their families and friends.<ref name=\"AMRC\">{{cite web|last1=Association of Medical Research Charities|title=The PBC Foundation|url=http://www.amrc.org.uk/our-members/member-directory/the-pbc-foundation|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>  It campaigns for increasing recognition of the disorder, improved diagnosis and treatments, and estimates over 8000 people are undiagnosed in the UK.<ref name=Scotsman2008/><ref>{{cite journal|author= Thain, Collette |journal = At Home Magazine| format = online | year = 2015 | title=Primary Biliary Cirrhosis: Getting a Diagnosis|url=http://www.athomemagazine.co.uk/primary-biliary-cirrhosis-getting-a-diagnosis/|accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref>  The Foundation has supported research into PBC including the development of the PBC-40 [[quality of life]] measure published in 2004<ref name=\"pmid15961522\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacoby A, Rannard A, Buck D, Bhala N, Newton JL, James OF, Jones DE | title = Development, Validation, and Evaluation of the PBC-40, a Disease Specific Health-Related Quality of Life Measure for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis | journal = Gut | volume = 54 | issue = 11 | pages = 1622\u20131629 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 15961522 | pmc = 1774759 | doi = 10.1136/gut.2005.065862 | displayauthors = 3 }}</ref> and helped establish the PBC Genetics Study.<ref name = \"Liu_2012\"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mells GF, Floyd JA, Morley KI, Cordell HJ, Franklin CS, Shin SY, Heneghan MA, Neuberger JM, Donaldson PT, Day DB, Ducker SJ, Muriithi AW, Wheater EF, Hammond CJ, Dawwas MF, Jones DE, Peltonen L, Alexander GJ, Sandford RN, Anderson CA | title = Genome-Wide Association study Identifies 12 New Susceptibility Loci for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 329\u2013332 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21399635 | pmc = 3071550 | doi = 10.1038/ng.789 | displayauthors = 3 }}</ref> It was founded by Collette Thain in 1996, after she was diagnosed with the condition.<ref name=Scotsman2008>Staff of The Scotsman, January 3, 2008.

It is usually reported by over 70% of patients, and it is typically mild-to-moderate in intensity. Given the impact on quality of life and night sleep, pruritus is correlated with fatigue. It can rarely be severe, non-responsive to medical therapy and requiring liver transplant.

In the new system of Nakanuma, the stage of disease is based on fibrosis, bile duct loss and features of cholate-stasis, i.e. deposition of orcein-positive granules, whereas the grade of necroinflammatory activity is based on cholangitis and interface hepatitis. The accumulation of orcein-positive granules occurs evenly across the PBC liver, which means that staging using the Nakanuma system is more reliable regarding sampling variability.\n\nLiver biopsy for the diagnosis and staging of PBC lost favour after the evidence of a patchy distribution of the duct lesions and fibrosis across the organ. The widespread availability of non-invasive measures of fibrosis means that liver biopsy for staging of PBC is somewhat obsolete. \nLiver biopsy does, however, remain useful in certain settings. The main indications are to confirm the diagnosis of PBC when PBC-specific antibodies are absent and confirm a diagnosis of PBC with AIH features (i.e. overlap PBC-AIH). Liver biopsy is also useful to assess the relative contribution of each liver injury when a comorbid liver disease is present, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In patients with inadequate response to UDCA, liver biopsy may provide the explanation and could undoubtedly inform risk stratification. For example, it may identify a previously unsuspected variant syndrome, steatohepatitis, or interface hepatitis of moderate or greater severity. It is also useful in AMA and ANA-specific antibody negative cholestatic patients to indicate an alternative process, e.g. sarcoidosis, small duct PSC, adult idiopathic ductopenia.\n\n==Histopathology stages (by Ludwig and Scheuer systems)==\n*''Stage 1 \u2013 Portal Stage'': Normal sized triads; portal inflammation, subtle [[bile duct]] damage. [[Granulomas]] are often detected in this stage.\n*''Stage 2 \u2013 Periportal Stage'': Enlarged triads; periportal [[fibrosis]] and/or [[inflammation]]. Typically characterized by the finding of a proliferation of small bile ducts.\n*''Stage 3 \u2013 Septal Stage'': Active and/or passive fibrous septa.\n*''Stage 4 \u2013 Biliary Cirrhosis'': Nodules present; garland or jigsaw puzzle pattern.\n\n==Treatment==\nMedical therapy of PBC targets disease progression and symptom control. The backbone of treatment of PBC is bile acid. UDCA has been the only drug available for two decades and more recently obeticholic acid (OCA), a semi-synthetic hydrophobic bile acid analogue, has been licensed in patients failing UDCA response or intolerant to UDCA. Several other agents have been studied, including immunosuppressants, but robust evidence of benefit is lacking.<ref name=\"pmid=19554543\"/><ref name=\"pmid12628068\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy C, Lindor KD | title = Treatment Options for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis | journal = Current Treatment Options in Gastroenterology | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 93\u2013103 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12628068 | doi = 10.1007/s11938-003-0010-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid15456326\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Oo YH, Neuberger J | title = Options for treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis | journal = Drugs | volume = 64 | issue = 20 | pages = 2261\u20132271 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15456326 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200464200-00001 }}</ref>\n\n* [[Ursodeoxycholic acid]] (UDCA), marketed as Ursodiol, Ursobil and others, has been shown to improve the liver biochemistry, slow down histological progression and improve LT-free survival.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Rudic|first=Jelena S.|last2=Poropat|first2=Goran|last3=Krstic|first3=Miodrag N.|last4=Bjelakovic|first4=Goran|last5=Gluud|first5=Christian|date=2012-12-12|title=Ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=12|pages=CD000551|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000551.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=23235576}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid=19554543\"/>.

Fibrates are licensed for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. They also exert potent anticholestatic effects.

Such figures, in particular the prevalence, have shown some increasing in the last decades. Improvement of diagnostic tools, increasing disease awareness, and digitalized patient registration with easing of case-findings, along with an improved survival likely contributed to the rising prevalence rates. \nThe disease has been described worldwide, even though North America and Northern Europe have shown the highest incidence and prevalence rates. It is not clear whether there is a true variation in disease prevalence among populations of different geographical areas and of different ethnicity or if this is a consequence of a difference in study quality. <ref name=\"pmid22245904\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Boonstra K, Beuers U, Ponsioen CY |title=Epidemiology of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and Primary Biliary Cirrhosis: A Systematic Review |journal=Journal of Hepatology |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=1181\u20131188 |year=2012 |pmid=22245904 |doi=10.1016/j.jhep.2011.10.025 |url=}}</ref> <ref name=\"pmid10421645\">{{cite journal |vauthors=James OF, Bhopal R, Howel D, Gray J, Burt AD, Metcalf JV |title=Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Once Rare, Now Common in the United Kingdom? |journal=Hepatology |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=390\u2013394 |year=1999 |pmid=10421645 |doi=10.1002/hep.510300213 |url= | displayauthors = 3 }}</ref> PBC is more common in women, with a female:male ratio of at least 9:1.

Major defects of sex chromosomes, i.e. enhanced monosomy X in female patients and an enhanced Y chromosome loss in male patients, have been described and might well explain the greater female predisposition to develop PBC. <ref name=\"pmid  14975617\">{{cite journal | vauthors= Invernizzi P, Miozzo M, Battezzati PM, Bianchi I, Grati FR, Simoni G, Selmi C, Watnik M, Gershwin ME, Podda M | title=Frequency of monosomy X in women with primary biliary cirrhosis | journal=Lancet| date=February 2004 | volume=14 | issue = 363 | pages=533-535|pmid=14975617}}</ref>\n\n\n\nEven though there are case reports of patients diagnosed at the age of 15 or 93, the typical disease onset is between 30 and 60 years.

Ahrens et al. in 1950 published the first detailed description of 17 patients with this condition and coined the term \u201cprimary biliary cirrhosis\u201d. In 1959, Dame Sheila Sherlock reported a further series of PBC patients and recognised that the disease could be diagnosed in a pre-cirrhotic stage and proposed the term \u201cchronic intrahepatic cholestasis\u201d as more appropriate description of this disease. However, this nomenclature failed to gain acceptance and the term \u201cprimary biliary cirrhosis\u201d lasted for decades. In 2014, to correct the inaccuracy and remove the social stigmata of cirrhosis as well as all the misunderstanding, disadvantages and discrimination emanating from this misnomer in daily life for patients, international liver associations agreed to rename the disease \u201cprimary biliary cholangitis\u201d, as it is known nowadays.<ref name=\"pmid12500211\">{{cite journal| author=Reuben A| title=The serology of the Addison-Gull syndrome. | journal=Hepatology | year= 2003 | volume= 37 | issue= 1 | pages= 225\u20138 | pmid=12500211 | doi=10.1002/hep.510370134 | pmc= }}</ref>.<ref name=DNS/> <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker JG, Doniach D, Roitt IM, Sherlock S | title = Serological Tests in Diagnosis of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 7390 | pages = 827\u201331 | date = April 1965 | pmid = 14263538 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(65)91372-3}}</ref> <ref name=Mitchison1986>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitchison HC, Bassendine MF, Hendrick A, Bennett MK, Bird G, Watson AJ, James OF | title = Positive Antimitochondrial Antibody but Normal Alkaline Phosphatase: Is this Primary Biliary Cirrhosis? | journal = Hepatology | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 1279\u20131284 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3793004 | doi = 10.1002/hep.1840060609 | displayauthors = 3 }}</ref>\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Support groups===\n\n====PBC Foundation====\nThe PBC Foundation is a UK-based international charity offering support and information to people with PBC, their families and friends.<ref name=\"AMRC\">{{cite web|last1=Association of Medical Research Charities|title=The PBC Foundation|url=http://www.amrc.org.uk/our-members/member-directory/the-pbc-foundation|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>  It campaigns for increasing recognition of the disorder, improved diagnosis and treatments, and estimates over 8000 people are undiagnosed in the UK.<ref name=Scotsman2008/><ref>{{cite journal|author= Thain, Collette |journal = At Home Magazine| format = online | year = 2015 | title=Primary Biliary Cirrhosis: Getting a Diagnosis|url=http://www.athomemagazine.co.uk/primary-biliary-cirrhosis-getting-a-diagnosis/|accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref>  The Foundation has supported research into PBC including the development of the PBC-40 [[quality of life]] measure published in 2004<ref name=\"pmid15961522\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacoby A, Rannard A, Buck D, Bhala N, Newton JL, James OF, Jones DE | title = Development, Validation, and Evaluation of the PBC-40, a Disease Specific Health-Related Quality of Life Measure for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis | journal = Gut | volume = 54 | issue = 11 | pages = 1622\u20131629 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 15961522 | pmc = 1774759 | doi = 10.1136/gut.2005.065862 | displayauthors = 3 }}</ref> and helped establish the PBC Genetics Study.<ref name = \"Liu_2012\"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mells GF, Floyd JA, Morley KI, Cordell HJ, Franklin CS, Shin SY, Heneghan MA, Neuberger JM, Donaldson PT, Day DB, Ducker SJ, Muriithi AW, Wheater EF, Hammond CJ, Dawwas MF, Jones DE, Peltonen L, Alexander GJ, Sandford RN, Anderson CA | title = Genome-Wide Association study Identifies 12 New Susceptibility Loci for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 329\u2013332 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21399635 | pmc = 3071550 | doi = 10.1038/ng.789 | displayauthors = 3 }}</ref> It was founded by Collette Thain in 1996, after she was diagnosed with the condition.<ref name=Scotsman2008>Staff of The Scotsman, January 3, 2008.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 26th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is directed by [[Destin Daniel Cretton]] from a screenplay by [[David Callaham]] and stars [[Simu Liu]] as Shang-Chi, alongside [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] and [[Awkwafina]].\n\nA film based on Shang-Chi has been in development since 2001, but work did not begin in earnest on the project until 2018 with the hiring of Callaham. Cretton joined in early 2019, with the project fast-tracked to be Marvel's first film with an Asian lead. The film's title and primary cast were announced that July, revealing the film's connection to the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]] (Leung) and his Ten Rings organization that appear throughout the MCU. Filming began in February 2020, with locations including Australia and Los Angeles. The production was put on hold in March due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on May 7, 2021.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Simu Liu by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Simu Liu at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n* [[Simu Liu]] as [[Shang-Chi]]: A skilled martial artist.<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" />\n* [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] as the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]]:<br />The leader of the Ten Rings terrorist organization.

We are not looking to contribute anymore to the Asian stereotypes that we have seen both in cinema and pop culture... [Leung] is such an incredible actor and I'm excited to have him help us break some of those stereotypes\".<ref name=\"ObserverSept2019\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Awkwafina]] has been cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAccording to [[Margaret Loesch]], former President and CEO of [[Marvel Productions]], [[Stan Lee]] discussed a potential [[Shang-Chi]] film or television series with actor [[Brandon Lee]] and his mother [[Linda Lee Cadwell|Linda Lee]] during the 1980s, with the intention of having Brandon Lee star as the character in such a project.<ref name=\"BrandonLee\" /> Brandon's father, martial arts legend [[Bruce Lee]], was the visual inspiration for artist [[Paul Gulacy]] when drawing Shang-Chi during his tenure on the ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Master of Kung Fu]]'' comic book series in the 1970s.<ref name=\"CBA7\" /> In 2001, [[Stephen Norrington]] announced his intentions to direct a Shang-Chi film entitled ''The Hands of Shang-Chi''.<ref name=\"BloodyDisgusting\" /> By 2003, the film was in development at [[DreamWorks Pictures]] with [[Yuen Woo-Ping]] replacing Norrington as director and [[Bruce C. McKenna]] hired to write the screenplay.<ref name=\"Dreamworks\" /> [[Ang Lee]] joined the project as a producer in 2004, but the film did not materialize after that point and the rights to the character reverted to Marvel.<ref name=\"NorringtonLee\" /> In September 2005, Marvel chairman and CEO [[Avi Arad]] announced Shang-Chi as one of ten properties being developed as films by the newly formed studio [[Marvel Studios]],<ref name=\"IGNSept05\" /> after the fledgling company received financing to produce the slate of ten films which were to be distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name=\"10Films\" />\n\nBy December 2018, Marvel had fast-tracked development of a Shang-Chi film with the intent of making it their first film with an Asian lead. Marvel hired Chinese-American writer [[David Callaham]] to write the screenplay, and began looking at Asian and Asian-American filmmakers to potentially direct the film. The studios' goal was to explore \"Asian and Asian-American themes, crafted by Asian and Asian-American filmmakers\", as they had done for African and African-American culture with ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' earlier in 2018.<ref name=\"Callaham\" /> Development of the film also came following the success of the film ''[[Crazy Rich Asians (film)|Crazy Rich Asians]]'', also released earlier in 2018, which led to several other Asian-led properties being developed by Hollywood studios.<ref name=\"Callaham2\" /> Callaham's script was expected to modernize elements of the character's comic book story, which was first written in the 1970s, to avoid what modern audiences would consider to be negative stereotypes.<ref name=\"Callaham\" /> Richard Newby of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said the film could \"break out in a way similar to ''Black Panther''\" by bringing a new perspective to the character. Newby felt Shang-Chi could have worked well as a television series, and said it \"speaks volumes\" that Marvel would decide to make a feature film about the character instead. Newby concluded that the film is an opportunity to avoid stereotypes about Asian martial artists and be \"more than Marvel's Bruce Lee\".<ref name=\"THRNewbyDec2018\" />\n\nMarvel Studios hired Japanese-American filmmaker [[Destin Daniel Cretton]] to direct the film in March 2019. [[Deborah Chow]]\u2014who previously directed episodes of Marvel's ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'' and ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'' television series\u2014Justin Tipping, and [[Alan Yang]] were also considered.<ref name=\"THRCrettonMarch2019\" /> In April, Marvel Studios and Australian [[Minister for the Arts (Australia)|Arts Minister]] [[Mitch Fifield]] announced that an upcoming Marvel film, believed to be ''Shang-Chi'', would be filmed at Fox Studios Australia in [[Sydney]] and on location throughout the state of [[New South Wales]]. The production received AU$24 million (US${{To USD|24|AUS|round=yes}} million) in one-off funding from the Australian government, as well as backing from the AU$10 million (US${{To USD|10|AUS|round=yes}} million) \"Made in NSW\" state fund. The production was expected to generate AU$150 million (US${{To USD|150|AUS|round=yes}} million) for the Australian economy as well as 4,700 new jobs, while taking advantage of around 1,200 local businesses.<ref name=\"Sydney\" /> [[Don Harwin]], the [[Minister for the Public Service and Employee Relations, Aboriginal Affairs, and the Arts|New South Wales Arts Minister]], confirmed in July that this film was ''Shang-Chi'' and revealed that it would be produced [[Back-to-back film production|back-to-back]] with Marvel Studios' ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2022); production on ''Shang-Chi'' was set to be completed before work began on ''Love and Thunder'' later in 2020.<ref name=\"NSWThorShangChi\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn mid-July, Marvel began testing actors in their 20s for the role of Shang-Chi. The studio was adamant that actors be of Chinese descent to audition for the character.<ref name=\"KrollCasting\" /> This group included [[Simu Liu]], who tested for the part on July 14 and was officially cast on July 16. This was announced by producer [[Kevin Feige]]  and Cretton at Marvel Studios's [[San Diego Comic-Con]] panel on July 20, where the film's full title was announced to be ''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings''. Feige noted that the Ten Rings organization had appeared throughout the MCU since its introduction in the franchise's first film, ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), and said its leader the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]] would be introduced in this film with [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] in the role; [[Ben Kingsley]] previously portrayed [[Trevor Slattery|an impostor]] posing as the Mandarin in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013). Feige also announced that [[Awkwafina]] would appear in the film.<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /> Filming was expected to begin in November 2019,<ref name=\"LAFilming\" /> but Cretton said in October that production would begin in early 2020.<ref name=\"CrettonOct2019\" /> In December, Feige said the film would feature predominantly Asian cast members.<ref name=\"FeigeAsianCast\" /> A month later, [[Michelle Yeoh]] entered talks for a role in the film, said to be different from [[Aleta Ogord]], who Yeoh portrayed in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"Yeoh\" />\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began in February 2020,<ref name=\"FeigeLATimesMarch2020\" /><ref name=\"CrettonCoronavirus\" /> shooting at [[Fox Studios Australia]] in [[Sydney]] and on location throughout the state of New South Wales.<ref name=\"Sydney\" /> Filming was also expected to take place in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"LAFilming\" /> [[Bill Pope]] serves as cinematographer for the film. Cretton chose Pope because he felt the cinematographer's style could be both naturalistic and heightened, and because of Pope's work on ''[[The Matrix]]'', which Cretton believed had the right tone for an MCU film focused on Asian and Asian-American characters.<ref name=\"CrettonOct2019\" /> On March 12, after studios had started halting production on films due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Cretton decided to have himself [[COVID-19 testing|tested]] for [[Coronavirus disease 2019|coronavirus]] after working closely with people who had potentially been exposed to it.<ref name=\"CrettonCoronavirus\" /><ref name=\"FirstUnitSuspended\" /> This was a precaution due to Cretton having a newborn baby, and he self-isolated himself while awaiting these results;<ref name=\"FirstUnitSuspended\" /> the test later came back negative.<ref name=\"CrettonCoronavirus\" /> With Cretton self-isolating, Marvel temporarily suspended first unit production for the film but intended for second unit and other aspects of the production to continue as normal.<ref name=\"FirstUnitSuspended\" /> On March 13, the rest of the film's production was paused as Disney halted filming on most of its projects.<ref name=\"AllUnitsSuspended\" /> In early April, Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the coronavirus pandemic, moving ''Shang-Chi''{{'}}s release date to May 7, 2021.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings'' is scheduled to be released on May 7, 2021.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" /> It was previously scheduled to be released on February 12, 2021,<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /> the first day of the [[Chinese New Year]],<ref name=\"SCMPReaction\" /> but this was shifted to the May 2021 date because of the coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"10Films\">{{Cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/06/business/fi-marvel6 |title=Marvel to Make Movies Based on Comic Books |last=Vincent |first=Rodger |date=September 6, 2005 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ory848wW?url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/06/business/fi-marvel6 |archive-date=April 16, 2014 |access-date=January 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Callaham\">{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/12/shang-chi-marvel-studios-first-asian-film-superhero-dave-callaham-kevin-feige-black-panther-1202512660/ |title='Shang-Chi' Marvel's First Asian Film Superhero Franchise;

character [[Shang-Chi]]. Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is intended to be [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 26th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is directed by [[Destin Daniel Cretton]] from a screenplay by [[David Callaham]] and stars [[Simu Liu]] as Shang-Chi, alongside [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] and [[Awkwafina]].\n\nA film based on Shang-Chi has been in development since 2001, but work did not begin in earnest on the project until 2018 with the hiring of Callaham. Cretton joined in early 2019, with the project fast-tracked to be Marvel's first film with an Asian lead. The film's title and primary cast were announced that July, revealing the film's connection to the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]] (Leung) and his Ten Rings organization that appear throughout the MCU. Filming began in February 2020, with locations including Australia and Los Angeles. The production was put on hold in March due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on May 7, 2021.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Simu Liu by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Simu Liu at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n* [[Simu Liu]] as [[Shang-Chi]]: A skilled martial artist.<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\"/>\n* [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] as the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]]:<br/>The leader of the Ten Rings terrorist organization.

[Leung] is such an incredible actor and I'm excited to have him help us break some of those stereotypes\".<ref name=\"ObserverSept2019\"/>\n\nAdditionally, [[Awkwafina]] has been cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\"/>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAccording to [[Margaret Loesch]], former President and CEO of [[Marvel Productions]], [[Stan Lee]] discussed a potential [[Shang-Chi]] film or television series with actor [[Brandon Lee]] and his mother [[Linda Lee Cadwell|Linda Lee]] during the 1980s, with the intention of having Brandon Lee star as the character in such a project.<ref name=\"BrandonLee\"/> Brandon's father, martial arts legend [[Bruce Lee]], was the visual inspiration for artist [[Paul Gulacy]] when drawing Shang-Chi during his tenure on the ''[[Master of Kung Fu (comics)|Master of Kung Fu]]'' comic book series in the 1970s.<ref name=\"CBA7\"/> In 2001, [[Stephen Norrington]] announced his intentions to direct a Shang-Chi film entitled ''The Hands of Shang-Chi''.<ref name=\"BloodyDisgusting\"/> By 2003, the film was in development at [[DreamWorks Pictures]] with [[Yuen Woo-Ping]] replacing Norrington as director and [[Bruce C. McKenna]] hired to write the screenplay.<ref name=\"Dreamworks\"/> [[Ang Lee]] joined the project as a producer in 2004, but the film did not materialize after that point and the rights to the character reverted to Marvel.<ref name=\"NorringtonLee\"/> In September 2005, Marvel chairman and CEO [[Avi Arad]] announced Shang-Chi as one of ten properties being developed as films by the newly formed studio [[Marvel Studios]],<ref name=\"IGNSept05\"/> after the fledgling company received financing to produce the slate of ten films which were to be distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name=\"10Films\"/>\n\nBy December 2018, Marvel had fast-tracked development of a Shang-Chi film with the intent of making it their first film with an Asian lead. Marvel hired Chinese-American writer [[David Callaham]] to write the screenplay, and began looking at Asian and Asian-American filmmakers to potentially direct the film. The studios' goal was to explore \"Asian and Asian-American themes, crafted by Asian and Asian-American filmmakers\", as they had done for African and African-American culture with ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' earlier in 2018.<ref name=\"Callaham\"/> Development of the film also came following the success of the film ''[[Crazy Rich Asians (film)|Crazy Rich Asians]]'', also released earlier in 2018, which led to several other Asian-led properties being developed by Hollywood studios.<ref name=\"Callaham2\"/> Callaham's script was expected to modernize elements of the character's comic book story, which was first written in the 1970s, to avoid what modern audiences would consider to be negative stereotypes.<ref name=\"Callaham\"/> Richard Newby of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said the film could \"break out in a way similar to ''Black Panther''\" by bringing a new perspective to the character. Newby felt Shang-Chi could have worked well as a television series, and said it \"speaks volumes\" that Marvel would decide to make a feature film about the character instead. Newby concluded that the film is an opportunity to avoid stereotypes about Asian martial artists and be \"more than Marvel's Bruce Lee\".<ref name=\"THRNewbyDec2018\"/>\n\nMarvel Studios hired Japanese-American filmmaker [[Destin Daniel Cretton]] to direct the film in March 2019. [[Deborah Chow]]\u2014who previously directed episodes of Marvel's ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'' and ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'' television series\u2014Justin Tipping, and [[Alan Yang]] were also considered.<ref name=\"THRCrettonMarch2019\"/> In April, Marvel Studios and Australian [[Minister for the Arts (Australia)|Arts Minister]] [[Mitch Fifield]] announced that an upcoming Marvel film, believed to be ''Shang-Chi'', would be filmed at Fox Studios Australia in [[Sydney]] and on location throughout the state of [[New South Wales]]. The production received AU$24 million (US${{To USD|24|AUS|round=yes}} million) in one-off funding from the Australian government, as well as backing from the AU$10 million (US${{To USD|10|AUS|round=yes}} million) \"Made in NSW\" state fund. The production was expected to generate AU$150 million (US${{To USD|150|AUS|round=yes}} million) for the Australian economy as well as 4,700 new jobs, while taking advantage of around 1,200 local businesses.<ref name=\"Sydney\"/> [[Don Harwin]], the [[Minister for the Public Service and Employee Relations, Aboriginal Affairs, and the Arts|New South Wales Arts Minister]], confirmed in July that this film was ''Shang-Chi'' and revealed that it would be produced [[Back-to-back film production|back-to-back]] with Marvel Studios' ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2022); production on ''Shang-Chi'' was set to be completed before work began on ''Love and Thunder'' later in 2020.<ref name=\"NSWThorShangChi\"/>\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn mid-July, Marvel began testing actors in their 20s for the role of Shang-Chi. The studio was adamant that actors be of Chinese descent to audition for the character.<ref name=\"KrollCasting\"/> This group included [[Simu Liu]], who tested for the part on July 14 and was officially cast on July 16. This was announced by producer [[Kevin Feige]] and Cretton at Marvel Studios's [[San Diego Comic-Con]] panel on July 20, where the film's full title was announced to be ''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings''. Feige noted that the Ten Rings organization had appeared throughout the MCU since its introduction in the franchise's first film, ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), and said its leader the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]] would be introduced in this film with [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] in the role; [[Ben Kingsley]] previously portrayed [[Trevor Slattery|an impostor]] posing as the Mandarin in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013). Feige also announced that [[Awkwafina]] would appear in the film.<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\"/> Filming was expected to begin in November 2019,<ref name=\"LAFilming\"/> but Cretton said in October that production would begin in early 2020.<ref name=\"CrettonOct2019\"/> In December, Feige said the film would feature predominantly Asian cast members.<ref name=\"FeigeAsianCast\"/> A month later, [[Michelle Yeoh]] entered talks for a role in the film, said to be different from [[Aleta Ogord]], who Yeoh portrayed in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"Yeoh\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began in February 2020,<ref name=\"FeigeLATimesMarch2020\"/><ref name=\"CrettonCoronavirus\"/> shooting at [[Fox Studios Australia]] in [[Sydney]] and on location throughout the state of New South Wales.<ref name=\"Sydney\"/> Filming was also expected to take place in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"LAFilming\"/> [[Bill Pope]] serves as cinematographer for the film. Cretton chose Pope because he felt the cinematographer's style could be both naturalistic and heightened, and because of Pope's work on ''[[The Matrix]]'', which Cretton believed had the right tone for an MCU film focused on Asian and Asian-American characters.<ref name=\"CrettonOct2019\"/> On March 12, after studios had started halting production on films due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Cretton decided to have himself [[COVID-19 testing|tested]] for [[Coronavirus disease 2019|coronavirus]] after working closely with people who had potentially been exposed to it.<ref name=\"CrettonCoronavirus\"/><ref name=\"FirstUnitSuspended\"/> This was a precaution due to Cretton having a newborn baby, and he self-isolated himself while awaiting these results;<ref name=\"FirstUnitSuspended\"/> the test later came back negative.<ref name=\"CrettonCoronavirus\"/> With Cretton self-isolating, Marvel temporarily suspended first unit production for the film but intended for second unit and other aspects of the production to continue as normal.<ref name=\"FirstUnitSuspended\"/> On March 13, the rest of the film's production was paused as Disney halted filming on most of its projects.<ref name=\"AllUnitsSuspended\"/> In early April, Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the coronavirus pandemic, moving ''Shang-Chi''{{'}}s release date to May 7, 2021.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings'' is scheduled to be released on May 7, 2021.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\"/> It was previously scheduled to be released on February 12, 2021,<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\"/> the first day of the [[Chinese New Year]],<ref name=\"SCMPReaction\"/> but this was shifted to the May 2021 date because of the coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"Phase4Delay\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"10Films\">{{Cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/06/business/fi-marvel6 |title=Marvel to Make Movies Based on Comic Books |last=Vincent |first=Rodger |date=September 6, 2005 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ory848wW?url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/06/business/fi-marvel6 |archive-date=April 16, 2014 |access-date=January 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Callaham\">{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/12/shang-chi-marvel-studios-first-asian-film-superhero-dave-callaham-kevin-feige-black-panther-1202512660/ |title='Shang-Chi' Marvel's First Asian Film Superhero Franchise;

It is the only organisation recognised by [[Post Office Ltd]] to act on behalf of subpostmasters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/181836/response/452099/attach/5%20/Peter%20Woodthorpe%20FOIA%20Response%2020.11.13.pdf|title=Freedom of Information Request, ref: OOLO - 9CQB3U}}</ref>\n\nThe NFSP has almost 50 branches throughout the UK, separated into 10 geographical regions. Each member is represented by their local Branch Secretary and Regional Secretary; the Board of Non-Executive Directors is made up of serving subpostmasters (each representing a UK region) and three representatives from organisations with a portfolio of post offices (WH Smith, Ryman and SPAR).\n\n==History==\nOn 19 April 1897 a group of up to 90 subpostmasters assembled at the Music Saloon, Wood Street, Wakefield (now the Institute of Literature and Science) to consider forming a national association to \u201cimprove the conditions under which subpostmasters labour and to undertake the advancement of our interests by all legitimate and honourable means\u201d.\n\nThe federation was formed, with Wakefield as its headquarters, and the first conference was held in Nottingham on 11 April 1898.

Each member is represented by their local Branch Secretary and Regional Secretary; the Board of Non-Executive Directors is made up of serving subpostmasters (each representing a UK region) and three representatives from organisations with a portfolio of post offices (WH Smith, Ryman and SPAR).\n\n==History==\nOn 19 April 1897 a group of up to 90 subpostmasters assembled at the Music Saloon, Wood Street, Wakefield (now the Institute of Literature and Science) to consider forming a national association to \u201cimprove the conditions under which subpostmasters labour and to undertake the advancement of our interests by all legitimate and honourable means\u201d.\n\nThe federation was formed, with Wakefield as its headquarters, and the first conference was held in Nottingham on 11 April 1898. The first edition of a monthly newspaper ''The SubPostmaster'' was published on 4 September 1899, and Joseph Ranns, founder and first National President, wrote the inaugural article. The magazine is still published today. In February 1947, the Federation\u2019s headquarters moved to Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex.\n\nOriginally a trade union, the status of the NFSP was called into question by the requirement that a trade union\u2019s members must meet the legal definition of \u2018workers\u2019.\n\n</blockquote>The NFSP\u2019s members were deemed self-employed agents of Post Office Ltd and its status was changed to a trade association on 13 January 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/listings-decision-national-federation-of-sub-postmasters|title=Listings decision: National Federation of Sub-Postmasters|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nfsp.org.uk NFSP website]\n\n[[Category:Defunct trade unions of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1897 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Postal trade unions]]\n[[Category:Trade unions established in 1897]]\n\n\n{{UK-trade-union-stub}}\n{{UK-org-stub}}\n", "name_user": "MrConspiracyTheory", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_SubPostmasters"}
