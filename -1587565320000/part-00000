The territory of the County of Holland corresponds roughly with the current provinces of [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]] in the [[Netherlands]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe oldest sources refer to the not clearly defined county as ''[[Frisia]]'', west of the [[Vlie]] (also known as [[West Frisia]]). Before 1101, sources talk about Frisian counts, but in this year [[Floris II, Count of Holland]] is mentioned as ''Florentius comes de Hollant'' (Floris, Count of Holland). Holland is probably from the [[Old Dutch]] {{lang|odt|holt lant}}, literally \"wood land\". The counts of Holland generally kept to this single title until 1291, when [[Floris V, Count of Holland]] decided to call himself ''Count of Holland and Zeeland, lord of Friesland''. This title was also used after Holland was united with [[Hainaut (province)|Hainault]], [[Bavaria-Straubing]], and the [[Duchy of Burgundy]]. The titles eventually lost their importance, and the last count, [[Philip II of Spain]], only mentioned them halfway through his long list of titles.\n\n==History==\n\n===Francia and Lotharingia===\nAround 800, under [[Charlemagne]], the [[Frankish Empire]] covered much of Europe. In much of this empire, an important unit of regional administration (corresponding roughly to a [[shire]] or [[county]] in England) was the ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]]'' ([[Frankish language|Frankish]]) or ''[[pagus]]'' (Latin). A ''comes'' ([[count]]) ruled one or more ''gaue''. Because of the low volume of trade, the negative trade balance with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Muslim states and the disappearance of currency, the economy was more-or-less reduced to [[barter]]. The king's [[vassals]] could only be rewarded with land (''beneficium'' or, from the tenth century, ''feodum'') and [[usufruct]]. From this, [[feudalism]] developed. The vassals, who were generally appointed by the king, strove for a system of inheritance. This became more and more the rule, and in 877 it was legalised in the [[Capitulary of Quierzy]].\n\nUpon the death of a king, the Frankish kingdom was frequently divided among his heirs. This [[partible inheritance]] often caused internal strife, which made centralized government problematic. The [[Viking]] raids further undermined centralized government. At the end of the reign of Emperor [[Louis the Pious]], royal power had weakened because of the [[Floods in the Netherlands|flood of 838]] and infighting between the king's sons. After Louis died in 840 his son, Emperor [[Lothair I]] (king of [[Middle Francia]]), rewarded the Danish brothers [[Rorik of Dorestad|Rorik]] and Harald with [[Frisia]] \u2014 present-day [[Holland]] \u2014 in an attempt to resist Viking attacks.\n\nWhen Lothair died in 855, the northern part of Middle Francia was awarded to his second son [[Lothair II]] and was called [[Lotharingia]]. The 880 [[Treaty of Ribemont]] added the Kingdom of Lotharingia (which included the [[Low Countries]]) to [[East Francia]], which attempted to integrate it. However, there were no connections like those between the four German [[Stem duchy|stem duchies]] of east Francia: [[Duchy of Franconia|Franconia]], the [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], the [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]]. Lotharingia had considerable self-determination; this became clear when [[Louis the Child]], East Francia's last [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]], died in 911. Although the stem duchies flocked to Duke [[Conrad I of Germany|Conrad I of Franconia]], Lotharingia chose Carolingian king of [[West Francia]] [[Charles the Simple]].\n\n[[File:Rorik by H. W. Koekkoek.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bearded older man, dressed for battle|Rorik of Dorestad in a 1912 illustration by [[Hermanus Willem Koekkoek]]]]\nIn Frisia, the situation was complex. Power was in the hands of Rorik's successor, [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia|Godfrid]], who became embroiled in the politics of the Frankish empire and was allied with the children of Lothair II. Danish rule ended in 885 with the murder of Godfrid at [[Spijk, Rijnwaarden|Herispijk]], and all Danes east of the coastal areas of [[West Frisia]] were killed or driven out in must have been a complex, successful conspiracy led by [[Henry of Franconia]] in which a coalition of Babenberg Franks, Hamaland Saxons and Teisterbant Frisians (in cooperation with the bishop of Cologne and the emperor) outsmarted Godfrid and the Danes. The chief conspirator in the murder was [[Everard Saxo]], count of [[Hamaland]]. One of those who profited most from the power vacuum was the Frisian [[Gerolf of Holland|Gerolf]], ''comes Fresonum'' (count of Frisia), from [[Westergo]] in the present-day province of [[Friesland]]. Gerolf, Godfrid's former envoy to the emperor, demanded lands in the [[Moselle]] valley from the emperor to provoke a war. After the elimination of a large portion of the Danish population, Gerulf controlled a large Frisian part of the later county of Holland. This ''fait accompli'' was recognised when Gerolf was given lands [[allodial|in full ownership]] on 4 August 889 by the East Frankish king [[Arnulf of Carinthia]], who needed strong warlords in the delta region to keep the Danes and other Vikings out. The lands in question included an area outside Gerulf's county, in Teisterbant, which included [[Tiel]], [[Aalburg]] and [[Asch (Netherlands)|Asch]]. It also involved a forest and field between the mouth of the [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Old Rhine]] (and presumably [[Bennebroek]]), Suithardeshaga, the border between the former Frankish counties of Rijnland and Kennemerland.\n\nKing [[Charles the Simple]] gave the church in [[Egmond (municipality)|Egmond]] and its possessions to Count [[Dirk I, Count of Holland|Dirk I of Holland]] in 922 in gratitude for Dirk's support in the [[Battle of Soissons (923)|Battle of Soissons]] to suppress a rebellion of his West Frankish vassals. The West Frankish king was able to do this because the lands and churches he granted to Dirk were outside his jurisdiction; Egmond was just north of possessions which Dirk had received from Gerulf, and was a good match. He then founded [[Egmond Abbey]], Holland's oldest monastery. When Charles the Simple was deposed in 923, King [[Henry the Fowler]] of East Francia allied with Count [[Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine|Gilbert of Hainaut]] (son of Duke [[Reginar, Duke of Lorraine|Reginar of Lorraine]]) and re-conquered Lotharingia. By 925, the Lotharingian nobles accepted his rule and Lotharingia (with the Frisian lands) became a fifth German stem duchy. Henry's power was limited by his vassal, [[Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine|Gilbert]] (Duke of Lotharingia), whose power was limited to his own counties.\n\n===Imperial State===\n{{History Benelux states}}\nThe rising status of the [[Count of holland#House of Holland|House of Holland]] was shown when in 938 Count [[Dirk II, Count of Holland|Dirk II]], probably the grandson of Count Dirk I, married at the age of 8 with Hildegard of Flanders, daughter of Count [[Arnulf I, Count of Flanders|Arnulf I of Flanders]]. The count of Holland was in this period more of a military commander who had to resist Viking raids, and subject to the authority of the [[Bishopric of Utrecht]]. In 985, King [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]], at the request of his mother [[Theophanu]], granted the ownership (''proprium'') of a number of lands to count Dirk II. These lands had already been given in [[Fief|loan]] (''beneficium''). This was the area between the rivers ''Loira'' or [[De Lier|Lier]] and ''[[Hollandse IJssel|Hisla]]'' (a [[Gau (country subdivision)|gouw]] called [[Maasland|Masaland]]), ''[[Zonnemaire|villa Sunnimeri]]'' (on the Zeelandish island of Schouwen), the area between the rivers ''[[Medemblik|Medemelaka]]'' and ''Chinnelosara gemerchi'' ([[Kennemerland|Kinheim]]) and the gouw [[Texel|Texla]].\n\nIn 993, count [[Arnulf, Count of Holland|Arnulf of Gent]] was killed in a battle against Frisian land reclaimers who did not want to pay their due to the count. It's unknown where this battle took place but it was probably in the Rijnland or in the Maas estuary. Arnulf's son, count [[Dirk III, Count of Holland|Dirk III of Holland]] was too young to rule, so his mother [[Lutgardis of Luxemburg]] acted as regent. In 1005 Dirk was old enough to rule in his own name, but he still made thankful use of the good connections that his mother had made. According to Thietmar of Merseburg a reconciliation with the Frisians was arranged with help from his uncle in-law, king [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]], who travelled with an army and a fleet from [[Utrecht]] to the Maas-estuary (probably [[Vlaardingen]]) to force the inhabitants to recognize their count. This expedition appears to have been successful since after 1005 no revolts against the count in this southern part of the later county of Holland are known.\n\n[[File:Rochussen Egmond.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Dirk VI, Count of Holland]], 1114\u20131157, and his mother Petronella visiting the work on the [[Egmond Abbey]], Charles Rochussen, 1881.]]\n[[File:Caesar van Everdingen Count Willem II of Holland Granting Privileges.jpg|thumb|left|''Count Willem II of Holland Granting Privileges'' by [[Caesar van Everdingen]] and [[Pieter Post]], 1654.]]\nAs a result of a promise he had made during the Frisian rebellion, Dirk III went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. When he returned, the northern side of his county had become unsafe, so he travelled south and started granting rights to reclaim lands from nature around present day [[Vlaardingen]] in order to cultivate this lands. He also built a castle at ''Silva Meriwido'', the future Vlaardingen. From this castle he forced merchants that travelled per ship from [[Tiel]] to England to pay toll. The Bishop of Utrecht, [[Adalbold II of Utrecht|Adalbold]] and the merchants of Tiel complained against this piracy at the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag of Nijmegen]] in 1018, the merchants of Tiel effectively pointing out that the emperor was losing tax revenue when he allowed the Tiel merchants to being plundered by Dirk III. It was decided to act against Dirk III. An army led by [[Godfrey II, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Godfrey II]] Duke of [[Lower Lorraine]], consisting of a fleet with soldiers from the bishops of [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]], [[Archbishop of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai|Cambrai]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge]] was however surprisingly ambushed in a swamp and nearly annihilated by Dirk III Frisian subjects in what was called the [[Battle of Vlaardingen]], Dirk III himself playing a coordinating role, only to appear from his castle to officially take prisoner the duke of Lower Lorraine, when Godfrey was on the verge of being killed.\n\nSo as not to weaken the protection the county of Holland offered against the Viking raids, King Henry II decided to let the matter rest, though he did strengthen the position of the Bishop of Utrecht, the nominal feudal lord of the counts of Holland. Nonetheless Dirk managed to expand his territory to the east at the cost of the Bishopric of Utrecht. After the death of Henry II in 1024, Dirk III supported the candidature of [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] in an attempt to reconcile with the imperial authorities, so as to keep the lands he had acquired, or expand them even further.\n\nEmperor Conrad II died during a stay in Utrecht in 1039 during the rule of bishop [[Bernold]], after which his organs were interred in the [[St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht|Cathedral of Utrecht]]. His son and successor, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], granted numerous favors to the bishopric of Utrecht. In this way, the [[Overijssel#History|Oversticht]] was assigned to the bishopric in 1040. Though the count of Holland had been reconciled with the emperor, Henry III still decided to punish the count. In 1046 the emperor forced [[Dirk IV, Count of Holland|Dirk IV]] to relinquish the lands he had conquered. However, the emperor was not able to maintain himself in the area and was forced to retreat, after which Dirk IV started to raid and plunder the bishoprics of Utrecht and Li\u00e8ge. Moreover, Dirk signed treaties with [[Godfrey III, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Godfrey the Bearded]], duke of Lower Lorraine, as well as the counts of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]]. The Emperor responded with a second punitive expedition in which Vlaardingen and the castle at [[Rijnsburg]] were taken from Dirk IV. The castle was completely destroyed. However, the emperor suffered heavy losses during his retreat, upon which Dirk's allies openly revolted against the emperor. In 1049 Dirk IV was lured into a trap and killed by assassins hired by the bishops of [[Bishopric of Metz|Metz]], Li\u00e8ge and Utrecht. Dirk died young, unmarried and childless. He was succeeded by his brother [[Floris I, Count of Holland|Floris I]].\n\nFloris I managed to expand his territory with a small area within the Rijnland Gouw, an area called ''Holtland'' (\"Woodland\"), or ''Holland''. It is most likely that this name soon became synonymous with Floris' whole territory. In 1061 a war broke out, in which it is not clear whether it was against [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], Utrecht or Li\u00e8ge. During this war Floris was ambushed while relaxing to much and in too small a company when he was raiding in the former Teisterbant county, now Utrechtian territory. He was killed by either Utrechtian or Gueldrian troops. His son [[Dirk V, Count of Holland|Dirk V]] was still a minor, so his mother [[Gertrude of Saxony]] became regent. Gertrude remarried in 1063 with [[Robert I, Count of Flanders|Robert the Frisian]], a younger brother of the [[county of Flanders|count of Flanders]], [[Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders|Baldwin VI]] and a grandson of a former French king, [[Robert II of France|Robert II]], who also acted as regent for Dirk V.\n\nIn 1064, Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] donated lands belonging to the county of Holland, 'west of the [[Vlie]] and around the banks of the Rhine' (the gouw of Westflinge), to [[William I (Bishop of Utrecht)|William, Bishop of Utrecht]], on whose support the Emperor could count. Dirk V was only allowed to keep the gouw of Masaland. Through battles in 1071 and 1072, William of Utrecht, with support from the highly competent Duke [[Godfrey IV, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Godfrey IV]] of Lower Lorraine, managed to gain actual central control over nearly the entire later county of Holland for the first time. Robert the Frisian and Dirk V had to flee to [[Ghent]]. This could have been the end of the Gerulfingian dynasty. Robert the Frisian managed however against some odds to become count of Flanders in 1076 when in the [[Battle of Cassel (1071)|battle of Cassel]] he managed to beat a grand coalition of Hainaut, French and Normandian forces. Being now the count of Flanders he was able to assist his stepson to reclaim the county of Holland. The pair started by taking out their most dangerous adversary. Godfrey IV was killed at night while defecating. Shortly afterwards the formidable bishop William of Utrecht also died. After this Robert I and his stepson Dirk V besieged the new Utrecht/Lotharingian castle at a strategic place at the delta in [[IJsselmonde (Rotterdam)|IJsselmonde]], where the [[Hollandse IJssel]] (still existing) joined the Merwede (not existing any more in the form of 1000 years ago). In the [[battle of IJsselmonde]] they managed to capture the new bishop [[Conrad (Bishop of Utrecht)|Conrad of Swabia]], who was now forced to return the lands to Dirk V's control. In 1101, the name \"Holland\" first appears in a deed.\n\nHolland's influence continued to gradually grow over the next two centuries. The counts of Holland were able to conquer most of [[Zeeland]], to diminish the power of bishops of Utrecht and from the start of the 12th until the 13th century fight a 150 year long war against the inhabitants of the area living at the east side of North Holland, also confusingly known as \"West-Frisians\". It was not until 1289 that Count [[Floris V]] was able to bring this long war to an end and subjugate these West Frisians, this only after the [[St. Lucia's flood]] in 1287 had completely devastated nearly all the lands of the West-Frisians. After this the county was officially known until 1795 as the county of Holland and West Friesland.\n\n===Burgundians and Habsburgs===\n[[File:Holland_1500.PNG|thumb|The County of Holland in the 15th century]]\n[[File:1558 Hollandt v Deventer.jpg|thumb|A 1558 map of Holland.]]\nThe [[Hook and Cod Wars]] were a series of wars and battles in Holland between 1350 and 1490. Most of these wars were fought over the title of count, but some have argued that the underlying reason was because of the power struggle of the [[bourgeois]] in the cities against the ruling nobility. The Cod faction generally consisted of the more progressive cities of [[Holland]]. The Hook faction consisted for a large part of the conservative noblemen. Some of the main figures in this multi-generational conflict were [[William IV, Count of Holland|William IV]], [[Margaret II, Countess of Hainaut|Margaret]], [[William V, Count of Hainaut|William V]], [[William VI, Count of Holland|William VI, Count of Holland and Hainaut]], [[John, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing|John]] and Philip the Good. Perhaps the most well known, however, is [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]]. By the end of the Hook and Cod Wars, [[Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], had taken control of Holland. Leading noblemen in Holland had invited the duke to conquer Holland, even though he had no historical claim to it. Some historians say that the ruling class in Holland wanted Holland to integrate with the [[Flanders|Flemish]] economic system and adopt Flemish legal institutions.\n\nUnder the Burgundians, Holland's trade developed rapidly, especially in the areas of shipping and transport. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests. The fleets of Holland defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. Amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the Baltic region. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital to the people of Holland, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the peat of the former wetlands to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\n[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] (1500\u201358) became the owner in 1506, but in 1515 he left to become king of Spain and later became the Holy Roman Emperor. Charles turned over control to regents (his close relatives), and in practice rule was exercised by mostly French speaking Burgundians he controlled. Holland retained its own governments and court, controlled by the local nobility, and its own traditions and rights (\"liberties\") dating back centuries. Likewise the numerous cities had their own legal rights and local governments, usually controlled by the merchants, On top of this, however, the Burgundians had imposed an overall government, the Estates General of the Netherlands, with its own officials and courts.<ref>H.G. Koenigsberger, \"The Beginnings of the States General of the Netherlands,\" ''Parliaments, Estates and Representation'' (1988) 8#2 pp 101-114.</ref>\n\n===Revolt and the Dutch Republic===\n[[File:Veen01.jpg|thumb|left|The Relief of Leiden by the ''[[Geuzen]]'' in 1574, by [[Otto van Veen]].]]\nDuring the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation]] rapidly gained ground in northern Europe, especially in its Lutheran and Calvinist forms.<ref>R. Po-chia Hsia, ed. ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2006)  pp 118-34</ref> Protestants in Holland, after initial repression, were tolerated by local authorities. By the 1560s, the Protestant community had become a significant influence in the county, although it clearly formed a minority then.<ref>Jonathan I. Israel, ''The Dutch Republic Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (1995) p. 104</ref> In a society dependent on trade, freedom and tolerance were considered essential. Nevertheless, the Catholic rulers Charles V and his successor [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] felt it was their duty to defeat Protestantism, which was considered a heresy by the Catholic Church and a threat to the stability of the whole hierarchical political system.<ref>Hsia, ed. ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2006)  pp 3-36</ref> The Catholic Spanish responded with harsh persecution and introduced the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. Calvinists rebelled. First there was the [[Beeldenstorm|iconoclasm]] in 1566, which was the systematic destruction of statues of saints and other Catholic devotional depictions in churches. After 1566 [[William the Silent]], more or less by accident became the leader of a revolt that by severe mismanagement by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his governor the [[Duke of Alva]] turned in the [[Eighty Years' War]]. As a consequence Holland and the other six allied provinces became an independent nation called the [[Dutch republic|Republic of the Seven United Provinces]]. Over William of Orange Blum says, \"His patience, tolerance, determination, concern for his people, and belief in government by consent held the Dutch together and kept alive their spirit of revolt.\"<ref>Jerome  Blum et al, ''The European World: A History'' (1970) pp 160-61</ref> The main breakthrough came when Holland, along with Zeeland, were conquered in 1572 and following years by the [[Watergeuzen]], a somehow effective maritime force of mainly Calvinists who turned pirate and pirates who turned Calvinist.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477-1806'' (1995) pp 361-95</ref><ref>Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''The Reformation'' (2005) pp 367-72</ref>\n\n[[File:Johannes Lingelbach 001.jpg|thumb|''Dam Square with the New Town Hall under Construction'', by [[Johannes Lingelbach]], 1656.]]\nThe States General of the Netherlands signed the [[Act of Abjuration]], deposing Philip as Count of Holland and forming a confederation between the seven liberated provinces. From then on, the executive and legislative power would again rest with the [[States of Holland and West Friesland]], which were led by a political figure who held the office of [[Grand Pensionary]]. The county, now a sovereign state within this larger confederation, became the cultural, political and economic centre of the [[Dutch Republic]], in the 17th century, the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the wealthiest nation in the world. The largest cities in the republic were situated in the province of Holland, such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Leiden]], [[Alkmaar]], [[Delft]], [[Dordrecht]], [[Haarlem]], and the nation's capital, [[The Hague]]. From the great ports of Holland, Hollandic merchants sailed to and from destinations all over [[Europe]], and merchants from all over Europe gathered to trade in the warehouses of Amsterdam and other trading cities of Holland. Many Europeans thought of the United Provinces first as \"Holland\" rather than as the \"Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands\". A strong impression of \"Holland\" was planted in the minds of other Europeans, which then was projected back onto the Republic as a whole. Within the provinces themselves, a gradual slow process of cultural expansion took place, leading to a \"Hollandification\" of the other provinces and a more uniform culture for the whole of the Republic. In the early decades of the uprising a great number of refugees from Flanders and Brabant settled in the big cities of Holland. They had a [[Francia|Frankish]] influence on the new dialect of urban Holland (that earlier had more Frisian influences) that in later centuries became the [[standard language]] of the Netherlands and Dutch-speaking Belgium.\n\nNominally, the County of Holland formally came to an end in 1795, when the [[Batavian Revolution]] ended the republic and reformed it as the [[Batavian Republic]]. The territory of the former county was divided between the departments of the ''Amstel'', ''Delf'', ''Texel'', and ''Schelde en Maas''. After 1813, Holland was restored as a province of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Holland was divided into the present provinces [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]] in 1840.\n\n==Geography==\nThe county covered an area roughly corresponding to the current Dutch provinces of [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]], as well as the northwestern part of the current province of [[North Brabant]] (roughly between the towns of [[Willemstad, North Brabant|Willemstad]], [[Geertruidenberg]] and [[Werkendam]]), and the islands of [[Terschelling]], [[Vlieland]], [[Urk]] and [[Schokland]], though it did not include the island of [[Goeree-Overflakkee]].\n\nIn the early Middle Ages, large parts of the area covered by the present day Netherlands were covered by [[Bog|peat bogs]]. These bogs limited the size of [[arable land]] in the Netherlands, but also proved to be a good source of fuel. Around 950, small scale reclamation was started on the enormous bogs in Holland and Utrecht, probably set in motion by the minor nobility. In the 11th century the 'Great Reclamation' started, under the control of the counts of Holland and the bishops of Utrecht. Until the 13th century, large amounts of land was reclaimed between the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ bay]] in the north, the dunes in the west, the [[Lek (river)|Lek]] and [[Waal (river)|Waal]] rivers in the south and the [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Old Rhine]] in the east.\n\nBefore the Great Reclamation, the borders between the county of Holland and the bishopric of Utrecht were unclear, and there existed a literal [[no-man's land]]. However, during the reclamation the counts of Holland managed to expand their influence at the cost of Utrecht.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Count of Holland]]\n* [[Counties of the Holy Roman Empire]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |title=Algemene Geschiedenis der Nederlanden |last=Block |first=Dick |year=1977\u20131983 |publisher=Fibula-Van Dishoeck |location=Haarlem |isbn=90-228-3800-5 }}\n*{{cite book |title=Geschiedenis van de Nederlanden |last=Lamberts |first=J.C.H. |year=2006 |publisher=HBuitgevers |location=Baarn |isbn=90-5574-474-3}}\n*{{cite book |title=Oorlog om Holland 1000-1375 |last=Graaf |first=A.C.F. |year=1970 |location=Hilversum |isbn=90-6550-807-4}}\n*{{cite book |title=Oorkondenboek van Holland en Zeeland tot 1299, Deel I - einde 7e eeuw tot 1222 |last=Koch |first=A.C.F. |year=1970 |publisher= Nijhoff |location=Den Haag |isbn=90-247-0403-0}}\n*{{cite book |title=Geschiedenis van Holland tot 1572 |last=Beukers |first=T. de |year=2002 |location=Hilversum |isbn=90-6550-682-9}}\n\n{{coord missing|Netherlands}}\n\n{{Netherlands topics}}\n\n[[Category:1795 disestablishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:County of Holland| ]]\n[[Category:Former polities in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Counties of the Holy Roman Empire|Holland]]\n[[Category:Seventeen Provinces|Holland]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1795]]\n", "text_old": "{{More footnotes|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox country\n|native_name            = {{native name|la|Comitatus Hollandiae}}<br/>{{native name|nl|Graafschap Holland}}\n|conventional_long_name = County of Holland\n|common_name            = Holland\n|status                 = Vassal\n|status_text            = [[Imperial State|State]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]<br/>part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] {{nowrap|<small>(1432\u20131482)</small>}}<br/>part of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] {{nowrap|<small>(1482\u20131581)</small>}}<br/>part of the [[Dutch Republic]] {{nowrap|<small>(1581\u20131795)</small>}}\n|era                    = [[Middle Ages]],  [[Renaissance]], [[Modern history|Modern]]\n|life_span              = 1091\u20131795\n|event_start            = Established\n|date_start             = \n|year_start             = 11th century\n|event1                 = [[Act of Abjuration]]\n|date_event1            = 26 July 1581\n|event_end              = [[Batavian Revolution]]\n|date_end               = 18 January\n|year_end               = 1795\n|p1                     = Lower Lorraine\n|flag_p1                = Lothringen-Nieder.PNG\n|border_p1              = no\n|s1                     = Batavian Republic\n|flag_s1                = Flag of the navy of the Batavian Republic.svg\n|national_motto         = {{native name|la|\"Vigilate Deo confidentes\"|nolink=yes|italics=off}}<br>{{small|\"Watch, trusting in God\"}}\n\n|government_type        = Feudal monarchy\n|title_leader           = [[Count of Holland|Count]]\n|leader1                = [[Gerolf of Holland|Gerolf]] <small>(first)</small>\n|year_leader1           = 880\u2013896\n|leader2                = [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]] <small>(last)</small>\n|year_leader2           = 1555\u20131581\n|title_deputy           = [[Stadtholder]]\n|deputy1                = [[Hugo van Lannoy|Hugo]] <small>(first)</small>\n|year_deputy1           = 1433\u20131440\n|deputy2                = [[William III of England|William III]] <small>(last)</small>\n|legislature            = [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States]]\n|year_deputy2           = 1672\u20131702\n\n|flag                   = <!--- Link target under flag image.

The territory of the County of Holland corresponds roughly with the current provinces of [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]] in the [[Netherlands]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe oldest sources refer to the not clearly defined county as ''[[Frisia]]'', west of the [[Vlie]] (also known as West-Frisia). Before 1101, sources talk about Frisian counts, but in this year [[Floris II, Count of Holland]] is mentioned as ''Florentius comes de Hollant'' (Floris, Count of Holland). Holland is probably [[Old Dutch]] for ''holt lant'', literally \"wood land,\" The counts of Holland generally kept to this single title until 1291, when [[Floris V, Count of Holland]] decided to call himself ''Count of Holland and Zeeland, lord of Friesland''. This title was also used after Holland was united with [[Hainaut (province)|Hainault]], [[Bavaria-Straubing]], and the [[Duchy of Burgundy]]. The titles eventually lost their importance, and the last count, [[Philip II of Spain]], only mentioned them halfway through his long list of titles.\n\n==History==\n\n===Francia and Lotharingia===\nAround 800, under [[Charlemagne]], the [[Frankish Empire]] covered much of Europe. In much of this empire, an important unit of regional administration (corresponding roughly to a [[shire]] or [[county]] in England) was the ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]]'' ([[Frankish language|Frankish]]) or ''[[pagus]]'' (Latin). A ''comes'' ([[count]]) ruled one or more ''gaue''. Because of the low volume of trade, the negative trade balance with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Muslim states and the disappearance of currency, the economy was more-or-less reduced to [[barter]]. The king's [[vassals]] could only be rewarded with land (''beneficium'' or, from the tenth century, ''feodum'') and [[usufruct]]. From this, [[feudalism]] developed. The vassals, who were generally appointed by the king, strove for a system of inheritance. This became more and more the rule, and in 877 it was legalised in the [[Capitulary of Quierzy]].\n\nUpon the death of a king, the Frankish kingdom was frequently divided among his heirs. This [[partible inheritance]] often caused internal strife, which made centralized government problematic. The [[Viking]] raids further undermined centralized government. At the end of the reign of Emperor [[Louis the Pious]], royal power had weakened because of the [[Floods in the Netherlands|flood of 838]] and infighting between the king's sons. After Louis died in 840 his son, Emperor [[Lothair I]] (king of [[Middle Francia]]), rewarded the Danish brothers [[Rorik of Dorestad|Rorik]] and Harald with [[Frisia]] \u2014 present-day [[Holland]] \u2014 in an attempt to resist Viking attacks.\n\nWhen Lothair died in 855, the northern part of Middle Francia was awarded to his second son [[Lothair II]] and was called [[Lotharingia]]. The 880 [[Treaty of Ribemont]] added the Kingdom of Lotharingia (which included the [[Low Countries]]) to [[East Francia]], which attempted to integrate it. However, there were no connections like those between the four German [[Stem duchy|stem duchies]] of east Francia: [[Duchy of Franconia|Franconia]], the [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], the [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]]. Lotharingia had considerable self-determination; this became clear when [[Louis the Child]], East Francia's last [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]], died in 911. Although the stem duchies flocked to Duke [[Conrad I of Germany|Conrad I of Franconia]], Lotharingia chose Carolingian king of [[West Francia]] [[Charles the Simple]].\n\n[[File:Rorik by H. W. Koekkoek.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bearded older man, dressed for battle|Rorik of Dorestad in a 1912 illustration by [[Hermanus Willem Koekkoek]]]]\nIn Frisia, the situation was complex. Power was in the hands of Rorik's successor, [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia|Godfrid]], who became embroiled in the politics of the Frankish empire and was allied with the children of Lothair II. Danish rule ended in 885 with the murder of Godfrid at [[Spijk, Rijnwaarden|Herispijk]], and all Danes east of the coastal areas of [[West Frisia]] were killed or driven out in must have been a complex, successful conspiracy led by [[Henry of Franconia]] in which a coalition of Babenberg Franks, Hamaland Saxons and Teisterbant Frisians (in cooperation with the bishop of Cologne and the emperor) outsmarted Godfrid and the Danes. The chief conspirator in the murder was [[Everard Saxo]], count of [[Hamaland]]. One of those who profited most from the power vacuum was the Frisian [[Gerolf of Holland|Gerolf]], ''comes Fresonum'' (count of Frisia), from [[Westergo]] in the present-day province of [[Friesland]]. Gerolf, Godfrid's former envoy to the emperor, demanded lands in the [[Moselle]] valley from the emperor to provoke a war. After the elimination of a large portion of the Danish population, Gerulf controlled a large Frisian part of the later county of Holland. This ''fait accompli'' was recognised when Gerolf was given lands [[allodial|in full ownership]] on 4 August 889 by the East Frankish king [[Arnulf of Carinthia]], who needed strong warlords in the delta region to keep the Danes and other Vikings out. The lands in question included an area outside Gerulf's county, in Teisterbant, which included [[Tiel]], [[Aalburg]] and [[Asch (Netherlands)|Asch]]. It also involved a forest and field between the mouth of the [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Old Rhine]] (and presumably [[Bennebroek]]), Suithardeshaga, the border between the former Frankish counties of Rijnland and Kennemerland.\n\nKing [[Charles the Simple]] gave the church in [[Egmond (municipality)|Egmond]] and its possessions to Count [[Dirk I, Count of Holland|Dirk I of Holland]] in 922 in gratitude for Dirk's support in the [[Battle of Soissons (923)|Battle of Soissons]] to suppress a rebellion of his West Frankish vassals. The West Frankish king was able to do this because the lands and churches he granted to Dirk were outside his jurisdiction; Egmond was just north of possessions which Dirk had received from Gerulf, and was a good match. He then founded [[Egmond Abbey]], Holland's oldest monastery. When Charles the Simple was deposed in 923, King [[Henry the Fowler]] of East Francia allied with Count [[Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine|Gilbert of Hainaut]] (son of Duke [[Reginar, Duke of Lorraine|Reginar of Lorraine]]) and re-conquered Lotharingia. By 925, the Lotharingian nobles accepted his rule and Lotharingia (with the Frisian lands) became a fifth German stem duchy. Henry's power was limited by his vassal, [[Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine|Gilbert]] (Duke of Lotharingia), whose power was limited to his own counties.\n\n===Imperial State===\n{{History Benelux states}}\nThe rising status of the [[Count of holland#House of Holland|House of Holland]] was shown when in 938 Count [[Dirk II, Count of Holland|Dirk II]], probably the grandson of Count Dirk I, married at the age of 8 with Hildegard of Flanders, daughter of Count [[Arnulf I, Count of Flanders|Arnulf I of Flanders]]. The count of Holland was in this period more of a military commander who had to resist Viking raids, and subject to the authority of the [[Bishopric of Utrecht]]. In 985, King [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]], at the request of his mother [[Theophanu]], granted the ownership (''proprium'') of a number of lands to count Dirk II. These lands had already been given in [[Fief|loan]] (''beneficium''). This was the area between the rivers ''Loira'' or [[De Lier|Lier]] and ''[[Hollandse IJssel|Hisla]]'' (a [[Gau (country subdivision)|gouw]] called [[Maasland|Masaland]]), ''[[Zonnemaire|villa Sunnimeri]]'' (on the Zeelandish island of Schouwen), the area between the rivers ''[[Medemblik|Medemelaka]]'' and ''Chinnelosara gemerchi'' ([[Kennemerland|Kinheim]]) and the gouw [[Texel|Texla]].\n\nIn 993, count [[Arnulf, Count of Holland|Arnulf of Gent]] was killed in a battle against Frisian land reclaimers who did not want to pay their due to the count. It's unknown where this battle took place but it was probably in the Rijnland or in the Maas estuary. Arnulf's son, count [[Dirk III, Count of Holland|Dirk III of Holland]] was too young to rule, so his mother [[Lutgardis of Luxemburg]] acted as regent. In 1005 Dirk was old enough to rule in his own name, but he still made thankful use of the good connections that his mother had made. According to Thietmar of Merseburg a reconciliation with the Frisians was arranged with help from his uncle in-law, king [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]], who travelled with an army and a fleet from [[Utrecht]] to the Maas-estuary (probably [[Vlaardingen]]) to force the inhabitants to recognize their count. This expedition appears to have been successful since after 1005 no revolts against the count in this southern part of the later county of Holland are known.\n\n[[File:Rochussen Egmond.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Dirk VI, Count of Holland]], 1114\u20131157, and his mother Petronella visiting the work on the [[Egmond Abbey]], Charles Rochussen, 1881.]]\n[[File:Caesar van Everdingen Count Willem II of Holland Granting Privileges.jpg|thumb|left|''Count Willem II of Holland Granting Privileges'' by [[Caesar van Everdingen]] and [[Pieter Post]], 1654.]]\nAs a result of a promise he had made during the Frisian rebellion, Dirk III went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. When he returned, the northern side of his county had become unsafe, so he travelled south and started granting rights to reclaim lands from nature around present day [[Vlaardingen]] in order to cultivate this lands. He also built a castle at ''Silva Meriwido'', the future Vlaardingen. From this castle he forced merchants that travelled per ship from [[Tiel]] to England to pay toll. The Bishop of Utrecht, [[Adalbold II of Utrecht|Adalbold]] and the merchants of Tiel complained against this piracy at the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag of Nijmegen]] in 1018, the merchants of Tiel effectively pointing out that the emperor was losing tax revenue when he allowed the Tiel merchants to being plundered by Dirk III. It was decided to act against Dirk III. An army led by [[Godfrey II, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Godfrey II]] Duke of [[Lower Lorraine]], consisting of a fleet with soldiers from the bishops of [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]], [[Archbishop of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai|Cambrai]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge]] was however surprisingly ambushed in a swamp and nearly annihilated by Dirk III Frisian subjects in what was called the [[Battle of Vlaardingen]], Dirk III himself playing a coordinating role, only to appear from his castle to officially take prisoner the duke of Lower Lorraine, when Godfrey was on the verge of being killed.\n\nSo as not to weaken the protection the county of Holland offered against the Viking raids, King Henry II decided to let the matter rest, though he did strengthen the position of the Bishop of Utrecht, the nominal feudal lord of the counts of Holland. Nonetheless Dirk managed to expand his territory to the east at the cost of the Bishopric of Utrecht. After the death of Henry II in 1024, Dirk III supported the candidature of [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] in an attempt to reconcile with the imperial authorities, so as to keep the lands he had acquired, or expand them even further.\n\nEmperor Conrad II died during a stay in Utrecht in 1039 during the rule of bishop [[Bernold]], after which his organs were interred in the [[St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht|Cathedral of Utrecht]]. His son and successor, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], granted numerous favors to the bishopric of Utrecht. In this way, the [[Overijssel#History|Oversticht]] was assigned to the bishopric in 1040. Though the count of Holland had been reconciled with the emperor, Henry III still decided to punish the count. In 1046 the emperor forced [[Dirk IV, Count of Holland|Dirk IV]] to relinquish the lands he had conquered. However, the emperor was not able to maintain himself in the area and was forced to retreat, after which Dirk IV started to raid and plunder the bishoprics of Utrecht and Li\u00e8ge. Moreover, Dirk signed treaties with [[Godfrey III, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Godfrey the Bearded]], duke of Lower Lorraine, as well as the counts of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]]. The Emperor responded with a second punitive expedition in which Vlaardingen and the castle at [[Rijnsburg]] were taken from Dirk IV. The castle was completely destroyed. However, the emperor suffered heavy losses during his retreat, upon which Dirk's allies openly revolted against the emperor. In 1049 Dirk IV was lured into a trap and killed by assassins hired by the bishops of [[Bishopric of Metz|Metz]], Li\u00e8ge and Utrecht. Dirk died young, unmarried and childless. He was succeeded by his brother [[Floris I, Count of Holland|Floris I]].\n\nFloris I managed to expand his territory with a small area within the Rijnland Gouw, an area called ''Holtland'' (\"Woodland\"), or ''Holland''. It is most likely that this name soon became synonymous with Floris' whole territory. In 1061 a war broke out, in which it is not clear whether it was against [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], Utrecht or Li\u00e8ge. During this war Floris was ambushed while relaxing to much and in too small a company when he was raiding in the former Teisterbant county, now Utrechtian territory. He was killed by either Utrechtian or Gueldrian troops. His son [[Dirk V, Count of Holland|Dirk V]] was still a minor, so his mother [[Gertrude of Saxony]] became regent. Gertrude remarried in 1063 with [[Robert I, Count of Flanders|Robert the Frisian]], a younger brother of the [[county of Flanders|count of Flanders]], [[Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders|Baldwin VI]] and a grandson of a former French king, [[Robert II of France|Robert II]], who also acted as regent for Dirk V.\n\nIn 1064, Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] donated lands belonging to the county of Holland, 'west of the [[Vlie]] and around the banks of the Rhine' (the gouw of Westflinge), to [[William I (Bishop of Utrecht)|William, Bishop of Utrecht]], on whose support the Emperor could count. Dirk V was only allowed to keep the gouw of Masaland. Through battles in 1071 and 1072, William of Utrecht, with support from the highly competent Duke [[Godfrey IV, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Godfrey IV]] of Lower Lorraine, managed to gain actual central control over nearly the entire later county of Holland for the first time. Robert the Frisian and Dirk V had to flee to [[Ghent]]. This could have been the end of the Gerulfingian dynasty. Robert the Frisian managed however against some odds to become count of Flanders in 1076 when in the [[Battle of Cassel (1071)|battle of Cassel]] he managed to beat a grand coalition of Hainaut, French and Normandian forces. Being now the count of Flanders he was able to assist his stepson to reclaim the county of Holland. The pair started by taking out their most dangerous adversary. Godfrey IV was killed at night while defecating. Shortly afterwards the formidable bishop William of Utrecht also died. After this Robert I and his stepson Dirk V besieged the new Utrecht/Lotharingian castle at a strategic place at the delta in [[IJsselmonde (Rotterdam)|IJsselmonde]], where the [[Hollandse IJssel]] (still existing) joined the Merwede (not existing any more in the form of 1000 years ago). In the [[battle of IJsselmonde]] they managed to capture the new bishop [[Conrad (Bishop of Utrecht)|Conrad of Swabia]], who was now forced to return the lands to Dirk V's control. In 1101, the name \"Holland\" first appears in a deed.\n\nHolland's influence continued to gradually grow over the next two centuries. The counts of Holland were able to conquer most of [[Zeeland]], to diminish the power of bishops of Utrecht and from the start of the 12th until the 13th century fight a 150 year long war against the inhabitants of the area living at the east side of North Holland, also confusingly known as \"West-Frisians\". It was not until 1289 that Count [[Floris V]] was able to bring this long war to an end and subjugate these West Frisians, this only after the [[St. Lucia's flood]] in 1287 had completely devastated nearly all the lands of the West-Frisians. After this the county was officially known until 1795 as the county of Holland and West Friesland.\n\n===Burgundians and Habsburgs===\n[[File:Holland_1500.PNG|thumb|The County of Holland in the 15th century]]\n[[File:1558 Hollandt v Deventer.jpg|thumb|A 1558 map of Holland.]]\nThe [[Hook and Cod Wars]] were a series of wars and battles in Holland between 1350 and 1490. Most of these wars were fought over the title of count, but some have argued that the underlying reason was because of the power struggle of the [[bourgeois]] in the cities against the ruling nobility. The Cod faction generally consisted of the more progressive cities of [[Holland]]. The Hook faction consisted for a large part of the conservative noblemen. Some of the main figures in this multi-generational conflict were [[William IV, Count of Holland|William IV]], [[Margaret II, Countess of Hainaut|Margaret]], [[William V, Count of Hainaut|William V]], [[William VI, Count of Holland|William VI, Count of Holland and Hainaut]], [[John, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing|John]] and Philip the Good. Perhaps the most well known, however, is [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]]. By the end of the Hook and Cod Wars, [[Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], had taken control of Holland. Leading noblemen in Holland had invited the duke to conquer Holland, even though he had no historical claim to it. Some historians say that the ruling class in Holland wanted Holland to integrate with the [[Flanders|Flemish]] economic system and adopt Flemish legal institutions.\n\nUnder the Burgundians, Holland's trade developed rapidly, especially in the areas of shipping and transport. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests. The fleets of Holland defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. Amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the Baltic region. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital to the people of Holland, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the peat of the former wetlands to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\n[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] (1500\u201358) became the owner in 1506, but in 1515 he left to become king of Spain and later became the Holy Roman Emperor. Charles turned over control to regents (his close relatives), and in practice rule was exercised by mostly French speaking Burgundians he controlled. Holland retained its own governments and court, controlled by the local nobility, and its own traditions and rights (\"liberties\") dating back centuries. Likewise the numerous cities had their own legal rights and local governments, usually controlled by the merchants, On top of this, however, the Burgundians had imposed an overall government, the Estates General of the Netherlands, with its own officials and courts.<ref>H.G. Koenigsberger, \"The Beginnings of the States General of the Netherlands,\" ''Parliaments, Estates and Representation'' (1988) 8#2 pp 101-114.</ref>\n\n===Revolt and the Dutch Republic===\n[[File:Veen01.jpg|thumb|left|The Relief of Leiden by the ''[[Geuzen]]'' in 1574, by [[Otto van Veen]].]]\nDuring the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation]] rapidly gained ground in northern Europe, especially in its Lutheran and Calvinist forms.<ref>R. Po-chia Hsia, ed. ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2006)  pp 118-34</ref> Protestants in Holland, after initial repression, were tolerated by local authorities. By the 1560s, the Protestant community had become a significant influence in the county, although it clearly formed a minority then.<ref>Jonathan I. Israel, ''The Dutch Republic Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (1995) p. 104</ref> In a society dependent on trade, freedom and tolerance were considered essential. Nevertheless, the Catholic rulers Charles V and his successor [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] felt it was their duty to defeat Protestantism, which was considered a heresy by the Catholic Church and a threat to the stability of the whole hierarchical political system.<ref>Hsia, ed. ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2006)  pp 3-36</ref> The Catholic Spanish responded with harsh persecution and introduced the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. Calvinists rebelled. First there was the [[Beeldenstorm|iconoclasm]] in 1566, which was the systematic destruction of statues of saints and other Catholic devotional depictions in churches. After 1566 [[William the Silent]], more or less by accident became the leader of a revolt that by severe mismanagement by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his governor the [[Duke of Alva]] turned in the [[Eighty Years' War]]. As a consequence Holland and the other six allied provinces became an independent nation called the [[Dutch republic|Republic of the Seven United Provinces]]. Over William of Orange Blum says, \"His patience, tolerance, determination, concern for his people, and belief in government by consent held the Dutch together and kept alive their spirit of revolt.\"<ref>Jerome  Blum et al, ''The European World: A History'' (1970) pp 160-61</ref> The main breakthrough came when Holland, along with Zeeland, were conquered in 1572 and following years by the [[Watergeuzen]], a somehow effective maritime force of mainly Calvinists who turned pirate and pirates who turned Calvinist.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477-1806'' (1995) pp 361-95</ref><ref>Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''The Reformation'' (2005) pp 367-72</ref>\n\n[[File:Johannes Lingelbach 001.jpg|thumb|''Dam Square with the New Town Hall under Construction'', by [[Johannes Lingelbach]], 1656.]]\nThe States General of the Netherlands signed the [[Act of Abjuration]], deposing Philip as Count of Holland and forming a confederation between the seven liberated provinces. From then on, the executive and legislative power would again rest with the [[States of Holland and West Friesland]], which were led by a political figure who held the office of [[Grand Pensionary]]. The county, now a sovereign state within this larger confederation, became the cultural, political and economic centre of the [[Dutch Republic]], in the 17th century, the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the wealthiest nation in the world. The largest cities in the republic were situated in the province of Holland, such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Leiden]], [[Alkmaar]], [[Delft]], [[Dordrecht]], [[Haarlem]], and the nation's capital, [[The Hague]]. From the great ports of Holland, Hollandic merchants sailed to and from destinations all over [[Europe]], and merchants from all over Europe gathered to trade in the warehouses of Amsterdam and other trading cities of Holland. Many Europeans thought of the United Provinces first as \"Holland\" rather than as the \"Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands\". A strong impression of \"Holland\" was planted in the minds of other Europeans, which then was projected back onto the Republic as a whole. Within the provinces themselves, a gradual slow process of cultural expansion took place, leading to a \"Hollandification\" of the other provinces and a more uniform culture for the whole of the Republic. In the early decades of the uprising a great number of refugees from Flanders and Brabant settled in the big cities of Holland. They had a [[Francia|Frankish]] influence on the new dialect of urban Holland (that earlier had more Frisian influences) that in later centuries became the [[standard language]] of the Netherlands and Dutch-speaking Belgium.\n\nNominally, the County of Holland formally came to an end in 1795, when the [[Batavian Revolution]] ended the republic and reformed it as the [[Batavian Republic]]. The territory of the former county was divided between the departments of the ''Amstel'', ''Delf'', ''Texel'', and ''Schelde en Maas''. After 1813, Holland was restored as a province of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Holland was divided into the present provinces [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]] in 1840.\n\n==Geography==\nThe county covered an area roughly corresponding to the current Dutch provinces of [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]], as well as the northwestern part of the current province of [[North Brabant]] (roughly between the towns of [[Willemstad, North Brabant|Willemstad]], [[Geertruidenberg]] and [[Werkendam]]), and the islands of [[Terschelling]], [[Vlieland]], [[Urk]] and [[Schokland]], though it did not include the island of [[Goeree-Overflakkee]].\n\nIn the early Middle Ages, large parts of the area covered by the present day Netherlands were covered by [[Bog|peat bogs]]. These bogs limited the size of [[arable land]] in the Netherlands, but also proved to be a good source of fuel. Around 950, small scale reclamation was started on the enormous bogs in Holland and Utrecht, probably set in motion by the minor nobility. In the 11th century the 'Great Reclamation' started, under the control of the counts of Holland and the bishops of Utrecht. Until the 13th century, large amounts of land was reclaimed between the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ bay]] in the north, the dunes in the west, the [[Lek (river)|Lek]] and [[Waal (river)|Waal]] rivers in the south and the [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Old Rhine]] in the east.\n\nBefore the Great Reclamation, the borders between the county of Holland and the bishopric of Utrecht were unclear, and there existed a literal [[no-man's land]]. However, during the reclamation the counts of Holland managed to expand their influence at the cost of Utrecht.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Count of Holland]]\n* [[Counties of the Holy Roman Empire]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |title=Algemene Geschiedenis der Nederlanden |last=Block |first=Dick |year=1977\u20131983 |publisher=Fibula-Van Dishoeck |location=Haarlem |isbn=90-228-3800-5 }}\n*{{cite book |title=Geschiedenis van de Nederlanden |last=Lamberts |first=J.C.H. |year=2006 |publisher=HBuitgevers |location=Baarn |isbn=90-5574-474-3}}\n*{{cite book |title=Oorlog om Holland 1000-1375 |last=Graaf |first=A.C.F. |year=1970 |location=Hilversum |isbn=90-6550-807-4}}\n*{{cite book |title=Oorkondenboek van Holland en Zeeland tot 1299, Deel I - einde 7e eeuw tot 1222 |last=Koch |first=A.C.F. |year=1970 |publisher= Nijhoff |location=Den Haag |isbn=90-247-0403-0}}\n*{{cite book |title=Geschiedenis van Holland tot 1572 |last=Beukers |first=T. de |year=2002 |location=Hilversum |isbn=90-6550-682-9}}\n\n{{coord missing|Netherlands}}\n\n{{Netherlands topics}}\n\n[[Category:1795 disestablishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:County of Holland| ]]\n[[Category:Former polities in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Counties of the Holy Roman Empire|Holland]]\n[[Category:Seventeen Provinces|Holland]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1795]]\n", "name_user": "Alphathon", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEtymology", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Holland"}
