It is situated in the most fertile part of all the Hejazi territory, the streams of the vicinity tending to converge in this locality. An immense [[plain]] extends to the south; in every direction the view is bounded by hills and mountains.\n\nThe historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, {{convert|30|to|40|ft|abbr=out}} high, dating from the 12th century CE, and was flanked with towers, while on a rock, stood a castle. Of its four gates, the ''Bab-al-Salam'', or [[Egypt]]ian gate, was remarkable for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations. These suburbs also had walls and gates. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centred on the vastly expanded ''al-Masjid an-Nabawi''.\n\nThe graves of [[Fatimah]] ([[Genealogy of Khadijah's daughters|Muhammad's daughter]]) and [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] ([[Ahl al-Bayt|Muhammad's grandson]]), across from the mosque at ''Jannat [[al-Baqi']]'', and Abu Bakr (first caliph and the father of [[Muhammad's wives|Muhammad's wife]], [[Aisha]]), and of Umar ibn Al-Khattab), the second caliph, are also here. The mosque dates back to the time of Muhammad, but has been twice reconstructed.<ref name=\"EA\">1954 [[Encyclopedia Americana]], vol. 18, pp.587, 588</ref>\n\nBecause of the Saudi government's religious policy and concern that historic sites could become the focus for [[idolatry in Islam|idolatry]], much of Medina's Islamic physical heritage has been [[Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia|altered]].\n\n==Religious significance in Islam==\n{{Main|Muhammad in Medina}}\n[[File:The Green Dome, Masjid Nabawi, Madina.jpg|thumb|The Green Dome of the Prophet's Mosque]]\n\nMedina's importance as a religious site derives from the presence of ''al-Masjid an-Nabawi''. The mosque was expanded by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] Caliph [[Al-Walid I]]. [[Mount Uhud]] is a mountain north of Medina which was the site of the second battle between [[Muslim]] and Meccan forces.\n\nAfter Muhammad migrated to Madinah, he built Quba' Mosque and offered prayers in it.

It was restored by [[Qaitbay]], the [[List of rulers of Egypt|Egyptian ruler]], in 1487.<ref name=\"EA\"/> \n\nMuslims are encouraged to perform 2 rakaat of Sunnah prayer at this Quba' Mosque. According to a hadith from Sunan Ibn Majah, Sahl ibn Hunayf reported that Muhammad  said, ''\u201cWhoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the mosque of Quba' and prays in it, he will have a reward like the Umrah pilgrimage.\u201d'' (Hadith by Imam Ibn Majah)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://muslim.sg/articles/11-places-to-visit-in-madinah?type=articles|title=10 Places To Visit In Madinah|website=muslim.sg|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n''Masjid al-Qiblatain'' is another mosque also historically important to Muslims.

Both cities' numerous mosques are the destination for large numbers of Muslims on their '[[Umrah]] (second pilgrimage after Hajj). Hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to Medina annually while performing pilgrimage [[Hajj]]. [[Al-Baqi']] is a significant cemetery in Medina where several [[Banu Hashim|family members of Muhammad]], caliphs and scholars are buried.\n\nIslamic scriptures emphasise the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times as being sacred in the Quran, for example [[ayah]]; 9:101, 9:129, 59:9, and ayah 63:7. [[Medinan sura]]s are typically longer than their Meccan counterparts. There is also a book within the [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] titled 'Virtues of Medina'.<ref>[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=30&translator=1 hadith found in 'Virtues of Madinah' of Sahih Bukhari] searchtruth.com</ref>\n\n[[Sahih Bukhari]] says:\n{{quote|Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, \"Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that.

At first, these tribes were allied with Jewish rulers, but later they revolted and became  independent.<ref name=\"Medina\">\"Al-Medina.\" ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''</ref> Toward the end of the 5th century,<ref>for date see \"J. Q. R.\" vii. 175, note</ref> the Jewish rulers lost control of the city to Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj. The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] states that \"by calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet the principal Jews\", Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj finally gained the upper hand at Medina.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia 1\"/>\n\nMost modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the Aus and the Khazraj.<ref>See e.g., Peters 193; \"Qurayza\", ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''</ref> However, according to scholar of Islam [[William Montgomery Watt]], the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and he maintained that the Jewish populace retained a measure of political independence.<ref name=\"Medina\"/>\n\nEarly Muslim chronicler [[Ibn Ishaq]] tells of an ancient conflict between the last [[Yemen]]ite king of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]]<ref>Muslim sources usually referred to Himyar kings by the dynastic title of \"[[Tubba']]\".</ref> and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. According to [[Ibn Ishaq]], he was stopped from doing so by two [[rabbi]]s from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the [[Quraysh]] would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.\" The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to [[Judaism]]. He took the [[rabbi]]s with him, and in [[Mecca]], they reportedly recognised the [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] as a temple built by [[Abraham]] and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.<ref>Guillaume 7\u20139, Peters 49\u201350</ref>\n\nEventually the Banu Aus and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE/1 AH, they had been fighting for 120 years and were the sworn enemies of each other.<ref name=\"balagh.net\">Subhani, ''The Message'': [http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm The Events of the First Year of Migration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524053521/http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm |date=24 May 2012 }}</ref> The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the Aus, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj.<ref>For alliances, see Guillaume 253</ref> They fought a total of four wars.<ref name=\"Medina\"/>\n\nTheir last and bloodiest battle was the [[Battle of Bu'ath]]<ref name=\"Medina\"/> that was fought a few years before the arrival of Muhammad.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia 1\"/> The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]], one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. Until the arrival of Muhammad, he was the most respected inhabitant of Yathrib. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of the city met secretly with [[Muhammad]] in Al-Aqaba, a place between Makkah and Mina, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to Yathrib, where Muhammad could serve as disinterested mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.\n\n===Muhammad's arrival===\n{{Main|Hijra (Islam)|Constitution of Medina}}\nIn 622 CE/1 AH, Muhammad and around 70 Meccan [[Muhajirun]] believers left Mecca for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as civic leader. The Muslim converts native to Yathrib of whatever background\u2014pagan Arab or Jewish\u2014were called ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'' (\"the Patrons\" or \"the Helpers\"), while the Muslims would pay the [[Zakat]] tax.\n\nAccording to [[Ibn Ishaq]], the local pagan Arab tribes, the Muslim ''[[Muhajirun]]'' from Mecca, the local Muslims (''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]''), and the Jewish population of the area signed an agreement, the [[Constitution of Medina]], which committed all parties to mutual co-operation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by [[Ibn Hisham]] is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement\u2014whether a single document originally or several\u2014is possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess.<ref>Firestone 118. For opinions disputing the early date of the Constitution of Medina, see e.g., Peters 116; \"Muhammad\", \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\"; \"Kurayza, Banu\", \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\".</ref> In Yemenite Jewish sources, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as ''kit\u0101b \u1e0fimmat al-nabi'', written in the 17th year of the [[Hijri year|Hijra]] (638 CE), and which gave express liberty unto Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks, but were required to pay the [[jizya]] (poll-tax) annually for their protection by their patrons.<ref>Shelomo Dov Goitein, ''The Yemenites \u2013 History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life'' (Selected Studies), editor: Menahem Ben-Sasson, Jerusalem 1983, pp. 288\u2013299. {{ISBN|965-235-011-7}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Badr====\n{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}\n{{Main|Battle of Badr}}\n[[File:Battle of Badr.png|thumb|Battle positions at Badr]]\nThe Battle of Badr was a key battle in the early days of Islam and a turning point in Muhammad's struggle with his opponents among the Quraysh in Mecca. In the spring of 624, Muhammad received word from his intelligence sources that a trade caravan, commanded by [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]], Chieftain of the Meccan Quraysh, and guarded by thirty to forty men, was travelling from [[Syria (region)|Syria]] back to Mecca. Muhammad gathered an army of 313 men, the largest army the Muslims had put in the field yet. However, many early Muslim sources, including the Quran, indicate that no serious fighting was expected,<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 5, Book 59, Number 287] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821035058/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 |date=21 August 2011 }}</ref> and the future Caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan]] stayed behind to care for his sick wife.\n\nAs the caravan approached Medina, Abu Sufyan began hearing from travellers and riders about Muhammad's planned ambush. He sent a messenger named Damdam to Mecca to warn the Quraysh and get reinforcements. Alarmed, the Quraysh assembled an army of 900\u20131,000 men to rescue the caravan. Many of the Qurayshi nobles, including [[Amr ibn Hish\u0101m]], [[Walid ibn Utba]], Shaiba, and [[Umayyah ibn Khalaf]], joined the army. However, some of the army was to later return to Mecca before the battle.\n\nThe battle started with champions from both armies emerging to engage in combat. The Muslims sent out [[Ali]], [[Ubaydah ibn al-Harith]] (Obeida), and [[Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib]]. The Muslims dispatched the Meccan champions in a three-on-three m\u00eal\u00e9e, Hamzah killed his opponent with the very first strike, although Ubaydah was mortally wounded.<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 Sunan Abu Dawud: Book 14, Number 2659] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820142432/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 |date=20 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nNow both armies began firing arrows at each other.

Muhammad marched out to meet the force but before reaching the battle, about one third of the troops under Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew. With a smaller force, the Muslim army had to find a strategy to gain the upper hand. A group of archers were ordered to stay on a hill to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry forces and to provide protection at the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to somewhat retreat. The battle front was pushed further and further away from the archers, whom, from the start of the battle, had really nothing to do but watch. In their growing impatience to be part of the battle, and seeing that they were somewhat gaining advantage over the [[Kafir]]un ([[Infidel]]s) these archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading all along to the rest to not disobey their commanders' orders. But their words were lost among the enthusiastic yodels of their comrades.\n\nHowever, the Meccans' retreat was actually a manufactured manoeuvre that paid off. The hillside position had been a great advantage to the Muslim forces, and they had to be lured off their posts for the Meccans to turn the table over. Seeing that their strategy had actually worked, the Meccans cavalry forces went around the hill and re-appeared behind the pursuing archers. Thus, ambushed in the plain between the hill and the front line, the archers were systematically slaughtered, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill, shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but to little effect.\n\nHowever, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Medinans suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.{{cn|date=February 2019}}<ref>Esposito, John L. \"Islam.\" Worldmark Encyclopedia of Religious Practices, edited by Thomas Riggs, vol. 1: Religions and Denominations, Gale, 2006, pp. 349-379.</ref>\n\n====Battle of the Trench====\n{{Main|Battle of the Trench}}\n\nIn 627, Abu Sufyan once more led Meccan forces against Medina. Because the people of Medina had dug a trench to further protect the city, this event became known as the Battle of the Trench. After a protracted siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again. During the siege, Abu Sufyan had contacted the remaining Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the defenders from behind the lines. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Banu Aus now interceded on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to the appointment of one of their chiefs, [[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]], as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish Law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason (Deutoronomy).<ref name=\"mantran\">Robert Mantran, ''L'expansion musulmane'' Presses Universitaires de France 1995, p. 86.</ref> This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The historian Robert Mantran argues that from this point of view it was successful&nbsp;\u2014 from this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.<ref name=\"mantran\"/>\n\n===Capital city of Muhammad and the Rashidun Caliphate===\n[[File:Madina Munavara.JPG|thumb|250px|Old depiction of Medina during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times]]\n\nIn the ten years following the [[hijra (Islam)|hijra]], Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he [[Conquest of Mecca|marched on Mecca]], entering it without battle in 629 CE/8 AH, all parties acquiescing to his leadership. Afterwards, however, despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca and the ongoing importance of the Meccan [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] for Islamic pilgrimage ([[Hajj]]), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the capital of the early [[caliphate]].\n\n''Yathrib'' was renamed Medina from ''Madinat al-Nabi'' (\"city of the Prophet\" in [[Arabic]]) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and death there. (Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''Medinta'', which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dangoor.com/71page33.html|title=The Jews of Arabia|author=|date=|work=dangoor.com}}</ref>)\n\nUnder the first three caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Uthman]], Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the period of Uthman, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 CE/35 AH and murdered him in his own home. [[Ali]], the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to [[Kufa]] in [[Iraq]]. After that, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power.\n\nIn 1256 CE Medina was threatened by a lava flow from the [[Harrat Rahat]] volcanic area.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum=0301-07=|title=Harrat Rahat}}</ref><ref>Bosworth,C.

Medina was a city of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]]. Local rule was in the hands of the [[Hashemite]] clan as [[Sharif]]s or [[Emir]]s of Mecca. [[Fakhri Pasha]] was the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] governor of Medina. [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali bin Hussein]], the [[Sharif of Mecca]] and leader of the Hashemite clan, revolted against the [[Caliph]] in [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and sided with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. The city of Medina was besieged by the Sharif's forces, and Fakhri Pasha tenaciously held on during the [[Siege of Medina]] from 1916 till 10 January 1919. He refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the [[Armistice of Moudros]], until he was arrested by his own men.<ref>Peters, Francis (1994).

Though the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, Medina is inhabited by an increasing number of Muslim and non-Muslim expatriate workers of other Arab nationalities (Egyptians, Jordanians, Lebanese, etc.), South Asians (Bangladeshis, Indians, Pakistanis, etc.) and Filipinos.\n\n==Geography==\nMedina is located in the [[Hejaz|Hijaz Region]] north-western of the country, {{convert|250|km|abbr=off}} east to the [[Red Sea]] , and {{convert|620|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]. It lies at the meeting-point of longitude 39\u00ba36' east and latitude 24\u00ba28' north. It covers an area of about {{convert|50|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}.\n\n===Topography===\nMedina is a desert oasis surrounded by mountains and volcanic hills, as mentioned in several references and sources. It was known as Yathrib in Writings of ancient Maeniand, this is obvious evidence that the population structure of this desert oasis is a combination of north Arabs and South Arabs, who settled there and built their civilization during the thousand years before Christ.\n\nThe soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly [[basalt]], while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first [[geological period]] of the [[Paleozoic]] Era.  It is surrounded by a number of mountains: Al-Hujaj, or Pilgrims' Mountain to the west, Salaa to the north-west, Al-E'er or Caravan Mountain to the south and Uhad to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the junction of the three valleys of Al-Aql, Al-Aqiq, and Al-Himdh, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry mountainous region. Its western and southwestern parts have many volcanic rocks. \n\n===Climate===\nMedina has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). Summers are extremely hot with daytime temperatures averaging about {{convert|43|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} with nights about {{convert|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}. Temperatures above {{convert|45|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} are not unusual between June and September. Winters are milder, with temperatures from {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} at night to {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} in the day.

It is situated in the most fertile part of all the Hejazi territory, the streams of the vicinity tending to converge in this locality. An immense [[plain]] extends to the south; in every direction the view is bounded by hills and mountains.\n\nThe historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, {{convert|30|to|40|ft|abbr=out}} high, dating from the 12th century CE, and was flanked with towers, while on a rock, stood a castle. Of its four gates, the ''Bab-al-Salam'', or [[Egypt]]ian gate, was remarkable for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations. These suburbs also had walls and gates. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centred on the vastly expanded ''al-Masjid an-Nabawi''.\n\nThe graves of [[Fatimah]] ([[Genealogy of Khadijah's daughters|Muhammad's daughter]]) and [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] ([[Ahl al-Bayt|Muhammad's grandson]]), across from the mosque at ''Jannat [[al-Baqi']]'', and Abu Bakr (first caliph and the father of [[Muhammad's wives|Muhammad's wife]], [[Aisha]]), and of Umar ibn Al-Khattab), the second caliph, are also here.

[[Mount Uhud]] is a mountain north of Medina which was the site of the second battle between [[Muslim]] and Meccan forces.\n\nAfter Muhammad migrated to Madinah, he built Quba' Mosque and offered prayers in it.

Both cities' numerous mosques are the destination for large numbers of Muslims on their '[[Umrah]] (second pilgrimage after Hajj). Hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to Medina annually while performing pilgrimage [[Hajj]]. [[Al-Baqi']] is a significant cemetery in Medina where several [[Banu Hashim|family members of Muhammad]], caliphs and scholars are buried.\n\nIslamic scriptures emphasise the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times as being sacred in the Quran, for example [[ayah]]; 9:101, 9:129, 59:9, and ayah 63:7. [[Medinan sura]]s are typically longer than their Meccan counterparts. There is also a book within the [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] titled 'Virtues of Medina'.<ref>[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=30&translator=1 hadith found in 'Virtues of Madinah' of Sahih Bukhari] searchtruth.com</ref>\n\n[[Sahih Bukhari]] says:\n{{quote|Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, \"Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that.

At first, these tribes were allied with Jewish rulers, but later they revolted and became  independent.<ref name=\"Medina\">\"Al-Medina.\" ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''</ref> Toward the end of the 5th century,<ref>for date see \"J.

The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] states that \"by calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet the principal Jews\", Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj finally gained the upper hand at Medina.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia 1\"/>\n\nMost modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the Aus and the Khazraj.<ref>See e.g., Peters 193; \"Qurayza\", ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]''</ref> However, according to scholar of Islam [[William Montgomery Watt]], the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and he maintained that the Jewish populace retained a measure of political independence.<ref name=\"Medina\"/>\n\nEarly Muslim chronicler [[Ibn Ishaq]] tells of an ancient conflict between the last [[Yemen]]ite king of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]]<ref>Muslim sources usually referred to Himyar kings by the dynastic title of \"[[Tubba']]\".</ref> and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. According to [[Ibn Ishaq]], he was stopped from doing so by two [[rabbi]]s from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the [[Quraysh]] would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.\" The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to [[Judaism]]. He took the [[rabbi]]s with him, and in [[Mecca]], they reportedly recognised the [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] as a temple built by [[Abraham]] and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.<ref>Guillaume 7\u20139, Peters 49\u201350</ref>\n\nEventually the Banu Aus and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE/1 AH, they had been fighting for 120 years and were the sworn enemies of each other.<ref name=\"balagh.net\">Subhani, ''The Message'': [http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm The Events of the First Year of Migration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524053521/http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm |date=24 May 2012 }}</ref> The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the Aus, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj.<ref>For alliances, see Guillaume 253</ref> They fought a total of four wars.<ref name=\"Medina\"/>\n\nTheir last and bloodiest battle was the [[Battle of Bu'ath]]<ref name=\"Medina\"/> that was fought a few years before the arrival of Muhammad.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia 1\"/> The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]], one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. Until the arrival of Muhammad, he was the most respected inhabitant of Yathrib. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of the city met secretly with [[Muhammad]] in Al-Aqaba, a place between Makkah and Mina, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to Yathrib, where Muhammad could serve as disinterested mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.\n\n===Muhammad's arrival===\n{{Main|Hijra (Islam)|Constitution of Medina}}\nIn 622 CE/1 AH, Muhammad and around 70 Meccan [[Muhajirun]] believers left Mecca for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as civic leader. The Muslim converts native to Yathrib of whatever background\u2014pagan Arab or Jewish\u2014were called ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'' (\"the Patrons\" or \"the Helpers\"), while the Muslims would pay the [[Zakat]] tax.\n\nAccording to [[Ibn Ishaq]], the local pagan Arab tribes, the Muslim ''[[Muhajirun]]'' from Mecca, the local Muslims (''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]''), and the Jewish population of the area signed an agreement, the [[Constitution of Medina]], which committed all parties to mutual co-operation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by [[Ibn Hisham]] is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement\u2014whether a single document originally or several\u2014is possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess.<ref>Firestone 118. For opinions disputing the early date of the Constitution of Medina, see e.g., Peters 116; \"Muhammad\", \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\"; \"Kurayza, Banu\", \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\".</ref> In Yemenite Jewish sources, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as ''kit\u0101b \u1e0fimmat al-nabi'', written in the 17th year of the [[Hijri year|Hijra]] (638 CE), and which gave express liberty unto Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks, but were required to pay the [[jizya]] (poll-tax) annually for their protection by their patrons.<ref>Shelomo Dov Goitein, ''The Yemenites \u2013 History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life'' (Selected Studies), editor: Menahem Ben-Sasson, Jerusalem 1983, pp. 288\u2013299. {{ISBN|965-235-011-7}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Badr====\n{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}\n{{Main|Battle of Badr}}\n[[File:Battle of Badr.png|thumb|Battle positions at Badr]]\nThe Battle of Badr was a key battle in the early days of Islam and a turning point in Muhammad's struggle with his opponents among the Quraysh in Mecca. In the spring of 624, Muhammad received word from his intelligence sources that a trade caravan, commanded by [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]], Chieftain of the Meccan Quraysh, and guarded by thirty to forty men, was travelling from [[Syria (region)|Syria]] back to Mecca. Muhammad gathered an army of 313 men, the largest army the Muslims had put in the field yet. However, many early Muslim sources, including the Quran, indicate that no serious fighting was expected,<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 5, Book 59, Number 287] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821035058/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 |date=21 August 2011 }}</ref> and the future Caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan]] stayed behind to care for his sick wife.\n\nAs the caravan approached Medina, Abu Sufyan began hearing from travellers and riders about Muhammad's planned ambush. He sent a messenger named Damdam to Mecca to warn the Quraysh and get reinforcements. Alarmed, the Quraysh assembled an army of 900\u20131,000 men to rescue the caravan. Many of the Qurayshi nobles, including [[Amr ibn Hish\u0101m]], [[Walid ibn Utba]], Shaiba, and [[Umayyah ibn Khalaf]], joined the army. However, some of the army was to later return to Mecca before the battle.\n\nThe battle started with champions from both armies emerging to engage in combat. The Muslims sent out [[Ali]], [[Ubaydah ibn al-Harith]] (Obeida), and [[Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib]].

Muhammad marched out to meet the force but before reaching the battle, about one third of the troops under Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew. With a smaller force, the Muslim army had to find a strategy to gain the upper hand. A group of archers were ordered to stay on a hill to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry forces and to provide protection at the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to somewhat retreat. The battle front was pushed further and further away from the archers, whom, from the start of the battle, had really nothing to do but watch. In their growing impatience to be part of the battle, and seeing that they were somewhat gaining advantage over the [[Kafir]]un ([[Infidel]]s) these archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading all along to the rest to not disobey their commanders' orders. But their words were lost among the enthusiastic yodels of their comrades.\n\nHowever, the Meccans' retreat was actually a manufactured manoeuvre that paid off. The hillside position had been a great advantage to the Muslim forces, and they had to be lured off their posts for the Meccans to turn the table over. Seeing that their strategy had actually worked, the Meccans cavalry forces went around the hill and re-appeared behind the pursuing archers. Thus, ambushed in the plain between the hill and the front line, the archers were systematically slaughtered, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill, shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but to little effect.\n\nHowever, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Medinans suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\n====Battle of the Trench====\n{{Main|Battle of the Trench}}\n\nIn 627, Abu Sufyan once more led Meccan forces against Medina. Because the people of Medina had dug a trench to further protect the city, this event became known as the Battle of the Trench. After a protracted siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again. During the siege, Abu Sufyan had contacted the remaining Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the defenders from behind the lines. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Banu Aus now interceded on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to the appointment of one of their chiefs, [[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]], as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish Law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason (Deutoronomy).<ref name=\"mantran\">Robert Mantran, ''L'expansion musulmane'' Presses Universitaires de France 1995, p. 86.</ref> This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The historian Robert Mantran argues that from this point of view it was successful&nbsp;\u2014 from this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.<ref name=\"mantran\"/>\n\n===Capital city of Muhammad and the Rashidun Caliphate===\n[[File:Madina Munavara.JPG|thumb|250px|Old depiction of Medina during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times]]\n\nIn the ten years following the [[hijra (Islam)|hijra]], Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he [[Conquest of Mecca|marched on Mecca]], entering it without battle in 629 CE/8 AH, all parties acquiescing to his leadership. Afterwards, however, despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca and the ongoing importance of the Meccan [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] for Islamic pilgrimage ([[Hajj]]), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the capital of the early [[caliphate]].\n\n''Yathrib'' was renamed Medina from ''Madinat al-Nabi'' (\"city of the Prophet\" in [[Arabic]]) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and death there. (Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''Medinta'', which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dangoor.com/71page33.html|title=The Jews of Arabia|author=|date=|work=dangoor.com}}</ref>)\n\nUnder the first three caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Uthman]], Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the period of Uthman, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 CE/35 AH and murdered him in his own home. [[Ali]], the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to [[Kufa]] in [[Iraq]]. After that, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power.\n\nIn 1256 CE Medina was threatened by a lava flow from the [[Harrat Rahat]] volcanic area.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum=0301-07=|title=Harrat Rahat}}</ref><ref>Bosworth,C.

Medina was a city of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]]. Local rule was in the hands of the [[Hashemite]] clan as [[Sharif]]s or [[Emir]]s of Mecca. [[Fakhri Pasha]] was the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] governor of Medina. [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali bin Hussein]], the [[Sharif of Mecca]] and leader of the Hashemite clan, revolted against the [[Caliph]] in [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and sided with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. The city of Medina was besieged by the Sharif's forces, and Fakhri Pasha tenaciously held on during the [[Siege of Medina]] from 1916 till 10 January 1919. He refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the [[Armistice of Moudros]], until he was arrested by his own men.<ref>Peters, Francis (1994).

Soon after, in 1924, he was defeated by [[Ibn Saud]], who integrated Medina and the whole of the [[Hejaz]] into the modern kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\n===Modern Medina===\n[[File:Modern Medina.JPG|thumb|right|Modern city of Medina]]\n\nToday, Medina (\"Madinah\" officially), in addition to being the second most important Islamic [[hajj|pilgrimage]] destination after [[Mecca]], is an important regional capital of the western Saudi Arabian province of Al Madinah. Though the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, Medina is inhabited by an increasing number of Muslim and non-Muslim expatriate workers of other Arab nationalities (Egyptians, Jordanians, Lebanese, etc.), South Asians (Bangladeshis, Indians, Pakistanis, etc.) and Filipinos.\n\n==Geography==\nMedina is located in the [[Hejaz|Hijaz Region]] north-western of the country, {{convert|250|km|abbr=off}} east to the [[Red Sea]] , and {{convert|620|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]. It lies at the meeting-point of longitude 39\u00ba36' east and latitude 24\u00ba28' north. It covers an area of about {{convert|50|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}.\n\n===Topography===\nMedina is a desert oasis surrounded by mountains and volcanic hills, as mentioned in several references and sources. It was known as Yathrib in Writings of ancient Maeniand, this is obvious evidence that the population structure of this desert oasis is a combination of north Arabs and South Arabs, who settled there and built their civilization during the thousand years before Christ.\n\nThe soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly [[basalt]], while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first [[geological period]] of the [[Paleozoic]] Era.  It is surrounded by a number of mountains: Al-Hujaj, or Pilgrims' Mountain to the west, Salaa to the north-west, Al-E'er or Caravan Mountain to the south and Uhad to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the junction of the three valleys of Al-Aql, Al-Aqiq, and Al-Himdh, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry mountainous region. Its western and southwestern parts have many volcanic rocks. \n\n===Climate===\nMedina has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). Summers are extremely hot with daytime temperatures averaging about {{convert|43|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} with nights about {{convert|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}. Temperatures above {{convert|45|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} are not unusual between June and September. Winters are milder, with temperatures from {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} at night to {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} in the day.

{"title_page": "Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church", "text_new": "{{short description|Highest Orthodox authority in the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria}}\n{{Copts}}\nThe '''[[Holy Synod]] of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria''' is the highest [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] authority in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. It formulates the rules and regulations regarding matters of the church's organisation and faith.\n\nThe synod is chaired by the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Patriarch of Alexandria]] and the members are the church's [[metropolitan archbishop]]s, [[metropolitan bishop]]s, [[Bishop|diocesan bishops]], [[Exarch|patriarchal exarchs]], [[missionary Bishop]]s, [[auxiliary bishop]]s, [[suffragan bishop]]s, [[assistant bishop]]s, [[chorbishop]]s and the [[patriarch]]al [[vicar]]s of the Church of Alexandria.\n\n==Seniority==\n\nAccording to Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria traditions, the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope]], being the Bishop of Alexandria and being the senior and [[Elder (Christianity)|elder bishop]] and the [[metropolitan archbishop]] of the province and [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] of all Egypt, is the head of the Holy Synod as a [[first among equals]]. The most senior position after the Pope was that of the Metropolitan Archbishop of [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]], but since it ceased to be a major archiepiscopal metropolis in the days of [[Pope John VI of Alexandria|Pope John VI]] it has been held as a [[titular see]] attached to another metropolis.\n\nThere is a special status of seniority of honor and precedence for the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy and Great City of Our Lord, [[Jerusalem]], Holy Zion, [[Archbishop]] of the Holy [[Archdiocese]] of [[Jerusalem]], All [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Amman|Philadelphia of Jordan]] and All the [[Near East]].\n\nThis great archdiocesan Metropolis is technically outside the Egyptian Province and is not considered to be within the jurisdiction of the Pope of Alexandria, but is one of the possessions of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. It was created by [[Pope Cyril III of Alexandria|Pope Cyril III]] (1235-1243) in the thirteenth Century, which, at that time, had caused a dispute between the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch.<ref>History of the Coptic Church, [[Iris Habib Elmasry]]</ref> This was a very rare incident between the two sister churches as in general their relationship is one of the strongest between any two sister churches.<ref>History of the Coptic Orthodox Church, [[Abouna Menassa Elkomos Youhanna]] 1923</ref>\n\nAccording to the Alexandrine tradition, the  rank of [[metropolitan bishop]] is granted by the Pope to the [[diocesan bishop]]s under his jurisdiction on a personal status (In Personam) and not due to the size or importance of the bishop's eparchy; however, the rank of Metropolitan Archbishop is granted to those whose Archdioceses have historical importance and had or have more than one [[Suffragan Diocese]] within their territorial jurisdictions.\n\nThe Coptic Orthodox Metropolitan Archbishop of Jerusalem is the only Coptic Orthodox Hierarch who is consecrated as a Metropolitan Archbishop without being consecrated first as a bishop and later elevated to Metropolitan Archbishop, as is the norm in all episcopal consecration according to the tradition of the [[Church of Alexandria]]; it is done concurrently on the same occasion. This has been the case since [[Pope Cyril III of Alexandria|Cyril III]] consecrated Metropolitan Archbishop Basilius as the first Coptic Orthodox Metropolitan Archbishop of Jerusalem and All the Near East.\n\nUsually the chosen Hieromonk is consecrated first as a [[Diocesan Bishop]], then with time, he could be awarded the higher dignity of Metropolitan Bishop. Sometimes the nominated Diocesan Bishop is already an [[Assistant Bishop]], [[Auxiliary Bishop]] or General Bishop, in which case he is only enthroned as the bishop of that [[Diocese]].\n\nCurrently, and because the seniority of the members of the [[Holy Synod]] is decided according to the seniority of the consecretion/elevation date of the ecclesiastical ranks: First come the Metropolitan Archbishops and Metropolitan Bishops, followed by the Diocesan Bishops then the Bishops Exarchs of the Throne, then the [[Suffragan Bishop]]s, then the [[Auxiliary Bishop]]s, then the General Bishops and finally the [[Chorbishop]]s but also according to the date of consecration within each rank.\n\nAccordingly, the most senior position after the Pope is the oldest consecrated Metropolitan Archbishop, who was {{As of|2015|lc=y}} Metropolitan Pachomios, the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy Metropolis of [[Damanhur]] (Hermopolis Parva) and [[Al Buhayrah Governorate|Beheira]] (Consecrated in 1990).\n\nIn spite of the ancient Alexandrine tradition, the most senior Hierarch, after the Senior Hierarch of [[Pentapolis]], is the Hierarch of the Metropolis of ([[Lycopolis]]), ([[Hieracon]]) and ([[Apollonopolis Parva (Hypselis)|Apollonopolis Parva]]), which is [[Asyut]]; but since the great and ancient [[Titular see|Titular]] Metropolis of [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]] in ([[Cyrenaica]]), that comprises the Holy Suffragan Dioceses of ([[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]), ([[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Appollonia]]), ([[Ptolemais (Cyrenaica)|Ptolemais]]), ([[Benghazi|Berenice]]) and ([[Taucheira|Arsinoe]]), is currently a Titular title, incorporated within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy Metropolis of [[Al Buhayrah Governorate|Beheira]] ([[Damanhur|Hermopolis Parva]]), ([[Buto]]), ([[Naucratis]]), [[Lake Mariout|Mariout]] ([[Mareotis]]), [[Marsa Matruh]] ([[Paraetonium]]), ([[Apis (city)|Apis]]); who is also the [[Titular Archbishop]] and Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient and Holy Titular Archdiocese of [[Libya]], comprising the Titular Suffragan Dioceses of ([[Libu|Livis]], [[Darnis|Marmarica]], [[Darnis]], [[Leptis Magna|Neapolis]]  and [[Tripolitania]]); of the Ancient and Holy ([[Exarchate of Africa]]) in [[Tunisia]], comprising the Titular and Holy Suffragan Dioceses of ([[Mauretania Tingitana]]) and ([[Mauretania Caesariensis]]) and of the Ancient and Holy Titular Metropolis of ([[Kingdom of Numidia|Numedia]]) in [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]] that includes the Titular and Holy Suffragan Dioceses of ([[Leptis Parva]]) and of ([[Hadramentum]]). Accordingly, that honor goes to the Hierarch of the [[Metropolis]] of ([[Lycopolis]]), ([[Hieracon]]) and ([[Apollonopolis Parva (Hypselis)|Apollonopolis Parva]]) apart from the fact of the current adoption of the seniority of the date of consecration of the later Hierarch.\n\nThe most senior bishop in consecration will become the [[Locum tenens]] in case of the death of the Pope and until the election of the new Pope, and he will be the one who enthrones the newly elected [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope]] along with all the Hierarchs, who are members of the Holy Synod.\n \nThis seniority ranking system does not diminish the importance and the greatness of the Archdiocese of Jerusalem and [[Near East|All the Near East]], since its inclusion under the jurisdiction of the Apostolic [[Church of Alexandria]] in early medieval times. The archiepiscopal status of this great Metropolis is also granted due to the Holy Apostolic Throne that it represents, being the Apostolic and Patriarchal Throne of Jerusalem, although its Metropolitan Archbishop does not claim that title and is under the jurisdiction of the Holy Apostolic Throne of [[Alexandria]].\n\n==Gallery==\n[http://st-takla.org/Gallery/Coptic-Holy-Synod/Holy-Synod_Al-Magma3-Al-Kokaddas_01.html A Gallery of the Coptic Holy Synod of Egypt (All Coptic Bishops)]  '''(external link)'''\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20061217040706/http://www.theholysynod.copticpope.org/thumb.htm A Gallery of the Members of the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria] In order of date of consecration in Arabic and English  '''(external link)'''\n\n== Chair and members of the Synod ==\n\n===Pontiff===\n'''Chairman of The Synod'''\n \n1) [[Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria]]\n\n*[[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope and Lord Archbishop of the Great and Holy Metropolitan Archdiocese of Alexandria]] ([[Rhakotis]]), being:\n**The Metropolitan of the Holy, Great and Ancient Metropolitan Archdiocese of [[Alexandria]] ([[Rhakotis]]), comprising:\n***The Great and Ancient Metropolis of [[Alexandria]], which includes:\n****The Titular and Holy [[Suffragan Diocese]] of [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]] ([[Aboukir]]).\n****The Titular and Holy Suffragan Diocese of [[Canopus, Egypt|Menelaus]].\n****The Titular and Holy Suffragan Diocese of [[Canopus, Egypt|Schedia]].\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of El-Montazah District.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of the Western District\n**The Metropolitan of the Metropolitan Province of Greater [[Cairo]] comprising:\n***The Holy Archdiocese of Cairo ([[Arcadia \u00c6gypti]]), which includes:\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of East of the Railroad District in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of Dar El Salam (Irinipolis) in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of Central (Down Town) Cairo and of [[Heliopolis (Cairo Suburb)|Heliopolis]] in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of Ezbet El Nakhl in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of [[Old Cairo]] ([[Babylon (Egypt)|Babylon]]), Manial and Fum El Khalig in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of El-Mokattam Mountain in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of Northern & Southern Shoubra in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of Hadayek El-Kobba, El-Wailly & Mansheyat El-Sadr in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of El-Hagana & Almaza in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of Ain Shams & El-Matareya in Cairo.\n**The [[Archbishop|Metropolitan Archbishop]] of the Archdiocese of North America, which includes:\n***The Holy Suffragan Diocese of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] and all [[Virginia]], USA\n*[[Elder (religious)|Elder and Chief]] Metropolitan Archbishop of all the Egyptian [[Ecclesiastical Province|Province]]s.\n*[[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of all [[Egypt]], [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]], [[Libya]], [[Nubia]] and the [[Sudan]].\n*[[Patriarch of Alexandria|Patriarch of All Africa]] on the [[Cathedra|Throne]] of the [[Apostolic See]] of [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark the Evangelist]], the [[Twelve Apostles|Holy Apostle]] and [[Martyr]].\n\n===Metropolitans Archbishops of the Throne and Metropolitan Bishops of the Throne===\n\n2) Antonios, Most Senior and Elder Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy and Great City of Our Lord, Jerusalem (Holy Zion);

Bishop Sarabamoun on March 8, 2020)\n\n==Definition of Hierarchical titles according to the Alexandrine Tradition==\n\n===Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria===\n[[Pontiff]] and Supreme [[Hierarch]] of the Holy Orthodox & Apostolic Throne of Alexandria. He is considered [[First among equals]] (primus inter pares) on his [[Apostolic See|Apostolic Throne]].  He presides over the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and over all Patriarchal Institutions.  He is also the Head of the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]].\n\nHe consecrates, crowns and enthrones Patriarchs and Catholicoi (within his Dominion/Jurisdiction in Africa).  He consecrates and crowns Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops, and delegates several Metropolitans and Bishops to enthrone them.  He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons, all minor Orders, all ranks of Monastics, elevates Bishops to the Metropolitan, the Archiepiscopal or the Patriarchal Dignity. He consecrates the Holy Myron. He also bestows the honor of the Great Schema upon the Monastics who have achieved the highest degree of asceticism in Monastic life or upon those who are to be ordained to the Episcopal Rank.\n\nHe anoints, crowns and enthrones Orthodox Emperors and Empresses, Orthodox Kings and Queens. He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries, holy vessels and vestments. He has the First and the Highest Rank of the Episcopal Dignity of the Holy Apostolic Throne of Alexandria. He is the Primate of the second highest Apostolic Throne, in accordance with the Canon Laws of the Ecumenical Council of Nicea (325 AD), after Imperial Rome.  The Throne of Alexandria later became third in rank, after the Imperial Cities of Rome and Constantinople, New Rome, in accordance with the Canon Laws of the Ecumenical Council of Constantinople (381AD).\n\n===Metropolitans Archbishops and Metropolitan Bishops===\nAdministrative Title of the Episcopal Rank for a large Diocese or Eparchy, bestowed upon a Diocesan Bishop by the Patriarch, in recognition for his long service in his Diocese/Eparchy. It can also be granted due to the extended size of a Diocese or an Eparchy (by becoming an Archdiocese or an Archeparchy,) thus forming or is considered as an Ecclesiastical province, which requires its Prelate to be elevated to the Metropolitan /Archiepiscopal Dignity.\n\nThe higher Title of Metropolitan Bishop/Metropolitan Archbishop is granted to the Bishop of the Metropolis. He may oversee several Suffragan Bishops (to each his own Diocese) within his province, Auxiliary Bishops (Assistant to the Hierarch) and/or Chori-Episcopoi, under his jurisdiction.\n\nThe title of Metropolitan Archbishop is granted to the Hierarch of the Metropolis that has a historical dignity within the Throne, and whose Bishop ought to have the honorary dignity of a Metropolitan Archbishop, like Metropolitan Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Jerusalem, All [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Amman|Philadelphia of Jordan]] and [[Exarch|Patriarchal Exarch]] of all the [[Near East]] and the Metropolitan Archbishop and Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient Archdiocese of [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]] in ([[Cyrenaica]]), comprising the [[Suffragan Diocese]]s of: ([[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]), ([[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Appollonia]]),([[Ptolemais (Cyrenaica)|Ptolemais]]),  ([[Benghazi|Berenice]]) and ([[Taucheira|Arsinoe]]), who is also the Metropolitan Archbishop and Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient Archdiocese of [[Libya]], comprising the [[Suffragan Diocese]]s of: ([[Libu|Livis]], [[Darnis|Marmarica]], [[Darnis]] and [[Tripolitania]]).\n\nHe is called Metropolitan in his own Diocesan City, the Metropolis and is called Archbishop in all the other [[Suffragan Diocese]]s, whose Suffragan Bishops are under his jurisdiction.  Whereas, the Metropolitan Bishop is called Metropolitan in his own Diocesan City with its jurisdictions, which as a whole is considered a Metropolis, according to the jurisdictional subdivision of the Church, and he may have Assistant Bishops or Auxiliary Bishops under his jurisdiction, but does not have [[Suffragan Diocese]]s, headed by Suffragan Bishops, under his jurisdiction.\n \nHe assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops.  He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes in his Diocese or Eparchy.  He bestows the honor of the Great Schema upon the Monastics who have achieved the highest degree of Monastic life or upon those who are to be ordained to the Episcopal Rank and ordain novices to the monastic rank for the monasteries under his jurisdiction. He assists the Patriarch in consecrating the Holy Myron. He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries and holy vessels and vestments in his Diocese or Eparchy.\n\nHe exercises the same authority in his Metropolis and its jurisdiction as the Patriarch on his Throne. He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch.  In the case of the departure of the Patriarch, the Senior Metropolitan in ordination, acts as Locum Tenens of the Throne, until the election of the new Patriarch, whom he will enthrone, along with the entire body of the Hierarchy of the Throne.  During that time, no ordination of new Hierarchs, no consecration of the Holy Myron, no new Patriarchal decrees or alteration of previous Patriarchal or Holy Synod decrees can be made. He is Second in Rank in the Episcopal Dignity.\n\n===Diocesan or Eparchial Bishop===\n\nHierarch chosen to oversee a Diocese or an [[Eparchy]], whether this Diocese or [[Eparchy]] is a subdivision of the Patriarchate or a subdivision of a greater Province, ruled by a Metropolitan Archbishop (which, in this case these are called Suffragan Bishops.)  He is the Shepherd of his flock. He has the right to consecrate parishes, altars, baptisteries and all ecclesiastical foundations.  He assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops. He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes of his Diocese or Eparchy.\n\nHe bestows the honor of the Great Schema upon the Monastics who have achieved the highest degree of Monastic life or upon those who are to be consecrated to the Episcopal Rank and ordain novices to the monastic rank for the monasteries under his jurisdiction. He assists the Patriarch in consecrating the Holy Myron.  He also consecrates, within his Diocese or Eparchy, all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries, holy vessels and vestments.\n\nHe exercises the same authority in his Diocese as the Patriarch on his Throne. He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch.  He is Third in Rank in the Episcopal Dignity.\n\n===General Bishop/Exarch of the Throne===\n\nHierarch who does not have a jurisdiction over a particular Diocese and who is given a temporary Patriarchal assignment to shepherd or supervise either a particular district/portion of the Patriarchal Diocese or on \"at large\"  designation as a delegate assistant to the Hierarch.  He can also be serving within the Patriarchal Diocese/Jurisdiction, shepherding multiple congregations.  He can also supervise an area or a region that has not yet been designated or established as a Diocese, thus acting as an Exarch of the Throne. In this case, he is considered as a [[Patriarchal Vicar]] if assigned within Egypt (the Mother Church) or as a Patriarchal Exarch of the Throne if assigned outside Egypt for certain duration.\n\nHe also can be the administrator of a [[Diocese|Bishopric]] (i.e. the Youth, Social & Ecumenical Services, Scientific Research & Higher Coptic Studies Bishoprics), which are patriarchal organizations headed by a General Bishop concerned with social, educational and spiritual care of the members of the patriarchate at large or of a Patriarchal Institution (the Patriarchal Print Shop, or the Patriarchal Secretariat). In this capacity, he is the Administrator of this particular Bishopric or Patriarchal Institution. He assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops.  He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes with Patriarchal permission within the province, which are directly under the Patriarchal jurisdiction, whether within Egypt or outside Egypt, when delegated .\n\nHe assists the Patriarch in consecrating the Holy Myron.  He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries and holy vessels and vestments by Patriarchal delegation. He reports directly to the Patriarch.  He has the same Episcopal Authority and Dignity as a regular Bishop.\n\nHe can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch,  and in this case he is given the title of Bishop Abbot, and ceases to be a General Bishop or Exarch of the Throne. The Title of General Bishop is not in conformity with the Holy and Apostolic Canon Laws of the Orthodox Church. On the other hand, an Exarch was and still is a permissible form of Patriarchal delegation or representation.\n\n===Auxiliary Bishop/Assistant Bishop/Suffragan Bishop===\n\nA Suffragan Hierarch who has been delegated by the Patriarch or a Metropolitan Archbishop to serve a district or part of the Patriarchal or Metropolitan Archdiocese or jurisdiction, or a suffragan diocese to the Metropolitan Archdiocese; if suffragan diocese is in question based on a quasi-permanent, occasional or as a temporal helper, then it is within Patriarchal diocesan jurisdiction, although in this case, he would be called Assistant Bishop.  He shepherds the congregation of that particular diocese (if suffragan) or district (if within the patriarchal diocese), reporting directly to the Metropolitan Archbishop or the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church|Pope of Alexandria]] respectively.\n\nHe can also be assigned as an assistant by the Pope of Alexandria to help a Metropolitan Bishop in his Metropolitanate, which is not divided into smaller subdivisions of suffragan dioceses, and based upon the Metropolitan Bishop's or the Metropolitan Archbishop's request, if the latter requires an assistant. In this case, he is called an Assistant Bishop, he reports to the Diocesan [[Hierarch]], i.e. the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop.\n\nHe does not, however, inherit (takeover) the Metropolis after the departure of the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop. In the case that this Bishop is chosen as a \"[[Coadjutor Bishop]]\" to a particular Metropolis/Archdiocese or a [[Suffragan Diocese]] of the Metropolis in the capacity of [[Coadjutor Bishop]], in assistance to the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop, thus being second in command; then he has the right of succession when the latter reposes in the Lord.  However, this form of governance is not favored and seldom applied nowadays in the Alexandrine tradition.\n\nIf the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop of a large Metropolis or Archdiocese is in need of one or more general helper in all kinds of services and to delegate to serve or shepherd all over the jurisdiction of the aforementioned Hierarch, then the chosen Bishop/s is/are called [[Auxiliary Bishop]]/s to the Hierarch in these capacities.\n\nThe idea of having more than one Bishop shepherding a particular Diocese/Metropolitanate/Archdiocese is against the Canon Laws of the Church. This, however has been, recently, adapted and ratified by local Synodical Decrees, on the basis that the Auxiliary Bishop is assigned to a Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop within his Province, for a specific district or region (being too small to be considered as a suffragan diocese), as a means for better serving the congregation of a large Diocese. In this case, the large Diocese is considered as a Province. These Auxiliary Bishops are considered to the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Province as the Bishops of the Patriarchate are to the Patriarch within his Patriarchate. If the Metropolis or the Archdiocese has one or more [[suffragan diocese]] within its jurisdiction, then the appointment of Suffragan Bishops is a canonically accepted measure to extend the proper episcopal shepherding to this/these suffragan diocese(s).\n\nThese appointments are reasoned in the following cases: \n*The Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop, being the Hierarch of a large region or jurisdiction, which includes many cities and their suburbs, that could be divided into more than one diocese within the Metropolis and since he reserves the right to be the [[Diocesan Bishop]], meaning the (Shepherd) of the main city ([[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|the Metropolis]]) of his Archeparchial Province, he appoints Suffragan Bishops for these dioceses.\n*Due to the age or physical health of the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop, an Auxiliary Bishop is then appointed to serve a part of the Metropolis /Archdiocese or an Assistant Bishop is appointed as a general assistant to the ruling Hierarch.\n\nThe Auxiliary Bishop/Suffragan Bishop/Assistant Bishop assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops. He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes of his District, Diocese or Eparchy.  He assists the Patriarch, and all the Metropolitans and all the Bishops in consecrating the Holy Myron. He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries, holy vessels and vestments by Patriarchal, Archiepiscopal or Metropolitan delegation.  He has the same Episcopal Authority and Dignity as a regular Bishop.\n\n===Titular Bishop===\n\nA Hierarch, who is given the title for a defunct Diocese, in commemoration of its historical status.  In the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria, it has been the custom to give this title to a Metropolitan Bishop or a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop who already shepherds an active Archdiocese or [[Diocese]]. It would be considered a part of his ecclesiastical jurisdiction; rather than having a Metropolitan Bishop or a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop overseeing a defunct Diocese, with no real congregation of its own (i.e.  Pentapolis and Nubia).\n\nHe assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops.  He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes of his Diocese or Eparchy. (Being already a Diocesan Metropolitan or Bishop as mentioned above).\n\nHe has the same Episcopal Authority and Dignity as any regular Bishop or Metropolitan (since in this case, he is in fact a Diocesan Bishop/Metropolitan).  He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch, and in this case, he can keep his title of Titular Bishop, side by side with his title of Bishop Abbot.\n\n===Chorbishop (Chori-Episcopus)===\n\nAn episcopal rank given for a Hierarch of a small town or village, under the jurisdiction of a Metropolitan Bishop, a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop. He has the same ecclesiastical authority as that of the other Hierarchs. The exception is that he is to ordain Priests or Deacons and all Minor Orders, to consecrate holy vessels, altars, baptisteries or Churches only in his village or town and only with the authorization of the Patriarch, if assigned within the Patriarchal Diocese, or that of a Metropolitan Bishop, a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop of the Metropolis/Diocese, in which his town or village is.\n\nThis special Patriarchal, Metropolitan or Episcopal permission is essential for the above-mentioned ordinations and consecrations.  He cannot do the above-mentioned consecration outside his assigned jurisdiction, or even within the main Diocesan cities of the province he serves in.\n\nHe assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops by Episcopal permission of the ruling hierarch of the Provincial Diocese or Eparchy, in which he is serving.\n\nHe also has no jurisdiction over the Priests or Archpriests of the Major or Capital Cities within the Province where his town or village is located.

It formulates the rules and regulations regarding matters of the church's organisation and faith.\n\nThe synod is chaired by the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Patriarch of Alexandria]] and the members are the church's [[metropolitan archbishop]]s, [[metropolitan bishop]]s, [[Bishop|diocesan bishops]], [[Exarch|patriarchal exarchs]], [[missionary Bishop]]s, [[auxiliary bishop]]s, [[suffragan bishop]]s, [[assistant bishop]]s, [[chorbishop]]s and the [[patriarch]]al [[vicar]]s of the Church of Alexandria.\n\n==Seniority==\n\nAccording to Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria traditions, the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope]], being the Bishop of Alexandria and being the senior and [[Elder (Christianity)|elder bishop]] and the [[metropolitan archbishop]] of the province and [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] of all Egypt, is the head of the Holy Synod as a [[first among equals]]. The most senior position after the Pope was that of the Metropolitan Archbishop of [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]], but since it ceased to be a major archiepiscopal metropolis in the days of [[Pope John VI of Alexandria|Pope John VI]] it has been held as a [[titular see]] attached to another metropolis.\n\nThere is a special status of seniority of honor and precedence for the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy and Great City of Our Lord, [[Jerusalem]], Holy Zion, [[Archbishop]] of the Holy [[Archdiocese]] of [[Jerusalem]], All [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Amman|Philadelphia of Jordan]] and All the [[Near East]].\n\nThis great archdiocesan Metropolis is technically outside the Egyptian Province and is not considered to be within the jurisdiction of the Pope of Alexandria, but is one of the possessions of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. It was created by [[Pope Cyril III of Alexandria|Pope Cyril III]] (1235-1243) in the thirteenth Century, which, at that time, had caused a dispute between the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch.<ref>History of the Coptic Church, [[Iris Habib Elmasry]]</ref> This was a very rare incident between the two sister churches as in general their relationship is one of the strongest between any two sister churches.<ref>History of the Coptic Orthodox Church, [[Abouna Menassa Elkomos Youhanna]] 1923</ref>\n\nAccording to the Alexandrine tradition, the  rank of [[metropolitan bishop]] is granted by the Pope to the [[diocesan bishop]]s under his jurisdiction on a personal status (In Personam) and not due to the size or importance of the bishop's eparchy; however, the rank of Metropolitan Archbishop is granted to those whose Archdioceses have historical importance and had or have more than one [[Suffragan Diocese]] within their territorial jurisdictions.\n\nThe Coptic Orthodox Metropolitan Archbishop of Jerusalem is the only Coptic Orthodox Hierarch who is consecrated as a Metropolitan Archbishop without being consecrated first as a bishop and later elevated to Metropolitan Archbishop, as is the norm in all episcopal consecration according to the tradition of the [[Church of Alexandria]]; it is done concurrently on the same occasion. This has been the case since [[Pope Cyril III of Alexandria|Cyril III]] consecrated Metropolitan Archbishop Basilius as the first Coptic Orthodox Metropolitan Archbishop of Jerusalem and All the Near East.\n\nUsually the chosen Hieromonk is consecrated first as a [[Diocesan Bishop]], then with time, he could be awarded the higher dignity of Metropolitan Bishop. Sometimes the nominated Diocesan Bishop is already an [[Assistant Bishop]], [[Auxiliary Bishop]] or General Bishop, in which case he is only enthroned as the bishop of that [[Diocese]].\n\nCurrently, and because the seniority of the members of the [[Holy Synod]] is decided according to the seniority of the consecretion/elevation date of the ecclesiastical ranks: First come the Metropolitan Archbishops and Metropolitan Bishops, followed by the Diocesan Bishops then the Bishops Exarchs of the Throne, then the [[Suffragan Bishop]]s, then the [[Auxiliary Bishop]]s, then the General Bishops and finally the [[Chorbishop]]s but also according to the date of consecration within each rank.\n\nAccordingly, the most senior position after the Pope is the oldest consecrated Metropolitan Archbishop, who was {{As of|2015|lc=y}} Metropolitan Pachomios, the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy Metropolis of [[Damanhur]] (Hermopolis Parva) and [[Al Buhayrah Governorate|Beheira]] (Consecrated in 1990).\n\nIn spite of the ancient Alexandrine tradition, the most senior Hierarch, after the Senior Hierarch of [[Pentapolis]], is the Hierarch of the Metropolis of ([[Lycopolis]]), ([[Hieracon]]) and ([[Apollonopolis Parva (Hypselis)|Apollonopolis Parva]]), which is [[Asyut]]; but since the great and ancient [[Titular see|Titular]] Metropolis of [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]] in ([[Cyrenaica]]), that comprises the Holy Suffragan Dioceses of ([[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]), ([[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Appollonia]]), ([[Ptolemais (Cyrenaica)|Ptolemais]]), ([[Benghazi|Berenice]]) and ([[Taucheira|Arsinoe]]), is currently a Titular title, incorporated within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy Metropolis of [[Al Buhayrah Governorate|Beheira]] ([[Damanhur|Hermopolis Parva]]), ([[Buto]]), ([[Naucratis]]), [[Lake Mariout|Mariout]] ([[Mareotis]]), [[Marsa Matruh]] ([[Paraetonium]]), ([[Apis (city)|Apis]]); who is also the [[Titular Archbishop]] and Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient and Holy Titular Archdiocese of [[Libya]], comprising the Titular Suffragan Dioceses of ([[Libu|Livis]], [[Darnis|Marmarica]], [[Darnis]], [[Leptis Magna|Neapolis]]  and [[Tripolitania]]); of the Ancient and Holy ([[Exarchate of Africa]]) in [[Tunisia]], comprising the Titular and Holy Suffragan Dioceses of ([[Mauretania Tingitana]]) and ([[Mauretania Caesariensis]]) and of the Ancient and Holy Titular Metropolis of ([[Kingdom of Numidia|Numedia]]) in [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]] that includes the Titular and Holy Suffragan Dioceses of ([[Leptis Parva]]) and of ([[Hadramentum]]). Accordingly, that honor goes to the Hierarch of the [[Metropolis]] of ([[Lycopolis]]), ([[Hieracon]]) and ([[Apollonopolis Parva (Hypselis)|Apollonopolis Parva]]) apart from the fact of the current adoption of the seniority of the date of consecration of the later Hierarch.\n\nThe most senior bishop in consecration will become the [[Locum tenens]] in case of the death of the Pope and until the election of the new Pope, and he will be the one who enthrones the newly elected [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope]] along with all the Hierarchs, who are members of the Holy Synod.\n \nThis seniority ranking system does not diminish the importance and the greatness of the Archdiocese of Jerusalem and [[Near East|All the Near East]], since its inclusion under the jurisdiction of the Apostolic [[Church of Alexandria]] in early medieval times. The archiepiscopal status of this great Metropolis is also granted due to the Holy Apostolic Throne that it represents, being the Apostolic and Patriarchal Throne of Jerusalem, although its Metropolitan Archbishop does not claim that title and is under the jurisdiction of the Holy Apostolic Throne of [[Alexandria]].\n\n==Gallery==\n[http://st-takla.org/Gallery/Coptic-Holy-Synod/Holy-Synod_Al-Magma3-Al-Kokaddas_01.html A Gallery of the Coptic Holy Synod of Egypt (All Coptic Bishops)]  '''(external link)'''\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20061217040706/http://www.theholysynod.copticpope.org/thumb.htm A Gallery of the Members of the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria] In order of date of consecration in Arabic and English  '''(external link)'''\n\n== Chair and members of the Synod ==\n\n===Pontiff===\n'''Chairman of The Synod'''\n \n1) [[Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria]]\n\n*[[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope and Lord Archbishop of the Great and Holy Metropolitan Archdiocese of Alexandria]] ([[Rhakotis]]), being:\n**The Metropolitan of the Holy, Great and Ancient Metropolitan Archdiocese of [[Alexandria]] ([[Rhakotis]]), comprising:\n***The Great and Ancient Metropolis of [[Alexandria]], which includes:\n****The Titular and Holy [[Suffragan Diocese]] of [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]] ([[Aboukir]]).\n****The Titular and Holy Suffragan Diocese of [[Canopus, Egypt|Menelaus]].\n****The Titular and Holy Suffragan Diocese of [[Canopus, Egypt|Schedia]].\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of El-Montazah District.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of the Western District\n**The Metropolitan of the Metropolitan Province of Greater [[Cairo]] comprising:\n***The Holy Archdiocese of Cairo ([[Arcadia \u00c6gypti]]), which includes:\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of East of the Railroad District in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of Dar El Salam (Irinipolis) in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of Central (Down Town) Cairo and of [[Heliopolis (Cairo Suburb)|Heliopolis]] in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of Ezbet El Nakhl in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of [[Old Cairo]] ([[Babylon (Egypt)|Babylon]]), Manial and Fum El Khalig in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of El-Mokattam Mountain in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of Northern & Southern Shoubra in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of Hadayek El-Kobba, El-Wailly & Mansheyat El-Sadr in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of El-Hagana & Almaza in Cairo.\n****The Holy Suffragan Diocese of Ain Shams & El-Matareya in Cairo.\n**The [[Archbishop|Metropolitan Archbishop]] of the Archdiocese of North America, which includes:\n***The Holy Suffragan Diocese of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] and all [[Virginia]], USA\n*[[Elder (religious)|Elder and Chief]] Metropolitan Archbishop of all the Egyptian [[Ecclesiastical Province|Province]]s.\n*[[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of all [[Egypt]], [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]], [[Libya]], [[Nubia]] and the [[Sudan]].\n*[[Patriarch of Alexandria|Patriarch of All Africa]] on the [[Cathedra|Throne]] of the [[Apostolic See]] of [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark the Evangelist]], the [[Twelve Apostles|Holy Apostle]] and [[Martyr]].\n\n===Metropolitans Archbishops of the Throne and Metropolitan Bishops of the Throne===\n\n2) Antonios, Most Senior and Elder Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy and Great City of Our Lord, Jerusalem (Holy Zion);

Bishop Sarabamoun on March 8, 2020)\n\n==Definition of Hierarchical titles according to the Alexandrine Tradition==\n\n===Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria===\n[[Pontiff]] and Supreme [[Hierarch]] of the Holy Orthodox & Apostolic Throne of Alexandria. He is considered [[First among equals]] (primus inter pares) on his [[Apostolic See|Apostolic Throne]].  He presides over the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and over all Patriarchal Institutions.  He is also the Head of the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]].\n\nHe consecrates, crowns and enthrones Patriarchs and Catholicoi (within his Dominion/Jurisdiction in Africa).  He consecrates and crowns Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops, and delegates several Metropolitans and Bishops to enthrone them.  He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons, all minor Orders, all ranks of Monastics, elevates Bishops to the Metropolitan, the Archiepiscopal or the Patriarchal Dignity. He consecrates the Holy Myron. He also bestows the honor of the Great Schema upon the Monastics who have achieved the highest degree of asceticism in Monastic life or upon those who are to be ordained to the Episcopal Rank.\n\nHe anoints, crowns and enthrones Orthodox Emperors and Empresses, Orthodox Kings and Queens. He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries, holy vessels and vestments. He has the First and the Highest Rank of the Episcopal Dignity of the Holy Apostolic Throne of Alexandria. He is the Primate of the second highest Apostolic Throne, in accordance with the Canon Laws of the Ecumenical Council of Nicea (325 AD), after Imperial Rome.  The Throne of Alexandria later became third in rank, after the Imperial Cities of Rome and Constantinople, New Rome, in accordance with the Canon Laws of the Ecumenical Council of Constantinople (381AD).\n\n===Metropolitans Archbishops and Metropolitan Bishops===\nAdministrative Title of the Episcopal Rank for a large Diocese or Eparchy, bestowed upon a Diocesan Bishop by the Patriarch, in recognition for his long service in his Diocese/Eparchy. It can also be granted due to the extended size of a Diocese or an Eparchy (by becoming an Archdiocese or an Archeparchy,) thus forming or is considered as an Ecclesiastical province, which requires its Prelate to be elevated to the Metropolitan /Archiepiscopal Dignity.\n\nThe higher Title of Metropolitan Bishop/Metropolitan Archbishop is granted to the Bishop of the Metropolis. He may oversee several Suffragan Bishops (to each his own Diocese) within his province, Auxiliary Bishops (Assistant to the Hierarch) and/or Chori-Episcopoi, under his jurisdiction.\n\nThe title of Metropolitan Archbishop is granted to the Hierarch of the Metropolis that has a historical dignity within the Throne, and whose Bishop ought to have the honorary dignity of a Metropolitan Archbishop, like Metropolitan Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Jerusalem, All [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Amman|Philadelphia of Jordan]] and [[Exarch|Patriarchal Exarch]] of all the [[Near East]] and the Metropolitan Archbishop and Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient Archdiocese of [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]] in ([[Cyrenaica]]), comprising the [[Suffragan Diocese]]s of: ([[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]), ([[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Appollonia]]),([[Ptolemais (Cyrenaica)|Ptolemais]]),  ([[Benghazi|Berenice]]) and ([[Taucheira|Arsinoe]]), who is also the Metropolitan Archbishop and Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient Archdiocese of [[Libya]], comprising the [[Suffragan Diocese]]s of: ([[Libu|Livis]], [[Darnis|Marmarica]], [[Darnis]] and [[Tripolitania]]).\n\nHe is called Metropolitan in his own Diocesan City, the Metropolis and is called Archbishop in all the other [[Suffragan Diocese]]s, whose Suffragan Bishops are under his jurisdiction.  Whereas, the Metropolitan Bishop is called Metropolitan in his own Diocesan City with its jurisdictions, which as a whole is considered a Metropolis, according to the jurisdictional subdivision of the Church, and he may have Assistant Bishops or Auxiliary Bishops under his jurisdiction, but does not have [[Suffragan Diocese]]s, headed by Suffragan Bishops, under his jurisdiction.\n \nHe assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops.  He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes in his Diocese or Eparchy.  He bestows the honor of the Great Schema upon the Monastics who have achieved the highest degree of Monastic life or upon those who are to be ordained to the Episcopal Rank and ordain novices to the monastic rank for the monasteries under his jurisdiction. He assists the Patriarch in consecrating the Holy Myron. He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries and holy vessels and vestments in his Diocese or Eparchy.\n\nHe exercises the same authority in his Metropolis and its jurisdiction as the Patriarch on his Throne. He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch.  In the case of the departure of the Patriarch, the Senior Metropolitan in ordination, acts as Locum Tenens of the Throne, until the election of the new Patriarch, whom he will enthrone, along with the entire body of the Hierarchy of the Throne.  During that time, no ordination of new Hierarchs, no consecration of the Holy Myron, no new Patriarchal decrees or alteration of previous Patriarchal or Holy Synod decrees can be made. He is Second in Rank in the Episcopal Dignity.\n\n===Diocesan or Eparchial Bishop===\n\nHierarch chosen to oversee a Diocese or an [[Eparchy]], whether this Diocese or [[Eparchy]] is a subdivision of the Patriarchate or a subdivision of a greater Province, ruled by a Metropolitan Archbishop (which, in this case these are called Suffragan Bishops.)  He is the Shepherd of his flock. He has the right to consecrate parishes, altars, baptisteries and all ecclesiastical foundations.  He assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops. He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes of his Diocese or Eparchy.\n\nHe bestows the honor of the Great Schema upon the Monastics who have achieved the highest degree of Monastic life or upon those who are to be consecrated to the Episcopal Rank and ordain novices to the monastic rank for the monasteries under his jurisdiction. He assists the Patriarch in consecrating the Holy Myron.  He also consecrates, within his Diocese or Eparchy, all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries, holy vessels and vestments.\n\nHe exercises the same authority in his Diocese as the Patriarch on his Throne. He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch.  He is Third in Rank in the Episcopal Dignity.\n\n===General Bishop/Exarch of the Throne===\n\nHierarch who does not have a jurisdiction over a particular Diocese and who is given a temporary Patriarchal assignment to shepherd or supervise either a particular district/portion of the Patriarchal Diocese or on \"at large\"  designation as a delegate assistant to the Hierarch.  He can also be serving within the Patriarchal Diocese/Jurisdiction, shepherding multiple congregations.  He can also supervise an area or a region that has not yet been designated or established as a Diocese, thus acting as an Exarch of the Throne. In this case, he is considered as a [[Patriarchal Vicar]] if assigned within Egypt (the Mother Church) or as a Patriarchal Exarch of the Throne if assigned outside Egypt for certain duration.\n\nHe also can be the administrator of a [[Diocese|Bishopric]] (i.e. the Youth, Social & Ecumenical Services, Scientific Research & Higher Coptic Studies Bishoprics), which are patriarchal organizations headed by a General Bishop concerned with social, educational and spiritual care of the members of the patriarchate at large or of a Patriarchal Institution (the Patriarchal Print Shop, or the Patriarchal Secretariat). In this capacity, he is the Administrator of this particular Bishopric or Patriarchal Institution. He assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops.  He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes with Patriarchal permission within the province, which are directly under the Patriarchal jurisdiction, whether within Egypt or outside Egypt, when delegated .\n\nHe assists the Patriarch in consecrating the Holy Myron.  He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries and holy vessels and vestments by Patriarchal delegation. He reports directly to the Patriarch.  He has the same Episcopal Authority and Dignity as a regular Bishop.\n\nHe can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch,  and in this case he is given the title of Bishop Abbot, and ceases to be a General Bishop or Exarch of the Throne. The Title of General Bishop is not in conformity with the Holy and Apostolic Canon Laws of the Orthodox Church. On the other hand, an Exarch was and still is a permissible form of Patriarchal delegation or representation.\n\n===Auxiliary Bishop/Assistant Bishop/Suffragan Bishop===\n\nA Suffragan Hierarch who has been delegated by the Patriarch or a Metropolitan Archbishop to serve a district or part of the Patriarchal or Metropolitan Archdiocese or jurisdiction, or a suffragan diocese to the Metropolitan Archdiocese; if suffragan diocese is in question based on a quasi-permanent, occasional or as a temporal helper, then it is within Patriarchal diocesan jurisdiction, although in this case, he would be called Assistant Bishop.  He shepherds the congregation of that particular diocese (if suffragan) or district (if within the patriarchal diocese), reporting directly to the Metropolitan Archbishop or the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church|Pope of Alexandria]] respectively.\n\nHe can also be assigned as an assistant by the Pope of Alexandria to help a Metropolitan Bishop in his Metropolitanate, which is not divided into smaller subdivisions of suffragan dioceses, and based upon the Metropolitan Bishop's or the Metropolitan Archbishop's request, if the latter requires an assistant. In this case, he is called an Assistant Bishop, he reports to the Diocesan [[Hierarch]], i.e. the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop.\n\nHe does not, however, inherit (takeover) the Metropolis after the departure of the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop. In the case that this Bishop is chosen as a \"[[Coadjutor Bishop]]\" to a particular Metropolis/Archdiocese or a [[Suffragan Diocese]] of the Metropolis in the capacity of [[Coadjutor Bishop]], in assistance to the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop, thus being second in command; then he has the right of succession when the latter reposes in the Lord.  However, this form of governance is not favored and seldom applied nowadays in the Alexandrine tradition.\n\nIf the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop of a large Metropolis or Archdiocese is in need of one or more general helper in all kinds of services and to delegate to serve or shepherd all over the jurisdiction of the aforementioned Hierarch, then the chosen Bishop/s is/are called [[Auxiliary Bishop]]/s to the Hierarch in these capacities.\n\nThe idea of having more than one Bishop shepherding a particular Diocese/Metropolitanate/Archdiocese is against the Canon Laws of the Church. This, however has been, recently, adapted and ratified by local Synodical Decrees, on the basis that the Auxiliary Bishop is assigned to a Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop within his Province, for a specific district or region (being too small to be considered as a suffragan diocese), as a means for better serving the congregation of a large Diocese. In this case, the large Diocese is considered as a Province. These Auxiliary Bishops are considered to the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Province as the Bishops of the Patriarchate are to the Patriarch within his Patriarchate. If the Metropolis or the Archdiocese has one or more [[suffragan diocese]] within its jurisdiction, then the appointment of Suffragan Bishops is a canonically accepted measure to extend the proper episcopal shepherding to this/these suffragan diocese(s).\n\nThese appointments are reasoned in the following cases: \n*The Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop, being the Hierarch of a large region or jurisdiction, which includes many cities and their suburbs, that could be divided into more than one diocese within the Metropolis and since he reserves the right to be the [[Diocesan Bishop]], meaning the (Shepherd) of the main city ([[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|the Metropolis]]) of his Archeparchial Province, he appoints Suffragan Bishops for these dioceses.\n*Due to the age or physical health of the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop, an Auxiliary Bishop is then appointed to serve a part of the Metropolis /Archdiocese or an Assistant Bishop is appointed as a general assistant to the ruling Hierarch.\n\nThe Auxiliary Bishop/Suffragan Bishop/Assistant Bishop assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops. He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes of his District, Diocese or Eparchy.  He assists the Patriarch, and all the Metropolitans and all the Bishops in consecrating the Holy Myron. He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries, holy vessels and vestments by Patriarchal, Archiepiscopal or Metropolitan delegation.  He has the same Episcopal Authority and Dignity as a regular Bishop.\n\n===Titular Bishop===\n\nA Hierarch, who is given the title for a defunct Diocese, in commemoration of its historical status.  In the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria, it has been the custom to give this title to a Metropolitan Bishop or a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop who already shepherds an active Archdiocese or [[Diocese]]. It would be considered a part of his ecclesiastical jurisdiction; rather than having a Metropolitan Bishop or a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop overseeing a defunct Diocese, with no real congregation of its own (i.e.  Pentapolis and Nubia).\n\nHe assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops.  He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes of his Diocese or Eparchy. (Being already a Diocesan Metropolitan or Bishop as mentioned above).\n\nHe has the same Episcopal Authority and Dignity as any regular Bishop or Metropolitan (since in this case, he is in fact a Diocesan Bishop/Metropolitan).  He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch, and in this case, he can keep his title of Titular Bishop, side by side with his title of Bishop Abbot.\n\n===Chorbishop (Chori-Episcopus)===\n\nAn episcopal rank given for a Hierarch of a small town or village, under the jurisdiction of a Metropolitan Bishop, a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop. He has the same ecclesiastical authority as that of the other Hierarchs. The exception is that he is to ordain Priests or Deacons and all Minor Orders, to consecrate holy vessels, altars, baptisteries or Churches only in his village or town and only with the authorization of the Patriarch, if assigned within the Patriarchal Diocese, or that of a Metropolitan Bishop, a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop of the Metropolis/Diocese, in which his town or village is.\n\nThis special Patriarchal, Metropolitan or Episcopal permission is essential for the above-mentioned ordinations and consecrations.
