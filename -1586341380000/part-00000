These strings are generally used to set the mood of a [[raga]] at the very beginning of a presentation. The frets, which are known as {{IAST|pard\u0101}} or [[thaat]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Th\u0101\u1e6d (Instrumental) |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopaedia of the Music of India |author=Sa\u1e45g\u012bt Mah\u0101bh\u0101rat\u012b |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195650983.001.0001/acref-9780195650983-e-4974?rskey=LEF1wZ&result=4974 |accessdate=5 September 2018 |language=en |url-access=subscription |isbn=9780199797721 |date=2011}}</ref> are movable, allowing fine-tuning. The played strings run to tuning pegs on or near the head of the instrument, while the sympathetic strings, which are a variety of different lengths, pass through small holes in the fretboard to engage with the smaller tuning pegs that run down the instrument's neck.\n\nThe instrument has two [[bridge (instrument)|bridges]]: the large bridge (''badaa goraa'') for the playing and drone strings and the small bridge (''chota goraa'') for the sympathetic strings. Its timbre results from the way the strings interact with the wide, sloping bridge. As a string reverberates its length changes slightly as its edge touches the bridge, promoting the creation of [[overtones]] and giving the sound its distinctive tone. The maintenance of this specific tone by shaping the bridge is called ''[[jivari|jawari]]''. Many musicians rely on instrument makers to adjust this.\n\nMaterials used in construction include [[teak|teak wood]] or ''tun'' wood (''[[Cedrela toona]]''), which is a variation of mahogany, for the neck and faceplate (''tabli''), and [[Calabash|calabash gourd]]s for the resonating chambers. The instrument's bridges are made of deer horn, ebony, or very occasionally from camel bone. Synthetic material is now common as well.\n\n== Construction styles ==\nThere are two popular modern styles of sitar offered in a variety of sub-styles and decorative patterns. The two popular styles are the full decorated \"instrumental style\" sitars (sometimes called \"Ravi Shankar style sitars\") and the \"gayaki style\" sitars. \n\n[[File:Sitar mogara.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Close-up of the pen work on a \"Ravi Shankar style\" sitar]]\nThe other type of sitar, the instrumental style, is most often made of seasoned [[toon wood]], but sometimes made of (Burma) teak. It is often fitted with a second resonator, a small tumba (pumpkin or pumpkin-like wood replica) on the neck. This style is usually fully decorated, with floral or grape carvings and [[celluloid]] inlays with colored (often brown or red) and black floral or arabesque patterns. It typically has thirteen sympathetic strings. It is said that the best Burma teak sitars are made from [[teak]] that has been seasoned for generations. Therefore, instrument builders look for old Burma [[teak]] that was used in old colonial-style [[villa]]s as whole trunk [[column]]s for their special sitar constructions.\nThe sources of very old [[Wood drying|seasoned wood]] are a highly guarded trade secret and sometimes a mystery.\n\n[[File:Sitar taraf pegs layout.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Preferences of taraf string & peg positioning and their total number]]\nThere are various additional sub-styles and cross mixes of styles in sitars, according to customer preferences. Most importantly, there are some differences in preferences for the positioning of sympathetic (''taraf'') string pegs (see photo).\n\nAmongst all sitar styles, there are student styles, beginner models, semi-pro styles, pro-models, master models, and so on. Prices are often determined by the manufacturer's name and not by looks alone or materials used. Some sitars by certain manufacturers fetch very high collectible prices. Most notable are older [[Rikhi Ram]] (Delhi) and older [[Hiren Roy]] (Kolkata) sitars depending upon which master built the instrument.\n\n==Tuning==\n{{Listen\n| filename = Sitar sample yaman.ogg\n| title = Sample sitar music \n| description = A 1 min 10 second sample of Sitar sound, playing [[Yaman (raga) |Yaman Raga]]\n| format = [[Ogg]]\n| pos = right \n}}\nTuning depends on the sitarist's school or style, tradition and each artist's personal preference. The main playing string is almost invariably tuned a perfect fourth ''above'' the tonic, the second string being tuned to the tonic. The tonic in the Indian solf\u00e8ge system is referred to as ''\u1e63a\u1e0dja'', ''\u1e63a\u1e0daj'', or the shortened form ''sa'', or  ''kha\u1e5baj'', a dialectal variant of ''\u1e63a\u1e0daj'', not as ''v\u0101d'', and the perfect fifth to which one or more of the drones strings are tuned is referred to as ''pa\u00f1cam'', not ''samv\u0101d''.\n\n(the last three in the upper octave). The player should re-tune for each [[raga]]. Strings are tuned by [[tuning peg]]s, and the main playing strings can be fine-tuned by sliding a bead threaded on each string just below the bridge.\n\n[[File:Sitar jawari.jpg|thumb| A black [[ebony]] wood ''Jawari'']]\nIn one or more of the more common tunings (used by Ravi Shankar, among others, called \"Kharaj Pancham\" sitar) the playable strings are strung in this fashion:\n* ''Chikari'' strings: Sa (high), Sa (middle), and Pa.\n* ''Kharaj'' (bass) strings: Sa (low) and Pa (low).\n* ''Jod'' and ''baaj'' strings, Sa and Ma.\n\nThere is a lot of stylistic variance within these tunings and like most Indian stringed instruments, there is no default tuning. Mostly, tunings vary by schools of teaching ([[gharana]]) and the piece that is meant to be played.\n\n==Playing==\nThe instrument is balanced between the player's left foot and right knee. The hands move freely without having to carry any of the instrument's weight.{{Citation needed|date = October 2014|reason = Is this true?

The thumb stays anchored on the top of the fretboard just above the main gourd. Generally, only the index and middle fingers are used for fingering although a few players occasionally use the third. A specialized technique called \"[[meend]]\" involves pulling the main melody string down over the bottom portion of the sitar's curved frets, with which the sitarist can achieve a seven [[semitone]] range of [[microtonal]] notes (however, because of the sitar's movable frets, sometimes a fret may be set to a microtone already, and no bending would be required). Adept players bring in charisma through the use of special techniques like Kan, Krintan, [[Murki]], Zamzama etc. They also use special Mizrab Bol-s, as in Misrabani<ref>Ragini Trivedi, ''Sitar Compositions in Ome Swarlipi'', {{ISBN|978-0-557-70596-2}}, 2010.</ref> and create Chhand-s even in odd-numbered Tal-s like [[Jhoomra]].{{clarify | reason = none of the last two sentences are really comprehensible to non-experts|date=February 2013}}\n\n==World music influence==\n[[File:Dia5275 Ravi Shankar.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ravi Shankar]] in 1988]]\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s [[Ravi Shankar]], along with his tabla player, [[Alla Rakha]], began a further introduction of Indian classical music to Western culture.\n\nThe sitar saw use in Western popular music when, guided by [[David Crosby]]'s championing of Shankar,<ref name=\"Gallo/Billboard\">{{cite magazine| url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1481439/ravi-shankars-impact-on-pop-music-an-appreciation |last=Gallo |first=Phil |title=Ravi Shankar's Impact on Pop Music: An Appreciation |date=12 December 2012 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|billboard.com]]|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref> [[George Harrison]] played it on [[the Beatles]]' songs \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\", \"[[Love You To]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\", recorded between 1965 and 1967.

A specialized technique called \"[[meend]]\" involves pulling the main melody string down over the bottom portion of the sitar's curved frets, with which the sitarist can achieve a seven [[semitone]] range of [[microtonal]] notes (however, because of the sitar's movable frets, sometimes a fret may be set to a microtone already, and no bending would be required).

When vehicles are fully stopped for periods of time, this is  known as a '''traffic jam'''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sWiUjVAGTVgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Journal+article:+%22Traffic+jam%22#v=snippet&q=traffic%20jam&f=false|title=Traffic Flow Dynamics: Data, Models and Simulation|last=Treiber|first=Martin|last2=Kesting|first2=Arne|date=2012-10-11|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-32459-8|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XikpAQAAMAAJ&dq=Journal+article:+%22Traffic+jam%22&q=Traffic+jam%22|title=Traffic Flow Fundamentals|last=May|first=Adolf Darlington|date=1990|publisher=Prentice Hall|language=en}}</ref> or (informally) a '''traffic snarl-up'''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WVssAQAAMAAJ&q=Journal+article:+%22Traffic+snarl-up%22&dq=Journal+article:+%22Traffic+snarl-up%22|title=Hotelier & Caterer: Official Magazine of FEDHASA.|last=|first=|date=July 1993|publisher=Ramsay Son & Parker|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4o23AAAAIAAJ&q=Journal+article:+%22Traffic+snarl-up%22&dq=Journal+article:+%22Traffic+snarl-up%22|title=Eve: The Essence of Africa's New Woman|date=2004|publisher=Oakland Media Services Limited|language=en}}</ref> Traffic congestion can  lead to drivers becoming frustrated and engaging in [[road rage]].\n\nMathematically, congestion is usually looked at as the number of vehicles that pass through a point in a window of time, or a flow. Congestion flow lends itself to principles of fluid dynamics.\n\n==Causes==\n[[File:Traffic jam Marginal Pinheiros 6122 SAO 07 2009.jpg|thumb|Traffic congestion on Marginal Pinheiros, near downtown [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].

There are a number of specific circumstances which cause or aggravate congestion; most of them reduce the capacity of a road at a given point or over a certain length, or increase the number of vehicles required for a given volume of people or goods. About half of U.S. traffic congestion is recurring, and is attributed to sheer weight of traffic; most of the rest is attributed to traffic incidents, road work and weather events.<ref>{{cite web|title=Congestion: A National Issue|date=2008-08-29|url=http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/aboutus/opstory.htm|accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Essien|first=Aniekan|title=The Impact of Rainfall and Temperature on Peak and Off-Peak Urban Traffic|date=2018|work=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=399\u2013407|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319988115|last2=Petrounias|first2=Ilias|last3=Sampaio|first3=Pedro|last4=Sampaio|first4=Sandra|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-98812-2_36|url=https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-impact-of-rainfall-and-temperature-on-peak-and-offpeak-urban-traffic(dc8d3092-8b88-4ef3-97f0-f8583165308c).html}}</ref> In terms of traffic operation, rainfall reduces traffic capacity and operating speeds, thereby resulting in greater congestion and road network productivity loss. \n\nTraffic research still cannot fully predict under which conditions a \"traffic jam\" (as opposed to heavy, but smoothly flowing traffic) may suddenly occur. It has been found that individual incidents (such as accidents or even a single car braking heavily in a previously smooth flow) may cause ripple effects (a [[cascading failure]]) which then spread out and create a sustained traffic jam when, otherwise, normal flow might have continued for some time longer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amasci.com/amateur/traffic/traffic1.html|title=Science Hobbyist: Traffic Waves}}</ref>\n\n===Separation of work and residential areas===\nPeople often work and live in different parts of the city. Places of work are often located away from housing areas, resulting in the need for people to commute to work. \nAccording to a 2011 report published by the [[United States Census Bureau]], a total of 132.3 million people in the United States commute between their work and residential areas daily.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2011/compendia/statab/131ed/transportation.html|title=Transportation Report By USCB}}</ref>\n\n===Movement to obtain or provide goods and services===\nPeople may need to move about within the city to obtain goods and services, for instance to purchase goods or attend classes in a different part of the city.\nBrussels, a city with a strong service economy, has one of the worst traffic congestion in the world, wasting 74 hours in traffic in 2014.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Mathematical theories===\n[[File:Motorcycles in Taipei.JPG|thumb|left|Congestion on a street in [[Taipei]] consisting primarily of [[motorcycles]]]]\nSome traffic engineers have attempted to apply the rules of [[fluid dynamics]] to traffic flow,  likening it to the flow of a fluid in a pipe. Congestion simulations and real-time observations have shown that in heavy but free flowing traffic, jams can arise spontaneously, triggered by minor events (\"[[butterfly effect]]s\"), such as an abrupt steering maneuver by a single motorist. Traffic scientists liken such a situation to the sudden freezing of [[supercooling|supercooled fluid]].<ref name=\"ball\">''Critical Mass'' \u2013 [[Philip Ball|Ball, Philip]], {{ISBN|0-09-945786-5}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike a fluid, traffic flow is often affected by signals or other events at junctions that periodically affect the smooth flow of traffic.  Alternative mathematical theories exist, such as [[Boris Kerner]]'s [[three-phase traffic theory]] (see also spatiotemporal [[Traffic congestion: Reconstruction with Kerner\u2019s three-phase theory|reconstruction of traffic congestion]]).\n\nBecause of the poor correlation of theoretical models to actual observed traffic flows, transportation planners and highway engineers attempt to [[traffic flow|forecast traffic flow]] using empirical models. Their working traffic models typically use a combination of macro-, micro- and mesoscopic features, and may add matrix [[entropy]] effects, by \"platooning\" groups of vehicles and by randomising the flow patterns within individual segments of the network. These models are then typically calibrated by measuring actual traffic flows on the links in the network, and the baseline flows are adjusted accordingly.\n\nA team of MIT mathematicians has developed a model that describes the formation of \"phantom jams,\" in which small disturbances (a driver hitting the brake too hard, or getting too close to another car) in heavy traffic can become amplified into a full-blown, self-sustaining traffic jam. Key to the study is the realization that the mathematics of such jams, which the researchers call \"jamitons,\" are strikingly similar to the equations that describe detonation waves produced by explosions, says Aslan Kasimov, lecturer in MIT's Department of Mathematics. That discovery enabled the team to solve traffic-jam equations that were first theorized in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090608151550.htm|title=Mathematicians Take Aim At 'Phantom' Traffic Jams|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn recent articles, percolation theory has been applied to study traffic congestion in a city. The quality of the global traffic in a city at a given time is by a single parameter, the percolation critical threshold. The critical threshold represent the velocity below which one can travel in a large fraction of city network. The method is able to  identify  repetitive traffic bottlenecks<ref>Percolation transition in dynamical traffic network with evolving critical bottlenecks \nD. Li, B. Fu, Y. Wang, G. Lu, Y.

They found an approximate  universal power law for the jam sizes distribution.\n\n===Economic theories===\n[[File:Trafficjamdelhi.jpg|thumb|left|India's [[economic development in India|economic growth]] has resulted in a massive increase in the number of private vehicles on its roads overwhelming the transport infrastructure. Shown here is a traffic jam in [[Delhi]].]]\n\nCongested roads can be seen as an example of the [[tragedy of the commons]]. Because roads in most places are free at the point of usage, there is little financial incentive for drivers not to over-use them, up to the point where traffic collapses into a jam, when demand becomes limited by [[opportunity cost]]. [[Private highway|Privatization of highways]] and [[road pricing]] have both been proposed as measures that may reduce congestion through economic incentives and disincentives. Congestion can also happen due to non-recurring highway incidents, such as a [[car accident|crash]] or [[road works|roadworks]], which may reduce the road's capacity below normal levels.\n\n[[File:Traffic jam in Haikou, Hainan, China 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Economic history of China (1949\u2013present)|Rapid economic growth]] in China has resulted in a massive increase in the number of private vehicles in its major cities. Shown here is a traffic jam in downtown [[Haikou]], [[Hainan Province]].]]\nEconomist [[Anthony Downs]] argues that [[rush hour]] traffic congestion is inevitable because of the benefits of having a relatively [[Business hours|standard work day]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. In a [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy, goods can be allocated either by pricing (ability to pay) or by queueing (first-come first-served); congestion is an example of the latter. Instead of the traditional solution of making the \"pipe\" large enough to accommodate the total demand for peak-hour vehicle travel (a supply-side solution), either by widening roadways or increasing \"flow pressure\" via [[automated highway system]]s, Downs advocates greater use of [[road pricing]] to reduce congestion (a demand-side solution, effectively rationing demand), in turn plowing the revenues generated therefrom into [[public transportation]] projects.\n\nA 2011 study in ''[[The American Economic Review]]'' indicates that there may be a \"fundamental law of road congestion.\" The researchers, from the  [[University of Toronto]] and the [[London School of Economics]], analyzed data from the U.S. Highway Performance and Monitoring System for 1983, 1993 and 2003, as well as information on population, employment, geography, transit, and political factors. They determined that the number of vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) increases in direct proportion to the available lane-kilometers of roadways. The implication is that building new roads and widening existing ones only results in additional traffic that continues to rise until peak congestion returns to the previous level.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/transportation/fundamental-law-road-congestion-evidence-u-s-cities/|title=Fundamental Law of Road Congestion: Evidence from U.S. Cities|publisher=journalistsresource.org |date=2014-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Duranton | first1 = Gilles | last2 = Turner | first2 = Matthew A. | year = 2011 | title = The Fundamental Law of Road Congestion: Evidence from U.S. Cities | url =http://www.nber.org/papers/w15376.pdf | journal = American Economic Review | volume = 101 | issue = 6| pages = 2616\u201352 | doi = 10.1257/aer.101.6.2616 }}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nQualitative classification of traffic is often done in the form of a six letter A-F [[Level of service (transportation)|level of service]] (LOS) scale defined in the [[Highway Capacity Manual]], a US document used (or used as a basis for national guidelines) worldwide. These levels are used by [[Transport engineering|transportation engineers]] as a [[shorthand]] and to describe traffic levels to the lay public. While this system generally uses delay as the basis for its measurements, the particular measurements and statistical methods vary depending on the facility being described. For instance, while the percent time spent following a slower-moving vehicle figures into the LOS for a rural two-lane road, the LOS at an urban intersection incorporates such measurements as the number of drivers forced to wait through more than one signal cycle.<ref>''Traffic Engineering'', Third Edition.  Roger P. Roess, Elana S. Prassas, and William R. McShane.  {{ISBN|0-13-142471-8}}</ref>\n\nTraffic congestion occurs in time and space, i.e., it is a [[wikt:spatiotemporal|spatiotemporal]] process. Therefore, another classification schema of traffic congestion is associated with some [[Traffic congestion: Reconstruction with Kerner\u2019s three-phase theory|common spatiotemporal features of traffic congestion]] found in measured traffic data. Common spatiotemporal empirical features of traffic congestion are those features, which are qualitatively the same for different [[highway]]s in different countries measured during years of traffic observations. Common features of traffic congestion are independent on [[weather]], road conditions and road infrastructure, vehicular technology, driver characteristics, day time, etc. Examples of common features of traffic congestion are the features [J] and [S] for, respectively, the ''wide moving jam'' and ''synchronized flow'' traffic phases found in Kerner\u2019s [[three-phase traffic theory]]. The common features of traffic congestion can be reconstructed in space and time with the use of the [[Traffic congestion: Reconstruction with Kerner\u2019s three-phase theory|ASDA and FOTO]] models.\n\n==Negative impacts==\n{{Original research|section|date=January 2017}}\n[[File:TrafficJamFrustration.jpg|thumb|A frustrated driver in a traffic jam]]\nTraffic congestion has a number of negative effects:\n* Wasting time of motorists and passengers (\"[[opportunity cost]]\"). As a non-productive activity for most people, congestion reduces regional economic health.\n* Delays, which may result in late arrival for employment, meetings, and education, resulting in lost business, disciplinary action or other personal losses.\n* Inability to forecast travel time accurately, leading to drivers allocating more time to travel \"just in case\", and less time on productive activities.\n* Wasted fuel increasing [[air pollution]] and [[greenhouse gas|carbon dioxide emissions]] owing to increased idling, acceleration and braking.\n* Wear and tear on vehicles as a result of idling in traffic and frequent acceleration and braking, leading to more frequent repairs and replacements.\n* Stressed and frustrated motorists, encouraging [[road rage]] and reduced health of motorists\n* Emergencies: blocked traffic may interfere with the passage of emergency vehicles traveling to their destinations where they are urgently needed.\n* [[Spillover effect]] from congested main arteries to secondary roads and side streets as alternative routes are attempted ('[[rat running]]'), which may affect neighborhood [[amenity]] and [[real estate]] prices.\n* Higher chance of collisions due to tight spacing and constant stopping-and-going.\n\n===Road rage===\n[[Road rage]] is aggressive or angry behavior by a driver of an automobile or other motor vehicle. Such behavior might include rude gestures, verbal insults, deliberately driving in an unsafe or threatening manner, or making threats. Road rage can lead to altercations, assaults, and collisions which result in injuries and even deaths. It can be thought of as an extreme case of [[aggressive driving]].\n\nThe term originated in the United States in 1987\u20131988 (specifically, from Newscasters at [[KTLA]], a local television station), when a rash of freeway shootings occurred on the 405, 110 and 10 freeways in Los Angeles, California. These shooting sprees even spawned a response from the AAA Motor Club to its members on how to respond to drivers with road rage or aggressive maneuvers and gestures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/303700.html|title=\"Road rage\" meaning and origin, Phrases.org.uk|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Economic loss ===\n[[File:Costs of Congestion and Parking Search.png|thumb|300px|Costs of Congestion and Parking Search]]{{Expand section|date=December 2019}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Area\n!Loss in Billion\n!Note\n|-\n|USA\n|$305 <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/gridlock-woes-traffic-congestion-by-the-numbers/519959/|title=Gridlock woes: Traffic congestion by the numbers|work=Smart Cities Dive|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n|<ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/money/4676929/traffic-los-angeles-driving/|title=Here's How Much Sitting In Traffic Is Costing You|website=Money|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|UK\n|$52.01 \n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newburghgazette.com/2018/02/06/congestion-costs-united-kingdom-almost-40bn-a-year-report/|title=Home|website=newburghgazette.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[New York City|NYC]]\n|$33.7\n|\n|-\n|[[Los Angeles|LA]]\n|$19.2\n|<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/530705/heres-how-much-traffic-congestion-costs-worlds-biggest-cities|title=Here's How Much Traffic Congestion Costs the World's Biggest Cities|date=2018-02-11|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Metro Manila|Manila]]\n|$18.615 \n|<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.imoney.ph/articles/the-cost-of-traffic-in-metro-manila/|title=Find Out What's The Cost of Traffic In Metro Manila|last=Isla|first=Rouselle|date=2016-05-26|work=iMoney.ph|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Bangladesh]]\n|$11.4\n|<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/society/traffic-jam-the-ugly-side-dhakas-development-1575355?amp|title=Traffic jam: The ugly side of Dhaka's development|date=2018-05-13|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[San Francisco|SF]]\n|$10.6\n|\n|-\n|Atlanta\n|$7.1 \n|\n|-\n|Jakarta\n|$5\n|<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/10/06/jakarta-foots-us5b-annual-bill-for-traffic-jams-minister.html|title=Jakarta foots US$5b annual bill for traffic jams: Minister|last=Post|first=The Jakarta|work=The Jakarta Post|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}</ref>\n|-\n|Dhaka\n|$4.463\n|<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/colossal-loss-1553002|title=Colossal loss|date=2018-03-25|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area|GTHA]]\n|$3.3\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolinx.com/en/regionalplanning/costsofcongestion/costs_congestion.aspx|title=Costs of Congestion|website=www.metrolinx.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Positive impacts==\n\nCongestion has the benefit of encouraging motorists to retime their trips so that expensive road space is in full use for more hours per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aptnsw.org.au/blunden83.html|title=Congestion - Friend or Foe? - W R Blunden 1983|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe standard response to congestion is to expand road space somehow, perhaps by widening an existing road or else by adding a new road, bridge or tunnel. However, that could well result in increased traffic flow, otherwise known as [[induced demand]], causing congestion to appear somewhere else. Moreover, [[Braess' paradox]] shows that adding road capacity might make congestion worse, even if demand does not increase.\n\nIt has been argued that traffic congestion, by reducing road speeds in cities, could reduce the frequency and severity of road accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipart.nsw.gov.au/files/13687885-53fa-40c8-b33d-a246010695c4/Draft_Report__Maximum_fares_for_metropolitan_and_outer_metropolitan_buses_from_January_2014.pdf |title=Maximum fares for metropolitan and outer metropolitan buses from January 2014 - Draft Report, p. 37, citing work by LECG \"Value of Sydney bus externalities and optimal Government subsidy - Final report\", September 2009, p. 17 |date= |accessdate=2018-07-12}}</ref>\n\n==Countermeasures==\n===Road infrastructure===\n[[File:Grnfld Ramp.jpg|thumb|Metered ramp on [[Interstate 894|I-894]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], U.S. The queue of cars waiting at the red light can be seen on the upper portion of the picture.]]\n[[File:A38(M) Aston Expressway.jpg|thumb|The [[A38(M) motorway|A38M Aston Expressway]] in [[Aston|As]]<nowiki/>ton, towards central [[Birmingham]] - the lanes are controlled via the overhead gantries, which reverse the flow of one lane (making 4 in one direction, 2 in the other and a central buffer lane) during peak times accordingly.]]\n[[File:404HOV lane.png|thumb|upright|The HOV lanes in [[Highway 404]] in [[Southern Ontario]] are separated by a stripped buffer zone that breaks occasionally to allow vehicles to enter and exit the HOV lane.]]\n\n* [[Junction (road)|Junction]] improvements\n** [[Grade separation]], using bridges (or, less often, tunnels) freeing movements from having to stop for other crossing movements\n** [[Ramp meter|Ramp signalling]], 'drip-feeding' merging traffic via [[traffic signal]]s onto a congested motorway-type roadway\n** Reducing junctions\n*** [[Local-express lanes]], providing through lanes that bypass junction on-ramp and off-ramp zones\n*** [[Limited-access road]], roads that limit the type and amounts of [[driveway]]s along their lengths\n* [[Reversible lane]]s, where certain sections of highway operate in the opposite direction on different times of the day(s) of the week, to match asymmetric demand.

When vehicles are fully stopped for periods of time, this is  known as a '''traffic jam'''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sWiUjVAGTVgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Journal+article:+%22Traffic+jam%22#v=snippet&q=traffic%20jam&f=false|title=Traffic Flow Dynamics: Data, Models and Simulation|last=Treiber|first=Martin|last2=Kesting|first2=Arne|date=2012-10-11|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-32459-8|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XikpAQAAMAAJ&dq=Journal+article:+%22Traffic+jam%22&q=Traffic+jam%22|title=Traffic Flow Fundamentals|last=May|first=Adolf Darlington|date=1990|publisher=Prentice Hall|language=en}}</ref> or (informally) a '''traffic snarl-up'''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WVssAQAAMAAJ&q=Journal+article:+%22Traffic+snarl-up%22&dq=Journal+article:+%22Traffic+snarl-up%22|title=Hotelier & Caterer: Official Magazine of FEDHASA.|last=|first=|date=July 1993|publisher=Ramsay Son & Parker|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4o23AAAAIAAJ&q=Journal+article:+%22Traffic+snarl-up%22&dq=Journal+article:+%22Traffic+snarl-up%22|title=Eve: The Essence of Africa's New Woman|date=2004|publisher=Oakland Media Services Limited|language=en}}</ref> Traffic congestion can  lead to drivers becoming frustrated and engaging in [[road rage]].\n\nMathematically, congestion is usually looked at as the number of vehicles that pass through a point in a window of time, or a flow. Congestion flow lends itself to principles of fluid dynamics.\n\n==Causes==\n[[File:Traffic jam Marginal Pinheiros 6122 SAO 07 2009.jpg|thumb|Traffic congestion on Marginal Pinheiros, near downtown [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].

There are a number of specific circumstances which cause or aggravate congestion; most of them reduce the capacity of a road at a given point or over a certain length, or increase the number of vehicles required for a given volume of people or goods. About half of U.S. traffic congestion is recurring, and is attributed to sheer weight of traffic; most of the rest is attributed to traffic incidents, road work and weather events.<ref>{{cite web|title=Congestion: A National Issue|date=2008-08-29|url=http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/aboutus/opstory.htm|accessdate=2008-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Essien|first=Aniekan|title=The Impact of Rainfall and Temperature on Peak and Off-Peak Urban Traffic|date=2018|work=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=399\u2013407|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319988115|last2=Petrounias|first2=Ilias|last3=Sampaio|first3=Pedro|last4=Sampaio|first4=Sandra|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-98812-2_36|url=https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-impact-of-rainfall-and-temperature-on-peak-and-offpeak-urban-traffic(dc8d3092-8b88-4ef3-97f0-f8583165308c).html}}</ref> In terms of traffic operation, rainfall reduces traffic capacity and operating speeds, thereby resulting in greater congestion and road network productivity loss. \n\nTraffic research still cannot fully predict under which conditions a \"traffic jam\" (as opposed to heavy, but smoothly flowing traffic) may suddenly occur. It has been found that individual incidents (such as accidents or even a single car braking heavily in a previously smooth flow) may cause ripple effects (a [[cascading failure]]) which then spread out and create a sustained traffic jam when, otherwise, normal flow might have continued for some time longer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amasci.com/amateur/traffic/traffic1.html|title=Science Hobbyist: Traffic Waves}}</ref>\n\n===Separation of work and residential areas===\nPeople often work and live in different parts of the city. Places of work are often located away from housing areas, resulting in the need for people to commute to work. \nAccording to a 2011 report published by the [[United States Census Bureau]], a total of 132.3 million people in the United States commute between their work and residential areas daily.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2011/compendia/statab/131ed/transportation.html|title=Transportation Report By USCB}}</ref>\n\n===Movement to obtain or provide goods and services===\nPeople may need to move about within the city to obtain goods and services, for instance to purchase goods or attend classes in a different part of the city.\nBrussels, a city with a strong service economy, has one of the worst traffic congestion in the world, wasting 74 hours in traffic in 2014.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Mathematical theories===\n[[File:Motorcycles in Taipei.JPG|thumb|left|Congestion on a street in [[Taipei]] consisting primarily of [[motorcycles]]]]\nSome traffic engineers have attempted to apply the rules of [[fluid dynamics]] to traffic flow,  likening it to the flow of a fluid in a pipe. Congestion simulations and real-time observations have shown that in heavy but free flowing traffic, jams can arise spontaneously, triggered by minor events (\"[[butterfly effect]]s\"), such as an abrupt steering maneuver by a single motorist. Traffic scientists liken such a situation to the sudden freezing of [[supercooling|supercooled fluid]].<ref name=\"ball\">''Critical Mass'' \u2013 [[Philip Ball|Ball, Philip]], {{ISBN|0-09-945786-5}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike a fluid, traffic flow is often affected by signals or other events at junctions that periodically affect the smooth flow of traffic.  Alternative mathematical theories exist, such as [[Boris Kerner]]'s [[three-phase traffic theory]] (see also spatiotemporal [[Traffic congestion: Reconstruction with Kerner\u2019s three-phase theory|reconstruction of traffic congestion]]).\n\nBecause of the poor correlation of theoretical models to actual observed traffic flows, transportation planners and highway engineers attempt to [[traffic flow|forecast traffic flow]] using empirical models. Their working traffic models typically use a combination of macro-, micro- and mesoscopic features, and may add matrix [[entropy]] effects, by \"platooning\" groups of vehicles and by randomising the flow patterns within individual segments of the network. These models are then typically calibrated by measuring actual traffic flows on the links in the network, and the baseline flows are adjusted accordingly.\n\nA team of MIT mathematicians has developed a model that describes the formation of \"phantom jams,\" in which small disturbances (a driver hitting the brake too hard, or getting too close to another car) in heavy traffic can become amplified into a full-blown, self-sustaining traffic jam. Key to the study is the realization that the mathematics of such jams, which the researchers call \"jamitons,\" are strikingly similar to the equations that describe detonation waves produced by explosions, says Aslan Kasimov, lecturer in MIT's Department of Mathematics. That discovery enabled the team to solve traffic-jam equations that were first theorized in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090608151550.htm|title=Mathematicians Take Aim At 'Phantom' Traffic Jams|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn recent articles, percolation theory has been applied to study traffic congestion in a city. The quality of the global traffic in a city at a given time is by a single parameter, the percolation critical threshold. The critical threshold represent the velocity below which one can travel in a large fraction of city network. The method is able to  identify  repetitive traffic bottlenecks<ref>Percolation transition in dynamical traffic network with evolving critical bottlenecks \nD. Li, B. Fu, Y. Wang, G. Lu, Y.

They found an approximate  universal power law for the jam sizes distribution.\n\n===Economic theories===\n[[File:Trafficjamdelhi.jpg|thumb|left|India's [[economic development in India|economic growth]] has resulted in a massive increase in the number of private vehicles on its roads overwhelming the transport infrastructure. Shown here is a traffic jam in [[Delhi]].]]\n\nCongested roads can be seen as an example of the [[tragedy of the commons]]. Because roads in most places are free at the point of usage, there is little financial incentive for drivers not to over-use them, up to the point where traffic collapses into a jam, when demand becomes limited by [[opportunity cost]]. [[Private highway|Privatization of highways]] and [[road pricing]] have both been proposed as measures that may reduce congestion through economic incentives and disincentives. Congestion can also happen due to non-recurring highway incidents, such as a [[car accident|crash]] or [[road works|roadworks]], which may reduce the road's capacity below normal levels.\n\n[[File:Traffic jam in Haikou, Hainan, China 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Economic history of China (1949\u2013present)|Rapid economic growth]] in China has resulted in a massive increase in the number of private vehicles in its major cities. Shown here is a traffic jam downtown [[Haikou City]], [[Hainan Province]].]]\nEconomist [[Anthony Downs]] argues that [[rush hour]] traffic congestion is inevitable because of the benefits of having a relatively [[Business hours|standard work day]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. In a [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy, goods can be allocated either by pricing (ability to pay) or by queueing (first-come first-served); congestion is an example of the latter. Instead of the traditional solution of making the \"pipe\" large enough to accommodate the total demand for peak-hour vehicle travel (a supply-side solution), either by widening roadways or increasing \"flow pressure\" via [[automated highway system]]s, Downs advocates greater use of [[road pricing]] to reduce congestion (a demand-side solution, effectively rationing demand), in turn plowing the revenues generated therefrom into [[public transportation]] projects.\n\nA 2011 study in ''[[The American Economic Review]]'' indicates that there may be a \"fundamental law of road congestion.\" The researchers, from the  [[University of Toronto]] and the [[London School of Economics]], analyzed data from the U.S. Highway Performance and Monitoring System for 1983, 1993 and 2003, as well as information on population, employment, geography, transit, and political factors. They determined that the number of vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) increases in direct proportion to the available lane-kilometers of roadways. The implication is that building new roads and widening existing ones only results in additional traffic that continues to rise until peak congestion returns to the previous level.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/transportation/fundamental-law-road-congestion-evidence-u-s-cities/|title=Fundamental Law of Road Congestion: Evidence from U.S. Cities|publisher=journalistsresource.org |date=2014-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Duranton | first1 = Gilles | last2 = Turner | first2 = Matthew A. | year = 2011 | title = The Fundamental Law of Road Congestion: Evidence from U.S. Cities | url =http://www.nber.org/papers/w15376.pdf | journal = American Economic Review | volume = 101 | issue = 6| pages = 2616\u201352 | doi = 10.1257/aer.101.6.2616 }}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nQualitative classification of traffic is often done in the form of a six letter A-F [[Level of service (transportation)|level of service]] (LOS) scale defined in the [[Highway Capacity Manual]], a US document used (or used as a basis for national guidelines) worldwide. These levels are used by [[Transport engineering|transportation engineers]] as a [[shorthand]] and to describe traffic levels to the lay public. While this system generally uses delay as the basis for its measurements, the particular measurements and statistical methods vary depending on the facility being described. For instance, while the percent time spent following a slower-moving vehicle figures into the LOS for a rural two-lane road, the LOS at an urban intersection incorporates such measurements as the number of drivers forced to wait through more than one signal cycle.<ref>''Traffic Engineering'', Third Edition.  Roger P. Roess, Elana S. Prassas, and William R. McShane.  {{ISBN|0-13-142471-8}}</ref>\n\nTraffic congestion occurs in time and space, i.e., it is a [[wikt:spatiotemporal|spatiotemporal]] process. Therefore, another classification schema of traffic congestion is associated with some [[Traffic congestion: Reconstruction with Kerner\u2019s three-phase theory|common spatiotemporal features of traffic congestion]] found in measured traffic data. Common spatiotemporal empirical features of traffic congestion are those features, which are qualitatively the same for different [[highway]]s in different countries measured during years of traffic observations. Common features of traffic congestion are independent on [[weather]], road conditions and road infrastructure, vehicular technology, driver characteristics, day time, etc. Examples of common features of traffic congestion are the features [J] and [S] for, respectively, the ''wide moving jam'' and ''synchronized flow'' traffic phases found in Kerner\u2019s [[three-phase traffic theory]]. The common features of traffic congestion can be reconstructed in space and time with the use of the [[Traffic congestion: Reconstruction with Kerner\u2019s three-phase theory|ASDA and FOTO]] models.\n\n==Negative impacts==\n{{Original research|section|date=January 2017}}\n[[File:TrafficJamFrustration.jpg|thumb|A frustrated driver in a traffic jam]]\nTraffic congestion has a number of negative effects:\n* Wasting time of motorists and passengers (\"[[opportunity cost]]\"). As a non-productive activity for most people, congestion reduces regional economic health.\n* Delays, which may result in late arrival for employment, meetings, and education, resulting in lost business, disciplinary action or other personal losses.\n* Inability to forecast travel time accurately, leading to drivers allocating more time to travel \"just in case\", and less time on productive activities.\n* Wasted fuel increasing [[air pollution]] and [[greenhouse gas|carbon dioxide emissions]] owing to increased idling, acceleration and braking.\n* Wear and tear on vehicles as a result of idling in traffic and frequent acceleration and braking, leading to more frequent repairs and replacements.\n* Stressed and frustrated motorists, encouraging [[road rage]] and reduced health of motorists\n* Emergencies: blocked traffic may interfere with the passage of emergency vehicles traveling to their destinations where they are urgently needed.\n* [[Spillover effect]] from congested main arteries to secondary roads and side streets as alternative routes are attempted ('[[rat running]]'), which may affect neighborhood [[amenity]] and [[real estate]] prices.\n* Higher chance of collisions due to tight spacing and constant stopping-and-going.\n\n===Road rage===\n[[Road rage]] is aggressive or angry behavior by a driver of an automobile or other motor vehicle. Such behavior might include rude gestures, verbal insults, deliberately driving in an unsafe or threatening manner, or making threats. Road rage can lead to altercations, assaults, and collisions which result in injuries and even deaths. It can be thought of as an extreme case of [[aggressive driving]].\n\nThe term originated in the United States in 1987\u20131988 (specifically, from Newscasters at [[KTLA]], a local television station), when a rash of freeway shootings occurred on the 405, 110 and 10 freeways in Los Angeles, California. These shooting sprees even spawned a response from the AAA Motor Club to its members on how to respond to drivers with road rage or aggressive maneuvers and gestures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/303700.html|title=\"Road rage\" meaning and origin, Phrases.org.uk|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Economic loss ===\n[[File:Costs of Congestion and Parking Search.png|thumb|300px|Costs of Congestion and Parking Search]]{{Expand section|date=December 2019}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Area\n!Loss in Billion\n!Note\n|-\n|USA\n|$305 <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/gridlock-woes-traffic-congestion-by-the-numbers/519959/|title=Gridlock woes: Traffic congestion by the numbers|work=Smart Cities Dive|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n|<ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/money/4676929/traffic-los-angeles-driving/|title=Here's How Much Sitting In Traffic Is Costing You|website=Money|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|UK\n|$52.01 \n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newburghgazette.com/2018/02/06/congestion-costs-united-kingdom-almost-40bn-a-year-report/|title=Home|website=newburghgazette.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[New York City|NYC]]\n|$33.7\n|\n|-\n|[[Los Angeles|LA]]\n|$19.2\n|<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/530705/heres-how-much-traffic-congestion-costs-worlds-biggest-cities|title=Here's How Much Traffic Congestion Costs the World's Biggest Cities|date=2018-02-11|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Metro Manila|Manila]]\n|$18.615 \n|<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.imoney.ph/articles/the-cost-of-traffic-in-metro-manila/|title=Find Out What's The Cost of Traffic In Metro Manila|last=Isla|first=Rouselle|date=2016-05-26|work=iMoney.ph|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Bangladesh]]\n|$11.4\n|<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/society/traffic-jam-the-ugly-side-dhakas-development-1575355?amp|title=Traffic jam: The ugly side of Dhaka's development|date=2018-05-13|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[San Francisco|SF]]\n|$10.6\n|\n|-\n|Atlanta\n|$7.1 \n|\n|-\n|Jakarta\n|$5\n|<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/10/06/jakarta-foots-us5b-annual-bill-for-traffic-jams-minister.html|title=Jakarta foots US$5b annual bill for traffic jams: Minister|last=Post|first=The Jakarta|work=The Jakarta Post|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}</ref>\n|-\n|Dhaka\n|$4.463\n|<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/colossal-loss-1553002|title=Colossal loss|date=2018-03-25|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area|GTHA]]\n|$3.3\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolinx.com/en/regionalplanning/costsofcongestion/costs_congestion.aspx|title=Costs of Congestion|website=www.metrolinx.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Positive impacts==\n\nCongestion has the benefit of encouraging motorists to retime their trips so that expensive road space is in full use for more hours per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aptnsw.org.au/blunden83.html|title=Congestion - Friend or Foe? - W R Blunden 1983|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe standard response to congestion is to expand road space somehow, perhaps by widening an existing road or else by adding a new road, bridge or tunnel. However, that could well result in increased traffic flow, otherwise known as [[induced demand]], causing congestion to appear somewhere else. Moreover, [[Braess' paradox]] shows that adding road capacity might make congestion worse, even if demand does not increase.\n\nIt has been argued that traffic congestion, by reducing road speeds in cities, could reduce the frequency and severity of road accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipart.nsw.gov.au/files/13687885-53fa-40c8-b33d-a246010695c4/Draft_Report__Maximum_fares_for_metropolitan_and_outer_metropolitan_buses_from_January_2014.pdf |title=Maximum fares for metropolitan and outer metropolitan buses from January 2014 - Draft Report, p. 37, citing work by LECG \"Value of Sydney bus externalities and optimal Government subsidy - Final report\", September 2009, p. 17 |date= |accessdate=2018-07-12}}</ref>\n\n==Countermeasures==\n===Road infrastructure===\n[[File:Grnfld Ramp.jpg|thumb|Metered ramp on [[Interstate 894|I-894]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], U.S. The queue of cars waiting at the red light can be seen on the upper portion of the picture.]]\n[[File:A38(M) Aston Expressway.jpg|thumb|The [[A38(M) motorway|A38M Aston Expressway]] in [[Aston|As]]<nowiki/>ton, towards central [[Birmingham]] - the lanes are controlled via the overhead gantries, which reverse the flow of one lane (making 4 in one direction, 2 in the other and a central buffer lane) during peak times accordingly.]]\n[[File:404HOV lane.png|thumb|upright|The HOV lanes in [[Highway 404]] in [[Southern Ontario]] are separated by a stripped buffer zone that breaks occasionally to allow vehicles to enter and exit the HOV lane.]]\n\n* [[Junction (road)|Junction]] improvements\n** [[Grade separation]], using bridges (or, less often, tunnels) freeing movements from having to stop for other crossing movements\n** [[Ramp meter|Ramp signalling]], 'drip-feeding' merging traffic via [[traffic signal]]s onto a congested motorway-type roadway\n** Reducing junctions\n*** [[Local-express lanes]], providing through lanes that bypass junction on-ramp and off-ramp zones\n*** [[Limited-access road]], roads that limit the type and amounts of [[driveway]]s along their lengths\n* [[Reversible lane]]s, where certain sections of highway operate in the opposite direction on different times of the day(s) of the week, to match asymmetric demand.

He warned that roads were in serious danger of becoming so congested that the economy would suffer.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title = Delivering choice and reliability\n| url = http://www.dft.gov.uk/press/speechesstatements/speeches/congestion\n| publisher = Department for Transport\n| url-status = dead\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081122094312/http://www.dft.gov.uk/press/speechesstatements/speeches/congestion\n| archivedate = 2008-11-22\n}}</ref> At the launch of the report Eddington told journalists and transport industry representatives introducing [[road pricing]] to encourage drivers to drive less was an \"economic no-brainer\".

In 2013, ten years later, [[Transport for London]] reported that the scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London. Despite these gains, traffic speeds in central London became progressively slower.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Trafficjamoninterstate5atpyramidlake.jpg|thumb|On Fridays in [[California]], [[Interstate 5]] is often congested as Los Angeles residents travel north for the [[Workweek|weekend]].]]\n[[File:Miami traffic jam, I-95 North rush hour.jpg|thumb|Rush hour traffic in Interstate 95 in [[Miami]]]]\nThe [[Texas Transportation Institute]] estimated that, in 2000, the 75 largest metropolitan areas experienced 3.6 billion vehicle-hours of delay, resulting in 5.7 billion U.S. gallons (21.6 billion liters) in wasted fuel and $67.5 billion in lost productivity, or about 0.7% of the nation's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].

The resulting dried \"threads\"{{refn|Another term that denotes the stigmas.|group=N}} are distinguished by their bitter taste, hay-like fragrance, and slight metallic notes. The saffron crocus is unknown in the wild; its most likely precursor, ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'', originated in Crete or Central Asia;{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} The saffron crocus is native to Southwest Asia and was first cultivated in what is now Greece.{{Sfn|Grigg|1974|p=287}}{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=272}}{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}}\n\nFrom ancient to modern times the [[history of saffron]] is full of applications in food, drink, and traditional herbal medicine: from Africa and Asia to Europe and the Americas the brilliant red threads were&mdash;and are&mdash;prized in baking, curries, and liquor. It coloured textiles and other items and often helped confer the social standing of political elites and religious adepts. Ancient and medieval peoples believed saffron could be used to treat a wide range of ailments, from stomach upsets to the plague.\n\n<blockquote>\"Saffron, for example, was once less regarded than it is today because the crocus from which it is extracted was not particularly mysterious. It flourished in European locations extending from Asia Minor, where it originated, to Saffron Walden in England, where it was naturalised. Only subsequently, when its labour-intensive cultivation became largely centred in Kashmir, did it seem sufficiently exotic to qualify as one of the most precious of spices.\"<ref>Keay (2005), pp. 19-20.</ref></blockquote>Saffron crocus cultivation has long centered on a broad belt of Eurasia bounded by the Mediterranean Sea in the southwest to India and China in the northeast. The major producers of antiquity&mdash;Iran, Spain, India, and Greece&mdash;continue to dominate the world trade.\n\nThe cultivation of saffron in the Americas was begun by members of the [[Schwenkfelder Church]] in Pennsylvania. In recent decades cultivation has spread to New Zealand, Tasmania, and California. Iran has accounted for around 90&ndash;93 percent of recent annual world production and thereby dominates the export market on a by-quantity basis.{{Sfn|Ghorbani|2008|p=1}} Indian kashmiri saffron is considered the finest and most expensive of all saffron.\n\n==Modern trade==\n[[File:Saffron crocus sativus production.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|\n{|\n|-\n| Producing regions: || {{Legend|#800000|major}} || {{Legend|#FF5555|minor}}\n|-\n| Producing nations: || {{Legend|#FF0000|major}} || {{Legend|#FFAEAE|minor}}\n|-\n| Trading centres: || {{Legend|#97CBFF|present}} || {{Legend|#6600CC|past}}\n|}\n]]\n\n===Producers===\n\nAlmost all saffron grows in a belt bounded by the Mediterranean in the west and mountainous Kashmir in the east. All other continents except Antarctica produce smaller amounts. In 1991, Some {{Convert|300|t|kg|0|abbr=on}} of whole threads and powder are gleaned yearly,{{Sfn|Katzer|2010}} of which {{Convert|50|t|kg|0|abbr=on}} is top-grade \"coupe\" saffron.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=2}} Iran is by far the world's most important producer: in 2005 it grossed some {{Convert|230|t|kg}} of dry threads, or 93.7 percent of the year's global total mass; much of the Iranian crop was bound for export.{{Sfn|Ghorbani|2008|p=1}} In the same year, second-ranked Greece produced {{Convert|5.7|t|kg|1|abbr=on}}. Morocco and India's (most of the region's saffron is grown in the more climatically suitable \"Valley of Kashmir\",  which is in Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir) region of Kashmir, tied as the next-highest producer, each produced {{Convert|2.3|t|kg|1|abbr=on}}. Kashmiri saffron is considered the finest and most expensive of all kind of saffron.{{Sfn|Ghorbani|2008|p=1}} In decreasing order, Iran, Greece, Morocco and Kashmir valley (Jammu and Kashmir-India), Azerbaijan, Spain, and Italy dominate the world harvest.\n\nIn Iran, the world's leading producer, the erstwhile and northeasterly [[Khorasan Province]], which in 2004 was divided in three, grows 95 percent of Iranian saffron: the hinterlands of [[Birjand]], [[Ghayen]], [[Ferdows]] in [[South Khorasan Province]], along with areas abutting [[Gonabad]] and [[Torbat-e Heydarieh]] in [[Razavi Khorasan Province]], are its key cropping areas.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=24}} Afghanistan has resumed cultivation in recent years. Despite numerous cultivation efforts in such countries as Austria, England, Germany, and Switzerland, only select locales continue the harvest in northern and central Europe. Among these is the small Swiss village of Mund, in the Valais canton, whose annual saffron output amounts to several kilograms.{{Sfn|Katzer|2010}} Microscale cultivation occurs in Tasmania,{{Sfn|Courtney|2002}} China, Egypt, France, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Turkey (especially [[Safranbolu]]), California, and Central Africa.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=272}}{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}}\n\n{{Multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|width=150|image1=Crocus sativus sahuran.jpg|image2=Crocus sativus1.jpg|caption2=<center>''C. sativus.''</center>}}\n\n===Price===\n====Factors determining costs====\nThe high cost of saffron is due to the difficulty of manually extracting large numbers of minute stigmas, which are the only part of the crocus with the desired aroma and flavour. An exorbitant number of flowers need to be processed in order to yield marketable amounts of saffron. Obtaining {{Convert|1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of dry saffron requires the harvesting of some 50,000 flowers, the equivalent of an association football pitch's area of cultivation, or roughly {{Convert|7140|m2|ha|3|abbr=on}}.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=273}} By another estimate some 75,000 flowers are needed to produce one pound of dry saffron.{{Sfn|Rau|1969|p=35}} This too depends on the typical stigma size of each saffron cultivar. Another complication arises in the flowers' simultaneous and transient blooming. Since so many crocus flowers are needed to yield even derisory quantities of dry saffron, the harvest can be a frenetic affair entailing about forty hours of intense labour. In Kashmir, the thousands of growers must work continuously in relays over the span of one or two weeks throughout both day and night.{{Sfn|Lak|1998}}\n\nOnce extracted, the stigmas must be dried quickly, lest decomposition or mould ruin the batch's marketability. The traditional method of drying involves spreading the fresh stigmas over screens of fine mesh, which are then baked over hot coals or wood or in oven-heated rooms where temperatures reach {{Convert|30|&ndash;|35|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} for 10&ndash;12&nbsp;hours. Afterwards the dried spice is preferably sealed in airtight glass containers.{{refn|Pure saffron stigmas will often be mixed with stamens to add \"dead\"&mdash;read: \"worthless\"&mdash;weight. To put it mildly, stamens have little culinary appeal but will still add the signature yellow color of saffron. Powdered saffron should be red-orange rather than yellowish in colour.|group=N}}{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=8}}\n\n====Actual prices====\nBulk quantities of lower-grade saffron can reach upwards of {{USD}}500 per pound; retail costs for small amounts may exceed ten times that rate. In Western countries the average retail price is approximately US$1,000 per pound.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=272}} Indian Kashmiri saffron is considered best quality and most expensive saffron and has a high demand in world's spice market. Prices vary widely elsewhere, but on average tend to be lower. The high price is somewhat offset by the small quantities needed in kitchens: a few grams at most in medicinal use and a few strands, at most, in culinary applications; there are between 70,000 and 200,000 strands in a pound.\n\nA price set during 2014 for Saffron grown within England was \u00a315 for 0.2. grams, this being sold at [[Fortnum & Mason]], and a gram priced at a value with a maximum of \u00a375.<ref>L.

They may look for threads exhibiting a vivid crimson colouring, slight moistness, and elasticity. They reject threads displaying the telltale dull brick-red colouring&mdash;indicative of old stock&mdash;and broken-off debris collected at the container's bottom, indicative of age-related brittle dryness. Such aged samples are most likely encountered around the main June harvest season, when retailers attempt to clear out the previous season's old inventory and make room for the new season's crop. Buyers recommend that only the current season's threads be used. Reputable saffron wholesalers and retailers will indicate the year of harvest or the two years that bracket the harvest date; a late 2002 harvest would thus be shown as \"2002/2003\".{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=274}}\n\n==Culinary use==\n[[File:01_Paella_Valenciana_original.jpg|thumb|Saffron is one of three key ingredients in ''[[paella|paella valenciana]]'']]\nSaffron features in European, North African, and Asian cuisines. Its aroma is described by taste experts as resembling that of honey, with woody, hay-like, and earthy notes; according to another such assessment, it tastes of hay, but only with bitter hints. Because it imparts a luminous yellow-orange hue, it is used worldwide in everything from cheeses, confectioneries, and liquors to baked goods, curries, meat dishes, and soups. In past eras, many dishes called for prohibitively copious amounts&mdash;hardly for taste, but to parade their wealth.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=275}}\n\nIn Kashmir, saffron is used in ''kehva'', an aromatic beverage made from saffron, almonds, wallnuts, cardamom etc. It is also used in Kashmiri marriage and occasional cuisine namely ''Wazwan'', where chicken is cooked in its heated aromatic solution, and the dish is known as ''konge kokur'' in local language.\n\nBecause of its high cost saffron was often replaced by or diluted with [[safflower]] (''Carthamus tinctorius'') or [[turmeric]] (''Curcuma longa'') in cuisine. Both mimic saffron's colour well, but have distinctive flavours. Saffron is used in the confectionery and liquor industries; this is its most common use in Italy.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=59}} [[Chartreuse (liqueur)|Chartreuse]], [[izarra (liqueur)|izarra]], and [[strega (liqueur)|strega]] are types of alcoholic beverages that rely on saffron to provide a flourish of colour and flavour. Saffron threads are often crumbled and pre-soaked in water or sherry for several minutes prior to adding them to a dish. This process [[solvent extraction|extract]]s the threads' colour and flavour into the liquid phase; powdered saffron does not require this step.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=203}} The soaking solution is then added to the hot cooking dish, allowing even colour and flavour distribution, which is critical in preparing baked goods or thick sauces.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=275}}\n\n{{Cookbook|Saffron}}\n\nThreads are a popular condiment for rice in Spain and Iran, India and Pakistan, and other countries. Two examples of such [[saffron rice]] is the ''zarzuela'' fish-seafood stew and ''[[paella|paella valenciana]]'', a piquant rice-meat preparation. It is essential in making the French ''[[bouillabaisse]]'', which is a spicy fish stew from Marseilles, and the Italian ''[[risotto]] alla milanese''.\n\n[[File:Saffron bun 20051213 001.jpg|thumb|A Swedish-style saffron bun, traditionally consumed before Christmas]]\nThe [[saffron bun]] has Swedish and Cornish variants and in Swedish is known as ''lussekatt'' (literally \"Lucy cat\", after [[Saint Lucy]]) or ''lussebulle''. The latter is a rich yeast dough bun that is enhanced with saffron, along with [[cinnamon]] or [[nutmeg]] and [[Ribes|currant]]s. They are typically eaten during Advent, and especially on [[Saint Lucy's Day]]. In England, the saffron \"revel buns\" were traditionally baked for anniversary feasts (revels) or for church dedications. In the West of Cornwall, large saffron \"tea treat buns\" signify Methodist Sunday School outings and activities.\n\nIn traditional dishes of [[La Mancha]], Spain, the spice is almost ubiquitous.<ref name=\"J.

It is a key recipe in the ''[[chermoula]]'' herb mixture that flavors many Moroccan dishes. Due to its high price, it is mostly used while cooking for special occasions as well as in some Moroccan high-end recipes like the [[pastilla]]. Other Moroccan dishes cooked with saffron include some types of ''[[tajine|tajines]]'', ''kefta'' (meatballs with tomato), ''mqualli'' (a [[citron]]-chicken dish), and ''mrouzia'' (succulent lamb dressed with plums and almonds).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://moroccanzest.com/moroccan-spices/|title=Essential Moroccan Spices for Moroccan Cooking - Moroccan Zest|date=2018-11-11|work=Moroccan Zest|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nUzbeks use it in a special rice-based offering known as \"wedding ''[[plov]]''\" (cf. [[pilaf]]). Saffron is also essential in ''[[chelow kabab]]'', the Iranian national dish. The use of saffron in south Indian cuisine is perhaps best characterised by the eponymous [[Kesari bhath]]<ref>Kesari is the Kannada word for Saffron</ref> - a semolina based dessert from Karnataka. South Asian cuisines also use saffron in ''[[biryani]]s'', which are spicy rice-vegetable dishes. (An example is the ''Pakki'' variety of ''[[Hyderabadi Biryani|Hyderabadi biryani]]''.) Saffron spices subcontinental beef and chicken entrees and goes into many sweets, particularly in Muslim and Rajasthani fare. Modern technology has added another delicacy to the list: saffron ice cream. Regional milk-based sweets feature it,{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}} among them ''[[gulab jamun]]'', ''[[kulfi]]'', ''[[Double Ka Meetha|double ka meetha]]'', and \"saffron ''[[lassi]]''\"; the last is a sweet yogurt-based Jodhpuri drink that is culturally symbolic.\n\n<br />\n\n=== Use Saffron in food ===\nShole Zard: This food is similar to [[Aush]], [[Sholezard]] (Persian: \u0634\u0644\u0647\u200c\u0632\u0631\u062f /\u0283\u028all\u0259 z\u00e6rd/) is an Iranian traditional saffron rice pudding dessert.\n\nThahChin: ([[Tahchin]] Persian: \u062a\u0647 \u0686\u06cc\u0646), also spelled as tah chin or tah-chin, is an Iranian rice cake primarily consisting of rice, yogurt, saffron, and eggs.\n\nISaffron Icecream: Other name ([[Bastani sonnati]]), Very tasty ice cream with Cream or iranain pistachio.\n\nJojeh Kebab: Or ([[Jujeh kabab]]) Roast chicken in a mixture saffron.

It is in the long run an ''unstable'' colouring agent; the imparted vibrant orange-yellow hue quickly fades to a pale and creamy yellow.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=205}} Even in minute amounts, the saffron stamens yield a luminous yellow-orange; increasing the applied saffron concentration will give fabric of increasingly rich shades of red. Clothing dyed with saffron was traditionally reserved for the noble classes, implying that saffron played a ritualised and status-keying role. It was originally responsible for the vermilion-, ochre-, and saffron-hued robes and mantles worn by Buddhist and Hindu monks. In medieval Ireland and Scotland, well-to-do monks wore a long linen undershirt known as a ''l\u00e9ine'', which was traditionally dyed with saffron.{{Sfn|Major|1892|p=49}} In histology the [[hematoxylin]]-[[phloxine]]-saffron [[HPS stain|(HPS) stain]] and [[Movat's pentachrome]] stain are used as a tissue stain to make biological structures more visible under a microscope.<ref name=\"Sigdel\">{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Sigdel | first1 = S. \n| last2 = Gemind | first2 = J.

Saffron's usual substitutes in food&mdash;turmeric and safflower, among others&mdash;yield a garishly bright yellow that could hardly be confused with that of saffron. Saffron's main colourant is the [[carotenoid]] [[crocin]]; it has been discovered in the less tediously harvested&mdash;and hence less costly&mdash;[[gardenia]] fruit. Research in China is ongoing.{{Sfn|Dharmananda|2005}} \n\n==Perfumery==\nIn Europe saffron threads were a key component of an aromatic oil known as ''crocinum'', which comprised such motley ingredients as [[Anchusa officinalis|alkanet]], [[dragon's blood]] (for colour), and wine (again for colour). ''Crocinum'' was applied as a perfume to hair. Another preparation involved mixing saffron with wine to produce a viscous yellow spray; it was copiously applied in sudoriferously sunny Roman amphitheatres&mdash;as an air freshener.{{Sfn|Dalby|2002|p=138}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of saffron]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=N}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n'''Books'''\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=33em}}\n* {{Citation|last=Dalby |first=A.|author-link=Andrew Dalby|year=2002|title=Dangerous Tastes: The Story of Spices|edition=1st|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23674-5<!--0520236742-->|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7IHcZ21dyjwC}}\n* {{Citation|last=Grigg |first=D.

The resulting dried \"threads\"{{refn|Another term that denotes the stigmas.|group=N}} are distinguished by their bitter taste, hay-like fragrance, and slight metallic notes. The saffron crocus is unknown in the wild; its most likely precursor, ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'', originated in Crete or Central Asia;{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} The saffron crocus is native to Southwest Asia and was first cultivated in what is now Greece.{{Sfn|Grigg|1974|p=287}}{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=272}}{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}}\n\nFrom ancient to modern times the [[history of saffron]] is full of applications in food, drink, and traditional herbal medicine: from Africa and Asia to Europe and the Americas the brilliant red threads were&mdash;and are&mdash;prized in baking, curries, and liquor. It coloured textiles and other items and often helped confer the social standing of political elites and religious adepts. Ancient and medieval peoples believed saffron could be used to treat a wide range of ailments, from stomach upsets to the plague.\n\n<blockquote>\"Saffron, for example, was once less regarded than it is today because the crocus from which it is extracted was not particularly mysterious. It flourished in European locations extending from Asia Minor, where it originated, to Saffron Walden in England, where it was naturalised. Only subsequently, when its labour-intensive cultivation became largely centred in Kashmir, did it seem sufficiently exotic to qualify as one of the most precious of spices.\"<ref>Keay (2005), pp. 19-20.</ref></blockquote>Saffron crocus cultivation has long centered on a broad belt of Eurasia bounded by the Mediterranean Sea in the southwest to India and China in the northeast. The major producers of antiquity&mdash;Iran, Spain, India, and Greece&mdash;continue to dominate the world trade.\n\nThe cultivation of saffron in the Americas was begun by members of the [[Schwenkfelder Church]] in Pennsylvania. In recent decades cultivation has spread to New Zealand, Tasmania, and California. Iran has accounted for around 90&ndash;93 percent of recent annual world production and thereby dominates the export market on a by-quantity basis.{{Sfn|Ghorbani|2008|p=1}} Indian kashmiri saffron is considered the finest and most expensive of all saffron.\n\n==Modern trade==\n[[File:Saffron crocus sativus production.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|\n{|\n|-\n| Producing regions: || {{Legend|#800000|major}} || {{Legend|#FF5555|minor}}\n|-\n| Producing nations: || {{Legend|#FF0000|major}} || {{Legend|#FFAEAE|minor}}\n|-\n| Trading centres: || {{Legend|#97CBFF|present}} || {{Legend|#6600CC|past}}\n|}\n]]\n\n===Producers===\n\nAlmost all saffron grows in a belt bounded by the Mediterranean in the west and mountainous Kashmir in the east. All other continents except Antarctica produce smaller amounts. In 1991, Some {{Convert|300|t|kg|0|abbr=on}} of whole threads and powder are gleaned yearly,{{Sfn|Katzer|2010}} of which {{Convert|50|t|kg|0|abbr=on}} is top-grade \"coupe\" saffron.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=2}} Iran is by far the world's most important producer: in 2005 it grossed some {{Convert|230|t|kg}} of dry threads, or 93.7 percent of the year's global total mass; much of the Iranian crop was bound for export.{{Sfn|Ghorbani|2008|p=1}} In the same year, second-ranked Greece produced {{Convert|5.7|t|kg|1|abbr=on}}. Morocco and India's (most of the region's saffron is grown in the more climatically suitable \"Valley of Kashmir\",  which is in Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir) region of Kashmir, tied as the next-highest producer, each produced {{Convert|2.3|t|kg|1|abbr=on}}. Kashmiri saffron is considered the finest and most expensive of all kind of saffron.{{Sfn|Ghorbani|2008|p=1}} In decreasing order, Iran, Greece, Morocco and Kashmir valley (Jammu and Kashmir-India), Azerbaijan, Spain, and Italy dominate the world harvest.\n\nIn Iran, the world's leading producer, the erstwhile and northeasterly [[Khorasan Province]], which in 2004 was divided in three, grows 95 percent of Iranian saffron: the hinterlands of [[Birjand]], [[Ghayen]], [[Ferdows]] in [[South Khorasan Province]], along with areas abutting [[Gonabad]] and [[Torbat-e Heydarieh]] in [[Razavi Khorasan Province]], are its key cropping areas.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=24}} Afghanistan has resumed cultivation in recent years. Despite numerous cultivation efforts in such countries as Austria, England, Germany, and Switzerland, only select locales continue the harvest in northern and central Europe. Among these is the small Swiss village of Mund, in the Valais canton, whose annual saffron output amounts to several kilograms.{{Sfn|Katzer|2010}} Microscale cultivation occurs in Tasmania,{{Sfn|Courtney|2002}} China, Egypt, France, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Turkey (especially [[Safranbolu]]), California, and Central Africa.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=272}}{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}}\n\n{{Multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|width=150|image1=Crocus sativus sahuran.jpg|image2=Crocus sativus1.jpg|caption2=<center>''C. sativus.''</center>}}\n\n===Price===\n====Factors determining costs====\nThe high cost of saffron is due to the difficulty of manually extracting large numbers of minute stigmas, which are the only part of the crocus with the desired aroma and flavour. An exorbitant number of flowers need to be processed in order to yield marketable amounts of saffron. Obtaining {{Convert|1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of dry saffron requires the harvesting of some 50,000 flowers, the equivalent of an association football pitch's area of cultivation, or roughly {{Convert|7140|m2|ha|3|abbr=on}}.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=273}} By another estimate some 75,000 flowers are needed to produce one pound of dry saffron.{{Sfn|Rau|1969|p=35}} This too depends on the typical stigma size of each saffron cultivar. Another complication arises in the flowers' simultaneous and transient blooming. Since so many crocus flowers are needed to yield even derisory quantities of dry saffron, the harvest can be a frenetic affair entailing about forty hours of intense labour. In Kashmir, the thousands of growers must work continuously in relays over the span of one or two weeks throughout both day and night.{{Sfn|Lak|1998}}\n\nOnce extracted, the stigmas must be dried quickly, lest decomposition or mould ruin the batch's marketability. The traditional method of drying involves spreading the fresh stigmas over screens of fine mesh, which are then baked over hot coals or wood or in oven-heated rooms where temperatures reach {{Convert|30|&ndash;|35|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} for 10&ndash;12&nbsp;hours. Afterwards the dried spice is preferably sealed in airtight glass containers.{{refn|Pure saffron stigmas will often be mixed with stamens to add \"dead\"&mdash;read: \"worthless\"&mdash;weight. To put it mildly, stamens have little culinary appeal but will still add the signature yellow color of saffron. Powdered saffron should be red-orange rather than yellowish in colour.|group=N}}{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=8}}\n\n====Actual prices====\nBulk quantities of lower-grade saffron can reach upwards of {{USD}}500 per pound; retail costs for small amounts may exceed ten times that rate. In Western countries the average retail price is approximately US$1,000 per pound.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=272}} Indian Kashmiri saffron is considered best quality and most expensive saffron and has a high demand in world's spice market. Prices vary widely elsewhere, but on average tend to be lower. The high price is somewhat offset by the small quantities needed in kitchens: a few grams at most in medicinal use and a few strands, at most, in culinary applications; there are between 70,000 and 200,000 strands in a pound.\n\nA price set during 2014 for Saffron grown within England was \u00a315 for 0.2. grams, this being sold at [[Fortnum & Mason]], and a gram priced at a value with a maximum of \u00a375.<ref>L.

They may look for threads exhibiting a vivid crimson colouring, slight moistness, and elasticity. They reject threads displaying the telltale dull brick-red colouring&mdash;indicative of old stock&mdash;and broken-off debris collected at the container's bottom, indicative of age-related brittle dryness. Such aged samples are most likely encountered around the main June harvest season, when retailers attempt to clear out the previous season's old inventory and make room for the new season's crop. Buyers recommend that only the current season's threads be used. Reputable saffron wholesalers and retailers will indicate the year of harvest or the two years that bracket the harvest date; a late 2002 harvest would thus be shown as \"2002/2003\".{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=274}}\n\n==Culinary use==\n[[File:01_Paella_Valenciana_original.jpg|thumb|Saffron is one of three key ingredients in ''[[paella|paella valenciana]]'']]\nSaffron features in European, North African, and Asian cuisines. Its aroma is described by taste experts as resembling that of honey, with woody, hay-like, and earthy notes; according to another such assessment, it tastes of hay, but only with bitter hints. Because it imparts a luminous yellow-orange hue, it is used worldwide in everything from cheeses, confectioneries, and liquors to baked goods, curries, meat dishes, and soups. In past eras, many dishes called for prohibitively copious amounts&mdash;hardly for taste, but to parade their wealth.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=275}}\n\nIn Kashmir, saffron is used in ''kehva'', an aromatic beverage made from saffron, almonds, wallnuts, cardamom etc. It is also used in Kashmiri marriage and occasional cuisine namely ''Wazwan'', where chicken is cooked in its heated aromatic solution, and the dish is known as ''konge kokur'' in local language.\n\nBecause of its high cost saffron was often replaced by or diluted with [[safflower]] (''Carthamus tinctorius'') or [[turmeric]] (''Curcuma longa'') in cuisine. Both mimic saffron's colour well, but have distinctive flavours. Saffron is used in the confectionery and liquor industries; this is its most common use in Italy.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=59}} [[Chartreuse (liqueur)|Chartreuse]], [[izarra (liqueur)|izarra]], and [[strega (liqueur)|strega]] are types of alcoholic beverages that rely on saffron to provide a flourish of colour and flavour. Saffron threads are often crumbled and pre-soaked in water or sherry for several minutes prior to adding them to a dish. This process [[solvent extraction|extract]]s the threads' colour and flavour into the liquid phase; powdered saffron does not require this step.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=203}} The soaking solution is then added to the hot cooking dish, allowing even colour and flavour distribution, which is critical in preparing baked goods or thick sauces.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=275}}\n\n{{Cookbook|Saffron}}\n\nThreads are a popular condiment for rice in Spain and Iran, India and Pakistan, and other countries. Two examples of such [[saffron rice]] is the ''zarzuela'' fish-seafood stew and ''[[paella|paella valenciana]]'', a piquant rice-meat preparation. It is essential in making the French ''[[bouillabaisse]]'', which is a spicy fish stew from Marseilles, and the Italian ''[[risotto]] alla milanese''.\n\n[[File:Saffron bun 20051213 001.jpg|thumb|A Swedish-style saffron bun, traditionally consumed before Christmas]]\nThe [[saffron bun]] has Swedish and Cornish variants and in Swedish is known as ''lussekatt'' (literally \"Lucy cat\", after [[Saint Lucy]]) or ''lussebulle''. The latter is a rich yeast dough bun that is enhanced with saffron, along with [[cinnamon]] or [[nutmeg]] and [[Ribes|currant]]s. They are typically eaten during Advent, and especially on [[Saint Lucy's Day]]. In England, the saffron \"revel buns\" were traditionally baked for anniversary feasts (revels) or for church dedications. In the West of Cornwall, large saffron \"tea treat buns\" signify Methodist Sunday School outings and activities.\n\nIn traditional dishes of [[La Mancha]], Spain, the spice is almost ubiquitous.<ref name=\"J.

It is a key recipe in the ''[[chermoula]]'' herb mixture that flavors many Moroccan dishes. Due to its high price, it is mostly used while cooking for special occasions as well as in some Moroccan high-end recipes like the [[pastilla]]. Other Moroccan dishes cooked with saffron include some types of ''[[tajine|tajines]]'', ''kefta'' (meatballs with tomato), ''mqualli'' (a [[citron]]-chicken dish), and ''mrouzia'' (succulent lamb dressed with plums and almonds).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://moroccanzest.com/moroccan-spices/|title=Essential Moroccan Spices for Moroccan Cooking - Moroccan Zest|date=2018-11-11|work=Moroccan Zest|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nUzbeks use it in a special rice-based offering known as \"wedding ''[[plov]]''\" (cf. [[pilaf]]). Saffron is also essential in ''[[chelow kabab]]'', the Iranian national dish. The use of saffron in south Indian cuisine is perhaps best characterised by the eponymous [[Kesari bhath]]<ref>Kesari is the Kannada word for Saffron</ref> - a semolina based dessert from Karnataka. South Asian cuisines also use saffron in ''[[biryani]]s'', which are spicy rice-vegetable dishes. (An example is the ''Pakki'' variety of ''[[Hyderabadi Biryani|Hyderabadi biryani]]''.) Saffron spices subcontinental beef and chicken entrees and goes into many sweets, particularly in Muslim and Rajasthani fare. Modern technology has added another delicacy to the list: saffron ice cream. Regional milk-based sweets feature it,{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}} among them ''[[gulab jamun]]'', ''[[kulfi]]'', ''[[Double Ka Meetha|double ka meetha]]'', and \"saffron ''[[lassi]]''\"; the last is a sweet yogurt-based Jodhpuri drink that is culturally symbolic.\n\n==Colouring==\n{{See also|Saffron (color)}}\n[[File:Chinese Buddhist Monks Ceremony Hangzhou.jpeg|thumb|Buddhist monks in Hangzhou, China]]Despite its high cost, saffron has been used as a fabric dye, particularly in China and India. It is in the long run an ''unstable'' colouring agent; the imparted vibrant orange-yellow hue quickly fades to a pale and creamy yellow.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=205}} Even in minute amounts, the saffron stamens yield a luminous yellow-orange; increasing the applied saffron concentration will give fabric of increasingly rich shades of red. Clothing dyed with saffron was traditionally reserved for the noble classes, implying that saffron played a ritualised and status-keying role. It was originally responsible for the vermilion-, ochre-, and saffron-hued robes and mantles worn by Buddhist and Hindu monks. In medieval Ireland and Scotland, well-to-do monks wore a long linen undershirt known as a ''l\u00e9ine'', which was traditionally dyed with saffron.{{Sfn|Major|1892|p=49}} In histology the [[hematoxylin]]-[[phloxine]]-saffron [[HPS stain|(HPS) stain]] and [[Movat's pentachrome]] stain are used as a tissue stain to make biological structures more visible under a microscope.<ref name=\"Sigdel\">{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Sigdel | first1 = S. \n| last2 = Gemind | first2 = J.

Saffron's usual substitutes in food&mdash;turmeric and safflower, among others&mdash;yield a garishly bright yellow that could hardly be confused with that of saffron. Saffron's main colourant is the [[carotenoid]] [[crocin]]; it has been discovered in the less tediously harvested&mdash;and hence less costly&mdash;[[gardenia]] fruit. Research in China is ongoing.{{Sfn|Dharmananda|2005}} \n\n==Perfumery==\nIn Europe saffron threads were a key component of an aromatic oil known as ''crocinum'', which comprised such motley ingredients as [[Anchusa officinalis|alkanet]], [[dragon's blood]] (for colour), and wine (again for colour). ''Crocinum'' was applied as a perfume to hair. Another preparation involved mixing saffron with wine to produce a viscous yellow spray; it was copiously applied in sudoriferously sunny Roman amphitheatres&mdash;as an air freshener.{{Sfn|Dalby|2002|p=138}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of saffron]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=N}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n'''Books'''\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=33em}}\n* {{Citation|last=Dalby |first=A.|author-link=Andrew Dalby|year=2002|title=Dangerous Tastes: The Story of Spices|edition=1st|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23674-5<!--0520236742-->|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7IHcZ21dyjwC}}\n* {{Citation|last=Grigg |first=D.

Typically, Bounce Rate for e-commerce websites is in the range of 20% to 45% <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://conversionxl.com/guides/bounce-rate/benchmarks/|title=Bounce Rate Benchmarks: What's a Good Bounce Rate, Anyway?|website=CXL|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref>, with top performers operating at a 36%<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.similarweb.com/website/ebay.com|title=ebay.com Traffic Statistics|website=SimilarWeb|language=en|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref> average Bounce Rate.\n\n==Construction==\nA bounce occurs when a web site visitor only views a single page on a website, that is, the visitor leaves a site without visiting any other pages before a specified session-timeout occurs.

If the visitor continues to navigate after this delay, a new [[session (web analytics)|session]] will occur.\n\nThe bounce rate for a single page is the number of visitors who enter the site at a page and leave within the specified timeout period without viewing another page, divided by the total number of visitors who entered the site at that page. In contrast, the bounce rate for a web site is the number of web site visitors who visit only a single page of a web site per session divided by the total number of web site visits.\n\n==Caveats==\nWhile site-wide bounce rate can be a useful metric for sites with well-defined conversion steps requiring multiple page views, it may be of questionable value for sites where visitors are likely to find what they are looking for on the entry page.

{"title_page": "AltiVec", "text_new": "{{POWER, PowerPC, and Power ISA}}\n'''AltiVec''' is a single-precision [[floating point]] and integer [[SIMD]] [[instruction set]] designed and owned by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[IBM]], and [[Freescale Semiconductor]] (formerly [[Motorola]]'s Semiconductor Products Sector) &mdash; the [[AIM alliance]].  It is implemented on versions of the [[PowerPC]] processor architecture, including Motorola's [[PowerPC G4|G4]], [[IBM]]'s [[PowerPC 970|G5]] and [[POWER6]] processors, and [[P.A. Semi]]'s [[PWRficient]] PA6T.  AltiVec is a [[trademark]] owned solely by Freescale, so the system is also referred to as '''Velocity Engine''' by Apple and '''VMX''' ('''Vector Multimedia Extension''') by IBM and P.A. Semi.\n\nWhile AltiVec refers to an instruction set, the implementations in CPUs produced by IBM and Motorola are separate in terms of logic design. To date, no IBM core has included an AltiVec logic design licensed from Motorola or vice versa.\n\nAltiVec is a standard part of the [[Power ISA#Power ISA v.2.03|Power ISA v.2.03]]<ref name=\"isa203\">{{cite web\n |title     = Power ISA v.2.03\n |publisher = Power.org\n |url       = http://www.power.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PowerISA_203_Final_Public.pdf\n}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> specification. It was never formally a part of the PowerPC architecture until this specification although it used PowerPC instruction formats and syntax and occupied the opcode space expressly allocated for such \npurposes.\n\n==Comparison to x86-64 SSE ==\n\nBoth VMX/AltiVec and [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] feature 128-bit vector registers that can represent sixteen 8-bit signed or unsigned chars, eight 16-bit signed or unsigned shorts, four 32-bit ints or four [[IEEE floating-point standard|32-bit]] floating point variables.  Both provide [[CPU cache|cache]]-control instructions intended to minimize [[cache pollution]] when working on streams of data.\n\nThey also exhibit important differences. Unlike [[SSE2]], VMX/AltiVec supports a special [[RGB color model|RGB]] \"[[pixel]]\" data type, but it does not operate on 64-bit double precision floats, and there is no way to move data directly between scalar and [[vector processor|vector]] registers. In keeping with the \"load/store\" model of the PowerPC's [[RISC]] design, the vector registers, like the scalar registers, can only be loaded from and stored to memory. However, VMX/AltiVec provides a much more complete set of \"horizontal\" operations that work across all the elements of a vector; the allowable combinations of data type and operations are much more complete. Thirty-two 128-bit vector registers are provided, compared to eight for SSE and SSE2 (extended to 16 in [[x86-64]]), and most VMX/AltiVec instructions take three register operands compared to only two register/register or register/memory operands on [[IA-32]].\n\nVMX/AltiVec is also unique in its support for a flexible vector [[permute instruction]], in which each byte of a resulting vector value can be taken from any byte of either of two other vectors, parametrized by yet another vector.  This allows for sophisticated manipulations in a single instruction.\n\nRecent versions of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC), [[IBM VisualAge]] compiler and other compilers provide [[intrinsic function|intrinsics]] to access VMX/AltiVec instructions directly from [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] programs. As of version 4, the GCC also includes [[Automatic vectorization|auto-vectorization]] capabilities that attempt to intelligently create VMX/Altivec accelerated binaries without the need for the programmer to use intrinsics directly. The \"vector\" type keyword is introduced to permit the declaration of native vector types, e.g., \"<code>vector unsigned char foo;</code>\" declares a 128-bit vector variable named \"foo\" containing sixteen 8-bit unsigned chars. The full complement of arithmetic and binary operators is defined on vector types so that the normal C expression language can be used to manipulate vector variables. There are also overloaded intrinsic functions such as \"<code>vec_add</code>\" that emit the appropriate op code based on the type of the elements within the vector, and very strong type checking is enforced. In contrast, the Intel-defined data types for IA-32 SIMD registers declare only the size of the vector register (128 or 64 bits) and in the case of a 128-bit register, whether it contains integers or floating point values. The programmer must select the appropriate intrinsic for the data types in use, e.g., \"<code>_mm_add_epi16(x,y)</code>\" for adding two vectors containing eight 16-bit integers.\n\n==Development history==\nThe Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) was developed between 1996 and 1998 by a collaborative project between Apple, IBM, and Motorola. \nApple was the primary customer for Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) until Apple switched to Intel-made, x86-based CPUs on June 6, 2005. They used it to accelerate [[multimedia]] applications such as [[QuickTime]], [[iTunes]] and key parts of Apple's [[Mac OS X]] including in the [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz graphics compositor]].  Other companies such as Adobe used AltiVec to optimize their image-processing programs such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. Motorola was the first to supply AltiVec enabled processors starting with their G4 line.  AltiVec was also used in some embedded systems for high-performance digital signal processing.\n\nIBM consistently left VMX out of their earlier [[IBM POWER microprocessors|POWER microprocessors]], which were intended for server applications where it was not very useful. The [[POWER6]] microprocessor, introduced in 2007, implements AltiVec. The last desktop microprocessor from IBM, the [[PowerPC 970]] (dubbed the \"G5\" by Apple) also implemented AltiVec with hardware similar to that of the [[PowerPC G4|PowerPC 7400]].\n\nAltiVec is a brandname trademarked by Freescale (previously Motorola) for the standard ''Category:Vector'' part of the [[Power ISA#Power ISA v.2.03|Power ISA v.2.03]]<ref name=\"isa203\" /> specification.  This Category is also known as VMX (used by IBM), and \"Velocity Engine\" (a brand name previously used by Apple).\n\nThe [[Cell microprocessor|Cell]] Broadband Engine, used in (amongst other things) the [[PlayStation 3]], also supports Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) in its PPU, with the SPU ISA being enhanced but architecturally similar.\n\nFreescale is bringing an enhanced version of AltiVec to [[PowerPC e6500|e6500]] based [[QorIQ]] processors.\n\n=== VMX128 ===\nIBM enhanced VMX for use in [[Xenon (processor)|Xenon]] (Xbox 360) and called this enhancement VMX128.

However, it may be possible to combine them using compiler-specific workarounds; for instance, in GCC one may do <code>#undef vector</code> to remove the <code>vector</code> keyword, and then use the GCC-specific <code>__vector</code> keyword in its place.\n\nAltiVec also lacks 64-bit integer support. Developers who wish to operate on 64-bit data will develop routines from 32-bit components. For example, below are examples of a 64-bit <tt>add</tt> and <tt>subtract</tt> in C using an AltiVec <tt>vector unsigned int</tt>.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.
