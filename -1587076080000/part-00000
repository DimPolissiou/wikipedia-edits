For instance, both animal sacrifice and the shaving of an initiate's head are usually reserved for male practitioners, while female practitioners are typically responsible for domestic duties in maintaining the ritual space.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=22}} Such divisions mirror broader gender norms in Brazilian society.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=22}}\n\nThere is evidence that Candombl\u00e9 encourages forms of sexual and gender non-conformity at odds with mainstream Brazilian society.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=20}} Although many prominent male priests in the religion have been heterosexual, there is also a pervasive stereotype that the majority of Candombl\u00e9's male practitioners are homosexual.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=21}}\nMale homosexuals have described the religion as offering a more welcoming environment for them than forms of Christianity practiced in Brazil.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=20}} They for instance have cited stories of relationships between male orishas, such as Ox\u00f4ssi and Ossain, as affirming male same-sex attraction.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=20}}\n\n==Practices==\n[[File:AX\u00c9 IL\u00ca OB\u00c1 09.jpg|thumb|right|A ''terreiro'' in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil]]\n\nThose engaging in Candombl\u00e9 include various initiates of varying degrees and non-initiates who may attend events and approach initiates seeking help with various problems.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=116}}\n\nA house in which Candombl\u00e9 is practiced is known as a ''[[terreiros]]''.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=104}} These range in size from small houses to large compounds.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=116}} They contain an altar to the deities, a space to perform ceremonies, and accommodation for the priests or priestesses.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=116}} \nThe prominent place of priestesses within Candombl\u00e9 has led some observers to describe it as a matriarchal religion, although such a characterisation has been disputed.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=20}}\n\nPublic ceremonies take place at the terreiros where both initiates and non-initiates can attend to celebrate the orishas.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=121}} At these, food is offered to specific orichas while the rest is shared among participants, with the latter thereby gaining some of the ache of the orichas.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=121}} These public rites are both preceded and succeeded by a range of private ritual acts.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=121}}\nMost of the rituals that take place at the terreiros are private and open only to initiates.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=121}} Walker believed that it was these that represented \"the real core of the religious life of the Candombl\u00e9 community.\"{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=121}}\n\nYoruba is used as a ritual language.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=107}} There are no specific sacred texts.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=124}}\nRitual objects are regarded as loci and accumulators of ashe, although this supply needs replenishing at various intervals.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=123}} Each terreiro is also regarded as having its own ashe, which is strengthened by the number of initiates it has and the number of rituals it carries out.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=123}}\n\nPriests and priestesses are regarded as intermediaries between the orishas and humanity.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=116}} Becoming initiated implies a relationship of mutual responsibility between the new initiate and the orishas.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=116}}\n\n===Initiation===\nThe length of the initiatory process varies between Candombl\u00e9 houses but usually lasts from a few weeks to a few months.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=120}} During much of this process, the initiate is usually secluded in a special room;{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=120}} the rite is private.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=122}} During this period they are taught the various details of their associated orisha, such as its likes and dislikes and the appropriate drum rhythms and dances that invoke that deity.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=120}} They will be bathed in water mixed with herbs.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=120}} Their head will often also be shaved. {{sfn|Walker|1990|p=120}}\n\nOne of the first acts during the initiatory process is to give the initiate a string of beads associated with their orisha.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=119}} These beads will often be washed and sprinkled with the blood of a sacrificed animal.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=119}} These beads are sometimes perceived as protecting the wearer from harm.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=104}}\n\nAt a subsequent level of initiation, the orisha is \"seated\" within the individual's head. {{sfn|Walker|1990|p=119}}\nFollowing the initiation, the new initiate may be presented to the rest of the community through a public ceremony.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=122}} Over the course of the following year, the initiate may conduct further \"obligations\" to build their relationship with the orisha.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=122}}\n\n===Possession===\nWithin Candombl\u00e9, it is regarded as a privilege to be possessed by an orisha.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=120}}\n\nThe city of Salvador in Bahia is regarded as a holy city by practitioners of Candombl\u00e9.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=103}}\n\n===Healing===\n\nOne type of ceremony is known as the ''bori''. This entails placing food on the individual's head to feed the orisha that is believed to partially reside within the cranium.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=122}} This may be conducted to bolster the individual's health and well-being or to give them additional strength before an important undertaking.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=122}}\n\n== History ==\nCandombl\u00e9 originated among enslaved Africans who were transplanted to Brazil during the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref name=\"BBCHis\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/candomble/history/history.shtml \"History of Candombl\u00e9\"]. BBC. 15 September 2009. Retrieved 7 January 2014.</ref> From the earliest days of the slave trade, many slave owners and [[Catholic Church]] leaders felt it was important to convert enslaved Africans.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /> They believed this would fulfill their religious obligations and lead the enslaved to be more submissive in their status.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /> Some historians <!--who?-->suggest that Africans were forced to give up their traditional religions to cut their ties to their pasts.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /> Bahia had the highest concentration of these enslaved Africans in Brazil.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=19}}\n\nAlthough the Church succeeded in many cases, not all slaves converted.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /> Many outwardly practiced Christianity but secretly prayed to their own God, gods, or ancestor spirits.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /> In Brazil, adherents of Candombl\u00e9 saw in the Catholic [[Veneration|veneration of saints]] a similarity with their own religion. Bantu followers found a shared system of worship with Brazil's indigenous people, <!--What does this mean?  -->and through this connection they re-learned the ancestor worship that was part of their own traditional systems.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /> They often concealed the sacred symbols of their deities inside figures of their Catholic saints.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /> In [[racial segregation|segregated]] communities of the country, it was easy to create Catholic fraternities where slaves would meet with each other.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /> These meetings, however, were an opportunity for Candombl\u00e9 worship to be practiced and for feasts to be held on special religious days.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /> They were also opportunities for the enslaved to gather and plan rebellions against their masters.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" />\n\nCandombl\u00e9 was condemned by the Catholic Church. Followers of the faith were persecuted violently, including by government-led public campaigns and police action. Repression of African religion began early in the Portuguese colonial period, with ''calundu'' (spiritual leaders) subject to the [[Inquisition]]. The Brazilian Penal Code of 1850 condemned ''charlatanismo'' (charlatanry) ''curandeirismo'' (quackery). Both Candombl\u00e9 religious leaders and terreiros were attacked by the police. With Catholicism as the state religion, other religious practices threatened the secular authority.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /><ref name=\"enc\"/>\n\nStarting from the 1940s, sociologists and anthropologists of religion studied Candombl\u00e9 sympathetically. French sociologist [[Roger Bastide]], who held the chair of Sociology at the [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo]] between 1938 and 1957, emerged both as a main scholar and a defender of religious freedom of Candombl\u00e9. One paradoxical effect of Bastide's and other scholars\u2019 interest in Candombl\u00e9 was that their works were read by leading practitioners of Candombl\u00e9 themselves and contributed to the \u201ccodification\u201d<ref>V\u00e9ronique Boyer, \u201cLe don et l\u2019initiation.

It is particularly popular in [[Salvador, Bahia]], in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeast region of Brazil]], which is more isolated from other influences and had a high percentage of enslaved Africans. Many people from African countries visit Bahia in order to learn more about the faith of their ancestors. For many followers, Candombl\u00e9 is not only a matter of religious belief but also of reclaiming the cultural and historical identity of ethnic Africans, although their separate tribal identities have been obscured by peoples being mixed in communities during and after slavery.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" />\n\nBy the late 20th century, Candombl\u00e9 was gaining increased respectability within Brazil.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=106}} This was partly fuelled by well-educated Afro-Brazilians embracing their cultural heritage, which had previously been stigmatised.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=108}} In the closing decades of the 20th century, some practitioners sought to remove Roman Catholic-influenced aspects from the religion to return it to its West African roots.{{sfn|Walker|1990|pp=114-115}}\n\n== Candombl\u00e9 nations ==\nBrazilian slaves came from a number of African geographic regions and [[ethnic group]]s, including [[Ambundu|Mbundu]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Kongo people|Kongo]], [[Fon people|Fon]] and [[Ewe people|Ewe]]. Slave handlers classified them by the shore of embarkment, so records of ethnicity may not have been accurate, as captives were often transported overland away from native areas before being loaded on ships. As the religion developed semi-independently in different regions of Brazil, among different African ethnic groups, it evolved into several \"branches\" or ''nations'' (''na\u00e7\u00f5es''). These are distinguished chiefly by their set of worshiped deities, as well as the [[sacred music|music]] and [[sacred language|language used in the rituals]].\n\nThe division into nations was also influenced by the religious and beneficent brotherhoods (''irmandades'')  organized by the Catholic Church among Brazilian slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries. These fraternities, organized along ethnic lines to allow priests to preach who had learned the slaves' native languages, provided a legitimate cover for slave reunions.

For instance, both animal sacrifice and the shaving of an initiate's head are usually reserved for male practitioners, while female practitioners are typically responsible for domestic duties in maintaining the ritual space.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=22}} Such divisions mirror broader gender norms in Brazilian society.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=22}}\n\nThere is evidence that Candombl\u00e9 encourages forms of sexual and gender non-conformity at odds with mainstream Brazilian society.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=20}} Although many prominent male priests in the religion have been heterosexual, there is also a pervasive stereotype that the majority of Candombl\u00e9's male practitioners are homosexual.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=21}}\nMale homosexuals have described the religion as offering a more welcoming environment for them than forms of Christianity practiced in Brazil.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=20}} They for instance have cited stories of relationships between male orishas, such as Ox\u00f4ssi and Ossain, as affirming male same-sex attraction.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=20}}\n\n==Practices==\n[[File:AX\u00c9 IL\u00ca OB\u00c1 09.jpg|thumb|right|A ''terreiro'' in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil]]\n\nThose engaging in Candombl\u00e9 include various initiates of varying degrees and non-initiates who may attend events and approach initiates seeking help with various problems.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=116}}\n\nA house in which Candombl\u00e9 is practiced is known as a ''[[terreiros]]''.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=104}} These range in size from small houses to large compounds.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=116}} They contain an altar to the deities, a space to perform ceremonies, and accommodation for the priests or priestesses.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=116}} \nThe prominent place of priestesses within Candombl\u00e9 has led some observers to describe it as a matriarchal religion, although such a characterisation has been disputed.{{sfn|Allen|2012|p=20}}\n\nPublic ceremonies take place at the terreiros where both initiates and non-initiates can attend to celebrate the orishas.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=121}} At these, food is offered to specific orichas while the rest is shared among participants, with the latter thereby gaining some of the ache of the orichas.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=121}} These public rites are both preceded and succeeded by a range of private ritual acts.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=121}}\nMost of the rituals that take place at the terreiros are private and open only to initiates.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=121}} Walker believed that it was these that represented \"the real core of the religious life of the Candombl\u00e9 community.\"{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=121}}\n\nYoruba is used as a ritual language.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=107}} There are no specific sacred texts.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=124}}\nRitual objects are regarded as loci and accumulators of ashe, although this supply needs replenishing at various intervals.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=123}} Each terreiro is also regarded as having its own ashe, which is strengthened by the number of initiates it has and the number of rituals it carries out.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=123}}\n\nPriests and priestesses are regarded as intermediaries between the orishas and humanity.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=116}} Becoming initiated implies a relationship of mutual responsibility between the new initiate and the orishas.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=116}}\n\n===Initiation===\nThe length of the initiatory process varies between Candombl\u00e9 houses but usually lasts from a few weeks to a few months.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=120}} During much of this process, the initiate is usually secluded in a special room;{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=120}} the rite is private.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=122}} During this period they are taught the various details of their associated orisha, such as its likes and dislikes and the appropriate drum rhythms and dances that invoke that deity.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=120}} They will be bathed in water mixed with herbs.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=120}} Their head will often also be shaved. {{sfn|Walker|1990|p=120}}\n\nOne of the first acts during the initiatory process is to give the initiate a string of beads associated with their orisha.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=119}} These beads will often be washed and sprinkled with the blood of a sacrificed animal.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=119}} These beads are sometimes perceived as protecting the wearer from harm.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=104}}\n\nAt a subsequent level of initiation, the orisha is \"seated\" within the individual's head. {{sfn|Walker|1990|p=119}}\nFollowing the initiation, the new initiate may be presented to the rest of the community through a public ceremony.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=122}} Over the course of the following year, the initiate may conduct further \"obligations\" to build their relationship with the orisha.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=122}}\n\n===Possession===\nWithin Candombl\u00e9, it is regarded as a privilege to be possessed by an orisha.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=120}}\n\nThe city of Salvador in Bahia is regarded as a holy city by practitioners of Candombl\u00e9.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=103}}\n\n===Healing===\n\nOne type of ceremony is known as the ''bori''. This entails placing food on the individual's head to feed the orisha that is believed to partially reside within the cranium.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=122}} This may be conducted to bolster the individual's health and well-being or to give them additional strength before an important undertaking.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=122}}\n\n== History ==\nCandombl\u00e9 originated among enslaved Africans who were transplanted to Brazil during the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref name=\"BBCHis\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/candomble/history/history.shtml \"History of Candombl\u00e9\"].

Bantu followers found a shared system of worship with Brazil's indigenous people, <!--What does this mean?  -->and through this connection they re-learned the ancestor worship that was part of their own traditional systems.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /> They often concealed the sacred symbols of their deities inside figures of their Catholic saints.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /> In [[racial segregation|segregated]] communities of the country, it was easy to create Catholic fraternities where slaves would meet with each other.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /> These meetings, however, were an opportunity for Candombl\u00e9 worship to be practiced and for feasts to be held on special religious days.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /> They were also opportunities for the enslaved to gather and plan rebellions against their masters.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" />\n\nCandombl\u00e9 was condemned by the Catholic Church. Followers of the faith were persecuted violently, including by government-led public campaigns and police action. Repression of African religion began early in the Portuguese colonial period, with ''calundu'' (spiritual leaders) subject to the [[Inquisition]]. The Brazilian Penal Code of 1850 condemned ''charlatanismo'' (charlatanry) ''curandeirismo'' (quackery). Both Candombl\u00e9 religious leaders and terreiros were attacked by the police. With Catholicism as the state religion, other religious practices threatened the secular authority.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" /><ref name=\"enc\"/>\n\nStarting from the 1940s, sociologists and anthropologists of religion studied Candombl\u00e9 sympathetically. French sociologist [[Roger Bastide]], who held the chair of Sociology at the [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo]] between 1938 and 1957, emerged both as a main scholar and a defender of religious freedom of Candombl\u00e9. One paradoxical effect of Bastide\u2019s and other scholars\u2019 interest in Candombl\u00e9 was that their works were read by leading practitioners of Candombl\u00e9 themselves and contributed to the \u201ccodification\u201d<ref>V\u00e9ronique Boyer, \u201cLe don et l\u2019initiation.

It is particularly popular in [[Salvador, Bahia]], in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeast region of Brazil]], which is more isolated from other influences and had a high percentage of enslaved Africans. Many people from African countries visit Bahia in order to learn more about the faith of their ancestors. For many followers, Candombl\u00e9 is not only a matter of religious belief but also of reclaiming the cultural and historical identity of ethnic Africans, although their separate tribal identities have been obscured by peoples being mixed in communities during and after slavery.<ref name=\"BBCHis\" />\n\nBy the late 20th century, Candombl\u00e9 was gaining increased respectability within Brazil.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=106}} This was partly fuelled by well-educated Afro-Brazilians embracing their cultural heritage, which had previously been stigmatised.{{sfn|Walker|1990|p=108}} In the closing decades of the 20th century, some practitioners sought to remove Roman Catholic-influenced aspects from the religion to return it to its West African roots.{{sfn|Walker|1990|pp=114-115}}\n\n== Candombl\u00e9 nations ==\nBrazilian slaves came from a number of African geographic regions and [[ethnic group]]s, including [[Ambundu|Mbundu]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Kongo people|Kongo]], [[Fon people|Fon]] and [[Ewe people|Ewe]]. Slave handlers classified them by the shore of embarkment, so records of ethnicity may not have been accurate, as captives were often transported overland away from native areas before being loaded on ships. As the religion developed semi-independently in different regions of Brazil, among different African ethnic groups, it evolved into several \"branches\" or ''nations'' (''na\u00e7\u00f5es''). These are distinguished chiefly by their set of worshiped deities, as well as the [[sacred music|music]] and [[sacred language|language used in the rituals]].\n\nThe division into nations was also influenced by the religious and beneficent brotherhoods (''irmandades'')  organized by the Catholic Church among Brazilian slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries. These fraternities, organized along ethnic lines to allow priests to preach who had learned the slaves' native languages, provided a legitimate cover for slave reunions. Ultimately they may have aided the development of Candombl\u00e9.\n\nThe following list is a rough classification of the major nations and sub-nations, and their sacred languages:\n* [[Candombl\u00e9 Ketu|Ketu]] or Queto \u2013 [[Yoruba language]], known as ''Iorub\u00e1'' or ''Nag\u00f4'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

She subsequently combined ideas from Candombl\u00e9 with those of [[Gnosticism]] in her depiction of the religion pursued by \"The Convent\", an all-female community in her 1991 novel ''[[Paradise (novel)|Paradise]]''.{{sfn|Marouan|2007|pp=111, 118}}\nThemes from the religion have also been included in the work of Brazilian filmmaker [[Glauber Rocha]].{{sfn|Walker|1990|pp=106-107}} References to the religion also appeared in Brazilian popular music. For instance, [[Maria Beth\u00e2nia]] and [[Gal Costa]]'s song \"Prayer to M\u00e3e Menininha\" made it into the country's chart.{{sfn|Paula Adinolfi|Van de Port|2013|p=292}}\n\nAlthough objects associated with Candombl\u00e9 were initially found only in police museums, thus underscoring the stereotypical association between the religion and criminality, as it gained greater public acceptance such objects eventually came to be featured in museums devoted to folklore and Afro-Brazilian culture.{{sfn|Paula Adinolfi|Van de Port|2013|pp=288\u2013289}} From the 1990s onward, practitioners began establishing their own museum displays within their terreiros.{{sfn|Paula Adinolfi|Van de Port|2013|p=289}} For instance, the bedroom of the famous Candombl\u00e9 priestess [[M\u00e3e Menininha do Gantois]], located within her Bahia terreiro, was converted into a memorial within in 1992 and then formally recognised as a heritage site in 2002.{{sfn|Paula Adinolfi|Van de Port|2013|pp=284\u2013285}} Candombl\u00e9 practitioners have also lobbied other museums to change the way that the latter display items associated with the religion. For instance, practitioners successfully called upon the [[Museum of the City of Salvador]] to remove some ''ot\u00e1'' stones from public display, arguing that according to the regulations of the religion such items should never be visible to the public.{{sfn|Paula Adinolfi|Van de Port|2013|p=290}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Candombl\u00e9 Jej\u00e9]]\n* [[Candombl\u00e9 Ketu]]\n* [[Candombl\u00e9 Bantu]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"enc\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Serra |first=Ordep |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Latin American Religions |chapter=Candombl\u00e9 |date=2018 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-08956-0_524-1 |isbn=978-3-319-08956-0 |pages=1\u20139 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"schmidt\">{{cite book |last=Schmidt |first1=Bettina E. |title=Contemporary Religions in Brazil |volume=1 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2016 |page=7 |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935420.013.50 }}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite article |last=Allen |first=Andrea Stevenson |title=\"Brides\" without Husbands: Lesbians in the Afro-Brazilian Religion Candombl\u00e9 |year=2012 |journal=Transforming Anthropology |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=17\u201331 |doi=10.1111/j.1548-7466.2011.01141.x |ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite contribution |last=Marouan |first=Maha |year=2007 |contribution=Candombl\u00e9, Christianity, and Gnosticism in Tony Morrison's ''Paradise'' |title=The African Diaspora and the Study of Religion |editor=Theodore Louis Trost  |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |pages=111\u2013127 |isbn=978-1403977861 |ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite article |last1=Paula Adinolfi |first1=Maria |last2=Van de Port |first2=Mattijs |year=2013 |title=Bed and Throne: The \"Museumification\" of the Living Quarters of a Candombl\u00e9 Priestess |journal=Material Religion |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=282\u2013303 |doi=10.2752/175183413X13730330868915 |ref=harv}}\n\n:{{cite article |first=Sheila |last=Walker |title=Everyday and Esoteric Reality in the Afro-Brazilian Candombl\u00e9 |journal=History of Religions |volume=30 |number=2 |year=1990 |pages=103-128 |jstor=1062896 |ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== Books ==\n* {{cite book | first=Roger | last=Bastide | authorlink=Roger Bastide | orig-year=First published 1958 | year=1961 | location=[[Brazil]] | publisher={{ill|Companhia Editora Nacional|pt}} | translator-last=Queiroz | translator-first=Maria Isaura Pereira | title=O Candombl\u00e9 da Bahia (Rito Nag\u00f4) | trans-title=The Candombl\u00e9 of Bahia ([[Nagos|Nag\u00f4]] Rite) | volume=313 | language=Portuguese | url=https://bdor.sibi.ufrj.br/bitstream/doc/361/1/313%20PDF%20-%20OCR%20-%20RED.pdf | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190318165840/https://bdor.sibi.ufrj.br/bitstream/doc/361/1/313%20PDF%20-%20OCR%20-%20RED.pdf | accessdate=2019-03-18 | archivedate=2019-03-18 }}\n* {{cite book | first=Serge | last=Bramley | authorlink=Serge Bramly | title=Macumba: The Teachings of Maria-Jos\u00e9, Mother of the Gods | year=1979 | orig-year=First published 1975 in Paris, France | location=Brazil | publisher=[[Avon (publisher)|Avon]] | isbn=978-0-380-42317-0 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/macumbateachings00bram }}\n* {{ cite book | first=Diana DeGroat | last=Brown | title=Umbanda: Religion and Politics in Urban Brazil | year=1994 | publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] | isbn=978-0-231-10005-2 }}\n* {{ cite book | first=Stefania Capone | last=Laffitte | title=Searching for Africa in Brazil: Power and Tradition in Candombl\u00e9 | translator-first=Lucy Lyall | translator-last=Grant | year=2010 | publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8223-9204-0 }}\n* Carneiro, Edison.  \"The Structure of African Cults in Bahia\"  Civilzacao Brasileira, Rio de Janeiro. 1936\u201337.\n* Gordon, Jacob U.  \" Yoruba Cosmology And Culture in Brazil: A Study of African Survivals in the New World.\" Journal of Black Studies, Vol.10, No 2.
