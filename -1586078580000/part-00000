The show was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] in its first four seasons, and by [[Cartoon Network Studios]] in its final two seasons. It centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three [[kindergarten]]-aged girls with [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]. The girls all live in the fictional city of Townsville, USA with their father and creator, a scientist named Professor Utonium, and are frequently called upon by the city's mayor to help fight nearby criminals and other enemies using their powers.\n\nMcCracken originally developed the show in 1992 as a cartoon short entitled Whoopass Stew! while in his second year at [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]]. Following a name change, Cartoon Network featured the first Powerpuff Girls pilots in its animation showcase program [[What a Cartoon!]] in 1995 and 1996. The series made its official debut as a Cartoon Cartoon on November 18, 1998, with the final episode airing on March 25, 2005. Excluding the two pilot shorts, the series ran for a total of six seasons, totaling 78 episodes. Along with the episodes, a Christmas special and a [[feature film]], ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'', were also made concurrently. Two additional specials were made after the show ceased to air in 2005 which included a tenth-anniversary special (2008), and a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] special (2014), which was made without McCracken's input.\n\nVarious spin-off media include an [[Powerpuff Girls Z|anime]], three CD soundtracks, a home video collection, comic books, a [[List of The Powerpuff Girls video games|series of video games]], a [[The Powerpuff Girls (2016 TV series)|2016 reboot series]], as well as various licensed merchandise. The series has been nominated for six [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Awards]], nine [[Annie Award]]s, and a [[Kids' Choice Award]] during its run. In all, the series won four awards and generally received a positive reception.\n\nIt was the last cartoon produced in [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Studios]], which was closed in [[2001]] after [[William Hanna]]'s death.\n\n==Premise==\nThe show revolves around the adventures of three kindergarten aged girls with an array of various [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]: Blossom (pink), Bubbles (blue), and Buttercup (green). The plot of an episode is usually some humorous variation of standard [[superhero]] and [[tokusatsu]] shows, with the girls using their powers to defend their town from [[villain]]s and giant [[monster movie|monsters]]. In addition, the girls have to deal with the normal issues that young children face, such as sibling rivalries, loose teeth,<ref>{{cite episode|title=Moral Decay|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=February 9, 2001|season=3|number=12A}}</ref> personal hygiene,<ref>{{cite episode|title=Down 'n' Dirty|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=September 10, 1999|season=2|number=5B}}</ref> going to school, [[Nocturnal enuresis|bed wetting]],<ref>{{cite episode|title=Pee Pee G's|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=November 13, 2003|season=5|number=6A}}</ref> or dependence on a [[security blanket]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Cover Up|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=May 26, 2000|season=2|number=11B}}</ref> Episodes often contain hidden references to older pop culture (especially noticeable in the episode \"Meet the Beat Alls\",<ref>{{cite episode|title=Meet the Beat-Alls|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=February 9, 2001|season=3|number=12B}}</ref> which is a homage to [[the Beatles]]).

The show was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] in its first four seasons, and by [[Cartoon Network Studios]] in its final two seasons. It centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three [[kindergarten]]-aged girls with [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]. The girls all live in the fictional city of Townsville, USA with their father and creator, a scientist named Professor Utonium, and are frequently called upon by the city's mayor to help fight nearby criminals and other enemies using their powers.\n\nMcCracken originally developed the show in 1992 as a cartoon short entitled Whoopass Stew! while in his second year at [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]]. Following a name change, Cartoon Network featured the first Powerpuff Girls pilots in its animation showcase program [[What a Cartoon!]] in 1995 and 1996. The series made its official debut as a Cartoon Cartoon on November 18, 1998, with the final episode airing on March 25, 2005. Excluding the two pilot shorts, the series ran for a total of six seasons, totaling 78 episodes. Along with the episodes, a Christmas special and a [[feature film]], ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'', were also made concurrently. Two additional specials were made after the show ceased to air in 2005 which included a tenth-anniversary special (2008), and a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] special (2014), which was made without McCracken's input.\n\nVarious spin-off media include an [[Powerpuff Girls Z|anime]], three CD soundtracks, a home video collection, comic books, a [[List of The Powerpuff Girls video games|series of video games]], a [[The Powerpuff Girls (2016 TV series)|2016 reboot series]], as well as various licensed merchandise. The series has been nominated for six [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Awards]], nine [[Annie Award]]s, and a [[Kids' Choice Award]] during its run. In all, the series won four awards and generally received a positive reception.\n\nIt was the last cartoon produced in [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Studios]], which was closed in [[2001]] after [[William Hanna]]'s death.\n\n==Premise==\nThe show revolves around the adventures of three kindergarten aged girls with an array of various [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]]: Blossom (pink), Bubbles (blue), and Buttercup (green). The plot of an episode is usually some humorous variation of standard [[superhero]] and [[tokusatsu]] shows, with the girls using their powers to defend their town from [[villain]]s and giant [[monster movie|monsters]]. In addition, the girls have to deal with the normal issues that young children face, such as sibling rivalries, loose teeth,<ref>{{cite episode|title=Moral Decay|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=February 9, 2001|season=3|number=12A}}</ref> personal hygiene,<ref>{{cite episode|title=Down 'n' Dirty|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=September 10, 1999|season=2|number=5B}}</ref> going to school, [[Nocturnal enuresis|bed wetting]],<ref>{{cite episode|title=Pee Pee G's|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=November 13, 2003|season=5|number=6A}}</ref> or dependence on a [[security blanket]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Cover Up|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=May 26, 2000|season=2|number=11B}}</ref> Episodes often contain hidden references to older pop culture (especially noticeable in the episode \"Meet the Beat Alls\",<ref>{{cite episode|title=Meet the Beat-Alls|series=The Powerpuff Girls|network=Cartoon Network|date=February 9, 2001|season=3|number=12B}}</ref> which is a homage to [[the Beatles]]).

Buttercup, she is the toughest fighter.''\n* Blossom (voiced by [[Cathy Cavadini]]) is the self-proclaimed leader of the Powerpuff Girls.

Her unique abilities include \"Ice Breath\" (develops in \"Ice Sore\"), microscopic vision, and advanced intelligence; she is also a master strategist and apt planner.\n* Bubbles (voiced by [[Tara Strong]], credited as [[Tara Strong|Tara Charendoff]], in the series and by [[Kath Soucie]] in the What a Cartoon! episodes) is the \"softest and sweetest\" of the three.<ref name=\"CN\"/> Her signature color is blue, her personality ingredient is \"sugar\", and she has blonde hair in pigtails.

Her best friend is a stuffed octopus doll she calls \"Octi\", and she also loves animals. She exhibits the ability to both understand multiple languages and communicate with various animals, and her unique power is emitting supersonic waves.\n* Buttercup (voiced by [[E. G. Daily]]) is described as a \"tough hotheaded tomboy\".<ref name=\"CN\"/> Her personality ingredient is \"spice\", her signature color is green, and she has black hair in a flip.

This meant the launch of Radial Point's (formerly Zero Knowledge) suite of [[antivirus]], [[Firewall (networking)|firewall]] and [[spyware|anti-spyware]] services.  Although a fee was originally required, this is no longer the case, as Bell now provides the service at no extra charge for DSL customers.

Standard DSL customers must rent Bell's 2Wire 2701HG-G device, which can create [[IEEE 802.11g-2003|802.11g]] wireless access point.

This legacy technology uses a [[telephone modem]] to provide Internet access.\n\n=== Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) ===\nBell's [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) services are based on [[ADSL]], [[ADSL2+]] and [[VDSL2]] technology. The main differences in both equipments vary from the speed of signal, its length and its ability to overcome the noise of a phone line.  Except for very few grandfathered customers, Bell has monthly data transfer limits for all of their tiered Internet services.  Both downloads and uploads count towards the limit.  The following Bell Internet services are only available in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], and availability varies by region.  Fibe services can only be used where [[Fiber to the x|fibre-to-the-neighbourhood]] (FTTN) technology is deployed.  This currently includes urban [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Toronto]] as well as most major cities around GTA. Non-FTTN regions offer two plans: Bell Internet and Bell Internet Plus.\n\nBell has simplified its DSL lineup to offer only two traditional plans and five FTTN plans.\n\n===Fibre To The Home (FTTH)===\n[[Bell Fibe TV|Bell Fibe]]  Internet (FTTH) services are offered by Bell in select regions of Ontario and Quebec. Bell guarantees that the FTTH download and upload speeds advertised will be delivered to the Bell equipment.  Bell Fibe Internet is offered at the following speeds: 25/25 Mbit/s, 50/50 Mbit/s, 150/150 Mbit/s, 500/500 Mbit/s, 1 Gbit/s/750 Mbit/s, and 1.5 Gbit/s/940 Mbit/s.<ref>[http://www.bell.ca/Bell_Internet/Internet_access \"Fibe Internet Plans\"]</ref>\n\n[[Bell Aliant]] offers a similar but different [[Fibe (Bell Aliant)|Fibe]] service under the same branding to certain areas in [[Atlantic Canada]].\n\n=== Dry DSL ===\n[[Naked DSL]], commonly known as dry DSL in Canada, consists of a DSL service without a traditional home phone service.\nBell does not charge any additional fees for dry DSL service; previously, there was a charge of $4 per month.  Bell charges resellers a monthly fee ranging from $7.25 to $25.10 and a one-time activation fee for dry DSL service.  Although Bell still attributes a phone number to a dry DSL line, it cannot be used for phone calls.  When one attempts to call a dry DSL phone number, they receive the following message: \"The number you are calling cannot receive incoming calls.  This is a recording.  Le poste que vous appelez ne peut recevoir d'appels.  C'\u00e9tait un message enregistr\u00e9.\"\n\n=== McAfee Security ===\nSince April 11, 2013, Bell offers [[McAfee]] Security on all of its current Internet plans.\n\n=== Add-ons ===\nThese are services offered by Bell Internet in addition to DSL or FTTH services, either for free or at additional costs:\n* ''PC Care'', an optional computer [[technical support]] service with a monthly fee.\n* ''Usage Insurance'', which increases the monthly bandwidth cap with one or multiple blocks of 25GB, or provides unlimited Internet usage for a fee.\n* ''Unlimited Internet Usage''\n* ''Wireless Home Networking''\n\n===Legacy services===\n{{See also|Inukshuk Wireless|inMusic}}\nBell previously offered Portable Internet and Rural Internet services in select rural regions, similarly to what [[Rogers Communications]] offered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bell.ca/Bell_Internet/Products/Portable_3_Mbps|title=Bell Internet|work=bell.ca|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101161822/http://www.bell.ca/Bell_Internet/Products/Portable_3_Mbps|archivedate=2011-11-01}}</ref>  These services used the [[Inukshuk Wireless]] network.

It was only available in some parts of the GTA (Greater Toronto Area).  Customers can now add any DSL Internet plan to their Fibe TV service.  Despite being an [[IPTV]] service, Bell does not charge usage-based billing for Bell Fibe TV.\n\n''Personal Vault'' was a [[backup]] service, available nationwide both for customers and non-customers.\n\nWhile [[inMusic]] remains available as a music news portal, both the [[online music store]] and subscription service were discontinued.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Companies}}\n*[[Bell Canada]]\n*[[Cogeco]]\n*[[Net Neutrality]]\n*[[Rogers Internet]]\n*[[TekSavvy]]\n*[[List of internet service providers in Canada]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://www.bell.ca/Bell_Internet}}\n*[http://support.bell.ca/Internet Bell Internet Support]\n*[http://www.dslreports.com/reviews/412 Bell Sympatico review by dslreports.com (cited in many sites)]\n*[http://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca/programmes/prof_profilnew.asp?comrcid=404 Provincial protection agency report (Section in French)]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Bell Canada}}\n{{Bell Media}}\n{{Canadian ISP}}\n\n[[Category:Bell Canada]]\n[[Category:Internet service providers of Canada]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|Bell Internet services offered in major urban centres of Ontario and Quebec|High Speed Internet in Atlantic Canada|Bell Aliant High Speed Internet|the communications company|Bell Canada|the Fiber IPTV services|Bell Fibe TV}}\n{{Primary sources|date=November 2011}}\n\n{{Infobox company\n| name = Bell Internet\n| logo =  Bell logo.svg\n| type = [[Subsidiary]]\n| key_people =\n| industry = [[Internet service provider]]\n| products = [[xDSL]]<br/> [[FTTH]]<br/> [[Dial-up access|Dial-up]]\n| revenue =\n| num_employees =\n| parent = [[BCE Inc.]]\n| foundation = November 29, 1995\n| location = [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada\n| homepage =[https://www.bell.ca/Bell_Internet bell.ca/internet]\n}}\n\n'''Bell Internet''', originally and frequently still called '''Sympatico''', is the [[residential]] [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) division of [[BCE Inc.]] As of May 3, 2012, Bell Internet had over 3 million subscribers in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], making it the largest ISP in Canada.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1990s: Early years ===\n[[File:Logo - Bell Sympatico.png|thumb|Bell Internet's former logo as Bell Sympatico]]\nSympatico was launched on November 29, 1995.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Originally a national service operated jointly by Canada's [[incumbent local exchange carrier]]s and operational run as a content portal by [[MediaLinx]] , the companies other than Bell<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bell.ca|title=Mobile phones, TV, Internet and Home phone service - Bell Canada|work=bell.ca}}</ref> (including [[Aliant]]) have since retreated to their own brands.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\n=== 2000s: Value-added services and rebranding ===\nStarting in Summer 2003, Sympatico tried to differentiate its service from its competitors by adding [[value-added service]]s.

Non-FTTN regions offer two plans: Bell Internet and Bell Internet Plus.\n\nBell has simplified its DSL lineup to offer only two traditional plans and five FTTN plans.\n\n===Fibre To The Home (FTTH)===\n[[Bell Fibe TV|Bell Fibe]]  Internet (FTTH) services are offered by Bell in select regions of Ontario and Quebec. Bell guarantees that the FTTH download and upload speeds advertised will be delivered to the Bell equipment.  Bell Fibe Internet is offered at the following speeds: 25/25 Mbit/s, 50/50 Mbit/s, 150/150 Mbit/s, 500/500 Mbit/s, 1 Gbit/s/750 Mbit/s, and 1.5 Gbit/s/940 Mbit/s.<ref>[http://www.bell.ca/Bell_Internet/Internet_access \"Fibe Internet Plans\"]</ref>\n\n[[Bell Aliant]] offers a similar but different [[Fibe (Bell Aliant)|Fibe]] service under the same branding to certain areas in [[Atlantic Canada]].\n\n=== Dry DSL ===\n[[Naked DSL]], commonly known as dry DSL in Canada, consists of a DSL service without a traditional home phone service.\nBell does not charge any additional fees for dry DSL service; previously, there was a charge of $4 per month.  Bell charges resellers a monthly fee ranging from $7.25 to $25.10 and a one-time activation fee for dry DSL service.  Although Bell still attributes a phone number to a dry DSL line, it cannot be used for phone calls.  When one attempts to call a dry DSL phone number, they receive the following message: \"The number you are calling cannot receive incoming calls.  This is a recording.  Le poste que vous appelez ne peut recevoir d'appels.  C'\u00e9tait un message enregistr\u00e9.\"\n\n=== McAfee Security ===\nSince April 11, 2013, Bell offers [[McAfee]] Security on all of its current Internet plans.\n\n=== Add-ons ===\nThese are services offered by Bell Internet in addition to DSL or FTTH services, either for free or at additional costs:\n* ''PC Care'', an optional computer [[technical support]] service with a monthly fee.\n* ''Usage Insurance'', which increases the monthly bandwidth cap with one or multiple blocks of 25GB, or provides unlimited Internet usage for a fee.\n* ''Unlimited Internet Usage''\n* ''Wireless Home Networking''\n\n===Legacy services===\n{{See also|Inukshuk Wireless|inMusic}}\nBell previously offered Portable Internet and Rural Internet services in select rural regions, similarly to what [[Rogers Communications]] offered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bell.ca/Bell_Internet/Products/Portable_3_Mbps|title=Bell Internet|work=bell.ca|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101161822/http://www.bell.ca/Bell_Internet/Products/Portable_3_Mbps|archivedate=2011-11-01}}</ref>  These services used the [[Inukshuk Wireless]] network.  Bell is discontinuing these offerings.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}  Customers are encouraged to use [[Bell Mobility]] Internet services instead, which generally offer a much lower bandwidth cap.\n\nBell Entertainment was a bundle offer which included [[Bell Fibe TV]] service and 25 Mbit/s \"Fibe\" DSL. It was only available in some parts of the GTA (Greater Toronto Area).  Customers can now add any DSL Internet plan to their Fibe TV service.  Despite being an [[IPTV]] service, Bell does not charge usage-based billing for Bell Fibe TV.\n\n''Personal Vault'' was a [[backup]] service, available nationwide both for customers and non-customers.\n\nWhile [[inMusic]] remains available as a music news portal, both the [[online music store]] and subscription service were discontinued.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Companies}}\n*[[Bell Canada]]\n*[[Cogeco]]\n*[[Net Neutrality]]\n*[[Rogers Internet]]\n*[[TekSavvy]]\n*[[List of internet service providers in Canada]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://www.bell.ca/Bell_Internet}}\n*[http://support.bell.ca/Internet Bell Internet Support]\n*[http://www.dslreports.com/reviews/412 Bell Sympatico review by dslreports.com (cited in many sites)]\n*[http://www.opc.gouv.qc.ca/programmes/prof_profilnew.asp?comrcid=404 Provincial protection agency report (Section in French)]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Bell Canada}}\n{{Bell Media}}\n{{Canadian ISP}}\n\n[[Category:Bell Canada]]\n[[Category:Internet service providers of Canada]]\n", "name_user": "Dondervogel 2", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e2010s: Lower caps and faster speeds:dubious", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Internet"}

The team  matched on a 5\u201311 season in 1988, in which finished winning two of their last three games including an upset of the 1988 AFC East Champion [[1988 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] (a win that was not only Tampa Bay's high point of the season, but turned out to be hugely impactful on the AFC playoff picture, as Buffalo's loss combined with an overtime win by [[1988 Cincinnati Bengals season|the Cincinnati Bengals]] over Washington in the season finale meant that the Bengals clinched the home-field advantage that would have otherwise gone to the Bills; Cincinnati ended up winning a close AFC title game at home against Buffalo and got to [[Super Bowl XXIII]].

The Bucs extended their record to 3\u20132 by beating the hated [[1989 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] finally in Tampa Stadium, holding off the Bears to a 42\u201335 victory. It was an impressive win, but then the Bucs lost to the [[Detroit Lions]] in the last minute and entered into an overall five-game losing-streak tailspin. Tampa Bay would sweep Chicago to end the streak (an achievement which was diluted by the Bears having their worst season in several years) but ended with a disappointing 5\u201311 record.

The team  matched on a 5\u201311 season in 1988, in which finished winning two of their last three games including an upset of the 1988 AFC East Champion [[1988 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] (a win that was not only Tampa Bay's high point of the season, but turned out to be hugely impactful on the AFC playoff picture, as Buffalo's loss combined with an overtime win by [[1988 Cincinnati Bengals season|the Cincinnati Bengals]] over Washington in the season finale meant that the Bengals clinched the home-field advantage that would have otherwise gone to the Bills; Cincinnati ended up winning a close AFC title game at home against Buffalo and got to [[Super Bowl XXIII]]. The season started with a road win against the improved [[1989 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]], and game two brought the Super Bowl champion [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] and [[Joe Montana]] to [[Tampa Stadium]]. With Joe trying to direct a 4th quarter comeback, cornerback [[Ricky Reynolds]] dropped what would have been a game ending interception on second down in the end zone. On third down, Montana rolled out and ran untouched into the endzone for a winning TD that left a rare sellout crowd stunned and silent in defeat. The Bucs extended their record to 3\u20132 by beating the hated [[1989 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] finally in Tampa Stadium, holding off the Bears to a 42\u201335 victory. It was an impressive win, but then the Bucs lost to the [[Detroit Lions]] in the last minute and entered into an overall five-game losing-streak tailspin. Tampa Bay would sweep Chicago to end the streak (an achievement which was diluted by the Bears having their worst season in several years) but ended with a disappointing 5\u201311 record. [[James Wilder Sr.]]\u2019s final season was highlighted by a 100-yard receiving game in week 9.

The thick grasslands of wetlands are also grazing grounds for a large number of cattle and horses during the summer months that helps the growth of the tender bamboo shoots on which the cranes feed later during the winter season. There were suggestions that the wetlands be drained and used to grow cash crops such as potatoes, which is also the main crop of the valley. Such an action would have deprived the cranes of their main feeding centres.<ref name=saving>{{Cite web |url=http://www.savingcranes.org/blackneckedcranefestivalbhutan.html |title=Black-necked Crane Festival, Bhutan |accessdate=20 August 2010 |publisher=International Crane Foundation |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126031045/http://www.savingcranes.org/blackneckedcranefestivalbhutan.html |archivedate=26 November 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> However, Palje \"Benjie\" Dorji, former Chief Justice of Bhutan, former Minister for Environment and uncle of the present King of Bhutan, as the Chairman of the Royal Bhutan Society and as founder of the Black-necked Conservation Programme prevailed on the Government of Bhutan to drop the proposal to drain the wetlands of the Phobjika Valley to create farms to grow cash rich seed potatoes.<ref name=Train/><ref name=\"Palin, p.146-148\">Palin, pp. 146\u2013148</ref>\n\nThis crane species is legally protected in Bhutan and its hunting is prohibited. The religious culture of the [[Buddhists]] has attracted the cranes closer to the religious communities of [[Lama]]s, particularly in the Phobjikha and Khotokha valleys. Another reason for this is that when the large number of cranes visit these valleys, which are snow bound, the village community, including the Buddhist Lamas migrate to warmer regions to [[Wangdue Phodrong]], thus avoiding a human conflict with the cranes' habitat, which forage in the valleys in marshy lands that are ploughed before winter and that provide insects and plant material and seeds. In these habitats, it is inferred, that livestock also helps by grazing on grass which in turn helps in bamboo regeneration on which the cranes feed.<ref name=birds/>\n\nAnother feature noted in Bhutan is the belief among the common people that they are blessed when cranes circle around their valleys. A particular practice observed is that they plant the winter [[wheat]] only after the cranes arrive in their valleys to roost.<ref name=saving/> Bhutanese people sing folk songs as the cranes arrive in Bhutan and also dance in the autumn. They call it as ''thrung thrung karmo.''<ref name=Brown/> The religious significance of these cranes is further accentuated in Bhutan by the report that \"they mate for life and ...live for 30 or 40 years\".<ref name=\"Palin, p.148\">Palin, p. 148</ref>\n\n==Population==\nPhobjika valley has recorded the maximum number of cranes in Bhutan for several years. Other places in Bhutan where the cranes have been sighted in small numbers are: Bumdeling, Lhuntshi District, Thangmachu, Thangby-Kharsa, [[Tashi Yangtse]], [[Punakha|Punakha Valley]], [[Bumthang Valley]], Jakhar Valley, [[Samtengang]], [[Gyetsa]], Khatekha Valley, [[Gogona]] and [[Wangdue Phodrang|Wangdi]]. However, the Phobjika Valley is one of the two important wintering grounds, where a special protection centre has been established to protect these birds.<ref name=birds/> The number of cranes reported here was 120 in 1986/87. It rose to 219 in November 2000 and is quoted as 270 now.<ref name=birds/><ref name=\"Palin, p.147\">Palin, p. 147</ref>\nHowever, its numbers, reported worldwide, is very large (initially it was mentioned as 800 till they found them in very large numbers in China), with a total world population of about 11,000 individuals (mature individuals about 8,800) in the wild, mostly in China including [[Tibet Automous Region|Tibet]], about 500 in Bhutan and small numbers at two valleys in [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in India,<ref>Choudhury, A.U. (2000). The Black-necked Crane in Arunachal Pradesh. ''The Twilight'' 2(2 & 3):31-32.</ref><ref>Choudhury, A.U. (2008). In the valley of cranes. ''Sanctuary Asia'' 28(5): 78-80.</ref> and a small number in [[Vietnam]] also. There are indications that their number is increasing due to conservation efforts which may eventually result in downgrading its vulnerability to threat to a lower category.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=\"Palin, p.148\"/>\n\n==Threats==\nIts habitats in Bhutan, mainly the wetlands, were getting degraded due to agriculture and anthropogenic pressures on its breeding and wintering grounds, causing its numbers to decline, as also in other parts of the world, and was thus declared under the Vulnerable category (C1).<ref name=birds/> The 2006 flood event in Bhutan is said to have affected substantially the crane's roosting habitat in [[Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary]].<ref name=\"Brown, p.196\">Brown, p. 196</ref> Increasing number of tourists could be a threat in future unless there is proper regulation.<ref>Choudhury, A.U. (2009). The crane valleys of India and Bhutan. ''Environ'' 10 (2): 10-15.</ref>\n\n==Conservation measures==\n{{off topic|date=March 2018}}\nThe conservation measures undertaken in Bhutan to preserve and conserve the cranes are unique; in fact more and more crane habitat areas are being brought under the protected area concept. The [[Royal Society for Protection of Nature, Bhutan|Royal Society for Protection of Nature]] (RSPN) established in 1987, which has the mandate for conservation and nature education has been involved in monitoring the winter visitors to the Phobjika valley and other habitats such as Bomdeling Valley. According to recorded information, 141 cranes visit Bomdeling valley (Phobjika reports a count of about 400 now) every year. RSPN has a Visitor Centre at the Phobjikha Valley, which provides information on cranes and the environment of the valley. The information Centre is a very modern [[decagon]]al building, next to a stream, with high-tech equipment. There is an observatory for birdwatchers, a mini theatre with mural painting with narration. The center staff provides services such as narration, facilitation and presentation of the valley and cranes in Bhutan. The Society has also produced a documentary (1989 : On the wings of prayer and 2014: Heavenly Bird with a German TV company) film on the cranes visiting Bhutan every year. Further, in Phubjika the Observation Towers have been so located that they cause the least disturbance to the crane habitats. Tourists are allowed to observe the cranes through the two or three high tech \u201cspotting telescopes\u2019\u2019 and spotted on the watch the behaviour of the crane as described in the RSPN pamphlet titled \u201cField Guide to Crane Behaviour\u201d, from a safe distance under the strict supervision of forest officials. Farmers are also advised to replace the barbed wire fencing with wooden and stone fencing to reduce harm to the cranes.<ref name=birds/><ref name=\"Palin, p.148\"/><ref name=\"Brown, pp. 153, 196\">Brown, pp. 153, 196</ref> Collisions with powerlines cause mortality to many crane species and when electricity was to be provided to the valley, the power cables were laid underground to avoid any mortality. The work was taken up during summer when the birds do not use the area.<ref>http://www.entwicklung.at/news/electrifying_phobjikha/en/</ref>\n\nCrane population counts are conducted during the winter by the RSPN, the Sherubtse College and the Nature and Trekking Club. A Nature Reserve Centre has also been established at Kibethang, near the Phobjikha wintering grounds with funding provided by [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and USA.<ref name=birds/> Although Bhutan's wintering cranes are secure to a great extent, the habitat loss such as in Bumthang and Paro due to development and human settlement chould be a major conservation issue in future.<ref>Choudhury, A.U. (2006). Some new and interesting birds records from Bhutan. ''Indian Birds'' 3 (2): 51\u201353.</ref>\n\n==Festival==\nA black-necked crane festival is held every year in the premises of the [[Gangteng Monastery]] on 11 November to welcome the cranes, which start arriving in late October. The festival is attended by a large number of local people. On this occasion, children wearing crane costumes perform choreographed crane dances. During this period, cranes are seen flying at high altitudes over the mountains.<ref name=Buckley/><ref name=saving/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park]]\n* [[Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary]]\n* [[Black-necked crane]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Cite book|last=Palin|first=Michael|title=Himalaya|publisher=Penguin|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7538-1990-6}}\n* [https://photos.axelebert.net/en/black-necked-cranes-bhutan.html Black-necked Cranes in Phobjikha - Images and Videos]\n\n[[Category:Birds of Bhutan| ]]\n[[Category:Birds of South Asia| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n[[File:GrusNigricollisBlyth.jpg|thumb|right|[[Black-necked crane]], ''Grus nigricollis'' ]]\n'''[[Black-necked crane]]s in [[Bhutan]]''' (''Grus nigricollis'') are winter visitors during late October to mid February to the [[Phobjikha Valley]] as well as [[Ladakh]], [[India]], and [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[India]].

The thick grasslands of wetlands are also grazing grounds for a large number of cattle and horses during the summer months that helps the growth of the tender bamboo shoots on which the cranes feed later during the winter season. There were suggestions that the wetlands be drained and used to grow cash crops such as potatoes, which is also the main crop of the valley. Such an action would have deprived the cranes of their main feeding centres.<ref name=saving>{{Cite web |url=http://www.savingcranes.org/blackneckedcranefestivalbhutan.html |title=Black-necked Crane Festival, Bhutan |accessdate=20 August 2010 |publisher=International Crane Foundation |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126031045/http://www.savingcranes.org/blackneckedcranefestivalbhutan.html |archivedate=26 November 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> However, Palje \"Benjie\" Dorji, former Chief Justice of Bhutan, former Minister for Environment and uncle of the present King of Bhutan, as the Chairman of the Royal Bhutan Society and as founder of the Black-necked Conservation Programme prevailed on the Government of Bhutan to drop the proposal to drain the wetlands of the Phobjika Valley to create farms to grow cash rich seed potatoes.<ref name=Train/><ref name=\"Palin, p.146-148\">Palin, pp. 146\u2013148</ref>\n\nThis crane species is legally protected in Bhutan and its hunting is prohibited. The religious culture of the [[Buddhists]] has attracted the cranes closer to the religious communities of [[Lama]]s, particularly in the Phobjikha and Khotokha valleys. Another reason for this is that when the large number of cranes visit these valleys, which are snow bound, the village community, including the Buddhist Lamas migrate to warmer regions to [[Wangdue Phodrong]], thus avoiding a human conflict with the cranes' habitat, which forage in the valleys in marshy lands that are ploughed before winter and that provide insects and plant material and seeds. In these habitats, it is inferred, that livestock also helps by grazing on grass which in turn helps in bamboo regeneration on which the cranes feed.<ref name=birds/>\n\nAnother feature noted in Bhutan is the belief among the common people that they are blessed when cranes circle around their valleys. A particular practice observed is that they plant the winter [[wheat]] only after the cranes arrive in their valleys to roost.<ref name=saving/> Bhutanese people sing folk songs as the cranes arrive in Bhutan and also dance in the autumn. They call it as ''thrung thrung karmo.''<ref name=Brown/> The religious significance of these cranes is further accentuated in Bhutan by the report that \"they mate for life and ...live for 30 or 40 years\".<ref name=\"Palin, p.148\">Palin, p. 148</ref>\n\n==Population==\nPhobjika valley has recorded the maximum number of cranes in Bhutan for several years. Other places in Bhutan where the cranes have been sighted in small numbers are: Bumdeling, Lhuntshi District, Thangmachu, Thangby-Kharsa, [[Tashi Yangtse]], [[Punakha|Punakha Valley]], [[Bumthang Valley]], Jakhar Valley, [[Samtengang]], [[Gyetsa]], Khatekha Valley, [[Gogona]] and [[Wangdue Phodrang|Wangdi]]. However, the Phobjika Valley is one of the two important wintering grounds, where a special protection centre has been established to protect these birds.<ref name=birds/> The number of cranes reported here was 120 in 1986/87. It rose to 219 in November 2000 and is quoted as 270 now.<ref name=birds/><ref name=\"Palin, p.147\">Palin, p. 147</ref>\nHowever, its numbers, reported worldwide, is very large (initially it was mentioned as 800 till they found them in very large numbers in China), with a total world population of about 11,000 individuals (mature individuals about 8,800) in the wild, mostly in China including [[Tibet Automous Region|Tibet]], about 500 in Bhutan and small numbers at two valleys in [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in India,<ref>Choudhury, A.U. (2000). The Black-necked Crane in Arunachal Pradesh. ''The Twilight'' 2(2 & 3):31-32.</ref><ref>Choudhury, A.U. (2008). In the valley of cranes. ''Sanctuary Asia'' 28(5): 78-80.</ref> and a small number in [[Vietnam]] also. There are indications that their number is increasing due to conservation efforts which may eventually result in downgrading its vulnerability to threat to a lower category.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=\"Palin, p.148\"/>\n\n==Threats==\nIts habitats in Bhutan, mainly the wetlands, were getting degraded due to agriculture and anthropogenic pressures on its breeding and wintering grounds, causing its numbers to decline, as also in other parts of the world, and was thus declared under the Vulnerable category (C1).<ref name=birds/> The 2006 flood event in Bhutan is said to have affected substantially the crane's roosting habitat in [[Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary]].<ref name=\"Brown, p.196\">Brown, p. 196</ref> Increasing number of tourists could be a threat in future unless there is proper regulation.<ref>Choudhury, A.U. (2009). The crane valleys of India and Bhutan. ''Environ'' 10 (2): 10-15.</ref>\n\n==Conservation measures==\n{{off topic|date=March 2018}}\nThe conservation measures undertaken in Bhutan to preserve and conserve the cranes are unique; in fact more and more crane habitat areas are being brought under the protected area concept. The [[Royal Society for Protection of Nature, Bhutan|Royal Society for Protection of Nature]] (RSPN) established in 1987, which has the mandate for conservation and nature education has been involved in monitoring the winter visitors to the Phobjika valley and other habitats such as Bomdeling Valley. According to recorded information, 141 cranes visit Bomdeling valley (Phobjika reports a count of about 400 now) every year. RSPN has a Visitor Centre at the Phobjikha Valley, which provides information on cranes and the environment of the valley. The information Centre is a very modern [[decagon]]al building, next to a stream, with high-tech equipment. There is an observatory for birdwatchers, a mini theatre with mural painting with narration. The center staff provides services such as narration, facilitation and presentation of the valley and cranes in Bhutan. The Society has also produced a documentary (1989 : On the wings of prayer and 2014: Heavenly Bird with a German TV company) film on the cranes visiting Bhutan every year. Further, in Phubjika the Observation Towers have been so located that they cause the least disturbance to the crane habitats. Tourists are allowed to observe the cranes through the two or three high tech \u201cspotting telescopes\u2019\u2019 and spotted on the watch the behaviour of the crane as described in the RSPN pamphlet titled \u201cField Guide to Crane Behaviour\u201d, from a safe distance under the strict supervision of forest officials. Farmers are also advised to replace the barbed wire fencing with wooden and stone fencing to reduce harm to the cranes.<ref name=birds/><ref name=\"Palin, p.148\"/><ref name=\"Brown, pp. 153, 196\">Brown, pp. 153, 196</ref> Collisions with powerlines cause mortality to many crane species and when electricity was to be provided to the valley, the power cables were laid underground to avoid any mortality. The work was taken up during summer when the birds do not use the area.<ref>http://www.entwicklung.at/news/electrifying_phobjikha/en/</ref>\n\nCrane population counts are conducted during the winter by the RSPN, the Sherubtse College and the Nature and Trekking Club. A Nature Reserve Centre has also been established at Kibethang, near the Phobjikha wintering grounds with funding provided by [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and USA.<ref name=birds/> Although Bhutan's wintering cranes are secure to a great extent, the habitat loss such as in Bumthang and Paro due to development and human settlement chould be a major conservation issue in future.<ref>Choudhury, A.U. (2006). Some new and interesting birds records from Bhutan. ''Indian Birds'' 3 (2): 51\u201353.</ref>\n\n==Festival==\nA black-necked crane festival is held every year in the premises of the [[Gangteng Monastery]] on 11 November to welcome the cranes, which start arriving in late October. The festival is attended by a large number of local people. On this occasion, children wearing crane costumes perform choreographed crane dances. During this period, cranes are seen flying at high altitudes over the mountains.<ref name=Buckley/><ref name=saving/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park]]\n* [[Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary]]\n* [[Black-necked crane]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Cite book|last=Palin|first=Michael|title=Himalaya|publisher=Penguin|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7538-1990-6}}\n* [http://photos.axelebert.org/en/black-necked-cranes-bhutan.html Black-necked Cranes in Phobjikha - Images and Videos]\n\n[[Category:Birds of Bhutan| ]]\n[[Category:Birds of South Asia| ]]\n", "name_user": "Aaxxll", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-necked_cranes_in_Bhutan"}

The penalty for manslaughter is normally less than the penalty for murder. The two broad categories of manslaughter are:<ref name=\"mlawmanslaughter\" /><ref name=\"elhomicide\" />\n* '''[[Voluntary manslaughter]]''': the intentional, unpremeditated killing of another person as the result of a disturbed state of mind, or ''heat of passion''.\n* '''Involuntary manslaughter''': the unintentional killing of another person through an act of recklessness that shows indifference to the lives and safety of others, or an act of negligence that could reasonably be foreseen to result in death. The act that results in death may be intentional, such as pushing somebody in anger, but their death (such as by their subsequently falling, striking their head, and suffering a lethal head injury) is not.\n\nAnother form of manslaughter in some jurisdictions is '''constructive manslaughter''', which may be charged in the event that a person causes a death without intention, but as the result of violating an important safety law or regulation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Slapper |first1 = Gary |title = Corporate Manslaughter: an Examination of the Determinants of Prosecutorial Polic |journal = Social & Legal Studies |date = 1 December 1993 |volume = 2 |issue = 4 |pages = 423\u2013443 |doi = 10.1177/096466399300200404 |url = http://oro.open.ac.uk/20975/2/1535A240.pdf }}</ref><ref>e.d. fatal accidents with alpinists [https://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1999/09/09/condamnation-de-deux-alpinistes-pour-homicide-involontaire_3575132_1819218.html ''Condamnation de deux alpinistes pour \u00ab homicide involontaire \u00bb''] [https://www.ledauphine.com/haute-savoie/2015/12/11/l-avocat-du-syndicat-des-guides-derape-sur-l-arete-du-gouter ''L\u2019avocat du syndicat des guides d\u00e9rape sur l\u2019ar\u00eate du Go\u00fbter'']</ref>\n\n=== Defenses to homicide ===\n\nNot all homicides are crimes, or subject to criminal prosecution.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Stevens |first1 = T.L. |title = Manslaughter and Negligent Homicide |journal = Judge Advocate General Journal |date = February 1957 |volume = 1957 |url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/naval1957&div=13&id=&page= |accessdate = 11 September 2017 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171208013627/http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals%2Fnaval1957&div=13&id=&page= |archivedate = 8 December 2017 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Some are legally privileged, meaning that they are not criminal acts at all. Others may occur under circumstances that provide the defendant with a full or partial defense to criminal prosecution. Common defenses include:\n\n* '''[[Right of self-defense|Self-defense]]''': while most homicides by civilians are criminally prosecutable, a [[right of self-defense]] (often including the right to defend others)<ref>See, e.g., California Constitution, Art. 1, Sec. 1</ref> is widely recognized, including, in dire circumstances, the use of deadly force.<ref>See, e.g., California Penal Code, Sec. 197.</ref>\n* '''[[Insanity defense|Mental incapacity]]''': A defendant may attempt to prove that they are not criminally responsible for a homicide due to a mental disorder.  In some jurisdictions, mentally incompetent killers may be [[involuntary commitment|involuntarily committed]] in lieu of criminal trial. Mental health and development are often taken into account during sentencing.  For example, in the United States, the death penalty cannot be applied to convicted murderers with intellectual disabilities.<ref>See the U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]''.</ref>\nif the defendant in a capital case is sufficiently mentally disabled in the United States they cannot be executed. Instead, the individual is placed under the category of \"[[insane]]\".\n* '''[[Defense of infancy]]''' \u2013 Small children are not held criminally liable before the age of criminal responsibility.  A [[juvenile court]] may handle defendants above this age but below the legal [[age of majority]], though because homicide is a serious crime some older minors are charged in an adult justice system.  Age is sometimes also taken into account during sentencing even if the perpetrator is old enough to have criminal responsibility.\n* '''[[Justifiable homicide]]''' or '''privilege''': Due to the circumstances, although a homicide occurs, the act of killing is not unlawful. For example, a killing on the battlefield during war is normally lawful, or a police officer may shoot a dangerous suspect in order to protect the officer's own life or the lives and safety of others.\n\nThe availability of defenses to a criminal charge following a homicide may affect the homicide rate. For example, it has been suggested that the availability of \"[[Stand-your-ground law|stand your ground]]\" defense has resulted in an increase in the homicide rate in U.S. jurisdictions that recognize the defense,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vedantam|first1=Shankar|title='Stand Your Ground' Linked To Increase In Homicides|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/02/167984117/-stand-your-ground-linked-to-increase-in-homicide|website=All Things Considered|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=25 January 2018|date=2 January 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126012809/https://www.npr.org/2013/01/02/167984117/-stand-your-ground-linked-to-increase-in-homicide|archivedate=26 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> including Florida.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Sanburn|first1=Josh|title=Florida's 'Stand Your Ground' Law Linked to Homicide Increase|url=http://time.com/4569145/florida-stand-your-ground-law-homicide-increase-study/|accessdate=25 January 2018|magazine=Time|date=14 November 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323223358/http://time.com/4569145/florida-stand-your-ground-law-homicide-increase-study/|archivedate=23 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=Cheng|last2=Hoekstra|first2=Mark|title=Does Strengthening Self-Defense Law Deter Crime or Escalate Violence?

Some medium- and large-scale mass killings by state actors have been term [[massacre]]s, though not all such killings have been so named. The term \"[[democide]]\" has been coined by [[Rudolph Rummel]] to describe \"murder by government\" in general, which includes both extrajudicial killings and widespread systematic homicide.\n\nKilling by government might be called \"murder\" or \"mass murder\" in general usage, especially if seen by the commentator as unethical, but the domestic legal definitions of murder, manslaughter, etc., usually exclude killings carried out by lawful government action.\n\n===Examples of widespread systematic government killing===\n\nDeliberate massacres of captives or civilians during [[war]]time or periods of [[civil unrest]] by the state's military forces include those committed by [[Genghis Khan]], the [[Golden Horde]], the troops of [[Vlad the Impaler]], the British Empire in its colonies, the [[Empire of Japan]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[World War II]], [[The Holocaust]], the [[Nanjing Massacre]], the [[Katyn Forest Massacre]] of [[Poles|Polish]] citizens in 1940 and the [[NKVD prisoner massacres|massacres of political prisoners]] after the launch of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the [[Three Alls Policy]], the massacre of [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union#The Holocaust|Soviet Jews]] at [[Babi Yar]], the mass murder of the [[Hungarians|Hungarian]], [[Serbs|Serbian]] and [[Germans|German]] population in [[Vojvodina]] in the [[Communist purges in Serbia in 1944\u201345|\"Vengeance of Bacska]]\", the murder of 24 unarmed villagers by British troops in the [[Batang Kali massacre]] during the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u201366|mass killings in Indonesia]] during [[Suharto]]'s rise to power,<ref>Mark Aarons (2007). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=dg0hWswKgTIC&lpg=PA80&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q&f=false Justice Betrayed: Post-1945 Responses to Genocide].\" In David A.

Typically, small groups of people would battle their neighbors using the farm tools at hand, such as knives, sickles, hammers, and axes. Mayhem and death were deliberate. The vast majority of Europeans lived in rural areas as late as 1800. Cities were few, and small in size, but their concentration of population was conducive to violence and their trends resembled those in rural areas<ref name=eisner>Manuel Eisner, \"Long-term historical trends in violent crime.\" ''Crime and Justice'' 30 (2003): 83-142.

From approximately 1200 AD through 1800 AD, homicide rates from violent local episodes, not including military actions, declined by a factor of ten, from approximately 32 deaths per 1000 people to 3.2 per 1000. In the 20th century the homicide rate fell to 1.4 per 1000. Police forces seldom existed outside the cities; prisons only became common after 1800.  Before then harsh penalties were imposed for homicide (severe whipping or execution) but they proved ineffective at controlling or reducing the insults to honor that precipitated most of the violence.<ref>On the growing role of local government in reducing local feuds see Matthew H.

Others may occur under circumstances that provide the defendant with a full or partial defense to criminal prosecution. Common defenses include:\n\n* '''[[Right of self-defense|Self-defense]]''': while most homicides by civilians are criminally prosecutable, a [[right of self-defense]] (often including the right to defend others)<ref>See, e.g., California Constitution, Art. 1, Sec. 1</ref> is widely recognized, including, in dire circumstances, the use of deadly force.<ref>See, e.g., California Penal Code, Sec. 197.</ref>\n* '''[[Insanity defense|Mental incapacity]]''': A defendant may attempt to prove that they are not criminally responsible for a homicide due to a mental disorder.  In some jurisdictions, mentally incompetent killers may be [[involuntary commitment|involuntarily committed]] in lieu of criminal trial. Mental health and development are often taken into account during sentencing.  For example, in the United States, the death penalty cannot be applied to convicted murderers with intellectual disabilities.<ref>See the U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]''.</ref>\nif the defendant in a capital case is sufficiently mentally disabled in the United States they cannot be executed. Instead, the individual is placed under the category of \"[[insane]]\".\n* '''[[Defense of infancy]]''' \u2013 Small children are not held criminally liable before the age of criminal responsibility.  A [[juvenile court]] may handle defendants above this age but below the legal [[age of majority]], though because homicide is a serious crime some older minors are charged in an adult justice system.  Age is sometimes also taken into account during sentencing even if the perpetrator is old enough to have criminal responsibility.\n* '''[[Justifiable homicide]]''' or '''privilege''': Due to the circumstances, although a homicide occurs, the act of killing is not unlawful. For example, a killing on the battlefield during war is normally lawful, or a police officer may shoot a dangerous suspect in order to protect the officer's own life or the lives and safety of others.\n\nThe availability of defenses to a criminal charge following a homicide may affect the homicide rate. For example, it has been suggested that the availability of \"[[Stand-your-ground law|stand your ground]]\" defense has resulted in an increase in the homicide rate in U.S. jurisdictions that recognize the defense,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vedantam|first1=Shankar|title='Stand Your Ground' Linked To Increase In Homicides|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/02/167984117/-stand-your-ground-linked-to-increase-in-homicide|website=All Things Considered|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=25 January 2018|date=2 January 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126012809/https://www.npr.org/2013/01/02/167984117/-stand-your-ground-linked-to-increase-in-homicide|archivedate=26 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> including Florida.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Sanburn|first1=Josh|title=Florida's 'Stand Your Ground' Law Linked to Homicide Increase|url=http://time.com/4569145/florida-stand-your-ground-law-homicide-increase-study/|accessdate=25 January 2018|magazine=Time|date=14 November 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323223358/http://time.com/4569145/florida-stand-your-ground-law-homicide-increase-study/|archivedate=23 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=Cheng|last2=Hoekstra|first2=Mark|title=Does Strengthening Self-Defense Law Deter Crime or Escalate Violence?

The vast majority of Europeans lived in rural areas as late as 1800.

From approximately 1200 AD through 1800 AD, homicide rates from violent local episodes, not including military actions, declined by a factor of ten, from approximately 32 deaths per 1000 people to 3.2 per 1000. In the 20th century the homicide rate fell to 1.4 per 1000. Police forces seldom existed outside the cities; prisons only became common after 1800.  Before then harsh penalties were imposed for homicide (severe whipping or execution) but they proved ineffective at controlling or reducing the insults to honor that precipitated most of the violence.<ref>On the growing role of local government in reducing local feuds see Matthew H.

Retrieved on 2009-08-13.</ref> The novel tells of a wealthy young man, '''Godfrey Morgan''' who, with his deportment instructor, Professor T. Artelett, embark from [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]] on a round-the-world ocean voyage. They are [[Castaway|cast away]] on an uninhabited Pacific island where they must endure a series of adversities. Later they encounter an [[African slave]], Carefinotu, brought to the island by [[cannibals]].  In the end, the trio manage to work together and survive on the island.\n\nThe novel is a [[robinsonade]]\u2014a play on [[Daniel Defoe]]'s [[1719 in literature|1719]] novel ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe narrative begins with the auction by the [[Federal government of the United States|US Government]] of fictional Spencer Island, located 460 miles off the California coast ({{coord|32|15|N|145|18|W}}).  The island is uninhabited and there are only two bidders, William W. Kolderup, a very wealthy San Franciscan, and his arch-rival J. R. Taskinar, a resident of [[Stockton, California]].  Kolderup wins the auction, buying Spencer Island for four million dollars.  J. R. Taskinar mutters, \"I will be avenged!\" before retiring to his hotel.\n\nGodfrey, an idle twenty-two-year-old, lives with Kolderup, his uncle, and Kolderup's adopted goddaughter, Phina, whom Godfrey has grown to love. Prior to marrying Phina, Godfrey asks to undertake a world tour. Acceding to his desire, his uncle sends Godfrey on a sea voyage around the world on board one of his [[steamship]]s, the ''Dream'', commanded by Captain Turcott.  Godfrey is accompanied by his mentor, teacher, and dance instructor, Professor T. Artelett aka \"Tartlet\".\n\nAfter some time at sea, Godfrey is awakened one foggy night and told to abandon ship as the ''Dream'' is [[Shipwreck (accident)#Causes|founder]]ing.  After jumping into the sea, Godfrey is washed ashore on a deserted island, where he soon finds Tartlet has also been [[maroon]]ed. Godfrey, with scant help from Tartlet, will have to learn to survive, to organize his life, face hostile intruders, and overcome other obstacles. Eventually, they are also joined by Carefinotu, whom Godfrey rescues from [[Polynesians]] visiting the island. By the end of the story the formerly jaded young man has discovered the value of independent effort, and he gains poise and courage.  The marooned group are rescued and returned to San Francisco, where Godfrey is reunited with Phina.

Artelett]], embark from [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]] on a round-the-world ocean voyage. They are [[Castaway|cast away]] on an uninhabited Pacific island where they must endure a series of adversities. Later they encounter an [[African slave]], Carefinotu, brought to the island by [[cannibals]].  In the end, the trio manage to work together and survive on the island.\n\nThe novel is a [[robinsonade]]\u2014a play on [[Daniel Defoe]]'s [[1719 in literature|1719]] novel ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe narrative begins with the auction by the [[Federal government of the United States|US Government]] of fictional Spencer Island, located 460 miles off the California coast ({{coord|32|15|N|145|18|W}}).  The island is uninhabited and there are only two bidders, William W. Kolderup, a very wealthy San Franciscan, and his arch-rival J. R. Taskinar, a resident of [[Stockton, California]].  Kolderup wins the auction, buying Spencer Island for four million dollars.  J. R. Taskinar mutters, \"I will be avenged!\" before retiring to his hotel.\n\nGodfrey, an idle twenty-two-year-old, lives with Kolderup, his uncle, and Kolderup's adopted goddaughter, Phina, whom Godfrey has grown to love. Prior to marrying Phina, Godfrey asks to undertake a world tour. Acceding to his desire, his uncle sends Godfrey on a sea voyage around the world on board one of his [[steamship]]s, the ''Dream'', commanded by Captain Turcott.  Godfrey is accompanied by his mentor, teacher, and dance instructor, Professor T. Artelett aka \"Tartlet\".\n\nAfter some time at sea, Godfrey is awakened one foggy night and told to abandon ship as the ''Dream'' is [[Shipwreck (accident)#Causes|founder]]ing.  After jumping into the sea, Godfrey is washed ashore on a deserted island, where he soon finds Tartlet has also been [[maroon]]ed. Godfrey, with scant help from Tartlet, will have to learn to survive, to organize his life, face hostile intruders, and overcome other [[obstacles]]. Eventually, they are also joined by Carefinotu, whom Godfrey rescues from [[Polynesians]] visiting the island. By the end of the story the formerly jaded young man has discovered the value of independent effort, and he gains poise and courage.  The marooned group are rescued and returned to San Francisco, where Godfrey is reunited with [[Phina]]. They agree to marry before continuing the world tour, this time together.\n\n==Theme==\nAlthough the setting is different, the [[robinsonade]] plot is a variation on the theme of rational self-sufficiency that Verne developed earlier in ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1874).

It is generally accepted as 1875, although a few sources give it as 1880. According to British author [[Robert Lacey]]'s book ''The Kingdom'', a leading Saudi historian found records that show Ibn Saud in 1891 greeting an important tribal delegation. The historian reasoned that a nine or ten-year-old child (as given by the 1880 birth date) would have been too young to be allowed to greet such a delegation, while an adolescent of 15 or 16 (as given by the 1875 date) would likely have been allowed. When Lacey interviewed one of Ibn Saud's sons{{Which|date=November 2010}} prior to writing the book, the son recalled that his father often laughed at records showing his birth date to be 1880.

He was a charismatic leader and kept his men supplied with arms. Over the next two years, he and his forces recaptured almost half of the Najd from the Rashidis.\n\nIn 1904, [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Mutib|Abdulaziz]] of [[Rashidi dynasty#Amirs of the House of Rasheed|Al Rashid]] (a.k.a. Ibn Rashid) appealed to the [[Ottoman Empire]] for military protection and assistance. The Ottomans responded by sending troops into Arabia. On 15 June 1904, Ibn Saud's forces suffered a major defeat at the hands of the combined Ottoman and Rashidi forces. His forces regrouped and began to wage [[guerrilla warfare]] against the Ottomans. Over the next two years, he was able to disrupt their supply routes, forcing them to retreat. The victory of Ibn Saud in [[Battle of Rawdat Muhanna (1906)|Rawdat Muhanna]], in which Ibn Rashid died, ended the Ottoman presence in [[Najd]] and [[Al-Qassim Region|Qassim]] by the end of October 1906.\n \nHe completed his conquest of the Najd and the eastern coast of Arabia in 1912. He then founded the [[Ikhwan]], a military-religious brotherhood, which was to assist in his later conquests, with the approval of local [[Salafi]] [[ulema]]. In the same year, he instituted an [[agrarian policy]] to settle the [[nomadic pastoralism|nomadic pastoralist]] [[Bedouins]] into colonies and to replace their tribal organizations with allegiance to the Ikhwan.\n\nDuring World War I, the [[British government]] established diplomatic relations with Ibn Saud. The British agent, Captain [[William Shakespear (explorer)|William Shakespear]], was well received by the Bedouin.<ref>Robert Wilson and Zahra Freeth. ''The Arab of the Desert''. London: Allen & Unwin, 1983. pp. 312\u201313. Print.</ref> Similar diplomatic missions were established with any Arabian power who might have been able to unify and stabilize the region. The British entered into the [[Treaty of Darin]] in December 1915, which made the lands of the House of Saud a British protectorate and attempted to define the boundaries of the developing Saudi state.<ref>Wilkinson, John C. ''Arabia's Frontiers: the Story of Britain's Boundary Drawing in the Desert''. London u.a.: Tauris, 1993. pp. 133\u201339.

E. Lawrence]] (a.k.a. Lawrence of Arabia) to him in 1915. The Saudi Ikhwan began to conflict with [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein, Sharif of Mecca]] also in 1917, just as his sons [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]] and [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]] entered [[Damascus]]. The Treaty of Darin remained in effect until superseded by the [[Jeddah]] conference of 1927 and the [[Dammam]] conference of 1952, during both of which Ibn Saud extended his boundaries past the Anglo-Ottoman Blue Line. After Darin, he stockpiled the weapons and supplies which the British provided him, including a 'tribute' of \u00a35,000 per month.<ref name=sindi>{{cite web|author=Abdullah Mohammad Sind|title=The Direct Instruments of Western Control over the Arabs: The Shining Example of the House of Saud|url=http://www.social-sciences-and-humanities.com/PDF/house_of_saud.pdf|work=Social Sciences|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref> After [[World War I]], he received further support from the British, including a glut of surplus munitions. He launched his campaign against the Al Rashidi in 1920; by 1922 they had been all but destroyed.\n\nThe defeat of the Al Rashidi doubled the size of Saudi territory because, after the war of Ha'il, Ibn Saud sent his army to occupy Al-Jouf and the army led by [[Eqab bin Mohaya]],{{clarify|date=February 2017|reason=What is the army of Eqab bin Mohaya doing exactly?}} the head of Talhah tribe.

In exchange, Ibn Saud agreed to recognize British territories in the area, particularly along the Persian Gulf coast and in Iraq. The former of these were vital to the British, as merchant traffic between [[British India]] and the United Kingdom depended upon coaling stations on the approach to the [[Suez Canal]].\n\nIn 1925, Ibn Saud's forces captured the holy city of Mecca from [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sharif Hussein]], ending 700 years of [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] rule.

For the next five years, Ibn Saud administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units.\n\nWith international recognition and support, Ibn Saud continued to consolidate his power. By 1927, his forces had overrun most of the central [[Arabian Peninsula]], but the alliance between the Ikhwan and the [[House of Saud|Al Saud]] collapsed when Ibn Saud forbade further raiding. The few portions of central Arabia that had not been overrun by the Saudi-Ikhwan forces had treaties with London, and Ibn Saud was sober enough to see the folly of provoking the British by pushing into these areas. This did not sit well with the Ikhwan, who had been taught that all non-Wahhabis were infidels. Tensions finally boiled over when the [[Ikhwan Revolt|Ikhwan rebelled]]. After two years of fighting, they were suppressed by Ibn Saud in the [[Battle of Sabilla]] in March 1929.\n\nOn 23 September 1932, Ibn Saud formally united his realm into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with himself as its [[King of Saudi Arabia|king]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Odah Sultan|title=Saudi\u2013American Relations 1968\u201378: A study in ambiguity|url=http://usir.salford.ac.uk/14829/1/D083068.pdf|publisher=Salford University|accessdate=23 April 2012|year=1988}}</ref> He transferred his court to [[Murabba Palace]] from the [[Masmak fort|Masmak Fort]] in 1938<ref name=simbacom>{{cite web|title=Murabba Palace Historical Centre|url=http://www.simbacom.com/riyadh-ksa/historic/murabba.html|work=Simbacom|accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> and the palace remained his residence and the seat of government until his death in 1953.<ref name=semag1999>{{cite journal|title=Rebirth of a historic center|journal=Saudi Embassy Magazine|date=Spring 1999|url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/files/PDF/Publications/Magazine/1999-Spring/rebirth.htm|access-date=22 July 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807161001/http://www.saudiembassy.net/files/PDF/Publications/Magazine/1999-Spring/rebirth.htm|archive-date=7 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIbn Saud had to first eliminate the right of his own father in order to rule, and then distance and contain the ambitions of his five brothers, particularly his oldest brother, Muhammad, who had fought with him during the battles and conquests that gave birth to the state.<ref name=mai>{{cite journal|author=Mai Yamani|title=From fragility to stability: a survival strategy for the Saudi monarchy|journal=Contemporary Arab Affairs|date=January\u2013March 2009|volume=2|issue=1|pages=90\u2013105|doi=10.1080/17550910802576114|url=http://www.maiyamani.com/pdf/From%20Fragility%20to%20stability.pdf|access-date=5 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916085529/http://www.maiyamani.com/pdf/From%20Fragility%20to%20stability.pdf|archive-date=16 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Oil discovery  and his rule==\n[[File:Harry St. John Bridger Philby.jpg|thumb|220px|St. John Philby]]\n[[Petroleum]] was discovered in Saudi Arabia in 1938 by American geologists working for Standard Oil Company of New York (SOCONY) in partnership with Saudi officials.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Through his advisers [[St John Philby]] and [[Ameen Rihani]], Ibn Saud granted substantial authority over Saudi oil fields to American oil companies in 1944, much to the dismay of the British who had invested heavily in the House of Saud's rise to power in hopes of open access to any oil reserves that were to be surveyed. Beginning in 1915, he signed the \"friendship and cooperation\" pact with Britain to keep his militia in line and cease any further attacks against their protectorates for whom they were responsible.\n\nHis newfound oil wealth brought with it a great deal of power and influence that Ibn Saud would use to advantage in the Hijaz. He forced many nomadic tribes to settle down and abandon \"petty wars\" and vendettas. He also began widespread enforcement of the new kingdom's ideology, based on the teachings of [[Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab]]. This included an end to traditionally sanctioned rites of pilgrimage, recognized by the orthodox schools of jurisprudence, but at odds with those sanctioned by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. In 1926, after a caravan of Egyptians on the way to Mecca were beaten by his forces for playing bugles, he was impelled to issue a conciliatory statement to the Egyptian government. In fact, several such statements were issued to Muslim governments around the world as a result of beatings suffered by the [[pilgrim]]s visiting the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} With the uprising and subsequent decimation thereafter of the [[Ikhwan]] in 1929 via British air power, the 1930s marked a turning point. With his rivals eliminated, Ibn Saud's ideology was in full force, ending nearly 1400 years of accepted religious practices surrounding the [[Hajj]], the majority of which were sanctioned by a millennium of scholarship.\n\nIbn Saud established a Shura Council of the [[Hijaz]] as early as 1927. This Council was later expanded to 20 members, and was chaired by the king's son, [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Anthony H.

It was completed in 1951 and was used commercially after the king's death. It enabled Riyadh to grow into a relatively modern city. But when a paved road was built in 1962, the railway lost its traffic.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Michel G.

According to some sources, he had twenty-two consorts. Many of his marriages were contracted in order to cement alliances with other clans, during the period when the Saudi state was founded and stabilized. Abdul Aziz was the father of almost a hundred children, including [[List of sons of King Abdulaziz ibn Saud by seniority|forty-five sons]].\n\nHe was a tall man standing between 1.93 m (6&nbsp;ft 4 in)<ref>[[David Lamb (journalist)|David Lamb]], ''The Arabs : Journeys Beyond the Mirage'', Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group (2011), p.265</ref><ref>Kenneth Williams, ''Ibn Sa\u02bbud : the puritan king of Arabia'', J.

From a young age, she ingrained in him a strong sense of family destiny and motivated him to regain the lost glory of the House of Saud. During the years when the Saud family were living almost as refugees in [[Kuwait]], Jawhara bint Faisal frequently recounted the deeds of his ancestors to Abdulaziz and exhorted him not to be content with the existing situation. She was instrumental in making him decide to return to Najd from Kuwait and regain the territories of his family. She was well educated in Islam, in Arab custom and in tribal and clan relationships. She remained among the king's most trusted and influential advisors all her life. Ibn Saud asked her about the experiences of past rulers and the historical allegiance and the roles of tribes and individuals. Jawhara was also deeply respected by the king's children. Ibn Saud visited her daily until she died around 1930.<ref name=stig>{{cite journal|author=Stig Stenslie|title=Power behind the Veil: Princesses of House of Saud |journal=Journal of Arabian Studies: Arabia, the Gulf, and the Red Sea|year=2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=69\u201379|doi=10.1080/21534764.2011.576050}}</ref>\n\nIbn Saud was also very close to his sister [[Noura bint Abdul Rahman Al Saud|Noura]], who was one year older than him.

He had many quarrels with his elder brother Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman as to who should be appointed heir. Muhammad wanted his son Khalid to be designated the heir. His eldest son was [[Turki I bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Turki Al Awwal]], who was the Crown Prince of the Kingdoms of Nejd and Hejaz, but Turki died at age 18, predeceasing his father, and his younger full-brother was appointed Crown Prince. Had Turki not died, he would have been the Crown Prince. Ibn Saud had 45 sons, of whom 36 survived to adulthood. Ten of his sons were capable enough to be candidates for the succession. They were [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|Saud]], [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]], [[Muhammad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Muhammad]], [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|Khalid]], [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd]], [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]], [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Sultan]], [[Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Nayef]], [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|Salman]] and [[Muqrin bin Abdulaziz|Muqrin]]. Of these ten, six became king. Muhammad, Sultan, Nayef and Muqrin were crown prince but never succeeded the throne. Muhammad resigned from the post, Sultan and Nayef predeceased King Abdullah, and Muqrin was removed from the post by his brother King Salman in April 2015.\n\n==Views==\nIn regard to essential values for the state and people, he said, \"Two things are essential to our state and our people&nbsp;... religion and the rights inherited from our fathers.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Joseph Nevo|title=Religion and National Identity in Saudi Arabia|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=July 1998|volume=34|issue=3|pages=34\u201353|jstor=4283951|doi=10.1080/00263209808701231}}</ref>\n\nAmani Hamdan argues that the attitude of Ibn Saud towards women's education was encouraging since he expressed his support in a conversation with [[St John Philby]] in which he stated, \"It is permissible for women to read.\"<ref name=amani>{{cite journal|author=Amani Hamdan|title=Women and education in Saudi Arabia: Challenges and achievements|journal=International Education Journal|year=2005|volume=6|issue=1|pages=42\u201364|url=http://ehlt.flinders.edu.au/education/iej/articles/v6n1/hamdan/paper.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nHis last words to his two sons, the future King Saud and the next in line Prince Faisal, who were already battling each other, were \"You are brothers, unite!\"<ref name=mai/> Shortly before his death, Ibn Saud stated, \"Verily, my children and my possessions are my enemies.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Steffen Hertog|title=Shaping the Saudi state: Human agency's shifting role in the rentier state formation|url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/4561/1/4561.pdf?DDD35+dgi4lh|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|year=2007|volume=39|issue=4|pages=539\u2013563|doi=10.1017/S0020743807071073|accessdate=17 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Death and funeral==\nIn October 1953, Ibn Saud was seriously ill due to heart disease.<ref name=twa10nov>{{cite news|title=Warrior King Ibn Saud Dies at 73|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52939653|accessdate=2 April 2013|newspaper=The West Australian|date=10 November 1953}}</ref> He died in his sleep of a heart attack at the palace of [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Prince Faisal]] in Ta'if on 9 November 1953 (2 Rab\u012b\u02bf al-Awwal 1373 AH) at the age of 78.<ref name=kingsofk/><ref name=htoday>{{cite journal|author=Richard Cavendish|title=Death of Ibn Saud|journal=History Today|year=2003|volume=53|issue=11|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/death-ibn-saud|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=KIAS>{{cite web|title=Ibn Saud dies|url=http://sacmclubs.org/king_abdulaziz/mainns/3800.htm|publisher=King Abdulaziz Information Source|access-date=9 August 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014124034/http://sacmclubs.org/king_abdulaziz/mainns/3800.htm|archive-date=14 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Prince Faisal was at his side.<ref name=KIAS/> Funeral prayer was performed at Al Hawiya in Ta'if.<ref name=kingsofk/> His body was brought to Riyadh where he was buried in [[Al Oud cemetery]].<ref name=kingsofk/><ref name=gnews11>{{cite news|author=Abdul Nabi Shaheen|title=Sultan will have simple burial at Al Oud cemetery|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/sultan-will-have-simple-burial-at-al-oud-cemetery-1.916706|accessdate=29 July 2012|newspaper=Gulf News|date=23 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe US Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] stated after Ibn Saud's death that he would be remembered for his achievements as a statesman.<ref name=canberra>{{cite news|title=Western tributes to King Ibn Saud|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2898821|accessdate=11 April 2013|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=11 November 1953|location=London|page=5}}</ref>\n\n==Honors==\nIbn Saud was appointed an honorary Knight Grand Commander of the [[Order of the Indian Empire]] (GCIE) on 1 January 1920.<ref name=\"India_Burma_Office\">{{cite book|pages=107|title=The India Office and Burma Office List: 1947|first= |last=|publisher=HM Stationery Office|year=1947|ISBN=|subject=}}</ref> He was awarded the British [[Order of the Bath]] (GCB) in 1935,<ref>{{cite book|author=Sa\u00efd K.

It is generally accepted as 1875, although a few sources give it as 1880. According to British author [[Robert Lacey]]'s book ''The Kingdom'', a leading Saudi historian found records that show Ibn Saud in 1891 greeting an important tribal delegation. The historian reasoned that a nine or ten-year-old child (as given by the 1880 birth date) would have been too young to be allowed to greet such a delegation, while an adolescent of 15 or 16 (as given by the 1875 date) would likely have been allowed. When Lacey interviewed one of Ibn Saud's sons{{Which|date=November 2010}} prior to writing the book, the son recalled that his father often laughed at records showing his birth date to be 1880.

He was a charismatic leader and kept his men supplied with arms. Over the next two years, he and his forces recaptured almost half of the Najd from the Rashidis.\n\nIn 1904, [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Mutib|Abdulaziz]] of [[Rashidi dynasty#Amirs of the House of Rasheed|Al Rashid]] (a.k.a. Ibn Rashid) appealed to the [[Ottoman Empire]] for military protection and assistance. The Ottomans responded by sending troops into Arabia. On 15 June 1904, Ibn Saud's forces suffered a major defeat at the hands of the combined Ottoman and Rashidi forces. His forces regrouped and began to wage [[guerrilla warfare]] against the Ottomans. Over the next two years, he was able to disrupt their supply routes, forcing them to retreat. The victory of Ibn Saud in [[Battle of Rawdat Muhanna (1906)|Rawdat Muhanna]], in which Ibn Rashid died, ended the Ottoman presence in [[Najd]] and [[Al-Qassim Region|Qassim]] by the end of October 1906.\n \nHe completed his conquest of the Najd and the eastern coast of Arabia in 1912. He then founded the [[Ikhwan]], a military-religious brotherhood, which was to assist in his later conquests, with the approval of local [[Salafi]] [[ulema]]. In the same year, he instituted an [[agrarian policy]] to settle the [[nomadic pastoralism|nomadic pastoralist]] [[Bedouins]] into colonies and to replace their tribal organizations with allegiance to the Ikhwan.\n\nDuring World War I, the [[British government]] established diplomatic relations with Ibn Saud. The British agent, Captain [[William Shakespear (explorer)|William Shakespear]], was well received by the Bedouin.<ref>Robert Wilson and Zahra Freeth. ''The Arab of the Desert''. London: Allen & Unwin, 1983. pp. 312\u201313. Print.</ref> Similar diplomatic missions were established with any Arabian power who might have been able to unify and stabilize the region. The British entered into the [[Treaty of Darin]] in December 1915, which made the lands of the House of Saud a British protectorate and attempted to define the boundaries of the developing Saudi state.<ref>Wilkinson, John C. ''Arabia's Frontiers: the Story of Britain's Boundary Drawing in the Desert''. London u.a.: Tauris, 1993. pp. 133\u201339. Print</ref> In exchange, Ibn Saud pledged to again make war against Ibn Rashid, who was an ally of the Ottomans.\n\nThe British Foreign Office had previously begun to support [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sharif Hussein bin Ali]], Emir of the [[Hejaz]] by sending [[T. E. Lawrence]] (a.k.a. Lawrence of Arabia) to him in 1915. The Saudi Ikhwan began to conflict with [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein, Sharif of Mecca]] also in 1917, just as his sons [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]] and [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]] entered [[Damascus]]. The Treaty of Darin remained in effect until superseded by the [[Jeddah]] conference of 1927 and the [[Dammam]] conference of 1952, during both of which Ibn Saud extended his boundaries past the Anglo-Ottoman Blue Line. After Darin, he stockpiled the weapons and supplies which the British provided him, including a 'tribute' of \u00a35,000 per month.<ref name=sindi>{{cite web|author=Abdullah Mohammad Sind|title=The Direct Instruments of Western Control over the Arabs: The Shining Example of the House of Saud|url=http://www.social-sciences-and-humanities.com/PDF/house_of_saud.pdf|work=Social Sciences|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref> After [[World War I]], he received further support from the British, including a glut of surplus munitions. He launched his campaign against the Al Rashidi in 1920; by 1922 they had been all but destroyed.\n\nThe defeat of the Al Rashidi doubled the size of Saudi territory because, after the war of Ha'il, Ibn Saud sent his army to occupy Al-Jouf and the army led by [[Eqab bin Mohaya]],{{clarify|date=February 2017|reason=What is the army of Eqab bin Mohaya doing exactly?}} the head of Talhah tribe. This allowed Ibn Saud the leverage to negotiate a new and more favorable treaty with the British. Their treaty, signed at Uqair in 1922, where he met [[Percy Cox]], British High Commissioner in Iraq, to draw boundaries<ref>[http://www.ibnsaud.info/main/3101.htm Ibn Saud meets Sir Percy Cox in Uqair to draw boundaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108124401/http://www.ibnsaud.info/main/3101.htm |date=8 January 2016 }}</ref> saw Britain recognize many of his territorial gains. In exchange, Ibn Saud agreed to recognize British territories in the area, particularly along the Persian Gulf coast and in Iraq. The former of these were vital to the British, as merchant traffic between [[British India]] and the United Kingdom depended upon coaling stations on the approach to the [[Suez Canal]].\n\nIn 1925, Ibn Saud's forces captured the holy city of Mecca from [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sharif Hussein]], ending 700 years of [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] rule.

For the next five years, Ibn Saud administered the two parts of his dual kingdom as separate units.\n\nWith international recognition and support, Ibn Saud continued to consolidate his power. By 1927, his forces had overrun most of the central [[Arabian Peninsula]], but the alliance between the Ikhwan and the [[House of Saud|Al Saud]] collapsed when Ibn Saud forbade further raiding. The few portions of central Arabia that had not been overrun by the Saudi-Ikhwan forces had treaties with London, and Ibn Saud was sober enough to see the folly of provoking the British by pushing into these areas. This did not sit well with the Ikhwan, who had been taught that all non-Wahhabis were infidels. Tensions finally boiled over when the [[Ikhwan Revolt|Ikhwan rebelled]]. After two years of fighting, they were suppressed by Ibn Saud in the [[Battle of Sabilla]] in March 1929.\n\nOn 23 September 1932, Ibn Saud formally united his realm into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with himself as its [[King of Saudi Arabia|king]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Odah Sultan|title=Saudi\u2013American Relations 1968\u201378: A study in ambiguity|url=http://usir.salford.ac.uk/14829/1/D083068.pdf|publisher=Salford University|accessdate=23 April 2012|year=1988}}</ref> He transferred his court to [[Murabba Palace]] from the [[Masmak fort|Masmak Fort]] in 1938<ref name=simbacom>{{cite web|title=Murabba Palace Historical Centre|url=http://www.simbacom.com/riyadh-ksa/historic/murabba.html|work=Simbacom|accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> and the palace remained his residence and the seat of government until his death in 1953.<ref name=semag1999>{{cite journal|title=Rebirth of a historic center|journal=Saudi Embassy Magazine|date=Spring 1999|url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/files/PDF/Publications/Magazine/1999-Spring/rebirth.htm|access-date=22 July 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807161001/http://www.saudiembassy.net/files/PDF/Publications/Magazine/1999-Spring/rebirth.htm|archive-date=7 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIbn Saud had to first eliminate the right of his own father in order to rule, and then distance and contain the ambitions of his five brothers, particularly his oldest brother, Muhammad, who had fought with him during the battles and conquests that gave birth to the state.<ref name=mai>{{cite journal|author=Mai Yamani|title=From fragility to stability: a survival strategy for the Saudi monarchy|journal=Contemporary Arab Affairs|date=January\u2013March 2009|volume=2|issue=1|pages=90\u2013105|doi=10.1080/17550910802576114|url=http://www.maiyamani.com/pdf/From%20Fragility%20to%20stability.pdf|access-date=5 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916085529/http://www.maiyamani.com/pdf/From%20Fragility%20to%20stability.pdf|archive-date=16 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Oil discovery  and his rule==\n[[File:Harry St. John Bridger Philby.jpg|thumb|220px|St. John Philby]]\n[[Petroleum]] was discovered in Saudi Arabia in 1938 by American geologists working for Standard Oil Company of New York (SOCONY) in partnership with Saudi officials.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Through his advisers [[St John Philby]] and [[Ameen Rihani]], Ibn Saud granted substantial authority over Saudi oil fields to American oil companies in 1944, much to the dismay of the British who had invested heavily in the House of Saud's rise to power in hopes of open access to any oil reserves that were to be surveyed. Beginning in 1915, he signed the \"friendship and cooperation\" pact with Britain to keep his militia in line and cease any further attacks against their protectorates for whom they were responsible.\n\nHis newfound oil wealth brought with it a great deal of power and influence that Ibn Saud would use to advantage in the Hijaz. He forced many nomadic tribes to settle down and abandon \"petty wars\" and vendettas. He also began widespread enforcement of the new kingdom's ideology, based on the teachings of [[Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab]]. This included an end to traditionally sanctioned rites of pilgrimage, recognized by the orthodox schools of jurisprudence, but at odds with those sanctioned by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. In 1926, after a caravan of Egyptians on the way to Mecca were beaten by his forces for playing bugles, he was impelled to issue a conciliatory statement to the Egyptian government. In fact, several such statements were issued to Muslim governments around the world as a result of beatings suffered by the [[pilgrim]]s visiting the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} With the uprising and subsequent decimation thereafter of the [[Ikhwan]] in 1929 via British air power, the 1930s marked a turning point. With his rivals eliminated, Ibn Saud's ideology was in full force, ending nearly 1400 years of accepted religious practices surrounding the [[Hajj]], the majority of which were sanctioned by a millennium of scholarship.\n\nIbn Saud established a Shura Council of the [[Hijaz]] as early as 1927. This Council was later expanded to 20 members, and was chaired by the king's son, [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Anthony H.

It was completed in 1951 and was used commercially after the king's death. It enabled Riyadh to grow into a relatively modern city. But when a paved road was built in 1962, the railway lost its traffic.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Michel G.

According to some sources, he had twenty-two consorts. Many of his marriages were contracted in order to cement alliances with other clans, during the period when the Saudi state was founded and stabilized.

From a young age, she ingrained in him a strong sense of family destiny and motivated him to regain the lost glory of the House of Saud. During the years when the Saud family were living almost as refugees in [[Kuwait]], Jawhara bint Faisal frequently recounted the deeds of his ancestors to Abdulaziz and exhorted him not to be content with the existing situation. She was instrumental in making him decide to return to Najd from Kuwait and regain the territories of his family. She was well educated in Islam, in Arab custom and in tribal and clan relationships. She remained among the king's most trusted and influential advisors all her life. Ibn Saud asked her about the experiences of past rulers and the historical allegiance and the roles of tribes and individuals. Jawhara was also deeply respected by the king's children.

His eldest son was [[Turki I bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Turki Al Awwal]], who was the Crown Prince of the Kingdoms of Nejd and Hejaz, but Turki died at age 18, predeceasing his father, and his younger full-brother was appointed Crown Prince. Had Turki not died, he would have been the Crown Prince. Ibn Saud had 45 sons, of whom 36 survived to adulthood. Ten of his sons were capable enough to be candidates for the succession. They were [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|Saud]], [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]], [[Muhammad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Muhammad]], [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|Khalid]], [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd]], [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]], [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Sultan]], [[Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Nayef]], [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|Salman]] and [[Muqrin bin Abdulaziz|Muqrin]].
