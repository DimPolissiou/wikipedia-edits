Founded on 18 May 1882, the team originally played only [[Exhibition game|friendly matches]] until it entered the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in [[1885\u201386 in English football|1885\u201386]]. The club currently competes in the [[Premier League]], the first tier of [[Football in England|English football]]. Nicknamed \"the [[Bordeaux wine#\"Claret\" term|Clarets]]\", due to the dominant colour of the home shirts, Burnley was one of the twelve founding members of [[the Football League]] in [[1888\u201389 Football League|1888]]. The club's [[emblem]] is based on the town's crest, with a Latin [[motto]] ''Pretiumque et Causa Laboris'' (\"The Prize and the Cause of [Our] Labour\").\n\nBurnley has been [[List of English football champions|champions of England]] twice, in [[1920\u201321 Burnley F.C. season|1920\u201321]] and [[1959\u201360 Burnley F.C. season|1959\u201360]], has won the FA Cup once, in [[1914 FA Cup Final|1914]], and has won the [[FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] twice, in [[1960 FA Charity Shield|1960]] and [[1973 FA Charity Shield|1973]]. The club has been runners-up in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] (now the Premier League) twice, in [[1919\u201320 Football League|1919\u201320]] and [[1961\u201362 Football League|1961\u201362]], and has finished runners-up two times in the FA Cup, in [[1947 FA Cup Final|1947]] and [[1962 FA Cup Final|1962]]. The Clarets also reached the [[1960\u201361 European Cup|1961]] quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. Burnley is one of only five teams to have won all top four professional divisions of English football, along with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Sheffield United]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].\n\nBurnley has played home games at [[Turf Moor]] since 17 February 1883, after the club had moved from the original premises at Calder Vale. The club colours of claret and blue were adopted prior to the 1910\u201311 season in tribute to the dominant club of English football at the time, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Burnley has a long-standing rivalry with nearby club [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], with whom it contests the [[East Lancashire derby|East Lancashire Derby]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early years (1882\u20131912) ===\n[[File:Burnley FC 1890.png|thumb|One of the earliest photographed Burnley sides, with the [[Lancashire Senior Cup|Lancashire Cup]] in the middle of the photo|alt=A black and white image of a football team with a trophy in the middle]]\nOn 18 May 1882, members of '''Burnley Rovers Rugby Club''' gathered at the Bull Hotel in Burnley to vote for a shift from [[rugby union]] to [[association football]], since other sports clubs in the area had changed their codes to association football and more income could be generated by playing football.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Burnley FC On This Day: History, Facts & Figures from Every Day of the Year|last=Bird|first=Philip|publisher=Pitch Publishing Ltd|year=2018|isbn=978-1785314254}}</ref> A large majority voted in favour of change of sports.

Founded on 18 May 1882, the team originally played only [[Exhibition game|friendly matches]] until it entered the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in [[1885\u201386 in English football|1885\u201386]]. The club currently competes in the [[Premier League]], the first tier of [[Football in England|English football]]. Nicknamed \"the [[Bordeaux wine#\"Claret\" term|Clarets]]\", due to the dominant colour of the home shirts, Burnley was one of the twelve founding members of [[the Football League]] in [[1888\u201389 Football League|1888]]. The club's [[emblem]] is based on the town's crest, with a Latin [[motto]] ''Pretiumque et Causa Laboris'' (\"The Prize and the Cause of [Our] Labour\").\n\nBurnley has been [[List of English football champions|champions of England]] twice, in [[1920\u201321 Burnley F.C. season|1920\u201321]] and [[1959\u201360 Burnley F.C. season|1959\u201360]], has won the FA Cup once, in [[1914 FA Cup Final|1914]], and has won the [[FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] twice, in [[1960 FA Charity Shield|1960]] and [[1973 FA Charity Shield|1973]]. The club has been runners-up in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] (now the Premier League) twice, in [[1919\u201320 Football League|1919\u201320]] and [[1961\u201362 Football League|1961\u201362]], and has finished runners-up two times in the FA Cup, in [[1947 FA Cup Final|1947]] and [[1962 FA Cup Final|1962]]. The Clarets also reached the [[1960\u201361 European Cup|1961]] quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. Burnley is one of only five teams to have won all top four professional divisions of English football, along with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Sheffield United]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].\n\nBurnley has played home games at [[Turf Moor]] since 17 February 1883, after the club had moved from the original premises at Calder Vale. The club colours of claret and blue were adopted prior to the 1910\u201311 season in tribute to the dominant club of English football at the time, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Burnley has a long-standing rivalry with nearby club [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], with whom it contests the [[East Lancashire derby|East Lancashire Derby]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early years (1882\u20131912) ===\n[[File:Burnley FC 1890.png|thumb|One of the earliest photographed Burnley sides, with the [[Lancashire Senior Cup|Lancashire Cup]] in the middle of the photo|alt=A black and white image of a football team with a trophy in the middle]]\nOn 18 May 1882, members of '''Burnley Rovers Rugby Club''' gathered at the Bull Hotel in Burnley to vote for a shift from [[rugby union]] to [[association football]], since other sports clubs in the area had changed their codes to association football and more income could be generated by playing football.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Burnley FC On This Day: History, Facts & Figures from Every Day of the Year|last=Bird|first=Philip|publisher=Pitch Publishing Ltd|year=2018|isbn=978-1785314254}}</ref> A large majority voted in favour of change of sports. A short time later, the club secretary, George Waddington, met with his committee and put forward another proposal, to drop \"Rovers\" from the club's name, thereby \"adopting the psychological high ground over many other local clubs by carrying the name of the town\", which the committee members unanimously agreed on.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/2016/may/on-this-day-may-18/|title=On This Day: May 18|date=18 May 2016|work=Burnley Football Club|access-date=25 December 2017|url-status=live|language=en-gb}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 August, Burnley Football Club played its first-ever match as an association football club against local club Burnley Wanderers, winning 4\u20130.

Set on the [[colonized]] [[fictional planet]] of Theron in the [[future]], where an [[alien race]] led by Gaudy have [[invaded]] the [[human]]-controlled location, players assume the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) [[fighter pilot]] taking control of the SW475 [[List of fictional spacecraft#Space fighters|space fighter]] craft in a effort to counterattack the invaders.\n\nInitially launched for the arcades, the game was later [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ported]] to other [[microcomputer]] and [[Home video game console|console]] [[Video game#Platforms|platforms]] by various [[third-party developer]]s, with each one featuring several changes or additions compared to the original release.\n\n''Slap Fight'' proved to be popular for Toaplan among arcades players despite a low number of arcade boards manufactured in Japan, however it was met with mixed reception from [[video game magazines]] across western regions, specifically the home [[Video game conversion|conversion]]s. Although it never received a direct sequel, the game's ideas and weapon system were later inherited by both ''[[Truxton (video game)|Truxton]]'' and ''[[Grind Stormer]]'', with the latter being regarded as its [[spiritual successor]]. The rights to the title are currently owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Slap Fight (Alcon).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot.]]\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nIt takes its inspiration from ''[[Xevious]]'' (being a vertical scroller) and ''[[Gradius]]'' (from which it borrows its [[power-up]] system), and helps to establish Toaplan's trademark style.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\">''Slap Fight MD'' manual (Sega Mega Drive, JP)</ref><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/slap-fight-alcon/|title=Slap Fight / ALCON|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref name=\"SFss\">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/slap_fight.html|title=SLAP FIGHT|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja}}</ref> The game takes place in an Earth-type environment with metallic, land-based enemies; some are mobile armor and others are fortifications embedded in natural terrain.\n\nCertain enemies leave power-up stars upon destruction. Collecting these stars \"turns on\" an upgrade menu at the bottom of the screen and moves a lit cursor through the list of power-ups described below. If any power-up is lit, but a ship is lost before a power-up could be selected, the star is \"carried over\" and the Speed block is lit on the next life. Single hits to the unshielded main ship destroy it, and the player loses any accumulated upgrades including Speed. This can make successive lives difficult to keep in the heat of battle.\n\nThis game does not support [[continue (video gaming)|continue]]s with extra credits, and is believed to \"loop\" endlessly; that is, after the final boss, gameplay resumes at the beginning of the play map but at successively higher difficulty, with enemies shooting faster and more frequently. Also, the score stops increasing when it displays 9,999,990 points, which might be achieved as early as the 15th, 16th, or 17th loops ([http://replay.marpirc.net/r/slapfighb1 beginning of 17th verified via MAME]).\n\n=== Power-ups ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nPower-ups appearing on the upgrade menu are somewhat similar to those in ''Gradius'':\n\n* Speed (upgradeable five times cumulatively)\n* Side-Shot (rapid-fire assistant; remains with ship regardless of main weapon unless/until ship is destroyed)\n* Shot (short-range, rapid-fire)\n* Wing (accessory; increases both the width and the exposure of the craft; improves the power or speed of equipped weapon; upgradeable to three pairs; two external pairs can be used to absorb hits but the whole pair will be lost)\n* Bomb (short-range, slow fire, area effect)\n* Laser (long-range)\n* Homing Missile (releases up to sixteen guided missiles) \n* Shield (invulnerability; lasts approx. 25 seconds, or 3 hits, whichever comes first; ends with audible warning)\n\nThe major weapons affect the enemies and terrain differently. For example, certain enemy towers can only be destroyed with Laser or Homing Missile; other enemies are destroyed ''much faster'' with specific weapons to match. If Bomb or Homing Missile are equipped, certain bonus targets will appear, or parts of the landscape may be destroyed to reveal bonuses. If Laser is active, certain plants in the landscape can be shot repeatedly to 'grow' and earn extra points until they scroll off-screen.\nIt has been reported that a bug in the game enabled the player to obtain all power-ups, simply by allowing themselves to be killed by the first enemy appearing upon starting the game without touching the controls. If this occurred, the next time the player ship appears, it has all the power-ups equipped.[http://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?/topic/76529-best-trick-cheat-or-bug-in-an-arcade-game/page-2 Slap Fight bug]\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe plot summary of ''Slap Fight'' varies between each region and version.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/><ref name=\"ALCONflyer\">''Alcon'' arcade flyer (Taito, US)</ref> The game takes place in the year 2059 on another galaxy, mankind has colonized an alien planet called Theon after evacuating a previously colonized planet Orac.

However, Theon is now under attack by the same alien fleet, but the humans are ready.

America|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[1986 in video gaming|1986]] [[Shoot 'em up#Types|vertically scrolling shooter]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[video game]] originally developed by [[Toaplan]] and published by [[Taito]]. Set on the [[colonized]] [[fictional planet]] of Theron in the [[future]], where an [[alien race]] led by Gaudy have [[invaded]] the [[human]]-controlled location, players assume the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) [[fighter pilot]] taking control of the SW475 [[List of fictional spacecraft#Space fighters|space fighter]] craft in a effort to counterattack the invaders.\n\nInitially launched for the arcades, the game was later [[Porting#Porting in gaming|ported]] to other [[microcomputer]] and [[Home video game console|console]] [[Video game#Platforms|platforms]] by various [[third-party developer]]s, with each one featuring several changes or additions compared to the original release.\n\n''Slap Fight'' proved to be popular for Toaplan among arcades players despite a low number of arcade boards manufactured in Japan, however it was met with mixed reception from [[video game magazines]] across western regions, specifically the home [[Video game conversion|conversion]]s. Although it never received a direct sequel, the game's ideas and weapon system were later inherited by both ''[[Truxton (video game)|Truxton]]'' and ''[[Grind Stormer]]'', with the latter being regarded as its [[spiritual successor]]. The rights to the title are currently owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Yuge.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Slap Fight (Alcon).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot.]]\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nIt takes its inspiration from ''[[Xevious]]'' (being a vertical scroller) and ''[[Gradius]]'' (from which it borrows its [[power-up]] system), and helps to establish Toaplan's trademark style.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\">''Slap Fight MD'' manual (Sega Mega Drive, JP)</ref><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\">{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/slap-fight-alcon/|title=Slap Fight / ALCON|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|date=3 July 2011|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref name=\"SFss\">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/slap_fight.html|title=SLAP FIGHT|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja}}</ref> The game takes place in an Earth-type environment with metallic, land-based enemies; some are mobile armor and others are fortifications embedded in natural terrain.\n\nCertain enemies leave power-up stars upon destruction. Collecting these stars \"turns on\" an upgrade menu at the bottom of the screen and moves a lit cursor through the list of power-ups described below. If any power-up is lit, but a ship is lost before a power-up could be selected, the star is \"carried over\" and the Speed block is lit on the next life. Single hits to the unshielded main ship destroy it, and the player loses any accumulated upgrades including Speed. This can make successive lives difficult to keep in the heat of battle.\n\nThis game does not support [[continue (video gaming)|continue]]s with extra credits, and is believed to \"loop\" endlessly; that is, after the final boss, gameplay resumes at the beginning of the play map but at successively higher difficulty, with enemies shooting faster and more frequently. Also, the score stops increasing when it displays 9,999,990 points, which might be achieved as early as the 15th, 16th, or 17th loops ([http://replay.marpirc.net/r/slapfighb1 beginning of 17th verified via MAME]).\n\n=== Power-ups ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nPower-ups appearing on the upgrade menu are somewhat similar to those in ''Gradius'':\n\n* Speed (upgradeable five times cumulatively)\n* Side-Shot (rapid-fire assistant; remains with ship regardless of main weapon unless/until ship is destroyed)\n* Shot (short-range, rapid-fire)\n* Wing (accessory; increases both the width and the exposure of the craft; improves the power or speed of equipped weapon; upgradeable to three pairs; two external pairs can be used to absorb hits but the whole pair will be lost)\n* Bomb (short-range, slow fire, area effect)\n* Laser (long-range)\n* Homing Missile (releases up to sixteen guided missiles) \n* Shield (invulnerability; lasts approx. 25 seconds, or 3 hits, whichever comes first; ends with audible warning)\n\nThe major weapons affect the enemies and terrain differently. For example, certain enemy towers can only be destroyed with Laser or Homing Missile; other enemies are destroyed ''much faster'' with specific weapons to match. If Bomb or Homing Missile are equipped, certain bonus targets will appear, or parts of the landscape may be destroyed to reveal bonuses. If Laser is active, certain plants in the landscape can be shot repeatedly to 'grow' and earn extra points until they scroll off-screen.\nIt has been reported that a bug in the game enabled the player to obtain all power-ups, simply by allowing themselves to be killed by the first enemy appearing upon starting the game without touching the controls. If this occurred, the next time the player ship appears, it has all the power-ups equipped.[http://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?/topic/76529-best-trick-cheat-or-bug-in-an-arcade-game/page-2 Slap Fight bug]\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe plot summary of ''Slap Fight'' varies between each region and version.<ref name=\"SFMDmanual\"/><ref name=\"SFALCONhg101\"/><ref name=\"SFss\"/><ref name=\"ALCONflyer\">''Alcon'' arcade flyer (Taito, US)</ref> The game takes place in the year 2059 on another galaxy, mankind has colonized an alien planet called Theon after evacuating a previously colonized planet Orac. Five years ago, the colony on Orac was attacked by alien invaders and the war was so intense, the colonists were forced to leave. However, Theon is now under attack by the same alien fleet, but the humans are ready. The player assumes the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) fighter pilot in the SW475 space fighter craft to stop the invaders from taking over Theon.\n\n== Development ==\n=== Arcade version ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n<ref name=\"PSGv10\">{{cite magazine|last=Abeto|first=Kobatsu|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc|magazine=PSG|volume=10|publisher=FSG|date=September 1989|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531193430/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-psg/|date=2017-05-31}}).</ref><ref name=\"G49\">{{cite magazine|author=|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=49|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=September 1990|page=|lang=ja}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107033548/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-gamest/|date=2019-11-07}}).</ref><ref name=\"TSCa\">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 \u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30eb|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=14 November 2011|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021030143/https://sweeprecord.com/srin-1100/|archive-date=2019-10-21|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711134859/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicle/|date=2018-07-11}}).</ref><ref name=\"TSCb\">{{cite web|url=https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3 \u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30eb \u7279\u8a2d\u30da\u30fc\u30b8|work=SweepRecord|publisher=SuperSweep|date=27 October 2011|access-date=2020-04-24|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215231114/https://sweeprecord.com/toaplan-shooting-toku/|archive-date=2020-02-15|url-status=live}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002072400/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-chronicleqa/|date=2019-10-02}}).</ref><ref name=\"STGv4a\">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Y\u016bsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u7279\u96c6  - \u5143\u30fb\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u3000\u958b\u767a\u8005\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc: \u4e0a\u6751\u5efa\u4e5f|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=4|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=3 February 2012|pages=33-40|lang=ja|ISBN=978-4896373844}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-uemura1/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906023755/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-uemura1/|date=2019-09-06}}).</ref><ref name=\"STGv4b\">{{cite magazine|last1=Kiyoshi|first1=Tane|author2=hally (VORC)|last3=Y\u016bsaku|first3=Yamamoto|title=\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u7279\u96c6  - \u5143\u30fb\u6771\u4e9c\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u3000\u958b\u767a\u8005\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc: \u5f13\u524a\u96c5\u7a14|magazine=Shooting Gameside|volume=4|publisher=Micro Magazine|date=3 February 2012|pages=41-48|lang=ja|ISBN=978-4896373844}} ([http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-yuge1/ Translation] by Shmuplations. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906023744/http://shmuplations.com/toaplan-yuge1/|date=2019-09-06}}).</ref>\n\n=== Mega Drive version ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n<ref name=\"EuroGSFMD\">{{cite web|last=Massey|first=Tom|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-12-death-from-above-the-making-of-slap-fight-md|title=Death from Above: The making of Slap Fight MD - Mikito Ichikawa takes us behind the doors of a forgotten classic|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=[[Gamer Network]]|date=May 5, 2015|access-date=2019-11-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320144329/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-12-death-from-above-the-making-of-slap-fight-md|archive-date=20 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe game was [[porting|ported]] to many 8-bit [[home computer]]s in the European & North American markets.\n\n''Slap Fight MD'' itself is a new game mode featuring featured new levels, graphics, weapons, music, etc., plus a new \"smart bomb\" feature at the cost of Wing powerups.
