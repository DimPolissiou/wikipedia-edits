The color will fade or even melt, depending upon the energy absorption of the color, and the sheet will have to be replaced. In permanent installations and some theatrical uses, colored glass filters or [[dichroic filter]]s are used. The main drawbacks are additional expense and a more limited selection.\n\n== History ==\nIn [[Shakespeare]]an-era theater, [[red wine]] was used in a glass container as a light filter. In later days, colored water or [[silk]] was used to filter light in the theater. Later, a [[gelatin]] base became the material of choice. Gelatin gel was available at least until 1979. The name ''gel'' has continued to be used to the present day. Gelatin-based color media had no melting point, and the color was cast in the media as opposed to being coated on the surface, both important properties for color media. It would, however, [[charring|char]] at high temperatures and become brittle once heated, so it was impossible to handle once used in the lighting instrument.\n\nBy 1945 more heat-tolerant and self-extinguishing [[polyvinyl acetate|acetate]]-based through-dyed materials were being manufactured (marketed as Chromoid then Cinemoid by Strand Electric). In the U.S., Roscolene (acetate) was also developed to deal with these higher output light sources. Though cheaper, the acetate filters fell out of favor with professional organizations since they could not withstand the higher temperatures produced by the [[tungsten halogen lamp]]s that came into widespread use in the late 1960s. The acetate-based material was replaced by [[polycarbonates]] like Roscolar ([[mylar]] polycarbonate) and [[polyester]]-based filters. These materials have superior heat tolerance when compared to acetate-based gels. Many were transparent film with a surface coating. The first dyed polyester gels were introduced by Berkey Colortran in 1969 as Gelatran, the original deep-dyed polyester<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.derekleffew.com/gelhistory|title=Gel history|website=www.derekleffew.com|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref>. The Gelatran process is still used today to produce GAMColor (100% of the line) and Roscolux (about 30% of the line)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ca.rosco.com/en/product/gamcolorr|title=GAMcolor|website=ca.rosco.com|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref>. Other color manufacturers, such as [[Lee Filters]] and Apollo Design Technology, use a surface applied dye. (Roscolux is 70% polycarbonate and 30% deep-dyed polyester.)\n\nAlmost every color manufacturer today uses either polycarbonate or polyester to manufacture their gels. Even today's gels can burn out (to lighten in color starting in the center) easily, rendering them useless. To help combat this, high-temperature materials \u2013 polyester having the highest melting point of {{convert|480|F}} \u2013 can be used to help prolong the life in high-heat output lighting instruments. As instrument design improves, it has become a selling point on many lights to have as little heat radiating from the front of the fixture as possible to help prevent burn-through, and help keep the stage and actors cooler during performances.\n\n[[File:MotorisedColouredGel.jpg|thumb|250px|A motorized color gel]]\n\nIn the 1930s, Strand Electric of [[London]] provided the first numbering system for their swatches and with their agents in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Sydney]] the numbering system went round the world. Remnants of this original filter color system exist in the color swatches of today (such as Deep Amber = No.&nbsp;3; Primary Red = No.&nbsp;6; Middle Rose = No&nbsp;10; Peacock Blue = No&nbsp;15; Primary Blue = No&nbsp;20; Primary Green = No&nbsp;39). In the theater, gels are typically available in single {{cvt|20|x|24|in|mm|-2}} sheets, which are then cut down to the appropriate size before use. The size originates from the gelatin days: it is the same as a standard baker's sheet, which was used to cast the sheets. In the film industry, gels are usually cut straight from rolls {{cvt|24|or|48|in|mm|-2}} wide and {{cvt|50|ft|m|0}} long, as the size required may vary from a single practical halogen spotlight in a ceiling to a whole window, so a standard-sized sheet would be impractical.\n\n== Colors ==\nSimilar colors may vary between different companies' formulations \u2013 for example, many have a color named \"[[bastard (color)|bastard]] [[amber (color)|amber]]\", but the transmitted color spectrum may be different. For this reason, gel colors are not referred to by name. Apollo Design Technology uses a four digit number based on the [[visible bumm]] to designate and locate specific color transmissions while Rosco used a two digit number for Roscolux, requiring them to prepend some newer gel numbers with a 3 in order to retain this order. Manufacturers use a code consisting of a letter and number combination; for example, AP3250 is a lavender made by Apollo, G841 is a dark blue made under the GAM brand by Rosco, R02 is a light amber made under the Roscolux brand by Rosco, and L216 is a [[diffusion]] filter made by [[Lee Filters]] (note: the AP for Apollo is sometimes shortened to just A).\n\nManufacturers produce swatch books, which contain a small piece of each color available, adjacent to its color code, to simplify ordering. Swatch books enable [[designer]]s and [[technician]]s to have a true representation of the manufacturers' range of colors.\n\nMost{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} designers choose a limited color palette for generic applications because it is financially and logistically difficult to have access to all colors for a single show.\n\n[[File:Complex reflectance.svg|thumb|200px|Color correction gels absorb light of some wavelengths more than others. This Rosco gel has a low transmittance at long wavelengths.]]\n\nThere are also gels for [[color correction]], such as CTB (color temperature blue) and CTO (color temperature orange). Color correction gels alter or correct the [[color temperature]] of a light to more closely match the color temperature of a [[film negative]] or the [[white balance]] of a [[digital imaging|digital imager]]. Specifically CTB, which is [[blue]] in appearance, will correct tungsten lights that typically have a color temperature in the range of 3,200 to 5,700&nbsp;[[kelvin]]s to more closely match the color temperature of \"daylight\" negative, which is usually around 5,400&nbsp;K (nominal daylight). CTO, which is [[orange (color)|orange]] in appearance, will correct a \"daylight\"-balanced light source (such as many common [[Hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide|HMI]] bulbs) to match the color temperature of tungsten negative, which is typically 3,200&nbsp;K. There are \"half\" and \"quarter\" variations of the common color correction gels. It is common to use color correction gels for artistic purposes and not just for negative-to-lightsource correction.\n\nMost ranges of gels also include non-colored media, such as a variety of [[diffusion]] and directional \"silk\" materials to produce special lighting effects. \"Opal\" for example is an [[opalescence|opalescent]] or [[translucent]] [[diffusion filter]].\n\nIt is common for a gel manufacturer to publish the [[transmission coefficient]] or even the spectral [[transmittance]] curve in the swatch book and catalogs. A low transmittance gel will produce relatively little light on stage, but will cast a much more vivid color than a high transmission gel, because the [[colorfulness]] of a light source is directly related to narrowness of its [[spectral linewidth]]. Conversely, the flatter its curve becomes, the closer the gel is to a [[neutral density filter]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Photographic filter]]\n*[[Wratten number]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Stagecraft}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Color Gel}}\n[[Category:Cinematography]]\n[[Category:Optical filters]]\n[[Category:Stage lighting]]\n", "text_old": "{{See also|Photographic filter}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{external links|date=July 2012}}\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2012}}\n}}\n[[File:Many color gels.jpg|right|thumb|Many color gels organized, some in gel frames]]\n\nA '''color gel''' or '''color filter''' ([[American and British English spelling differences|British spelling]]: '''colour gel''' or '''colour filter'''), also known as '''lighting gel''' or simply '''gel''', is a [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] colored material that is used in [[theatre|theater]], event production, [[photography]], [[videography]] and [[cinematography]] to color light and for [[color correction]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.destudiodublin.com/About/Glossary-deStudio.htm#G|title=TV, web/corporate video, film/photography studio and lighting/grip terms glossary \u2013 deStudio, Dublin|website=www.destudiodublin.com|access-date=2018-08-08}}</ref> Modern gels are thin sheets of [[polycarbonate]], [[polyester]] or other heat-resistant plastics<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/technique/expert_advice/how-to-use-lighting-gels-2-4304|title=How to use lighting gels|website=www.amateurphotographer.co.uk|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref>, placed in front of a [[lighting fixture]] in the path of the beam.\n\nGels have a limited life, especially in [[saturation (color theory)|saturated]] colors (lower light transmission) and shorter wavelength (blues).

[[Cod]] and [[herring]] were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or salted, they made their way far inland, but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater [[fish (food)|fish]] was also eaten.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322526811|title=Dietary and behavioral inferences from dental pathology and non-masticatory wear on dentitions from a British medieval town|last=Towle|first=Ian|last2=Davenport|first2=Carole|last3=Irish|first3=Joel|last4=De Groote|first4=Isabelle|date=2017-11-19}}</ref>\n\nThe meals people ate were controlled by the seasons, geography, and religious restrictions. For most people food supply was limited to what the nearby lands and seas could provide. Peasants made do with what they could, primarily cooking over an open fire, in a cauldron or on a spit. Their ovens were typically outside of the home, and made on top of clay or turf.  Poor families primarily consumed grains and vegetables in the form of stew, soup, or pottage, and anything grown on their own small plots of land. They were unable to afford spices, and it was a crime for them to hunt deer, boar, or rabbits. Their staples included rye or barley bread, stews, local dairy products, cheaper meats like beef, pork or lamb, fish if there was access to freshwater, vegetables and herbs grown at home, fruit from local trees and bushes, nuts, and honey.  The upper class and nobility had better food and diet than that the lower classes, but food was eaten in small portions. Meals were laid out with many different colors and flavors\u2014a very different experience from those in the lower class. Smaller portion sizes developed around this time due to various cultural influences, and these large, table-long meals were essentially picked at by the nobility. Foods were highly spiced, and many of these were expensively imported, often from outside Europe. The Middle Ages diet of the upper class and nobility included [[manchet]] bread, a variety of meats like venison, pork, and lamb, fish and shellfish, spices, cheese, fruits, and a limited number of vegetables.<ref>Paul Freedman, Paul,  \"The medieval spice trade.\" in Jeffrey H.

Many fasts occurred throughout the year, and the longest was that of Lent.  There were designated days in which people could not eat meat or fish, but this did not affect the poor very much because of their already-lacking food options. The Church also influenced people to have feasts throughout the year, including on Christmas and for lesser holidays. The noble and upper classes participated in these extravagant feasts, as they often followed a fasting period.<ref>Corrie E.

The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners to territories and ports throughout the world. The potato was slow to be adopted by distrustful European farmers, but soon enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a major role in the 19th century European population boom.<ref>John Michael Francis, ''Iberia and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History : a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia''  (2005) p. 867</ref> However, lack of genetic diversity, due to the very limited number of varieties initially introduced, left the crop vulnerable to disease.There are few mentions of potato being cultivated in India in the travel accounts of Mr. Edward Terry and Mr. Fyer during 17th century.Potato is said to be introduced in India by Portuguese in early 17th century.The Portuguese called it '<nowiki/>'''batata'''<nowiki/>'.Indians later adapted a different word for potato, they called it ''''Alu'''<nowiki/>'--this name came up under British Rule. In 1845, a plant disease known as late blight, caused by the fungus-like [[oomycete]] ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'', spread rapidly through the poorer communities of western [[Ireland]] as well as parts of the [[Scottish Highlands]], resulting in the crop failures that led to the [[Great Irish Famine]].<ref>John Crowley, et al. ''Atlas of the Great Irish Famine'' (2012)</ref>Currently China is the largest potato producing country followed by India as of 2017,FAOSTAT, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\n==Rice==\n{{main|Rice}}\nRice comes from the seasonal plant ''Oryza sativa'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=orsa|title=Plants Profile for Oryza sativa (rice)|website=plants.usda.gov|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref> and has been cultivated since about 6000 BCE. The principal rice-producing countries are in east and south Asia.The origin place of rice has always been a hot point of debate between India and China as both countries started cultivating it around the same time period (says numerous history books and records). The average amount of rice cultivated every year ranges between 800 billion and 950 billion pounds. Muslims brought rice to Sicily in the 9th century. After the 15th century, rice spread throughout Italy and then France, later spreading to all the continents during the age of European exploration. As a cereal grain, today it is the most widely consumed staple food worldwide.Currently India is leading rice producing country according to FAOSTAT, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\n== Spain and Portugal ==\n\nThe Portuguese and Spanish Empires opened up sea trade routes that linked food exchange across the world. Under [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]], Catholic cuisine elements inadvertently helped transform the cuisine of the Americas, Buddhists, Hindus, and Islamic cuisines of the South Eastern Asian region. In Goa, the Portuguese were encouraged by the Crown to marry local women following their conversion. This integration led to mixed cuisine between Portugal and Western India. The Portuguese brought round raised loaves, using wheat shipped from Northern India, as well as pickled pork. The pork was pickled in wine or vinegar with garlic (carne de vinha d\u2019alhos) tied to Portuguese cuisine that later became [[vindaloo]].<ref name=\"Laudan, 2013\">{{Cite book|title=Cuisine and Empire: Cooking in World History|last=Laudan|first=Rachel|publisher=University of California Press|year=2013|isbn=9780520954915|location=|pages=166-206}}</ref><ref>Ben Highmore,  \"Introduction: 'Out of the strong came forth sweetness'-sugar on the move.\" ''New Formations'' 74 (2011): 5-17.</ref>\n\n=== Jesuits ===\nThe Jesuits' influence on cuisine differed from country to country. They sold maize and cassava to plantations in Angola that would later grant provisions to slave traders. They exported sugar and cacao from the Americas to Europe, and in southern parts of the Americas, they dried leaves of the local mate plant that would compete with coffee, tea, and chocolate as the favored hot beverage in Europe. Despite mate's popularity and competition against chocolate, the Jesuits were the leading producers and promoters of chocolate. Using indigenous labor in Guatemala, they shipped it across the world to Southeast Asia, Spain, and Italy. Chocolate's popularity was also in part to the theological consensus that, because it was not considered a food, it could be eaten while fasting. It was thought to have lust-reducing effects applicable to many nuns and monks at the time. The Jesuits introduced several foods and cooking techniques to Japan: deep frying (tempura), cakes and confectionery (kasutera, confetti), as well as the bread still called by the Iberian name ''pan''.<ref>Laudan, (2013), pp 47, 162, 192-98, 257.</ref>\n\n==Early modern Europe==\n[[Grain]] and [[livestock]] have long been the most important agricultural products in France and England. After 1700, innovative farmers experimented with new techniques to increase yield and looked into new products such as hops, oilseed rape, artificial grasses, vegetables, fruit, dairy foods, commercial poultry, rabbits, and freshwater fish.<ref>Joan Thirsk, \"L'agriculture en Angleterre et en France de 1600 \u00e0 1800: contacts, co\u00efncidences et comparaisons.\" ''Histoire, \u00e9conomie et soci\u00e9t\u00e9'' (1999): 5-23.

By 1800 sugar was a staple of working-class diets. For them, it symbolized increasing economic freedom and status.<ref>Sidney Mintz, ''Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History'' (1985).</ref>{{page needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Significance of Islamic cuisine in Eurasia ==\n{{main|Islamic cuisine}}\n\n== Impact of religion on cuisines ==\nThe three most widespread religions (Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam) developed their own distinct recipes, cultures, and practices around food.<ref>Corrie E. Norman,  \"Food and religion.\" in Pilcher, ed., ''The Oxford Handbook of Food History'' (2012) pp. 409-27.</ref>  All three follow two main principles around food: \"the theory of the culinary cosmos and the principle of hierarchy.\"<ref> Laudan, 2013. pp 43-49.</ref> There is a third principle that involved sacrifice.

However, Jewish cuisine is influenced by Jewish dietary laws, [[kashrut]] along with other religious requirements. For example, creating a fire was forbidden on [[Shabbat]] which led to inspiration for slow-cooked Sabbath stews.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ragacs|first=Ursula|date=2011|title=Christian-Jewish or Jewish-Jewish, That's my question ...|journal=European Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=5|issue=1|pages=93\u2013114|doi=10.1163/187247111x579296|issn=1025-9996}}</ref>\n\n{{main|Sephardi Jewish cuisine}}\n[[Sepharic Jews]] were expelled from Iberia in 1492 and migrated to North Africa and the Ottoman lands, blending Iberian cuisine with local cuisine.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Sephardic Jews|doi = 10.1163/2352-0272_emho_dum_027357}}</ref> \n\n{{main|Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine}}\nMany Ashkenazi Jews from Europe and Russia were very poor and their food reflects that.\n\n{{main|Jewish-American cuisine}}\nMany foods considered Jewish in the United States, such as bagels, knishes and borscht are Eastern European Ashkenazidishes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/|title=My Jewish Learning - Judaism & Jewish Life|website=My Jewish Learning|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-15}}</ref> Gentiles also ate the above foods widely throughout Eastern Europe as well.\n\n=== Indian Cuisine ===\nIndia is one of the most diverse countries when it comes to food.Due to wide variety of soil and highly diverse culture, ethnic groups and beliefs this cuisine varies from religion religion. Not just non-veg, India can serve you a delicious plate of veggie food too, which shows how Hinduism has affected this cuisine. Islam religion has also influenced this cuisine during Mughal rule. Samosas being one of the most famous examples of it. Years after Mughal rule when Britishers took over the country they developed a new kind of fusion cuisine known as Anglo-Indian Cuisine, the British wives added a British essence in Indian food giving birth to this fusion cuisine.\n\nJust like Anglo-Indian cuisine there are many other fusion cuisines,\n\n==== Indian Chinese Cuisine ====\n''Main article:Indian Chinese Cuisine''\n\nIndian Chinese cuisine, also known as Indo-Chinese cuisine came into existence when Hakka Chinese people migrated from Canton to Calcutta and interacted with local Indian food. Chowmein and chicken manchurian are some delicious Indo-Chinese dishes.\n\n==== Malaysian Indian Cuisine ====\n''Main article:Malaysian Indian Cuisine''\n\nThis cuisine is a mixture of Malaysian cuisine and Indian cuisine (mostly south Indian).for example:-Appam,Achar.\n\n== Sugar ==\n{{main|History of sugar}}\nSugar is thought to be originated from India by taking sugarcane plant through some chemical and mechanical processes, the word sugar is derived from a Sanskrit word  \u0936\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0930\u093e(sarkara). Previously people used to chew the juice out of sugarcane to enjoy the sweetness of the plants. Later, Indians found the technique to crystallize the sweet liquid. This technique then spreaded towards the neighbouring countries of India.\n\nThe emergence of the Spanish and Portuguese empires provided sugar for Europe By late seventeenth century, as plantations within the Americas continued to grow, Brazil became the dominant sugar producer.<ref>Christopher Ebert, ''Between Empires: Brazilian Sugar in the Early Atlantic Economy, 1550-1630'' (2008) pp 177-80.</ref><ref>Ben Highmore,  \"Introduction: 'Out of the strong came forth sweetness'-sugar on the move.\" ''New Formations'' 74 (2011): 5-17.</ref>\n\nSugar was a rare and expensive sweetener during Middle Ages.Due to the increase of sugar cultivation, obtaining sugar became easier and more affordable. Thus, Europeans could now enjoy Islamic-inspired confectionary goods that were previously costly to produce. The Jesuits were leading producers of chocolate, obtaining it from the Amazon jungle and Guatemala and shipping it across the world to Southeast Asia, Spain and Italy. They introduced Mesoamerican techniques to Europe for processing and preparing chocolate. Fermented cocoa beans had to ground on heated grindstones to prevent producing oily chocolate, a process that was foreign to many Europeans. As a beverage, chocolate remained largely within the Catholic world as it was not considered a food to the church and thus could be enjoyed during fasting.<ref>Sarah Moss and Alexander Badenoch, ''Chocolate: a global history'' ( Reaktion Books, 2009) pp 28-30.</ref>Brazil is currently largest producer of sugar followed by India which is also the largest consumer of sugar.\n\n==19th century==\nLaborers in Western Europe in the 18th century ate bread and  gruel, often in a soup with greens and lentils, a little bacon, and occasionally potato or a bit of cheese. They washed it down with beer (water usually was too contaminated), and a sip of milk. Three fourths of the food was derived from plants. Meat was much more attractive, but very expensive. By 1870 the West European diet was at about 16 kilos per person per year of meat, rising to 50 kilos by 1914, and 77 kilos in 2010. <ref>Lizzie Collingham, ''Taste of War: World War II and the Battle for Food'' (2013) pp 18-19, 516.</ref> Milk, and cheese, was seldom in the diet-- even in the early 20th century, it was still uncommon in Mediterranean diets.<ref>Fernando Collantes,  \"Nutritional transitions and the food system: expensive milk, selective lactophiles and diet change in Spain, 1950-65.\" ''Historia Agraria'' 73 (2017) pp 119-147 in Spanish.</ref>\n\nIn the immigrant neighborhoods of fast-growing American industrial cities, housewives purchased ready-made food through street peddlers, hucksters, push carts, and small shops operated from private homes. This opened the way for the rapid entry of entirely new items such as pizza, spaghetti with meatballs, bagels, hoagies, pretzels, and pierogies into American eating habits, and firmly established fast food in the American culinary experience.<ref>{{cite book|author=Katherine Leonard Turner|title=How the Other Half Ate: A History of Working-Class Meals at the Turn of the Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXclDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA142|year=2014|pages=56, 142|isbn=9780520277571}}</ref>\n\n==20th century==\nIn the first half of the 20th century there were two world wars, which in many places resulted in rationing and hunger; sometimes the starvation of the civilian populations was used as a powerful new weapon. In Germany during World War I the rationing system in urban areas virtually collapsed, with people eating animal fodder to survive the [[Turnip Winter]].<ref>Belinda J. Davis, ''Home Fires Burning: Food, Politics, and Everyday Life in World War I Berlin'' (2000).</ref>  In Allied countries, meat was diverted first to the soldiers, then to urgent civilian needs in Italy, Britain, France and Greece.

The [[American Relief Administration]] (ARA) was set up under the American wartime \"food czar\" [[Herbert Hoover]], and was charged with providing emergency food rations across Central and Eastern Europe. The ARA fed millions, including the inhabitants of Germany and the Soviet Union. After U.S. government funding for the ARA expired in the summer of 1919, the ARA became a private organization, raising millions of dollars from private donors. Under the auspices of the ARA, the European Children's Fund fed millions of starving children.<ref>Frank M. Surface and Raymond L.

After the World War many new food products became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Now instead of an experienced cook spending hours on difficult custards and puddings, the housewife could purchase instant foods in jars, or powders that could be quickly mixed. Wealthier households now had ice boxes or electric refrigerators, which made for better storage and the convenience of buying in larger quantities.<ref>[[Robert Graves]] and Alan Hodge, ''The Long Week-End: A Social History of Great Britain 1918\u20131939'' (1940) pp. 175\u2013176.</ref>\n\nDuring World War II, Nazi Germany tried to feed its population by seizing food supplies from occupied countries, and deliberately cutting off food supplies to Jews, Poles, Russians and the Dutch.<ref>Collingham, ''Taste of War: World War II and the Battle for Food'' (2013) </ref>\n\nAs part of the [[Marshall Plan]] in 1948\u20131950, the United States provided technological expertise and financing for high-productivity large-scale agribusiness operations in postwar Europe. Poultry was a favorite choice, with the rapid expansion in production, a sharp fall in prices, and widespread acceptance of the many ways to serve chicken.<ref>Andrew Godley, \"The emergence of agribusiness in Europe and the development of the Western European broiler chicken industry, 1945 to 1973.\" ''Agricultural History'' Review 62.2 (2014): 315-336.</ref> \n\nThe [[Green Revolution]] was a technological breakthrough in plant productivity that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in the developing world.

Standard foods included  [[bread]], [[porridge]], and [[gruel]]. [[Vicia faba|Fava beans]] and [[vegetable]]s were important supplements to the cereal-based diet of the lower orders.  Meat was expensive and prestigious. [[Game (food)|Game]] was common only on the tables of landowners. The most prevalent butcher's meats were [[pork]], [[chicken (food)|chicken]], and other [[domestic fowl]]; [[beef]], which required greater investment in land, was less common.

For most people food supply was limited to what the nearby lands and seas could provide. Peasants made do with what they could, primarily cooking over an open fire, in a cauldron or on a spit. Their ovens were typically outside of the home, and made on top of clay or turf.  Poor families primarily consumed grains and vegetables in the form of stew, soup, or pottage, and anything grown on their own small plots of land. They were unable to afford spices, and it was a crime for them to hunt deer, boar, or rabbits. Their staples included rye or barley bread, stews, local dairy products, cheaper meats like beef, pork or lamb, fish if there was access to freshwater, vegetables and herbs grown at home, fruit from local trees and bushes, nuts, and honey.  The upper class and nobility had better food and diet than that the lower classes, but food was eaten in small portions. Meals were laid out with many different colors and flavors\u2014a very different experience from those in the lower class. Smaller portion sizes developed around this time due to various cultural influences, and these large, table-long meals were essentially picked at by the nobility. Foods were highly spiced, and many of these were expensively imported, often from outside Europe. The Middle Ages diet of the upper class and nobility included [[manchet]] bread, a variety of meats like venison, pork, and lamb, fish and shellfish, spices, cheese, fruits, and a limited number of vegetables.<ref>Paul Freedman, Paul,  \"The medieval spice trade.\" in Jeffrey H.

Many fasts occurred throughout the year, and the longest was that of Lent.  There were designated days in which people could not eat meat or fish, but this did not affect the poor very much because of their already-lacking food options. The Church also influenced people to have feasts throughout the year, including on Christmas and for lesser holidays. The noble and upper classes participated in these extravagant feasts, as they often followed a fasting period.<ref>Corrie E.

The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners to territories and ports throughout the world. The potato was slow to be adopted by distrustful European farmers, but soon enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a major role in the 19th century European population boom.<ref>John Michael Francis, ''Iberia and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History : a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia''  (2005) p. 867</ref> However, lack of genetic diversity, due to the very limited number of varieties initially introduced, left the crop vulnerable to disease.There are few mentions of potato being cultivated in India in the travel accounts of Mr. Edward Terry and Mr. Fyer during 17th century.Potato is said to be introduced in India by Portuguese in early 17th century.The Portuguese called it '<nowiki/>'''batata'''<nowiki/>'.Indians later adapted a different word for potato, they called it ''''Alu'''<nowiki/>'--this name came up under British Rule. In 1845, a plant disease known as late blight, caused by the fungus-like [[oomycete]] ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'', spread rapidly through the poorer communities of western [[Ireland]] as well as parts of the [[Scottish Highlands]], resulting in the crop failures that led to the [[Great Irish Famine]].<ref>John Crowley, et al. ''Atlas of the Great Irish Famine'' (2012)</ref>Currently China is the largest potato producing country followed by India as of 2017,FAOSTAT, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\n==Rice==\n{{main|Rice}}\nRice comes from the seasonal plant ''Oryza sativa'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=orsa|title=Plants Profile for Oryza sativa (rice)|website=plants.usda.gov|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref> and has been cultivated since about 6000 BCE. The principal rice-producing countries are in east and south Asia.The origin place of rice has always been a hot point of debate between India and China as both countries started cultivating it around the same time period (says numerous history books and records). The average amount of rice cultivated every year ranges between 800 billion and 950 billion pounds. Muslims brought rice to Sicily in the 9th century. After the 15th century, rice spread throughout Italy and then France, later spreading to all the continents during the age of European exploration. As a cereal grain, today it is the most widely consumed staple food worldwide.Currently India is leading rice producing country according to FAOSTAT, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\n== Spain and Portugal ==\n\nThe Portuguese and Spanish Empires opened up sea trade routes that linked food exchange across the world. Under [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II]], Catholic cuisine elements inadvertently helped transform the cuisine of the Americas, Buddhists, Hindus, and Islamic cuisines of the South Eastern Asian region. In Goa, the Portuguese were encouraged by the Crown to marry local women following their conversion. This integration led to mixed cuisine between Portugal and Western India. The Portuguese brought round raised loaves, using wheat shipped from Northern India, as well as pickled pork. The pork was pickled in wine or vinegar with garlic (carne de vinha d\u2019alhos) tied to Portuguese cuisine that later became [[vindaloo]].<ref name=\"Laudan, 2013\">{{Cite book|title=Cuisine and Empire: Cooking in World History|last=Laudan|first=Rachel|publisher=University of California Press|year=2013|isbn=9780520954915|location=|pages=166-206}}</ref><ref>Ben Highmore,  \"Introduction: 'Out of the strong came forth sweetness'-sugar on the move.\" ''New Formations'' 74 (2011): 5-17.</ref>\n\n=== Jesuits ===\nThe Jesuits' influence on cuisine differed from country to country. They sold maize and cassava to plantations in Angola that would later grant provisions to slave traders. They exported sugar and cacao from the Americas to Europe, and in southern parts of the Americas, they dried leaves of the local mate plant that would compete with coffee, tea, and chocolate as the favored hot beverage in Europe. Despite mate\u2019s popularity and competition against chocolate, the Jesuits were the leading producers and promoters of chocolate. Using indigenous labor in Guatemala, they shipped it across the world to Southeast Asia, Spain, and Italy. Chocolate\u2019s popularity was also in part to the theological consensus that, because it was not considered a food, it could be eaten while fasting. It was thought to have lust-reducing effects applicable to many nuns and monks at the time. The Jesuits introduced several foods and cooking techniques to Japan: deep frying (tempura), cakes and confectionery (kasutera, confetti), as well as the bread still called by the Iberian name ''pan''.<ref>Laudan, (2013), pp 47, 162, 192-98, 257.</ref>\n\n==Early modern Europe==\n[[Grain]] and [[livestock]] have long been the most important agricultural products in France and England. After 1700, innovative farmers experimented with new techniques to increase yield and looked into new products such as hops, oilseed rape, artificial grasses, vegetables, fruit, dairy foods, commercial poultry, rabbits, and freshwater fish.<ref>Joan Thirsk, \"L'agriculture en Angleterre et en France de 1600 \u00e0 1800: contacts, co\u00efncidences et comparaisons.\" ''Histoire, \u00e9conomie et soci\u00e9t\u00e9'' (1999): 5-23.

By 1800 sugar was a staple of working-class diets. For them, it symbolized increasing economic freedom and status.<ref>Sidney Mintz, ''Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History'' (1985).</ref>{{page needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Significance of Islamic cuisine in Eurasia ==\n{{main|Islamic cuisine}}\n\n== Impact of religion on cuisines ==\nThe three most widespread religions (Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam) developed their own distinct recipes, cultures, and practices around food.<ref>Corrie E. Norman,  \"Food and religion.\" in Pilcher, ed., ''The Oxford Handbook of Food History'' (2012) pp. 409-27.</ref>  All three follow two main principles around food: \"the theory of the culinary cosmos and the principle of hierarchy.\"<ref> Laudan, 2013. pp 43-49.</ref> There is a third principle that involved sacrifice.

However, Jewish cuisine is influenced by Jewish dietary laws, [[kashrut]] along with other religious requirements. For example, creating a fire was forbidden on [[Shabbat]] which led to inspiration for slow-cooked Sabbath stews.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ragacs|first=Ursula|date=2011|title=Christian-Jewish or Jewish-Jewish, That's my question ...|journal=European Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=5|issue=1|pages=93\u2013114|doi=10.1163/187247111x579296|issn=1025-9996}}</ref>\n\n{{main|Sephardi Jewish cuisine}}\n[[Sepharic Jews]] were expelled from Iberia in 1492 and migrated to North Africa and the Ottoman lands, blending Iberian cuisine with local cuisine.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Sephardic Jews|doi = 10.1163/2352-0272_emho_dum_027357}}</ref> \n\n{{main|Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine}}\nMany Ashkenazi Jews from Europe and Russia were very poor and their food reflects that.\n\n{{main|Jewish-American cuisine}}\nMany foods considered Jewish in the United States, such as bagels, knishes and borscht are Eastern European Ashkenazidishes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/|title=My Jewish Learning - Judaism & Jewish Life|website=My Jewish Learning|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-15}}</ref> Gentiles also ate the above foods widely throughout Eastern Europe as well.\n\n=== Indian Cuisine ===\nIndia is one of the most diverse countries when it comes to food.Due to wide variety of soil and highly diverse culture, ethnic groups and beliefs this cuisine varies from religion religion. Not just non-veg, India can serve you a delicious plate of veggie food too, which shows how Hinduism has affected this cuisine. Islam religion has also influenced this cuisine during Mughal rule. Samosas being one of the most famous examples of it. Years after Mughal rule when Britishers took over the country they developed a new kind of fusion cuisine known as Anglo-Indian Cuisine, the British wives added a British essence in Indian food giving birth to this fusion cuisine.\n\nJust like Anglo-Indian cuisine there are many other fusion cuisines,\n\n==== Indian Chinese Cuisine ====\n''Main article:Indian Chinese Cuisine''\n\nIndian Chinese cuisine, also known as Indo-Chinese cuisine came into existence when Hakka Chinese people migrated from Canton to Calcutta and interacted with local Indian food. Chowmein and chicken manchurian are some delicious Indo-Chinese dishes.\n\n==== Malaysian Indian Cuisine ====\n''Main article:Malaysian Indian Cuisine''\n\nThis cuisine is a mixture of Malaysian cuisine and Indian cuisine (mostly south Indian).for example:-Appam,Achar.\n\n== Sugar ==\n{{main|History of sugar}}\nSugar is thought to be originated from India by taking sugarcane plant through some chemical and mechanical processes, the word sugar is derived from a sanskrit word  \u0936\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0930\u093e(sarkara). Previously people used to chew the juice out of sugarcane to enjoy the sweetness of the plants. Later, Indians found the technique to crystallize the sweet liquid. This technique then spreaded towards the neighbouring countries of India.\n\nThe emergence of the Spanish and Portuguese empires provided sugar for Europe By late seventeenth century, as plantations within the Americas continued to grow, Brazil became the dominant sugar producer.<ref>Christopher Ebert, ''Between Empires: Brazilian Sugar in the Early Atlantic Economy, 1550-1630'' (2008) pp 177-80.</ref><ref>Ben Highmore,  \"Introduction: 'Out of the strong came forth sweetness'-sugar on the move.\" ''New Formations'' 74 (2011): 5-17.</ref>\n\nSugar was a rare and expensive sweetener during middle ages.Due to the increase of sugar cultivation, obtaining sugar became easier and more affordable. Thus, Europeans could now enjoy Islamic-inspired confectionary goods that were previously costly to produce. The Jesuits were leading producers of chocolate, obtaining it from the Amazon jungle and Guatemala and shipping it across the world to Southeast Asia, Spain and Italy. They introduced Mesoamerican techniques to Europe for processing and preparing chocolate. Fermented cocoa beans had to ground on heated grindstones to prevent producing oily chocolate, a process that was foreign to many Europeans. As a beverage, chocolate remained largely within the Catholic world as it was not considered a food to the church and thus could be enjoyed during fasting.<ref>Sarah Moss and Alexander Badenoch, ''Chocolate: a global history'' ( Reaktion Books, 2009) pp 28-30.</ref>Brazil is currently largest producer of sugar followed by India which is also the largest consumer of sugar.\n\n==19th century==\nLaborers in Western Europe in the 18th century ate bread and  gruel, often in a soup with greens and lentils, a little bacon, and occasionally potato or a bit of cheese. They washed it down with beer (water usually was too contaminated), and a sip of milk. Three fourths of the food was derived from plants. Meat was much more attractive, but very expensive. By 1870 the West European diet was at about 16 kilos per person per year of meat, rising to 50 kilos by 1914, and 77 kilos in 2010. <ref>Lizzie Collingham, ''Taste of War: World War II and the Battle for Food'' (2013) pp 18-19, 516.</ref> Milk, and cheese, was seldom in the diet-- even in the early 20th century, it was still uncommon in Mediterranean diets.<ref>Fernando Collantes,  \"Nutritional transitions and the food system: expensive milk, selective lactophiles and diet change in Spain, 1950-65.\" ''Historia Agraria'' 73 (2017) pp 119-147 in Spanish.</ref>\n\nIn the immigrant neighborhoods of fast-growing American industrial cities, housewives purchased ready-made food through street peddlers, hucksters, push carts, and small shops operated from private homes. This opened the way for the rapid entry of entirely new items such as pizza, spaghetti with meatballs, bagels, hoagies, pretzels, and pierogies into American eating habits, and firmly established fast food in the American culinary experience.<ref>{{cite book|author=Katherine Leonard Turner|title=How the Other Half Ate: A History of Working-Class Meals at the Turn of the Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXclDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA142|year=2014|pages=56, 142|isbn=9780520277571}}</ref>\n\n==20th century==\nIn the first half of the 20th century there were two world wars, which in many places resulted in rationing and hunger; sometimes the starvation of the civilian populations was used as a powerful new weapon. In Germany during World War I the rationing system in urban areas virtually collapsed, with people eating animal fodder to survive the [[Turnip Winter]].<ref>Belinda J. Davis, ''Home Fires Burning: Food, Politics, and Everyday Life in World War I Berlin'' (2000).</ref>  In Allied countries, meat was diverted first to the soldiers, then to urgent civilian needs in Italy, Britain, France and Greece. Meat production was stretched to the limit in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Argentina, with oceanic shipping closely controlled by the British.<ref> Richard Perren, \"Farmers and consumers under strain: Allied meat supplies in the First World War.\" ''Agricultural History Review'' (2005): 212-228.</ref> \n\nIn the first years of peace after the war ended in 1918, most of eastern and central Europe suffered severe food shortages. The [[American Relief Administration]] (ARA) was set up under the American wartime \"food czar\" [[Herbert Hoover]], and was charged with providing emergency food rations across Central and Eastern Europe. The ARA fed millions, including the inhabitants of Germany and the Soviet Union. After U.S. government funding for the ARA expired in the summer of 1919, the ARA became a private organization, raising millions of dollars from private donors. Under the auspices of the ARA, the European Children's Fund fed millions of starving children.<ref>Frank M. Surface and Raymond L. Bland, ''American Food in the World War and Reconstruction Period: 1914 to 1924'' (1931). [https://archive.org/details/americanfoodinwo00fran  online]</ref> \n\nThe 1920s saw the introduction of new foodstuffs, especially fruit, transported from around the globe. After the World War many new food products became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Now instead of an experienced cook spending hours on difficult custards and puddings, the housewife could purchase instant foods in jars, or powders that could be quickly mixed. Wealthier households now had ice boxes or electric refrigerators, which made for better storage and the convenience of buying in larger quantities.<ref>[[Robert Graves]] and Alan Hodge, ''The Long Week-End: A Social History of Great Britain 1918\u20131939'' (1940) pp. 175\u2013176.</ref>\n\nDuring World War II, Nazi Germany tried to feed its population by seizing food supplies from occupied countries, and deliberately cutting off food supplies to Jews, Poles, Russians and the Dutch.<ref>Collingham, ''Taste of War: World War II and the Battle for Food'' (2013) </ref>\n\nAs part of the [[Marshall Plan]] in 1948-1950, the United States provided technological expertise and financing for high-productivity large-scale agribusiness operations in postwar Europe. Poultry was a favorite choice, with the rapid expansion in production, a sharp fall in prices, and widespread acceptance of the many ways to serve chicken.<ref>Andrew Godley, \"The emergence of agribusiness in Europe and the development of the Western European broiler chicken industry, 1945 to 1973.\" ''Agricultural History'' Review 62.2 (2014): 315-336.</ref> \n\nThe [[Green Revolution]] was a technological breakthrough in plant productivity that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in the developing world.

It became important in the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th and 20th centuries, when it was primarily used to power steam engines, heat buildings and generate electricity. Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today. Compared to [[wood fuel]]s, coal yields a higher amount of energy per mass and can often be obtained in areas where wood is not readily available. Though it was used historically as a domestic fuel, coal is now used mostly in industry, especially in [[smelting]] and [[alloy]] production as well as [[electricity generation]]. Large-scale [[coal mining]] developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]], and coal provided the main source of [[primary energy]] for industry and transportation in industrial areas from the 18th century to the 1950s. Coal remains an important energy source because of its low cost and abundance compared to other fuels, particularly for electricity generation.<ref name=\"Freese. 2004\">{{cite book|author=Barbara Freese|title=Coal: A Human History|url=https://archive.org/details/coalhumanhistory00free/page/137|year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=[https://archive.org/details/coalhumanhistory00free/page/137 137]|isbn=9780142000984|url-access=registration}}(stating that, \"[c]oal consumption doubled every decade between 1850 and 1890\" and that by turn of the century, \"coal was the unrivaled foundation of U.S. Power,\" providing \"71 percent of the nation's energy.\"</ref> Coal is also mined today on a large scale by [[open pit]] methods wherever the coal [[stratum|strata]] strike the surface or are relatively shallow. Britain developed the main techniques of underground coal mining from the late 18th century onward, with further progress being driven by 19th century and early 20th century progress.<ref name=\"Freese. 2004\"/> However, oil and gas were increasingly used as alternatives from the 1860s onward.\n\nBy the late 20th century, coal was, for the most part, replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by [[petroleum|oil]], [[natural gas]] or electricity produced from oil, gas, [[nuclear power]] or [[renewable energy]] sources.

Typical methods for extraction included [[drift mining]] and [[bell pit]]s. As well as drift mines, small scale [[shaft mining]] was used. This took the form of a bell pit, the extraction working outward from a central shaft, or a technique called [[room and pillar]] in which 'rooms' of coal were extracted with pillars left to support the roofs.

The technology was far in advance of any coal mining method in the late medieval period and was considered one of the industrial wonders of the age.<ref>{{citation | series = The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature | title = From Columba to the Union (Until 10707) | first = Ian | last = Brown}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th century a number of advances in mining techniques were made, such the use of [[Boring (earth)|test boring]] to find suitable deposits and [[chain pump]]s, driven by [[water wheel]]s, to drain the collieries.<ref name = \"Galloway 1882\" />{{rp |57\u20139}}\n\nNorth American coal deposits were first discovered by French explorers and fur traders along the shores of Grand Lake in central New Brunswick, Canada in the 1600s. Coal seams were exposed where rivers flowed into the lake and was dug by hand off the surface and from tunnels dug into the seam. About 1631 the French made their fur trading post at the mouth of the Saint John River their main post in Acadia and started construction of a new fort. The main residence at the fort was designed with two 11 foot wide fireplaces which were stocked with wood and coal from up river. As early as 1643, the French were sending coal and other supplies to the British colony at Boston.\n<ref>Coal Association of Canada, Coal Kit, Coal Evolution module, Digging up the Past http://www.coal.ca/coal-kit {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302115642/http://www.coal.ca/coal-kit/ |date=2016-03-02 }}</ref><ref>Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada (monument in Minto, NB for earliest export of coal) http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=1012</ref><ref>John Winthrop, The Journal of John Winthrop 1630 \u2013 1649, Harvard University / Massachusetts Historical Society, 1996, page 474 (Massachusetts Bay Colony Governor's description of their August 1643 receipt of a ship load of coal from 20 leagues up the Saint John River)</ref><ref>M.A. MacDonald, Fortune & La Tour, The Civil War in Acadia, Toronto, 1983 / Halifax, 2000, Chapter 8  (description of the 1640 use of \"coal from up river\" in the main residence of the French fort at the mouth of the Saint John River)</ref>\n\n==Industrial Revolution==\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the 18th century, and later spread to continental [[Europe]], [[North America]], and [[Japan]], was based on the availability of coal to power [[steam engine]]s. International trade expanded exponentially when coal-fed steam engines were built for the [[railway]]s and [[steamship]]s during the [[Victorian era]]. Coal was cheaper and much more efficient than [[wood fuel]] in most steam engines. As central and [[Northern England]] contains an abundance of coal, many mines were situated in these areas as well as the [[South Wales coalfield]] and [[Scotland]]. The small-scale techniques were unsuited to the increasing demand, with extraction moving away from surface extraction to deep [[shaft mining]] as the Industrial Revolution progressed.<ref>Flinn and Stoker (1984)</ref>\n\nAs [[steamship]]s traveled overseas from the industrialized countries of Europe their need for coal served as trigger for coal mining to start at various locations across the globe.

The location of the [[coalfield]]s helped to make the prosperity of [[Lancashire]], of [[Yorkshire]], and of [[South Wales]]. The Yorkshire pits which supplied [[Sheffield]] were only about 300 feet deep. [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]] were the leading coal producers and they were the sites of the first deep pits. In much of Britain coal was worked from [[drift mine]]s, or scraped off when it outcropped on the surface. Small groups of part-time miners used shovels and primitive equipment.\n\nScottish miners had been bonded to their \"maisters\" by a 1606 Act \"Anent Coalyers and Salters\". A [[Colliers and Salters (Scotland) Act 1775]], recognised this to be \"a state of slavery and bondage\" and formally abolished it; this was made effective by a further law in 1799.<ref>{{cite web|title =Erskine May on Slavery in Britain (Vol. III, Chapter XI) | url =http://www.pdavis.nl/ErskineMay.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=James Barrowman, Mining Engineer |title =Slavery In The Coal-Mines Of Scotland |date= 14 September 1897 |publisher=Scottish Mining Website | url =http://www.scottishmining.co.uk/429.html | accessdate = 2017-11-02 }}</ref>\n\nBefore 1800 a great deal of coal was left in places as extraction was still primitive. As a result, in the deep [[Tyneside]] pits (300 to 1,000&nbsp;ft deep) only about 40 percent of the coal could be extracted. The use of wooden pit props to support the roof was an innovation first introduced about 1800. The critical factor was circulation of air and control of dangerous explosive gases. At first fires were burned at the bottom of the \"upcast\" shaft to create air currents and circulate air, but replaced by fans driven by steam engines. Protection for miners came with the invention of the [[Davy lamp]] and [[Geordie lamp]], where any [[firedamp]] (or [[methane]]) burnt harmlessly within the lamp. It was achieved by preventing the combustion spreading from the light chamber to the outside air with either metal gauze or fine tubes, but the illumination from such lamps was very poor. Great efforts were made to develop better safe lamps, such as the Mueseler produced in the Belgian pits near [[Li\u00e8ge]].\n\nCoal was so abundant in Britain that the supply could be stepped up to meet the rapidly rising demand. In 1700 the annual output of coal was just under 3 million tons. Between 1770 and 1780 the annual output of coal was some 6\u00bc million [[long ton]]s (or about the output of a week and a half in the 20th century). After 1790 output soared, reaching 16 million long tons by 1815 at the height of the [[Napoleonic War]]. By 1830 this had risen to over 30 million tons<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=A Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave|pages=109\u201310}}</ref> The miners, less affected by imported labour or machines than were the [[cotton mill]] workers, had begun to form [[trade union]]s and fight their grim battle for wages against the coal owners and royalty-lessees.<ref>J.

Henderson</ref>\n\nIn South Wales, the miners showed a high degree of solidarity. They lived in isolated villages where the miners comprised the great majority of workers. There was a high degree of equality in life style; combined with an evangelical religious style based on Methodism this led to an ideology of egalitarianism. They forged a \"community of solidarity\" - under the leadership of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|Miners Federation]]. The union supported first the Liberal Party, then after 1918 Labour, with some Communist Party activism at the fringes.<ref name=\"Stefan Llafur Berger 2001 pp 5-40\">Stefan Llafur Berger, \"Working-Class Culture and the Labour Movement in the South Wales and the Ruhr Coalfields, 1850-2000: A Comparison,\" ''Journal of Welsh Labour History/Cylchgrawn Hanes Llafur Cymru'' (2001) 8#2 pp 5-40.</ref>\n\n===Post-1900===\nThe need to maintain coal supplies (a primary energy source) had figured in both [[world war]]s.<ref name=\"Fine 1990\">Fine (1990)</ref> As well as energy supply, coal became a very political issue, due to conditions under which colliers worked and the way they were treated by colliery owners. Much of the 'old [[Left-wing politics|Left]]' of British politics can trace its origins to coal-mining areas, with the main labour union being the [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain]], founded in 1888. The MFGB claimed 600,000 members in 1908. (The MFGB later became the more centralised [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]]).\n\nAlthough other factors were involved, one cause of the [[UK General Strike of 1926]] was concerns colliers had over very dangerous working conditions, reduced pay and longer shifts.\n\nTechnological development throughout the 19th and 20th centuries helped both to improve the safety of colliers and the productive capacity of collieries they worked. In the late 20th century, improved integration of coal extraction with bulk industries such as electrical generation helped coal maintain its position despite the emergence of alternative energies supplies such as oil, natural gas and, from the late 1950s, [[nuclear power]] used for electricity. More recently coal has faced competition from renewable energy sources and bio-fuels.\n\nMost of the coal mines in Britain were purchased by the government in 1947 and put under the control of the [[National Coal Board]], with only the smaller mines left in private ownership. The NUM had campaigned for nationalisation for decades and, once it was achieved, sought to work with the NCB in managing the industry and discouraged strikes. Under the chairmanship of [[Alf Robens]], pit closures became widespread as coal's place in energy generation declined. The NUM leadership continued to resist calls for strike action, but an [[UK miners' strike (1969)|unofficial strike began in 1969]] after a conference pledge on the hours of surface-workers was not acted upon. This was a watershed moment that led to increased spending on the coal industry and a much slower rate of pit closures, as well as the election of more militant officials to the NUM leadership. Under the government of Ted Heath, an [[UK miners' strike (1972)|official strike in 1972]] won increased wages after the Wilberforce Commission. Less than two years later, Heath called a general election over another official strike, called after an overtime ban had led to a [[Three Day Week]] in Britain, and lost the election to the Labour Party. The wage demands were then met and spending on the industry continued to increase, including the establishment of the new [[Selby Coalfield]].\n\nBy the early 1980s, many pits were almost 100 years old and were considered uneconomic<ref>Margaret Thatcher, quoted in B. Fine, The coal question: political economy and industrial change from the Nineteenth Century to the present day</ref> to work at current wage rates compared to cheap [[North Sea oil]] and gas, and in comparison to subsidy levels in [[Europe]]. [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|The Miners' Strike of 1984]] failed to stop the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government's plans under [[Margaret Thatcher]] to shrink the industry, and a break-away [[Union of Democratic Mineworkers]] was founded by miners, mostly in the Midlands, who felt that the NUM had broken its own democratic rules in calling the strike. The [[National Coal Board]] (by then [[British Coal]]), was privatised by selling off a large number of pits to private concerns through the mid-1990s. Because of exhausted seams, high prices and cheap imports, the mining industry disappeared almost completely, despite the militant protests of some miners.<ref name=\"Fine 1990\"/><ref>Ben Curtis, \"A Tradition of Radicalism: The Politics of the South Wales Miners, 1964-1985,\" ''Labour History Review'' (2011) 76#1 pp 34-50</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, the [[South Wales Valleys]] last deep pit mine, [[Tower Colliery]] in Hirwaun, [[Rhondda Cynon Taff]] closed with the loss of 120 jobs.

[[Deerpark Mines]] was the largest opencast site. In 1919 it got rail connections and reached peak production in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite book|author=William Alan McCutcheon|title=The Industrial Archaeology of Northern Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypR3QWtmBRoC&pg=PA108-IA27|year=1984|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson U.P.|page=108|isbn=9780838631256}}</ref>\n\n==United States==\n{{Main|History of coal mining in the United States}}\n\n[[Anthracite]] (or \"hard\" coal), clean and smokeless, became the preferred fuel in cities, replacing wood by about 1850.

After 1850 soft coal, which is cheaper but dirtier, came into demand for railway locomotives and stationary [[steam engine]]s, and was used to make [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for [[steel]] after 1870.<ref>Binder (1974)</ref>\n\nTotal coal output soared until 1918; before 1890, it doubled every ten years, going from 8.4 million short tons in 1850 to 40 million in 1870, 270 million in 1900, and peaking at 680 million short tons in 1918. New soft coal fields opened in [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]] and [[Illinois]], as well as [[West Virginia]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Alabama]].

Lewis]], the United Mine Workers (UMW) became the dominant force in the coal fields in the 1930s and 1940s, producing high wages and benefits.<ref>Dubofsky and Van Tine (1977)</ref> In 1914 at the peak there were 180,000 anthracite miners; by 1970 only 6,000 remained. At the same time [[steam engine]]s were phased out in railways and factories, and [[bituminous coal]] was used primarily for the generation of [[electricity]]. Employment in bituminous peaked at 705,000 men in 1923, falling to 140,000 by 1970 and 70,000 in 2003. UMW membership among active miners fell from 160,000 in 1980 to only 16,000 in 2005, as coal mining became more mechanized and non-union miners predominated in the new coal fields.\n\nIn the 1960s a series of mergers saw coal production shift from small, independent coal companies to large, more diversified firms. Several oil companies and electricity producers acquired coal companies or leased Federal coal reserves in the west of the United States. Concerns that competition in the coal industry could decline as a result of these changes were heightened by a sharp rise in coal prices in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Coal prices fell in the 1980s, partly in response to oil price movements, but primarily in response to the large increase in supply worldwide which was brought about by the earlier price surge. During this period, the industry in the U.S. was characterized by a move towards low-sulfur coal.<ref>[http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/retail.aspx?indid=108&chid=7 \"Coal Mining Industry Report\"] IBISWorld, 2009''</ref>\n\nIn 1987 Wyoming became the largest coal producing state.

Coal is used primarily to generate electricity, but the rapid drop in natural gas prices after 2008 created severe competition.\n\n==Australia==\nIn 1984 Australia surpassed the US as the world's largest coal exporter. One-third of Australia's coal exports were shipped from the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, where coal mining and transport had begun nearly two centuries earlier. Coal River was the first name given by British settlers to the Hunter River after coal was found there in 1795. In 1804 the Sydney-based administration established a permanent convict settlement near the mouth of the Hunter River to mine and load the coal, predetermining the town's future as a coal port by naming it Newcastle. Today, Newcastle, NSW, is the largest coal port in the world.\nNow the state of Queensland is Australia's top coal producer, with its Bowen Basin the main source of black coal, and plans by miners such as [[Gina Rinehart]] to open up the Galilee and Surat Basins to coal mining.\n\n==Canada==\nCanadian coal mining started in New Brunswick and also occurred in Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. The United States has been a major supplier for the industrial regions of [[Ontario]]. By 2000 about 19% of Canada's energy was supplied by coal, much of it imported from the U.S while Eastern Canadian ports import considerable coal from [[Venezuela]].\n\n===New Brunswick===\n\nThe first coal mining in North America began in New Brunswick, Canada in the early 1600s. Coal was found by French explorers and fur traders along the shores of Grand Lake where rivers and erosion had exposed the coal. Small amounts of coal were dug from surface deposits and tunnels dug into the coal seams, and this coal supplied Fort Saint Marie, built by the French about 1632 at the mouth of the Saint John River. The French sold coal to the British colony at Boston as early as 1639. Due to this earliest export of coal in North America, Grand Lake has been recognized as a Canadian Historic Site . Coal mining expanded after the British took control of the area in the mid 1700s and encouraged permanent settlements in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario by British Loyalists. Beginning in 1765, over 11,000 Loyalists settled in N.B., most along the lower 100 miles of the Saint John River and around Grand Lake. Approximately 200,000 tons of coal were dug at Grand Lake between 1639 and 1887 using surface collection, vertical shafts and the room and pillar system. By 1920, the use of draglines and other modern equipment made strip mining possible and the privately owned Grand Lake area mines produced over 200,000 tons per year. Most of this coal was used by the railroad and large businesses. By 1936, a coal burning electric power generating plant at Newcastle Creek was operating with two 33,000 volt lines going to Fredericton and one 66,000 volt line going to Marysville. By 1950, coal production at Grand Lake often reached 1 million tons per year. In 1969, all the privately owned Grand Lake area coal companies and approximately 1,000 employees were consolidated into one provincial government controlled company named N.B. Coal Ltd.. In 2009, the increasing availability of oil and environmental concerns with coal use caused the closing of the Grand Lake coal mines and New Brunswick's coal mining industry.\n\n=== Nova Scotia===\n[[File:Stellarton FoordSeam 077.JPG|thumb|left|Foord Coal Seam, [[Stellarton, Nova Scotia|Stellarton]]]]\nThe first coal mining in Nova Scotia began in the 18th century with small hand-dug mines close to the sea at [[Joggins, Nova Scotia]] and in the [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] area of [[Cape Breton Island]]. Large scale coal mining began in the late 1830s when the General Mining Association (GMA), a group of English mining investors, obtained a coal mining monopoly in Nova Scotia. They imported the latest in mining technology including steam water pumps and railways to develop large mines in the [[Stellarton, Nova Scotia|Stellarton]] area of [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia]], including the Foord Pit which by 1866 was the deepest coal mine in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/about/museumsite.aspx |title=\"History of the Site\", ''Nova Scotia Museum of Industry'' |access-date=2011-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317051008/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/about/museumsite.aspx |archive-date=2011-03-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Coal mining also developed in [[Springhill, Nova Scotia|Springhill]] and [[Joggins]] in [[Cumberland County, Nova Scotia]]. After the GMA monopoly expired, the largest and longest lasting mines developed at [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]] in [[Nova Scotia]]. Nova Scotia was the major supplier of Canadian coal until 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/novascotiaindustry/coalmining/default.aspx |title=\"Coal Mining\", ''Nova Scotia Museum of Industry'' |access-date=2011-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318064424/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/novascotiaindustry/coalmining/default.aspx |archive-date=2011-03-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At its peak in 1949 25,000 miners dug 17 million metric tons of coal from Nova Scotian mines. The miners, who lived in company towns, became politically active in [[left-wing politics]] during labour struggles for safety and fair wages. [[Westray Mine]] near Stellarton closed in 1992 after an explosion killed 26 miners. All the subsurface mines were closed by 2001, although some open pit coal mining continues near Stellarton. The [[Nova Scotia Museum of Industry]] at Stellarton explores the history of mining in the province from its location on the site of the Foord Pit.\n\n===Alberta===\nCoal was easy to find in what is now [[Drumheller]], [[Alberta]], Canada. The [[Atlas Coal Mine]] National Historic Site has turned this coalfield into a museum. This museum interprets how the [[Blackfoot]] and [[Cree]] knew about the \"black rock that burned.\" After many explorers reported coal in the area, a handful of ranchers and homesteaders dug out the coal for their homes. [[Sam Drumheller]] started the coal rush in this area when he bought the land from a local rancher, which he then sold to the [[Canadian National Railway]]. Sam Drumheller also registered a coal mine. However, before his mine opened [[Jesse Gouge]] and [[Garnet Coyle]] beat him to it by opening the [[Newcastle Mine]]. Once the railway was built thousands of people came to mine this area.\n\nBy the end of 1912, there were nine working coal mines, in [[Newcastle, Alberta|Newcastle]], Drumheller, [[Midland, Alberta|Midland]], [[Rosedale, Alberta|Rosedale]], and [[Wayne, Alberta|Wayne]]. In years to follow more mines sprang up: [[Nacmine, Alberta|Nacmine]], [[Cambria, Alberta|Cambria]], Willow Creek, Lehigh, and [[East Coulee, Alberta|East Coulee]]. The timing of the Drumheller mine industry was \"lucky\" according to the Atlas National Historical Site, in that the [[United Mine Workers]] union had recently won the right for better working conditions. As a result of union action, child labour laws were passed to prevent boys under 14 years old working underground.<ref>Robert McIntosh, ''Boys in the pits: Child labour in coal mines'' (McGill-Queen's Press-MQUP, 2000)</ref>\n\nMiners' camps in this area were called \"hell's holes\" because miners lived in tents and shacks. These camps were filled with drinking, gambling and watching fistfights as forms of recreation. With time, living conditions improved: little houses took the place of the tents, and more women joined the men and started families. With new activities such as hockey, baseball and theatre the camps were no longer \"hell's holes\" but became \"the wonder town of the west.\"\n\nBetween 1911 and 1979, 139 mines were registered in the [[Drumheller Valley]], of which only 34 were productive for many years. The beginning of the end for the Drumheller mining industry was the discovery of oil at [[Leduc No. 1]] in 1947, after which [[natural gas]] became the predominant fuel for heating homes in western Canada. As the demand for coal dropped, mines closed and communities suffered. Some communities, Willow Creek for example, completely vanished while others went from boomtowns to ghost towns.\n\nAtlas #4 Mine shipped its last load of coal in 1979, after which the Atlas Coal Mine National Historic Site has preserved the last of the Drumheller mines. Also nearby, [[East Coulee School Museum]] interprets the life of families in mine towns for its visitors.<ref>[http://www.atlascoalmine.ab.ca/] \"Atlas Coal Mine National Historical Site\"</ref>\n\n==France==\n[[Image:Courri\u00e8res 1906 LeJ.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'' the 1906 Courri\u00e8res mine disaster in France]]\n\nPierre-Francois Tubeuf laid the foundations of the modern industry in France, starting in 1770 in Languedoc.<ref>Gwynne Lewis, ''The Advent of Modern Capitalism in France, 1770-1840: The Contribution of Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Tubeuf'' (1993) [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198228950.003.0002 online]</ref> Labor unions emerged with an emphasis on the safety issue in the late 19th century.

Unions gain strength by setting up a system of worker elected mine-safety delegates.

In 1782 the [[Krupp]] family began operations near [[Essen]]. After 1815 entrepreneurs in the [[Ruhr Area]], which then became part of [[Prussia]] took advantage of the tariff zone ([[Zollverein]]) to open new mines and associated [[iron]] smelters. New railways were built by British engineers around 1850. Numerous small industrial centres sprang up, focused on [[ironworks]], using local coal. The iron and [[steel]] works typically bought mines, and erected [[coking]] ovens to supply their own requirements in [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] and gas. These integrated coal-iron firms (\"Huettenzechen\") became numerous after 1854; after 1900 they became mixed firms called \"Konzern.\"\n\nThe average output of a mine in 1850 was about 8,500 short tons; its employment about 64. By 1900, the average mine's output had risen to 280,000 and the employment to about 1,400.<ref>{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=Why was Britain first? The Industrial revolution in global context|url=https://www.academia.edu/1940258|work=Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref> Total [[Ruhr]] coal output rose from 2.0 million short tons in 1850 to 22 in 1880, 60 in 1900, and 114 in 1913, on the verge of war. In 1932 output was down to 73 million short tons, growing to 130 in 1940. Output peaked in 1957 (at 123 million), declining to 78 million short tons in 1974.<ref>Pounds (1952)</ref> At the end of 2010 five coal mines were producing in Germany. The last hard coal mine in Germany closed on December 21st 2018.\n\nThe miners in the Ruhr region were divided by ethnicity (with Germans and Poles) and religion (Protestants and Catholics). Mobility in and out of the mining camps to nearby industrial areas was high. The miners split into several unions, with an affiliation to a political party. As a result, the socialist union (affiliated with the Social Democratic Party) competed with Catholic and Communist unions until 1933, when the Nazis took over all of them. After 1945 the socialists came to the fore.<ref name=\"Stefan Llafur Berger 2001 pp 5-40\"/>\n\n==Belgium==\nBy 1830 when iron and later steel became important in [[Wallonia]] the [[Belgian]] coal industry had long been established, and used [[steam engine]]s for pumping. The Belgian coalfield lay near the navigable [[River Meuse]], so coal was shipped downstream to the ports and cities of the [[Rhine]]-Meuse-[[Scheldt]] [[river delta|delta]]. The opening of the [[Saint-Quentin Canal]] in 1810 allowed coal to go by barge to [[Paris]]. The Belgian coalfield outcrops over most of its area, and the highly folded nature of the coal seams, part of the geological [[Rhenohercynian Zone]], meant that surface occurrences of the coal were very abundant. Deep mines were not required at first, so a large number of small operations sprang up. There was a complex legal system for concessions, and often multiple layers had different owners. Entrepreneurs started going deeper and deeper, thanks to the good pumping system. In 1790, the maximum depth of mines was {{convert|220|m|ft|sp=us}}. By 1856, the average depth in the [[Borinage]] was {{convert|361|m|ft|sp=us}}, and in 1866, {{convert|437|m|ft|sp=us}} and some pits had reached down {{convert|700|to|900|m|ft|-2|sp=us}}; one was {{convert|1065|m|ft|sp=us}} deep, probably the deepest coal mine in [[Europe]] at this time. Gas explosions were a serious problem, and Belgium had high coal miner fatality rates. By the late 19th century the seams were becoming exhausted, and the steel industry was importing some coal from the [[Ruhr]].<ref>Parker and Pounds (1957)</ref> Andr\u00e9 Dumont's discovery in 1900 of coal in the [[Campine]] basin, in the Belgian Province Limburg, prompted entrepreneurs from Li\u00e8ge to open coal mines, mainly producing coal for the steel industry. An announced reorganisation of the Belgian coal mines in 1965 resulted in strikes and a revolt which led to the death of two coal miners in 1966 at the Zwartberg mine. Coal was mined in the Li\u00e8ge basin until 1980, in the Southern Wallonian basin until 1984, and in the Campine basin until 1992.\n\n==Poland==\nThe first permanent coal mine in Poland was established in [[Szczakowa]] near [[Jaworzno]] in 1767. In 19th century development of iron, copper and lead mining and processing in southern Poland (notably in the [[Old-Polish Industrial Region]] and later in the region of [[Silesia]]) led to a quick development of coal mining. Among the most prominent deposits are those located in what are now the [[Upper Silesian Industrial Region]] and [[Rybnik Coal Area]] (formerly part of [[Prussia]]) and the [[Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie]] on the Russian side of the border.\n\nIn modern times coal is still considered a strategic resource for Poland's economy, as it covers roughly 65% of energetic needs. Before and after [[World War II]] Poland has been one of the major coal producers worldwide, usually listed among the five largest. However, after 1989 the coal production is in decline, with the overall production for 1994 reaching 132 million metric tons, 112 million metric tons in 1999 and 104 million metric tons in 2002.\n\n==Russia==\nFrom the 1860s large deposits in the Don Basin (\"Donbas\") in southern Russia supplied 87% of Russia's coal. It was used by railways and the iron and steel industry. After 1900 smaller deposits near Dombrovo, Zabaikal and Cheremkhovo in Siberia were opened. Small older mines south of Moscow also operated. Coal production was controlled by inefficient Russo-British syndicates, and there were shortages of workers, so the companies set up welfare systems for them. Their smallish output and the weak Russian railway system centered on the Ekaterininskaia (Krivoi Rog) Railway held back the growth of Russian heavy industry.<ref>A. M.

In 1939 the Urals produced only half the fuel needed by local industry. During the war the mines were expanded and over 700 factories were evacuated from the west, greatly increasing the demand for Ural coal. Prisoners from the Gulag were sent to the mines; up to a third of the workers were women. The miners were given much higher rations of food. Output doubled and the share of the region in the total national coal production rose from 8% to 22%.<ref>{{cite book|author=Walter Scott Dunn|title=The Soviet Economy and the Red Army, 1930-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dcAgT_2uiYgC&pg=PA38|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood |page=38|isbn=9780275948931}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989-91 militant coal miners in Russia and Ukraine were the mainstay of the revolutionary forced which finally overthrew the Communist system in 1991.<ref>Michael Burawoy and Pavel Michael, \"Russian Miners Bow to the Angel of History,\" ''Antipode'' (Jan 1995) 27#2 pp 115-136.</ref>\n\nToday the Donets Basin is the major coal-mining district in eastern Ukraine and adjacent portions of Russia.

India's export of coal increased, especially to Burma, Ceylon, and the Malay states.<ref>A.B.

The production reached a level of 29 mts. by 1942 and 30 mts. by 1946.\n\nAfter India became independent, the new government stressed the rapid growth of heavy industry. The National Coal Development Corporation was founded in 1956 (as a Government of India) undertaking. The founding of this body was major step in the development of an indigenous Indian coal sector. Especially important was the development of the vast [[Dhanbad]] coal-mining complex with such major operations as Tata Steel, BCCL, ECL and IISCO (Indian Iron And Steel Company), as well as the Indian School of Mines [[IIT (ISM) Dhanbad]] to train engineers, geologists and managers.<ref>Simon Commander, \"Industrialization and Sectoral Imbalance: Coal Mining and the Theory of Dualism in Colonial and Independent India,\" ''Journal of Peasant Studies'' (1981) 9#1 pp 86-96</ref>\n\n==Other countries==\n\nIn the 21st century, Indonesia has expanded its coal mining and by 2011 ranked #5 globally in production.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael S.

The worst single disaster in British coal mining history was at [[Senghenydd Colliery Disaster|Senghenydd]] in the [[South Wales coalfield]]. On the morning of 14 October 1913 an explosion and subsequent fire killed 436 men and boys. Only 72 bodies were recovered. It followed a series of many extensive [[Mining accident]]s in the late 19th century, such as [[The Oaks explosion]] of 1866 and the [[Hartley Colliery Disaster]] of 1862. Most of the explosions were caused by [[firedamp]] ignitions followed by coal dust explosions. At Hartley there was no explosion, but the miners entombed when the single shaft was blocked by a broken cast iron beam from the haulage engine.\nDeaths were mainly caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, known as [[afterdamp]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Mason | first = T. | first2 = Peter | last2 = Atkinson | title = The Hartley Pit Disaster | work = The Science and Art of Mining | publisher = Durham Mining Museum | year = 1911 | url = http://www.dmm.org.uk/archives/a_hart01.htm | accessdate = 3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Courri\u00e8res mine disaster]], Europe's worst mining accident, caused the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on 10 March 1906.

It became important in the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th and 20th centuries, when it was primarily used to power steam engines, heat buildings and generate electricity. Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today. Compared to [[wood fuel]]s, coal yields a higher amount of energy per mass and can often be obtained in areas where wood is not readily available. Though it was used historically as a domestic fuel, coal is now used mostly in industry, especially in [[smelting]] and [[alloy]] production as well as [[electricity generation]]. Large-scale [[coal mining]] developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]], and coal provided the main source of [[primary energy]] for industry and transportation in industrial areas from the 18th century to the 1950s. Coal remains an important energy source because of its low cost and abundance compared to other fuels, particularly for electricity generation.<ref name=\"Freese. 2004\">{{cite book|author=Barbara Freese|title=Coal: A Human History|url=https://archive.org/details/coalhumanhistory00free/page/137|year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=[https://archive.org/details/coalhumanhistory00free/page/137 137]|isbn=9780142000984|url-access=registration}}(stating that, \"[c]oal consumption doubled every decade between 1850 and 1890\" and that by turn of the century, \"coal was the unrivaled foundation of U.S. Power,\" providing \"71 percent of the nation's energy.\"</ref> Coal is also mined today on a large scale by [[open pit]] methods wherever the coal [[stratum|strata]] strike the surface or are relatively shallow. Britain developed the main techniques of underground coal mining from the late 18th century onward, with further progress being driven by 19th century and early 20th century progress.<ref name=\"Freese. 2004\"/> However, oil and gas were increasingly used as alternatives from the 1860s onward.\n\nBy the late 20th century, coal was, for the most part, replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by [[petroleum|oil]], [[natural gas]] or electricity produced from oil, gas, [[nuclear power]] or [[renewable energy]] sources. By 2010, coal produced over a fourth of the world's energy, and by 2050 it is expected to produce about a third.<ref>{{cite book|author=James G.

Typical methods for extraction included [[drift mining]] and [[bell pit]]s. As well as drift mines, small scale [[shaft mining]] was used. This took the form of a bell pit, the extraction working outward from a central shaft, or a technique called [[room and pillar]] in which 'rooms' of coal were extracted with pillars left to support the roofs. Both of these techniques however left considerable amount of usable coal behind.\n\nArcheological evidence in China indicates surface mining of coal and household usage after approximately 3490 BC.\n<ref>{{cite journal|author1=John Dodson|author2=Xiaoqiang|author3=Nan Sun|author4=Pia Atahan|author5=Xinying Zhou|author6=Hanbin Liu|author7=Keliang Zhao|author8=Songmei Hu|author9=Zemeng Yang|title=Use of coal in the Bronze Age in China|journal=The Holocene|date=March 3, 2014|volume=0959683614523155|doi=10.1177/0959683614523155|issue=5|pages=525\u2013530}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest reference to the use of coal in [[metalworking]] is found in the geological treatise ''On stones'' (Lap. 16) by the Greek scientist [[Theophrastus]] (c. 371\u2013287 BC):\n\n{{quote|Among the materials that are dug because they are useful, those known as coals are made of earth, and, once set on fire, they burn like [[charcoal]].

About 1631 the French made their fur trading post at the mouth of the Saint John River their main post in Acadia and started construction of a new fort. The main residence at the fort was designed with two 11 foot wide fireplaces which were stocked with wood and coal from up river.

International trade expanded exponentially when coal-fed steam engines were built for the [[railway]]s and [[steamship]]s during the [[Victorian era]]. Coal was cheaper and much more efficient than [[wood fuel]] in most steam engines. As central and [[Northern England]] contains an abundance of coal, many mines were situated in these areas as well as the [[South Wales coalfield]] and [[Scotland]]. The small-scale techniques were unsuited to the increasing demand, with extraction moving away from surface extraction to deep [[shaft mining]] as the Industrial Revolution progressed.<ref>Flinn and Stoker (1984)</ref>\n\nAs [[steamship]]s traveled overseas from the industrialized countries of Europe their need for coal served as trigger for coal mining to start at various locations across the globe.

The location of the [[coalfield]]s helped to make the prosperity of [[Lancashire]], of [[Yorkshire]], and of [[South Wales]]. The Yorkshire pits which supplied [[Sheffield]] were only about 300 feet deep. [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]] were the leading coal producers and they were the sites of the first deep pits. In much of Britain coal was worked from [[drift mine]]s, or scraped off when it outcropped on the surface. Small groups of part-time miners used shovels and primitive equipment.\n\nScottish miners had been bonded to their \"maisters\" by a 1606 Act \"Anent Coalyers and Salters\". A [[Colliers and Salters (Scotland) Act 1775]], recognised this to be \"a state of slavery and bondage\" and formally abolished it; this was made effective by a further law in 1799.<ref>{{cite web|title =Erskine May on Slavery in Britain (Vol. III, Chapter XI) | url =http://www.pdavis.nl/ErskineMay.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=James Barrowman, Mining Engineer |title =Slavery In The Coal-Mines Of Scotland |date= 14 September 1897 |publisher=Scottish Mining Website | url =http://www.scottishmining.co.uk/429.html | accessdate = 2017-11-02 }}</ref>\n\nBefore 1800 a great deal of coal was left in places as extraction was still primitive. As a result, in the deep [[Tyneside]] pits (300 to 1,000&nbsp;ft deep) only about 40 percent of the coal could be extracted. The use of wooden pit props to support the roof was an innovation first introduced about 1800. The critical factor was circulation of air and control of dangerous explosive gases. At first fires were burned at the bottom of the \"upcast\" shaft to create air currents and circulate air, but replaced by fans driven by steam engines. Protection for miners came with the invention of the [[Davy lamp]] and [[Geordie lamp]], where any [[firedamp]] (or [[methane]]) burnt harmlessly within the lamp. It was achieved by preventing the combustion spreading from the light chamber to the outside air with either metal gauze or fine tubes, but the illumination from such lamps was very poor. Great efforts were made to develop better safe lamps, such as the Mueseler produced in the Belgian pits near [[Li\u00e8ge]].\n\nCoal was so abundant in Britain that the supply could be stepped up to meet the rapidly rising demand. In 1700 the annual output of coal was just under 3 million tons. Between 1770 and 1780 the annual output of coal was some 6\u00bc million [[long ton]]s (or about the output of a week and a half in the 20th century). After 1790 output soared, reaching 16 million long tons by 1815 at the height of the [[Napoleonic War]]. By 1830 this had risen to over 30 million tons<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=A Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave|pages=109\u201310}}</ref> The miners, less affected by imported labour or machines than were the [[cotton mill]] workers, had begun to form [[trade union]]s and fight their grim battle for wages against the coal owners and royalty-lessees.<ref>J.

There was a high degree of equality in life style; combined with an evangelical religious style based on Methodism this led to an ideology of egalitarianism. They forged a \"community of solidarity\" - under the leadership of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|Miners Federation]]. The union supported first the Liberal Party, then after 1918 Labour, with some Communist Party activism at the fringes.<ref name=\"Stefan Llafur Berger 2001 pp 5-40\">Stefan Llafur Berger, \"Working-Class Culture and the Labour Movement in the South Wales and the Ruhr Coalfields, 1850-2000: A Comparison,\" ''Journal of Welsh Labour History/Cylchgrawn Hanes Llafur Cymru'' (2001) 8#2 pp 5-40.</ref>\n\n===Post-1900===\nThe need to maintain coal supplies (a primary energy source) had figured in both [[world war]]s.<ref name=\"Fine 1990\">Fine (1990)</ref> As well as energy supply, coal became a very political issue, due to conditions under which colliers worked and the way they were treated by colliery owners. Much of the 'old [[Left-wing politics|Left]]' of British politics can trace its origins to coal-mining areas, with the main labour union being the [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain]], founded in 1888. The MFGB claimed 600,000 members in 1908. (The MFGB later became the more centralised [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]]).\n\nAlthough other factors were involved, one cause of the [[UK General Strike of 1926]] was concerns colliers had over very dangerous working conditions, reduced pay and longer shifts.\n\nTechnological development throughout the 19th and 20th centuries helped both to improve the safety of colliers and the productive capacity of collieries they worked. In the late 20th century, improved integration of coal extraction with bulk industries such as electrical generation helped coal maintain its position despite the emergence of alternative energies supplies such as oil, natural gas and, from the late 1950s, [[nuclear power]] used for electricity. More recently coal has faced competition from renewable energy sources and bio-fuels.\n\nMost of the coal mines in Britain were purchased by the government in 1947 and put under the control of the [[National Coal Board]], with only the smaller mines left in private ownership. The NUM had campaigned for nationalisation for decades and, once it was achieved, sought to work with the NCB in managing the industry and discouraged strikes. Under the chairmanship of [[Alf Robens]], pit closures became widespread as coal's place in energy generation declined. The NUM leadership continued to resist calls for strike action, but an [[UK miners' strike (1969)|unofficial strike began in 1969]] after a conference pledge on the hours of surface-workers was not acted upon. This was a watershed moment that led to increased spending on the coal industry and a much slower rate of pit closures, as well as the election of more militant officials to the NUM leadership. Under the government of Ted Heath, an [[UK miners' strike (1972)|official strike in 1972]] won increased wages after the Wilberforce Commission. Less than two years later, Heath called a general election over another official strike, called after an overtime ban had led to a [[Three Day Week]] in Britain, and lost the election to the Labour Party. The wage demands were then met and spending on the industry continued to increase, including the establishment of the new [[Selby Coalfield]].\n\nBy the early 1980s, many pits were almost 100 years old and were considered uneconomic<ref>Margaret Thatcher, quoted in B.

[[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|The Miners' Strike of 1984]] failed to stop the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government's plans under [[Margaret Thatcher]] to shrink the industry, and a break-away [[Union of Democratic Mineworkers]] was founded by miners, mostly in the Midlands, who felt that the NUM had broken its own democratic rules in calling the strike. The [[National Coal Board]] (by then [[British Coal]]), was privatised by selling off a large number of pits to private concerns through the mid-1990s. Because of exhausted seams, high prices and cheap imports, the mining industry disappeared almost completely, despite the militant protests of some miners.<ref name=\"Fine 1990\"/><ref>Ben Curtis, \"A Tradition of Radicalism: The Politics of the South Wales Miners, 1964-1985,\" ''Labour History Review'' (2011) 76#1 pp 34-50</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, the [[South Wales Valleys]] last deep pit mine, [[Tower Colliery]] in Hirwaun, [[Rhondda Cynon Taff]] closed with the loss of 120 jobs.

At the same time [[steam engine]]s were phased out in railways and factories, and [[bituminous coal]] was used primarily for the generation of [[electricity]]. Employment in bituminous peaked at 705,000 men in 1923, falling to 140,000 by 1970 and 70,000 in 2003. UMW membership among active miners fell from 160,000 in 1980 to only 16,000 in 2005, as coal mining became more mechanized and non-union miners predominated in the new coal fields.\n\nIn the 1960s a series of mergers saw coal production shift from small, independent coal companies to large, more diversified firms. Several oil companies and electricity producers acquired coal companies or leased Federal coal reserves in the west of the United States. Concerns that competition in the coal industry could decline as a result of these changes were heightened by a sharp rise in coal prices in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Coal prices fell in the 1980s, partly in response to oil price movements, but primarily in response to the large increase in supply worldwide which was brought about by the earlier price surge. During this period, the industry in the U.S. was characterized by a move towards low-sulfur coal.<ref>[http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/retail.aspx?indid=108&chid=7 \"Coal Mining Industry Report\"] IBISWorld, 2009''</ref>\n\nIn 1987 Wyoming became the largest coal producing state. It uses strip mining exclusively. Wyoming's coal reserves total about 69.3 billion tons, or 14.2% of the U.S. coal reserve.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Manuel Lujan|author2=Harry M. Snyder|title=Surface Coal Mining Reclamation: 15 Years of Progress, 1977-1992, Statistical Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9skUgCfSEkC&pg=PA68|year=1992|publisher=DIANE |page=68|isbn=9780788142154}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, competition was intense in the US coal mining industry with some U.S. mines approaching the end of their useful life ([[mine closure]]).{{citation needed|date = August 2013}} Other coal-producing countries also stepped up production to win a share of traditional US export markets. Coal is used primarily to generate electricity, but the rapid drop in natural gas prices after 2008 created severe competition.\n\n==Australia==\nIn 1984 Australia surpassed the US as the world's largest coal exporter. One-third of Australia's coal exports were shipped from the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, where coal mining and transport had begun nearly two centuries earlier. Coal River was the first name given by British settlers to the Hunter River after coal was found there in 1795. In 1804 the Sydney-based administration established a permanent convict settlement near the mouth of the Hunter River to mine and load the coal, predetermining the town's future as a coal port by naming it Newcastle. Today, Newcastle, NSW, is the largest coal port in the world.\nNow the state of Queensland is Australia's top coal producer, with its Bowen Basin the main source of black coal, and plans by miners such as [[Gina Rinehart]] to open up the Galilee and Surat Basins to coal mining.\n\n==Canada==\nCanadian coal mining started in New Brunswick and also occurred in Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. The United States has been a major supplier for the industrial regions of [[Ontario]]. By 2000 about 19% of Canada's energy was supplied by coal, much of it imported from the U.S while Eastern Canadian ports import considerable coal from [[Venezuela]].\n\n===New Brunswick===\n\nThe first coal mining in North America began in New Brunswick, Canada in the early 1600s. Coal was found by French explorers and fur traders along the shores of Grand Lake where rivers and erosion had exposed the coal. Small amounts of coal were dug from surface deposits and tunnels dug into the coal seams, and this coal supplied Fort Saint Marie, built by the French about 1632 at the mouth of the Saint John River. The French sold coal to the British colony at Boston as early as 1639. Due to this earliest export of coal in North America, Grand Lake has been recognized as a Canadian Historic Site . Coal mining expanded after the British took control of the area in the mid 1700s and encouraged permanent settlements in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario by British Loyalists. Beginning in 1765, over 11,000 Loyalists settled in N.B., most along the lower 100 miles of the Saint John River and around Grand Lake. Approximately 200,000 tons of coal were dug at Grand Lake between 1639 and 1887 using surface collection, vertical shafts and the room and pillar system. By 1920, the use of draglines and other modern equipment made strip mining possible and the privately owned Grand Lake area mines produced over 200,000 tons per year. Most of this coal was used by the railroad and large businesses. By 1936, a coal burning electric power generating plant at Newcastle Creek was operating with two 33,000 volt lines going to Fredericton and one 66,000 volt line going to Marysville. By 1950, coal production at Grand Lake often reached 1 million tons per year. In 1969, all the privately owned Grand Lake area coal companies and approximately 1,000 employees were consolidated into one provincial government controlled company named N.B. Coal Ltd.. In 2009, the increasing availability of oil and environmental concerns with coal use caused the closing of the Grand Lake coal mines and New Brunswick's coal mining industry.\n\n=== Nova Scotia===\n[[File:Stellarton FoordSeam 077.JPG|thumb|left|Foord Coal Seam, [[Stellarton, Nova Scotia|Stellarton]]]]\nThe first coal mining in Nova Scotia began in the 18th century with small hand-dug mines close to the sea at [[Joggins, Nova Scotia]] and in the [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] area of [[Cape Breton Island]]. Large scale coal mining began in the late 1830s when the General Mining Association (GMA), a group of English mining investors, obtained a coal mining monopoly in Nova Scotia. They imported the latest in mining technology including steam water pumps and railways to develop large mines in the [[Stellarton, Nova Scotia|Stellarton]] area of [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia]], including the Foord Pit which by 1866 was the deepest coal mine in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/about/museumsite.aspx |title=\"History of the Site\", ''Nova Scotia Museum of Industry'' |access-date=2011-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317051008/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/about/museumsite.aspx |archive-date=2011-03-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Coal mining also developed in [[Springhill, Nova Scotia|Springhill]] and [[Joggins]] in [[Cumberland County, Nova Scotia]]. After the GMA monopoly expired, the largest and longest lasting mines developed at [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]] in [[Nova Scotia]]. Nova Scotia was the major supplier of Canadian coal until 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/novascotiaindustry/coalmining/default.aspx |title=\"Coal Mining\", ''Nova Scotia Museum of Industry'' |access-date=2011-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318064424/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/novascotiaindustry/coalmining/default.aspx |archive-date=2011-03-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At its peak in 1949 25,000 miners dug 17 million metric tons of coal from Nova Scotian mines. The miners, who lived in company towns, became politically active in [[left-wing politics]] during labour struggles for safety and fair wages. [[Westray Mine]] near Stellarton closed in 1992 after an explosion killed 26 miners. All the subsurface mines were closed by 2001, although some open pit coal mining continues near Stellarton. The [[Nova Scotia Museum of Industry]] at Stellarton explores the history of mining in the province from its location on the site of the Foord Pit.\n\n===Alberta===\nCoal was easy to find in what is now [[Drumheller]], [[Alberta]], Canada. The [[Atlas Coal Mine]] National Historic Site has turned this coalfield into a museum. This museum interprets how the [[Blackfoot]] and [[Cree]] knew about the \"black rock that burned.\" After many explorers reported coal in the area, a handful of ranchers and homesteaders dug out the coal for their homes. [[Sam Drumheller]] started the coal rush in this area when he bought the land from a local rancher, which he then sold to the [[Canadian National Railway]]. Sam Drumheller also registered a coal mine. However, before his mine opened [[Jesse Gouge]] and [[Garnet Coyle]] beat him to it by opening the [[Newcastle Mine]]. Once the railway was built thousands of people came to mine this area.\n\nBy the end of 1912, there were nine working coal mines, in [[Newcastle, Alberta|Newcastle]], Drumheller, [[Midland, Alberta|Midland]], [[Rosedale, Alberta|Rosedale]], and [[Wayne, Alberta|Wayne]]. In years to follow more mines sprang up: [[Nacmine, Alberta|Nacmine]], [[Cambria, Alberta|Cambria]], Willow Creek, Lehigh, and [[East Coulee, Alberta|East Coulee]]. The timing of the Drumheller mine industry was \"lucky\" according to the Atlas National Historical Site, in that the [[United Mine Workers]] union had recently won the right for better working conditions. As a result of union action, child labour laws were passed to prevent boys under 14 years old working underground.<ref>Robert McIntosh, ''Boys in the pits: Child labour in coal mines'' (McGill-Queen's Press-MQUP, 2000)</ref>\n\nMiners' camps in this area were called \"hell's holes\" because miners lived in tents and shacks. These camps were filled with drinking, gambling and watching fistfights as forms of recreation. With time, living conditions improved: little houses took the place of the tents, and more women joined the men and started families. With new activities such as hockey, baseball and theatre the camps were no longer \"hell's holes\" but became \"the wonder town of the west.\"\n\nBetween 1911 and 1979, 139 mines were registered in the [[Drumheller Valley]], of which only 34 were productive for many years. The beginning of the end for the Drumheller mining industry was the discovery of oil at [[Leduc No. 1]] in 1947, after which [[natural gas]] became the predominant fuel for heating homes in western Canada. As the demand for coal dropped, mines closed and communities suffered. Some communities, Willow Creek for example, completely vanished while others went from boomtowns to ghost towns.\n\nAtlas #4 Mine shipped its last load of coal in 1979, after which the Atlas Coal Mine National Historic Site has preserved the last of the Drumheller mines. Also nearby, [[East Coulee School Museum]] interprets the life of families in mine towns for its visitors.<ref>[http://www.atlascoalmine.ab.ca/] \"Atlas Coal Mine National Historical Site\"</ref>\n\n==France==\n[[Image:Courri\u00e8res 1906 LeJ.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'' the 1906 Courri\u00e8res mine disaster in France]]\n\nPierre-Francois Tubeuf laid the foundations of the modern industry in France, starting in 1770 in Languedoc.<ref>Gwynne Lewis, ''The Advent of Modern Capitalism in France, 1770-1840: The Contribution of Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Tubeuf'' (1993) [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198228950.003.0002 online]</ref> Labor unions emerged with an emphasis on the safety issue in the late 19th century.

Unions gain strength by setting up a system of worker elected mine-safety delegates. The national government encouraged the mine safety movement as a means of limiting strife in the sometimes turbulent coal fields.<ref>Donald Reid, \"The role of mine safety in the development of working-class consciousness and organization: The case of the Aubin Coal Basin, 1867-1914.\" ''French Historical Studies'' 12#1 (1981): 98-119.

In 1782 the [[Krupp]] family began operations near [[Essen]]. After 1815 entrepreneurs in the [[Ruhr Area]], which then became part of [[Prussia]] took advantage of the tariff zone ([[Zollverein]]) to open new mines and associated [[iron]] smelters. New railways were built by British engineers around 1850. Numerous small industrial centres sprang up, focused on [[ironworks]], using local coal. The iron and [[steel]] works typically bought mines, and erected [[coking]] ovens to supply their own requirements in [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] and gas. These integrated coal-iron firms (\"Huettenzechen\") became numerous after 1854; after 1900 they became mixed firms called \"Konzern.\"\n\nThe average output of a mine in 1850 was about 8,500 short tons; its employment about 64. By 1900, the average mine's output had risen to 280,000 and the employment to about 1,400.<ref>{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=Why was Britain first? The Industrial revolution in global context|url=https://www.academia.edu/1940258|work=Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref> Total [[Ruhr]] coal output rose from 2.0 million short tons in 1850 to 22 in 1880, 60 in 1900, and 114 in 1913, on the verge of war. In 1932 output was down to 73 million short tons, growing to 130 in 1940. Output peaked in 1957 (at 123 million), declining to 78 million short tons in 1974.<ref>Pounds (1952)</ref> At the end of 2010 five coal mines were producing in Germany. The last hard coal mine in Germany closed on december 21st 2018.\n\nThe miners in the Ruhr region were divided by ethnicity (with Germans and Poles) and religion (Protestants and Catholics). Mobility in and out of the mining camps to nearby industrial areas was high. The miners split into several unions, with an affiliation to a political party. As a result, the socialist union (affiliated with the Social Democratic Party) competed with Catholic and Communist unions until 1933, when the Nazis took over all of them. After 1945 the socialists came to the fore.<ref name=\"Stefan Llafur Berger 2001 pp 5-40\"/>\n\n==Belgium==\nBy 1830 when iron and later steel became important in [[Wallonia]] the [[Belgian]] coal industry had long been established, and used [[steam engine]]s for pumping. The Belgian coalfield lay near the navigable [[River Meuse]], so coal was shipped downstream to the ports and cities of the [[Rhine]]-Meuse-[[Scheldt]] [[river delta|delta]]. The opening of the [[Saint-Quentin Canal]] in 1810 allowed coal to go by barge to [[Paris]]. The Belgian coalfield outcrops over most of its area, and the highly folded nature of the coal seams, part of the geological [[Rhenohercynian Zone]], meant that surface occurrences of the coal were very abundant. Deep mines were not required at first, so a large number of small operations sprang up. There was a complex legal system for concessions, and often multiple layers had different owners. Entrepreneurs started going deeper and deeper, thanks to the good pumping system. In 1790, the maximum depth of mines was {{convert|220|m|ft|sp=us}}. By 1856, the average depth in the [[Borinage]] was {{convert|361|m|ft|sp=us}}, and in 1866, {{convert|437|m|ft|sp=us}} and some pits had reached down {{convert|700|to|900|m|ft|-2|sp=us}}; one was {{convert|1065|m|ft|sp=us}} deep, probably the deepest coal mine in [[Europe]] at this time. Gas explosions were a serious problem, and Belgium had high coal miner fatality rates. By the late 19th century the seams were becoming exhausted, and the steel industry was importing some coal from the [[Ruhr]].<ref>Parker and Pounds (1957)</ref> Andr\u00e9 Dumont's discovery in 1900 of coal in the [[Campine]] basin, in the Belgian Province Limburg, prompted entrepreneurs from Li\u00e8ge to open coal mines, mainly producing coal for the steel industry. An announced reorganisation of the Belgian coal mines in 1965 resulted in strikes and a revolt which led to the death of two coal miners in 1966 at the Zwartberg mine. Coal was mined in the Li\u00e8ge basin until 1980, in the Southern Wallonian basin until 1984, and in the Campine basin until 1992.\n\n==Poland==\nThe first permanent coal mine in Poland was established in [[Szczakowa]] near [[Jaworzno]] in 1767. In 19th century development of iron, copper and lead mining and processing in southern Poland (notably in the [[Old-Polish Industrial Region]] and later in the region of [[Silesia]]) led to a quick development of coal mining. Among the most prominent deposits are those located in what are now the [[Upper Silesian Industrial Region]] and [[Rybnik Coal Area]] (formerly part of [[Prussia]]) and the [[Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie]] on the Russian side of the border.\n\nIn modern times coal is still considered a strategic resource for Poland's economy, as it covers roughly 65% of energetic needs. Before and after [[World War II]] Poland has been one of the major coal producers worldwide, usually listed among the five largest. However, after 1989 the coal production is in decline, with the overall production for 1994 reaching 132 million metric tons, 112 million metric tons in 1999 and 104 million metric tons in 2002.\n\n==Russia==\nFrom the 1860s large deposits in the Don Basin (\"Donbas\") in southern Russia supplied 87% of Russia's coal. It was used by railways and the iron and steel industry. After 1900 smaller deposits near Dombrovo, Zabaikal and Cheremkhovo in Siberia were opened. Small older mines south of Moscow also operated. Coal production was controlled by inefficient Russo-British syndicates, and there were shortages of workers, so the companies set up welfare systems for them. Their smallish output and the weak Russian railway system centered on the Ekaterininskaia (Krivoi Rog) Railway held back the growth of Russian heavy industry.<ref>A. M.

In 1939 the Urals produced only half the fuel needed by local industry. During the war the mines were expanded and over 700 factories were evacuated from the west, greatly increasing the demand for Ural coal. Prisoners from the Gulag were sent to the mines; up to a third of the workers were women. The miners were given much higher rations of food. Output doubled and the share of the region in the total national coal production rose from 8% to 22%.<ref>{{cite book|author=Walter Scott Dunn|title=The Soviet Economy and the Red Army, 1930-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dcAgT_2uiYgC&pg=PA38|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood |page=38|isbn=9780275948931}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989-91 militant coal miners in Russia and Ukraine were the mainstay of the revolutionary forced which finally overthrew the Communist system in 1991.<ref>Michael Burawoy and Pavel Michael, \"Russian Miners Bow to the Angel of History,\" ''Antipode'' (Jan 1995) 27#2 pp 115-136.</ref>\n\nToday the Donets Basin is the major coal-mining district in eastern Ukraine and adjacent portions of Russia.

India's export of coal increased, especially to Burma, Ceylon, and the Malay states.<ref>A.B.

The production reached a level of 29 mts. by 1942 and 30 mts. by 1946.\n\nAfter India became independent, the new government stressed the rapid growth of heavy industry. The National Coal Development Corporation was founded in 1956 (as a Government of India) undertaking. The founding of this body was major step in the development of an indigenous Indian coal sector. Especially important was the development of the vast [[Dhanbad]] coal-mining complex with such major operations as Tata Steel, BCCL, ECL and IISCO (Indian Iron And Steel Company), as well as the Indian School of Mines [[IIT (ISM) Dhanbad]] to train engineers, geologists and managers.<ref>Simon Commander, \"Industrialization and Sectoral Imbalance: Coal Mining and the Theory of Dualism in Colonial and Independent India,\" ''Journal of Peasant Studies'' (1981) 9#1 pp 86-96</ref>\n\n==Other countries==\n\nIn the 21st century, Indonesia has expanded its coal mining and by 2011 ranked #5 globally in production.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael S.

It followed a series of many extensive [[Mining accident]]s in the late 19th century, such as [[The Oaks explosion]] of 1866 and the [[Hartley Colliery Disaster]] of 1862. Most of the explosions were caused by [[firedamp]] ignitions followed by coal dust explosions. At Hartley there was no explosion, but the miners entombed when the single shaft was blocked by a broken cast iron beam from the haulage engine.\nDeaths were mainly caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, known as [[afterdamp]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Mason | first = T. | first2 = Peter | last2 = Atkinson | title = The Hartley Pit Disaster | work = The Science and Art of Mining | publisher = Durham Mining Museum | year = 1911 | url = http://www.dmm.org.uk/archives/a_hart01.htm | accessdate = 3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Courri\u00e8res mine disaster]], Europe's worst mining accident, caused the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on 10 March 1906.

{"title_page": "Cabinet rank", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=February 2017}}\nA person who is of '''Cabinet rank''' holds a ministerial position in a government. They sit in [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] and form the highest body of leadership in a government.\n\n==United Kingdom==\nIn the [[UK]], the top three ministers after the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] are traditionally the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and [[Home Secretary]]. In that order, these four positions are referred to as the [[Great Offices of State]], the most prestigious positions in government. However, the high prestige of these positions has not always run with Cabinet rank.

CCTV systems may operate continuously or only as required to monitor a particular event. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing [[digital video recorder]]s (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as [[motion detection]] and email alerts). More recently, decentralized [[IP camera]]s, perhaps equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to [[network-attached storage]] devices, or internal flash for completely stand-alone operation.\n\nThere are about 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide as of 2016. About 65% of these cameras are installed in Asia.

The development of reel-to-reel media enabled the recording of surveillance footage. These systems required magnetic tapes to be changed manually, which was a time-consuming, expensive and unreliable process, with the operator having to manually thread the tape from the tape reel through the recorder onto an empty take-up reel. Due to these shortcomings, video surveillance was not widespread. [[VCR]] technology became available in the 1970s, making it easier to record and erase information, and the use of video surveillance became more common.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaQY8CrmqFcC&pg=PA276 |title=CCTV Surveillance|isbn=9780080468181|last1=Kruegle|first1=Herman|date=15 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1990s, digital [[multiplexing]] was developed, allowing several cameras to record at once, as well as [[Time lapse photography|time lapse]] and motion-only recording.

CCTV monitors for viewing the event by attendees are often placed in lounges, hallways, and restrooms.\nIn a trial with CCTV camera's, football club fans no longer need to identify themselves manually, but could pass freely after being authorized by the facial recognition system.<ref>[https://www.heracles.nl/nieuws/nieuwsbericht/12992/doe-mee-aan-de-proef-met-gezichtsherkenning Trial by 20Face]</ref>\n\n=== Employee monitoring ===\n{{See also|Employee monitoring}}\nOrganizations use CCTV to monitor the actions of workers. Every action is recorded as an information block with subtitles that explain the performed operation. This helps to track the actions of workers, especially when they are making critical financial transactions, such as correcting or cancelling of a sale, withdrawing money or altering personal information.\n\nActions which an employer may wish to monitor could include:\n* Scanning of goods, selection of goods, introduction of price and quantity;\n* Input and output of operators in the system when entering passwords;\n* Deleting operations and modifying existing documents;\n* Implementation of certain operations, such as financial statements or operations with cash;\n* Moving goods, revaluation scrapping and counting;\n* Control in the kitchen of fast food restaurants;\n* Change of settings, reports and other official functions.\n\nEach of these operations is transmitted with a description, allowing detailed monitoring of all actions of the operator. Some systems allow the user to search for a specific event by time of occurrence and text description, and perform statistical evaluation of operator behaviour. This allows the software to predict deviations from the standard workflow and record only anomalous behaviour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/archive/library/subject-gateways/business-management/smes/small-business-update/2015-01/using-cctv-to-monitor-the-workplace|title=Using CCTV to monitor the workplace |publisher= icaew |access-date=2016-09-18}}</ref>\n\n===Use in schools===\nIn the United States, Britain,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.atl.org.uk/policy-and-campaigns/policy-posts/use-cctv-surveillance-schools?resetmyATL=true|title= Use of CCTV surveillance in schools| author= ATL|accessdate=8 November 2016|publisher= ATL the education union|date=22 October 2013}}</ref> Australia<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/school-security-cctv-puts-bullies-on-pause/story-e6freuzi-1226311797645|title= School security CCTV puts bullies on pause | author= Bruce McDougall and Katherine Danks |accessdate=8 November 2016|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|date=28 March 2012}}</ref> and New Zealand, CCTV is widely used in schools due to its success in preventing [[bullying]], [[vandalism]], monitoring visitors and maintaining a record of evidence in the event of a crime. There are some restrictions on installation, with cameras not being installed in an area where there is a \"reasonable [[expectation of privacy]]\", such as bathrooms, gym locker areas and private offices (unless consent by the office occupant is given). Cameras are generally acceptable in hallways, parking lots, front offices where students, employees, and parents come and go, gymnasiums, cafeterias, supply rooms and classrooms. The installation of cameras in classrooms may be objected to by some teachers.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/school/ch2a_18.html/|title = Legal aspects of the use of video cameras in schools =|access-date = 25 March 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160215174520/https://www.ncjrs.gov/school/ch2a_18.html/|archive-date = 15 February 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n===Use in private homes===\nMany home owners now choose to install CCTV systems on their own homes. CCTV cameras are an effective deterrent to criminals as it increases the risk of criminals being caught because they could be identified through the camera footage. Most criminals will scout through affluent suburbs looking for the easiest house to break into. Having an obvious CCTV system, or another security alarm, makes the house appear to be a more difficult target so the criminals will likely move on to the next house. \nModern CCTV systems can be monitored through mobile phone apps so it is possible to view live footage of your house from anywhere you have internet coverage. Some systems even provide motion detection so when movement is detected, an alert can be sent to your phone.\n\n=== Criminal use ===\n\nCriminals may use surveillance cameras to monitor the public. For example, a hidden camera at an [[Automated Teller Machine|ATM]] can capture people's [[Personal Identification Number|PINs]] as they are entered, without their knowledge. The devices are small enough not to be noticed, and are placed where they can monitor the keypad of the machine as people enter their PINs. Images may be transmitted wirelessly to the criminal. Even lawful surveillance cameras sometimes have their data go into the hands of people who have no legal right to receive it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.letelegramme.fr/france/benalla-trois-policiers-suspendus-pour-avoir-transmis-des-images-de-videosurveillance-20-07-2018-12032279.php|title=Benalla.

CCTV systems may operate continuously or only as required to monitor a particular event. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing [[digital video recorder]]s (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as [[motion detection]] and email alerts). More recently, decentralized [[IP camera]]s, perhaps equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to [[network-attached storage]] devices, or internal flash for completely stand-alone operation.\n\nThere are about 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide as of 2016. About 65% of these cameras are installed in Asia.

The development of reel-to-reel media enabled the recording of surveillance footage. These systems required magnetic tapes to be changed manually, which was a time consuming, expensive and unreliable process, with the operator having to manually thread the tape from the tape reel through the recorder onto an empty take-up reel. Due to these shortcomings, video surveillance was not widespread. [[VCR]] technology became available in the 1970s, making it easier to record and erase information, and the use of video surveillance became more common.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaQY8CrmqFcC&pg=PA276 |title=CCTV Surveillance|isbn=9780080468181|last1=Kruegle|first1=Herman|date=15 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1990s, digital [[multiplexing]] was developed, allowing several cameras to record at once, as well as [[Time lapse photography|time lapse]] and motion-only recording.

A 2017 review published in [[Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention]] compiles seven studies that use such research designs. The studies included in the review found that CCTV reduced crime by 24-28% in public streets and urban subway stations. It also found that CCTV could decrease unruly behaviour in football stadiums and theft in supermarkets/mass merchant stores. However, there was no evidence of CCTV having desirable effects in parking facilities or suburban subway stations. Furthermore, the review indicates that CCTV is more effective in preventing property crimes than in violent crimes.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Surveillance cameras and crime: a review of randomized and natural experiments|journal = Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention|date = 2017|issn = |pages = 210\u2013222|volume = 18|issue = 2| author = Gustav Alexandrie|doi = 10.1080/14043858.2017.1387410}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexis Navy Yard 012 1dsLQLVk7nY.jpg|thumb|left|Closed-circuit video cameras in the Navy Yard complex caught gunman Aaron Alexis during his [[Washington Navy Yard shooting|shooting rampage]].]]\nAnother question in the effectiveness of CCTV for policing is around uptime of the system; in 2013 City of Philadelphia Auditor found that the $15M system was operational only 32% of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viakoo.com/orphaned-video-system-in-philadelphia/|title=Orphaned Video System in Philadelphia?|date=May 2015}}</ref> There is strong anecdotal evidence that CCTV aids in detection and conviction of offenders; indeed UK police forces routinely seek CCTV recordings after crimes.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10512087/10484338Police-are-failing-to-recover-crucial-CCTV-footage-new-figures-suggest.html?fbHow&goback=%2Egde_1889337_member_5817222616544473092 \"Police are failing to recover crucial CCTV footage, new figures suggest\"], The Daily Telegraph</ref>.

CCTV monitors for viewing the event by attendees are often placed in lounges, hallways, and restrooms.\nIn a trial with CCTV camera's, football club fans no longer need to identify themselves manually, but could pass freely after being authorized by the facial recognition system.<ref>[https://www.heracles.nl/nieuws/nieuwsbericht/12992/doe-mee-aan-de-proef-met-gezichtsherkenning Trial by 20Face]</ref>\n\n=== Employee monitoring ===\n{{See also|Employee monitoring}}\nOrganizations use CCTV to monitor the actions of workers. Every action is recorded as an information block with subtitles that explain the performed operation. This helps to track the actions of workers, especially when they are making critical financial transactions, such as correcting or cancelling of a sale, withdrawing money or altering personal information.\n\nActions which an employer may wish to monitor could include:\n* Scanning of goods, selection of goods, introduction of price and quantity;\n* Input and output of operators in the system when entering passwords;\n* Deleting operations and modifying existing documents;\n* Implementation of certain operations, such as financial statements or operations with cash;\n* Moving goods, revaluation scrapping and counting;\n* Control in the kitchen of fast food restaurants;\n* Change of settings, reports and other official functions.\n\nEach of these operations is transmitted with a description, allowing detailed monitoring of all actions of the operator. Some systems allow the user to search for a specific event by time of occurrence and text description, and perform statistical evaluation of operator behaviour. This allows the software to predict deviations from the standard workflow and record only anomalous behaviour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/archive/library/subject-gateways/business-management/smes/small-business-update/2015-01/using-cctv-to-monitor-the-workplace|title=Using CCTV to monitor the workplace |publisher= icaew |access-date=2016-09-18}}</ref>\n\n===Use in schools===\nIn the United States, Britain,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.atl.org.uk/policy-and-campaigns/policy-posts/use-cctv-surveillance-schools?resetmyATL=true|title= Use of CCTV surveillance in schools| author= ATL|accessdate=8 November 2016|publisher= ATL the education union|date=22 October 2013}}</ref> Australia<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/school-security-cctv-puts-bullies-on-pause/story-e6freuzi-1226311797645|title= School security CCTV puts bullies on pause | author= Bruce McDougall and Katherine Danks |accessdate=8 November 2016|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|date=28 March 2012}}</ref> and New Zealand, CCTV is widely used in schools due to its success in preventing [[bullying]], [[vandalism]], monitoring visitors and maintaining a record of evidence in the event of a crime. There are some restrictions on installation, with cameras not being installed in an area where there is a \"reasonable [[expectation of privacy]]\", such as bathrooms, gym locker areas and private offices (unless consent by the office occupant is given). Cameras are generally acceptable in hallways, parking lots, front offices where students, employees, and parents come and go, gymnasiums, cafeterias, supply rooms and classrooms. The installation of cameras in classrooms may be objected to by some teachers.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/school/ch2a_18.html/|title = Legal aspects of the use of video cameras in schools =|access-date = 25 March 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160215174520/https://www.ncjrs.gov/school/ch2a_18.html/|archive-date = 15 February 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n===Use in private homes===\nMany home owners now choose to install CCTV systems on their own homes. CCTV cameras are an effective deterrent to criminals as it increases the risk of criminals being caught because they could be identified through the camera footage. Most criminals will scout through affluent suburbs looking for the easiest house to break into. Having an obvious CCTV system, or another security alarm, makes the house appear to be a more difficult target so the criminals will likely move on to the next house. \nModern CCTV systems can be monitored through mobile phone apps so it is possible to view live footage of your house from anywhere you have internet coverage. Some systems even provide motion detection so when movement is detected, an alert can be sent to your phone.\n\n=== Criminal use ===\n\nCriminals may use surveillance cameras to monitor the public. For example, a hidden camera at an [[Automated Teller Machine|ATM]] can capture people's [[Personal Identification Number|PINs]] as they are entered, without their knowledge. The devices are small enough not to be noticed, and are placed where they can monitor the keypad of the machine as people enter their PINs. Images may be transmitted wirelessly to the criminal. Even lawful surveillance cameras sometimes have their data go into the hands of people who have no legal right to receive it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.letelegramme.fr/france/benalla-trois-policiers-suspendus-pour-avoir-transmis-des-images-de-videosurveillance-20-07-2018-12032279.php|title=Benalla.

The project easily surpassed its funding goal of $28,000 and reflectacles became commercially available in June 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/reflectacles/reflectacles-reflective-eyewear-and-sunglasses|title=Reflectacles - Reflective Eyewear and Sunglasses|website=Kickstarter}}</ref>\n\n[[File:CCTV graffiti - geograph.org.uk - 977154.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Anti-CCTV graffiti]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Artificial intelligence for video surveillance]]\n* [[Bugging]]\n* [[Cable TV|\"CATV\" as cable television]]\u2014not to be confused with CCTV\n* [[Closed-circuit television camera]]\n* [[Documentary practice]]\n* [[Eye in the sky (camera)]]\n* [[Fake security camera]]\n* [[INDECT]]\n* [[Information Awareness Office]]\n* [[IP camera]]\n* [[Motion (surveillance software)]]\n* [[Optic Nerve (GCHQ)]]\n* [[Physical security]]\n* [[Physical security information management]] (PSIM)\n* [[Privacy International]]\n* [[Security operations center]]\n* [[Security smoke]]\n* [[Shodan (website)]]\n* [[Smart camera]]\n* [[Sousveillance]] (inverse surveillance)\n* [[Super recognisers]]\n* [[Surveillance]]\n* [[Telescreen]]\n* [[The Convention on Modern Liberty]]\n* [[TV Network Protocol]]\n* [[Under vehicle inspection]]\n* [[Video analytics]]\n* [[Videotelephony]]\n* [[Washington County Closed-Circuit Educational Television Project]]\n* [[Webcam]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!-- * {{cite book|title=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|url=}} -->\n* {{cite book|editor=Armstrong, Gary|title=The maximum surveillance society: the rise of CCTV|publisher=Berg (originally, University of Michigan Press)|year=1999|isbn=9781859732212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gENAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Fyfe, Nicholas|author2=Bannister, Jon|chapter=City Watching: Closed-Circuit Television in Public Spaces|editors=Fyfe, Nicholas & Kenny, Judith T.|title=The Urban Geography Reader|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2005|isbn=9780415307017|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=box4yhB5TL4C&pg=PA364|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/urbangeographyre0000unse}}\n* {{cite book|authors=Newburn, Tim & Hayman, Stephanie|title=Policing, Surveillance and Social Control: CCTV and police monitoring of suspects|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2001|isbn=9781843924692|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YaonBzDpUjIC&printsec=frontcover}} \n* {{cite book|author=Norris, Clive|chapter=From Personal to Digital: CCTV, the panopticon, and the technological mediation of suspicion and social control|editor=Lyon, David|title=Surveillance as Social Sorting: Privacy, Risk, and Digital Discrimination|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|isbn=9780415278737|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCLFBfZwl08C&pg=PA249}}\n* {{cite web|title=IP Camera|url=http://www.stopdedief.be/|website=Stopdedief.be}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Closed-circuit television (CCTV)}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070212072806/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors292.pdf Assessing the Impact of CCTV, a UK Home office study on the effectiveness of closed-circuit television]\n\n{{privacy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Closed-Circuit Television}}\n[[Category:Applications of computer vision]]\n[[Category:Assistive technology]]\n[[Category:Crime prevention]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement techniques]]\n[[Category:Physical security]]\n[[Category:Public safety]]\n[[Category:Security engineering]]\n[[Category:Security technology]]\n[[Category:Surveillance]]\n[[Category:Video surveillance]]\n[[Category:Video]]\n[[Category:Warning systems]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications-related introductions in 1942]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: time consuming \u2192 time-consuming, Phillipines \u2192 Philippines", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television"}

In the first series, the race started from [[London]] and finished in [[Singapore]]. The competitors cannot fly but were each given a money belt containing an amount of money equivalent to a one-way plane ticket to their final destination, which they can use to travel by land or by sea. The money pays for all the cost of the travel including food and accommodation, but they may work to earn money along the way. The competitors may not have any mobile electronic devices or credit cards at the start of the race, but were given a world map, a GPS device to track their progress and for safety as well as finding the checkpoints, and a travel guide with local job adverts, in addition to the money. In every episode, the teams were given a checkpoint they had to reach. One team may be eliminated if they come last at a pre-determined checkpoint. At each checkpoint, the racers were given a 36-hour break. The first team to reach the final destination win a cash prize of \u00a320,000.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n==Production==\nBefore the race, two assistant producers conducted a [[Recce (filmmaking)|recce]] research trip to assess the feasibility of such a journey within the budget constraints. All likely bus and train journeys were assessed beforehand. Visas were applied for the countries along all possible routes before the race as well as any necessary vaccinations for these countries.<ref name=broadcast /> \n\nDuring the race, each team had two film crew members who travelled along with them. All decisions, however, were made by the racers and the crew cannot interfere with their choices. A director of photography travelled behind the teams for additional location filming. To ensure the safety of the racers, there may be local fixers and security advisers who observed the racers from a distance, and medical support vehicle also travelled an hour behind the team in some countries.<ref name=\"bbc turner\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47827316 |title= Race Across the World: How the BBC series was made |first= Lauren |last=Turner|work=BBC News|date=6 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/08/theft-riots-and-28-hour-buses-the-secrets-of-race-across-the-world-bbc |title=Theft, riots and 28-hour buses: the secrets of Race Across the World |first=Scott |last=Bryan|date= 8 March 2020 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\nThe programme was commissioned by David Brindley and Michael Jochnowitz for BBC 2.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n! scope=\"col\" | Start\n! scope=\"col\" | End\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold;\"|Winners\n! scope=\"col\" | Average UK viewers<br />(millions)\n|-\n!

Shuntelle & Michael decided to travel to the northern [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] enroute to [[Belize]]. Dom & Lizzie chose to go from [[Oaxaca City]] to [[Guatemala]] via the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast route, but visited the infinity pool at [[Hierve el Agua]] while waiting for a bus at Oaxaca City. Emon & Jamiul chose the interior route so they can see the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ruins at [[Palenque]]. Initially they had intended to go via [[Tonal\u00e1, Jalisco|Tonal\u00e1]], but found that it would involved a six hour detour, and had to changed bus half-way through. \n\nJo & Sam originally also intended to go to Belize, but modified their plan and go via Guatemala instead after a chance meeting with a stranger in [[San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas]] who advised them on the ideal route. This proved fortunate as it allowed them to reach Cop\u00e1n Ruinas first on day 6 of the race, despite stopping along the way to work for money at an organic farm in [[Antigua Guatemala]]. \n\nAt Belize, Shuntelle & Michael and Jen & Rob managed to catch the boat from [[Placencia]] to [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] in Honduras, but had to take shelter in Honduras after getting caught in [[Tropical Storm Karen (2019)|Tropical Storm Karen]] on their way to Cop\u00e1n Ruinas. Emon & Jamiul missed the boat despite taking an expensive taxi ride to Placencia and had to wait until the following day for a boat.

Although they were the first team to leave, they worked for a day at a hostel in El Cuco, El Salvador collecting turtle eggs to earn some money, which lost them their lead. In an effort to get to the front, Dom & Lizzie decided to travel non-stop in Honduras from [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] on back-to-back buses, hopping from town to town, and became the first team to cross into  [[Nicaragua]]. After stopping in [[Lim\u00f3n]], [[Costa Rica]] to work in a farm with the [[Bribri people|Bribri tribe]], they arrived at the checkpoint in [[Panama City]] first on Day 14 of the race.\n\nAs they were a long way behind, Emon & Jamiul took the faster [[Pan-American Highway#Central America|CA1 route]] via [[San Salvador]] in a attempt to make up time. They also took an expensive direct bus ride from [[Managua]] to [[David, Panama]].

To travel to Colombia, the teams needed to avoid the dangerous area of [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]], so they travelled by sea over the northern coast of Panama from [[Tupile (town)|Puerto Tupile]] to the Colombian town [[Capurgan\u00e1]].\n\nAlthough Dom & Lizzie were the first to leave, they had to stay overnight at [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] and then missed the boat from Capurgan\u00e1 to [[Necocl\u00ed]]. As the result, all the teams met up at Capurgan\u00e1, the last two teams meeting the first two while they were leaving for Necocl\u00ed by boat. Jen & Rob managed to catch the next boat, but Emon & Jamiul wrongly believed that they had missed it, and decided to stay for a day at Capurgan\u00e1 and worked at a local [[scuba-diving]] school. Fortuitously, they were advised by the locals to travel in a direct but more obscure route from [[Medell\u00edn]] to [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]]. Although they were a day behind leaving Capurgan\u00e1, this direct route helped them leap to the front, and they reached the checkpoint in the [[Tatacoa Desert]] near Villavieja first.\n\nIn order to save on accommodation cost, Jen & Rob took two night buses to reach [[Bogot\u00e1]] via Medell\u00edn. After a night in Bogot\u00e1, they took a bus to Neiva, but dropped off near Villavieja before reaching Neiva. They crossed a river to reach Villavieja and finished second.\nJo & Sam decided to take a break at Medell\u00edn to relieve the stress of travelling. They then travelled via [[Cali]] where they tried to work in a dance club La Matraca, although Sam failed to complete his work. \nDom & Lizzie took a detour to work at [[Guatap\u00e9]] before going to Bogot\u00e1. However, this detour cost them the lead, and they finished behind all the other teams.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=width:3em|Order\n!style=width:10em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders\n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ustupo]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|\u2013\n| 44%\n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Bogot\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]]  \u2192 [[Magdalena River]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|2.5\n| 57%\n|-\n|3\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cali]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|9.5\n| 54%\n|-\n| 4\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Guatap\u00e9]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]]  \u2192 [[Bogot\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n| 12\n| 53%\n|-\n|}\n\n====Leg 4: Villavieja \u2192 Puno ====\n[[File:095 Hotel Puno Peru 3366 (15119509256).jpg|thumb|Hotel in [[Puno]]]]\nDue to the continuing civil unrest in Ecuador and for safety reasons, teams were unable to travel to Peru by land or sea and were flown to the nearest airport in [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n]] in [[Peru]] to continue the race.  The teams left the Ja\u00e9n airport in the same order that they arrived in at the checkpoint in the Tatacoa Desert.  All the teams went down to the coast to travel to Peru's capital [[Lima]]. Emon & Jamiul went to [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] and they worked with fishermen for bed and board at [[Huanchaco]], while Jen & Rob went via [[Chiclayo]] to work at the Chaparri Reserve which is a sanctuary for [[spectacled bear]]. Jen & Rob again employed the strategy of travelling on a night bus to save on accommodation cost.\n\nJo & Sam and Dom & Lizzie also went to Lima via Chiclayo.  Jo & Sam chose a more expensive bus ride for greater comfort, as well as taking a break to go [[sandboarding]] in the desert oasis of [[Huacachina]] near [[Ica, Peru|Ica]], which depleted their funds. However, without stopping to work, Jo & Sam reached their destination first, which is located on an island connected to the shore of [[Lake Titicaca]] at [[Puno]].\n\nBoth Emon & Jamiul and Dom & Lizzie went from Lima to Puno via a steeper route through [[Cusco]]. Although ahead of the others, Emon & Jamiul took a detour to see the [[Vinicunca|Rainbow Mountain]]. Jen & Rob travelled in a slower but more gradual climb to Puno via [[Arequipa]]. They reached Puno at the same time as Emon & Jamiul, and beat them to the second spot at the checkpoint on Day 27. \n\nDom & Lizzie spent a night working at a bar in Cusco.

In the first series, the race started from [[London]] and finished in [[Singapore]]. The competitors cannot fly but were each given a money belt containing an amount of money equivalent to a one-way plane ticket to their final destination, which they can use to travel by land or by sea. The money pays for all the cost of the travel including food and accommodation, but they may work to earn money along the way. The competitors may not have any mobile electronic devices or credit cards at the start of the race, but were given a world map, a GPS device to track their progress and for safety as well as finding the checkpoints, and a travel guide with local job adverts, in addition to the money. In every episode, the teams were given a checkpoint they had to reach. One team may be eliminated if they come last at a pre-determined checkpoint. At each checkpoint, the racers were given a 36-hour break. The first team to reach the final destination win a cash prize of \u00a320,000.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n==Production==\nBefore the race, two assistant producers conducted a [[Recce (filmmaking)|recce]] research trip to assess the feasibility of such a journey within the budget constraints. All likely bus and train journeys were assessed beforehand. Visas were applied for the countries along all possible routes before the race as well as any necessary vaccinations for these countries.<ref name=broadcast /> \n\nDuring the race, each team had two film crew members who travelled along with them. All decisions, however, were made by the racers and the crew cannot interfere with their choices. A director of photography travelled behind the teams for additional location filming. To ensure the safety of the racers, there may be local fixers and security advisers who observed the racers from a distance, and medical support vehicle also travelled an hour behind the team in some countries.<ref name=\"bbc turner\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47827316 |title= Race Across the World: How the BBC series was made |first= Lauren |last=Turner|work=BBC News|date=6 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/08/theft-riots-and-28-hour-buses-the-secrets-of-race-across-the-world-bbc |title=Theft, riots and 28-hour buses: the secrets of Race Across the World |first=Scott |last=Bryan|date= 8 March 2020 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\nThe programme was commissioned by David Brindley and Michael Jochnowitz for BBC 2.<ref name=broadcast />\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n! scope=\"col\" | Start\n! scope=\"col\" | End\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold;\"|Winners\n! scope=\"col\" | Average UK viewers<br />(millions)\n|-\n!

This proved fortunate as it allowed them to reach Cop\u00e1n Ruinas first on day 6 of the race, despite stopping along the way to work for money at an organic farm in [[Antigua Guatemala]]. \n\nAt Belize, Shuntelle & Michael and Jen & Rob managed to catch the boat from [[Placencia]] to [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]] in Honduras, but had to take shelter in Honduras after getting caught in [[Tropical Storm Karen (2019)|Tropical Storm Karen]] on their way to Cop\u00e1n Ruinas. Emon & Jamiul missed the boat despite taking an expensive taxi ride to Placencia and had to wait until the following day for a boat.

Although they were the first team to leave, they worked for a day at a hostel in El Cuco, El Salvador collecting turtle eggs to earn some money, which lost them their lead. In an effort to get to the front, Dom & Lizzie decided to travel non-stop in Honduras from [[Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n]] on back-to-back buses, hopping from town to town, and became the first team to cross into  [[Nicaragua]]. After stopping in [[Lim\u00f3n]], [[Costa Rica]] to work in a farm with the [[Bribri people|Bribri tribe]], they arrived at the checkpoint in [[Panama City]] first on Day 14 of the race.\n\nAs they were a long way behind, Emon & Jamiul took the faster [[Pan-American Highway#Central America|CA1 route]] via [[San Salvador]] in a attempt to make up time. They also took an expensive direct bus ride from [[Managua]] to [[David, Panama]].

To travel to Colombia, the teams needed to avoid the dangerous area of [[Dari\u00e9n Gap]], so they travelled by sea over the northern coast of Panama from [[Tupile (town)|Puerto Tupile]] to the Colombian town [[Capurgan\u00e1]].\n\nAlthough Dom & Lizzie were the first to leave, they had to stay overnight at [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] and then missed the boat from Capurgan\u00e1 to [[Necocl\u00ed]]. As the result, all the teams met up at Capurgan\u00e1, the last two teams meeting the first two while they were leaving for Necocl\u00ed by boat. Jen & Rob managed to catch the next boat, but Emon & Jamiul wrongly believed that they had missed it, and decided to stay for a day at Capurgan\u00e1 and worked at a local [[scuba-diving]] school. Fortuitously, they were advised by the locals to travel in a direct but more obscure route from [[Medell\u00edn]] to [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]]. Although they were a day behind leaving Capurgan\u00e1, this direct route helped them leap to the front, and they reached the checkpoint in the [[Tatacoa Desert]] near Villavieja first.\n\nIn order to save on accommodation cost, Jen & Rob took two night buses to reach [[Bogot\u00e1]] via Medell\u00edn. After a night in Bogot\u00e1, they took a bus to Neiva, but dropped off near Villavieja before reaching Neiva. They crossed a river to reach Villavieja and finished second.\nJo & Sam decided to take a break at Medell\u00edn to relieve the stress of travelling. They then travelled via [[Cali]] where they tried to work in a dance club La Matraca, although Sam failed to complete his work. \nDom & Lizzie took a detour to work at [[Guatap\u00e9]] before going to Bogot\u00e1. However, this detour cost them the lead, and they finished behind all the other teams.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=width:3em|Order\n!style=width:10em|Teams \n!style=width:30em|Route\n!style=width:5em|Hours behind leaders\n!style=width:5em|Money left\n|-\n|1\n|style=text-align:left|Emon & Jamiul\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ustupo]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|\u2013\n| 44%\n|-\n|2\n|style=text-align:left|Jen & Rob\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Bogot\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]]  \u2192 [[Magdalena River]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|2.5\n| 57%\n|-\n|3\n|style=text-align:left|Jo & Sam\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:High-contrast-camera-photo.svg|22px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Cali]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n|9.5\n| 54%\n|-\n| 4\n|style=text-align:left|Dom & Lizzie\n|style=text-align:left|[[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tupile (town)|Tupile]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Ukupseni|Play\u00f3n Chico]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Capurgan\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA F\u00e4hre(R).svg|30px]] \u2192 [[Necocl\u00ed]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Medell\u00edn]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Guatap\u00e9]] [[File:Font Awesome 5 solid pound-sign.svg|10px]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]]  \u2192 [[Bogot\u00e1]] [[File:RWBA Bus.svg|27px]] \u2192 [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] [[File:Taxi Icon.png|20px]] \u2192 [[Tatacoa Desert]]\n| 12\n| 53%\n|-\n|}\n\n====Leg 4: Villavieja \u2192 Puno ====\n[[File:095 Hotel Puno Peru 3366 (15119509256).jpg|thumb|Hotel in [[Puno]]]]\nDue to the continuing civil unrest in Ecuador and for safety reasons, teams were unable to travel to Peru by land or sea and were flown to the nearest airport in [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n]] in [[Peru]] to continue the race.  The teams left the Ja\u00e9n airport in the same order that they arrived in at the checkpoint in the Tatacoa Desert.  All the teams went down to the coast to travel to Peru's capital [[Lima]]. Emon & Jamiul went to [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] and they worked with fishermen for bed and board at [[Huanchaco]], while Jen & Rob went via [[Chiclayo]] to work at the Chaparri Reserve which is a sanctuary for [[spectacled bear]]. Jen & Rob again employed the strategy of travelling on a night bus to save on accommodation cost.\n\nJo & Sam and Dom & Lizzie also went to Lima via Chiclayo.  Jo & Sam chose a more expensive bus ride for greater comfort, as well as taking a break to go [[sandboarding]] in the desert oasis of [[Huacachina]] near [[Ica, Peru|Ica]], which depleted their funds. However, without stopping to work, Jo & Sam reached their destination first, which is located on an island connected to the shore of [[Lake Titicaca]] at [[Puno]].\n\nBoth Emon & Jamiul and Dom & Lizzie went from Lima to Puno via a steeper route through [[Cusco]]. Although ahead of the others, Emon & Jamiul took a detour to see the [[Vinicunca|Rainbow Mountain]]. Jen & Rob travelled in a slower but more gradual climb to Puno via [[Arequipa]]. They reached Puno at the same time as Emon & Jamiul, and beat them to the second spot at the checkpoint on Day 27. \n\nDom & Lizzie spent a night working at a bar in Cusco.
