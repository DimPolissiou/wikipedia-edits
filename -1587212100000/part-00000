Systems such as '''S''' are referred to as 1-[[qubit]] systems.]] -->\nIn Everett's formulation, a measuring apparatus '''M''' and an object system '''S''' form a composite system, each of which prior to measurement exists in well-defined (but time-dependent) states. Measurement is regarded as causing '''M''' and '''S''' to interact. After '''S''' interacts with '''M''', it is no longer possible to describe either system by an independent state. According to Everett, the only meaningful descriptions of each system are relative states: for example the relative state of '''S''' given the state of '''M''' or the relative state of '''M''' given the state of '''S'''. In DeWitt's formulation, the state of '''S''' after a sequence of measurements is given by a quantum superposition of states, each one corresponding to an alternative measurement history of '''S'''.\n\n[[Image:Splittings-1.png|thumb|left|350px|Schematic illustration of splitting as a result of a repeated measurement.]]\nFor example, consider the smallest possible truly quantum system '''S''', as shown in the illustration. This describes for instance, the spin-state of an electron. Considering a specific axis (say the ''z''-axis) the north pole represents spin \"up\" and the south pole, spin \"down\". The superposition states of the system are described by a sphere called the [[Bloch sphere]]. To perform a measurement on '''S''', it is made to interact with another similar system '''M'''. After the interaction, the combined system can be regarded as a quantum superposition of two \"alternative histories\" of the original system '''S''', one in which \"up\" was observed and the other in which \"down\" was observed. Each subsequent binary measurement (that is interaction with a system '''M''') causes a similar split in the history tree. Thus after three measurements, the system can be regarded as a quantum superposition of 8 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 copies of the original system '''S'''.\n\n===Relative state===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nIn his 1957 doctoral dissertation, Everett proposed that rather than modeling an isolated quantum system subject to external observation, one could mathematically model an object as well as its observers as purely physical systems within the mathematical framework developed by [[Paul Dirac]], [[John von Neumann]] and others, discarding altogether the ''ad hoc'' mechanism of [[wave function collapse]].\n\nSince Everett's original work, a number of similar formalisms have appeared in the literature. One is the relative state formulation. It makes two assumptions: first, the wavefunction is not simply a description of the object's state, but is entirely equivalent to the object\u2014a claim it has in common with some other interpretations. Second, observation or measurement has no special laws or mechanics, unlike in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], which considers the wavefunction collapse a special kind of event that occurs as a result of observation. Instead, measurement in the relative state formulation is the consequence of a configuration change in an observer's memory described by the same basic wave physics as the object being modeled.\n\nThe many-worlds interpretation is DeWitt's popularisation of Everett, who had referred to the combined observer\u2013object system as split by an observation, each split corresponding to the different or multiple possible outcomes of an observation. These splits generate a tree, as shown in the graphic above. Subsequently, DeWitt introduced the term \"world\" to describe a complete measurement history of an observer, which corresponds roughly to a single branch of that tree.\n\nUnder the many-worlds interpretation, the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], or relativistic analog, holds all the time everywhere. An observation or measurement is modeled by applying the wave equation to the entire system comprising the observer ''and'' the object. One consequence is that every observation can be thought of as causing the combined observer\u2013object's wavefunction to change into a quantum superposition of two or more non-interacting branches, or split into many \"worlds\". Since many observation-like events have happened and are constantly happening, there are an enormous and growing number of simultaneously existing states.\n\nIf a system is composed of two or more subsystems, the system's state will be a superposition of products of the subsystems' states. Each product of subsystem states in the overall superposition evolves over time independently of other products. Once the subsystems interact, their states have become correlated or [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] and can no longer be considered independent. In Everett's terminology each subsystem state was now ''correlated'' with its ''relative state'', since each subsystem must now be considered relative to the other subsystems with which it has interacted.\n\n===Properties===\n\nMWI removes the observer-dependent role in the [[quantum measurement]] process by replacing [[wavefunction collapse]] with [[quantum decoherence]].{{cn|date=March 2020}} Since the observer's role lies at the heart of most if not all \"quantum paradoxes,\" this automatically resolves a number of problems, such as [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], the [[EPR paradox]], von Neumann's \"boundary problem\", and even [[wave-particle duality]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nSince the Copenhagen interpretation requires the existence of a classical domain beyond the one described by quantum mechanics, it has been criticized as inadequate for the study of cosmology.<ref name=\"gell-man1990\"/> MWI was developed with the explicit goal of allowing quantum mechanics to be applied to the universe as a whole, making [[quantum cosmology]] possible.<ref name=everett57/>\n\nMWI is a [[philosophical realism|realist]], [[deterministic]], and [[principle of locality|local]] theory.

When [[photon|particles of light]] (or anything else) pass through the double slit, a calculation assuming wavelike behavior of light can be used to identify where the particles are likely to be observed. Yet when the particles are observed in this experiment, they appear as particles (i.e., at definite places) and not as non-localized waves.\n\nSome versions of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics proposed a process of \"[[wavefunction collapse|collapse]]\" in which an indeterminate quantum system would probabilistically collapse down onto, or select, just one determinate outcome to \"explain\" this phenomenon of observation. Wavefunction collapse was widely regarded as artificial and ''[[ad hoc]]''<ref>Wimmel Hermann. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I63sCgAAQBAJ Quantum Physics And Observed Reality: A Critical Interpretation Of Quantum Mechanics], p.45, World Scientific, May 26, 1992</ref>, so an alternative interpretation in which the behavior of measurement could be understood from more fundamental physical principles was considered desirable.\n\nEverett's Ph.D. work provided such an interpretation. He argued that for a composite system\u2014such as a subject (the \"observer\" or measuring apparatus) observing an object (the \"observed\" system, such as a particle)\u2014the claim that either the observer or the observed has a well-defined state is meaningless; in modern parlance, the observer and the observed have become entangled: we can only specify the state of one ''relative'' to the other, i.e., the state of the observer and the observed are correlated ''after'' the observation is made. This led Everett to derive from the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone (i.e., without assuming wavefunction collapse) the notion of a ''relativity of states''.\n\nEverett noticed that the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone entailed that after an observation is made each element of the [[quantum superposition]] of the combined subject\u2013object wavefunction contains two \"relative states\": a \"collapsed\" object state and an associated observer who has observed the same collapsed outcome; what the observer sees and the state of the object have become correlated by the act of measurement or observation. The subsequent evolution of each pair of relative subject\u2013object states proceeds with complete indifference as to the presence or absence of the other elements, ''as if'' wavefunction collapse has occurred, which has the consequence that later observations are always consistent with the earlier observations. Thus the ''appearance'' of the object's wavefunction's collapse has emerged from the unitary, deterministic theory itself. (This answered Einstein's early criticism of quantum theory, that the theory should define what is observed, not for the observables to define the theory.{{efn|\"Whether you can observe a thing or not depends on the theory which you use. It is the theory which decides what can be observed.\"\u2014[[Albert Einstein]] to [[Werner Heisenberg]], objecting to placing observables at the heart of the new quantum mechanics, during Heisenberg's 1926 lecture at Berlin; related by Heisenberg in 1968.<ref name=\"einstein26\"> [[Abdus Salam]], ''Unification of Fundamental Forces'', Cambridge University Press (1990) {{ISBN|0-521-37140-6}}, pp 98\u2013101</ref>}}) Since the wavefunction merely appears to have collapsed then, Everett reasoned, there was no need to actually assume that it had collapsed. And so, invoking [[Occam's razor]], he removed the postulate of wavefunction collapse from the theory.\n\n===Testability===\n\nIn 1985, David Deutsch proposed a variant of the [[Wigner's friend]] thought experiment as a test of many-worlds versus the Copenhagen interpretation.<ref name=\"deutsch1985\">{{cite journal|last=Deutsch |first=D. |authorlink=David Deutsch |year=1985 |title=Quantum theory as a universal physical theory |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=24 |number=1 |pages=1\u201341 |doi=10.1007/BF00670071 |bibcode=1985IJTP...24....1D}}</ref> It consists of an experimenter (Wigner's friend) making a measurement on a quantum system in an isolated laboratory, and another experimenter (Wigner) who would make a measurement on the first one. According to the many-worlds theory, the first experimenter would end up in a macroscopic superposition of seeing one result of the measurement in one branch, and another result in another branch. The second experimenter could then interfere these two branches in order to test whether it is in fact in a macroscopic superposition or has collapsed into a single branch, as predicted by the Copenhagen interpretation. Since then Lockwood (1989), Vaidman and others have made similar proposals.<ref name=\"vaidman_stanfordencyclopedia\">{{cite book |last=Vaidman |first=Lev |title=Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/ |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2018 }}</ref> These proposals require placing macroscopic objects in a coherent superposition and interfering them, a task now beyond experimental capability.\n\n==Probability and the Born rule==\n\nSince the many-worlds interpretation's inception, physicists have been puzzled about the role of probability in it. As put by Wallace, there are two facets to the question:<ref name=\"wallace2003\"/> the ''incoherence problem'', which asks why should we assign probabilities at all to outcomes that are certain to occur in some worlds, and the ''quantitative problem'', which asks why the probabilities should be given by the [[Born rule]]. \n\nEverett tried to answer these questions in the paper that introduced many-worlds. To address the incoherence problem, he argued that an observer who makes a sequence of measurements on a quantum system will in general have an apparently random sequence of results in their memory, which justifies the use of probabilities to describe the measurement process.<ref name=everett56/>{{rp|69-70}} To address the quantitative problem, Everett proposed a derivation of the Born rule based on the properties that a measure on the branches of the wavefunction should have.<ref name=everett56/>{{rp|70-72}} His derivation has been criticized as relying on unmotivated assumptions.<ref name=ballentine1973>{{cite journal |author1=L.

Without this the theory was ambiguous, as a quantum state can be equally well be described (e.g.) as having a well-defined position, or as being a superposition of two delocalised states. The assumption that the preferred basis to use is the one from a measurement of position results in worlds having objects in well-defined positions, instead of worlds with delocalised objects (which would be grossly incompatible with experiment). This special role for measurements is problematic for the theory, as it contradicts Everett and DeWitt's goal of having a reductionist theory and undermines their criticism of the ill-defined measurement postulate of the Copenhagen interpretation.<ref name=ballentine1973/><ref name=skyrms1976>{{cite journal |author1=Brian Skyrms |authorlink1=Brian Skyrms |title=Possible Worlds, Physics and Metaphysics |journal=Philosophical Studies |date=1976 |volume=30 |pages=323\u2013332 |doi=10.1007/BF00357930}}</ref> This is known today as the ''preferred basis problem''.\n\nThe preferred basis problem has been solved, according to Saunders and Wallace, among others,<ref name=saunders2010>{{Cite book|last1=Saunders|first1=Simon|chapter=Many Worlds?

Systems such as '''S''' are referred to as 1-[[qubit]] systems.]] -->\nIn Everett's formulation, a measuring apparatus '''M''' and an object system '''S''' form a composite system, each of which prior to measurement exists in well-defined (but time-dependent) states. Measurement is regarded as causing '''M''' and '''S''' to interact. After '''S''' interacts with '''M''', it is no longer possible to describe either system by an independent state. According to Everett, the only meaningful descriptions of each system are relative states: for example the relative state of '''S''' given the state of '''M''' or the relative state of '''M''' given the state of '''S'''. In DeWitt's formulation, the state of '''S''' after a sequence of measurements is given by a quantum superposition of states, each one corresponding to an alternative measurement history of '''S'''.\n\n[[Image:Splittings-1.png|thumb|left|350px|Schematic illustration of splitting as a result of a repeated measurement.]]\nFor example, consider the smallest possible truly quantum system '''S''', as shown in the illustration. This describes for instance, the spin-state of an electron. Considering a specific axis (say the ''z''-axis) the north pole represents spin \"up\" and the south pole, spin \"down\". The superposition states of the system are described by a sphere called the [[Bloch sphere]]. To perform a measurement on '''S''', it is made to interact with another similar system '''M'''. After the interaction, the combined system can be regarded as a quantum superposition of two \"alternative histories\" of the original system '''S''', one in which \"up\" was observed and the other in which \"down\" was observed. Each subsequent binary measurement (that is interaction with a system '''M''') causes a similar split in the history tree. Thus after three measurements, the system can be regarded as a quantum superposition of 8 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 copies of the original system '''S'''.\n\n===Relative state===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nIn his 1957 doctoral dissertation, Everett proposed that rather than modeling an isolated quantum system subject to external observation, one could mathematically model an object as well as its observers as purely physical systems within the mathematical framework developed by [[Paul Dirac]], [[John von Neumann]] and others, discarding altogether the ''ad hoc'' mechanism of [[wave function collapse]].\n\nSince Everett's original work, a number of similar formalisms have appeared in the literature. One is the relative state formulation. It makes two assumptions: first, the wavefunction is not simply a description of the object's state, but is entirely equivalent to the object\u2014a claim it has in common with some other interpretations. Second, observation or measurement has no special laws or mechanics, unlike in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], which considers the wavefunction collapse a special kind of event that occurs as a result of observation. Instead, measurement in the relative state formulation is the consequence of a configuration change in an observer's memory described by the same basic wave physics as the object being modeled.\n\nThe many-worlds interpretation is DeWitt's popularisation of Everett, who had referred to the combined observer\u2013object system as split by an observation, each split corresponding to the different or multiple possible outcomes of an observation. These splits generate a tree, as shown in the graphic above. Subsequently, DeWitt introduced the term \"world\" to describe a complete measurement history of an observer, which corresponds roughly to a single branch of that tree.\n\nUnder the many-worlds interpretation, the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], or relativistic analog, holds all the time everywhere. An observation or measurement is modeled by applying the wave equation to the entire system comprising the observer ''and'' the object. One consequence is that every observation can be thought of as causing the combined observer\u2013object's wavefunction to change into a quantum superposition of two or more non-interacting branches, or split into many \"worlds\". Since many observation-like events have happened and are constantly happening, there are an enormous and growing number of simultaneously existing states.\n\nIf a system is composed of two or more subsystems, the system's state will be a superposition of products of the subsystems' states. Each product of subsystem states in the overall superposition evolves over time independently of other products. Once the subsystems interact, their states have become correlated or [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] and can no longer be considered independent. In Everett's terminology each subsystem state was now ''correlated'' with its ''relative state'', since each subsystem must now be considered relative to the other subsystems with which it has interacted.\n\n===Properties===\n\nMWI removes the observer-dependent role in the [[quantum measurement]] process by replacing [[wavefunction collapse]] with [[quantum decoherence]].{{cn|date=March 2020}} Since the observer's role lies at the heart of most if not all \"quantum paradoxes,\" this automatically resolves a number of problems, such as [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], the [[EPR paradox]], von Neumann's \"boundary problem\", and even [[wave-particle duality]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nSince the Copenhagen interpretation requires the existence of a classical domain beyond the one described by quantum mechanics, it has been criticized as inadequate for the study of cosmology.<ref name=\"gell-man1990\"/> MWI was developed with the explicit goal of allowing quantum mechanics to be applied to the universe as a whole, making [[quantum cosmology]] possible.<ref name=everett57/>\n\nMWI is a [[philosophical realism|realist]], [[deterministic]], and [[principle of locality|local]] theory.

When [[photon|particles of light]] (or anything else) pass through the double slit, a calculation assuming wavelike behavior of light can be used to identify where the particles are likely to be observed. Yet when the particles are observed in this experiment, they appear as particles (i.e., at definite places) and not as non-localized waves.\n\nSome versions of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics proposed a process of \"[[wavefunction collapse|collapse]]\" in which an indeterminate quantum system would probabilistically collapse down onto, or select, just one determinate outcome to \"explain\" this phenomenon of observation. Wavefunction collapse was widely regarded as artificial and ''[[ad hoc]]''<ref>Wimmel Hermann. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I63sCgAAQBAJ Quantum Physics And Observed Reality: A Critical Interpretation Of Quantum Mechanics], p.45, World Scientific, May 26, 1992</ref>, so an alternative interpretation in which the behavior of measurement could be understood from more fundamental physical principles was considered desirable.\n\nEverett's Ph.D. work provided such an interpretation. He argued that for a composite system\u2014such as a subject (the \"observer\" or measuring apparatus) observing an object (the \"observed\" system, such as a particle)\u2014the claim that either the observer or the observed has a well-defined state is meaningless; in modern parlance, the observer and the observed have become entangled: we can only specify the state of one ''relative'' to the other, i.e., the state of the observer and the observed are correlated ''after'' the observation is made. This led Everett to derive from the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone (i.e., without assuming wavefunction collapse) the notion of a ''relativity of states''.\n\nEverett noticed that the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone entailed that after an observation is made each element of the [[quantum superposition]] of the combined subject\u2013object wavefunction contains two \"relative states\": a \"collapsed\" object state and an associated observer who has observed the same collapsed outcome; what the observer sees and the state of the object have become correlated by the act of measurement or observation. The subsequent evolution of each pair of relative subject\u2013object states proceeds with complete indifference as to the presence or absence of the other elements, ''as if'' wavefunction collapse has occurred, which has the consequence that later observations are always consistent with the earlier observations. Thus the ''appearance'' of the object's wavefunction's collapse has emerged from the unitary, deterministic theory itself. (This answered Einstein's early criticism of quantum theory, that the theory should define what is observed, not for the observables to define the theory.{{efn|\"Whether you can observe a thing or not depends on the theory which you use. It is the theory which decides what can be observed.\"\u2014[[Albert Einstein]] to [[Werner Heisenberg]], objecting to placing observables at the heart of the new quantum mechanics, during Heisenberg's 1926 lecture at Berlin; related by Heisenberg in 1968.<ref name=\"einstein26\"> [[Abdus Salam]], ''Unification of Fundamental Forces'', Cambridge University Press (1990) {{ISBN|0-521-37140-6}}, pp 98\u2013101</ref>}}) Since the wavefunction merely appears to have collapsed then, Everett reasoned, there was no need to actually assume that it had collapsed. And so, invoking [[Occam's razor]], he removed the postulate of wavefunction collapse from the theory.\n\n===Testability===\n\nIn 1985, David Deutsch proposed a variant of the [[Wigner's friend]] thought experiment as a test of many-worlds versus the Copenhagen interpretation.<ref name=\"deutsch1985\">{{cite journal|last=Deutsch |first=D. |authorlink=David Deutsch |year=1985 |title=Quantum theory as a universal physical theory |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=24 |number=1 |pages=1\u201341 |doi=10.1007/BF00670071 |bibcode=1985IJTP...24....1D}}</ref> It consists of an experimenter (Wigner's friend) making a measurement on a quantum system in an isolated laboratory, and another experimenter (Wigner) who would make a measurement on the first one. According to the many-worlds theory, the first experimenter would end up in a macroscopic superposition of seeing one result of the measurement in one branch, and another result in another branch. The second experimenter could then interfere these two branches in order to test whether it is in fact in a macroscopic superposition or has collapsed into a single branch, as predicted by the Copenhagen interpretation. Since then Lockwood (1989), Vaidman and others have made similar proposals.<ref name=\"vaidman_stanfordencyclopedia\">{{cite book |last=Vaidman |first=Lev |title=Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/ |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2018 }}</ref> These proposals require placing macroscopic objects in a coherent superposition and interfering them, a task now beyond experimental capability.\n\n==Probability and the Born rule==\n\nSince the the many-worlds interpretation's inception, physicists have been puzzled about the role of probability in it. As put by Wallace, there are two facets to the question:<ref name=\"wallace2003\"/> the ''incoherence problem'', which asks why should we assign probabilities at all to outcomes that are certain to occur in some worlds, and the ''quantitative problem'', which asks why the probabilities should be given by the [[Born rule]]. \n\nEverett tried to answer these questions in the paper that introduced many-worlds. To address the incoherence problem, he argued that an observer who makes a sequence of measurements on a quantum system will in general have an apparently random sequence of results in their memory, which justifies the use of probabilities to describe the measurement process.<ref name=everett56/>{{rp|69-70}} To address the quantitative problem, Everett proposed a derivation of the Born rule based on the properties that a measure on the branches of the wavefunction should have.<ref name=everett56/>{{rp|70-72}} His derivation has been criticized as relying on unmotivated assumptions.<ref name=ballentine1973>{{cite journal |author1=L.

Without this the theory was ambiguous, as a quantum state can be equally well be described (e.g.) as having a well-defined position, or as being a superposition of two delocalised states. The assumption that the preferred basis to use is the one from a measurement of position results in worlds having objects in well-defined positions, instead of worlds with delocalised objects (which would be grossly incompatible with experiment). This special role for measurements is problematic for the theory, as it contradicts Everett and DeWitt's goal of having a reductionist theory and undermines their criticism of the ill-defined measurement postulate of the Copenhagen interpretation.<ref name=ballentine1973/><ref name=skyrms1976>{{cite journal |author1=Brian Skyrms |authorlink1=Brian Skyrms |title=Possible Worlds, Physics and Metaphysics |journal=Philosophical Studies |date=1976 |volume=30 |pages=323\u2013332 |doi=10.1007/BF00357930}}</ref> This is known today as the ''preferred basis problem''.\n\nThe preferred basis problem has been solved, according to Saunders and Wallace, among others,<ref name=saunders2010>{{Cite book|last1=Saunders|first1=Simon|chapter=Many Worlds?

Should this proposal be accepted, [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] will be awarded the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/belgiums-pro-league-cancelled-and-club-brugge-declared-champions-/1te7euvc2td4k1rtsjj9zq410e|title=Belgium's Pro League cancelled and Club Brugge set to be declared champions due to coronavirus|last=Smith|first=Emma|publisher=Goal.com|date=2020-04-02|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> In the meantime UEFA has threatened to ban teams in Europe in case their respective leagues were terminated early without trying to have all remaining matches completed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/uefa-threatens-belgian-league-european-135211851.html|title=UEFA threatens Belgian league with European expulsion|work=Sports.yahoo.com|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Team changes==\nTheoretically, [[2018\u201319 Belgian First Division B]] champions [[KV Mechelen|Mechelen]] would have replaced relegated [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|Lokeren]]. However, as part of the [[2017\u201319 Belgian football fraud scandal]], Mechelen were found guilty of match-fixing at the end of the [[2017\u201318 Belgian First Division A|2017\u201318 season]], resulting in the club being relegated back to the First Division B and runners-up [[K Beerschot VA|Beerschot]] taking the spot of Mechelen instead. Mechelen appealed the decision with the Belgian Court of Arbitration for Sports, which confirmed that KV Mechelen was indeed guilty of match-fixing, but that according to the rules of the [[Royal Belgian Football Association]], relegation is no longer a possible penalty as the match-fixing occurred more that one season ago. KV Mechelen was thus allowed to play in the Belgian First Division A, but did get banned from participating in the UEFA Europa League and the Belgian Cup for one season.\n\n==Format change==\nWhile the regular season remains unchanged, the end of season play-offs have been altered somewhat, specifically the Europa League play-offs will now be played by 16 instead of 12 teams. Taking part will be the bottom ten teams together with the six top teams from the Belgian First Division B, to be divided in four groups of four teams. The four group winners will play semi-finals and a final to determine the team which will play the fourth (or fifth) placed team from the championship play-offs for the remaining ticket into the UEFA Europa League. This change allows both the team relegating from the [[2019\u201320 Belgian First Division A]] and the [[2019\u201320 Belgian First Division B]] champion to take part in the Europa League play-offs, allowing these teams to bridge the gap of nearly six months without any matches as used to be the case in previous seasons.<ref name=\"po2\">{{cite web |url=https://sporza.be/artikels/pro-league-heeft-beslist-play-off-i-blijft-ongewijzigd-play-off-ii-met-16-clubs~1559925221011/|title=Pro League heeft beslist: Play-off I blijft ongewijzigd, Play-off II met 16 clubs|trans-title=Pro League has decided: Play-off I remains unchanged, Play-off II with 16 clubs |work=sporza.be|accessdate=7 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Teams==\n===Stadiums and locations===\n{{location map+|Belgium|float=right|width=450|caption=Locations of the '''2019\u201320 Belgian First Division A''' teams|places=\n{{location map~|Belgium|lat=50.833333 |long=4.333333 |label=<div style=\"font-size:80%;\">[[R.S.C.

Should this proposal be accepted, [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] will be awarded the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/belgiums-pro-league-cancelled-and-club-brugge-declared-champions-/1te7euvc2td4k1rtsjj9zq410e|title=Belgium's Pro League cancelled and Club Brugge set to be declared champions due to coronavirus|last=Smith|first=Emma|publisher=Goal.com|date=2020-04-02|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> In the meantime UEFA has threatened to ban teams in Europe in case their respective leagues were terminated early without trying to have all remaining matches completed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/uefa-threatens-belgian-league-european-135211851.html|title=UEFA threatens Belgian league with European expulsion|work=Sports.yahoo.com|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Team changes==\nTheoretically, [[2018\u201319 Belgian First Division B]] champions [[KV Mechelen|Mechelen]] would have replaced relegated [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|Lokeren]]. However, as part of the [[2017\u201319 Belgian football fraud scandal]], Mechelen were found guilty of match-fixing at the end of the [[2017\u201318 Belgian First Division A|2017\u201318 season]], resulting in the club being relegated back to the First Division B and runners-up [[K Beerschot VA|Beerschot]] taking the spot of Mechelen instead. Mechelen appealed the decision with the Belgian Court of Arbitration for Sports, which confirmed that KV Mechelen was indeed guilty of match-fixing, but that according to the rules of the [[Royal Belgian Football Association]], relegation is no longer a possible penalty as the match-fixing occurred more that one season ago. KV Mechelen was thus allowed to play in the Belgian First Division A, but did get banned from participating in the UEFA Europa League and the Belgian Cup for one season.\n\n==Format change==\nWhile the regular season remains unchanged, the end of season play-offs have been altered somewhat, specifically the Europa League play-offs will now be played by 16 instead of 12 teams. Taking part will be the bottom ten teams together with the six top teams from the Belgian First Division B, to be divided in four groups of four teams. The four group winners will play semi-finals and a final to determine the team which will play the fourth (or fifth) placed team from the championship play-offs for the remaining ticket into the UEFA Europa League. This change allows both the team relegating from the [[2019\u201320 Belgian First Division A]] and the [[2019\u201320 Belgian First Division B]] champion to take part in the Europa League play-offs, allowing these teams to bridge the gap of nearly six months without any matches as used to be the case in previous seasons.<ref name=\"po2\">{{cite web |url=https://sporza.be/artikels/pro-league-heeft-beslist-play-off-i-blijft-ongewijzigd-play-off-ii-met-16-clubs~1559925221011/|title=Pro League heeft beslist: Play-off I blijft ongewijzigd, Play-off II met 16 clubs|trans-title=Pro League has decided: Play-off I remains unchanged, Play-off II with 16 clubs |work=sporza.be|accessdate=7 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Teams==\n===Stadiums and locations===\n{{location map+|Belgium|float=right|width=450|caption=Locations of the '''2019\u201320 Belgian First Division A''' teams|places=\n{{location map~|Belgium|lat=50.833333 |long=4.333333 |label=<div style=\"font-size:80%;\">[[R.S.C.

Many efforts, including [[education reform]], [[children's rights]], and [[Reform movement|government reform]] call on youth to participate this way, often called [[youth voice]]. [[Youth council]]s are an example of this.<ref>Chawla, L. (2002) Growing Up in an Urbanizing World. Paris/London: Earthscan/UNESCO Publishing.{{Page needed|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\nYouth-driven activism requires young people to be the primary movers within an adult-led movement. Such is the case with the Sierra Club, where youth compel their peers to join and become active in the environmental movement. This is also true of many organizations that were founded by youth who became adults, such as [[Student Environmental Action Coalition|SEAC]] and [[National Youth Rights Association]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nPolitical activism by youth can go unnoticed because youth activism often occurs on school grounds and away from the adult society, but youth often face resistance when forming youth activist groups in schools.<ref name=\"Gordon, H. 2010\">Gordon, H.

When teachers started instructing in [[Afrikaans]], the language of their oppressors, children took the streets for a peaceful demonstration. The police reaction was brutal and on June 16, 1976, at least 25 people were killed. The violence continued and spread all across the country. By the end of the year, 575 people had died and 2,389 had been wounded.<ref name=\"Youth Activism: Volume 2\" />\n\nA contemporary challenge for [[South Africa]]n youth is the AIDS pandemic. Around 60% of adults who contract HIV become infected before they turn 25, meaning youth are particularly endangered.

The movement, led by [[All Assam Students Union]](AASU) and the 'All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad' (AAGSP), developed a program of protests and demonstration to compel the [[Indian government]] to identify and expel illegal, (mostly [[Bangladeshis]]), immigrants and protect and provide constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to the indigenous [[Assamese people]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Historical Background of Youth Activism in Assam|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/194323/8/08_chapter%203.pdf|journal=Shodhganga|pages=60}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Role of the Student of Assam Since Independence|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/67807/14/14_chapter%205.pdf|journal=Shodhganga}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Origin, Growth & Activities of AASU|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/67057/7/07_chapter%202.pdf|journal=Shodhganga}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Impact of AASU on Assam Politics|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/67057/11/11_chapter%206.pdf|journal=Shodhganga}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Youth Activism and Democratic Politics in India's Northeast-2014 Election in Perspective|url=https://www.thehinducentre.com/migration_catalog/article22982380.ece/BINARY/Policy%20Report%20No.14|journal=The Hindu Centre for Politics & Public Policy}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 January 2017 a large group of students (more than 20 lakhs) protested in [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Puducherry]] for the ban on [[Jallikattu]].

Popular motivations of youth activism in Indonesia are indigenous rights and national unity, pro-communism, anticommunism, pro-democracy and militant Islam. A common form of activism is massa, a cavalcade of motorcycles, trucks, music, and many young people on foot. These cavalcades are mostly males and end with a rally to address a certain political issue. In general, youth have been looking for political change during the last four decades.<ref name=\"Youth Activism: Encyclopedia\" />\n\n==== Malaysia ====\nVideo blogging has become increasing popular in Malaysia. Youth activists upload their videos and independent films to the popular site [[EngageMedia]]. This is used by Malaysians to encourage young people to become citizen journalists. Youth view EngageMedia as a safe space for their video blogs, but there is still fear of retribution.<ref name=\"Lim, J. 2013\" />\n\n====Nepal====\nThe 1979 student protests in Nepal were a series of protests amongst the student community in Nepal during the months of April and May 1979. The clashes that occurred had a significant historical impact, as they forced the monarchy to concede to holding a referendum on the possibility of a multiparty system in the country. Official figures stated that 11 persons were killed during the agitation, and 164 wounded.\n\nYouth and Student organisations such as Nepal Student Union, ANNFSU and Nepal Tarun Dal are key forces behind protests and demonstration against authoritarian governments. Youths have been standing in the forefront in 1951, 1980, 1990 and 2005 democratic movements.\n\n====The Philippines====\nYouth activism has had a long history in the Philippines. The original founding members of the [[Katipunan]] as well as the [[Propaganda Movement]] consisted of youths. The country's national hero, [[Jose Rizal]] was martyred at the ripe age of 35. In 1964, aiming to continue the revolutionary tradition of the Katipunan, the [[Kabataang Makabayan]] was formed against the Marcos regime. It became an underground organization in 1972 after the declaration of Martial Law but continues to organize in this manner. Other organizations campaigned against the Martial Law as well, such as LFS, NUSP and SCMP. The League of Filipino Students was formed in September 11, 1977 as an alliance against tuition fee increases. Eventually it became a mass organization of students campaigning against the fascist dictatorship. Around the 60s, the NUSP dominated the scene of student activism and aided in the various student council mobilizations across the country. In 1960, the Student Christian Movement of the Philippines was formed, rallying thousands of church youth against the Marcos regime. In 1997, leaders from these organizations would eventually form ANAKBAYAN, a comprehensive mass organization of the Filipino youth, turning to combine both organizing students and community youth.\n\n==== Singapore ====\nSingapore is one of the most developed information and communication technology (ICT) countries in the world. In 2010 the computer ownership rate was 84 percent, with internet access at 78 percent. In 2009, mobile phone penetration reached 137 percent, meaning many people of Singapore have access to more than one phone.<ref name=\"Zhang, W. 2013\">Zhang, W. (2013).

In the 2011 general election, people between the ages of 21 and 34 were more active in online politics. Youth who wrote about elections on blogs, Facebook or Twitter were at 28 percent, while the general public were only 10 percent.<ref name=\"Zhang, W. 2013\"/>\n\n===Middle East===\n\n==== Egypt ====\nYouth proved to be central to the Egyptian Revolution and the [[April 6 Movement]].\n\n==== Iran ====\nYoung adults in Iran defy the official regime's cultural and political policies through engaging in prohibited activities in places like taxi rides, coffee shops, and basements. Such actions re-imagine Iranian reality in ways that contest regime policies.<ref>Khosravi, S.  2008. Young and Defiant in Tehran.  University of Pennsylvania Press, pp. 169-170, 174</ref>\n\n==== Saudi Arabia ====\nYouth citizens of [[Saudi Arabia]] seek quiet forms of resistance because outright activism is prohibited. Students blog to share viewpoints and feelings despite potential personal risk.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ahmari|first=Sohrab|authorlink=Sohrab Ahmari|title=Arab Spring Dreams: The Next Generation Speaks Out for Freedom and Justice from North Africa to Iran|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, 2012}}{{Page needed|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n\n==== Serbia ====\nThroughout the 1900s, youth took to the streets to protest against Serbian leader [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]. Youth activists were credited with contributing to his resignation. During the years of protests youth faced unemployment, a failing education system, and economic instability. They created the [[Exit festival|Exit]] music festival, which lasted one hundred days and led up to the September 2000 elections. The first year this festival was called [[EXIT festival#Exit 00|EXIT 00]] and has been defined as \"creative\" and \"politically savvy\" activism. The festival contained a civic education component and continues today.<ref name=\"Youth Activism: Encyclopedia\" />\n\n===North America===\n\n==== United States ====\nYouth activism as a social phenomenon in the United States truly became defined in the mid- to late-nineteenth century when young people began forming labor strikes in response to their working conditions, wages, and hours. [[Mary Harris Jones|Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones]] organized the first youth activism in the U.S., marching 100,000 child miners from the coal mines of [[Pennsylvania]] to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. in 1908. Youth newspaper carriers soon followed. These actions isolated youths' interests in the [[popular media]] of the times, and separated young people from their contemporary adult labor counterparts.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} This separation continued through the 1930s, when the [[American Youth Congress]] presented a \"Bill of Youth Rights\" to the US Congress. Their actions were indicative of a growing student movement present throughout the US from the 1920s through the early 1940s. The 1950s saw the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] bring young people into larger movements for [[civil rights]]. All the way back in 1959, Rev. Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] engaged youth activists in protesting against [[Bull Connor]]'s racist law enforcement practices in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].  The youth activism of [[Tom Hayden]], [[Keith Hefner (activist)|Keith Hefner]] and other 1960s youth laid a powerful precedent for modern youth activism. [[John Caldwell Holt|John Holt]], [[Myles Horton]] and [[Paulo Freire]] were important in this period. Youthful life and expression defined this era.\n[[File:Climate Change Activist .jpg|thumb|The image is from a climate change protest in Helsinki, Finland in 2019. The sign the young activist holds reads \"change the politics not the climate\", a powerful message to those in power.]]\n\n== Highlights of youth activism in the U.S. throughout the 21st century ==\nYouth activism continues to take place in the 21st century at local, regional, national, and international levels. Youth activists today use technology and social media such as; [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and [[TikTok|Tiktok]] to create a focal point on oppression and inequity problems. As a result, it moves away from the national agenda to highlight economic inequality, police misconduct, racial injustice, plus much more through online platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edtechtimes.com/2017/05/30/youth-social-media-and-smartphone-use-a-problem-or-tool-for-good/|title=Youth Social Media and Smartphone Use: A Problem or Tool for Good?|last=Murray|first=Jake|date=2017-05-30|website=EdTech Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uml.edu/news/stories/2017/prendergaststudents.aspx|title=Activist: Students Are Leaders of Social Change|website=www.uml.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Earl|first=Jennifer|last2=Maher|first2=Thomas V.|last3=Elliott|first3=Thomas|date=April 2017|title=Youth, activism, and social movements|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/soc4.12465|journal=Sociology Compass|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e12465|doi=10.1111/soc4.12465}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Tufekci, Zeynep,|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961312425|title=Twitter and tear gas : the power and fragility of networked protest|isbn=978-0-300-21512-0|location=New Haven|oclc=961312425}}</ref> Youth engagement has transformed political participation through technology and created a form of engaged citizenship.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shea|first=Daniel M.|last2=Harris|first2=Rebecca|date=April 2006|title=Why Bother?

When teachers started instructing in [[Afrikaans]], the language of their oppressors, children took the streets for a peaceful demonstration. The police reaction was brutal and on June 16, 1976, at least 25 people were killed. The violence continued and spread all across the country. By the end of the year, 575 people had died and 2,389 had been wounded.<ref name=\"Youth Activism: Volume 2\" />\n\nA contemporary challenge for [[South Africa]]n youth is the AIDS pandemic. Around 60% of adults who contract HIV become infected before they turn 25, meaning youth are particularly endangered.

The movement, led by [[All Assam Students Union]](AASU) and the 'All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad' (AAGSP), developed a program of protests and demonstration to compel the [[Indian government]] to identify and expel illegal, (mostly [[Bangladeshis]]), immigrants and protect and provide constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to the indigenous [[Assamese people]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Historical Background of Youth Activism in Assam|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/194323/8/08_chapter%203.pdf|journal=Shodhganga|pages=60}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Role of the Student of Assam Since Independence|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/67807/14/14_chapter%205.pdf|journal=Shodhganga}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Origin, Growth & Activities of AASU|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/67057/7/07_chapter%202.pdf|journal=Shodhganga}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Impact of AASU on Assam Politics|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/67057/11/11_chapter%206.pdf|journal=Shodhganga}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Youth Activism and Democratic Politics in India's Northeast-2014 Election in Perspective|url=https://www.thehinducentre.com/migration_catalog/article22982380.ece/BINARY/Policy%20Report%20No.14|journal=The Hindu Centre for Politics & Public Policy}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 January 2017 a large group of students (more than 20 lakhs) protested in [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Puducherry]] for the ban on [[Jallikattu]].

Popular motivations of youth activism in Indonesia are indigenous rights and national unity, pro-communism, anticommunism, pro-democracy and militant Islam. A common form of activism is massa, a cavalcade of motorcycles, trucks, music, and many young people on foot. These cavalcades are mostly males and end with a rally to address a certain political issue. In general, youth have been looking for political change during the last four decades.<ref name=\"Youth Activism: Encyclopedia\" />\n\n==== Malaysia ====\nVideo blogging has become increasing popular in Malaysia. Youth activists upload their videos and independent films to the popular site [[EngageMedia]]. This is used by Malaysians to encourage young people to become citizen journalists. Youth view EngageMedia as a safe space for their video blogs, but there is still fear of retribution.<ref name=\"Lim, J. 2013\" />\n\n====Nepal====\nThe 1979 student protests in Nepal were a series of protests amongst the student community in Nepal during the months of April and May 1979. The clashes that occurred had a significant historical impact, as they forced the monarchy to concede to holding a referendum on the possibility of a multiparty system in the country. Official figures stated that 11 persons were killed during the agitation, and 164 wounded.\n\nYouth and Student organisations such as Nepal Student Union, ANNFSU and Nepal Tarun Dal are key forces behind protests and demonstration against authoritarian governments. Youths have been standing in the forefront in 1951, 1980, 1990 and 2005 democratic movements.\n\n====The Philippines====\nYouth activism has had a long history in the Philippines. The original founding members of the [[Katipunan]] as well as the [[Propaganda Movement]] consisted of youths. The country's national hero, [[Jose Rizal]] was martyred at the ripe age of 35. In 1964, aiming to continue the revolutionary tradition of the Katipunan, the [[Kabataang Makabayan]] was formed against the Marcos regime. It became an underground organization in 1972 after the declaration of Martial Law but continues to organize in this manner. Other organizations campaigned against the Martial Law as well, such as LFS, NUSP and SCMP. The League of Filipino Students was formed in September 11, 1977 as an alliance against tuition fee increases. Eventually it became a mass organization of students campaigning against the fascist dictatorship. Around the 60s, the NUSP dominated the scene of student activism and aided in the various student council mobilizations across the country. In 1960, the Student Christian Movement of the Philippines was formed, rallying thousands of church youth against the Marcos regime. In 1997, leaders from these organizations would eventually form ANAKBAYAN, a comprehensive mass organization of the Filipino youth, turning to combine both organizing students and community youth.\n\n==== Singapore ====\nSingapore is one of the most developed information and communication technology (ICT) countries in the world. In 2010 the computer ownership rate was 84 percent, with internet access at 78 percent. In 2009, mobile phone penetration reached 137 percent, meaning many people of Singapore have access to more than one phone.<ref name=\"Zhang, W. 2013\">Zhang, W. (2013).

In the 2011 general election, people between the ages of 21 and 34 were more active in online politics. Youth who wrote about elections on blogs, Facebook or Twitter were at 28 percent, while the general public were only 10 percent.<ref name=\"Zhang, W. 2013\"/>\n\n===Middle East===\n\n==== Egypt ====\nYouth proved to be central to the Egyptian Revolution and the [[April 6 Movement]].\n\n==== Iran ====\nYoung adults in Iran defy the official regime's cultural and political policies through engaging in prohibited activities in places like taxi rides, coffee shops, and basements. Such actions re-imagine Iranian reality in ways that contest regime policies.<ref>Khosravi, S.  2008. Young and Defiant in Tehran.  University of Pennsylvania Press, pp. 169-170, 174</ref>\n\n==== Saudi Arabia ====\nYouth citizens of [[Saudi Arabia]] seek quiet forms of resistance because outright activism is prohibited. Students blog to share viewpoints and feelings despite potential personal risk.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ahmari|first=Sohrab|authorlink=Sohrab Ahmari|title=Arab Spring Dreams: The Next Generation Speaks Out for Freedom and Justice from North Africa to Iran|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, 2012}}{{Page needed|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n\n==== Serbia ====\nThroughout the 1900s, youth took to the streets to protest against Serbian leader [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]. Youth activists were credited with contributing to his resignation. During the years of protests youth faced unemployment, a failing education system, and economic instability. They created the [[Exit festival|Exit]] music festival, which lasted one hundred days and led up to the September 2000 elections. The first year this festival was called [[EXIT festival#Exit 00|EXIT 00]] and has been defined as \"creative\" and \"politically savvy\" activism. The festival contained a civic education component and continues today.<ref name=\"Youth Activism: Encyclopedia\" />\n\n===North America===\n\n==== United States ====\nYouth activism as a social phenomenon in the United States truly became defined in the mid- to late-nineteenth century when young people began forming labor strikes in response to their working conditions, wages, and hours. [[Mary Harris Jones|Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones]] organized the first youth activism in the U.S., marching 100,000 child miners from the coal mines of [[Pennsylvania]] to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. in 1908. Youth newspaper carriers soon followed. These actions isolated youths' interests in the [[popular media]] of the times, and separated young people from their contemporary adult labor counterparts.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} This separation continued through the 1930s, when the [[American Youth Congress]] presented a \"Bill of Youth Rights\" to the US Congress. Their actions were indicative of a growing student movement present throughout the US from the 1920s through the early 1940s. The 1950s saw the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] bring young people into larger movements for [[civil rights]]. All the way back in 1959, Rev. Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] engaged youth activists in protesting against [[Bull Connor]]'s racist law enforcement practices in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].  The youth activism of [[Tom Hayden]], [[Keith Hefner (activist)|Keith Hefner]] and other 1960s youth laid a powerful precedent for modern youth activism. [[John Caldwell Holt|John Holt]], [[Myles Horton]] and [[Paulo Freire]] were important in this period. Youthful life and expression defined this era.\n[[File:Climate Change Activist .jpg|thumb|The image is from a climate change protest in Helsinki, Finland in 2019. The sign the young activist holds reads \"change the politics not the climate\", a powerful message to those in power.]]\n\n== Highlights of youth activism in the U.S. throughout the 21st century ==\nYouth activism continues to take place in the 21st century at local, regional, national, and international levels. Youth activists today use technology and social media such as; [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and [[TikTok|Tiktok]] to create a focal point on oppression and inequity problems. As a result, it moves away from the national agenda to highlight economic inequality, police misconduct, racial injustice, plus much more through online platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edtechtimes.com/2017/05/30/youth-social-media-and-smartphone-use-a-problem-or-tool-for-good/|title=Youth Social Media and Smartphone Use: A Problem or Tool for Good?|last=Murray|first=Jake|date=2017-05-30|website=EdTech Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uml.edu/news/stories/2017/prendergaststudents.aspx|title=Activist: Students Are Leaders of Social Change|website=www.uml.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Earl|first=Jennifer|last2=Maher|first2=Thomas V.|last3=Elliott|first3=Thomas|date=April 2017|title=Youth, activism, and social movements|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/soc4.12465|journal=Sociology Compass|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e12465|doi=10.1111/soc4.12465}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Tufekci, Zeynep,|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961312425|title=Twitter and tear gas : the power and fragility of networked protest|isbn=978-0-300-21512-0|location=New Haven|oclc=961312425}}</ref> Youth engagement has transformed political participation through technology and created a form of engaged citizenship.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shea|first=Daniel M.|last2=Harris|first2=Rebecca|date=April 2006|title=Why Bother?
