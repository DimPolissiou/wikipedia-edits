The term ''Molokan'' is an [[exonym]] used by their [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] neighbors; they tend to identify themselves as '''Spiritual Christians''' (\u0434\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0445\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0435 : ''dukhovnye khristiane'').\n\nThere are almost as many different ways among Molokans as there are Molokans. Some built chapels for worship, kept sacraments, and revered saints and icons, while others (like [[Ikonobortsy]], \"icon-wrestlers\") discarded these practices in the pursuit of [[Sola scriptura|individual approaches to scripture]]. In general, they rejected the institutionalized formalism of Orthodoxy and denominations with similar doctrines in favor of more emphasis on [[Origins of Christianity|\"Original Christianity\"]] as written and spoken by Jesus Christ in the New Testameby: \"But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.\u201d\nJohn\u202c \u202d4:23\u202c \u202dESV\u202c\u202c\nhttps://www.bible.com/59/jhn.4.23.esv They emphasized [[spirituality]] and spiritual practice; such sacramental and ritual practices have been permitted only as tangible examples and symbols of more important spiritual truths.\nSimilar to [[Presbyterian]]s among Protestants, and considered heretical by the Orthodox Church, they elect a [[Presbyterian polity|council]] of dominant [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]] who preserve a sort of [[apostolic succession]]. Molokans had some practices similar to the European [[Quakers]] and [[Mennonites]], such as [[pacifism]], communal organization, spiritual meetings, and sub-groupings. But they arose in Russia together with the [[Doukhobors]] and Sabbatarians (also known as [[Subbotniks]]) and similar Spiritual Christian movements of [[Duhovnye Kristyanye]] and Ikonobortsy. They migrated into central Russia and Ukraine around the same time.\n\n==Formation and development==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2015}}\n\n===11th to 14th centuries===\nThere are approximately 200 [[fasting]] days \u2014especially the [[Great Fast]] (Lent)\u2014 when drinking milk was prohibited by Orthodox ecclesiastical authorities.

(''Moloko'' means \"milk\" in Russian). Nonetheless, these were \"Spiritual Christians\" not directly related to the group later known as \"Molokans\". \n\nThe \"Molokans\" that are known today by that name split in 1779/80 from the [[Doukhobors]] because they thought that the Doukhobors neglected the Bible in their belief that God had placed the Word directly into their hearts. The Molokans, however, held the written Bible into the highest regard. The founder of the Molokans, [[ Simyon Matveiovich Uklein]] (1733-1809), was a son-in-law of the Doukhobor leader [[Ilarion Poberokhin]] (1720-1792) as explained by O. Beznosova (\"The Perception in the Religious Space\", 2016): \"Soon (approximately in 1779-1780) a group broke away from Pobirohin's disciples.It was led by his son in law Simeon Uklein who did not share the mystical spirit and self-deification of the former leader and defended the need for reliance on the Gospel texts in the organization of church life (Margaritov, 1914). This group (called \"Molokans\") became a \"rational\" direction of. Spiritual Christianity, as opposed to the \"mystics\" - \"christoverchestvo\" adherents, \"Doukhobors\" and \"[[skoptsy]]\".\" (p. 322) \n\nUklein's Molokans from Tambov energetically proselytized in settlements along the [[Volga River]] and Russia's south-eastern frontier, spreading the Molokan faith in [[Orenburg]], [[Saratov]] and [[Astrakhan]] provinces and organizing congregations until his death in 1809.\n\n===19th to 20th centuries===\nFrom the intervention of Count [[Nikolay Alexandrovich Zubov|Nikolay Zubov]] in 1795, Molokans (\u0431\u0435\u0441\u0448\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438) were tolerated under Tsarina Catherine but constrained by strict rules imposed upon them intended to curb community growth.<ref>[http://lvov.judaica.spb.ru/gersub.shtml]</ref> Those who ignored the restrictions were punished in [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]] as [[Christian heresy|heretics]].<ref>[http://lvov.judaica.spb.ru/herm.shtml]</ref> Molokan evangelists and missionaries suffered imprisonment, banishment and other forms of punishment. Prohibited from winning converts,<ref>[http://lvov.judaica.spb.ru/problems.shtml]</ref> the Molokans were forced into [[endogamy]]. The government's policy was to send the Molokans away from the center of Russia into the Caucasus (1833), and other outlying areas to prevent their having influence on other peasants; they were sent to [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] (1834), [[Ukraine]] (1830s), central [[Asia]], and [[Siberia]], where many communities have survived into the present.\nIt is said that, in 1900, despite the persecution there could have been about a half-million Spiritual Christians in the Russia empire. These figures appear, however, to be vastly exaggerated. In 1912, there were only 133,935 ''Molokane'' and 4,844 ''Pryguny'' counted in Russia (census of the Department of Spiritual Affairs; see [[Glenn Dynner]]: \"Holy Dissent: Jewish and Christian Mystics in Eastern Europe\", 2011).\nFewer than one thousand ''Molokane'' fled Russia in the early 1900s (mostly 1905-1912), many of whom settled near other non-Orthodox immigrants from Russia in an ethnic [[enclave]] on and near [[Potrero Hill]], [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], where they built a prayer hall in 1929. A second prayer hall was established near [[Sheridan, Placer County, California|Sheridan, California]] to serve those scattered in Northern California. There was never a \"Molokan Church\" in Southern California.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Conovaloff|first1=Andrei|url=http://www.molokane.org/taxonomy/|title=Taxonomy of 3 Spiritual Christian groups: Molokane, Pryguny and Dukh-i-zhizniki \u2014 books, fellowship, holidays, prophets and songs.|publisher=Molokane.org}}</ref> Though some Spiritual Christian faith groups fled Russia in the early 1900s to avoid the military draft, all eligible ''Molokan'' boys registered for the [[Selective Service Act of 1917]], but were disqualified as aliens who did not speak English.

By original ''Molokans'' who either refused to be evangelized by Protestant denominations or insisted that they will retain their faith unchanged by the \"Spiritual Molokan Jumper & Skipper\" revivalist movement in the 1830s.

Eugene|title=The Woman Clothed in the Sun: Pacifism and Apocalyptic Discourse among Russian Spiritual Christian Molokan Jumpers & Skippers}}</ref> The old Molokans were termed ''Constants'' (Postoyaniye), and the newly evolved \"Spiritual\" Molokans \"Jumpers\" (''Pryguny'') also called ''Skakuny'' (Skppers). The Molokan ''Jumpers'' believed they were visited by a manifestation of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:7), and this new smaller Molokan sect began a revival with intense zeal, reporting miracles that purportedly rivaled those of Christ's apostles. \n\n=== Seeds of exodus ===\nThe \"Constant\" Molokan sect condemned the new sect to authorities, resulting in betrayals and imprisonment for many of the \"Spiritual\" Molokan Jumpers & Skippers. Some of these \"Spiritual\" Molokans called themselves \"New Israelites\", when their leader [[Maxim Rudometkin]] in Nikitino, Erivan Guberniya  was announced to be the \"King of the Spirits\" in 1853. The group, also known as Maximists\", considered [[Efim Gerasimovic  Klubnikin]] (1842-1915) also in Nikitino, a divinely inspired 12-year-old boy prophet. He prophesied a \"coming time that would be unbearable and that the time to leave Russia was now.\" During the early 20th century under his leadership, about 2,000 ''Pryguny'' emigrated to the [[United States]], first settling on the east side of [[Los Angeles]]. Most seeking rural isolation moved to Baja Mexico, then Arizona, Central California, and some other parts of the West Coast and Canada. Other Jumpers received a land grant from the [[Mexican government]] and settled in the [[Guadalupe, Baja California|Guadalupe Valley]] in [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]].\n\nIn Los Angeles, a small number of the Molokan Jumpers joined the development of the American Revival called \"the [[Pentecostal]] [[Azusa Street Revival]].\" The founder of [[The Full Gospel Business Men's Association]] associates this [[Pentecostal]] [[Christian revival|Revival]] to a child prophet of the Molokan Jumpers, E.G. Klubnikin.\n\n=== Diaspora ===\n[[File: Glendale-The_first_Russian_Molokans_Church-1950.JPG|250px|thumb|The first''' Russian Molokans Church''' (Spiritual Christians) in Glendale, Arizona was built in 1950 and is located at 7402 Griffin Ave. It is listed as historical by the Glendale Arizona Historical Society.]]\nAbout 20,000 people identify as Molokans, at least ethnically, in the former Soviet Union. There are approximately 200 Molokan churches, 150 of them in Russia and [[Azerbaijan]]. They also lived in the [[North Caucasus]], [[Southern Ukraine]], [[Armenia]], and [[Central Asia]], where ancestors had been exiled long ago.\n\nApproximately 25,000 Molokans reside in the United States, of whom about 5,000 \"ethnically\" identify as Molokans. The majority live in or near [[Los Angeles]], particularly in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]], [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles|Boyle Heights]], and [[Commerce, California|Commerce]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/14/local/me-22608 | title=Laid to Rest Among Their Ancestors| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=1998-09-14| last1=Martin| first1=Hugo}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s other Molokans settled in southern [[Alaska]] and [[Australia]]. Molokans are said to be numerous in [[Australia]]. The majority are in [[South Australia]], with a number of families in [[Western Australia]] and a small group residing in [[Queensland]]. Over 1,000 reside in Canada in the province of [[British Columbia]] and hundreds more in [[Alberta]], keeping their traditional communal lifestyle. A group of Molokan families are also living in [[South America]] in the country of [[Uruguay]].\n\nA small Molokan community was located in the eastern province of [[Kars]], [[Turkey]]. Most of the community returned to Russia years ago; in the 21st century only one family of Molokans is left in Kars.<ref>[http://www.todayszaman.com/national_molokan-community-still-exists-in-kars-despite-decreasing-number_285869.html], ''Today's Zaman''</ref>\n\n==Spiritual practices==\nMolokans adhere to Old Testament laws in the spirit of the Christian [[New Covenant]]. All sects refrain from eating pork, shellfish, or other \"unclean\" foods, as defined in the Bible. Molokans refer to the sabbath on Sunday. Some refuse to serve on juries or file lawsuits against fellow church members. Church services, led by a [[Lector]], are conducted predominantly in the Russian language, but also in [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Slavonic]], which was common to the Orthodox Church. Men and women sit apart, and services are usually quite active. They do not worship saints, and do not worship symbols or images, such as  icons or crosses. as the Molokans traditionally practice [[endogamy]] and marry within the faith.\n\n== Molokans in the United States ==\n\n=== Naming ===\nMolokans are known for having different spellings of last names within the same immediate family for a few reasons. 1. The names were horribly misspelled when they arrived in the United States, two they were terribly translated and others changed the spelling because they were afraid to be taken back. They also in several cases chose to go with American versions of their names. So \"Vasilli Bukroff\" becomes \"Bill\" or \"William Bukroff\" or \"Ivan Metchikoff\" will become \"John Mitchell\" and \"Dunya Tikunov\" will be \"Julie Tyler\".  They also sometimes use \"first names\" that are not their legal names and are based on nicknames from childhood within the church that stuck with people as adults. For example, \"Hazel Valov\" became known as \"Percy Valov\", for being very \"persistent\".  Another naming practice that can become confusing for those who are unfamiliar is those who settled in the Guadalupe Valley, Mexico.  Many settlers took on the Mexican versions of their names so Rodion Pavlov became \"Rodolfo Pabloff\" and when they had children they also adopted the Mexican format so you will see what would have been a Russian name like \"Ivan Pavilovich Pabloff\" (Ivan son of Pavil (Paul) (Pavlov), whose mother's maiden name is \"Samarin\" become \"Juan Pablo Pabloff de Samarin\" or \"Juan Samarin Pabloff\".  In all these instances, tracing family history can become very difficult \nOtherwise they adhere to the common naming practices. A lot can be learned from a Russian head stone which will commonly go back to use of the Russian naming practices regardless of what they used while alive. If translated correctly you should learn the names of the father and grandfather from a male's headstone. If it is displayed in English at the bottom it most likely will not contain the information.\n\n=== Legal issues ===\nOn June 8, 1917, the ''[[The Arizona Republic|Arizona Republican]]'' reported that the Molokan community in Glendale, Arizona, refused to register under the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|selective service act of 1917]]. The likely result would be the arrest of Molokan persons who refused to sign the order. Molokans claimed that their religious precepts forbade them from signing into such an agreement. The Russians had forced them into the military and that is why they fled Russia for the United States. The Molokans feared that history would repeat itself in America as it had in Russia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84020558/1917-06-08/ed-1/seq-8/|title=Arizona republican.

Thirty-three other Molokans were arrested for creating a disturbance outside of the jail house wherein women were hitting police with their umbrellas and one knife wielding man had to be overpowered. At the sentencing of the 35 young men, the courtroom was a wild scene and some attendants were slightly injured while being subdued.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025316/1917-08-09/ed-1/seq-5/|title=The Daily Missoulian.

The Molokan colonies and communities were called cults and Molokans were harassed by Americans with the creation of the derogatory term Molokan Slackers. The Molokans were given this moniker due to their history of averting state marriage laws and pacifist belief system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1920-01-21/ed-1/seq-10/|title=The sun.

Their leader [[Matvei Dalmatov|Matvei Simyonich Dalmatov (\u041c\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0414\u0430\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432)]] became a martyr in a monastery prison by [[breaking wheel|wheeling]].\n\n===17th to 18th centuries===\nThe first recorded use of the term \"Molokan\" appears in the 1670s, in reference to the people who had the practice of drinking milk on the 200 fasting days stipulated by the Orthodox Church. (''Moloko'' means \"milk\" in Russian). Nonetheless, these were \"Spiritual Christians\" not directly related to the group later known as \"Molokans\". \n\nThe \"Molokans\" that are known today by that name split in 1779/80 from the [[Doukhobors]] because they thought that the Doukhobors neglected the Bible in their belief that God had placed the Word directly into their hearts. The Molokans, however, held the written Bible into the highest regard. The founder of the Molokans, [[Semen Matveev Uklein]] (1733-1809), was a son-in-law of the Doukhobor leader [[Ilarion Poberokhin]] (1720-1792) as explained by O. Beznosova (\"The Perception in the Religious Space\", 2016): \"Soon (approximately in 1779-1780) a group broke away from Pobirohin's disciples.It was led by his son in law Simeon Uklein who did not share the mystical spirit and self-deification of the former leader and defended the need for reliance on the Gospel texts in the organization of church life (Margaritov, 1914). This group (called \"Molokans\") became a \"rational\" direction of. Spiritual Christianity, as opposed to the \"mystics\" - \"christoverchestvo\" adherents, \"Doukhobors\" and \"[[skoptsy]]\".\" (p. 322) \n\nUklein's Molokans from Tambov energetically proselytized in settlements along the [[Volga River]] and Russia's south-eastern frontier, spreading the Molokan faith in [[Orenburg]], [[Saratov]] and [[Astrakhan]] provinces and organizing congregations until his death in 1809.\n\n===19th to 20th centuries===\nFrom the intervention of Count [[Nikolay Alexandrovich Zubov|Nikolay Zubov]] in 1795, Molokans (\u0431\u0435\u0441\u0448\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438) were tolerated under Tsarina Catherine but constrained by strict rules imposed upon them intended to curb community growth.<ref>[http://lvov.judaica.spb.ru/gersub.shtml]</ref> Those who ignored the restrictions were punished in [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]] as [[Christian heresy|heretics]].<ref>[http://lvov.judaica.spb.ru/herm.shtml]</ref> Molokan evangelists and missionaries suffered imprisonment, banishment and other forms of punishment. Prohibited from winning converts,<ref>[http://lvov.judaica.spb.ru/problems.shtml]</ref> the Molokans were forced into [[endogamy]]. The government's policy was to send the Molokans away from the center of Russia into the Caucasus (1833), and other outlying areas to prevent their having influence on other peasants; they were sent to [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] (1834), [[Ukraine]] (1830s), central [[Asia]], and [[Siberia]], where many communities have survived into the present.\n\nIt is said that, in 1900, despite the persecution there could have been about a half-million Spiritual Christians in the Russia empire. These figures appear, however, to be vastly exaggerated. In 1912, there were only 133,935 ''Molokane'' and 4,844 ''Pryguny'' counted in Russia (census of the Department of Spiritual Affairs; see [[Glenn Dynner]]: \"Holy Dissent: Jewish and Christian Mystics in Eastern Europe\", 2011).\n\nFewer than one thousand ''Molokane'' fled Russia in the early 1900s (mostly 1905-1912), many of whom settled near other non-Orthodox immigrants from Russia in an ethnic [[enclave]] on and near [[Potrero Hill]], [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], where they built a prayer hall in 1929. A second prayer hall was established near [[Sheridan, Placer County, California|Sheridan, California]] to serve those scattered in Northern California. There was never a \"Molokan Church\" in Southern California.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Conovaloff|first1=Andrei|url=http://www.molokane.org/taxonomy/|title=Taxonomy of 3 Spiritual Christian groups: Molokane, Pryguny and Dukh-i-zhizniki \u2014 books, fellowship, holidays, prophets and songs.|publisher=Molokane.org}}</ref> Though some Spiritual Christian faith groups fled Russia in the early 1900s to avoid the military draft, all eligible ''Molokan'' boys registered for the [[Selective Service Act of 1917]], but were disqualified as aliens who did not speak English.

Eugene|title=The Woman Clothed in the Sun: Pacifism and Apocalyptic Discourse among Russian Spiritual Christian Molokan Jumpers & Skippers}}</ref> The old Molokans were termed ''Constants'' (Postoyaniye), and the newly evolved \"Spiritual\" Molokans \"Jumpers\" (''Pryguny'') also called ''Skakuny'' (Skppers). The Molokan ''Jumpers'' believed they were visited by a manifestation of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:7), and this new smaller Molokan sect began a revival with intense zeal, reporting miracles that purportedly rivaled those of Christ's apostles. \n\n=== Seeds of exodus ===\nThe \"Constant\" Molokan sect condemned the new sect to authorities, resulting in betrayals and imprisonment for many of the \"Spiritual\" Molokan Jumpers & Skippers. Some of these \"Spiritual\" Molokans called themselves \"New Israelites\", when their leader [[Maxim Rudometkin]] in Nikitino, Erivan Guberniya  was announced to be the \"King of the Spirits\" in 1853. The group, also known as Maximists\", considered [[Efim Gerasimovic  Klubnikin]] (1842-1915) also in Nikitino, a divinely inspired 12-year-old boy prophet. He prophesied a \"coming time that would be unbearable and that the time to leave Russia was now.\" During the early 20th century under his leadership, about 2,000 ''Pryguny'' emigrated to the [[United States]], first settling on the east side of [[Los Angeles]]. Most seeking rural isolation moved to Baja Mexico, then Arizona, Central California, and some other parts of the West Coast and Canada. Other Jumpers received a land grant from the [[Mexican government]] and settled in the [[Guadalupe, Baja California|Guadalupe Valley]] in [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]].\n\nIn Los Angeles, a small number of the Molokan Jumpers joined the development of the American Revival called \"the [[Pentecostal]] [[Azusa Street Revival]].\" The founder of [[The Full Gospel Business Men's Association]] associates this [[Pentecostal]] [[Christian revival|Revival]] to a child prophet of the Molokan Jumpers, E.G. Klubnikin.\n\n=== Diaspora ===\n[[File: Glendale-The_first_Russian_Molokans_Church-1950.JPG|250px|thumb|The first''' Russian Molokans Church''' (Spiritual Christians) in Glendale, Arizona was built in 1950 and is located at 7402 Griffin Ave. It is listed as historical by the Glendale Arizona Historical Society.]]\nAbout 20,000 people identify as Molokans, at least ethnically, in the former Soviet Union. There are approximately 200 Molokan churches, 150 of them in Russia and [[Azerbaijan]]. They also lived in the [[North Caucasus]], [[Southern Ukraine]], [[Armenia]], and [[Central Asia]], where ancestors had been exiled long ago.\n\nApproximately 25,000 Molokans reside in the United States, of whom about 5,000 \"ethnically\" identify as Molokans. The majority live in or near [[Los Angeles]], particularly in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]], [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles|Boyle Heights]], and [[Commerce, California|Commerce]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/14/local/me-22608 | title=Laid to Rest Among Their Ancestors| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=1998-09-14| last1=Martin| first1=Hugo}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s other Molokans settled in southern [[Alaska]] and [[Australia]]. Molokans are said to be numerous in [[Australia]]. The majority are in [[South Australia]], with a number of families in [[Western Australia]] and a small group residing in [[Queensland]]. Over 1,000 reside in Canada in the province of [[British Columbia]] and hundreds more in [[Alberta]], keeping their traditional communal lifestyle. A group of Molokan families are also living in [[South America]] in the country of [[Uruguay]].\n\nA small Molokan community was located in the eastern province of [[Kars]], [[Turkey]]. Most of the community returned to Russia years ago; in the 21st century only one family of Molokans is left in Kars.<ref>[http://www.todayszaman.com/national_molokan-community-still-exists-in-kars-despite-decreasing-number_285869.html], ''Today's Zaman''</ref>\n\n==Spiritual practices==\nMolokans adhere to Old Testament laws in the spirit of the Christian [[New Covenant]]. All sects refrain from eating pork, shellfish, or other \"unclean\" foods, as defined in the Bible. Molokans refer to the sabbath on Sunday. Some refuse to serve on juries or file lawsuits against fellow church members. Church services, led by a [[Lector]], are conducted predominantly in the Russian language, but also in [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Slavonic]], which was common to the Orthodox Church. Men and women sit apart, and services are usually quite active. They do not worship saints, and do not worship symbols or images, such as  icons or crosses. as the Molokans traditionally practice [[endogamy]] and marry within the faith.\n\n== Molokans in the United States ==\n\n=== Naming ===\nMolokans are known for having different spellings of last names within the same immediate family for a few reasons. 1. The names were horribly misspelled when they arrived in the United States, two they were terribly translated and others changed the spelling because they were afraid to be taken back. They also in several cases chose to go with American versions of their names. So \"Vasilli Bukroff\" becomes \"Bill\" or \"William Bukroff\" or \"Ivan Metchikoff\" will become \"John Mitchell\" and \"Dunya Tikunov\" will be \"Julie Tyler\".  They also sometimes use \"first names\" that are not their legal names and are based on nicknames from childhood within the church that stuck with people as adults. For example, \"Hazel Valov\" became known as \"Percy Valov\", for being very \"persistent\".  Another naming practice that can become confusing for those who are unfamiliar is those who settled in the Guadalupe Valley, Mexico.  Many settlers took on the Mexican versions of their names so Rodion Pavlov became \"Rodolfo Pabloff\" and when they had children they also adopted the Mexican format so you will see what would have been a Russian name like \"Ivan Pavilovich Pabloff\" (Ivan son of Pavil (Paul) (Pavlov), whose mother's maiden name is \"Samarin\" become \"Juan Pablo Pabloff de Samarin\" or \"Juan Samarin Pabloff\".  In all these instances, tracing family history can become very difficult \nOtherwise they adhere to the common naming practices. A lot can be learned from a Russian head stone which will commonly go back to use of the Russian naming practices regardless of what they used while alive. If translated correctly you should learn the names of the father and grandfather from a male's headstone. If it is displayed in English at the bottom it most likely will not contain the information.\n\n=== Legal issues ===\nOn June 8, 1917, the ''[[The Arizona Republic|Arizona Republican]]'' reported that the Molokan community in Glendale, Arizona, refused to register under the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|selective service act of 1917]]. The likely result would be the arrest of Molokan persons who refused to sign the order. Molokans claimed that their religious precepts forbade them from signing into such an agreement. The Russians had forced them into the military and that is why they fled Russia for the United States. The Molokans feared that history would repeat itself in America as it had in Russia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84020558/1917-06-08/ed-1/seq-8/|title=Arizona republican.

Thirty-three other Molokans were arrested for creating a disturbance outside of the jail house wherein women were hitting police with their umbrellas and one knife wielding man had to be overpowered. At the sentencing of the 35 young men, the courtroom was a wild scene and some attendants were slightly injured while being subdued.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025316/1917-08-09/ed-1/seq-5/|title=The Daily Missoulian.

The Molokans were given this moniker due to their history of averting state marriage laws and pacifist belief system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030431/1920-01-21/ed-1/seq-10/|title=The sun.

The following year, the school's athletics council officially recognized basketball as a sport.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/>\n\nBefore the 1920\u201321 season the university changed its name from North Carolina A&M to North Carolina State College. At that time the school's nickname was the \"Tech.\"<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/> That season the program joined the fledgling [[Southern Conference]] as a charter member.<ref name=\"packpride\">{{cite web|last=Crawford|first=Jacob|title=Complete History of NC State Basketball|url=http://northcarolinastate.scout.com/2/209048.html|publisher=Pack Pride|date=2003-12-26|accessdate=2008-06-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517115139/http://northcarolinastate.scout.com/2/209048.html|archivedate=2009-05-17}}</ref> State College changed its nickname yet again in 1923, this time to the \"Red Terrors.\" The name was drawn from a combination of the play of Rochelle \"Red\" Johnson and the team's new bright red road uniforms. Also in 1923, State opened its first basketball facility, Frank Thompson Gym. The gym, named in honor of a former athlete from the school who died in action during [[World War I]], served as the team's home until 1948.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/> During the first years of the program, the team had no practice facility and was forced to practice on an outdoor field in nearby [[Pullen Park]].<ref>Chapelow ''Raleigh's Reynolds Coliseum'', p.34</ref>\n\nGus Tebell took over the basketball team as head coach in 1924. During his tenure he led the program to a number of school firsts, including the first conference championship in 1929 and the first 20-win season. He compiled a then all-time program best career coaching record at 79\u201336. The Wolfpack's first player to garner significant national recognition was Bud Rose, who, after the 1931\u201332 season, was named as an honorable mention All-American.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/>\n\nIn 1941 the university began construction on [[Reynolds Coliseum|William Neal Reynolds Coliseum]], a multi-purpose arena that would serve as the new home of Wolfpack basketball. Construction was stalled due to the involvement of the United States in [[World War II]], and the skeleton structure of the arena was left unfinished for nearly six years until its completion in 1949. The Wolfpack would play its home games at Reynolds for the next 50 years, until the men's team moved to [[PNC Arena]] in 1999.\n\n===Everett Case era (1946\u20131965)===\nFollowing the end of World War II, chancellor [[John W. Harrelson]] and athletic director H.A. Fisher set upon rebuilding the university's athletic teams. In 1946 David Clark, a former president of the NC State Alumni Association, suggested to the Athletics Council that the best place to search for a new head basketball coach would be in Indiana, which was a basketball hotbed at the time. Per Clark's suggestion, Harrelson and his father Stejem Mark met with Indiana native [[Chuck Taylor (salesman)|Chuck Taylor]] who was in Raleigh to coach his army team in an exhibition game against NC State. Taylor's recommendation for the job was his former high school coach [[Everett Case]].<ref name=\"Chapelow-34\">Chappelow ''Raleigh's Reynolds Coliseum, p.34</ref> When approached by Harrelson about the job, Case was at first hesitant because of the tight restrictions under which the program had been operating. Harrelson assured Case that he would be given an expanded budget and more than enough scholarships to field a competitive team. Additionally, Case was lured by the still unfinished Reynolds Coliseum. He accepted the job almost immediately without ever visiting the campus.<ref name=\"Menzer-30\">Menzer ''Four Corners'', p.30</ref>\n\n====Six consecutive Southern Conference titles====\n\nEverett Case was named head coach on July 1, 1946. Case had previously coached high school basketball in Indiana, where in 23 seasons he compiled a 726\u201375 record and won four state championships at Frankfort, High School.<ref name=\"ID-HOF\">{{cite web|title=Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame: Everett Case|url=http://www.hoopshall.com/inductees/1968/case.html|accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref> Before arriving at NC State, he spent two years as an assistant coach at the [[University of Southern California]] and spent several years coaching teams at various Naval bases during the war.<ref name=\"Menzer-29\">Menzer ''Four Corners'', p.29</ref> In February 1947, his first season at NC State, Case defeated [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] in Chapel Hill, 48\u201346 in overtime, beginning a streak of 15 consecutive victories over the Tar Heels. Later that month, an afternoon game in Thompson Gym against [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] was postponed by city fire officials because of overcrowding. That evening the game was officially canceled after fans were found sneaking through bathroom windows, breaking down doors, and hiding in the basement.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\">Media Guide, p. 102</ref> Less than three weeks later, Case guided the Red Terrors to their first Southern Conference championship in 18 years. Case and his team celebrated by performing an Indiana high school tradition of cutting down the nets. The tradition soon spread to college teams across the nation and survives amongst championship teams to this day.<ref name=\"nets\">{{cite web|title=Cutting down the nets part of winning fabric|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/tourney05/2005-03-23-trimming-nets_x.htm|last=Gluskin|first=Michael|publisher=USA Today|date=2005-03-23|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> Soon after his arrival, Case was named \"Tar Heel of the Week\" by the Raleigh ''[[News and Observer]]'', citing that \"since the little man came here from Indiana...basketball has almost supplanted politics as the favorite topic of discussion in the North Carolina capital.\"<ref name=\"Grundy-196\">Grundy ''Learning to Win'', p.196</ref> In Case's second season as head coach the team changed its nickname from the Red Terrors to the Wolfpack.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/>\n\nIn February 1948, Case made alterations to the design of the still incomplete Reynolds Coliseum. Attempting to usurp [[Duke University|Duke]]'s [[Cameron Indoor Stadium]] as the largest basketball arena in the area,<ref name=\"packpride\"/> Case insisted that the blueprints be changed to increase the maximum capacity from 9,000 seats to 12,400.

Both seasons ended in early exits from the NCAA Tournament, though. In 1951 State defeated [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]] in the first round before losing to [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]]. In 1952 the team lost in the first round to [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] and future North Carolina head coach [[Frank McGuire]].\n\nThe Wolfpack's six-year winning streak against North Carolina came to an end in January 1953, as the Wolfpack, ranked #17 in the country, lost to the unranked Tar Heels in Raleigh, 70\u201369.<ref>{{cite web|title=AP Ranking for Wednesday, January 2, 1952|url=http://www.sportsstats.com/AP/Ranking/19520102.html|publisher=SportStats.com|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref> It was the first match between the two schools since the hiring of Frank \"the man\" McGuire the previous summer. McGuire inflamed NC State players and fans by having his players cut down the nets in Reynolds Coliseum following the victory.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> Despite the loss, the Pack finished first in the conference at 13\u20133 but lost in the conference tournament championship game. The team was ranked 18th in the final AP poll of 1953 but was left out of the NCAA Tournament for the first time in four years.\n\n====The move to the ACC====\n\nBy the end of the 1952\u201353 season the Southern Conference had bloated to 17 members and was still seen as a football-centric conference. Maryland and Duke had become national football powers and there weren't many schools in the conference that could regularly compete against them. In an effort to create a more balanced round-robin schedule and thus secure an automatic bid to the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], the top eight football schools from the conference\u2014Maryland, Duke, UNC, Virginia, South Carolina, Clemson, Wake Forest, and NC State\u2014left to form the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].<ref name=\"Menzer-43-44\">Menzer ''Four Corners'', p.43\u201344</ref>\n\nNC State's first ACC contest was on the road against Wake Forest in December 1953. The Wolfpack was ranked #8 in the nation at the time, but just as in the first ever meeting between the two schools, Wake Forest prevailed. Case and his squad defeated the Demon Deacons later that season in the first-ever ACC Tournament championship game, 82\u201380 in overtime. The victory meant a return trip to the [[1954 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], where NC State defeated George Washington in the first round before losing to eventual champion La Salle in the second round. Case's squad won a second ACC title the following year, defeating Duke in 87\u201377 in the championship game. The team finished with a 28\u20134 record but was ineligible for postseason play; earlier in the season the NCAA imposed four years' probation and banned them from postseason play during that time for numerous recruiting violations.<ref>[https://web1.ncaa.org/LSDBi/exec/miSearch?miSearchSubmit=publicReport&key=29&publicTerms=THIS%20PHRASE%20WILL%20NOT%20BE%20REPEATED 1956 infraction report]</ref> The Wolfpack brought home a third consecutive ACC title in the 1955\u201356 season, setting a record for consecutive ACC championships that stood until 2002. The team also played in its first televised game earlier that season, losing to North Carolina in Chapel Hill, 73\u201369.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> State struggled in the 1956\u201357 season, finishing fifth in the conference for the first time under Case.  State's loss in the first round of that year's [[1957 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]] also marked the first time that Case did not lead his team to the conference championship game. To add insult to injury, bitter rival North Carolina brought the ACC its first national championship.  The team finished third in 1958 and was ranked 20th in the nation at the season's end but again lost early in the [[1958 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]], this time to North Carolina in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe 1958 Dixie Classic brought to Reynolds Coliseum some of the most talented teams ever assembled for the tournament. Included in the field were eight players who eventually earned All-American honors, including NC State's [[Lou Pucillo]] and [[John Richter]], North Carolina's Lee Shaffer, York Larese, and Doug Moe, [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]]'s [[Oscar Robertson]], [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]]'s [[Johnny Green (basketball)|Johnny Green]], and [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]]'s [[Don Goldstein]]. Later that season, NC State, ranked #10 in the nation, defeated North Carolina, ranked #5, 80\u201356 to win their fourth ACC championship in six seasons.  However, due to the 1956 sanctions, they were ineligible for the NCAA Tournament. The Pack finished the season ranked #6 with a 22\u20134 record.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/>\n\n====Case's final years====\nThe 1959\u201360 Wolfpack team finished with an 11\u201315 record, marking Case's first losing season in Raleigh. The team finished fourth in the ACC in 1961 and third in 1962 but lost in the first round of the conference tournament both seasons. In the summer of 1962, Case, then 62 years old, hired his former player and then Clemson head coach [[Press Maravich]] to be his top assistant. Case's health began to deteriorate rapidly over the following two seasons as the Wolfpack finished fifth in the ACC in 1963 and seventh in 1964. The seventh-place finish was the lowest of Case's tenure and would prove to be his last. On December 7, 1964, just two games into the season, Everett Case retired and named Maravich as his successor.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> During his tenure, Case won six Southern Conference titles, four ACC titles, and qualified for the NCAA Tournament twice. His overall record of 377\u2013134 remains the best in NC State history.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nMaravich led the Pack to second-place finish in the conference and an ACC championship, its first in six years.

On April 30, 1966, the day after Maravich announced that he was leaving, Everett Case died while in a Raleigh hospital.\n\n===Norm Sloan era (1967\u20131980)===\nJust a week after Maravich's exit, former Wolfpack basketball and football player [[Norm Sloan]] was hired as the new head coach. In 1967\u201368, his first season, Sloan's team finished the regular season third in the ACC with a 9\u20135 conference record.<ref name=\"media-guide-103\">Media Guide, p. 103</ref> State made it as far as the ACC championship game before losing to North Carolina 87\u201350, but it was the Pack's semifinal game against tenth-ranked Duke that is most remembered. Sloan realized that his team was vastly undersized against the Blue Devils. He decided, however, to use the Wolfpack's quickness to its advantage and keep the ball away from the Duke players for as much of the game as possible. Using a tactic he coined \"stall-ball,\" Sloan instructed his players to hold the ball at halfcourt and slow the game down as much as possible. The final result was the lowest scoring game in ACC Tournament history. Duke led 4\u20132 at halftime and the Wolfpack held the ball for more than 13 straight minutes in the second half.

The team finished the regular season at 23\u20137 overall and third in the conference. In the conference championship game, the Pack defeated third-ranked [[South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball|South Carolina]] 42\u201339 in double overtime.<ref name=\"media-guide-103\"/> With the victory, the Wolfpack was invited to its first NCAA Tournament in five years. State received a bye in the first round of the tournament and lost its first game to St. Bonaventure in the semifinals, 80\u201368. In the Eastern Regional third-place game, the Pack defeated Niagara, 108\u201388. Despite State's quick exit from the tournament, Sloan's squad finished the season ranked tenth in the AP poll, its first end-of-the-season ranking since being ranked sixth following the 1958\u201359 season.\n\nDuring the spring of 1970, just after the season's end, Sloan signed [[Tom Burleson]]. Burleson, a 7'4\" native of [[Newland, NC]], was the first major player of the Wolfpack squad that would have a combined record of 57\u20131 during the 1972\u201373 and 1973\u201374 seasons to be signed. The following spring, Sloan signed the remaining pieces of the 1974 championship nucleus, 6'4\" [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]], 5'7\" point guard [[Monte Towe]], and 6'7\" power forward [[Tim Stoddard]].<ref name=\"media-guide-103\"/> At the time, the NCAA prohibited freshmen from competing on varsity squads and the team struggled in the following two seasons, finishing seventh in the ACC in 1970\u201371 and fifth in 1971\u201372. At 13\u201314 overall, the 1970\u201371 season was Sloan's worst and his only losing season as the Wolfpack head coach.\n\nWith the addition of Thompson, Towe, and Stoddard to the starting lineup in 1972\u201373, the team rebounded quickly from its recent struggles.

His last team (1979\u201380) team reached the NCAA Tournament, losing to Iowa in the second round. Also, twice during his final six seasons in Raleigh his teams played in the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]]. In 1976, the Pack advanced to the [[1976 National Invitation Tournament|semifinals]] and in 1978, it defeated [[South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball|South Carolina]], Detroit, and [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] before falling to [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] in the [[1978 National Invitation Tournament|championship game]]. In his final season, he led the program to its 1000th victory.

Whittenburg returned to the court in time for the [[1983 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]], which most believed the Pack needed to win in order to secure a second consecutive berth in the NCAA Tournament. State did just that, defeating heavily favored North Carolina and [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia]] squads led by [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Ralph Sampson]], respectively. The Wolfpack kept winning. Their close games and exciting finishes in the ACC Tournament and early rounds of the NCAA tournament earned them the moniker The Cardiac Pack.  As a #6 seed in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], the Wolfpack won narrow victories over Pepperdine (in double overtime) and UNLV (71\u201370) before defeating [[Utah Utes men's basketball|Utah]] in the Sweet Sixteen, 75\u201356. In the regional final, NC State again defeated Virginia, 63\u201362, then defeated [[Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball|Georgia]] in the Final Four to advance to the championship game against [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|Houston]]. The Cougars, nicknamed [[Phi Slama Jama]] for their athletic, fast-paced style of play that featured [[Clyde Drexler]] and [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], were expected to win easily over the underdog Wolfpack. NC State escaped with their second national title after a last-second air ball by Dereck Whittenburg was caught and dunked by [[Lorenzo Charles]].<ref name=\"packpride\"/> The 54\u201352 final is one of the most famous in college basketball history.[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/basketball/men/02tourney/greatest-games.htm]\n\nValvano's 1984 team finished 7th in the ACC and lost in the first round of the [[1984 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] to future conference foe [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]]. The following season, with the addition of guard [[Vinny Del Negro]], the Pack began a run of five consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament. The Pack reached the Elite Eight in [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1985]] and [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1986]] and the Sweet Sixteen in [[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1989]]. In 1987, after a sixth-place finish in the regular season, NC State made another surprising run through the [[1987 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]]. In the championship game, State defeated rival North Carolina, which had gone undefeated in conference play. It was the program's last ACC championship to date. State finished second in the conference the following year and was a #3 seed in the [[1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. The team made an early exit, though, losing to #14 seed [[Murray State Racers men's basketball|Murray State]] in the first round.<ref name=\"packpride\"/>\n\nValvano's final season in Raleigh was mired in controversy after the release of the book, ''Personal Fouls'', written by Peter Golenbock. In the book, Golenbock alleged improper practices and a lack of institutional control in the NC State athletics department. The allegations included grade fixing, lowered or waived entrance requirements for athletes, the selling of tickets and sneakers by athletes, and frequent drug use by athletes.<ref name=\"personal-fouls\">{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Kent|title='Personal Fouls' Is Defended|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DF1F3DF93BA15752C0A966958260|publisher=New York Times|date=1990-01-28|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> The claims were refuted by Valvano and Chancellor [[Bruce Poulton]], claiming that some of the players might have sold some of their shoes, most notably to ACC superfan Jason Bass. The NCAA investigation, and 5 additional investigations by separate entities found only that players indeed sold shoes and their complimentary game tickets for spending money. Nonetheless, the NCAA banned NC State from postseason play for the 1989-90 season. Earlier, NC State limited itself to only 12 total scholarships for 1990-91 and 1991-92. Although Valvano was not named in the NCAA report at all, new chancellor [[Larry Monteith]] forced his resignation on April 7, 1990.<ref name=\"packpride\"/><ref>[https://web3.ncaa.org/lsdbi/search/miCaseView/report?id=101719 1989 infractions report]</ref>\n\n===Les Robinson era (1990\u20131996)===\nTo replace Valvano, NC State turned to [[East Tennessee State Buccaneers men's basketball|East Tennessee State]] coach [[Les Robinson]], who had played for Case in the 1960s. Robinson was the 1991 District Coach of the Year as selected by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) after leading NC State to a 20\u201311 record in the first season.  He was the first first-year coach in ACC history to win 20 games, post a winning regular season conference record, and win games in both the ACC and NCAA Tournaments.  The only other coach to pull off this feat is North Carolina's [[Bill Guthridge]].\n\nHowever, the lost scholarships took their full effect a year later, and the Wolfpack plummeted into the ACC's second division for the next five years. The low point of Robinson's tenure at his alma mater came during the 1992\u201393 season. Due to injuries and academic-related suspensions, Robinson was only able to dress seven players for most conference games.  They ultimately finished 8\u201319, the worst record in modern Wolfpack history.\n\nIn 1992 the ACC Tournament was expanded because of the addition of Florida State. A play-in game between the eighth and ninth place teams was created, and during his five years as the N.C. State coach after its addition, Robinson's Wolfpack played in the play-in game four out of five times (finishing seventh in 1992). Because of his team's traditional appearance in the Thursday night play-in game, the game became known as the \"Les Robinson Invitational\" by ACC fans. The play-in game was discontinued when the ACC expanded to include Miami and Virginia Tech, and required three Thursday games. With the later addition of Boston College, there are now four games on Thursday.\n\nLes Robinson would stay on as head coach through the 1995\u201396 season.  While he never tallied another winning record, his stint went a long way towards cleansing the image of the program to both insiders and outsiders.<ref name=\"packpride\"/> Robinson was appointed NC State's athletic director in 1996 and stepped down as head coach. He left to become The Citadel's athletic director in 2000.\n\n===Herb Sendek era (1996\u20132006)===\n[[File:RBC Center.jpg|right|thumb|[[PNC Arena]], which opened in 1999, is the current home of Wolfpack basketball.]]\n[[Herb Sendek|Sendek]] was hired at NC State in 1996 after three years of success at Miami (Ohio), his first head coaching experience. He immediately improved upon the Les Robinson era, winning 17 games for the program's first winning record in six years. In his first year at NC State, the Wolfpack also finished the year winning eight of 11 games, advanced to the finals of the ACC Tournament, and earned a trip to the postseason in the NIT.\n\nSendek coached NC State to the NCAA tournament five consecutive years from 2002 until 2006 (tying the school record). He had his most success during these last five years, winning his 100th game at NC State in 2002 and having a winning conference record in each year but one. In 2004, Sendek won ACC Coach of the Year and Julius Hodge, one of Sendek's most prized recruits during his NC State tenure, won the ACC Men's Basketball Player of the Year. In 2005, NC State upset defending champion Connecticut in the second round of the NCAA tournament to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, NC State's deepest run into the tournament during Sendek's years. Sendek finished his NC State coaching career with a 71\u201388 record in the ACC and a 32\u201387 record against RPI top 50 teams.  On April 3, 2006, Sendek accepted the head coaching job at Arizona State.\n\n===Sidney Lowe era (2006\u20132011)===\n[[Sidney Lowe]] was named head coach in May 2006 after a month-long search that included such targets as [[Rick Barnes]], [[John Beilein]], [[John Calipari]], and [[Steve Lavin]].<ref name=\"lowe-hire\">{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Andy|title=Sources: Pistons' Lowe agrees to coach North Carolina State|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=2433439|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2006-05-05|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> Lowe's first season got off to a good start as the Wolfpack won its first five games.

He returned to Raleigh in 2006 to replace Herb Sendek as coach, but the Wolfpack struggled to sustain any momentum in Lowe's five seasons. Although he made the NIT twice, he never made the NCAA tournament as a coach, and never finished higher than ninth place in the ACC. He went 86\u201378, including just 25\u201355 in ACC play. Lowe was 3\u201316 record against rivals Duke and North Carolina, with two of those wins coming in his first year.\n\nLowe also spent five years as an NBA head coach in Minnesota and Memphis, compiling a 79\u2013228 record.\n\n===Mark Gottfried era (2011\u20132017)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was named head coach on April 5, 2011. In his first season as head coach of NC State, [[Mark Gottfried]] recorded a 22\u201312 overall regular season record, including a 9\u20137 regular season record in the ACC, and reached the semifinals of the ACC tournament. [[Mark Gottfried]] recorded the second best season by a first-year coach at State, second only to [[Everett Case]]. Gottfried's first Wolfpack team earned a #11 seed in the 2012 NCAA Tournament. The Pack won in the tournament over sixth seeded [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball|San Diego State]] and third seeded [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, where it lost to second seeded Kansas. They finished the season ranked #20 in the AP Poll.\n\nEntering the 2012\u201313 season, expectations ran high for Gottfried's second season as head coach. The Wolfpack returned four starters from its 2012 Sweet Sixteen squad and were joined by a trio of talented freshman, each of whom were selected as [[McDonald's All-American Game|McDonald's All Americans]]. As a result, NC State started the season ranked #6 in the AP preseason poll, the Wolfpack's second-highest preseason ranking in program history. Additionally, NC State was voted as preseason favorite to win the ACC title in the conference's annual media survey and the inaugural league coaches\u2019 poll. Ultimately, [[2012\u201313 NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team|the team]] did not live up to media expectations. 24\u201311 overall, The Wolfpack finished tied for fourth in the ACC regular season standings with a 24\u201311 overall record (11\u20137 ACC) and as a #8 seed lost its first game in the second round of the 2013 NCAA tournament to [[2012-13 Temple Owls men's basketball team|Temple]].\n\nMark Gottfried began his third season as head coach of the Wolfpack having lost five of seven players who logged significant minutes (four of which were starters). They struggled for most of the season, finishing 9\u20139 in ACC play. However, the Wolfpack surprised many by making the semifinals of the ACC tournament by upsetting #11 [[2013-14 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]], who entered the tournament as a second seed. They eventually lost to a third seeded Duke team. They were selected as a #12 seed in the 2014 NCAA tournament, where they won over [[2013-14 Xavier Musketeers men's basketball team|Xavier]] in the First Four before losing in the second round to St. Louis. They finished the season 22\u201314.\n\nComing into Gottfried's fourth season, NC State had lost [[T.J. Warren]], the ACC's leading scorer the previous year, to the NBA draft. They also lost point guard Tyler Lewis, who transferred to [[Butler University|Butler]]. They finished 19\u201312 with a 10\u20138 ACC record. NC State upset [[Jahlil Okafor]] and #2 [[2014-15 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] on January 11, nearly two years after upsetting them in the same place in 2013. They also upset #15 [[2014-15 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|UNC]] in the Dean Smith Center for the first time since 2003, holding the Heels to their lowest home point total ever. These two wins, along with wins against [[2014-15 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]] and [[2014-15 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]] made Gottfried the first coach to beat all ACC Hall of Fame coaches in the same year. They made it to the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament where they lost to Duke, and were selected as an 8 seed in the NCAA tournament where they made the Sweet Sixteen, upsetting #1 [[2014-15 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]] along the way.\n\nIn Gottfried's fifth season, NC State lost half of its scoring threat with [[Trevor Lacey]] declaring for the draft and Ralston Turner and Desmond Lee graduating. Additionally, Kyle Washington transferred to the [[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]]. NC State suffered a loss in their opening game against [[2015-16 William & Mary Tribe men's basketball team|William & Mary]], and highly touted guard Terry Henderson suffered an ankle injury in the first 10 minutes, which resulted in him sitting out for the rest of the season. This was the beginning of a long and painful season for the Pack. NC State struggled to compete in the ACC after going 10\u20133 out of conference. Junior point guard, [[Anthony Barber (basketball)|Anthony \"Cat\" Barber]] finished the season as the ACC's leading scorer, averaging 23.5 points per game and making the All-ACC first team. After a tough loss to [[2015-16 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] in the second round of the ACC Tournament, NC State finished the season 16\u201317 and 5\u201313 in the ACC, making it Gottfried's worst season to date. The Wolfpack decided to not participate in any post-season tournaments.\n\nExpectations ran high for Gottfried's sixth season as head coach, with a highly touted recruiting class and several key players returning such as [[Abdul-Malik Abu]] and [[BeeJay Anya]]. It was later announced that he would be fired at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/nc-state-s-gottfried-will-not-return-next-season/16533628/ | title=NC State's

The Wolfpack also appeared in the Final Four of the 1947 [[National Invitational Tournament]], which was during the NIT's \"national championship era.\"\n\nNC State achieved its 1700th overall win against Presbyterian College, 86-68, becoming the 26th NCAA school to reach such an achievement.<ref name=\"sports-reference.com\"/>\n\n===The early years (1910\u20131945)===\nIn 1910 Guy Bryan formed a special committee that proposed to the university administration the organization of the school's first basketball team.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\">Media Guide, p. 101</ref> The program played its first official intercollegiate basketball game on February 16, 1911 against a much more experienced squad from [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Wake Forest]].

The following year, the school's athletics council officially recognized basketball as a sport.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/>\n\nBefore the 1920\u201321 season the university changed its name from North Carolina A&M to North Carolina State College. At that time the school's nickname was the \"Tech.\"<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/> That season the program joined the fledgling [[Southern Conference]] as a charter member.<ref name=\"packpride\">{{cite web|last=Crawford|first=Jacob|title=Complete History of NC State Basketball|url=http://northcarolinastate.scout.com/2/209048.html|publisher=Pack Pride|date=2003-12-26|accessdate=2008-06-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517115139/http://northcarolinastate.scout.com/2/209048.html|archivedate=2009-05-17}}</ref> State College changed its nickname yet again in 1923, this time to the \"Red Terrors.\" The name was drawn from a combination of the play of Rochelle \"Red\" Johnson and the team's new bright red road uniforms. Also in 1923, State opened its first basketball facility, Frank Thompson Gym. The gym, named in honor of a former athlete from the school who died in action during [[World War I]], served as the team's home until 1948.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/> During the first years of the program, the team had no practice facility and was forced to practice on an outdoor field in nearby [[Pullen Park]].<ref>Chapelow ''Raleigh's Reynolds Coliseum'', p.34</ref>\n\nGus Tebell took over the basketball team as head coach in 1924. During his tenure he led the program to a number of school firsts, including the first conference championship in 1929 and the first 20-win season. He compiled a then all-time program best career coaching record at 79\u201336. The Wolfpack's first player to garner significant national recognition was Bud Rose, who, after the 1931\u201332 season, was named as an honorable mention All-American.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/>\n\nIn 1941 the university began construction on [[Reynolds Coliseum|William Neal Reynolds Coliseum]], a multi-purpose arena that would serve as the new home of Wolfpack basketball. Construction was stalled due to the involvement of the United States in [[World War II]], and the skeleton structure of the arena was left unfinished for nearly six years until its completion in 1949. The Wolfpack would play its home games at Reynolds for the next 50 years, until the men's team moved to [[PNC Arena]] in 1999.\n\n===Everett Case era (1946\u20131965)===\nFollowing the end of World War II, chancellor [[John W. Harrelson]] and athletic director H.A. Fisher set upon rebuilding the university's athletic teams. In 1946 David Clark, a former president of the NC State Alumni Association, suggested to the Athletics Council that the best place to search for a new head basketball coach would be in Indiana, which was a basketball hotbed at the time. Per Clark's suggestion, Harrelson and his father Stejem Mark met with Indiana native [[Chuck Taylor (salesman)|Chuck Taylor]] who was in Raleigh to coach his army team in an exhibition game against NC State. Taylor's recommendation for the job was his former high school coach [[Everett Case]].<ref name=\"Chapelow-34\">Chappelow ''Raleigh's Reynolds Coliseum, p.34</ref> When approached by Harrelson about the job, Case was at first hesitant because of the tight restrictions under which the program had been operating. Harrelson assured Case that he would be given an expanded budget and more than enough scholarships to field a competitive team. Additionally, Case was lured by the still unfinished Reynolds Coliseum. He accepted the job almost immediately without ever visiting the campus.<ref name=\"Menzer-30\">Menzer ''Four Corners'', p.30</ref>\n\n====Six consecutive Southern Conference titles====\n\nEverett Case was named head coach on July 1, 1946. Case had previously coached high school basketball in Indiana, where in 23 seasons he compiled a 726\u201375 record and won four state championships at Frankfort, High School.<ref name=\"ID-HOF\">{{cite web|title=Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame: Everett Case|url=http://www.hoopshall.com/inductees/1968/case.html|accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref> Before arriving at NC State, he spent two years as an assistant coach at the [[University of Southern California]] and spent several years coaching teams at various Naval bases during the war.<ref name=\"Menzer-29\">Menzer ''Four Corners'', p.29</ref> In February 1947, his first season at NC State, Case defeated [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] in Chapel Hill, 48\u201346 in overtime, beginning a streak of 15 consecutive victories over the Tar Heels. Later that month, an afternoon game in Thompson Gym against [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] was postponed by city fire officials because of overcrowding. That evening the game was officially canceled after fans were found sneaking through bathroom windows, breaking down doors, and hiding in the basement.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\">Media Guide, p. 102</ref> Less than three weeks later, Case guided the Red Terrors to their first Southern Conference championship in 18 years. Case and his team celebrated by performing an Indiana high school tradition of cutting down the nets. The tradition soon spread to college teams across the nation and survives amongst championship teams to this day.<ref name=\"nets\">{{cite web|title=Cutting down the nets part of winning fabric|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/tourney05/2005-03-23-trimming-nets_x.htm|last=Gluskin|first=Michael|publisher=USA Today|date=2005-03-23|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> Soon after his arrival, Case was named \"Tar Heel of the Week\" by the Raleigh ''[[News and Observer]]'', citing that \"since the little man came here from Indiana...basketball has almost supplanted politics as the favorite topic of discussion in the North Carolina capital.\"<ref name=\"Grundy-196\">Grundy ''Learning to Win'', p.196</ref> In Case's second season as head coach the team changed its nickname from the Red Terrors to the Wolfpack.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/>\n\nIn February 1948, Case made alterations to the design of the still incomplete Reynolds Coliseum. Attempting to usurp [[Duke University|Duke]]'s [[Cameron Indoor Stadium]] as the largest basketball arena in the area,<ref name=\"packpride\"/> Case insisted that the blueprints be changed to increase the maximum capacity from 9,000 seats to 12,400. Construction resumed later that month after a final shipment of steel arrived in Raleigh.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> Reynolds officially opened its doors on December 2, 1949, with a Wolfpack win over Washington & Lee, 67\u201347, in front of a crowd of 11,020.<ref name=\"Chappelow-59\">Chappelow ''Raleigh's Reynolds Coliseum'', p.59</ref> At that time, the arena was the largest college basketball facility in the southeast.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> Soon after Reynolds' opening, the ''[[Greensboro News & Record]]'' wrote that Raleigh had become \"the basketball capital of the world.

The Dixie Classic was a three-day tournament held each December until 1961 that matched the four [[Tobacco Road (rivalry)|Tobacco Road]] schools of NC State, North Carolina, Duke, and Wake Forest against four of the top teams from across the country.

NC State went on to defeat [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor]] in the third-place game, 53\u201341.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> The Wolfpack won its fifth consecutive Southern Conference title in 1951 and its sixth the following year. Both seasons ended in early exits from the NCAA Tournament, though. In 1951 State defeated [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]] in the first round before losing to [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]]. In 1952 the team lost in the first round to [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] and future North Carolina head coach [[Frank McGuire]].\n\nThe Wolfpack's six-year winning streak against North Carolina came to an end in January 1953, as the Wolfpack, ranked #17 in the country, lost to the unranked Tar Heels in Raleigh, 70\u201369.<ref>{{cite web|title=AP Ranking for Wednesday, January 2, 1952|url=http://www.sportsstats.com/AP/Ranking/19520102.html|publisher=SportStats.com|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref> It was the first match between the two schools since the hiring of Frank \"the man\" McGuire the previous summer. McGuire inflamed NC State players and fans by having his players cut down the nets in Reynolds Coliseum following the victory.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> Despite the loss, the Pack finished first in the conference at 13\u20133 but lost in the conference tournament championship game. The team was ranked 18th in the final AP poll of 1953 but was left out of the NCAA Tournament for the first time in four years.\n\n====The move to the ACC====\n\nBy the end of the 1952\u201353 season the Southern Conference had bloated to 17 members and was still seen as a football-centric conference. Maryland and Duke had become national football powers and there weren't many schools in the conference that could regularly compete against them. In an effort to create a more balanced round-robin schedule and thus secure an automatic bid to the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], the top eight football schools from the conference\u2014Maryland, Duke, UNC, Virginia, South Carolina, Clemson, Wake Forest, and NC State\u2014left to form the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].<ref name=\"Menzer-43-44\">Menzer ''Four Corners'', p.43\u201344</ref>\n\nNC State's first ACC contest was on the road against Wake Forest in December 1953. The Wolfpack was ranked #8 in the nation at the time, but just as in the first ever meeting between the two schools, Wake Forest prevailed. Case and his squad defeated the Demon Deacons later that season in the first-ever ACC Tournament championship game, 82\u201380 in overtime. The victory meant a return trip to the [[1954 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], where NC State defeated George Washington in the first round before losing to eventual champion La Salle in the second round. Case's squad won a second ACC title the following year, defeating Duke in 87\u201377 in the championship game. The team finished with a 28\u20134 record but was ineligible for postseason play; earlier in the season the NCAA imposed four years' probation and banned them from postseason play during that time for numerous recruiting violations.<ref>[https://web1.ncaa.org/LSDBi/exec/miSearch?miSearchSubmit=publicReport&key=29&publicTerms=THIS%20PHRASE%20WILL%20NOT%20BE%20REPEATED 1956 infraction report]</ref> The Wolfpack brought home a third consecutive ACC title in the 1955\u201356 season, setting a record for consecutive ACC championships that stood until 2002. The team also played in its first televised game earlier that season, losing to North Carolina in Chapel Hill, 73\u201369.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> State struggled in the 1956\u201357 season, finishing fifth in the conference for the first time under Case.  State's loss in the first round of that year's [[1957 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]] also marked the first time that Case did not lead his team to the conference championship game. To add insult to injury, bitter rival North Carolina brought the ACC its first national championship.  The team finished third in 1958 and was ranked 20th in the nation at the season's end but again lost early in the [[1958 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]], this time to North Carolina in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe 1958 Dixie Classic brought to Reynolds Coliseum some of the most talented teams ever assembled for the tournament. Included in the field were eight players who eventually earned All-American honors, including NC State's [[Lou Pucillo]] and [[John Richter]], North Carolina's Lee Shaffer, York Larese, and Doug Moe, [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]]'s [[Oscar Robertson]], [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]]'s [[Johnny Green (basketball)|Johnny Green]], and [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]]'s [[Don Goldstein]]. Later that season, NC State, ranked #10 in the nation, defeated North Carolina, ranked #5, 80\u201356 to win their fourth ACC championship in six seasons.  However, due to the 1956 sanctions, they were ineligible for the NCAA Tournament. The Pack finished the season ranked #6 with a 22\u20134 record.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/>\n\n====Case's final years====\nThe 1959\u201360 Wolfpack team finished with an 11\u201315 record, marking Case's first losing season in Raleigh. The team finished fourth in the ACC in 1961 and third in 1962 but lost in the first round of the conference tournament both seasons. In the summer of 1962, Case, then 62 years old, hired his former player and then Clemson head coach [[Press Maravich]] to be his top assistant. Case's health began to deteriorate rapidly over the following two seasons as the Wolfpack finished fifth in the ACC in 1963 and seventh in 1964. The seventh-place finish was the lowest of Case's tenure and would prove to be his last. On December 7, 1964, just two games into the season, Everett Case retired and named Maravich as his successor.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> During his tenure, Case won six Southern Conference titles, four ACC titles, and qualified for the NCAA Tournament twice. His overall record of 377\u2013134 remains the best in NC State history.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nMaravich led the Pack to second-place finish in the conference and an ACC championship, its first in six years.

On April 30, 1966, the day after Maravich announced that he was leaving, Everett Case died while in a Raleigh hospital.\n\n===Norm Sloan era (1967\u20131980)===\nJust a week after Maravich's exit, former Wolfpack basketball and football player [[Norm Sloan]] was hired as the new head coach. In 1967\u201368, his first season, Sloan's team finished the regular season third in the ACC with a 9\u20135 conference record.<ref name=\"media-guide-103\">Media Guide, p. 103</ref> State made it as far as the ACC championship game before losing to North Carolina 87\u201350, but it was the Pack's semifinal game against tenth-ranked Duke that is most remembered. Sloan realized that his team was vastly undersized against the Blue Devils. He decided, however, to use the Wolfpack's quickness to its advantage and keep the ball away from the Duke players for as much of the game as possible. Using a tactic he coined \"stall-ball,\" Sloan instructed his players to hold the ball at halfcourt and slow the game down as much as possible. The final result was the lowest scoring game in ACC Tournament history. Duke led 4\u20132 at halftime and the Wolfpack held the ball for more than 13 straight minutes in the second half. In the end, State prevailed 12\u201310.<ref name=\"stall-ball\">{{cite web|last=Fowler|first=Scott|title=Integrating the ACC, one player at a time|url=http://www.charlotte.com/759/story/533647.html|publisher=Charlotte.com|date=2008-03-12|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref>\n\nThe following season marked another historic first in the Wolfpack program, as on December 2, 1968, Al Heartly debuted as the school's first African-American basketball player.

The team finished the regular season at 23\u20137 overall and third in the conference. In the conference championship game, the Pack defeated third-ranked [[South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball|South Carolina]] 42\u201339 in double overtime.<ref name=\"media-guide-103\"/> With the victory, the Wolfpack was invited to its first NCAA Tournament in five years. State received a bye in the first round of the tournament and lost its first game to St. Bonaventure in the semifinals, 80\u201368. In the Eastern Regional third-place game, the Pack defeated Niagara, 108\u201388. Despite State's quick exit from the tournament, Sloan's squad finished the season ranked tenth in the AP poll, its first end-of-the-season ranking since being ranked sixth following the 1958\u201359 season.\n\nDuring the spring of 1970, just after the season's end, Sloan signed [[Tom Burleson]]. Burleson, a 7'4\" native of [[Newland, NC]], was the first major player of the Wolfpack squad that would have a combined record of 57\u20131 during the 1972\u201373 and 1973\u201374 seasons to be signed. The following spring, Sloan signed the remaining pieces of the 1974 championship nucleus, 6'4\" [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]], 5'7\" point guard [[Monte Towe]], and 6'7\" power forward [[Tim Stoddard]].<ref name=\"media-guide-103\"/> At the time, the NCAA prohibited freshmen from competing on varsity squads and the team struggled in the following two seasons, finishing seventh in the ACC in 1970\u201371 and fifth in 1971\u201372. At 13\u201314 overall, the 1970\u201371 season was Sloan's worst and his only losing season as the Wolfpack head coach.\n\nWith the addition of Thompson, Towe, and Stoddard to the starting lineup in 1972\u201373, the team rebounded quickly from its recent struggles.

Ranked second nationally in the first AP poll of the season,<ref>{{cite web|title=AP History of North Carolina State|url=http://www.sportsstats.com/AP/NorthCarolinaState.html|publisher=SportsStats.com|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref> the team was poised to make another strong run. State began the season with a pair of games against [[East Carolina Pirates men's basketball|East Carolina]] and [[Vermont Catamounts men's basketball|Vermont]], which it won by a combined score of 176\u201387. The third game of the season was against seven-time defending national champions [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] and coach [[John Wooden]]. The Pack came out sluggish and was easily defeated, 84\u201366. It would prove to be the team's only loss in two seasons, though, as the Pack tore through the ACC, finishing the regular season at 24\u20131 overall.<ref name=\"sportsstats-sched\">{{cite web|title=NC State Schedule and Results|url=http://www.sportsstats.com/bball/game.results/NCSU|publisher=SportsStats.com|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref> As the team continued to rack up victories, its national ranking rose accordingly. On February 19, with just four regular season games remaining, NC State overtook UCLA for the top spot in the AP poll; it was the program's first ever #1 ranking.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nAs the top seed in the conference tournament, the Wolfpack received a bye in the first round. In the semifinals State easily defeated Virginia, 87\u201366. In the championship game the team faced off against fourth-ranked Maryland, which had lost by only six points in each of the teams' regular season meetings. Maryland jumped to an early 25\u201312 lead, hitting 12 of its first 14 shots. The Wolfpack cut the deficit to five points at halftime, but momentum shifted throughout the second half. NC State led by four late in the game, but Maryland closed the gap and sent the game to overtime, tied at 97. The Wolfpack, led by Tom Burleson's 38 points, won 103\u2013100 in what has been heralded as one of the greatest college basketball games ever played.<ref name=\"greatest-game\">{{cite web|title=College basketball's greatest games|url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/games/ncb.html|publisher=ESPN.com|date=1999-12-27|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref><ref name=\"media-guide-107\">Media Guide, p. 107</ref>\n\nBack in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in four seasons, Sloan and his team played their first two games on their home court. They defeated their first two opponents, Providence and Pittsburgh, by a combined 32 points to set up a Final Four rematch with UCLA. In the week leading up to the game, thousands of fans packed Reynolds Coliseum to watch the Wolfpack practice. When the two teams finally met in [[Greensboro, NC|Greensboro]], it was another tight contest for the Pack. After ending regulation tied at 65, each team scored only two points in the first overtime. UCLA took a seven-point lead in the second extra period, but NC State led by David Thompson, took the lead for the final time with 34 seconds to play. State went on to win, 80\u201377, and advanced to the national championship game against [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]].<ref name=\"media-guide-109\">Media Guide, p. 109</ref>\n\nThe championship game, played two nights later, was much less competitive than the previous contest. The game was close in the first half until Marquette coach [[Al McGuire]] received two technical fouls and was ejected from the game. McGuire's exit sparked a 10\u20130 Wolfpack run just before halftime. NC State led by as much as 19 points in the second half and ultimately won, 76\u201364.<ref name=\"media-guide-109\"/>\n\nThompson left NC State after his senior season in 1975 as the school's most decorated player. He won every major national player of the year award in 1975, in addition to being a three-time consensus First-Team All-America honoree, a three-time unanimous First-Team All-ACC honoree, and a three-time ACC Player of the Year winner.<ref name=\"award-winners\">{{cite web|title=ACC Award Winners 1954\u20132002|url=http://www.sportsstats.com/bball/awards/index.html|publisher=Charlie Board's ACC Stats Archive|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> In his 86 games, Thompson scored 2,309 points (26.8 ppg);<ref name=\"Thompson-stats\">{{cite web|title=David Thompson individual stats|url=http://www.sportsstats.com/bball/individual.stats/player_stats/player1864.txt|publisher=Charlie Board's ACC Stats Archive|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> he still holds the Wolfpack records for points scored in a single season (838 in 1974\u201375) and points scored in a single game (57 in 1974). His #44 jersey remains the only retired jersey in NC State history, though others have been honored.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nSloan remained head coach through the 1979\u201380 season. His last team (1979\u201380) team reached the NCAA Tournament, losing to Iowa in the second round. Also, twice during his final six seasons in Raleigh his teams played in the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]]. In 1976, the Pack advanced to the [[1976 National Invitation Tournament|semifinals]] and in 1978, it defeated [[South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball|South Carolina]], Detroit, and [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] before falling to [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] in the [[1978 National Invitation Tournament|championship game]]. In his final season, he led the program to its 1000th victory.

Whittenburg returned to the court in time for the [[1983 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]], which most believed the Pack needed to win in order to secure a second consecutive berth in the NCAA Tournament. State did just that, defeating heavily favored North Carolina and [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia]] squads led by [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Ralph Sampson]], respectively. The Wolfpack kept winning. Their close games and exciting finishes in the ACC Tournament and early rounds of the NCAA tournament earned them the moniker The Cardiac Pack.  As a #6 seed in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], the Wolfpack won narrow victories over Pepperdine (in double overtime) and UNLV (71\u201370) before defeating [[Utah Utes men's basketball|Utah]] in the Sweet Sixteen, 75\u201356. In the regional final, NC State again defeated Virginia, 63\u201362, then defeated [[Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball|Georgia]] in the Final Four to advance to the championship game against [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|Houston]]. The Cougars, nicknamed [[Phi Slama Jama]] for their athletic, fast-paced style of play that featured [[Clyde Drexler]] and [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], were expected to win easily over the underdog Wolfpack. NC State escaped with their second national title after a last-second air ball by Dereck Whittenburg was caught and dunked by [[Lorenzo Charles]].<ref name=\"packpride\"/> The 54\u201352 final is one of the most famous in college basketball history.[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/basketball/men/02tourney/greatest-games.htm]\n\nValvano's 1984 team finished 7th in the ACC and lost in the first round of the [[1984 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] to future conference foe [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]]. The following season, with the addition of guard [[Vinny Del Negro]], the Pack began a run of five consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament. The Pack reached the Elite Eight in [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1985]] and [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1986]] and the Sweet Sixteen in [[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1989]]. In 1987, after a sixth-place finish in the regular season, NC State made another surprising run through the [[1987 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]]. In the championship game, State defeated rival North Carolina, which had gone undefeated in conference play. It was the program's last ACC championship to date. State finished second in the conference the following year and was a #3 seed in the [[1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. The team made an early exit, though, losing to #14 seed [[Murray State Racers men's basketball|Murray State]] in the first round.<ref name=\"packpride\"/>\n\nValvano's final season in Raleigh was mired in controversy after the release of the book, ''Personal Fouls'', written by Peter Golenbock. In the book, Golenbock alleged improper practices and a lack of institutional control in the NC State athletics department. The allegations included grade fixing, lowered or waived entrance requirements for athletes, the selling of tickets and sneakers by athletes, and frequent drug use by athletes.<ref name=\"personal-fouls\">{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Kent|title='Personal Fouls' Is Defended|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DF1F3DF93BA15752C0A966958260|publisher=New York Times|date=1990-01-28|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> The claims were refuted by Valvano and Chancellor [[Bruce Poulton]], claiming that some of the players might have sold some of their shoes, most notably to ACC superfan Jason Bass. The NCAA investigation, and 5 additional investigations by separate entities found only that players indeed sold shoes and their complimentary game tickets for spending money. Nonetheless, the NCAA banned NC State from postseason play for the 1989-90 season. Earlier, NC State limited itself to only 12 total scholarships for 1990-91 and 1991-92. Although Valvano was not named in the NCAA report at all, new chancellor [[Larry Monteith]] forced his resignation on April 7, 1990.<ref name=\"packpride\"/><ref>[https://web3.ncaa.org/lsdbi/search/miCaseView/report?id=101719 1989 infractions report]</ref>\n\n===Les Robinson era (1990\u20131996)===\nTo replace Valvano, NC State turned to [[East Tennessee State Buccaneers men's basketball|East Tennessee State]] coach [[Les Robinson]], who had played for Case in the 1960s. Robinson was the 1991 District Coach of the Year as selected by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) after leading NC State to a 20\u201311 record in the first season.  He was the first first-year coach in ACC history to win 20 games, post a winning regular season conference record, and win games in both the ACC and NCAA Tournaments.  The only other coach to pull off this feat is North Carolina's [[Bill Guthridge]].\n\nHowever, the lost scholarships took their full effect a year later, and the Wolfpack plummeted into the ACC's second division for the next five years. The low point of Robinson's tenure at his alma mater came during the 1992\u201393 season. Due to injuries and academic-related suspensions, Robinson was only able to dress seven players for most conference games.  They ultimately finished 8\u201319, the worst record in modern Wolfpack history.\n\nIn 1992 the ACC Tournament was expanded because of the addition of Florida State. A play-in game between the eighth and ninth place teams was created, and during his five years as the N.C. State coach after its addition, Robinson's Wolfpack played in the play-in game four out of five times (finishing seventh in 1992). Because of his team's traditional appearance in the Thursday night play-in game, the game became known as the \"Les Robinson Invitational\" by ACC fans. The play-in game was discontinued when the ACC expanded to include Miami and Virginia Tech, and required three Thursday games. With the later addition of Boston College, there are now four games on Thursday.\n\nLes Robinson would stay on as head coach through the 1995\u201396 season.  While he never tallied another winning record, his stint went a long way towards cleansing the image of the program to both insiders and outsiders.<ref name=\"packpride\"/> Robinson was appointed NC State's athletic director in 1996 and stepped down as head coach. He left to become The Citadel's athletic director in 2000.\n\n===Herb Sendek era (1996\u20132006)===\n[[File:RBC Center.jpg|right|thumb|[[PNC Arena]], which opened in 1999, is the current home of Wolfpack basketball.]]\n[[Herb Sendek|Sendek]] was hired at NC State in 1996 after three years of success at Miami (Ohio), his first head coaching experience. He immediately improved upon the Les Robinson era, winning 17 games for the program's first winning record in six years. In his first year at NC State, the Wolfpack also finished the year winning eight of 11 games, advanced to the finals of the ACC Tournament, and earned a trip to the postseason in the NIT.\n\nSendek coached NC State to the NCAA tournament five consecutive years from 2002 until 2006 (tying the school record). He had his most success during these last five years, winning his 100th game at NC State in 2002 and having a winning conference record in each year but one. In 2004, Sendek won ACC Coach of the Year and Julius Hodge, one of Sendek's most prized recruits during his NC State tenure, won the ACC Men's Basketball Player of the Year. In 2005, NC State upset defending champion Connecticut in the second round of the NCAA tournament to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, NC State's deepest run into the tournament during Sendek's years. Sendek finished his NC State coaching career with a 71\u201388 record in the ACC and a 32\u201387 record against RPI top 50 teams.  On April 3, 2006, Sendek accepted the head coaching job at Arizona State.\n\n===Sidney Lowe era (2006\u20132011)===\n[[Sidney Lowe]] was named head coach in May 2006 after a month-long search that included such targets as [[Rick Barnes]], [[John Beilein]], [[John Calipari]], and [[Steve Lavin]].<ref name=\"lowe-hire\">{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Andy|title=Sources: Pistons' Lowe agrees to coach North Carolina State|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=2433439|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2006-05-05|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> Lowe's first season got off to a good start as the Wolfpack won its first five games.

He returned to Raleigh in 2006 to replace Herb Sendek as coach, but the Wolfpack struggled to sustain any momentum in Lowe's five seasons. Although he made the NIT twice, he never made the NCAA tournament as a coach, and never finished higher than ninth place in the ACC. He went 86\u201378, including just 25\u201355 in ACC play. Lowe was 3\u201316 record against rivals Duke and North Carolina, with two of those wins coming in his first year.\n\nLowe also spent five years as an NBA head coach in Minnesota and Memphis, compiling a 79\u2013228 record.\n\n===Mark Gottfried era (2011\u20132017)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was named head coach on April 5, 2011. In his first season as head coach of NC State, [[Mark Gottfried]] recorded a 22\u201312 overall regular season record, including a 9\u20137 regular season record in the ACC, and reached the semifinals of the ACC tournament. [[Mark Gottfried]] recorded the second best season by a first-year coach at State, second only to [[Everett Case]]. Gottfried's first Wolfpack team earned a #11 seed in the 2012 NCAA Tournament. The Pack won in the tournament over sixth seeded [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball|San Diego State]] and third seeded [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, where it lost to second seeded Kansas. They finished the season ranked #20 in the AP Poll.\n\nEntering the 2012\u201313 season, expectations ran high for Gottfried's second season as head coach. The Wolfpack returned four starters from its 2012 Sweet Sixteen squad and were joined by a trio of talented freshman, each of whom were selected as [[McDonald's All-American Game|McDonald's All Americans]]. As a result, NC State started the season ranked #6 in the AP preseason poll, the Wolfpack's second-highest preseason ranking in program history. Additionally, NC State was voted as preseason favorite to win the ACC title in the conference's annual media survey and the inaugural league coaches\u2019 poll. Ultimately, [[2012\u201313 NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team|the team]] did not live up to media expectations. 24\u201311 overall, The Wolfpack finished tied for fourth in the ACC regular season standings with a 24\u201311 overall record (11\u20137 ACC) and as a #8 seed lost its first game in the second round of the 2013 NCAA tournament to [[2012-13 Temple Owls men's basketball team|Temple]].\n\nMark Gottfried began his third season as head coach of the Wolfpack having lost five of seven players who logged significant minutes (four of which were starters). They struggled for most of the season, finishing 9\u20139 in ACC play. However, the Wolfpack surprised many by making the semifinals of the ACC tournament by upsetting #11 [[2013-14 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]], who entered the tournament as a second seed. They eventually lost to a third seeded Duke team. They were selected as a #12 seed in the 2014 NCAA tournament, where they won over [[2013-14 Xavier Musketeers men's basketball team|Xavier]] in the First Four before losing in the second round to St. Louis. They finished the season 22\u201314.\n\nComing into Gottfried's fourth season, NC State had lost [[T.J. Warren]], the ACC's leading scorer the previous year, to the NBA draft. They also lost point guard Tyler Lewis, who transferred to [[Butler University|Butler]]. They finished 19\u201312 with a 10\u20138 ACC record. NC State upset [[Jahlil Okafor]] and #2 [[2014-15 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] on January 11, nearly two years after upsetting them in the same place in 2013. They also upset #15 [[2014-15 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|UNC]] in the Dean Smith Center for the first time since 2003, holding the Heels to their lowest home point total ever. These two wins, along with wins against [[2014-15 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]] and [[2014-15 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]] made Gottfried the first coach to beat all ACC Hall of Fame coaches in the same year. They made it to the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament where they lost to Duke, and were selected as an 8 seed in the NCAA tournament where they made the Sweet Sixteen, upsetting #1 [[2014-15 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]] along the way.\n\nIn Gottfried's fifth season, NC State lost half of its scoring threat with [[Trevor Lacey]] declaring for the draft and Ralston Turner and Desmond Lee graduating. Additionally, Kyle Washington transferred to the [[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]]. NC State suffered a loss in their opening game against [[2015-16 William & Mary Tribe men's basketball team|William & Mary]], and highly touted guard Terry Henderson suffered an ankle injury in the first 10 minutes, which resulted in him sitting out for the rest of the season. This was the beginning of a long and painful season for the Pack. NC State struggled to compete in the ACC after going 10\u20133 out of conference. Junior point guard, [[Anthony Barber (basketball)|Anthony \"Cat\" Barber]] finished the season as the ACC's leading scorer, averaging 23.5 points per game and making the All-ACC first team. After a tough loss to [[2015-16 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] in the second round of the ACC Tournament, NC State finished the season 16\u201317 and 5\u201313 in the ACC, making it Gottfried's worst season to date. The Wolfpack decided to not participate in any post-season tournaments.\n\nExpectations ran high for Gottfried's sixth season as head coach, with a highly touted recruiting class and several key players returning such as [[Abdul-Malik Abu]] and [[BeeJay Anya]]. It was later announced that he would be fired at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/nc-state-s-gottfried-will-not-return-next-season/16533628/ | title=NC State's

In the game players can re-enact the four major historical battles in [[Napoleon]]'s [[Waterloo campaign]] (The [[Battle of Ligny]], [[Battle of Quatre-Bras]], [[Battle of Waterloo]] and the [[Battle of Wavre]]), as well play two hypothetical battles (at [[Nivelles]] and Wagnee) which would have possibly taken place had some of the pre-campaign maneuvering been done differently. The battles in the game are fought in real-time, and strive to create a sense of realism. It is based on a series of tabletop games of the same name.\n\n==References==\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in July 1994 rated ''Fields of Glory'' three stars out of five. The reviewer praised the in-game database as \"one of the best orders of battle ever developed for the computer, and almost justifies the game's purchase by itself\", and the accurate terrain.

In the game players can re-enact the four major historical battles in [[Napoleon]]'s [[Waterloo campaign]] (The [[Battle of Ligny]], [[Battle of Quatre-Bras]], [[Battle of Waterloo]] and the [[Battle of Wavre]]), as well play two hypothetical battles (at [[Nivelles]] and [[Wagnee]]) which would have possibly taken place had some of the pre-campaign maneuvering been done differently. The battles in the game are fought in real-time, and strive to create a sense of realism. It is based on a series of tabletop games of the same name.\n\n==References==\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in July 1994 rated ''Fields of Glory'' three stars out of five. The reviewer praised the in-game database as \"one of the best orders of battle ever developed for the computer, and almost justifies the game's purchase by itself\", and the accurate terrain. He criticized the \"incapable\" AI, and real-time combat as being too fast at brigade level and too slow at corps level; as the game required both levels to win, he said that the Waterloo battle was too large to manage.

The twenty-two chapters of ''.hack//Legend of the Twilight'' appeared as a [[serial (literature)|serial]] in the Japanese magazine ''[[Comptiq]]'', and published in three ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' by [[Kadokawa Shoten]] from July 2002 to April 2004. Set in a fictional [[MMORPG]], ''[[The World (.hack)|The World]]'', the series focuses on twins Rena and Shugo, who receive chibi [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]]s in the design of the legendary .hackers known as [[Kite (.hack)|Kite]] and [[BlackRose (.hack)|BlackRose]]. After Shugo is given the Twilight Bracelet by a mysterious girl, the two embark on a quest to find Aura and unravel the mystery of the Twilight Bracelet.\n\nThe series was adapted into a twelve episode [[anime]] of the same name directed by [[Koichi Mashimo]] and [[Koji Sawai]], and produced by [[Bee Train]].\n\n[[Tokyopop]] licensed the manga series for an English-language release in North America. It published the three volumes from September 2003 to April 2004. [[Bandai Entertainment]] had licensed the anime series for North American broadcast. The word \"Bracelet\" in the title was removed in North America, shortening the title to ''.hack//Legend of the Twilight''. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment, [[Funimation]] announced at [[San Diego Comic Con|SDCC]] 2013, that they have acquired 4 .hack titles including Legend of the Twilight.<ref>{{cite web|title=Funimation Adds 4 .hack Anime|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-07-18/funimation-adds-4-.hack-anime|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of .hack characters}}\nSet in a fictional MMORPG called ''[[The World (.hack)|The World]]'', the series follows twins [[Shugo (.hack)|Shugo]] and [[Rena (.hack)|Rena]]. After winning a contest, Rena is given a pair of chibi avatars in the design of the legendary .hackers, [[Kite (.hack)|Kite]] and [[BlackRose (.hack)|BlackRose]].<ref group=\"notes\">The story takes place sometime between 2011 and 2014, after the conclusion of the original ''.hack'' games and during the period when Aura had become the \"Ultimate AI\" in order to take over management of ''The World''. The ''.hack//G.U.'' backstory videos within ''Terminal Disc'' reveal that Aura, not CC Corp, organized the contest that granted Shugo and Rena their avatars.</ref> After an odd occurrence, a mysterious [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] named [[Aura (.hack)|Aura]] gives Shugo the Twilight Bracelet, an item that both aids and hinders him. Rena and Shugo embark on an adventure to find Aura and unravel the mystery of the Twilight Bracelet.\n\nAlong the way, Shugo and Rena befriend Mireille, a rare item hunter; the fierce Ouka;<ref group=\"notes\">Tokyopop's first printing of the first volume of the manga referred to Ouka as \"Orca\" (the name of a [[Orca (.hack)|different character]] in the ''.hack'' continuity).</ref> and Hotaru, a peaceful girl. While waiting for an event to start, they encounter a strange girl named Zefie, who is lured to Shugo because she believes the bracelet smells like her mother, Aura. It is later realized that Zefie is a vagrant AI \u2013 an AI that acts independently outside the parameters of the game. Zefie's presence upsets many, including the Cobalt Knights, a group of administrators that follow the rule \"If you can't control it, delete it\" to an extreme.\n\nMeanwhile, Balmung, another administrator in ''The World,'' encounters problems of his own. The suits, CC Corp's upper tier executives, are displeased with what little action Balmung has taken against Shugo and his illegal item, the Twilight Bracelet. Balmung's administrative duties are revoked.\n\nKamui, the leader of the Cobalt Knights, begins her pursuit of Shugo and company. She captures Shugo and his friends, but allows Mireille, Ouka, and Hotaru to leave after they promise they will not interfere with the workings of ''The World.'' Shugo, Rena, and Zefie are left in a cell together. Rena and Shugo disagree over whether to stay until the end. After they come to an agreement to stay and fight, Zefie opens the door to the cell, freeing them.\n\nIn the outside world, Ouka, Hotaru, and Mireille decide to return to ''The World'' and help Shugo. Kazu, a friend of Balmung, meets up with Shugo and party, carrying \"Helba's Key,\" the key to an area called the Net Slums. Kamui shows up, demanding the key to the Net Slums with her knights in tow. Shugo and Kamui face off, which results in Kamui breaking her axe. Zefie tells her that everyone in ''The World'' is blessed. Shugo activates Helba's key and transports himself, Rena, Mireille, Hotaru, and Zefie to the Net Slums. Once at the Net Slums, the party is confronted by Balmung, refuses to allow the party to proceed to Aura unless Shugo can damage him. Shugo struggles, but manages to strike Balmung. Pleased, Balmung hands Shugo the virus cores he'll need to see Aura; he also explains that only three people can go see Aura. Hotaru and Mireille say their goodbyes to Zefie, Shugo, and Rena as they activate the virus cores and meet Aura. The manga ends with Zefie being reunited with her mother, and Shugo telling Aura of his adventures in ''The World''.\n\n===Anime===\nThe anime has many differences from the manga, though the story begins in much the same way. Rena wins a limited edition character model contest for ''The World'' and invites her twin brother Shugo to play the legendary character [[Kite (.hack)|Kite]] while she plays as the legendary BlackRose. On their first outing together, Shugo is killed by a monster, but is revived by a mysterious girl named Aura. As well as reviving Shugo, Aura gives him a mysterious bracelet. Shugo and Rena continue to play \"The World\" and find many warped monsters. They eventually meet new friends, Mireille, Ouka, Hotaru and Sanjuro. However, while searching through a haunted mansion, Rena disappears and falls into a coma. Shugo and Rena's friends frantically search for a solution, while a group of children plan something terrible. The Cerulean Knights, a [[debugging]] team for CC Corp, hinder the situation by trying to capture Shugo because of his bracelet. When Shugo and company reach a mysterious place where Rena might be, they are met by a hostile AI named Morti. Using the bracelet and a little help from an inside ally, the group locates the source of the problem and proceed to stop it. They transport themselves to a root town that is not open to the public yet, where Shugo manages to defeat the AI; however, due to some of the programming of the AI, ''The World'' will be destroyed. Shugo and Rena then activate [[Kite (.hack)|Kite]] and [[Blackrose (.hack)|Blackrose's]] joint power to save ''The World.''\n\n==Production==\nRei Izumi  describes ''.hack//Legend of the Twilight'' as \"the story of the future\" and \"the first to usher in the ''.hack'' franchise and the last to end.\"<ref name=\"Vol. 3 265\u20149\"/> The series took Izumi and Tatsuya Hamazaki three and a half years to complete; ''.hack//Legend of the Twilight '' was originally planned to be two volumes long, but a decision was made to extend the series. As a result, the original story was rewritten.<ref name=\"Vol. 3 265\u20149\"/> Additionally, the scene with Kamui and Zefie was extended. Kamui was originally male, her axe was not broken, and her role ended after she tossed away Grunty.<ref name=\"Vol. 3 265\u20149\"/> Despite this, Izumi wanted to include more of Kamui and Balmung in the series.<ref name=\"Vol. 3 265\u20149\"/>\n\nIzumi and Hamazaki created Reki, Balmung's assistant, and Magi, Kamui's assistant, as they were deciding on character names; the two were not in the original draft of ''.hack//Legend of the Twilight''. Reki was invented because Izumi and Hamazaki needed a character for Balmung to communicate with. Izumi suggested Reki and Tatsuya offered Magi for the names of the two assistants.<ref name=\"Vol. 3 265\u20149\">{{cite book|title=.hack//Legend of the Twilight Volume

The twenty-two chapters of ''.hack//Legend of the Twilight'' appeared as a [[serial (literature)|serial]] in the Japanese magazine ''[[Comptiq]]'', and published in three ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' by [[Kadokawa Shoten]] from July 2002 to April 2004. Set in a fictional [[MMORPG]], ''[[The World (.hack)|The World]]'', the series focuses on twins Rena and Shugo, who receive chibi [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]]s in the design of the legendary .hackers known as [[Kite (.hack)|Kite]] and [[BlackRose (.hack)|BlackRose]]. After Shugo is given the Twilight Bracelet by a mysterious girl, the two embark on a quest to find Aura and unravel the mystery of the Twilight Bracelet.\n\nThe series was adapted into a twelve episode [[anime]] of the same name directed by [[Koichi Mashimo]] and [[Koji Sawai]], and produced by [[Bee Train]].\n\n[[Tokyopop]] licensed the manga series for an English-language release in North America. It published the three volumes from September 2003 to April 2004. [[Bandai Entertainment]] had licensed the anime series for North American broadcast. The word \"Bracelet\" in the title was removed in North America, shortening the title to ''.hack//Legend of the Twilight''. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment, [[Funimation]] announced at [[San Diego Comic Con|SDCC]] 2013, that they have acquired 4 .hack titles including Legend of the Twilight.<ref>{{cite web|title=Funimation Adds 4 .hack Anime|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-07-18/funimation-adds-4-.hack-anime|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of .hack characters}}\nSet in a fictional MMORPG called ''[[The World (.hack)|The World]]'', the series follows twins [[Shugo (.hack)|Shugo]] and [[Rena (.hack)|Rena]]. After winning a contest, Rena is given a pair of chibi avatars in the design of the legendary .hackers, [[Kite (.hack)|Kite]] and [[BlackRose (.hack)|BlackRose]].<ref group=\"notes\">The story takes place sometime between 2011 and 2014, after the conclusion of the original ''.hack'' games and during the period when Aura had become the \"Ultimate AI\" in order to take over management of ''The World''. The ''.hack//G.U.'' backstory videos within ''Terminal Disc'' reveal that Aura, not CC Corp, organized the contest that granted Shugo and Rena their avatars.</ref> After an odd occurrence, a mysterious [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] named [[Aura (.hack)|Aura]] gives Shugo the Twilight Bracelet, an item that both aids and hinders him. Rena and Shugo embark on an adventure to find Aura and unravel the mystery of the Twilight Bracelet.\n\nAlong the way, Shugo and Rena befriend Mireille, a rare item hunter; the fierce Ouka;<ref group=\"notes\">Tokyopop's first printing of the first volume of the manga referred to Ouka as \"Orca\" (the name of a [[Orca (.hack)|different character]] in the ''.hack'' continuity).</ref> and Hotaru, a peaceful girl. While waiting for an event to start, they encounter a strange girl named Zefie, who is lured to Shugo because she believes the bracelet smells like her mother, Aura. It is later realized that Zefie is a vagrant AI \u2013 an AI that acts independently outside the parameters of the game. Zefie's presence upsets many, including the Cobalt Knights, a group of administrators that follow the rule \"If you can't control it, delete it\" to an extreme.\n\nMeanwhile, Balmung, another administrator in ''The World,'' encounters problems of his own. The suits, CC Corp's upper tier executives, are displeased with what little action Balmung has taken against Shugo and his illegal item, the Twilight Bracelet. Balmung's administrative duties are revoked.\n\nKamui, the leader of the Cobalt Knights, begins her pursuit of Shugo and company. She captures Shugo and his friends, but allows Mireille, Ouka, and Hotaru to leave after they promise they will not interfere with the workings of ''The World.'' Shugo, Rena, and Zefie are left in a cell together. Rena and Shugo disagree over whether to stay until the end. After they come to an agreement to stay and fight, Zefie opens the door to the cell, freeing them.\n\nIn the outside world, Ouka, Hotaru, and Mireille decide to return to ''The World'' and help Shugo. Kazu, a friend of Balmung, meets up with Shugo and party, carrying \"Helba's Key,\" the key to an area called the Net Slums. Kamui shows up, demanding the key to the Net Slums with her knights in tow. Shugo and Kamui face off, which results in Kamui breaking her axe. Zefie tells her that everyone in ''The World'' is blessed. Shugo activates Helba's key and transports himself, Rena, Mireille, Hotaru, and Zefie to the Net Slums. Once at the Net Slums, the party is confronted by Balmung, refuses to allow the party to proceed to Aura unless Shugo can damage him. Shugo struggles, but manages to strike Balmung. Pleased, Balmung hands Shugo the virus cores he'll need to see Aura; he also explains that only three people can go see Aura. Hotaru and Mireille say their goodbyes to Zefie, Shugo, and Rena as they activate the virus cores and meet Aura. The manga ends with Zefie being reunited with her mother, and Shugo telling Aura of his adventures in ''The World''.\n\n===Anime===\nThe anime has many differences from the manga, though the story begins in much the same way. Rena wins a limited edition character model contest for ''The World'' and invites her twin brother Shugo to play the legendary character [[Kite (.hack)|Kite]] while she plays as the legendary BlackRose. On their first outing together, Shugo is killed by a monster, but is revived by a mysterious girl named Aura. As well as reviving Shugo, Aura gives him a mysterious bracelet. Shugo and Rena continue to play \"The World\" and find many warped monsters. They eventually meet new friends, Mireille, Ouka, Hotaru and Sanjuro. However, while searching through a haunted mansion, Rena disappears and falls into a coma. Shugo and Rena's friends frantically search for a solution, while a group of children plan something terrible. The Cerulean Knights, a [[debugging]] team for CC Corp, hinder the situation by trying to capture Shugo because of his bracelet. When Shugo and company reach a mysterious place where Rena might be, they are met by a hostile AI named Morti. Using the bracelet and a little help from an inside ally, the group locates the source of the problem and proceed to stop it. They transport themselves to a root town that is not open to the public yet, where Shugo manages to defeat the AI; however, due to some of the programming of the AI, ''The World'' will be destroyed. Shugo and Rena then activate [[Kite (.hack)|Kite]] and [[Blackrose (.hack)|Blackrose's]] joint power to save ''The World.''\n\n==Production==\nRei Izumi  describes ''.hack//Legend of the Twilight'' as \"the story of the future\" and \"the first to usher in the ''.hack'' franchise and the last to end.\"<ref name=\"Vol. 3 265\u20149\"/> The series took Izumi and Tatsuya Hamazaki three and a half years to complete; ''.hack//Legend of the Twilight '' was originally planned to be two volumes long, but a decision was made to extend the series. As a result, the original story was rewritten.<ref name=\"Vol. 3 265\u20149\"/> Additionally, the scene with Kamui and Zefie was extended. Kamui was originally male, her axe was not broken, and her role ended after she tossed away Grunty.<ref name=\"Vol. 3 265\u20149\"/> Despite this, Izumi wanted to include more of Kamui and Balmung in the series.<ref name=\"Vol. 3 265\u20149\"/>\n\nIzumi and Hamazaki created Reki, Balmung's assistant, and Magi, Kamui's assistant, as they were deciding on character names; the two were not in the original draft of ''.hack//Legend of the Twilight''. Reki was invented because Izumi and Hamazaki needed a character for Balmung to communicate with. Izumi suggested Reki and Tatsuya offered Magi for the names of the two assistants.<ref name=\"Vol. 3 265\u20149\">{{cite book|title=.hack//Legend of the Twilight Volume

It is a [[bicameral]] body: the [[upper house|upper chamber]], the [[Maryland State Senate]], has 47 representatives and the [[lower house|lower chamber]], the [[Maryland House of Delegates]], has 141 representatives.  Members of both houses serve four-year terms. Each house elects its own officers, judges the qualifications and election of its own members, establishes rules for the conduct of its business, and may punish or expel its own members.\n\nThe General Assembly meets each year for 90 days to act on more than 2,300 bills including the state's annual budget, which it must pass before [[adjournment sine die|adjourning ''sine die'']].  The General Assembly's 438th session convened on January 10, 2018.\n\n==History==\nThe forerunner of the Maryland General Assembly was the colonial institution, an Assembly of Free Marylanders.\nMaryland's foundational charter created a state ruled by the ''[[Palatine lord]],'' Lord Baltimore. As ruler, Lord Baltimore owned directly all of the land granted in the charter, and possessed absolute authority over his domain.\n\nHowever, as elsewhere in English North America, English political institutions were re-created in the colonies, and the Maryland General Assembly fulfilled much the same function as the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]].<ref name=\"Andrews, p.70\">Andrews, p.70</ref> An act was passed providing that:\n\n<blockquote>from henceforth and for ever everyone being of the council of the Province and any other gentleman of able judgement summoned by writ (and the Lord of every Manor within this Province after Manors be erected) shall and may have his voice, seat, and place in every General Assembly ... together with two or more able and sufficient men for the hundred as the said freedmen or the major part of them ... shall think good.</blockquote>\n\nIn addition, the Lord Proprietor could summon any delegates whom he desired.<ref>Andrews, p.71</ref>\n\nIn some ways the General Assembly was an improvement upon the institutions of the mother country. In 1639, noting that Parliament had not been summoned in England for a decade, the free men of Maryland passed an act to the effect that \"assemblies were to be called once in every three years at the least\", ensuring that their voices would be regularly heard.<ref name=\"Andrews, p.70\"/>\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]] the colonial Assembly ceased to exist, and was replaced by its modern successor.\n\nStarting in 1867, the Assembly became increasingly unrepresentative. As the population of [[Baltimore]] increased, it and other urban areas were [[Reynolds v. Sims|not granted additional seats.]] By 1918, the city's population had increased 175% while the entire state gained only 46% with no reallocation of political power.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Okrent |first1=Daniel |title=Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition  |date=11 May 2010 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=978-0743277020  |at=loc 2017 (Kindle) |asin=B003JTHVHY |author-link=Daniel Okrent }}</ref>\n\nDue to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], the General Assembly adjourned early on March 18, 2020 for the first time since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>Collins, David.

Retrieved on 11 April 2020.</ref>\n\n==Qualifications and membership==\nEach senator or delegate must be a U.S. citizen and a resident of Maryland for at least one year preceding his or her election. A prospective legislator must have resided in the legislative district the candidate seeks to represent for the six months prior to election. A senator must be at least twenty-five years of age at the time of election and a delegate at least twenty-one. Military officers other than members of the reserves are not eligible for election to the General Assembly.\n\nEach term lasts four years. However, members of the General Assembly are not [[term limit|term-limited]]. If a vacancy occurs in either house through death, resignation, or disqualification, the [[Governor of Maryland]] appoints a replacement whose name is submitted by the State Central Committee of the same political party as the legislator whose seat is to be filled.\n\n==Legislative districts==\n[[File:Party Composition of Maryland House of Delegates Districts01.png|thumb|Party Composition of Maryland House of Delegates Districts|left|300px|thumb|Map of Maryland House of Delegates electoral districts by party composition:\n{|\n|-\n!3 sub-districts !! 2 sub-districts !! 1 sub-district\n|-\n|{{legend2|#000099|3 dem.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#00CCFF|2 dem., 1 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FF00FF|1 dem., 2 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#990000|3 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |{{legend2|#0000FF|2 dem.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#9BFF9B|1 dem., 1 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FF0000|2 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |{{legend2|#99CCFF|1 dem.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FF99CC|1 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FFFFFF|1 ind.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|}\n]]\n[[File:Party Composition of Maryland State Senate Districts.png|left|thumb|310x310px|Districts and party composition of the Maryland Senate]]\nThe current pattern for distribution of seats began with the legislative apportionment plan of 1972 and has been revised every ten years thereafter according to the results of the decennial [[U.S. Census]]. A Constitutional amendment, the plan created 47 legislative districts, many of which cross county boundaries to delineate districts relatively equal in population. Each legislative district elects one senator and three delegates. In most districts, the three delegates are elected at large from the whole district via [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]]. However, in some more sparsely populated areas of the state, the districts are divided into subdistricts for the election of delegates: either into three one-delegate subdistricts or one two-delegate subdistrict and one one-delegate subdistrict.\n<br />\n\n==Leadership==\nThe Senate is led by a [[President of the Maryland Senate|President]] and the House by a [[Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates|Speaker]] whose respective duties and prerogatives enable them to influence the legislative process significantly. The President and the Speaker appoint the members of most committees and name their chairs and vice-chairs, except in the case of the Joint Committee on Investigation whose members elect their own officers. The President and Speaker preside over the daily sessions of their respective chambers, maintaining decorum and deciding points of order. As legislation is introduced, they assign it to a standing committee for consideration and a public hearing. The president pro tempore appoints majority and minority whips and leaders.\n\n== Overview of legislative procedure ==\nA [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] is a proposal to change, repeal, or add to existing state law. A House Bill (HB) is one introduced in the House of Delegates (for example: HB 6);<ref>{{cite web|title=House Bill 6 (2008)|publisher=Maryland Department of Legislative Services|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?tab=subject3&ys=2008rs/billfile/hb0006.htm|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}</ref> a [[Senate Bill]] (SB), in the Senate.\n\nBills are designated by number, in the order of introduction in each house. For example, HB 16 refers to the sixteenth bill introduced in the House of Delegates. The numbering starts afresh each session. The names of the sponsor (and co-sponsors, if any), the legislator who introduced the bill, becomes part of the title. Bills listed as \"The Speaker (By Request of Administration)\", \"The President (By Request of Administration)\", \"Minority Leader (By Request of Administration)\", or \"Committee Chair (By Request of Department)\" are bills proposed by the Governor and his agencies and are not proposals of the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate, the Minority Leader, or the respective Committee Chair. They are listed with the official title of a legislator rather than the Governor due to requirements in the [[Maryland Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov|title=The Maryland General Assembly|publisher=Maryland Department of Legislative Services, Office of Information Systems|accessdate=May 11, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe [[legislative procedure]], is divided into distinct stages:\n*[[wikt:draft|Drafting]]. The procedure begins when a Senator or Delegate decides to author a bill. A legislator sends the idea for the bill to the Department of Legislative Services' bill drafting division, where it is drafted into bill form. The draft of the bill is returned to the legislator for introduction.\n*Introduction or [[First reading|First Reading]]. A bill is introduced or read the first time when the bill number, the name of the sponsor, and the descriptive title of the bill are read on the floor of the house.\n*[[Committee hearing]]. After introduction, a bill is assigned to the appropriate [[policy committee]], appropriate to the subject matter, for its first hearing. Notice of the hearing is published in the Maryland Register to allow for public comment. During the committee hearing the sponsor presents the bill to the committee, and testimony may be heard in support or opposition to the bill from any member of the public. The committee then votes on whether to pass the bill out of committee, or that it be passed as amended. Bills may be amended several times. It takes a majority vote of the committee membership for a bill to be passed and sent to the next committee or to the [[floor of the house|floor]].\n*[[Second reading]]. A bill [[recommended for passage]] by committee is read a second time on the floor of the house. Legislators, not on the committee where the bill received its public hearing, may only offer amendments to the bill at this stage. House bills in the Senate may be amended by Senators on second or third reading and Senate bills in the House may also be amended on second or third reading. After all amendments are considered, the presiding officer orders the bill to be printed for third reading. This printing would include any committee or floor amendments.\n* [[Third reading]]. A [[roll call vote]] is taken. An ordinary bill needs a [[majority vote]] to pass. An emergency bill requires a three-fifths vote, and a bill requiring the [[Maryland Constitution]] to be amended requires a three-fifths vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maryland Legislator's Handbook|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/Pubs/legislegal/2014-LegislativeHandbookSeries-Vol-1.pdf|website=Maryland.gov|publisher=State of Maryland|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>\n* Second house. If the bill receives a [[Maryland Constitution|constitutional]] majority from the first house, the bill repeats the same steps in the other house. If the second house passes the bill without changing it, it is sent to the governor's desk.\n* Resolution of Differences ([[concurrence]] or conference). If a measure is [[Bill (proposed law)|amended]] in the second house and [[Pass (legislature)|passed]], it is returned to the house of origin for consideration of amendments. The house of origin may [[concur]] with the amendments and send the bill to the governor or reject the amendments and submit it to a two-house [[conference committee]]. Appointed by the Senate President and the House Speaker, a conference committee consists of three members of each house. The committee sends a report of its recommendations to each chamber which then can adopt or reject it. If the report is adopted, the bill is voted upon for final passage in each house. If the report is rejected by either house, the bill fails.\n\n[[File:Governor signs HB 83-2008.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Legislators pose as Governor [[Martin O'Malley|O'Malley]] signs a bill into law at a [[signing ceremony]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], Maryland, on May 13, 2008.]]\n\n* Governor's action. All passed bills, except the budget bill and constitutional amendments, must be presented to the Governor within twenty days following adjournment of a session. The Governor may [[veto]] bills within thirty days after presentation. If a passed bill is not vetoed, it becomes law. The budget bill, however, becomes law upon its final passage and cannot be vetoed. Constitutional amendments also cannot be vetoed; they become law only upon their ratification by the voters at the next general election.\n* [[Veto override]]s. A vetoed bill is returned to the house of origin, where a vote may be taken to override the governor's veto; a three-fifths vote of both houses is required to override a veto.\n* Effective date. Each bill that is passed by the Legislature and approved by the Governor is assigned a chapter number by the [[Maryland Secretary of State|Secretary of State]].

It is a [[bicameral]] body: the [[upper house|upper chamber]], the [[Maryland State Senate]], has 47 representatives and the [[lower house|lower chamber]], the [[Maryland House of Delegates]], has 141 representatives.  Members of both houses serve four-year terms. Each house elects its own officers, judges the qualifications and election of its own members, establishes rules for the conduct of its business, and may punish or expel its own members.\n\nThe General Assembly meets each year for 90 days to act on more than 2,300 bills including the state's annual budget, which it must pass before [[adjournment sine die|adjourning ''sine die'']].  The General Assembly's 438th session convened on January 10, 2018.\n\n==History==\nThe forerunner of the Maryland General Assembly was the colonial institution, an Assembly of Free Marylanders.\nMaryland's foundational charter created a state ruled by the ''[[Palatine lord]],'' Lord Baltimore. As ruler, Lord Baltimore owned directly all of the land granted in the charter, and possessed absolute authority over his domain.\n\nHowever, as elsewhere in English North America, English political institutions were re-created in the colonies, and the Maryland General Assembly fulfilled much the same function as the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]].<ref name=\"Andrews, p.70\">Andrews, p.70</ref> An act was passed providing that:\n\n<blockquote>from henceforth and for ever everyone being of the council of the Province and any other gentleman of able judgement summoned by writ (and the Lord of every Manor within this Province after Manors be erected) shall and may have his voice, seat, and place in every General Assembly ... together with two or more able and sufficient men for the hundred as the said freedmen or the major part of them ... shall think good.</blockquote>\n\nIn addition, the Lord Proprietor could summon any delegates whom he desired.<ref>Andrews, p.71</ref>\n\nIn some ways the General Assembly was an improvement upon the institutions of the mother country. In 1639, noting that Parliament had not been summoned in England for a decade, the free men of Maryland passed an act to the effect that \"assemblies were to be called once in every three years at the least\", ensuring that their voices would be regularly heard.<ref name=\"Andrews, p.70\"/>\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]] the colonial Assembly ceased to exist, and was replaced by its modern successor.\n\nStarting in 1867, the Assembly became increasingly unrepresentative. As the population of [[Baltimore]] increased, it and other urban areas were [[Reynolds v. Sims|not granted additional seats.]] By 1918, the city's population had increased 175% while the entire state gained only 46% with no reallocation of political power.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Okrent |first1=Daniel |title=Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition  |date=11 May 2010 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=978-0743277020  |at=loc 2017 (Kindle) |asin=B003JTHVHY |author-link=Daniel Okrent }}</ref>\n\nDue to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], the General Assembly adjourned early on March 18, 2020 for the first time since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>Collins, David. [https://www.wbaltv.com/article/coronavirus-prompts-maryland-general-assembly-to-adjourn/31751521# \"Maryland General Assembly adjourns early due to coronavirus\"], \"[[WBAL]], Baltimore, 18, March 2020. Retrieved on 11 April 2020.</ref>\n\n==Qualifications and membership==\nEach senator or delegate must be a U.S. citizen and a resident of Maryland for at least one year preceding his or her election. A prospective legislator must have resided in the legislative district the candidate seeks to represent for the six months prior to election. A senator must be at least twenty-five years of age at the time of election and a delegate at least twenty-one. Military officers other than members of the reserves are not eligible for election to the General Assembly.\n\nEach term lasts four years. However, members of the General Assembly are not [[term limit|term-limited]]. If a vacancy occurs in either house through death, resignation, or disqualification, the [[Governor of Maryland]] appoints a replacement whose name is submitted by the State Central Committee of the same political party as the legislator whose seat is to be filled.\n\n==Legislative districts==\n[[File:Party Composition of Maryland House of Delegates Districts01.png|thumb|Party Composition of Maryland House of Delegates Districts|left|300px|thumb|Map of Maryland House of Delegates electoral districts by party composition:\n{|\n|-\n!3 sub-districts !! 2 sub-districts !! 1 sub-district\n|-\n|{{legend2|#000099|3 dem.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#00CCFF|2 dem., 1 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FF00FF|1 dem., 2 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#990000|3 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |{{legend2|#0000FF|2 dem.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#9BFF9B|1 dem., 1 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FF0000|2 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |{{legend2|#99CCFF|1 dem.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FF99CC|1 rep.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br>\n{{legend2|#FFFFFF|1 ind.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|}\n]]\n[[File:Party Composition of Maryland State Senate Districts.png|left|thumb|310x310px|Districts and party composition of the Maryland Senate]]\nThe current pattern for distribution of seats began with the legislative apportionment plan of 1972 and has been revised every ten years thereafter according to the results of the decennial [[U.S. Census]]. A Constitutional amendment, the plan created 47 legislative districts, many of which cross county boundaries to delineate districts relatively equal in population. Each legislative district elects one senator and three delegates. In most districts, the three delegates are elected at large from the whole district via [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]]. However, in some more sparsely populated areas of the state, the districts are divided into subdistricts for the election of delegates: either into three one-delegate subdistricts or one two-delegate subdistrict and one one-delegate subdistrict.\n<br />\n\n==Leadership==\nThe Senate is led by a [[President of the Maryland Senate|President]] and the House by a [[Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates|Speaker]] whose respective duties and prerogatives enable them to influence the legislative process significantly. The President and the Speaker appoint the members of most committees and name their chairs and vice-chairs, except in the case of the Joint Committee on Investigation whose members elect their own officers. The President and Speaker preside over the daily sessions of their respective chambers, maintaining decorum and deciding points of order. As legislation is introduced, they assign it to a standing committee for consideration and a public hearing. The president pro tempore appoints majority and minority whips and leaders.\n\n== Overview of legislative procedure ==\nA [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] is a proposal to change, repeal, or add to existing state law. A House Bill (HB) is one introduced in the House of Delegates (for example: HB 6);<ref>{{cite web|title=House Bill 6 (2008)|publisher=Maryland Department of Legislative Services|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?tab=subject3&ys=2008rs/billfile/hb0006.htm|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}</ref> a [[Senate Bill]] (SB), in the Senate.\n\nBills are designated by number, in the order of introduction in each house. For example, HB 16 refers to the sixteenth bill introduced in the House of Delegates. The numbering starts afresh each session. The names of the sponsor (and co-sponsors, if any), the legislator who introduced the bill, becomes part of the title. Bills listed as \"The Speaker (By Request of Administration)\", \"The President (By Request of Administration)\", \"Minority Leader (By Request of Administration)\", or \"Committee Chair (By Request of Department)\" are bills proposed by the Governor and his agencies and are not proposals of the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate, the Minority Leader, or the respective Committee Chair. They are listed with the official title of a legislator rather than the Governor due to requirements in the [[Maryland Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov|title=The Maryland General Assembly|publisher=Maryland Department of Legislative Services, Office of Information Systems|accessdate=May 11, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe [[legislative procedure]], is divided into distinct stages:\n*[[wikt:draft|Drafting]]. The procedure begins when a Senator or Delegate decides to author a bill. A legislator sends the idea for the bill to the Department of Legislative Services' bill drafting division, where it is drafted into bill form. The draft of the bill is returned to the legislator for introduction.\n*Introduction or [[First reading|First Reading]]. A bill is introduced or read the first time when the bill number, the name of the sponsor, and the descriptive title of the bill are read on the floor of the house.\n*[[Committee hearing]]. After introduction, a bill is assigned to the appropriate [[policy committee]], appropriate to the subject matter, for its first hearing. Notice of the hearing is published in the Maryland Register to allow for public comment. During the committee hearing the sponsor presents the bill to the committee, and testimony may be heard in support or opposition to the bill from any member of the public. The committee then votes on whether to pass the bill out of committee, or that it be passed as amended. Bills may be amended several times. It takes a majority vote of the committee membership for a bill to be passed and sent to the next committee or to the [[floor of the house|floor]].\n*[[Second reading]]. A bill [[recommended for passage]] by committee is read a second time on the floor of the house. Legislators, not on the committee where the bill received its public hearing, may only offer amendments to the bill at this stage. House bills in the Senate may be amended by Senators on second or third reading and Senate bills in the House may also be amended on second or third reading. After all amendments are considered, the presiding officer orders the bill to be printed for third reading. This printing would include any committee or floor amendments.\n* [[Third reading]]. A [[roll call vote]] is taken. An ordinary bill needs a [[majority vote]] to pass. An emergency bill requires a three-fifths vote, and a bill requiring the [[Maryland Constitution]] to be amended requires a three-fifths vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maryland Legislator's Handbook|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/Pubs/legislegal/2014-LegislativeHandbookSeries-Vol-1.pdf|website=Maryland.gov|publisher=State of Maryland|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>\n* Second house. If the bill receives a [[Maryland Constitution|constitutional]] majority from the first house, the bill repeats the same steps in the other house. If the second house passes the bill without changing it, it is sent to the governor's desk.\n* Resolution of Differences ([[concurrence]] or conference). If a measure is [[Bill (proposed law)|amended]] in the second house and [[Pass (legislature)|passed]], it is returned to the house of origin for consideration of amendments. The house of origin may [[concur]] with the amendments and send the bill to the governor or reject the amendments and submit it to a two-house [[conference committee]]. Appointed by the Senate President and the House Speaker, a conference committee consists of three members of each house. The committee sends a report of its recommendations to each chamber which then can adopt or reject it. If the report is adopted, the bill is voted upon for final passage in each house. If the report is rejected by either house, the bill fails.\n\n[[File:Governor signs HB 83-2008.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Legislators pose as Governor [[Martin O'Malley|O'Malley]] signs a bill into law at a [[signing ceremony]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], Maryland, on May 13, 2008.]]\n\n* Governor's action. All passed bills, except the budget bill and constitutional amendments, must be presented to the Governor within twenty days following adjournment of a session. The Governor may [[veto]] bills within thirty days after presentation. If a passed bill is not vetoed, it becomes law. The budget bill, however, becomes law upon its final passage and cannot be vetoed. Constitutional amendments also cannot be vetoed; they become law only upon their ratification by the voters at the next general election.\n* [[Veto override]]s. A vetoed bill is returned to the house of origin, where a vote may be taken to override the governor's veto; a three-fifths vote of both houses is required to override a veto.\n* Effective date. Each bill that is passed by the Legislature and approved by the Governor is assigned a chapter number by the [[Maryland Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. These chaptered bills are [[statute]]s, and ordinarily become part of Maryland law. Ordinarily a law passed during a regular [[Session (parliamentary procedure)|session]] takes effect October 1 of the same year. Emergency bills [[go into effect]] as soon as the governor signs them; these include acts calling for special elections and emergency measures necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dls.state.md.us/data/libandinfser/libandinfser_docandpub/Legislative-Process.pdf|title=The Legislative Process: How A Bill Becomes Law|date=2012|publisher=Maryland State Archives|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Maryland General Assemblies}}\n* [[Annotated Code of Maryland]]: codification of the statutory laws of Maryland\n* [[List of members of the Maryland State Senate]]\n* [[List of members of the Maryland House of Delegates]]\n* [[Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland#Current membership|Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland]]\n\n==References==\n*Andrews, Matthew Page, ''History of Maryland'', Doubleday, New York (1929)\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/ }}\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/mdstateleg/main.htm Washington Post: Metro Report: Maryland Legislature]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070127050747/http://www.md.billhop.com/ Billhop \u2013 Maryland Legislative Wiki]\n*[http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/mdmanual/07leg/html/ga.html Info on General Assembly from Maryland Manual Online]\n*[http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/mdmanual/43const/html/03art3.html Article III of the Maryland Constitution (Legislative Department)]\n*[http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/html/legislative.html ''The Archives of Maryland'' extensive site on Maryland's various Legislative bodies.

The Italian chronicler Gabriele de\u2019 Mussi, in his ''Istoria de Morbo sive Mortalitate quae fuit Anno Domini 1348'', describes quite plausibly how the plague was transmitted by the Mongols by throwing diseased cadavers with catapults into the besieged city, and how ships transporting Genovese soldiers, fleas and rats fleeing from there brought it to the Mediterranean ports. Given the highly complex epidemiology of plague, this interpretation of the Black Death (which might have killed >25 million people in the following years throughout Europe) as stemming from a specific and localized origin of the Black Death remains controversial.

The second model claims to better fits the trends of death toll because the rat-flea-human hypothesis would have produced a delayed but very high spike in deaths, which contradict historical death data.<ref>{{cite news|author=Ben Guarino |date=2018-01-16|work=[[Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/01/16/the-classic-explanation-for-the-black-death-plague-is-wrong-scientists-say/|title=The classic explanation for the Black Death plague is wrong, scientists say|archive-url=http://archive.today/ru0O9|archive-date=2018-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rats May Not Be to Blame for Spreading the 'Black Death'|author=Rachel Rettner|publisher=[[Live Science]]|date=2018-01-17|url=https://www.livescience.com/61444-black-death-cause-found-transmission.html|}}</ref>\n\nWall\u00f8e complains that all of these authors \"take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat \u2192 rat flea \u2192 human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of ''Yersinia pestis'' infection could spread\", whilst pointing to several other possibilities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval and Modern Bubonic Plague: some clinical continuities|first =Lars|last=Walloe|page=69|series=Pestilential Complexities: Understanding Medieval Plague|editor=Vivian Nutton|publisher=Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL|year=2008|ref=harv}}\n</ref> Similarly, Green has argued that greater attention is needed to the range of (especially non-[[commensalism|commensal]]) animals that might be involved in the transmission of plague.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Monica|author-link=Monica Green (historian)|date=2014|title=Taking \"Pandemic\" Seriously: Making the Black Death Global|url=http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=2&article=1000&context=medieval_globe&type=additional|journal=The Medieval Globe|pages=31ff|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408203736/http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=2&article=1000&context=medieval_globe&type=additional|archive-date=8 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nArchaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of numerous rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that ''Y. pestis'' was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person.<ref>{{Cite news |author=M.

The former urban area was extended for four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade. [[Sun Yat-sen]] (1866\u20131925), leader of the [[Chinese Revolution (1911)|Chinese Revolution]] of 1911 and subsequent first president of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], visited the Tsingtau area and stated in 1912, \"I am impressed. The city is a true model for China's future\".<ref>Schultz-Naumann, p. 184</ref>\n\n====1914\u20131922====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the first Japan-occupation period (1914\u20131922). In 1914, Tsingtao was taken over by Japanese and served as a base for the exploitation of natural resources of Shandong and northern China. With the development of industry and commerce, a \"New City District\" was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones (Li 2007, p.&nbsp;133). In the meantime, a number of schools, hospitals and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the eastern bay area.\n\n====1922\u20131938====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922\u20131938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for the purpose of entertainment and sports were completed. By the year of 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p.&nbsp;327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat.\n\n====1938\u20131945====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938\u20131945). Japan staged a comeback to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the City Planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to realise them respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences and a small number of roads and streets(Lu 2001, p.&nbsp;339).\n\n===Post\u2013World War II===\nAfter World War II the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Western Pacific Fleet]] of the [[US Navy]] in 1945, but headquarters was transferred to the [[Philippines]] sometime in late 1948. On 2 June 1949, the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]]-led [[Chinese Red Army|Red Army]] entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] control since that time.\n\nSince the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, western Qingdao developed quickly as a port city. It is now the headquarters of the Chinese navy's northern fleet. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call in more than 37 years to China. {{USS|Rentz|FFG-46|6}}, {{USS|Reeves|DLG-24|6}}, and {{USS|Oldendorf|DD-972|6}} and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] (PLAN).\n\nNorthern Qingdao, particularly [[Shibei District|Shibei]], [[Licang District|Licang]], and [[Chengyang District|Chengyang]] districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city's southern district; this, as well as local wind patterns, allows Qingdao to enjoy clean, clear air year round.\n[[File:Tsingdao scene.jpg|thumb|Image of Qingdao in the early 1900s]]\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThe sub-provincial city of Qingdao has 7 [[District (PRC)|districts]] (\u533a ''qu'') and 3 [[county-level city|county-level cities]] (\u5e02 ''shi''):\n\n{{Administrative divisions of Qingdao}}\n\nGeographically, there are four districts (Shinan, Shibei, Licang and Laoshan) constituting a peninsula on the east coast of the [[Jiaozhou Bay]] as the core urban area, one (Chengyang) on the north coast and one (Xihai'an) on the west coast of the [[Yellow Sea]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Txu-oclc-10552568-nj51-13.jpg|left|thumb|Qingdao (labelled as CH'ING-TAO (TSINGTAO) {{lang|zh-hant|\u9752\u5cf6}}) (1954)]]\n{{climate chart\n| Qingdao\n| \u22122.9 |  3.1 |  11.2\n| \u22121.2 |  5.3 |  13.5\n|  2.8 |  9.4 |  22.4\n|  8.3 | 15.3 |  28.5\n| 13.7 | 20.7 |  61.9\n| 18.2 | 24.0 |  74.3\n| 22.4 | 27.3 | 148.6\n| 23.1 | 28.4 | 150.2\n| 19.3 | 25.5 |  72.4\n| 13.5 | 20.1 |  39.7\n|  6.2 | 12.6 |  29.3\n| \u22120.2 |  5.8 |  12.1\n|float = right\n|clear = none\n|source = CMA<ref name = \"cma graphical\"/> }}\n\nQingdao is located on the south facing coast of the [[Shandong Peninsula]] ({{lang-de|Schantung Halbinsel}}).

Another estimated 5 million live in other cities under Qingdao's jurisdiction. The annual birth rate is calculated around 76,507, with a [[birth rate]] of 10.15 per year per thousand, and a [[death rate]] of 6.32, both calculated on an annual basis. Living standards are among the highest of leading Chinese cities due to the strong export economy and relatively high family wages.\n\nQingdao is home to 38 [[Chinese nationalities|Chinese ethnic minorities]], which account for 0.14% of the city's total population.\n\nThere is a large Korean community in Qingdao. By 2009, there were approximately 100,000 Koreans working, studying and living in Qingdao, which makes Qingdao the second in terms of Korean population in China, following Beijing which has about 200,000 Koreans.<ref>\n{{cite news\n  |url= http://www.chinanews.com.cn/sh/news/2009/10-08/1899449.shtml\n  |script-title= zh:\u97e9\u56fd\u65c5\u5ba2\u4f4d\u5c45\u5317\u4eac\u5165\u5883\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\u4e4b\u9996\n  |date= 2009-10-08\n  |accessdate= 2009-12-01\n  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091126170335/http://www.chinanews.com.cn/sh/news/2009/10-08/1899449.shtml\n  |archive-date= 26 November 2009\n  |url-status= live\n  |df= dmy-all\n  }}\n</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Tsingtao beer a 2015-04-07 16-56-17.JPG|left|thumb|170px|Qingdao-based [[Tsingtao beer]], China's second-largest domestic brand and its largest export brand.]]\n[[File:Views of Qingdao tower.jpg|thumb|upright|Qingdao TV Tower]]\nAn important region in Eastern China, Shandong Province has seen substantial change in its economic landscape in recent years.

The former urban area was extended for four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade. [[Sun Yat-sen]] (1866\u20131925), leader of the [[Chinese Revolution (1911)|Chinese Revolution]] of 1911 and subsequent first president of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], visited the Tsingtau area and stated in 1912, \"I am impressed. The city is a true model for China's future\".<ref>Schultz-Naumann, p. 184</ref>\n\n====1914\u20131922====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the first Japan-occupation period (1914\u20131922). In 1914, Tsingtao was taken over by Japanese and served as a base for the exploitation of natural resources of Shandong and northern China. With the development of industry and commerce, a \"New City District\" was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones (Li 2007, p.&nbsp;133). In the meantime, a number of schools, hospitals and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the eastern bay area.\n\n====1922\u20131938====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922\u20131938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for the purpose of entertainment and sports were completed. By the year of 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p.&nbsp;327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat.\n\n====1938\u20131945====\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938\u20131945). Japan staged a comeback to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the City Planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to realise them respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences and a small number of roads and streets(Lu 2001, p.&nbsp;339).\n\n===Post\u2013World War II===\nAfter World War II the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Western Pacific Fleet]] of the [[US Navy]] in 1945, but headquarters was transferred to the [[Philippines]] sometime in late 1948. On 2 June 1949, the [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]]-led [[Chinese Red Army|Red Army]] entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] control since that time.\n\nSince the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, western Qingdao developed quickly as a port city. It is now the headquarters of the Chinese navy's northern fleet. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call in more than 37 years to China. {{USS|Rentz|FFG-46|6}}, {{USS|Reeves|DLG-24|6}}, and {{USS|Oldendorf|DD-972|6}} and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] (PLAN).\n\nNorthern Qingdao, particularly [[Shibei District|Shibei]], [[Licang District|Licang]], and [[Chengyang District|Chengyang]] districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city's southern district; this, as well as local wind patterns, allows Qingdao to enjoy clean, clear air year round.\n[[File:Tsingdao scene.jpg|thumb|Image of Qingdao in the early 1900s]]\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThe sub-provincial city of Qingdao has 7 [[District (PRC)|districts]] (\u533a ''qu'') and 3 [[county-level city|county-level cities]] (\u5e02 ''shi''):\n\n{{Administrative divisions of Qingdao}}\n\nGeographically, there are four districts (Shinan, Shibei, Licang and Laoshan) constituting a peninsula on the east coast of the [[Jiaozhou Bay]] as the core urban area, one (Chengyang) on the north coast and one (Xihai'an) on the west coast of the [[Yellow Sea]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Txu-oclc-10552568-nj51-13.jpg|left|thumb|Qingdao (labelled as CH'ING-TAO (TSINGTAO) {{lang|zh-hant|\u9752\u5cf6}}) (1954)]]\n{{climate chart\n| Qingdao\n| \u22122.9 |  3.1 |  11.2\n| \u22121.2 |  5.3 |  13.5\n|  2.8 |  9.4 |  22.4\n|  8.3 | 15.3 |  28.5\n| 13.7 | 20.7 |  61.9\n| 18.2 | 24.0 |  74.3\n| 22.4 | 27.3 | 148.6\n| 23.1 | 28.4 | 150.2\n| 19.3 | 25.5 |  72.4\n| 13.5 | 20.1 |  39.7\n|  6.2 | 12.6 |  29.3\n| \u22120.2 |  5.8 |  12.1\n|float = right\n|clear = none\n|source = CMA<ref name = \"cma graphical\"/> }}\n\nQingdao is located on the south facing coast of the [[Shandong Peninsula]] ({{lang-de|Schantung Halbinsel}}).

{"title_page": "Election ink", "text_new": "[[File:Iraq-election2005-V.jpg|thumb|Anonymous voter shows stained finger during the Iraqi election of 2005.]]\n  \n{{voting}}\n\n'''Electoral ink''', '''indelible''' '''ink''', '''electoral stain''' or '''phosphoric ink''' is a semi-permanent [[ink]] or [[dye]] that is applied to the [[forefinger]] (usually) of [[voters]] during [[elections]] in order to prevent [[electoral fraud]] such as double voting. It is an effective method for countries where identification documents for citizens are not always standardised or institutionalised. Election ink uses [[silver nitrate]], and excessive exposure can cause [[argyria]]. It was first used during the [[1962 Indian general election]], in [[Mysore State]], now the modern-day state of [[Karnataka]].\n\n==Application==\nElectoral stain is used as an effective security feature to prevent double voting in elections. Ink is normally applied to the left hand index finger, especially to the [[cuticle]] where it is almost impossible to remove quickly. Ink may be applied in a variety of ways, depending on circumstance and preference. The most common methods are via dipping bottles with sponge inserts, bottles with a brush applicators, spray bottles, and [[marker pens]]. With all methods the finger should be left to dry for 15\u201330 seconds and exposed to light before being cleaned to ensure the mark remains visible for the desired length of time.\n\n==Composition==\nElectoral stain typically contains a pigment for instant recognition, a [[silver nitrate]] which stains the skin on exposure to ultraviolet light, leaving a mark that is impossible to wash off and is only removed as external skin cells are replaced. Industry standard electoral inks contain 10%, 14% or 18% silver nitrate solution, depending on the length of time the mark is required to be visible. Although normally water-based, electoral stains occasionally contain a solvent such as alcohol to allow for faster drying, especially when used with dipping bottles, which may also contain a biocide to ensure bacteria are not transferred from voter to voter. Silver chloride can be easily removed by hydroxides, hence other photosensitive pigmentation needs to be added.\n\n==Longevity==\nElection stain typically stays on [[Human skin|skin]] for 72\u201396 hours, lasting 2 to 4 weeks on the [[fingernail]] and [[cuticle]] area. The election ink used puts a permanent mark on the cuticle area which disappears only with the growth of new nail. It can take up to 4 months for the stain to be replaced completely by new nail growth. Stain with concentrations of [[silver nitrate]] higher than 18% have been found to have no effect on stain longevity, as even with stronger solutions [[silver nitrate]] doesn't have a [[photosensitive reaction]] on live skin cells. This means that the stain will wear off as new skin grows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ptcl.chem.ox.ac.uk/~hmc/hsci/chemicals/silver_nitrate.html |title='&#39;Chemical Safety Database'&#39; |publisher=Ptcl.chem.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref> Silver nitrate is an irritant and frequently harmful at 25% solution and above, even being used as an effective, if painful, cauterizing agent in the treatment of [[rhinitis]] at that concentration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pakmedinet.com/10886 |title='&#39;PakMediNet'&#39; |publisher=Pakmedinet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref> At 25% the silver nitrate content will also start to precipitate depending on conditions, forming fine crystals which can also be irritating on skin and reducing the active dissolved [[silver nitrate]] back to as low as 18%.\n\n==Colour==\nElectoral stain is traditionally violet in colour, before the photosensitive element takes effect to leave a black or brown mark. However, for the [[2005 Surinamese legislative election]], orange replaced violet as the colour for marking the voters' fingers as it was found to last just as long and be more appealing to voters, as it resembled the [[national colours]].\n\n==Efficiency==\nMarker pens are the most efficient use of ink, with one 5\u00a0ml pen able to mark 600 people, although dipping bottles are often preferred, despite a 100 ml bottle only marking 1000. This may be due to the iconic images associated with the Iraqi and Afghan elections of the early 21st century. Dipping bottles can leave a more comprehensive stain of slightly longer longevity (depending on silver nitrate content) than markers can. However marker pens are much cheaper and easier to transport, reducing costs to the election organisers considerably, and the advised option when stains are only needed to be guaranteed for 3 to 5 days. Marker pens also leave a much smaller mark when properly applied, which is more agreeable to many voters.\n\n==Controversies==\nIn the [[2004 Afghan presidential election]], allegations of electoral fraud arose around the use of indelible ink stains, which many claimed were easily washed off.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Baldauf |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1012/p06s01-wosc.html |title='&#39;An Afghan 'Hanging chad' Dispute'&#39; |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref> Election officials had chosen to use the more efficient marker pen option; however, regular marker pens were also sent out to polling stations, which led to confusion and some people being marked with less permanent ink.<ref>{{cite web|last=Raman |first=Sunil |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3736590.stm |title='&#39;India link to Afghan ink stink'&#39; |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-10-12 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2008 Malaysian general election]], the election authorities canceled the use of Electoral Stain a week before voters went to the polls,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.my.msn.com/regional/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1274414 |title='&#39;MSN News article'&#39; |publisher=News.my.msn.com |accessdate=2014-04-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513080647/http://news.my.msn.com/regional/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1274414 |archivedate=2008-05-13 }}</ref> saying it would be unconstitutional to prevent people from voting even if they had already had their fingers stained.

This means that the stain will wear off as new skin grows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ptcl.chem.ox.ac.uk/~hmc/hsci/chemicals/silver_nitrate.html |title='&#39;Chemical Safety Database'&#39; |publisher=Ptcl.chem.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref> Silver nitrate is an irritant and frequently harmful at 25% solution and above, even being used as an effective, if painful, cauterizing agent in the treatment of [[rhinitis]] at that concentration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pakmedinet.com/10886 |title='&#39;PakMediNet'&#39; |publisher=Pakmedinet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref> At 25% the silver nitrate content will also start to precipitate depending on conditions, forming fine crystals which can also be irritating on skin and reducing the active dissolved [[silver nitrate]] back to as low as 18%.\n\n==Colour==\nElectoral stain is traditionally violet in colour, before the photosensitive element takes effect to leave a black or brown mark. However, for the [[2005 Surinamese legislative election]], orange replaced violet as the colour for marking the voters' fingers as it was found to last just as long and be more appealing to voters, as it resembled the [[national colours]].\n\n==Efficiency==\nMarker pens are the most efficient use of ink, with one 5ml pen able to mark 600 people, although dipping bottles are often preferred, despite a 100 ml bottle only marking 1000. This may be due to the iconic images associated with the Iraqi and Afghan elections of the early 21st century. Dipping bottles can leave a more comprehensive stain of slightly longer longevity (depending on silver nitrate content) than markers can. However marker pens are much cheaper and easier to transport, reducing costs to the election organisers considerably, and the advised option when stains are only needed to be guaranteed for 3 to 5 days. Marker pens also leave a much smaller mark when properly applied, which is more agreeable to many voters.\n\n==Controversies==\nIn the [[2004 Afghan presidential election]], allegations of electoral fraud arose around the use of indelible ink stains, which many claimed were easily washed off.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Baldauf |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1012/p06s01-wosc.html |title='&#39;An Afghan 'Hanging chad' Dispute'&#39; |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref> Election officials had chosen to use the more efficient marker pen option; however, regular marker pens were also sent out to polling stations, which led to confusion and some people being marked with less permanent ink.<ref>{{cite web|last=Raman |first=Sunil |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3736590.stm |title='&#39;India link to Afghan ink stink'&#39; |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-10-12 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2008 Malaysian general election]], the election authorities canceled the use of Electoral Stain a week before voters went to the polls,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.my.msn.com/regional/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1274414 |title='&#39;MSN News article'&#39; |publisher=News.my.msn.com |accessdate=2014-04-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513080647/http://news.my.msn.com/regional/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1274414 |archivedate=2008-05-13 }}</ref> saying it would be unconstitutional to prevent people from voting even if they had already had their fingers stained.
