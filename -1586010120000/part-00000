{"title_page": "64 BC Syria earthquake", "text_new": "The '''64 BC Syria earthquake''' is mentioned in catalogues of historical earthquakes. It affected the region of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and may have caused structural damage in the city of [[Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n==Sources==\nThe earthquake is mentioned in an [[epitome]] of ''Liber Historiarum Philippicarum'', written by the historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] (2nd century).<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> Justin reported that a devastating earthquake affected Syria, dating the earthquake to the end of the reign of [[Tigranes the Great]] (reigned 95\u201355 BC) in Syria. The earthquake reportedly caused widespread destruction, and caused the deaths of 170,000 people.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\nThere are disdagreements over when Tigranes stopped reigning over Syria, and when the earthquake took place. Other suggested dates for the earthquake give the year as 65 BC or 69 BC. While Justin used the historian [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] as his main source, his surviving works indicate that Justin misunderstood this source. Resulting in a confusion over the dates of events, and the identities of the characters mentioned.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\nAnother mention of this earthquake is found in ''Historiarum Adversum Paganos'', written by the historian [[Orosius]] (5th century).<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> The narrative mentions that when the earthquake took place, [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] was attending a festival of the goddess [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] in the [[Bosporus]]. The text is though to describe a visir of Mithridates to the Cimmerian Bosporus (modern [[Kerch Strait]]), located at the [[Sea of Azov]] and the peninmsula of [[Crimea]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> The text does not clarify whether Mithridates himself experienced the earthquake, or merely heard news about it.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n''Chronographia'' by [[John Malalas]] briefly mentions the eartquake. He reports that it caused the [[Bouleuterion]] of [[Antioch]] to fall down. The destroyed building was eventually rebuilt by [[Pompey]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> Modern sources have extrapolated that Antioch suffered extensive structural damage or that the entire city was destroyed by the earthquake. However, Malalas states nothing about such an event.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n==Possible Jewish sources==\nThe same earthquake is supposed in modern sources to have affected [[Jerusalem]], which is located {{convert|550|km|abbr=on}} south of Antioch. The earthquake supposedly caused structural damage to Jerusalem's city walls, and to the [[Second Temple]]'s compound.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\nThe primary source for such an event is the [[Babylonian Talmud]]. The narrative speaks of a struggle for power between the sons of Queen regnant [[Salome Alexandra]] (reigned 76-67 BC). Her two sons were [[Hyrcanus II]] and [[Aristobulus II]], who were the last kings of the [[Hasmonean dynasty]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\nHyrcanus II allied himself with the [[Nabataeans]], and they helped him in a [[Siege of Jerusalem (64 BC)|siege of Jerusalem]]. According to the Talmud, the two opposing sides reached an agreement to allow the supply of sacrificial animals to the Second Temple, which was needed for the year's celebration of the [[Passover]]. The defenders of the city would lower a \"big basket\" filled with golden coins over the city walls, which the attackers were required to fill. The attackers broke the agreement, and took the gold without fullfilling their end of the bargain. Instead of sending sacrificial animals, they send a pig. The pig struck its claws to the city walls, and suddenly an earthquake struck the [[Land of Israel]]. According to the Talmud, the earthquake shocked areas at a distance of 400 [[parasang]]s by 400 parasangs. The parasang is a Persian unit of distance, about 4000 yards long.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n[[Josephus]] account of the siege mentions neither an earthquake, nor a pig. In his narrative, the Passover services were both prevented and mocked during the siege. [[Divine punishment]] struck in the form of a \"storm of wind\", that destroyed [[Judea]]'s fruits. According to Josephus, prices rose due to the destruction. A modius of wheat cost 11 [[Greek drachma|drachmae]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n[[Cassius Dio]] also mentions the war between the two brothers, without mentioning an earthquake. The Talmud's earthquake may have originated in a story of figurative shock over the \"ungodly breach of agreement\", and the consequent disruption services.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> This idea seems to be corroborated by the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]'s narrative.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n==Historical context==\nIn chronological accounts, the 64 BC siege and the earthquake are place after the death of [[Salome Alexandra]] (d. 67 BC), and before [[Pompey]]'\ns [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|Siege of Jerusalem]] (63 BC).<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> Pompey's siege is nnown to have taken place shortly after the death of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\nPompey and [[Tigranes the Great]] were rivals in war until 66 BC, and then Pompey fought against [[Kingdom of Pontus]]. Pompey's subordinate commander [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]] is credited with ending the Nabatean siege of Jerusalem. Scaurus was send from [[Damascus]] to Judea, where he offered bribes to both sides of the conflict. The siege was lifted, and Scaurus offered his support to [[Aristobulus II]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\nThe Passover associated with the siege and earthquake took place in 65 or 64 BC. In narratives of the earthquake, the Passover took place at the same time as a festival of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]. This would place the earthquake in [[Spring (season)|springtime]], as both these festivities teaditionally took place in spring.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\nThe \"fanciful\" Talmudic narrative reports on an earthquake, but does not support the idea that Jerusalem's city walls and the Second Temple suffered extensive damage. [[Josephus]]' narrative does not mention such a disaster either.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> Both Josephus and [[Strabo]] mention that Jerusalem's city walls were still robust during Pompey's siege, and that Pompey faced difficulties in capturing the city.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n==Modern perspectives==\nA group of 8 sediment deformation horizons (mixed layers) have been identified among the [[Holocene]] sediments found in the [[Tze'elim Stream]] (Nahal Tze'elim) of the [[Dead Sea]] region. The deformations are believed to have a seismic event origin, with each deformation corresponding to a seismic event.

It affected the region of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and may have caused structural damage in the city of [[Jerusalem]]. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n==Sources==\nThe earthquake is mentioned in an [[epitome]] of ''Liber Historiarum Philippicarum'', written by the historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] (2nd century). <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> Justin reported that a devastating earthquake affected Syria, dating the earthquake to the end of the reign of [[Tigranes the Great]] (reigned 95\u201355 BC) in Syria. The earthquake reportedly caused widespread destruction, and caused the deaths of 170,000 people.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> \n\nThere are disdagreements over when Tigranes stopped reigning over Syria, and when the earthquake took place. Other suggested dates for the earthquake give the year as 65 BC or 69 BC. While Justin used the historian [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] as his main source, his surviving works indicate that Justin misunderstood this source. Resulting in a confusion over the dates of events, and the identities of the characters mentioned. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\nAnother mention of this earthquake is found in ''Historiarum Adversum Paganos'', written by the historian [[Orosius]] (5th century). <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> The narrative mentions that when the earthquake took place, [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] was attending a festival of the goddess [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] in the [[Bosporus]]. The text is though to describe a visir of Mithridates to the Cimmerian Bosporus (modern [[Kerch Strait]]), located at the [[Sea of Azov]] and the peninmsula of [[Crimea]]. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> The text does not clarify whether Mithridates himself experienced the earthquake, or merely heard news about it. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n''Chronographia'' by [[John Malalas]] briefly mentions the eartquake. He reports that it caused the [[Bouleuterion]] of [[Antioch]] to fall down. The destroyed building was eventually rebuilt by [[Pompey]]. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> Modern sources have extrapolated that Antioch suffered extensive structural damage or that the entire city was destroyed by the earthquake. However, Malalas states nothing about such an event. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n==Possible Jewish sources==\nThe same earthquake is supposed in modern sources to have affected [[Jerusalem]], which is located {{convert|550|km|abbr=on}} south of Antioch. The earthquake supposedly caused structural damage to Jerusalem's city walls, and to the [[Second Temple]]'s compound. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\nThe primary source for such an event is the [[Babylonian Talmud]]. The narrative speaks of a struggle for power between the sons of Queen regnant [[Salome Alexandra]] (reigned 76-67 BC). Her two sons were [[Hyrcanus II]] and [[Aristobulus II]], who were the last kings of the [[Hasmonean dynasty]]. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\nHyrcanus II allied himself with the [[Nabataeans]], and they helped him in a [[Siege of Jerusalem (64 BC)|siege of Jerusalem]]. According to the Talmud, the two opposing sides reached an agreement to allow the supply of sacrificial animals to the Second Temple, which was needed for the year's celebration of the [[Passover]]. The defenders of the city would lower a \"big basket\" filled with golden coins over the city walls, which the attackers were required to fill. The attackers broke the agreement, and took the gold without fullfilling their end of the bargain. Instead of sending sacrificial animals, they send a pig. The pig struck its claws to the city walls, and suddenly an earthquake struck the [[Land of Israel]]. According to the Talmud, the earthquake shocked areas at a distance of 400 [[parasang]]s by 400 parasangs. The parasang is a Persian unit of distance, about 4000 yards long. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n[[Josephus]] account of the siege mentions neither an earthquake, nor a pig. In his narrative, the Passover services were both prevented and mocked during the siege. [[Divine punishment]] struck in the form of a \"storm of wind\", that destroyed [[Judea]]'s fruits. According to Josephus, prices rose due to the destruction. A modius of wheat cost 11 [[Greek drachma|drachmae]]. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n[[Cassius Dio]] also mentions the war between the two brothers, without mentioning an earthquake. The Talmud's earthquake may have originated in a story of figurative shock over the \"ungodly breach of agreement\", and the consequent disruption services. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> This idea seems to be corroborated by the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]'s narrative. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n==Historical context==\nIn chronological accounts, the 64 BC siege and the earthquake are place after the death of [[Salome Alexandra]] (d. 67 BC), and before [[Pompey]]'\ns [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|Siege of Jerusalem]] (63 BC). <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> Pompey's siege is nnown to have taken place shortly after the death of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\nPompey and [[Tigranes the Great]] were rivals in war until 66 BC, and then Pompey fought against [[Kingdom of Pontus]]. Pompey's subordinate commander [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]] is credited with ending the Nabatean siege of Jerusalem. Scaurus was send from [[Damascus]] to Judea, where he offered bribes to both sides of the conflict. The siege was lifted, and Scaurus offered his support to [[Aristobulus II]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\nThe Passover associated with the siege and earthquake took place in 65 or 64 BC. In narratives of the earthquake, the Passover took place at the same time as a festival of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]. This would place the earthquake in [[Spring (season)|springtime]], as both these festivities teaditionally took place in spring. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\nThe \"fanciful\" Talmudic narrative reports on an earthquake, but does not support the idea that Jerusalem's city walls and the Second Temple suffered extensive damage. [[Josephus]]' narrative does not mention such a disaster either. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> Both Josephus and [[Strabo]] mention that Jerusalem's city walls were still robust during Pompey's siege, and that Pompey faced difficulties in capturing the city. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n==Modern perspectives==\nA group of 8 sediment deformation horizons (mixed layers) have been identified among the [[Holocene]] sediments found in the [[Tze'elim Stream]] (Nahal Tze'elim) of the [[Dead Sea]] region. The deformations are believed to have a seismic event origin, with each deformation corresponding to a seismic event. The earliest sediment deformation in the group has been dated through [[radiometry]] to a range of dates between 200 BC and 40 BC. One theory associates the sentiment with the 64 BC earthquake. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\nIn this view, the epicenter of the earthquake was in the Dead Sea. The earthquake would be strong enough to cause structural damage in both Jerusalem and Antioch. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref> Doubts on this view point to the questionable historicity of the Talmudic sources, and the insufficient data from other primary sources. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 770-773</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite LSA |last=Karcz |first=Iaakov |year=2004 |title=Implications of some early Jewish sources for estimates of earthquake hazard in the Holy Land |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.393.3596&rep=rep1&type=pdf |journal=[[Annals of Geophysics]] |volume=47 |pages=759\u2013792 |accessdate=2020-04-02}}\n\n[[Category:64 BC]]\n[[Category:1st-century BC earthquakes]]\n[[Category:Ancient Antioch]]\n[[Category:Ancient history of Jerusalem]]\n", "name_user": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64_BC_Syria_earthquake"}

First, the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE).  The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death.  This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Patients overload===\nMayor De Blasio made a call for medical staffs.<ref name=20200403com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc.html|title=Opinion: We Need All Medical Workers on the Front Lines|first=Bill|last=de Blasio|date=3 April 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref>{{explain|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Isolation and trauma ===\n{{See also|Mental health during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n====China====\nAs for China, medical staff are self isolating from families and under high emotional pressure.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nPsychological trauma is expected among medical professionals.<ref name=\"nytSick0329\">{{cite news |author=Jennifer Senior |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators-rationing-triage.html |title=Opinion &#124; Doctors Must Ration Ventilators as Coronavirus Rages.

various low-cost alternative ventilation devices or adaptations.\n\nAnaesthetist Dr. Alan Gauthier from [[Ontario]], Canada, turned one single-patient ventilator into a nine-patient device thanks to a 2006 YouTube video by 2 doctors from Detroit.<ref name=\":4\" /> The method uses T-shaped tubes to split airflow and multiply the number of patients provided with respiratory support.\n\nIn Ireland,

devices.<ref name=\":6\" /> The valves supplier was itself out of stock leading to patient deaths.<ref name=\":6\" /> Vallini contacted [[Fab lab|FabLab]] founder Massimo Temporelli, which invited Michele Faini, an expert in 3D print manufacturing and a research and development designer at Lonati SpA to join a 3D printing effort.<ref name=\":6\" /> When the supplier didn't wish to share the design's specifics, they reverse-engineered the valves and produced a limited not-for-profit series for local hospitals.<ref name=\":6\" /> To satisfy biomedical requirements that can withstand periodic sanitation, Lonati SpA used their SLS 3D printers to print about 100 valves in [[Nylon 12|Nylon PA12]].<ref name=\":6\" /> Faini and Temporelli still acknowledge the limitations of their production: 3D printing not being able to reach the quality and sterilised context of the original valves and manufacturing process.<ref name=\":6\" /> Contrary to rumors online, the valves don't cost {{usd|10,000}} each and the original manufacturer did not threaten to sue the 3D printers team.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nHackers of the ''Ventilator Project'' have brainstormed to propose to re-purposing

First, the excess demand due to the pandemic.  Second, the specialised nature of care of the critically ill and the time taken to train for new methods of working to prevent cross-contamination, in some cases with new types of protective equipment (PPE).  The third factor is the loss of staff to the pandemic, mostly because they are self-isolating with symptoms (which may be unrelated) or because a household member has symptoms, but also because of long term effects of the disease, or death.  This last case applies across the health system and makes it harder to draw staff from non-COVID health workers.\n\nMitigations being used include recruiting military and sports medics, final-year doctors in training, private sector staff, and re-recruiting retired staff and those who have moved from the medical sector.\n\nFor non-medical roles staff have been recruited from other sectors.\n\n=== Patients overload===\nMayor De Blasio made a call for medical staffs.<ref name=20200403com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-deblasio-nyc.html|title=Opinion: We Need All Medical Workers on the Front Lines|first=Bill|last=de Blasio|date=3 April 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref>{{explain|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Isolation and trauma ===\n{{See also|Mental health during the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n====China====\nAs for China, medical staff are self isolating from families and under high emotional pressure.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nPsychological trauma is expected among medical professionals.<ref name=\"nytSick0329\">{{cite news |author=Jennifer Senior |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators-rationing-triage.html |title=Opinion &#124; Doctors Must Ration Ventilators as Coronavirus Rages.

One-act plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a set of short pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both.\n\nThe play portrays the chance meeting, subsequent love affair, and eventual parting of a married woman and a physician. The sadness of their serious and secretive affair is contrasted throughout the play with the boisterous, uncomplicated relationship of a second couple. ''Still Life'' differs from most of the plays in the cycle by having an unhappy ending.\n\nThe play was first produced in London in May 1936 and was staged in New York in October of that year.

It charts the love affair between Laura Jesson, a housewife, and Alec Harvey, a married physician. The location is the refreshment room of \"Milford Junction\" railway station.\n\nIn the first scene, Myrtle, who runs the station buffet, rebuffs the attempts of Albert, the ticket-inspector, to flirt with her. Laura is waiting for her train home after shopping. She is in pain from a piece of grit that has been blown into her eye. Alec introduces himself as a doctor and quickly removes it for her. She thanks him and goes to catch her train.\n\nThree months later, Alec and Laura are once more in the refreshment room. It becomes clear that after their first meeting they encountered each other a second time by chance and have enjoyed each other's company to the extent of arranging to lunch together and go to the cinema. There have been several such meetings. Laura is beginning to wonder about the propriety of meeting him so often, but Alec reminds her that he too is married, with children and other responsibilities.\n\nIn the third scene, set in October, Albert and Myrtle continue their slightly combative flirtation. Alec and Laura come in, and over coffee they admit that they are in love with each other. They are both determined not to upset their happy marriages, but will meet secretly. They make arrangements to meet at the flat of a friend of Alec.\n\nBy December, they are both agonised by guilt and agree that their affair must stop. Alec tells Laura that he has been offered an attractive medical post in South Africa, and will accept it unless she asks him not to.\n\nThe fifth and final scene is set in March. Albert seems to be making progress with Myrtle. Alec and Laura enter. He is leaving to take up his new post in South Africa, and she has come to see him off. They are prevented from having the passionate farewell they both yearn for when Dolly, a talkative friend of hers intrudes into their last moments together, and their final goodbye is cruelly limited to a formal handshake. He leaves, and Laura remains, while Dolly talks on. Suddenly, as the sound of the approaching express train is heard, Laura suddenly rushes out to the platform. She returns \"looking very white and shaky\".<ref>Coward, p. 380</ref> Dolly persuades Myrtle to pour some brandy for Laura, who sips it. The sound of their train is heard, and Dolly gathers up her parcels as the curtain falls.\n\n==Reception==\nCoward himself later said of the play, \"''Still Life'' was the most mature play of the whole series.... It is well written, economical and well constructed: the characters, I think, are true, and I can say now, reading it with detachment after so many years, that I am proud to have written it.\"<ref name=nc>Coward, unnumbered introductory page</ref> John Lahr, in his 1982 book on Coward's plays, disagreed: \"when he wrote himself into the role of an ardent heterosexual lover... the characterisation is wooden. The master of the comic throw-away becomes too loquacious when he gets serious, and his fine words ring false.\"<ref>Lahr, p. 3</ref> At the first production, critical opinion agreed with Coward. ''[[The Times]]'' called it \"a serious and sympathetic study of humdrum people suddenly trapped by love\" and strongly praised Coward both for the play and his performance.<ref name=times>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''The Times'', 23 May 1936, p. 12</ref> In a 1989 study of Coward, Milton Levin wrote:\n{{blockindent|The theme that basic decency wins out is hardly a novel idea. Yet, both characters and their situation are endowed with a weight and substance that are rare for Coward. In large part the solidity of the refreshment room gives such reality to the lovers, but they are also very carefully observed individuals.

''[[The Times]]'' called it \"a serious and sympathetic study of humdrum people suddenly trapped by love\" and strongly praised Coward both for the play and his performance.<ref name=times>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''The Times'', 23 May 1936, p. 12</ref> In a 1989 study of Coward, Milton Levin wrote:\n{{blockindent|The theme that basic decency wins out is hardly a novel idea. Yet, both characters and their situation are endowed with a weight and substance that are rare for Coward. In large part the solidity of the refreshment room gives such reality to the lovers, but they are also very carefully observed individuals.
