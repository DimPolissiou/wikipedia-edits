In addition, according to music writer [[Dave Laing]],<ref name=stratton>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=cK-gFIUijQYC&pg=PA44&dq=%22beat+music%22#v=onepage&q=%22beat%20music%22&f=false |title=Britpop and the English Music Tradition (editors Andy Bennett, Jon Stratton) |pages=41\u201346|author=Jon Stratton|chapter=Englishing Popular Music in the 1960s|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2010|year=2010 |accessdate=2 July 2013|isbn=9780754668053 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"[T]he chord playing of the rhythm guitar was broken up into a series of separate strokes, often one to the bar, with the regular plodding of the bass guitar and crisp drumming behind it.  This gave a very different effect from the monolithic character of rock, in that the beat was given not by the duplication of one instrument in the rhythm section by another, but by an interplay between all three. This flexibility also meant that beat music could cope with a greater range of time-signatures and song shapes than rock & roll had been able to\".</blockquote>\n\nBeat groups usually had simple [[guitar]]-dominated line-ups, with [[Human voice|vocal]] [[harmonies]] and catchy tunes.<ref>J.

As the initial wave of rock and roll declined in the later 1950s, \"big beat\" music, later shortened to \"beat\", became a live dance alternative to the balladeers like [[Tommy Steele]], [[Marty Wilde]] and [[Cliff Richard]] who were dominating the charts.<ref name=Longhurst>B.

In addition, according to music writer [[Dave Laing]],<ref name=stratton>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=cK-gFIUijQYC&pg=PA44&dq=%22beat+music%22#v=onepage&q=%22beat%20music%22&f=false |title=Britpop and the English Music Tradition (editors Andy Bennett, Jon Stratton) |pages=41\u201346|author=Jon Stratton|chapter=Englishing Popular Music in the 1960s|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2010|year=2010 |accessdate=2 July 2013|isbn=9780754668053 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"[T]he chord playing of the rhythm guitar was broken up into a series of separate strokes, often one to the bar, with the regular plodding of the bass guitar and crisp drumming behind it.  This gave a very different effect from the monolithic character of rock, in that the beat was given not by the duplication of one instrument in the rhythm section by another, but by an interplay between all three. This flexibility also meant that beat music could cope with a greater range of time-signatures and song shapes than rock & roll had been able to\".</blockquote>\n\nBeat groups usually had simple [[guitar]]-dominated line-ups, with [[Human voice|vocal]] [[harmonies]] and catchy tunes.<ref>J.

British acts declined in popularity throughout the 1990s, and in the April 27, 2002 issue of ''Billboard'', none of the songs on the Hot 100 were from British artists; that week, only two of the top 100 albums, those of [[Craig David]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]], were from British artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2002/05/the_end_of_the_british_invasion.html|title=The end of the British invasion|last=Jenkins|first=Mark|website=Slate|date=3 May 2002|accessdate=2014-01-23}}</ref>\n\nThe most recent recognized movement came in the mid to late 2000s when British [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[British soul|soul]] artists such as [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]], [[Joss Stone]], [[Duffy (singer)|Duffy]], [[Natasha Bedingfield]], [[Florence Welch]], [[Adele]], [[Floetry]], [[Jessie J]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Jay Sean]] and [[Taio Cruz]] enjoyed huge success in the US charts, which led to talk of a \"[[Third British Invasion]]\" or a \"British Soul Invasion\".\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portalbar|1960s|Rock music|Music}}\n* [[Anglophile]]\n* [[Britpop]]\n* [[Cool Britannia]]\n* [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-ones by British artists|List of ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-ones by British artists]]\n* [[List of British Invasion artists]]\n* [[Music of the United Kingdom (1960s)]]\n* [[Second British Invasion]], 1980s\n\n== Further reading and listening ==\n* {{Gilliland|show=27|title=The British Are Coming!

British acts declined in popularity throughout the 1990s, and in the April 27, 2002 issue of ''Billboard'', none of the songs on the Hot 100 were from British artists; that week, only two of the top 100 albums, those of [[Craig David]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]], were from British artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2002/05/the_end_of_the_british_invasion.html|title=The end of the British invasion|last=Jenkins|first=Mark|website=Slate|date=3 May 2002|accessdate=2014-01-23}}</ref>\n\nThe most recent recognized movement came in the mid to late 2000s when British [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[British soul|soul]] artists such as [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]], [[Joss Stone]], [[Duffy (singer)|Duffy]], [[Natasha Bedingfield]], [[Florence Welch]], [[Adele]], [[Floetry]], [[Jessie J]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Jay Sean]] and [[Taio Cruz]] enjoyed huge success in the US charts, which led to talk of a \"[[Third British Invasion]]\" or a \"British Soul Invasion\".\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portalbar|1960s|Rock music|Music}}\n* [[Anglophile]]\n* [[Britpop]]\n* [[Cool Britannia]]\n* [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-ones by British artists|List of ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-ones by British artists]]\n* [[List of British Invasion artists]]\n* [[Music of the United Kingdom (1960s)]]\n* [[Second British Invasion]], 1980s\n\n== Further reading and listening ==\n* {{Gilliland|show=27|title=The British Are Coming!

Since then, only 22 male players have scored more at all the games played at the World Cup than St\u00e1bile did throughout the 1930 tournament. The first was [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]'s [[S\u00e1ndor Kocsis]] with eleven [[1954 FIFA World Cup|in 1954]]. At the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|next tournament]], France's [[Just Fontaine]] improved on this record with 13 goals in only six games. [[Gerd M\u00fcller]] scored 10 for [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] [[1970 FIFA World Cup|in 1970]] and broke the overall record when he scored his 14th goal in the World Cup final tournament during West Germany's win in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup Final|1974 final]]. His record stood for more than three decades until [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]'s 15 goals between [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. Germany's [[Miroslav Klose]] went on to score a record 16 goals across four consecutive tournaments between [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]]. Only two other players have surpassed 10 goals in the World Cup: [[Pel\u00e9]] with 12 between 1958 and 1970 for Brazil, and [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] with 11 between [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] and 1998 for Germany.\n\nOf all the players who have played in the men's World Cup finals, only six have achieved an average of two goals or more per game played: Kocsis, Fontaine, St\u00e1bile, [[Russia national football team|Russia]]'s [[Oleg Salenko]], [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]'s [[Josef H\u00fcgi]], and [[Poland national football team|Poland]]'s [[Ernst Wilimowski]] \u2014 the last of these scored four in his [[Brazil v Poland (1938 FIFA World Cup)|single World Cup game]] in 1938.<ref name=goalscorers>{{cite web|url= https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/statistics-and-records/worldcup/players/index.html |title= FIFA World Cup Players Statistics |publisher=FIFA|date=2014-07-25 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}</ref> The top 97 goalscorers have represented 28 nations, with 14 players scoring for Brazil, and another 14 for Germany or West Germany. In total, 64 footballers came from [[UEFA]] (Europe), 29 from [[CONMEBOL]] (South America), and only four from elsewhere: [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]], and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]].\n\nFontaine holds the record for the most goals scored at a single men's tournament, with 13 goals in 1958. The players that came closest were Kocsis in 1954, M\u00fcller in 1970 and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]'s [[Eus\u00e9bio]] [[1966 FIFA World Cup|in 1966]], with 11, 10 and 9, respectively. The lowest scoring top scorer was [[1962 FIFA World Cup|in 1962]], when six players tied at only four goals each. Across the 21 editions of the men's World Cup finals, 30 footballers have been credited with the most tournament goals, and no one has achieved this feat twice. Nine of them scored at least seven goals in a tournament, while Brazil's [[Jairzinho]] became the only footballer to score at least seven goals without being the top goalscorer of that tournament in 1970. These 30 top goalscorers played for 19 nations, the most (five) for Brazil. Another five came from other South American countries, with the remaining 20 coming from Europe. Excluding the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 edition]], all the top tournament scorers won the [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]].\n\n==Overall top male goalscorers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\u2666\n| Denotes national top scorers (or joint top scorers) at the World Cup\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |#\n| Denotes players still active at international level\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[ ]\n| Denotes tournaments where the player was part of the squad, but did not play in a match\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |( )\n| Denotes tournaments where the player played in a match, but did not score a goal\n|}\n\n[[File:Wolfgang Overath, Gerd Muller 1974.jpg|thumb|Gerd M\u00fcller ''(right)'' scored 14 goals for West Germany.|alt=Gerd M\u00fcller with a World Cup in his hand]]\n[[File:Pel\u00e9 jump 1958.jpg|thumb|Pel\u00e9 ''(right)'' scored 12 goals for Brazil.|alt=Pele jumping for the ball]]\n[[File:Thomas M\u00fcller, Germany national football team (03).jpg|thumb|Thomas M\u00fcller has scored 10 goals for Germany.|alt=Thomas M\u00fcller standing on a field]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0706-0040, Fu\u00dfball-WM, VR Polen - Brasilien 1-0.jpg|thumb|Grzegorz Lato ''(left)'' scored 10 goals for Poland.|alt=Grzegorz Lato is in the air]]\n[[File:Spain-Tahiti, Confederations Cup 2013 (18).jpg|thumb|David Villa ''(left)'' is the top World Cup goalscorer for Spain, with nine goals.|alt=David Villa walking on the field]]\n[[File:Valdomiro Vaz Franco, Roberto Rivelino, Jairzinho 1974.jpg|thumb|Jairzinho ''(upper right)'' and Roberto Rivellino ''(center)'' have scored nine and six goals, respectively, for Brazil.|alt=Four players talking to each other]]<!-- \n[[File:Johnny Rep 1974.jpg|thumb|Johnny Rep is the top World Cup goalscorer for the Netherlands, with 7 goals.]] -->\n<!-- [[File:NED-DEN Euro 2012 (10).jpg|thumb|Arjen Robben (orange, left) and Robin van Persie (orange, right) have scored 6 goals each for the Netherlands.]]\n[[File:Lothar Matth\u00e4us.jpg|thumb|Lothar Matth\u00e4us scored 6 goals in this record 25 matches at the World Cup.]]\n -->[[File:Landon Donovan corner kick.jpg|thumb|Landon Donovan is the first player from the United States to score five goals.|alt=Landon Donovan taking a corner kick]]\n<!-- [[File:Franz Beckenbauer 22-6-74.png|thumb|Franz Beckenbauer scored 5 goals for West Germany.]] -->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Players with at least 5 goals at the FIFA World Cup tournaments<ref name=goalscorers/><ref name=database>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/statistics-and-records/worldcup/index.html | title=FIFA World Cup All Time Statistics \u2014 All editions | publisher=FIFA| accessdate=2015-09-14}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Rank\n! scope=\"col\" |Player\n! scope=\"col\" |Team\n! scope=\"col\" |Goals<br>scored\n! scope=\"col\" |Matches<br>played\n! scope=\"col\" |{{Tooltip|Goals<br>per game<br>|Total number of goals scored divided by the total number of matches played}}{{refn|group=nb|Outside this list is [[Ernst Wilimowski]] of Poland, the player with the highest goals-to-games ratio in the World Cup.

Since then, only 22 players have scored more at all the games played at the World Cup than St\u00e1bile did throughout the 1930 tournament. The first was [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]'s [[S\u00e1ndor Kocsis]] with eleven [[1954 FIFA World Cup|in 1954]]. At the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|next tournament]], France's [[Just Fontaine]] improved on this record with 13 goals in only six games. [[Gerd M\u00fcller]] scored 10 for [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] [[1970 FIFA World Cup|in 1970]] and broke the overall record when he scored his 14th goal in the World Cup final tournament during West Germany's win in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup Final|1974 final]]. His record stood for more than three decades until [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]'s 15 goals between [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. Germany's [[Miroslav Klose]] went on to score a record 16 goals across four consecutive tournaments between [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]]. Only two other players have surpassed 10 goals in the World Cup: [[Pel\u00e9]] with 12 between 1958 and 1970 for Brazil, and [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] with 11 between [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] and 1998 for Germany.\n\nOf all the players who have played in the World Cup finals, only six have achieved an average of two goals or more per game played: Kocsis, Fontaine, St\u00e1bile, [[Russia national football team|Russia]]'s [[Oleg Salenko]], [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]'s [[Josef H\u00fcgi]], and [[Poland national football team|Poland]]'s [[Ernst Wilimowski]] \u2014 the last of these scored four in his [[Brazil v Poland (1938 FIFA World Cup)|single World Cup game]] in 1938.<ref name=goalscorers>{{cite web|url= https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/statistics-and-records/worldcup/players/index.html |title= FIFA World Cup Players Statistics |publisher=FIFA|date=2014-07-25 |accessdate=2014-07-30}}</ref> The top 97 goalscorers have represented 28 nations, with 14 players scoring for Brazil, and another 14 for Germany or West Germany. In total, 64 footballers came from [[UEFA]] (Europe), 29 from [[CONMEBOL]] (South America), and only four from elsewhere: [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]], and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]].\n\nFontaine holds the record for the most goals scored at a single tournament, with 13 goals in 1958. The players that came closest were Kocsis in 1954, M\u00fcller in 1970 and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]'s [[Eus\u00e9bio]] [[1966 FIFA World Cup|in 1966]], with 11, 10 and 9, respectively. The lowest scoring top scorer was [[1962 FIFA World Cup|in 1962]], when six players tied at only four goals each. Across the 21 editions of the World Cup finals, 30 footballers have been credited with the most tournament goals, and no one has achieved this feat twice. Nine of them scored at least seven goals in a tournament, while Brazil's [[Jairzinho]] became the only footballer to score at least seven goals without being the top goalscorer of that tournament in 1970. These 30 top goalscorers played for 19 nations, the most (five) for Brazil. Another five came from other South American countries, with the remaining 20 coming from Europe. Excluding the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 edition]], all the top tournament scorers won the [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]].\n\n==Overall top goalscorers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\u2666\n| Denotes national top scorers (or joint top scorers) at the World Cup\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |#\n| Denotes players still active at international level\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |[ ]\n| Denotes tournaments where the player was part of the squad, but did not play in a match\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |( )\n| Denotes tournaments where the player played in a match, but did not score a goal\n|}\n\n[[File:Wolfgang Overath, Gerd Muller 1974.jpg|thumb|Gerd M\u00fcller ''(right)'' scored 14 goals for West Germany.|alt=Gerd M\u00fcller with a World Cup in his hand]]\n[[File:Pel\u00e9 jump 1958.jpg|thumb|Pel\u00e9 ''(right)'' scored 12 goals for Brazil.|alt=Pele jumping for the ball]]\n[[File:Thomas M\u00fcller, Germany national football team (03).jpg|thumb|Thomas M\u00fcller has scored 10 goals for Germany.|alt=Thomas M\u00fcller standing on a field]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0706-0040, Fu\u00dfball-WM, VR Polen - Brasilien 1-0.jpg|thumb|Grzegorz Lato ''(left)'' scored 10 goals for Poland.|alt=Grzegorz Lato is in the air]]\n[[File:Spain-Tahiti, Confederations Cup 2013 (18).jpg|thumb|David Villa ''(left)'' is the top World Cup goalscorer for Spain, with nine goals.|alt=David Villa walking on the field]]\n[[File:Valdomiro Vaz Franco, Roberto Rivelino, Jairzinho 1974.jpg|thumb|Jairzinho ''(upper right)'' and Roberto Rivellino ''(center)'' have scored nine and six goals, respectively, for Brazil.|alt=Four players talking to each other]]<!-- \n[[File:Johnny Rep 1974.jpg|thumb|Johnny Rep is the top World Cup goalscorer for the Netherlands, with 7 goals.]] -->\n<!-- [[File:NED-DEN Euro 2012 (10).jpg|thumb|Arjen Robben (orange, left) and Robin van Persie (orange, right) have scored 6 goals each for the Netherlands.]]\n[[File:Lothar Matth\u00e4us.jpg|thumb|Lothar Matth\u00e4us scored 6 goals in this record 25 matches at the World Cup.]]\n -->[[File:Landon Donovan corner kick.jpg|thumb|Landon Donovan is the first player from the United States to score five goals.|alt=Landon Donovan taking a corner kick]]\n<!-- [[File:Franz Beckenbauer 22-6-74.png|thumb|Franz Beckenbauer scored 5 goals for West Germany.]] -->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Players with at least 5 goals at the FIFA World Cup tournaments<ref name=goalscorers/><ref name=database>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/statistics-and-records/worldcup/index.html | title=FIFA World Cup All Time Statistics \u2014 All editions | publisher=FIFA| accessdate=2015-09-14}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Rank\n! scope=\"col\" |Player\n! scope=\"col\" |Team\n! scope=\"col\" |Goals<br>scored\n! scope=\"col\" |Matches<br>played\n! scope=\"col\" |{{Tooltip|Goals<br>per game<br>|Total number of goals scored divided by the total number of matches played}}{{refn|group=nb|Outside this list is [[Ernst Wilimowski]] of Poland, the player with the highest goals-to-games ratio in the World Cup.

{"title_page": "1928 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1928 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was its 19th. It was a very busy season, with ten representative fixtures including matches against the touring [[England national rugby league team|England]] team. The senior club season featured over 110 matches through various competitions and did not finish until late October when suburban cricket competitions had already begun.\n\n[[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] won the Senior A Championship for the first time under the [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] name, though they had won it twice before as [[North Shore Albions]], prior to the merger with Sunnyside. [[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the Roope Rooster Trophy for the first time. This was their first major rugby league trophy and they also went on to defeat Devonport to win the Stormont Shield. [[Grafton Athletic rugby league team|Grafton]] won the Senior B Grade competition with an undefeated season, though they were beaten in the promotion relegation match with [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. [[Point Chevalier Pirates|Point Chevalier]] defeated [[Grafton Athletic rugby league team|Grafton]] in the Stallard Cup final which was the Senior B knockout competition. The season was notable for the number of teams which played sides from other areas. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]], [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]], [[Parnell rugby league club|Parnell]], and the [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote and Birkenhead Ramblers]] all played sides from north Auckland and the [[Waikato]].\n\nAt the annual general meeting of [[Auckland Rugby League]] it was noted that out of the 28 playing days during the 1927 season thirteen of them were played in wet weather however crowds were still good and they were happy with the growth of the game. It was also planned for further developments at [[Carlaw Park]] consisting of \u201cconveniences for ladies\u2026extra accommodation\u2026 for players, and three more dressing rooms\u201d at a cost of \u00a360. There was a lengthy discussion about [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie's]] application to join the A Grade. They had won the B Grade competition and defeated the last placed Grafton from A Grade.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Governing Body/Report on the Past Season\n| page = 17\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19907\n| date = 1928-03-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280328.2.154\n| accessdate = 2019-09-29}}</ref> The annual general meeting was held at the [[Auckland Chamber of Commerce]] on Swanson Street.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Activities/Mew Officers Elected/Plans for Coming Season\n| page = 15\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19920\n| date = 1928-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280413.2.165.5\n| accessdate = 2019-09-30}}</ref>\n\nThe Management Committee announced at the midway mark of the senior club season that the Thistle Cup would be awarded to the A or B grade team that had scored the most points in the second round of competition. If two teams were tied then the trophy would be awarded to the team which had scored the most points for the whole season.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Management Committee/Thistle Cup Competition\n| page = 15\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19978\n| date = 1928-06-21\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280621.2.167.4\n| accessdate = 2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\n==Ground Availability==\nAn ongoing issue for many clubs in Auckland was the availability of playing fields as the number of teams grew. During the season [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] opened a new field at Stafford Park which is still in existence adjacent to State Highway 1 just north of the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]]. Devonport also had a deputation present at the [[Devonport Borough Council]] meeting on 10 May to ask about the shortage of grounds in the area. The club asked for permission to use some of the spare cricket grounds for matches. The Mayor, Mr. E. Aldridge said there would be a ground available at Stanley Bay.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Devonport Borough/Shortage of Sports Areas\n| page = 12\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19943\n| date = 1928-05-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280511.2.133\n| accessdate = 2019-10-01}}</ref>\n\n==Rule Changes==\nAfter Round 5 the issue of time keeping in matches at [[Carlaw Park]] was raised at the weekly Management Committee meeting. The bell had been rung in the match between [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] and Devonport at [[Carlaw Park]] before the ball was dead which was against previously arranged rules. Agreement could not be reached on whether the timekeeper or referee should be responsible for calling time. In the end it was decided that official timekeepers should attend the Referees\u2019 Association meeting for instructions.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Management Committee/The Calling of Time/Proposed Match for June 4\n| page = 13\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIX| issue=121\n| date = 1928-05-24\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19280524.2.126.3\n| accessdate = 2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nIt was noted that the dead ball area on both fields at [[Carlaw Park]] had been reduced from 12 yards to 8yards in accordance with the laws of Rugby League.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Senior Matches/Individual Scorers\u2019 List/Taylor Leads the Way\n| page = 16\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19971\n| date = 1928-06-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280613.2.177.2\n| accessdate = 2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nA rule change came into effect during the season after the annual meeting of the [[Rugby Football League|English Rugby League]]. They decided that no forward at any time in the scrum could have both feet off the ground. Also forwards could not drop to one knee to attempt to hook the ball. The game in New Zealand would adhere to these rules.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Amendments to Scrum Laws\n| page = 15\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19983\n| date = 1928-06-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280627.2.148.4\n| accessdate = 2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1927 Auckland Rugby League season|1927]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=19th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1928}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1929 Auckland Rugby League season|1929]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n==First Grade Championship==\n===Final A Grade Standings===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]]\n|12||9||0||3||224||149||'''18'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]]\n|12||7||1||4||143||132||'''15'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|12||7||0||5||143||138||'''14'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]\n|12||5||2||5||154||144||'''12'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]\n|12||5||1||6||154||170||'''11'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|12||4||0||8||144||164||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]\n|12||3||0||9||102||162||'''6'''\n|-\n|}\n\n===First Grade A Division Fixtures===\nThe opening weekend of the season saw 4 first grade matches played at [[Carlaw Park]], though these matches were not part of the competition. The round was dedicated to Richard Stack (commonly known as Dick Stack) of the [[Newton Rangers]] who had suffered a broken leg in the Stormont Shield final the previous season and the injury was so bad [[Auckland Hospital]] staff were forced to amputate it. This mean that he was unable to continue in his career and so the league fundraised for him to start him in his own business. \u00a3500 was taken at the gates for him. The day also featured a program of boxing matches with the prizes donated back to Stack. After all the accounts were balanced it was worked out that the fund for Stack totalled \u00a3610 12/3.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Stack Benefit/Sum of \u00a3610 for League Football Player/A Pleasing Effort\n| page = 3\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIX| issue=152\n| date = 1928-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19280629.2.15\n| accessdate = 2019-09-10}}</ref>\n\nRound 1 saw the newly promoted [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] upset [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]]. The season was ceremonially kicked off by Miss Peggy Rhodes, daughter of George Rhodes, the chairman of [[Auckland Rugby League]] Management Committee.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the first ground of Senior A Grade matches ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' published for the first time the individual points tallies of all the point scorers. This was the first time this had been done. Taylor of [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] led the standings with 46 points, L. Scott of [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] had 33, while [[Craddock Dufty|Dufty]] of [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] was third with 26 points.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Senior Matches/Individual Scorers\u2019 List/Taylor Leads the Way\n| page = 16\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19971\n| date = 1928-06-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280613.2.177.2\n| accessdate = 2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nIt was decided by [[Auckland Rugby League]] after the 3rd round that they would no longer play curtain-raiser matches by Senior A Grade teams at 1:30pm. This was due to players having difficulty getting to the ground on time as they often worked on Saturdays and had to travel from the outer suburbs. A recent example had been the [[Newton Rangers]] v [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] match where several [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] players had arrived late and the match was so late kicking off that the second half lasted only 25 minutes instead of 40.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Stack Benefit Fund/Next Saturday\u2019s Attraction/Devonport and Richmond\n| page = 16\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19947\n| date = 1928-05-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280516.2.171.2\n| accessdate = 2019-10-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Round 6 match between [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] was played on the Kings Birthday holiday as part of the celebrations.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | 1928 First Grade Results\n|-\n|\n!

It was a very busy season, with ten representative fixtures including matches against the touring [[England national rugby league team|England]] team. The senior club season featured over 110 matches through various competitions and did not finish until late October when suburban cricket competitions had already begun.\n\n[[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] won the Senior A Championship for the first time under the [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] name, though they had won it twice before as [[North Shore Albions]], prior to the merger with Sunnyside. [[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the Roope Rooster Trophy for the first time. This was their first major rugby league trophy and they also went on to defeat Devonport to win the Stormont Shield. [[Grafton Athletic rugby league team|Grafton]] won the Senior B Grade competition with an undefeated season, though they were beaten in the promotion relegation match with [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. [[Point Chevalier Pirates|Point Chevalier]] defeated [[Grafton Athletic rugby league team|Grafton]] in the Stallard Cup final which was the Senior B knockout competition. The season was notable for the number of teams which played sides from other areas. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]], [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]], [[Parnell rugby league club|Parnell]], and the [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote and Birkenhead Ramblers]] all played sides from north Auckland and the [[Waikato]].\n\nAt the annual general meeting of [[Auckland Rugby League]] it was noted that out of the 28 playing days during the 1927 season thirteen of them were played in wet weather however crowds were still good and they were happy with the growth of the game. It was also planned for further developments at [[Carlaw Park]] consisting of \u201cconveniences for ladies\u2026extra accommodation\u2026 for players, and three more dressing rooms\u201d at a cost of \u00a360.

Devonport also had a deputation present at the [[Devonport Borough Council]] meeting on 10 May to ask about the shortage of grounds in the area. The club asked for permission to use some of the spare cricket grounds for matches. The Mayor, Mr. E.

This mean that he was unable to continue in his career and so the league fundraised for him to start him in his own business. \u00a3500 was taken at the gates for him.

{"title_page": "List of children's hospitals in the United States", "text_new": "A [[children's hospital]] is a hospital that offers its services exclusively to children and adolescents. Most children's hospitals can serve children from birth up to the age of 21. The number of children's hospitals proliferated in the 20th century, as pediatric medical and surgical specialties separated from internal medicine and adult surgical specialties.\n\nChildren's hospitals are characterized by greater attention to the psychosocial support of children and their families. Some children and young people have to spend relatively long periods in the hospital, so having access to play and teaching staff can also be an important part of their care. With local partnerships, this can include trips to local botanical gardens, the zoo, and public libraries, for instance.\n\nIn addition to psychosocial support, children's hospitals have the added benefit of being staffed by professionals who are trained in treating children. A medical doctor that undertakes vocational training in pediatrics must also be accepted for membership by a professional college before they can practice pediatrics. While many normal hospitals can treat children adequately, pediatric specialists may be a better choice when it comes to treating rare afflictions that may prove fatal or severely detrimental to young children, in some cases before birth. Also, many children's hospitals will continue to see children with rare illnesses into adulthood, allowing for a continuity of care.\n{| class=\"wikitable

the United States| ]]\n", "text_old": "A [[children's hospital]] is a hospital that offers its services exclusively to children and adolescents. Most children's hospitals can serve children from birth up to the age of 21. The number of children's hospitals proliferated in the 20th century, as pediatric medical and surgical specialties separated from internal medicine and adult surgical specialties.\n\nChildren's hospitals are characterized by greater attention to the psychosocial support of children and their families. Some children and young people have to spend relatively long periods in the hospital, so having access to play and teaching staff can also be an important part of their care. With local partnerships, this can include trips to local botanical gardens, the zoo, and public libraries, for instance.\n\nIn addition to psychosocial support, children's hospitals have the added benefit of being staffed by professionals who are trained in treating children. A medical doctor that undertakes vocational training in pediatrics must also be accepted for membership by a professional college before they can practice pediatrics. While many normal hospitals can treat children adequately, pediatric specialists may be a better choice when it comes to treating rare afflictions that may prove fatal or severely detrimental to young children, in some cases before birth. Also, many children's hospitals will continue to see children with rare illnesses into adulthood, allowing for a continuity of care.\n{| class=\"wikitable

A [[spiritual successor]] to 2004's ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'', it is the second game in the ''[[Red Dead]]'' series, and was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in May 2010. ''Red Dead Redemption'' is set during the decline of the [[American frontier]] in the year 1911 and follows [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]], a former outlaw whose wife and son are taken hostage by the government in ransom for his services as a hired gun. Having no other choice, Marston sets out to bring three members of his former gang to justice.\n\nThe game is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]] in an [[open world]], allowing the player to interact with the game world at their leisure. The player can travel the virtual world, a fictionalized version of the [[Western United States]] and [[Mexico]], primarily by [[Equestrianism|horseback]] and on foot. Gunfights emphasize a [[gunslinger]] gameplay mechanic called \"[[Bullet time|Dead Eye]]\" that allows players to mark multiple shooting targets on enemies in slow motion. The game makes use of a morality system, by which the player's actions in the game affect their character's levels of honor and fame and how [[Non-player character|other characters]] respond to the player. An [[Multiplayer online game|online multiplayer]] mode is included with the game, allowing up to 16 players to engage in both [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\n''Red Dead Redemption'' was [[Development of Red Dead Redemption|developed]] over the course of five years and is one of the [[List of most expensive video games to develop|most expensive video games]] ever made. The game received critical acclaim for its visuals, dynamically-generated music, voice acting, gameplay, and story, and shipped over 15 million copies by 2017. It won several year-end accolades, including [[Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]], and is considered by critics as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]]. After the game's release, several [[downloadable content]] additions were released; ''[[Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare]]'', later released as a standalone game, added a new single-player experience in which Marston searches for a cure for an infectious [[Zombie apocalypse|zombie plague]] that has swept across the Old West. A ''Game of the Year Edition'' containing all additional content was released in October 2011. A prequel, ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'', was released in October 2018 to similar acclaim.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Red Dead Redemption'' is a [[Western (genre)|Western]]-themed [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. The player controls [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]] and completes missions, linear scenarios with set objectives, to progress through the story. Outside of missions, players may [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] the [[open world]]. The player can interact with the environment and engage in combat with enemies, using various firearms. Different breeds of horses are the main forms of transportation, each with different attributes. These horses must be tamed in order to use them. The player can utilize trains for quick travelling, but they can also stop the train by threatening or killing the passengers or driver. The game's undeveloped land makes up the largest portion of the game world, featuring various rugged and vast landscapes with occasional travelers, bandits, and wildlife. Urban settlements range from isolated farmhouses to crowded towns. Besides the American West, the player can also traverse a fictional Mexican state bordering the United States.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\nIn addition to following the main storyline, the player will witness and can take part in random events they encounter as they explore the game world. These include public hangings, ambushes, pleas for assistance, encounters with strangers, ride-by shootings, and dangerous animal attacks. For example, if a group of people ride into town firing guns in the air, Marston can kill them, and will receive a bonus of honor and fame for protecting the town. The player can also take part in optional side activities, most of which give the player money. These side activities include dueling, in which the player must be a [[Fast Draw|faster draw]] than their opponent; bounty hunting, where Marston can hunt down bounties on [[wanted poster]]s; herb collecting, which involves gathering exotic plants from around the game map for town medics; gambling, where people can be found playing games such as poker and [[Knife game|Five Finger Fillet]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/11841/rockstar-game-tips-becoming-an-ace-online-poker-player-red-dead-.html |title=Rockstar Games Tips: Becoming an Ace Online Poker Player (Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare Collection / Liars and Cheats Pack) |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |author=R* Y |date=November 16, 2010 |accessdate=April 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"kotaku eyeson\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5272049/red-dead-redemption-eyes-on-impressions |title=Red Dead Redemption Eyes-On Impressions |website=Kotaku |date=May 28, 2009 |first=Michael |last=McWhertor |accessdate=April 10, 2013}}</ref> and hunting, in which the player can kill wild animals and skin their hides.<ref name=\"kotaku eyeson\" />\n\n''Red Dead Redemption'' makes use of a morality system where players have the ability to gain positive or negative honor.<ref name=\"Manual\" >{{cite book |author=[[Rockstar San Diego]] |title=Red Dead Redemption ''Game Manual'' |url=http://epix.xbox.com/shaXam/0201/55/78/5578b04b-140d-4a53-bc07-091cf1b372c5.PDF?v=1#rdr-en.PDF |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]]}}</ref> Honor can be gained by making morally positive choices, such as taking in an outlaw alive or saving a woman from a kidnapping. The player's overall honor standard is lowered for committing crimes or other negative choices. This works in conjunction with another system, fame, which affects how people react based on Marston's honor status. If Marston has little honor, [[non-player character]]s will feel insecure around them. If they have a high amount of honor, other characters will usually greet them and feel safe around them. They will also receive discounts in some stores, more pay for jobs and other bonuses.<ref name=\"Manual\"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Cocker |first=Guy |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/reddeadredemption/news.html?sid=6248188&mode=previews |title=Red Dead Redemption Hands-On\u2014Xbox 360 Previews at GameSpot |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=March 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601062455/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/reddeadredemption/news.html?sid=6248188&mode=previews |archivedate=June 1, 2010}}</ref> A very low honor rating can result in a town's establishments closing their doors when Marston arrives. To combat this they can disguise themselves by wearing a [[bandana]] when performing criminal acts; alternatively, a very negative or criminal reputation warrants the player a large amount of respect and steep discounts from bandits and fencers at criminal hideouts, such as Thieves' Landing.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\n=== Combat ===\n[[File:RedDeadRedemptionGameplay.jpg|thumb|left|''Red Dead Redemption'' features a [[cover system]] that lets the player hide behind objects and reach out to fire on people and animals.]]\nGunfights are a major gameplay mechanic in ''Red Dead Redemption''. The player can take cover, target a specific person or animal, [[blindfire]], and free aim. Individual body parts can also be targeted, in order to take targets down non-lethally. When the player shoots an enemy, the game engine uniquely creates the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] reactions and movements depending on where they were hit. The player can choose from period-accurate weapons including revolvers, pistols, lever or bolt-action rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, explosives, lassos, mounted [[Gatling gun]]s, and cannons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption/features/weapons/ |title=Features: Weapons |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date= |accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref> Duels utilize a [[gunslinger]] gameplay mechanic known as Dead Eye. Dead Eye is a targeting system that is used in a [[bullet time]]-like manner, allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise shot or paint in multiple shots. When the targeting sequence ends, Marston automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\nAdopted from the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]], ''Red Dead Redemption'' has a modified wanted system. When the player commits a crime, such as killing people near witnesses, some will run to the nearest police station. The player can either bribe or kill them before they reach the station, negating any consequences. If a crime is committed near a lawman or constable, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. The higher the bounty, the more lawmen will be sent after the player. If they kill enough pursuers, then either [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] or the [[Mexican Army]], depending on their location, will be sent instead. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, the player must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear.<ref name=\"Manual\"/> Regardless of whether they escape capture, a bounty is placed upon the player which will cause bounty hunters to come after them in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away the player's weapon and standing still as they will kill them regardless. Only lawmen in towns and [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posses]] will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase the player, unless they pay their bounty at a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, the player pays off their bounty, spends a certain number of days in jail depending on the severity of their crimes, and is then released. If the player does not have enough money to pay back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities to complete until enough money is earned.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\n''Red Dead Redemption'' includes online multiplayer with a maximum of 16 players per session. Every multiplayer game, both free-for-all and team based, will begin with a [[Mexican standoff]]. Survivors of the standoff will be able to move to any part of the battlefield in preparation for respawning enemies. Crates in the environment contain extra weapons, ammo, and other [[powerup]]s. Players can level up and complete weapon challenges which earn them rewards such as new character models, golden weapon skins, new titles, and new breeds of [[Riding animal|animal mounts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/08/red-dead-redemption-online-free-roam-multiplayer-revealed/ |title=Red Dead Redemption's online 'Multiplayer Free Roam' revealed |first=Andrew |last=Yoon |publisher=Joystiq |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |date=April 8, 2010}}</ref> Additional multiplayer modes were added via [[downloadable content]] (DLC). Stronghold is an attack or defend scenario, with teams switching roles as the round ends. It is included in the ''Liars and Cheats'' pack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-08-27-red-deads-liars-and-cheats-pack-dated |website=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |date=August 27, 2012 |first=Tom |last=Bramwell |title=Red Dead's Liars and Cheats Pack dated}}</ref> The ''[[Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare|Undead Nightmare]]'' pack included two new games modes: Undead overrun mode, and Land Grab.

Many [[capture the flag]] variants are also available. Hold Your Own is a traditional mode where each team has to defend their bag of gold from the enemy team whilst capturing the other. Grab The Bag has both teams attacking one bag placed in a section of the map. Gold Rush is a free-for-all variant, trying to grab and keep as many bags as possible.

The game takes place primarily in the year 1911, featuring the final decade of the [[American frontier]] and the cowboy and outlaw archetypes that shaped it. The landscape of the Wild West is beginning to fade and modern technologies like automobiles, machine guns, and oil drilling projects are beginning to appear.\n\n===Plot===\n{{See also|List of Red Dead Redemption characters}}\nThe game begins in 1911, where former outlaw John Marston ([[Rob Wiethoff]]) is taken from his family by [[Bureau of Investigation]] agents Edgar Ross (Jim Bentley) and his partner, Archer Fordham ([[David Wilson Barnes]]), and will only be granted amnesty when he brings the remaining members of his old gang to justice. John is escorted to the town of Armadillo and sets off to track down former ally Bill Williamson ([[Steve J. Palmer]]). He confronts Williamson and his men at their stronghold, Fort Mercer, only to be shot and left for dead. Local rancher Bonnie MacFarlane (Kimberly Irion) finds him critically wounded and takes him to her ranch for recovery. Several days later, John begins performing tasks and favors for various allies in exchange for their help with organizing an attack on Fort Mercer. John and his group then breach the fort and defeat Williamson's gang only to find that Williamson has fled to Mexico to seek help from Javier Escuella (Antonio Jaramillo), another former member of John's gang.\n\nIn Mexico, John initially sides with Mexican Army Colonel Agust\u00edn Allende (Gary Carlos Cervantes) to help end a rebellion in return for Allende delivering Escuella and Williamson to him. However, Allende betrays John, who then sides with the rebels. John, along with rebel leader Abraham Reyes ([[Josh Segarra]]), eventually turns the tide in favor of the rebels, launching an assault on the El Presidio fortress. They find Escuella, who attempts to bargain for his life by revealing that Williamson has been under Allende's protection. John is given the option to either kill Escuella or turn him over to the Bureau. John and Reyes then take the fight to Allende. As Allende's palace is stormed by the rebels, both he and Williamson flee but are apprehended and killed. Reyes takes charge of the local government and plans to advance on the capital, while John leaves to meet with the Bureau in Blackwater.\n\nRoss and Fordham refuse to let John return to his family until he assists the Bureau in hunting down the only remaining member of his previous gang who is still active as an outlaw: its leader and John's surrogate father, Dutch van der Linde ([[Benjamin Byron Davis]]). After surviving several ambushes and thwarting a bank robbery, John joins Ross, Fordham, and a group of U.S. soldiers in an attack on Dutch's hideout. During the assault, John chases Dutch up to a cliff, where the latter, mortally wounded, warns John that the Bureau won't let him have peace and then commits suicide by backing off the cliff.\n\nJohn is released from his deal and returns home to his wife Abigail (Sophie Marzocchi) and son Jack ([[Josh Blaylock]]). John devotes his time tending to the ranch, having sworn to keep himself and his family away from the outlaw lifestyle forever. However, true to Dutch's word, Ross double-crosses John and leads a combined force of soldiers, lawmen, and government agents after him. John fends off several waves of attackers and gets his family to safety, but stays behind to hold back the rest. Despite a valiant last stand, he dies after being shot numerous times by Ross and his men and is buried by his family on the hill overlooking the ranch.\n\nThree years later in 1914, following the death of his mother, Jack tracks down the now-retired Ross and kills him in a duel, avenging his father and continuing the path of violence his father had tried to keep away from him. The fates of John's companions are later summarized in newspaper articles and NPC dialog: Marshal Leigh Johnson retired from Armadillo at age 54 and moved away, Reyes was consumed by power and became a tyrant, Bonnie MacFarlane eventually married, Irish shot himself dead in an outhouse when his gun accidentally discharged, Seth Briars eventually found treasure and became rich, and Landon Ricketts died quietly in his sleep.\n\n==Development==\n{{Main|Development of Red Dead Redemption}}\n\n[[Rockstar San Diego]] began to [[Development of Red Dead Redemption|develop ''Red Dead Redemption'']] in 2005.

Erik Brudvig of [[IGN]] lauded the environmental details, noting the player can even scare a flock of birds from the bushes as they ride past. He also noted that the game's dynamic events, weather and ambient sounds provide a rich experience for players. He summarized by stating \"you can also expect a fantastic game that offers the Western experience we've all been waiting for.\"<ref name=\"ign review\" /> ''[[Game Informer]]'' called the scenery \"breathtaking\", and the cinematic cutscenes \"vastly improved\" over ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', and named it the \"best-looking Rockstar game to date\".<ref name=\"GI\"/>\n\n[[File:Red Dead Redemption - Gameplay.ogv|thumb|left|300px|thumbtime=0:16|The portion of the game in which Marston enters Mexico was acclaimed by critics and players.

He also criticized the [[Experience point|leveling]] and unlocking aspects, noting that \"The first few minutes spent as a toothless miner riding a balky mule can be pretty humiliating\".<ref name=\"1up review\" /> [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]]'s Jake Gaskill echoed this sentiment.

A [[spiritual successor]] to 2004's ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'', it is the second game in the ''[[Red Dead]]'' series, and was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in May 2010. ''Red Dead Redemption'' is set during the decline of the [[American frontier]] in the year 1911 and follows [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]], a former outlaw whose wife and son are taken hostage by the government in ransom for his services as a hired gun. Having no other choice, Marston sets out to bring three members of his former gang to justice.\n\nThe game is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]] in an [[open world]], allowing the player to interact with the game world at their leisure. The player can travel the virtual world, a fictionalized version of the [[Western United States]] and [[Mexico]], primarily by [[Equestrianism|horseback]] and on foot. Gunfights emphasize a [[gunslinger]] gameplay mechanic called \"[[Bullet time|Dead Eye]]\" that allows players to mark multiple shooting targets on enemies in slow motion. The game makes use of a morality system, by which the player's actions in the game affect their character's levels of honor and fame and how [[Non-player character|other characters]] respond to the player. An [[Multiplayer online game|online multiplayer]] mode is included with the game, allowing up to 16 players to engage in both [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\n''Red Dead Redemption'' was [[Development of Red Dead Redemption|developed]] over the course of five years and is one of the [[List of most expensive video games to develop|most expensive video games]] ever made. The game received critical acclaim for its visuals, dynamically-generated music, voice acting, gameplay, and story, and shipped over 15 million copies by 2017. It won several year-end accolades, including [[Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]], and is considered by critics as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]]. After the game's release, several [[downloadable content]] additions were released; ''[[Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare]]'', later released as a standalone game, added a new single-player experience in which Marston searches for a cure for an infectious [[Zombie apocalypse|zombie plague]] that has swept across the Old West. A ''Game of the Year Edition'' containing all additional content was released in October 2011. A prequel, ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'', was released in October 2018 to similar acclaim.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Red Dead Redemption'' is a [[Western (genre)|Western]]-themed [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. The player controls [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]] and completes missions, linear scenarios with set objectives, to progress through the story. Outside of missions, players may [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] the [[open world]]. The player can interact with the environment and engage in combat with enemies, using various firearms. Different breeds of horses are the main forms of transportation, each with different attributes. These horses must be tamed in order to use them. The player can utilize trains for quick travelling, but they can also stop the train by threatening or killing the passengers or driver. The game's undeveloped land makes up the largest portion of the game world, featuring various rugged and vast landscapes with occasional travelers, bandits, and wildlife. Urban settlements range from isolated farmhouses to crowded towns. Besides the American West, the player can also traverse a fictional Mexican state bordering the United States.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\nIn addition to following the main storyline, the player will witness and can take part in random events they encounter as they explore the game world. These include public hangings, ambushes, pleas for assistance, encounters with strangers, ride-by shootings, and dangerous animal attacks. For example, if a group of people ride into town firing guns in the air, Marston can kill them, and will receive a bonus of honor and fame for protecting the town. The player can also take part in optional side activities, most of which give the player money. These side activities include dueling, in which the player must be a [[Fast Draw|faster draw]] than their opponent; bounty hunting, where Marston can hunt down bounties on [[wanted poster]]s; herb collecting, which involves gathering exotic plants from around the game map for town medics; gambling, where people can be found playing games such as poker and [[Knife game|Five Finger Fillet]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/11841/rockstar-game-tips-becoming-an-ace-online-poker-player-red-dead-.html |title=Rockstar Games Tips: Becoming an Ace Online Poker Player (Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare Collection / Liars and Cheats Pack) |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |author=R* Y |date=November 16, 2010 |accessdate=April 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"kotaku eyeson\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5272049/red-dead-redemption-eyes-on-impressions |title=Red Dead Redemption Eyes-On Impressions |website=Kotaku |date=May 28, 2009 |first=Michael |last=McWhertor |accessdate=April 10, 2013}}</ref> and hunting, in which the player can kill wild animals and skin their hides.<ref name=\"kotaku eyeson\" />\n\n''Red Dead Redemption'' makes use of a morality system where players have the ability to gain positive or negative honor.<ref name=\"Manual\" >{{cite book |author=[[Rockstar San Diego]] |title=Red Dead Redemption ''Game Manual'' |url=http://epix.xbox.com/shaXam/0201/55/78/5578b04b-140d-4a53-bc07-091cf1b372c5.PDF?v=1#rdr-en.PDF |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]]}}</ref> Honor can be gained by making morally positive choices, such as taking in an outlaw alive or saving a woman from a kidnapping. The player's overall honor standard is lowered for committing crimes or other negative choices. This works in conjunction with another system, fame, which affects how people react based on Marston's honor status. If Marston has little honor, [[non-player character]]s will feel insecure around them. If they have a high amount of honor, other characters will usually greet them and feel safe around them. They will also receive discounts in some stores, more pay for jobs and other bonuses.<ref name=\"Manual\"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Cocker |first=Guy |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/reddeadredemption/news.html?sid=6248188&mode=previews |title=Red Dead Redemption Hands-On\u2014Xbox 360 Previews at GameSpot |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=March 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601062455/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/reddeadredemption/news.html?sid=6248188&mode=previews |archivedate=June 1, 2010}}</ref> A very low honor rating can result in a town's establishments closing their doors when Marston arrives. To combat this they can disguise themselves by wearing a [[bandana]] when performing criminal acts; alternatively, a very negative or criminal reputation warrants the player a large amount of respect and steep discounts from bandits and fencers at criminal hideouts, such as Thieves' Landing.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\n=== Combat ===\n[[File:RedDeadRedemptionGameplay.jpg|thumb|left|''Red Dead Redemption'' features a [[cover system]] that lets the player hide behind objects and reach out to fire on people and animals.]]\nGunfights are a major gameplay mechanic in ''Red Dead Redemption''. The player can take cover, target a specific person or animal, [[blindfire]], and free aim. Individual body parts can also be targeted, in order to take targets down non-lethally. When the player shoots an enemy, the game engine uniquely creates the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]] reactions and movements depending on where they were hit. The player can choose from period-accurate weapons including revolvers, pistols, lever or bolt-action rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, explosives, lassos, mounted [[Gatling gun]]s, and cannons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption/features/weapons/ |title=Features: Weapons |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date= |accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref> Duels utilize a [[gunslinger]] gameplay mechanic known as Dead Eye. Dead Eye is a targeting system that is used in a [[bullet time]]-like manner, allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise shot or paint in multiple shots. When the targeting sequence ends, Marston automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\nAdopted from the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]], ''Red Dead Redemption'' has a modified wanted system. When the player commits a crime, such as killing people near witnesses, some will run to the nearest police station. The player can either bribe or kill them before they reach the station, negating any consequences. If a crime is committed near a lawman or constable, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. The higher the bounty, the more lawmen will be sent after the player. If they kill enough pursuers, then either [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] or the [[Mexican Army]], depending on their location, will be sent instead. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, the player must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear.<ref name=\"Manual\"/> Regardless of whether they escape capture, a bounty is placed upon the player which will cause bounty hunters to come after them in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away the player's weapon and standing still as they will kill them regardless. Only lawmen in towns and [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posses]] will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase the player, unless they pay their bounty at a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, the player pays off their bounty, spends a certain number of days in jail depending on the severity of their crimes, and is then released. If the player does not have enough money to pay back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities to complete until enough money is earned.<ref name=\"Manual\"/>\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\n''Red Dead Redemption'' includes online multiplayer with a maximum of 16 players per session. Every multiplayer game, both free-for-all and team based, will begin with a [[Mexican standoff]]. Survivors of the standoff will be able to move to any part of the battlefield in preparation for respawning enemies. Crates in the environment contain extra weapons, ammo, and other [[powerup]]s. Players can level up and complete weapon challenges which earn them rewards such as new character models, golden weapon skins, new titles, and new breeds of [[Riding animal|animal mounts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/08/red-dead-redemption-online-free-roam-multiplayer-revealed/ |title=Red Dead Redemption's online 'Multiplayer Free Roam' revealed |first=Andrew |last=Yoon |publisher=Joystiq |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |date=April 8, 2010}}</ref> Additional multiplayer modes were added via [[downloadable content]] (DLC).

New Austin and West Elizabeth are adjacent to each other and share a southern border with Mexico. Nuevo Paraiso is a Mexican state, separated from U.S. territory by the San Luis River. The game takes place primarily in the year 1911, featuring the final decade of the [[American frontier]] and the cowboy and outlaw archetypes that shaped it. The landscape of the Wild West is beginning to fade and modern technologies like automobiles, machine guns, and oil drilling projects are beginning to appear.\n\n===Plot===\n{{See also|List of Red Dead Redemption characters}}\nThe game begins in 1911, where former outlaw John Marston ([[Rob Wiethoff]]) is taken from his family by [[Bureau of Investigation]] agents Edgar Ross (Jim Bentley) and his partner, Archer Fordham ([[David Wilson Barnes]]), and will only be granted amnesty when he brings the remaining members of his old gang to justice. John is escorted to the town of Armadillo and sets off to track down former ally Bill Williamson ([[Steve J. Palmer]]). He confronts Williamson and his men at their stronghold, Fort Mercer, only to be shot and left for dead. Local rancher Bonnie MacFarlane (Kimberly Irion) finds him critically wounded and takes him to her ranch for recovery. Several days later, John begins performing tasks and favors for various allies in exchange for their help with organizing an attack on Fort Mercer. John and his group then breach the fort and defeat Williamson's gang only to find that Williamson has fled to Mexico to seek help from Javier Escuella (Antonio Jaramillo), another former member of John's gang.\n\nIn Mexico, John initially sides with Mexican Army Colonel Agust\u00edn Allende (Gary Carlos Cervantes) to help end a rebellion in return for Allende delivering Escuella and Williamson to him. However, Allende betrays John, who then sides with the rebels. John, along with rebel leader Abraham Reyes ([[Josh Segarra]]), eventually turns the tide in favor of the rebels, launching an assault on the El Presidio fortress. They find Escuella, who attempts to bargain for his life by revealing that Williamson has been under Allende's protection. John is given the option to either kill Escuella or turn him over to the Bureau. John and Reyes then take the fight to Allende. As Allende's palace is stormed by the rebels, both he and Williamson flee but are apprehended and killed. Reyes takes charge of the local government and plans to advance on the capital, while John leaves to meet with the Bureau in Blackwater.\n\nRoss and Fordham refuse to let John return to his family until he assists the Bureau in hunting down the only remaining member of his previous gang who is still active as an outlaw: its leader and John's surrogate father, Dutch van der Linde ([[Benjamin Byron Davis]]). After surviving several ambushes and thwarting a bank robbery, John joins Ross, Fordham, and a group of U.S. soldiers in an attack on Dutch's hideout. During the assault, John chases Dutch up to a cliff, where the latter, mortally wounded, warns John that the Bureau won't let him have peace and then commits suicide by backing off the cliff.\n\nJohn is released from his deal and returns home to his wife Abigail (Sophie Marzocchi) and son Jack ([[Josh Blaylock]]). John devotes his time tending to the ranch, having sworn to keep himself and his family away from the outlaw lifestyle forever. However, true to Dutch's word, Ross double-crosses John and leads a combined force of soldiers, lawmen, and government agents after him. John fends off several waves of attackers and gets his family to safety, but stays behind to hold back the rest. Despite a valiant last stand, he dies after being shot numerous times by Ross and his men and is buried by his family on the hill overlooking the ranch.\n\nThree years later in 1914, following the death of his mother, Jack tracks down the now-retired Ross and kills him in a duel, avenging his father and continuing the path of violence his father had tried to keep away from him. The fates of John's companions are later summarized in newspaper articles and NPC dialog: Marshal Leigh Johnson retired from Armadillo at age 54 and moved away, Reyes was consumed by power and became a tyrant, Bonnie MacFarlane eventually married, Irish shot himself dead in an outhouse when his gun accidentally discharged, Seth Briars eventually found treasure and became rich, and Landon Ricketts died quietly in his sleep.\n\n==Development==\n{{Main|Development of Red Dead Redemption}}\n\n[[Rockstar San Diego]] began to [[Development of Red Dead Redemption|develop ''Red Dead Redemption'']] in 2005.

Erik Brudvig of [[IGN]] lauded the environmental details, noting the player can even scare a flock of birds from the bushes as they ride past. He also noted that the game's dynamic events, weather and ambient sounds provide a rich experience for players. He summarized by stating \"you can also expect a fantastic game that offers the Western experience we've all been waiting for.\"<ref name=\"ign review\" /> ''[[Game Informer]]'' called the scenery \"breathtaking\", and the cinematic cutscenes \"vastly improved\" over ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', and named it the \"best-looking Rockstar game to date\".<ref name=\"GI\"/>\n\n[[File:Red Dead Redemption - Gameplay.ogv|thumb|left|300px|thumbtime=0:16|The portion of the game in which Marston enters Mexico was acclaimed by critics and players.

''Game Informer'' said that Rockstar \"[transposed] the ''Grand Theft Auto'' gameplay template onto a Wild West setting\".<ref name=\"GI\"/> ''[[Good Game (television series)|Good Game]]'' reviewer [[Stephanie Bendixsen|Stephanie \"Hex\" Bendixsen]] said that \"[Rockstar] really looked at what people liked and didn't like in their game design from [''Grand Theft Auto IV''], and included it here\".<ref name=\"GG\" >{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s2914340.htm |title=Good Game stories&nbsp;\u2014 Red Dead Redemption |author=''[[Good Game (television series)|Good Game]]'' |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=May 31, 2010}}</ref> [[Eurogamer]]'s Simon Parkin felt ''Red Dead Redemption'' successfully \"re-clothes\" the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' framework in an \"exciting, distinct and expertly realised scenario\".<ref name=\"eurogamer review\" />\n\nThe multiplayer aspect of ''Red Dead Redemption'' received mixed commentary from critics. ''[[GamePro]]''{{'}}s Will Herring praised the variety of multiplayer modes and the open gameplay, but noted that it put more responsibility on the players for keeping the game interesting.<ref name=\"gamepro review\" /> Justin Calvert of [[GameSpot]] also gave high marks for the game's variety of multiplayer modes, but felt that there was a lack in customization options for players.<ref name=\"GSpotReview\" /> In a more critical view of multiplayer, Scott Sharkey of [[1UP.com]] noted that games can suffer from [[Griefer|griefing]]{{efn|name=\"Friendly\"}} due to the open nature of multiplayer gameplay. He also criticized the [[Experience point|leveling]] and unlocking aspects, noting that \"The first few minutes spent as a toothless miner riding a balky mule can be pretty humiliating\".<ref name=\"1up review\" /> [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]]'s Jake Gaskill echoed this sentiment. He noted that the game often [[Spawning (video game)|respawns]] players in a similar location to their death, which allows the killing player to repeatedly grief the other player.<ref name=\"g4tv review\">{{cite web |url=http://g4tv.com/games/xbox-360/57148/Red-Dead-Redemption/review/ |title=Red Dead Redemption Review |first=Jake |last=Gaskill |publisher=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]] |date=May 17, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2010}}</ref> Rockstar has since added a feature which allows for players being griefed to transport to another area upon respawn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.216461-Rockstar-Bringing-New-Law-to-Red-Dead-Redemptions-Multiplayer |title=The Escapist: Forums: The News Room: Rockstar Bringing New Law to Red Dead Redemption's Multiplayer |accessdate=March 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Accolades ===\nSince its release, ''Red Dead Redemption'' has received a large number of awards.

In 1961, he became the first American to travel into space, and in 1971, he walked on the [[Moon]].\n\nA graduate of the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis]], Shepard saw action with the surface navy during [[World War II]]. He became a naval aviator in 1946, and a test pilot in 1950. He was selected as one of the original [[NASA]] [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts in 1959, and in May 1961 he made the first crewed [[Project Mercury]] flight, [[Mercury-Redstone 3]], in a spacecraft he named ''Freedom 7''. His craft entered space, but was not capable of achieving [[orbit]]. He became the second person, and the first American, to travel into space, and the first space traveler to manually control the orientation of his craft. In the final stages of Project Mercury, Shepard was scheduled to pilot the [[Mercury-Atlas 10]] (MA-10), which was planned as a three-day mission. He named Mercury Spacecraft 15B ''Freedom 7 II'' in honor of his first spacecraft, but the mission was canceled.\n\nShepard was designated as the commander of the first crewed [[Project Gemini]] mission, but was grounded in 1963 due to [[M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease]], an inner-ear ailment that caused episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea. This was surgically corrected in 1969, and in 1971, Shepard commanded the [[Apollo 14]] mission, piloting the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] ''Antares'' to the most accurate landing of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions. At age 47, he became [[List of Apollo astronauts|the fifth, the oldest, and the earliest-born person to walk on the Moon]], and the only one of the Mercury Seven astronauts to do so. During the mission, he hit two [[golf ball]]s on the [[lunar surface]].\n\nShepard was [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]] from November 1963 to July 1969 (the approximate period of his grounding), and from June 1971 until his retirement from the [[United States Navy]] and NASA on August 1, 1974. He was promoted to rear admiral on August 25, 1971, the first astronaut to reach that rank.\n\n==Early life==\nAlan Bartlett Shepard Jr. was born on November 18, 1923, in [[Derry, New Hampshire]],{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=7}} to Alan B. Shepard Sr. and Pauline Renza Shepard ({{nee|Emerson}}).{{sfn|Burgess|2014|p=69}} He had a younger sister, Pauline, who was known as Polly.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=8}} He was one of many famous descendants of ''[[Mayflower]]'' passenger [[Richard Warren]].{{sfn|Burgess|2014|p=69}} His father, Alan B. Shepard Sr., known as Bart, worked in the Derry National Bank, owned by Shepard's grandfather. Alan Sr. joined the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] in 1915 and served in France with the [[American Expeditionary Force]] during [[World War I]].{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=10}} He remained in the National Guard between the wars, and was recalled to active duty during [[World War II]], rising to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]].{{sfn|Burgess|2014|p=70}}\n\nShepard attended Adams School in Derry, where his academic performance impressed his teachers; he skipped the sixth grade,{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=16\u201318}} and proceeded to [[middle school]] at Oak Street School in Derry,{{sfn|Burgess|2014|p=70}} where he skipped the eighth grade.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=16\u201318}} He achieved the [[Boy Scouts of America]] rank of [[First Class Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|First Class Scout]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.usscouts.org/eagle/eagleastronauts.asp |title=Astronauts With Scouting Experience|website=U.S. Scouting Service Project |access-date=May 1, 2019}}</ref> In 1936, he went to the [[Pinkerton Academy]], a private school in Derry that his father had attended and where his grandfather had been a trustee. He completed years 9 to 12 there.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=16\u201318}} Fascinated by flight, he created a model airplane club at the Academy, and his Christmas present in 1938 was a flight in a [[Douglas DC-3]].{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=20\u201324}} The following year he began cycling to [[Manchester\u2013Boston Regional Airport|Manchester Airfield]], where he would do odd jobs in exchange for the occasional ride in an airplane or informal flying lesson.{{sfn|Shepard et al.|2010|p=64}}{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=24\u201327}}\n\nShepard graduated from Pinkerton Academy in 1940. Because World War II was already raging in Europe, his father wanted him to join the Army. Shepard chose the Navy instead. He easily passed the entrance exam to the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis]] in 1940, but at sixteen was too young to enter that year. The Navy sent him to the [[Admiral Farragut Academy]], a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] for the Naval Academy, from which he graduated with the Class of 1941.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=27\u201329}} Tests administered at Farragut indicated an [[IQ]] of 145, but his grades were mediocre.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=36\u201337}}\n\nAt Annapolis, Shepard enjoyed [[aquatic sports]]. He was a keen and competitive sailor, winning several races, including a [[regatta]] held by the Annapolis Yacht Club. He learned to sail all the types of boats the academy owned, up to and including {{USS|Freedom|IX-43|6}}, a {{convert|90|ft|adj=on}} [[schooner]].

The squadron was nominally based on the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Franklin D.

He departed on his first cruise, of the [[Caribbean]], on ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'' with VF-42 in 1948. Most of the aviators were, like Shepard, on their first assignment. Those who were not were given the opportunity to qualify for night landings on a carrier, a dangerous maneuver, especially in a Corsair, which had to bank sharply on approach. Shepard managed to persuade his squadron commander to allow him to qualify as well. After briefly returning to Norfolk, the carrier set out on a nine-month tour of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. He earned a reputation for carousing and chasing women. He also instituted a ritual of, whenever he could, calling Louise at 17:00 (her time) each day.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=109\u2013114}}\n\nNormally sea duty alternated with periods of duty ashore.

The squadron was part of Commander [[James D. Ramage|James D. \"Jig Dog\" Ramage]]'s Air Group 19. Naval aviators with experience in jet aircraft were still relatively rare, and Ramage specifically requested Shepard's assignment on the advice of Elder, who commanded VF-193's sister squadron, [[VF-191]]. Ramage made Shepard his own [[wingman]],{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=144\u2013148}} a decision that would save Ramage's life in 1954, when his oxygen system failed and Shepard talked him through a landing.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=167\u2013169}} As squadron operations officer, Shepard's most important task was imparting his knowledge of flying jets to his fellow aviators to keep them alive.

He was unable to break out of the spin and was forced to eject. In 1957, he was project test pilot on the [[Douglas F5D Skylancer]]. Shepard did not like the plane, and gave it an unfavorable report. The Navy canceled orders for it, buying the F8U instead. He also filed an unfavorable report on the F11F after a harrowing incident in which the engine failed on him during a high-speed dive.

This shattered American confidence in its technological superiority, creating a wave of anxiety known as the [[Sputnik crisis]]. Among his responses, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] launched the [[Space Race]]. The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) was established on October 1, 1958, as a civilian agency to develop space technology. One of its first initiatives was publicly announced on December 17, 1958. This was [[Project Mercury]],{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=25\u201329}} which aimed to launch a man into [[Earth orbit]], return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=134}}\n\nNASA received permission from Eisenhower to recruit its first [[astronaut]]s from the ranks of military test pilots. The service records of 508 graduates of test pilot schools were obtained from the [[United States Department of Defense]]. From these, 110 were found that matched the minimum standards:{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=36\u201339}} the candidates had to be younger than 40, possess a bachelor's degree or equivalent and to be {{convert|5|ft|11|in}} or less. While these were not all strictly enforced, the height requirement was firm, owing to the size of the Project Mercury spacecraft.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=35}} The 110 were then split into three groups, with the most promising in the first group.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=38}}\n\nThe first group of 35, which included Shepard, assembled at [[the Pentagon]] on February 2, 1959. The Navy and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] officers were welcomed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]], while the [[United States Air Force]] officers were addressed by the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]]. Both pledged their support to the Space Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They conceded that it would be a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance. That evening, Shepard discussed the day's events with fellow naval aviators [[Jim Lovell]], [[Pete Conrad]] and [[Wally Schirra]], all of whom would eventually become astronauts. They were concerned about their careers, but decided to volunteer.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=46\u201351}}{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=40\u201342}}\n\nThe briefing process was repeated with a second group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six were found to be over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|p=42}} Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the [[Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute|Lovelace Clinic]] and the [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory]].{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=43\u201347}} Only one candidate, Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error;{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=234\u2013237}} thirteen others were recommended with reservations.

Stafford]] chosen as his pilot.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=345\u2013346}} In late 1963, Shepard began to experience episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea, accompanied by a loud, clanging noise in the left ear. He tried to keep it secret, fearing that he would lose his flight status, but was aware that if an episode occurred in the air or in space it could be fatal. Following an episode during a lecture in Houston, where he had recently moved from [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], Shepard was forced to confess his ailment to Slayton, who was now Director of Flight Operations, and seek help from NASA's doctors.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=350\u2013351}}\n\nThe doctors diagnosed [[M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease]], a condition in which fluid pressure builds up in the inner ear. This syndrome causes the semicircular canals and motion detectors to become extremely sensitive, resulting in disorientation, dizziness, and nausea. There was no known cure, but in about 20 percent of cases the condition went away by itself. They prescribed [[diuretic]]s in an attempt to drain the fluid from the ear. They also diagnosed [[glaucoma]]. An X-ray found a lump on his [[thyroid]], and on January 17, 1964, surgeons at [[Hermann Hospital]] made an incision on his throat and removed 20 percent of his thyroid.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=352\u2013354}}{{sfn|Shepard & Slayton|1994|pp=168\u2013170}} The condition caused Shepard to be removed from flight status. Grissom and [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] flew [[Gemini 3]] instead.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=366}}\n\nShepard was designated [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]] in November 1963.{{sfn|Shayler|2001|p=97}} He thereby became responsible for NASA astronaut training. This involved the development of appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment to be used by astronauts on space missions.<ref name=\"40th\" /> He also was on the selection panel for the [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]] in 1966.{{sfn|Burgess|2013|pp=50\u201352}} He spent much of his time investing in banks, [[wildcatting]], and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in [[Weatherford, Texas]], that raised horses and cattle.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=362\u2013363}} During this period, his secretary had several [[head shot]] photographs taken of Shepard, posed with various expressions on his face. She would post these on the door to his private office, with a sign which said \"Mood of the Day\". Visitors could then look at the photo to decide whether it was a good time to talk to him.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=359\u2013360}} [[Tom Wolfe]] characterized Shepard's dual personalities as \"Smilin' Al\" and the \"Icy Commander\".{{sfn|Wolfe|1979|pp=172\u2013173}} \"Inside his locker\", Wolfe wrote, \"he kept Smilin' Al of the Cape!\" {{quote|Then Al looked like a different human being, as if he had removed his ice mask.

Shepard flew to Los Angeles, where he met with [[William F. House]]. House proposed to open Shepard's [[mastoid bone]] and make a tiny hole in the [[endolymphatic sac]]. A small tube was inserted to drain excess fluid. The surgery was conducted in early 1969 at [[St. Vincent Medical Center (Los Angeles)|St. Vincent's Hospital]] in Los Angeles, where Shepard checked in under the pseudonym of Victor Poulos.<ref name=\"40th\" />{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=386\u2013387}} The surgery was successful, and he was restored to full flight status on May 7, 1969.<ref name=\"40th\" />\n\nShepard and Slayton put Shepard down to command the next available Moon mission, which was [[Apollo 13]] in 1970. Under normal circumstances, this assignment would have gone to Cooper, as the backup commander of [[Apollo 10]], but Cooper was swept aside. A rookie, [[Stuart Roosa]], was designated the [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|Command Module]] Pilot. Shepard asked for [[Jim McDivitt]] as his [[Lunar Module]] Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the [[Apollo 9]] mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training to command a Moon mission. A rookie, [[Edgar Mitchell]], was designated the Lunar Module Pilot instead.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=390\u2013393}}{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=235\u2013238}}\n\n[[File:Alan Shepard during training for the Apollo 14 mission.jpg|thumb|left|Shepard in front of the [[Lunar Landing Research Vehicle]] during training for Apollo 14 |alt=Shepard stands in a white flight suit in front of a vehicle made of tubing, with two metal spheres and a small cabin]]\nWhen Slayton submitted the proposed crew assignments to NASA headquarters, [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] turned them down on the grounds that the crew was too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, who had been the backup commander for [[Apollo 11]], and was slated to command [[Apollo 14]], if his crew would be willing to fly Apollo 13 instead. He agreed to do so, and Shepard's inexperienced crew was assigned to Apollo 14.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=390\u2013393}}{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=235\u2013238}}\n\nNeither Shepard nor Lovell expected there would be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14,{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=390\u2013393}} but Apollo 13 disastrously  blew it's side. An oxygen tank explosion caused the Moon landing to be aborted and nearly resulted in the loss of the crew. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the [[Fra Mauro formation]], the intended destination of Apollo 13.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=402\u2013406}}\n\nShepard made his second space flight as Commander of Apollo 14 from January 31 to February 9, 1971. It was America's third successful [[List of lunar astronauts|lunar landing mission]]. Shepard piloted the Lunar Module ''Antares'' to the most accurate landing of the entire Apollo program.<ref name=\"Apollo 14\" /> He became the fifth and, at the age of 47, the oldest man to walk on the Moon, and the only one of the Mercury Seven astronauts to do so.<ref name=\"The moon walkers\">{{cite news |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jul/09/apollo-astronauts-walking-moon |title=The moon walkers: Twelve men who have visited another world |first=Christopher |last=Riley |date=July 10, 2009 |accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref>{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=407}}\n\nThis was the first mission to broadcast extensive color television coverage from the lunar surface, using the [[Apollo TV camera#Westinghouse Lunar Color Camera|Westinghouse Lunar Color Camera]].

In 1961, he became the first American to travel into space, and in 1971, he walked on the [[Moon]].\n\nA graduate of the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis]], Shepard saw action with the surface navy during [[World War II]]. He became a naval aviator in 1946, and a test pilot in 1950. He was selected as one of the original [[NASA]] [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts in 1959, and in May 1961 he made the first crewed [[Project Mercury]] flight, [[Mercury-Redstone 3]], in a spacecraft he named ''Freedom 7''. His craft entered space, but was not capable of achieving [[orbit]]. He became the second person, and the first American, to travel into space, and the first space traveler to manually control the orientation of his craft. In the final stages of Project Mercury, Shepard was scheduled to pilot the [[Mercury-Atlas 10]] (MA-10), which was planned as a three-day mission. He named Mercury Spacecraft 15B ''Freedom 7 II'' in honor of his first spacecraft, but the mission was canceled.\n\nShepard was designated as the commander of the first crewed [[Project Gemini]] mission, but was grounded in 1963 due to [[M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease]], an inner-ear ailment that caused episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea. This was surgically corrected in 1969, and in 1971, Shepard commanded the [[Apollo 14]] mission, piloting the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] ''Antares'' to the most accurate landing of the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions. At age 47, he became [[List of Apollo astronauts|the fifth, the oldest, and the earliest-born person to walk on the Moon]], and the only one of the Mercury Seven astronauts to do so. During the mission, he hit two [[golf ball]]s on the [[lunar surface]].\n\nShepard was [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]] from November 1963 to July 1969 (the approximate period of his grounding), and from June 1971 until his retirement from the [[United States Navy]] and NASA on August 1, 1974. He was promoted to rear admiral on August 25, 1971, the first astronaut to reach that rank.\n\n==Early life==\nAlan Bartlett Shepard Jr. was born on November 18, 1923, in [[Derry, New Hampshire]],{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=7}} to Alan B.

Because World War II was already raging in Europe, his father wanted him to join the Army. Shepard chose the Navy instead. He easily passed the entrance exam to the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis]] in 1940, but at sixteen was too young to enter that year. The Navy sent him to the [[Admiral Farragut Academy]], a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] for the Naval Academy, from which he graduated with the Class of 1941.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=27\u201329}} Tests administered at Farragut indicated an [[IQ]] of 145, but his grades were mediocre.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=36\u201337}}\n\nAt Annapolis, Shepard enjoyed [[aquatic sports]]. He was a keen and competitive sailor, winning several races, including a [[regatta]] held by the Annapolis Yacht Club. He learned to sail all the types of boats the academy owned, up to and including {{USS|Freedom|IX-43|6}}, a {{convert|90|ft|adj=on}} [[schooner]]. He also participated in swimming, and rowed with the [[eight (rowing)|eight]].{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=36\u201337}} During his Christmas break in 1942, he went to [[Principia College]] to be with his sister, who was unable to go home owing to wartime travel restrictions.

The job of the radar pickets was to warn the fleet of incoming kamikazes, but because they were often the first ships sighted by incoming Japanese aircraft, they were also the most likely ships to be attacked. ''Cogswell'' performed this duty from May 27, 1945, until June 26, when it rejoined [[Task Force 38]]. The ship also participated in the [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|Allied naval bombardments of Japan]], and was present in [[Tokyo Bay]] for the [[Surrender of Japan]] in September 1945.

He was sent to [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]] in Florida for advanced training. His final test was six perfect landings on the carrier {{USS|Saipan|CVL-48|6}}. The following day, he received his [[United States Naval Aviator|naval aviator]] [[United States Aviator Badge|wings]], which his father pinned on his chest.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=100\u2013103}}\n\nShepard was assigned to [[Attack Squadron 42 (United States Navy)|Fighter Squadron 42]] (VF-42), flying the [[Vought F4U Corsair]]. The squadron was nominally based on the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Franklin D.

He departed on his first cruise, of the [[Caribbean]], on ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'' with VF-42 in 1948. Most of the aviators were, like Shepard, on their first assignment. Those who were not were given the opportunity to qualify for night landings on a carrier, a dangerous maneuver, especially in a Corsair, which had to bank sharply on approach. Shepard managed to persuade his squadron commander to allow him to qualify as well. After briefly returning to Norfolk, the carrier set out on a nine-month tour of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. He earned a reputation for carousing and chasing women. He also instituted a ritual of, whenever he could, calling Louise at 17:00 (her time) each day.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=109\u2013114}}\n\nNormally sea duty alternated with periods of duty ashore.

The squadron was part of Commander [[James D. Ramage|James D. \"Jig Dog\" Ramage]]'s Air Group 19. Naval aviators with experience in jet aircraft were still relatively rare, and Ramage specifically requested Shepard's assignment on the advice of Elder, who commanded VF-193's sister squadron, [[VF-191]]. Ramage made Shepard his own [[wingman]],{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=144\u2013148}} a decision that would save Ramage's life in 1954, when his oxygen system failed and Shepard talked him through a landing.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=167\u2013169}} As squadron operations officer, Shepard's most important task was imparting his knowledge of flying jets to his fellow aviators to keep them alive.

He was unable to break out of the spin and was forced to eject. In 1957, he was project test pilot on the [[Douglas F5D Skylancer]]. Shepard did not like the plane, and gave it an unfavorable report. The Navy canceled orders for it, buying the F8U instead. He also filed an unfavorable report on the F11F after a harrowing incident in which the engine failed on him during a high-speed dive.

This shattered American confidence in its technological superiority, creating a wave of anxiety known as the [[Sputnik crisis]]. Among his responses, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] launched the [[Space Race]]. The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) was established on October 1, 1958, as a civilian agency to develop space technology. One of its first initiatives was publicly announced on December 17, 1958. This was [[Project Mercury]],{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=25\u201329}} which aimed to launch a man into [[Earth orbit]], return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=134}}\n\nNASA received permission from Eisenhower to recruit its first [[astronaut]]s from the ranks of military test pilots. The service records of 508 graduates of test pilot schools were obtained from the [[United States Department of Defense]]. From these, 110 were found that matched the minimum standards:{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=36\u201339}} the candidates had to be younger than 40, possess a bachelor's degree or equivalent and to be {{convert|5|ft|11|in}} or less. While these were not all strictly enforced, the height requirement was firm, owing to the size of the Project Mercury spacecraft.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=35}} The 110 were then split into three groups, with the most promising in the first group.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|p=38}}\n\nThe first group of 35, which included Shepard, assembled at [[the Pentagon]] on February 2, 1959. The Navy and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] officers were welcomed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]], while the [[United States Air Force]] officers were addressed by the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]]. Both pledged their support to the Space Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They conceded that it would be a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance. That evening, Shepard discussed the day's events with fellow naval aviators [[Jim Lovell]], [[Pete Conrad]] and [[Wally Schirra]], all of whom would eventually become astronauts. They were concerned about their careers, but decided to volunteer.{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=46\u201351}}{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=40\u201342}}\n\nThe briefing process was repeated with a second group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six were found to be over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six.{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|p=42}} Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the [[Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute|Lovelace Clinic]] and the [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory]].{{sfn|Atkinson|Shafritz|1985|pp=43\u201347}} Only one candidate, Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error;{{sfn|Burgess|2011|pp=234\u2013237}} thirteen others were recommended with reservations.

Stafford]] chosen as his pilot.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=345\u2013346}} In late 1963, Shepard began to experience episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea, accompanied by a loud, clanging noise in the left ear. He tried to keep it secret, fearing that he would lose his flight status, but was aware that if an episode occurred in the air or in space it could be fatal. Following an episode during a lecture in Houston, where he had recently moved from [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], Shepard was forced to confess his ailment to Slayton, who was now Director of Flight Operations, and seek help from NASA's doctors.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=350\u2013351}}\n\nThe doctors diagnosed [[M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease]], a condition in which fluid pressure builds up in the inner ear. This syndrome causes the semicircular canals and motion detectors to become extremely sensitive, resulting in disorientation, dizziness, and nausea. There was no known cure, but in about 20 percent of cases the condition went away by itself. They prescribed [[diuretic]]s in an attempt to drain the fluid from the ear. They also diagnosed [[glaucoma]]. An X-ray found a lump on his [[thyroid]], and on January 17, 1964, surgeons at [[Hermann Hospital]] made an incision on his throat and removed 20 percent of his thyroid.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=352\u2013354}}{{sfn|Shepard & Slayton|1994|pp=168\u2013170}} The condition caused Shepard to be removed from flight status. Grissom and [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] flew [[Gemini 3]] instead.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=366}}\n\nShepard was designated [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]] in November 1963.{{sfn|Shayler|2001|p=97}} He thereby became responsible for NASA astronaut training. This involved the development of appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment to be used by astronauts on space missions.<ref name=\"40th\" /> He also was on the selection panel for the [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]] in 1966.{{sfn|Burgess|2013|pp=50\u201352}} He spent much of his time investing in banks, [[wildcatting]], and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in [[Weatherford, Texas]], that raised horses and cattle.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=362\u2013363}} During this period, his secretary had several [[head shot]] photographs taken of Shepard, posed with various expressions on his face. She would post these on the door to his private office, with a sign which said \"Mood of the Day\". Visitors could then look at the photo to decide whether it was a good time to talk to him.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=359\u2013360}} [[Tom Wolfe]] characterized Shepard's dual personalities as \"Smilin' Al\" and the \"Icy Commander\".{{sfn|Wolfe|1979|pp=172\u2013173}} \"Inside his locker\", Wolfe wrote, \"he kept Smilin' Al of the Cape!\" {{quote|Then Al looked like a different human being, as if he had removed his ice mask.

Shepard flew to Los Angeles, where he met with [[William F. House]]. House proposed to open Shepard's [[mastoid bone]] and make a tiny hole in the [[endolymphatic sac]]. A small tube was inserted to drain excess fluid. The surgery was conducted in early 1969 at [[St. Vincent Medical Center (Los Angeles)|St. Vincent's Hospital]] in Los Angeles, where Shepard checked in under the pseudonym of Victor Poulos.<ref name=\"40th\" />{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=386\u2013387}} The surgery was successful, and he was restored to full flight status on May 7, 1969.<ref name=\"40th\" />\n\nShepard and Slayton put Shepard down to command the next available Moon mission, which was [[Apollo 13]] in 1970. Under normal circumstances, this assignment would have gone to Cooper, as the backup commander of [[Apollo 10]], but Cooper was swept aside. A rookie, [[Stuart Roosa]], was designated the [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|Command Module]] Pilot. Shepard asked for [[Jim McDivitt]] as his [[Lunar Module]] Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the [[Apollo 9]] mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training to command a Moon mission. A rookie, [[Edgar Mitchell]], was designated the Lunar Module Pilot instead.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=390\u2013393}}{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=235\u2013238}}\n\n[[File:Alan Shepard during training for the Apollo 14 mission.jpg|thumb|left|Shepard in front of the [[Lunar Landing Research Vehicle]] during training for Apollo 14 |alt=Shepard stands in a white flight suit in front of a vehicle made of tubing, with two metal spheres and a small cabin]]\nWhen Slayton submitted the proposed crew assignments to NASA headquarters, [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] turned them down on the grounds that the crew was too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, who had been the backup commander for [[Apollo 11]], and was slated to command [[Apollo 14]], if his crew would be willing to fly Apollo 13 instead. He agreed to do so, and Shepard's inexperienced crew was assigned to Apollo 14.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=390\u2013393}}{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=235\u2013238}}\n\nNeither Shepard nor Lovell expected there would be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14,{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=390\u2013393}} but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion caused the Moon landing to be aborted and nearly resulted in the loss of the crew. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the [[Fra Mauro formation]], the intended destination of Apollo 13.{{sfn|Thompson|2004|pp=402\u2013406}}\n\nShepard made his second space flight as Commander of Apollo 14 from January 31 to February 9, 1971.

The top eight teams in each conference ([[Eastern Conference (NBA)|East]] and [[Western Conference (NBA)|West]]), ranked in order by win-loss records, qualify for the playoffs. The tie-break criteria for playoff seeding and home-court advantage have also changed; head-to-head results between the tied teams is the first tie-breaker, and whether a team won its division championship is the second tie-breaker.<ref name=\"NBA20150908\">{{cite press release|title=NBA to seed conference playoff teams by record|url=http://www.nba.com/2015/news/09/08/nba-to-seed-conference-playoff-teams-by-record/index.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=September 8, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBoth conferences conduct the playoffs in the traditional bracket format. All rounds are [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] series. Series are played in the 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage hosts games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while their opponent hosts games 3, 4, and 6, with games 5\u20137 being played if needed. This format has been used since [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2014]], after NBA team owners unanimously voted to change the format of the NBA finals from the 2\u20133\u20132 format on October 23, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/10/23/nba-board-of-governors-format-change.ap/ |title=NBA owners change Finals format to 2-2-1-1-1 |publisher=NBA.com |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n\nThe most common criticism of the current structure is related to parity of conferences. On numerous occasions, [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] teams with losing records qualified for the playoffs, while [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] teams with winning records ended up missing them, including the [[2011 NBA playoffs|2011]], [[2013 NBA playoffs|2013]] and the [[2015 NBA playoffs]]. Weaker Eastern Conference teams also often make it farther in the playoffs due to the conference imbalance.\n\n==History==\nThe National Basketball Association was established in 1949 by merger of the [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA) and [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] but it recognizes the three BAA seasons as part of its own history. In all of its three years the BAA champion was finally determined in a best-of-seven series but its first two tournaments, the [[1947 BAA Playoffs|1947]] and [[1948 BAA Playoffs]], were otherwise quite different from the third, which 21st-century NBA playoffs nearly match. In 1947 and 1948, the Eastern and Western Division champions were matched in a [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] series following the regular season, whose winner advanced to the championship round. Meanwhile, four runners-up played best-of-three series to determine the other finalist: the two second-place teams were matched in one short series and the two third-place teams in another; the winners of those two series played another one. In 1947 the [[Philadelphia Warriors]] won the runners-up bracket and beat the Western champion [[Chicago Stags]] four games to one, which the NBA recognizes as its first championship; in 1948 Baltimore won the runners-up and beat Eastern champion Philadelphia in the final. Both tournaments generated one finalist from the Eastern and one from the Western Division, but only by chance.<ref name=BBR>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/BAA_1947.html \"1946\u201347 BAA Season Summary\"]. <br>&nbsp; [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/BAA_1948.html \"1947\u201348 BAA Season Summary\"].

At the same time, the number of playoff teams was increased from three to four from each Division; two rounds of best-of-three series were played, followed by a best-of-seven championship. The main idea was retained by the NBA. Even the [[1950 NBA Playoffs|1950 tournament]], following a transitional season with three divisions rather than two, initially determined one playoff champion from each division. The Central champion [[Minneapolis Lakers]] became the first league champion under the NBA name by defeating Anderson from the West in a best-of-three, with Syracuse from the East idle, and then knocking off the [[Syracuse Nationals]] in six games.<ref name=BBR2>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/BAA_1949.html \"1948\u201349 BAA Season Summary\"]. <br>&nbsp; [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1950.html \"1949\u201350 NBA Season Summary\"]. Basketball-Reference.com. Retrieved 2015-03-01.</ref>\n\nThe 1951 through 1953 playoffs changed the division finals into a [[best-of-five playoff]]. With only nine league members in 1953\u201354, the NBA cut its postseason tournament field from eight teams to six (from 1954 through 1966, the period of eight to nine league members). [[Round-robin tournament|Round robins]] were played in 1954, uniquely in NBA history\u2014a three-team round robin among the three playoff teams in each division. From 1955 to 1966, the first-place team in each division was idle while its two runners-up faced played a best-of-three. Division finals were expanded to best-of-seven in 1958 and division semifinals to best-of-five in 1961.\n\nWith ten league members again for the 1966\u201367 season, eight teams were again admitted to the tournament, providing a simple three-round knockout (8-team bracket). A year later, the division semifinals were changed to best-of-seven playoff.  Then, in 1975 and 1977, respectively, a fifth and sixth team were added to each Division, necessitating an additional first round of best-of-three series.\n\nFinally in 1984, the tournament expanded to its present 16-team, four-round knockout, and the now-complete set of first-round series were expanded to a best-of-five. In 2003 the first round was changed to also be best-of-seven.\n\nBeginning with the 2004 season, with the addition of the thirtieth NBA franchise, the [[Charlotte Bobcats]], the NBA realigned its divisions. The result was that each conference would have three divisions of five teams each, and the winner of each division was guaranteed a top-three playoff seed. This would change slightly after the 2005\u201306 season; while division winners still receive automatic playoff berths, they are guaranteed a top-''four'' seed, as described below.\n\n===2006 NBA playoffs controversy===\nThe previous playoff format, in place for the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 NBA playoffs, after the NBA was re-aligned into six divisions, created controversy during the 2005\u201306 season and playoffs and would be changed prior to the 2006\u201307 NBA season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2537369 |title=ESPN \u2013 NBA announces postseason seeding format change \u2013 NBA |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=2006-08-02 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 2005, NBA division champions were seeded higher than the other teams in their conference, regardless of their record. Prior to 2004, when the NBA was aligned into two conferences with two divisions each, the division champions were guaranteed the top two seeds. This meant that top two teams in a conference (by record) would be seeded either first and second (if they were in opposite divisions) or first and third (if they were in the same division). Because of the NBA playoffs' preset matchups in the second round, this meant that the top two teams in a conference could never meet until the conference finals, assuming they both made it to that round.\n\nAfter the NBA realigned its two conferences into three divisions each, the seeding rules remained largely unchanged. The top three seeds would now be reserved for division champions. However, this meant that if the top two teams (by record) in a conference were in the same division, they would be seeded first and fourth. Assuming no first-round upsets, this raised the prospect that the top two teams in the conference would face each other in the conference semifinals, instead of the conference finals.\n\nIn the second year of this format, the 2005\u201306 NBA season, the two teams with the best records in the Western Conference, the [[San Antonio Spurs]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] of the [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]], did just that. The Mavericks had the second-best record in the Western Conference and the third-best record in the entire league, behind the [[Detroit Pistons]] and San Antonio. However, they were seeded fourth because they finished second in the Southwest behind the Spurs. This turn of events led to the playoff format being criticized by many. Besides the prospect of a team losing earlier in the playoffs than its regular-season record or seeding would suggest, critics claimed that it also created an unfair advantage for teams in the 2-7/3-6 half of the Western Conference playoff bracket, who could advance to the conference finals without playing either of the two best teams in the conference in an earlier round.\n\nThe [[Phoenix Suns]], winners of the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]] and possessors of the third best record, were seeded second, while the [[Denver Nuggets]], winners of the [[Northwest Division (NBA)|Northwest Division]] and tied for only the seventh-best record in the conference, were seeded third.\n\nThe [[Memphis Grizzlies]] and [[Los Angeles Clippers]] met in the second-to-last game of the regular season, after the top four seeds had been clinched. The two teams were already determined to be the fifth and sixth seeds, respectively, and had only to determine which rank higher. The fifth seed would likely need to defeat the best two teams in the conference without home-court advantage to advance to the conference finals, as it would face fourth-seeded Dallas in the first round and likely face first-seeded San Antonio if it managed to defeat Dallas. The sixth seed would play third-seeded Denver in the first round, but would have home-court advantage (since the Grizzlies had the fourth-best record in the conference and the Clippers had the fifth-best), and would not have to face either San Antonio or Dallas until the conference finals at the earliest.\n\nThis led to speculation about whether the Grizzlies or the Clippers would have much commitment to winning their match-up in the second-to-last game of the season, since it was clearly most advantageous to lose the game in order to obtain the 6th seed. The Clippers eventually lost to Memphis without much evidence to support the speculation that the Clippers had lost intentionally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=260418029 |title=No losers here?

Ultimately, Dallas and San Antonio did meet in the second round, with Dallas winning in seven games and advancing all the way to the NBA finals.\n\n===Timeline===\n* [[1947 NBA Playoffs|1947]]: The playoffs were instituted with a three-stage tournament, similar to the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] of the 1930s; the two first-place teams qualified directly to one semifinal where they played each other in a best-of-7 series.  Teams finishing second & third qualified for the best-of-3 quarterfinals, where the two second-placed teams were paired in one quarterfinal, as were the two third-placed teams, and the two quarterfinal winners played each other in a best-of-three semifinal.

The top eight teams in each conference ([[Eastern Conference (NBA)|East]] and [[Western Conference (NBA)|West]]), ranked in order by win-loss records, qualify for the playoffs. The tie-break criteria for playoff seeding and home-court advantage have also changed; head-to-head results between the tied teams is the first tie-breaker, and whether a team won its division championship is the second tie-breaker.<ref name=\"NBA20150908\">{{cite press release|title=NBA to seed conference playoff teams by record|url=http://www.nba.com/2015/news/09/08/nba-to-seed-conference-playoff-teams-by-record/index.html|publisher=National Basketball Association|date=September 8, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBoth conferences conduct the playoffs in the traditional bracket format. All rounds are [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] series. Series are played in the 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage hosts games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while their opponent hosts games 3, 4, and 6, with games 5\u20137 being played if needed. This format has been used since [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2014]], after NBA team owners unanimously voted to change the format of the NBA finals from the 2\u20133\u20132 format on October 23, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/10/23/nba-board-of-governors-format-change.ap/ |title=NBA owners change Finals format to 2-2-1-1-1 |publisher=NBA.com |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n\nThe most common criticism of the current structure is related to parity of conferences. On numerous occasions, [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] teams with losing records qualified for the playoffs, while [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] teams with winning records ended up missing them, including the [[2011 NBA playoffs|2011]], [[2013 NBA playoffs|2013]] and the [[2015 NBA playoffs]]. Weaker Eastern Conference teams also often make it farther in the playoffs due to the conference imbalance.\n\n==History==\nThe National Basketball Association was established in 1949 by merger of the [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA) and [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] but it recognizes the three BAA seasons as part of its own history. In all of its three years the BAA champion was finally determined in a best-of-seven series but its first two tournaments, the [[1947 BAA Playoffs|1947]] and [[1948 BAA Playoffs]], were otherwise quite different from the third, which 21st-century NBA playoffs nearly match. In 1947 and 1948, the Eastern and Western Division champions were matched in a [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] series following the regular season, whose winner advanced to the championship round. Meanwhile, four runners-up played best-of-three series to determine the other finalist: the two second-place teams were matched in one short series and the two third-place teams in another; the winners of those two series played another one. In 1947 the [[Philadelphia Warriors]] won the runners-up bracket and beat the Western champion [[Chicago Stags]] four games to one, which the NBA recognizes as its first championship; in 1948 Baltimore won the runners-up and beat Eastern champion Philadelphia in the final. Both tournaments generated one finalist from the Eastern and one from the Western Division, but only by chance.<ref name=BBR>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/BAA_1947.html \"1946\u201347 BAA Season Summary\"]. <br>&nbsp; [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/BAA_1948.html \"1947\u201348 BAA Season Summary\"].

At the same time, the number of playoff teams was increased from three to four from each Division; two rounds of best-of-three series were played, followed by a best-of-seven championship. The main idea was retained by the NBA. Even the [[1950 NBA Playoffs|1950 tournament]], following a transitional season with three divisions rather than two, initially determined one playoff champion from each division. The Central champion [[Minneapolis Lakers]] became the first league champion under the NBA name by defeating Anderson from the West in a best-of-three, with Syracuse from the East idle, and then knocking off the [[Syracuse Nationals]] in six games.<ref name=BBR2>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/BAA_1949.html \"1948\u201349 BAA Season Summary\"]. <br>&nbsp; [https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1950.html \"1949\u201350 NBA Season Summary\"]. Basketball-Reference.com. Retrieved 2015-03-01.</ref>\n\nThe 1951 through 1953 playoffs changed the division finals into a [[best-of-five playoff]]. With only nine league members in 1953\u201354, the NBA cut its postseason tournament field from eight teams to six (from 1954 through 1966, the period of eight to nine league members). [[Round-robin tournament|Round robins]] were played in 1954, uniquely in NBA history\u2014a three-team round robin among the three playoff teams in each division. From 1955 to 1966, the first-place team in each division was idle while its two runners-up faced played a best-of-three. Division finals were expanded to best-of-seven in 1958 and division semifinals to best-of-five in 1961.\n\nWith ten league members again for the 1966\u201367 season, eight teams were again admitted to the tournament, providing a simple three-round knockout (8-team bracket). A year later, the division semifinals were changed to best-of-seven playoff.  Then, in 1975 and 1977, respectively, a fifth and sixth team were added to each Division, necessitating an additional first round of best-of-three series.\n\nFinally in 1984, the tournament expanded to its present 16-team, four-round knockout, and the now-complete set of first-round series were expanded to a best-of-five. In 2003 the first round was changed to also be best-of-seven.\n\nBeginning with the 2004 season, with the addition of the thirtieth NBA franchise, the [[Charlotte Bobcats]], the NBA realigned its divisions. The result was that each conference would have three divisions of five teams each, and the winner of each division was guaranteed a top-three playoff seed. This would change slightly after the 2005\u201306 season; while division winners still receive automatic playoff berths, they are guaranteed a top-''four'' seed, as described below.\n\n===2006 NBA playoffs controversy===\nThe previous playoff format, in place for the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 NBA playoffs, after the NBA was re-aligned into six divisions, created controversy during the 2005\u201306 season and playoffs and would be changed prior to the 2006\u201307 NBA season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2537369 |title=ESPN \u2013 NBA announces postseason seeding format change \u2013 NBA |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=2006-08-02 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 2005, NBA division champions were seeded higher than the other teams in their conference, regardless of their record. Prior to 2004, when the NBA was aligned into two conferences with two divisions each, the division champions were guaranteed the top two seeds. This meant that top two teams in a conference (by record) would be seeded either first and second (if they were in opposite divisions) or first and third (if they were in the same division). Because of the NBA playoffs' preset matchups in the second round, this meant that the top two teams in a conference could never meet until the conference finals, assuming they both made it to that round.\n\nAfter the NBA realigned its two conferences into three divisions each, the seeding rules remained largely unchanged. The top three seeds would now be reserved for division champions. However, this meant that if the top two teams (by record) in a conference were in the same division, they would be seeded first and fourth. Assuming no first-round upsets, this raised the prospect that the top two teams in the conference would face each other in the conference semifinals, instead of the conference finals.\n\nIn the second year of this format, the 2005\u201306 NBA season, the two teams with the best records in the Western Conference, the [[San Antonio Spurs]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] of the [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]], did just that. The Mavericks had the second-best record in the Western Conference and the third-best record in the entire league, behind the [[Detroit Pistons]] and San Antonio. However, they were seeded fourth because they finished second in the Southwest behind the Spurs. This turn of events led to the playoff format being criticized by many. Besides the prospect of a team losing earlier in the playoffs than its regular-season record or seeding would suggest, critics claimed that it also created an unfair advantage for teams in the 2-7/3-6 half of the Western Conference playoff bracket, who could advance to the conference finals without playing either of the two best teams in the conference in an earlier round.\n\nThe [[Phoenix Suns]], winners of the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]] and possessors of the third best record, were seeded second, while the [[Denver Nuggets]], winners of the [[Northwest Division (NBA)|Northwest Division]] and tied for only the seventh-best record in the conference, were seeded third.\n\nThe [[Memphis Grizzlies]] and [[Los Angeles Clippers]] met in the second-to-last game of the regular season, after the top four seeds had been clinched. The two teams were already determined to be the fifth and sixth seeds, respectively, and had only to determine which rank higher. The fifth seed would likely need to defeat the best two teams in the conference without home-court advantage to advance to the conference finals, as it would face fourth-seeded Dallas in the first round and likely face first-seeded San Antonio if it managed to defeat Dallas. The sixth seed would play third-seeded Denver in the first round, but would have home-court advantage (since the Grizzlies had the fourth-best record in the conference and the Clippers had the fifth-best), and would not have to face either San Antonio or Dallas until the conference finals at the earliest.\n\nThis led to speculation about whether the Grizzlies or the Clippers would have much commitment to winning their match-up in the second-to-last game of the season, since it was clearly most advantageous to lose the game in order to obtain the 6th seed. The Clippers eventually lost to Memphis without much evidence to support the speculation that the Clippers had lost intentionally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=260418029 |title=No losers here?

Ultimately, Dallas and San Antonio did meet in the second round, with Dallas winning in seven games and advancing all the way to the NBA finals.\n\n===Timeline===\n* [[1947 NBA Playoffs|1947]]: The playoffs were instituted with a three-stage tournament, similar to the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]] of the 1930s; the two first-place teams qualified directly to one semifinal where they played each other in a best-of-7 series.  Teams finishing second & third qualified for the best-of-3 quarterfinals, where the two second-placed teams were paired in one quarterfinal, as were the two third-placed teams, and the two quarterfinal winners played each other in a best-of-three semifinal.  The two semifinal winners played each other in the Basketball Association of America (BAA) best-of-7 final series.\n{{3RoundBracket-Byes | RD1= Quarterfinals<br>Best-of-3\n| RD2= Semifinals<br>Best-of-3 (one series)\nBest-of-7 (one series)\n| RD3= BAA finals<br>Best-of-7\n| RD1-seed1=E3\n| RD1-team1=&nbsp;\n| RD1-score1=\n| RD1-seed2=W3\n| RD1-team2=&nbsp;\n| RD1-score2=\n| RD1-seed3=W2\n| RD1-team3=&nbsp;\n| RD1-score3=\n| RD1-seed4=E2\n| RD1-team4=&nbsp;\n| RD1-score4=\n| RD2-seed1=E3\n| RD2-team1=&nbsp;\n| RD2-score1=\n| RD2-seed2=E2\n| RD2-team2=&nbsp;\n| RD2-score2=\n| RD2-seed3=W1\n| RD2-team3=&nbsp;\n| RD2-score3=\n| RD2-seed4=E1\n| RD2-team4=&nbsp;\n| RD2-score4=\n| RD3-seed1=E2\n| RD3-team1=&nbsp;\n| RD3-score1=\n| RD3-seed2=W1\n| RD3-team2=&nbsp;\n| RD3-score2=\n}}\nThere were no [[Bye (sports)|bye]]s, or idle time, for the division champions \u2013 as there would be for higher-seeded playoff teams 1955\u201366 and 1975\u201383. All six 1947 participants played their first tournament games on Wednesday, April 2; in 1948 the two Eastern runners-up (E2, E3 in the figure) were idle for a few days only because there was a three-way Western tie to break. Both winners of the runners-up bracket, Philadelphia in 1947 and Baltimore in 1948, reached the final series having played fewer tournament games than their final opponents, Chicago in 1947 and Philadelphia in 1948, had played in the best-of-7 pairings of division champions. And both winners of the runners-up bracket won the final series. The \"postseason\" actually comprised 11 games played in a span of 21 days for the 1947 Chicago Stags and 13 games in 30 days for 1948 Philadelphia Warriors, the finalists who emerged from the pairing of division champions.<ref name=BBR/>\n\n* [[1949 NBA Playoffs|1949]]: The playoffs were reorganized to match Eastern Division teams exclusively, and Western Division teams exclusively \u2013 in two halves of the bracket, so to speak. Thus the BAA tournament generated a playoff champion in each Division. (So did the NBA in each of three 1950 divisions, and so it has done in each half of the league since then.)<!--evidently under discussion for 2016--> The top four teams from each of the two divisions qualified.  The quarterfinals and semifinals were renamed division semifinals and division finals, respectively, and both rounds were best-of-3. Thus any playoff team might be eliminated in two games, one home game.
