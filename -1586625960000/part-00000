It was written by [[Ivan Matias]], [[Andrea Martin (musician)|Andrea Martin]], Marqueze Etheridge and produced by [[Organized Noize]] for the [[Set It Off (soundtrack)|''Set It Off'' soundtrack]] (1996), also appearing on the group's third album, ''[[EV3]]'' (1997). The song was the band's last single to feature former band member [[Dawn Robinson]] and was En Vogue's biggest international single, making it to number 10 on several countries. According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', the single ranked as the 83rd most successful single of the 1990s.\nThe song compelled Elektra mogul Sylvia Rhone to place En Vogue back in the studio to record their EV3 for release in 1997. However, Dawn Robinson felt a solo career was not feasible while she was still a member of En Vogue, while the other group members plus the record producers and label executives were focused on the new En Vogue album. Forced to choose, Robinson decided to leave En Vogue for a solo career with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Records. The turn of events following the success of \"Don't Let Go (Love)\" was the beginning of a long and tumultuous era for En Vogue as member changes became quite frequent. In 2011, ''[[NME]]'' ranked the song at number 127 in their list of the \"150 Best Tracks Of The Past 15 Years\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/list/150-best-tracks-of-the-past-15-years-1257|title=150 Best Tracks Of The Past 15 Years|work=[[NME]]|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\"Don't Let Go (Love)\" was written by [[Andrea Martin (musician)|Andrea Martin]], [[Ivan Matias]], Marqueze Ethridge, and [[Organized Noize]] members [[Sleepy Brown]], Rico Wade, and Ray Murray, while production was by Organized Noize.<ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite AV media notes |title=EV3 |publisher=[[Elektra Records]] |others=[[En Vogue]] |titlelink=EV3 |year=1997}}</ref> Vocal production was supervised by Matias.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> [[Dawn Robinson]] sings the entire lead while [[Maxine Jones]] performs the bridge.

It reached #5 in the UK in early 1997 and spent 13 weeks in the UK top 40, eight of them in the top 10. The single re-entered the UK chart at number 23 in 2011 after the girl group [[Little Mix]] performed the song on the eighth series of the British television singing competition, ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'', on November 19, 2011. The En Vogue track reached #23 on the UK chart and also returned to the Irish charts at #50. In 1997, \"Don't Let Go (Love)\" went to #1 on the Norwegian top 20 singles chart (VG-Lista Topp 20) and stayed there for six consecutive weeks.

It was written by [[Ivan Matias]], [[Andrea Martin (musician)|Andrea Martin]], Marqueze Etheridge and produced by [[Organized Noize]] for the [[Set It Off (soundtrack)|''Set It Off'' soundtrack]] (1996), also appearing on the group's third album, ''[[EV3]]'' (1997). The song was the band's last single to feature former band member [[Dawn Robinson]] and was En Vogue's biggest international single, making it to number 10 on several countries. According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', the single ranked as the 83rd most successful single of the 1990s.\nThe song compelled Elektra mogul Sylvia Rhone to place En Vogue back in the studio to record their EV3 for release in 1997. However, Dawn Robinson felt a solo career was not feasible while she was still a member of En Vogue, while the other group members plus the record producers and label executives were focused on the new En Vogue album. Forced to choose, Robinson decided to leave En Vogue for a solo career with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Records. The turn of events following the success of \"Don't Let Go (Love)\" was the beginning of a long and tumultuous era for En Vogue as member changes became quite frequent. In 2011, ''[[NME]]'' ranked the song at number 127 in their list of the \"150 Best Tracks Of The Past 15 Years\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/list/150-best-tracks-of-the-past-15-years-1257|title=150 Best Tracks Of The Past 15 Years|work=[[NME]]|date=6 October 2011|accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\"Don't Let Go (Love)\" was written by [[Andrea Martin (musician)|Andrea Martin]], [[Ivan Matias]], Marqueze Ethridge, and [[Organized Noize]] members [[Sleepy Brown]], Rico Wade, and Ray Murray, while production was by Organized Noize.<ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite AV media notes |title=EV3 |publisher=[[Elektra Records]] |others=[[En Vogue]] |titlelink=EV3 |year=1997}}</ref> Vocal production was supervised by Matias.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> [[Dawn Robinson]] sings the entire lead while [[Maxine Jones]] performs the bridge.

He was also founder and managing director of ''Achieving'', a quality assurance consultancy.\n\nHe was convener of the [[Scottish Parliament]]'s Transport and Environment [[Scottish Parliament#Committees|Committee]] and served on the [[Confederation of British Industry]] working group designed to bring [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) and business closer together as well as being on the cross-party group on ageing and the elderly.\n\nKerr is considered to be an ally of [[Motherwell and Wishaw (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Motherwell and Wishaw]] MSP [[Jack McConnell]], working with him on his two successive bids for the leadership of Scottish Labour and the position of First Minister.\n\nKerr was first appointed [[List of Scottish Executive Ministerial Teams|Minister for Finance and Public Services]] in the [[Scottish Executive]] in November 2001 and moved to become Minister for Health and Community Care in October 2004, replacing [[Malcolm Chisolm]]. As Health Minister, Kerr oversaw significant NHS restructuring.\n\nHe was also responsible for the Scottish ban on  [[smoking ban in public places]] which was introduced on 26 March 2006. In November 2006, he won the [[Scottish Politician of the Year]] award in recognition of his work to bring in the smoking ban.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6156548.stm Deportation campaign wins award], ''[[BBC News]]'', 17 November 2006</ref> Kerr retained the health portfolio in McConnell's shadow cabinet upon the [[Scottish National Party]]'s victory at the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 election]].\n\nHaving ruled himself out of contention as a successor for Jack McConnell, Kerr voted for Wendy Alexander to become leader of the Scottish Labour Party. On 17 September 2007 he was appointed Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Public Services and Local Government. With [[Wendy Alexander]]'s resignation as leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, Kerr stood for election as the next leader. However, following the victory of Iain Gray in the leadership election, Kerr was appointed Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth.\n\nAt the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Kerr was one of many Labour casualties, losing his seat after 12 years to [[Linda Fabiani]] of the SNP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-13305003|title=Labour 'class of '99' lose to SNP|date=6 May 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Kerr did not stand on the regional list, so therefore did not return as an MSP.\n\nKerr lives in [[Strathaven]] with his wife and three daughters.\n\nOn 11 July 2011, it was announced that Andy had been appointed to the vacant CEO position at Scottish Charity Organisation, [[Sense Scotland]].<ref>http://www.sensescotland.org.uk/news/new-ceo-announcement.php{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nDuring the 2018 [[Labour Party Conference]] Kerr faced accusations of [[sectarianism]] after calling a woman to the stage to speak and appeared to mock the woman saying  \"Did you cross yourself, there? In that case, I might not [call you].\" The reference was to making the [[sign of the cross]], an act common among [[Roman Catholics]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/andy-kerr-should-drop-nec-role-after-anti-catholic-remark-say-snp-250825|title=Scotsman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-45627895/labour-official-andy-kerr-sorry-for-catholic-jibe|title=BBC news|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\nThe comment was condemned by the Scottish First Minister, [[Nicola Sturgeon]] who called for his resignation as head of the [[National Executive Committee|National Excutive Committee]].

1962, [[East Kilbride]], [[South Lanarkshire]]) is a Scottish [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] politician and former [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] for [[East Kilbride (Scottish Parliament constituency)|East Kilbride constituency]], a seat which he held from 1999 until 2011.\n\n==Biography==\nKerr was educated at [[Claremont High School (East Kilbride)|Claremont High School]] in [[East Kilbride]] and obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[Social Sciences]] at [[Glasgow Caledonian University]].\n\nPrior to being elected to the [[Scottish Parliament]], he was a senior officer in [[Glasgow City Council]] land services department and served as an adviser in the Leader's office. He was also founder and managing director of ''Achieving'', a quality assurance consultancy.\n\nHe was convener of the [[Scottish Parliament]]'s Transport and Environment [[Scottish Parliament#Committees|Committee]] and served on the [[Confederation of British Industry]] working group designed to bring [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) and business closer together as well as being on the cross-party group on ageing and the elderly.\n\nKerr is considered to be an ally of [[Motherwell and Wishaw (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Motherwell and Wishaw]] MSP [[Jack McConnell]], working with him on his two successive bids for the leadership of Scottish Labour and the position of First Minister.\n\nKerr was first appointed [[List of Scottish Executive Ministerial Teams|Minister for Finance and Public Services]] in the [[Scottish Executive]] in November 2001 and moved to become Minister for Health and Community Care in October 2004, replacing [[Malcolm Chisolm]]. As Health Minister, Kerr oversaw significant NHS restructuring.\n\nHe was also responsible for the Scottish ban on  [[smoking ban in public places]] which was introduced on 26 March 2006. In November 2006, he won the [[Scottish Politician of the Year]] award in recognition of his work to bring in the smoking ban.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6156548.stm Deportation campaign wins award], ''[[BBC News]]'', 17 November 2006</ref> Kerr retained the health portfolio in McConnell's shadow cabinet upon the [[Scottish National Party]]'s victory at the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 election]].\n\nHaving ruled himself out of contention as a successor for Jack McConnell, Kerr voted for Wendy Alexander to become leader of the Scottish Labour Party. On 17 September 2007 he was appointed Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Public Services and Local Government. With [[Wendy Alexander]]'s resignation as leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, Kerr stood for election as the next leader. However, following the victory of Iain Gray in the leadership election, Kerr was appointed Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth.\n\nAt the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Kerr was one of many Labour casualties, losing his seat after 12 years to [[Linda Fabiani]] of the SNP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-13305003|title=Labour 'class of '99' lose to SNP|date=6 May 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Kerr did not stand on the regional list, so therefore did not return as an MSP.\n\nKerr lives in [[Strathaven]] with his wife and three daughters.\n\nOn 11 July 2011, it was announced that Andy had been appointed to the vacant CEO position at Scottish Charity Organisation, [[Sense Scotland]].<ref>http://www.sensescotland.org.uk/news/new-ceo-announcement.php{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nDuring the 2018 [[Labour Party Conference]] Kerr faced accusations of [[sectarianism]] after calling a woman to the stage to speak and appeared to mock the woman saying  \"Did you cross yourself, there? In that case, I might not [call you].\" The reference was to making the [[sign of the cross]], an act common among [[Roman Catholics]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/andy-kerr-should-drop-nec-role-after-anti-catholic-remark-say-snp-250825|title=Scotsman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-45627895/labour-official-andy-kerr-sorry-for-catholic-jibe|title=BBC news|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\nThe comment was condemned by the Scottish First Minister, [[Nicola Sturgeon]] who called for his resignation as head of the [[National Executive Committee|National Excutive Committee]].

His [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) playing career spanned from 1986 to 2001 while playing for the [[Oakland Athletics]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], winning one [[World Series]] championship each with Oakland as a player in [[1989 World Series|1989]] and with St. Louis as a coach in [[2011 World Series|2011]].  One of the most prolific [[home run]] hitters in baseball history, McGwire holds the major league career record for [[at bats per home run]] ratio (10.6), and is the former record holder for both [[List of Major League Baseball progressive single-season home run leaders|home runs in a single season]] (70 in 1998) and home runs hit by rookie (49 in 1987).  \n\nHe ranks 11th all time in [[home run]]s with 583, and led the major leagues in home runs in five different seasons, while establishing the major league record for home runs hit in a four-season period from 1996 to 1999 with 245.  Further, he demonstrated exemplary patience as a batter, producing a career .394 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP) and twice leading the major leagues in [[bases on balls]].  Injuries cut short the manifestation of even greater potential as he reached 140 games played in just eight of 16 total seasons.  A right-handed batter and thrower, McGwire stood {{convert|6|ft|5|in|m}} tall and weighed {{convert|245|lb}} during his playing career.\n\nA part of the [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase]] of [[Roger Maris]]' 61 with the Cardinals, McGwire set the [[Major League Baseball single-season home run record|major league single-season home run record]] with 70,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_progress.shtml |title=Progressive Leaders & Records for Home Runs |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> which [[Barry Bonds]] broke three years later with 73.<ref name=Bonds-testified>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1937594 |title=\"Bonds testified that substances didn't work\", ESPN.com, December 4, 2004, accessed 02/03/11 |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=December 4, 2004 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  McGwire also led the league in [[runs batted in]], twice in [[bases on balls]] and [[on-base percentage]], and four times in [[slugging percentage]].

He hit just four in the month of April, but followed in May with 15, and another nine in June. Before the All-Star break arrived, he totaled 33 HR and earned a spot on the [[American League]] (AL) [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star team]].

With 49 HR and two games remaining in the regular season, he chose to sit them out with an opportunity for 50 home runs to be present for the birth of his first child.

In later years, his mobility decreased and, with it, his defense; however, McGwire's batting averages after his rookie season plummeted to .260, .231, and .235 from 1988 to 1990. In 1991, he bottomed out with a .201 average and 22 homers. [[List of Oakland Athletics managers|Manager]] [[Tony La Russa]] sat him out the final game of the [[1991 Oakland Athletics season|season]] to avoid allowing his batting average to dip below .200. Despite the declining averages during this time of his career, his high [[bases on balls]] totals allowed him to maintain acceptable OBPs. In fact, when he hit .201, his OPS+ was 103, or just over league average.\n\nMcGwire stated in an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that 1991 was the \"worst year\" of his life, with his on-field performance and marriage difficulties, and that he \"didn't lift a weight\" that entire season. With all that behind him, McGwire re-dedicated himself to working out harder than ever and received visual therapy from a sports vision specialist.<ref>[http://www.sdccd.edu/events/we/wepdf/we-sp99.pdf] https://web.archive.org/web/20150701040841/http://www.sdccd.edu/events/we/wepdf/we-sp99.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/features/mcgwire/flashbacks/060192/ |work=CNN |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |title=Oakland's Mark McGwire is smiling again, now that he's hitting homers at a record pace |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104193550/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/features/mcgwire/flashbacks/060192/ |archivedate=November 4, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n====Career resurgence (1992\u201397)====\n\nThe \"new look\" McGwire hit 42 homers and batted .268 in 1992, with an outstanding OPS+ of 175 (the highest of his career to that point), and put on a home run hitting show at the [[Home Run Derby]] during the [[1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1992 All-Star break]]. His performance propelled the [[1992 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] to the American League West Division title in 1992, their fourth in five seasons. The A's lost in the [[1992 American League Championship Series|playoffs]] to the eventual [[1992 World Series|World Series]] champion, the [[1992 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]].\n\nFoot injuries limited McGwire to a total of 74 games in [[1993 Oakland Athletics season|1993]] and [[1994 Oakland Athletics season|1994]], and just 9 home runs in each of the two seasons. He played just 104 games in [[1995 Oakland Athletics season|1995]], but his proportional totals were much improved: 39 home runs in 317 at-bats. In [[1996 Oakland Athletics season|1996]], McGwire belted a major league leading 52 homers in 423 at-bats. He also hit a career high .312 average, and led the league in both slugging percentage and on-base percentage.\n\nMcGwire's total of 363 home runs with the Athletics surpassed the previous franchise record. He was selected or voted to nine [[American League]] All-Star Teams while playing for the A's, including six consecutive appearances from [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1987]] through [[1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1992]]. He was one of only four players to hit a ball over the roof in the left field of [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]].<ref>The Final Season, p.90, Tom Stanton, Thomas Dunne Books, An imprint of St. Martin's Press, New York, 2001, {{ISBN|0-312-29156-6}}</ref>\n\n===St. Louis Cardinals (1997\u20132001)===\n\n[[File:Mark mcgwire.jpg|thumb|right|McGwire hitting a home run in St. Louis against the Tigers on July 14, 2001]]\nOn July 31, having already amassed 34 home runs to this point in the [[1997 in baseball|1997 season]], McGwire was traded from the [[1997 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] to the [[1997 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] for [[T.

In 51 games with the Cardinals to finish the 1997 season, McGwire compiled a .253 batting average, 24 home runs, and 42 RBI. Overall in 1997, McGwire led the majors with 58 home runs. He also finished third in the major leagues in slugging percentage (.646), fourth in OPS (1.039), fifth in OPS+ (170), tenth in RBI (123), and ninth in walks (101). He placed 16th in the NL MVP voting.\n\nIt was the last year of his contract, so there was speculation that McGwire would play for the Cardinals only for the remainder of the season, then seek a long-term deal, possibly in Southern California, where he still lived; however, McGwire signed a contract to stay in St. Louis. It is also believed that McGwire later encouraged [[Jim Edmonds]], another Southern California resident who was traded to St. Louis, to forgo free agency and sign a contract with the Cardinals in 2000.\n\n====Single-season home run record chase (1998)====\n\nAs the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|1998 season]] progressed, it became clear that McGwire, [[1998 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] outfielder [[Ken Griffey Jr.]], and [[1998 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] outfielder [[Sammy Sosa]] were all on track to break [[Roger Maris]]'s single-season home run record. [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|The race to break the record]] first attracted media attention as the home run leader changed often throughout the season. On August 19, Sosa hit his 48th home run to move ahead of McGwire; however, later that day McGwire hit his 48th and 49th home runs to regain the lead.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn September 8, 1998, McGwire hit a pitch by the Cubs' [[Steve Trachsel]] over the left field wall for his record-breaking 62nd home run, setting off massive celebrations at [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]]. The fact that the game was against the Cubs meant that Sosa was able to congratulate McGwire personally on his achievement. Members of Maris's family were also present at the game. The ball was freely, albeit controversially, given to McGwire in a ceremony on the field by the stadium worker who found it.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nMcGwire finished the 1998 season with 70 home runs (including five in his last three games), four ahead of Sosa's 66, a record that was broken three seasons later in 2001 by [[Barry Bonds]] with 73.<ref name=Bonds-testified/>\n\nMcGwire was honored with the inaugural [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] for leading Major League Baseball in home runs.<ref name=harber>{{cite news|last=Harber|first=Paul|title=A statue fit for a home run king|date=July 22, 2001|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8659756.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602104753/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8659756.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 2, 2013|accessdate=November 8, 2011|quote=The first award was given to Mark McGwire after his 70-home-run season in 1998.}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Although McGwire had the prestige of the home run record, Sammy Sosa (who had fewer HR but more RBI and stolen bases) won the 1998 NL MVP award, as his contributions helped propel the Cubs to the [[1998 National League Division Series|playoffs]] (the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] in 1998 finished third in the NL Central).

For the fourth consecutive season, he led MLB in home runs with 65. It was also his fourth consecutive season with at least 50 home runs, extending his own major league record. Sosa, who hit 63 home runs in 1999, again trailed McGwire. Thus, they became the first, and still only, players in major league history to hit 60 or more home runs in consecutive seasons. McGwire also set a record from 1998 to 1999 for home runs in a two-season period with 135. Further, he owned the highest four-season HR total, with 245 from 1996 to 1999. In 1999, he drove in an NL-leading 147 runs while only having 145 hits, the highest RBI-per-hit tally for a season in baseball history.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nStatistically in 2000 and 2001, McGwire's numbers declined relative to previous years as he struggled to avoid injury (32 HR in 89 games, and 29 HR in 97 games, respectively).

baseball]] [[first baseman]]. His [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) playing career spanned from 1986 to 2001 while playing for the [[Oakland Athletics]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], winning one [[World Series]] championship each with Oakland as a player in [[1989 World Series|1989]] and with St. Louis as a coach in [[2011 World Series|2011]].  One of the most prolific [[home run]] hitters in baseball history, McGwire holds the major league career record for [[at bats per home run]] ratio (10.6), and is the former record holder for both [[List of Major League Baseball progressive single-season home run leaders|home runs in a single season]] (70 in 1998) and home runs hit by rookie (49 in 1987).  \n\nHe ranks 11th all time in [[home run]]s with 583, and led the major leagues in home runs in five different seasons, while establishing the major league record for home runs hit in a four-season period from 1996 to 1999 with 245.  Further, he demonstrated exemplary patience as a batter, producing a career .394 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP) and twice leading the major leagues in [[bases on balls]].  Injuries cut short the manifestation of even greater potential as he reached 140 games played in just eight of 16 total seasons.  A right-handed batter and thrower, McGwire stood {{convert|6|ft|5|in|m}} tall and weighed {{convert|245|lb}} during his playing career.\n\nA part of the [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase]] of [[Roger Maris]]' 61 with the Cardinals, McGwire set the [[Major League Baseball single-season home run record|major league single-season home run record]] with 70,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_progress.shtml |title=Progressive Leaders & Records for Home Runs |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> which [[Barry Bonds]] broke three years later with 73.<ref name=Bonds-testified>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1937594 |title=\"Bonds testified that substances didn't work\", ESPN.com, December 4, 2004, accessed 02/03/11 |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=December 4, 2004 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>  McGwire also led the league in [[runs batted in]], twice in [[bases on balls]] and [[on-base percentage]], and four times in [[slugging percentage]].

He hit just four in the month of April, but followed in May with 15, and another nine in June. Before the All-Star break arrived, he totaled 33 HR and earned a spot on the [[American League]] (AL) [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star team]]. On August 11, he broke [[Al Rosen]]'s AL rookie record of 37 home runs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/APAB/lib00581,122CA98E1CEF7498.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708140841/http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/APAB/lib00581,122CA98E1CEF7498.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 8, 2012|date=August 10, 2008}}</ref>  Three days later, McGwire broke the major league record of 38, which [[Frank Robinson]] and [[Wally Berger]] jointly held. In September, McGwire hit nine more home runs while posting monthly personal bests of a .351 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], .419 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP) and 11 [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] (2B). With 49 HR and two games remaining in the regular season, he chose to sit them out with an opportunity for 50 home runs to be present for the birth of his first child. McGwire also totaled 118 [[runs batted in]] (RBI), .289 batting average, 97 [[Run (baseball)|runs]] scored, 28 doubles, a .618 [[slugging percentage]] and a .370 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP).

He was generally regarded as a good fielder in his early years, even winning a [[Gold Glove Award]] in [[1990 Major League Baseball season|1990]] \u2013 the only one that [[New York Yankees]] legend [[Don Mattingly]] would not win between [[1985 Major League Baseball season|1985]] and [[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994]]. In later years, his mobility decreased and, with it, his defense; however, McGwire's batting averages after his rookie season plummeted to .260, .231, and .235 from 1988 to 1990. In 1991, he bottomed out with a .201 average and 22 homers. [[List of Oakland Athletics managers|Manager]] [[Tony La Russa]] sat him out the final game of the [[1991 Oakland Athletics season|season]] to avoid allowing his batting average to dip below .200. Despite the declining averages during this time of his career, his high [[bases on balls]] totals allowed him to maintain acceptable OBPs. In fact, when he hit .201, his OPS+ was 103, or just over league average.\n\nMcGwire stated in an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that 1991 was the \"worst year\" of his life, with his on-field performance and marriage difficulties, and that he \"didn't lift a weight\" that entire season.

His performance propelled the [[1992 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] to the American League West Division title in 1992, their fourth in five seasons. The A's lost in the [[1992 American League Championship Series|playoffs]] to the eventual [[1992 World Series|World Series]] champion, the [[1992 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]].\n\nFoot injuries limited McGwire to a total of 74 games in [[1993 Oakland Athletics season|1993]] and [[1994 Oakland Athletics season|1994]], and just 9 home runs in each of the two seasons. He played just 104 games in [[1995 Oakland Athletics season|1995]], but his proportional totals were much improved: 39 home runs in 317 at-bats. In [[1996 Oakland Athletics season|1996]], McGwire belted a major league leading 52 homers in 423 at-bats. He also hit a career high .312 average, and led the league in both slugging percentage and on-base percentage.\n\nMcGwire's total of 363 home runs with the Athletics surpassed the previous franchise record. He was selected or voted to nine [[American League]] All-Star Teams while playing for the A's, including six consecutive appearances from [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1987]] through [[1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1992]]. He was one of only four players to hit a ball over the roof in the left field of [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]].<ref>The Final Season, p.90, Tom Stanton, Thomas Dunne Books, An imprint of St. Martin's Press, New York, 2001, {{ISBN|0-312-29156-6}}</ref>\n\n===St. Louis Cardinals (1997\u20132001)===\n\n[[File:Mark mcgwire.jpg|thumb|right|McGwire hitting a home run in St. Louis against the Tigers on July 14, 2001]]\nOn July 31, having already amassed 34 home runs to this point in the [[1997 in baseball|1997 season]], McGwire was traded from the [[1997 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] to the [[1997 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] for [[T.

In 51 games with the Cardinals to finish the 1997 season, McGwire compiled a .253 batting average, 24 home runs, and 42 RBI. Overall in 1997, McGwire led the majors with 58 home runs. He also finished third in the major leagues in slugging percentage (.646), fourth in OPS (1.039), fifth in OPS+ (170), tenth in RBI (123), and ninth in walks (101). He placed 16th in the NL MVP voting.\n\nIt was the last year of his contract, so there was speculation that McGwire would play for the Cardinals only for the remainder of the season, then seek a long-term deal, possibly in Southern California, where he still lived; however, McGwire signed a contract to stay in St. Louis. It is also believed that McGwire later encouraged [[Jim Edmonds]], another Southern California resident who was traded to St. Louis, to forgo free agency and sign a contract with the Cardinals in 2000.\n\n====Single-season home run record chase (1998)====\n\nAs the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|1998 season]] progressed, it became clear that McGwire, [[1998 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] outfielder [[Ken Griffey Jr.]], and [[1998 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] outfielder [[Sammy Sosa]] were all on track to break [[Roger Maris]]'s single-season home run record. [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|The race to break the record]] first attracted media attention as the home run leader changed often throughout the season. On August 19, Sosa hit his 48th home run to move ahead of McGwire; however, later that day McGwire hit his 48th and 49th home runs to regain the lead.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn September 8, 1998, McGwire hit a pitch by the Cubs' [[Steve Trachsel]] over the left field wall for his record-breaking 62nd home run, setting off massive celebrations at [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]]. The fact that the game was against the Cubs meant that Sosa was able to congratulate McGwire personally on his achievement. Members of Maris's family were also present at the game. The ball was freely, albeit controversially, given to McGwire in a ceremony on the field by the stadium worker who found it.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nMcGwire finished the 1998 season with 70 home runs (including five in his last three games), four ahead of Sosa's 66, a record that was broken three seasons later in 2001 by [[Barry Bonds]] with 73.<ref name=Bonds-testified/>\n\nMcGwire was honored with the inaugural [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] for leading Major League Baseball in home runs.<ref name=harber>{{cite news|last=Harber|first=Paul|title=A statue fit for a home run king|date=July 22, 2001|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8659756.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602104753/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8659756.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 2, 2013|accessdate=November 8, 2011|quote=The first award was given to Mark McGwire after his 70-home-run season in 1998.}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Although McGwire had the prestige of the home run record, Sammy Sosa (who had fewer HR but more RBI and stolen bases) won the 1998 NL MVP award, as his contributions helped propel the Cubs to the [[1998 National League Division Series|playoffs]] (the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] in 1998 finished third in the NL Central).

For the fourth consecutive season, he led MLB in home runs with 65. It was also his fourth consecutive season with at least 50 home runs, extending his own major league record. Sosa, who hit 63 home runs in 1999, again trailed McGwire. Thus, they became the first, and still only, players in major league history to hit 60 or more home runs in consecutive seasons. McGwire also set a record from 1998 to 1999 for home runs in a two-season period with 135. Further, he owned the highest four-season HR total, with 245 from 1996 to 1999. In 1999, he drove in an NL-leading 147 runs while only having 145 hits, the highest RBI-per-hit tally for a season in baseball history.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nStatistically in 2000 and 2001, McGwire's numbers declined relative to previous years as he struggled to avoid injury (32 HR in 89 games, and 29 HR in 97 games, respectively).

On the day of battle McDougall was assigned to guard the pack train, but the mules were not used to carrying packs and lagged far behind the other 3 detachments under Custer, Reno, and Benteen.

Col. [[George A. Custer]] were the main combat element of a larger column of soldiers, called the Dakota Column commanded by General [[Alfred Terry]].{{sfn|Donovan|2009|p=99,117,118,134. The column also had 3 companies of infantry, about 40 men, to protect supply bases; a detachment of 40 Arikara and 4 Sioux Indian Scouts; an artillery detachment of four guns with 34 men; and 150 supply wagons.}}\n\nThe Dakota Column was to meet with General John Gibbon's Montana Column at the mouth of the Powder River.  On reaching the Powder River General Terry learned from General John Gibbon that his scouts had located a large Sioux village that had been seen on lower Rosebud Creek.  General Terry believed that the village had gone up the Rosebud and then over western drainages, but he dispatched the Seventh's \"right wing\" under Major Reno to scout the Powder and the Tongue to ensure that the village had not turned back east.  The \"right wing\" consisted Companies I, E, L, F, and B Company led by \"easygoing Tom McDougall\".{{sfn|Donovan|2009|p=160-163}}  Deviating from General Terry's orders Major Reno shortened his inspection of the Powder River and the Tongue and went over to Reno Creek, where he confirmed a series of large fresh campsites from the Sioux village of some 400 plus lodges as it moved up Rosebud Creek.{{sfn|Donovan|2009|p=162-165}} This information led General Terry to concentrate his troops at the mouth of Rosebud Creek, and then on June 22, 1876 to dispatch Custer with the entire 7th Cavalry up the Rosebud in pursuit of the Sioux village.{{sfn|Donovan|2009|p=172-184}} On June 24, Custer learned from his Indian Scouts that the village had gone over the divide into the Little Horn Valley.{{sfn|Donovan|2009|p=200-206}}\n\n===Morning, June 25, assigned to take charge of the pack train===\n\nOn the early morning of the day of battle, June 25, 1876, Custer and the 7th Cavalry were on the divide between Rosebud Creek and the Little Bighorn River.  From this divide, the Crow scouts had discovered indications of a large Sioux and Cheyenne village in the Valley of the Little Bighorn River at about 14\u201316 air miles distance. Custer divided his command into 4 groups. Colonel Custer retained five troops (C, E, F, I, and L) and assigned Major Reno three troops (A,G, and M) and these two groups proceeded down a small tributary of the Little Big Horn River (present day Reno Creek, referred to by the Sioux in 1876 as Sundance Creek) toward the Indian village in the Little Big Horn valley. Captain Benteen was also assigned three troops(H, D, and K) and sent off on a lateral path to the southwest to see if there were other Indian villages in the valley to the south.\n\nCaptain McDougall and his Troop B was assigned to guard the pack train and they comprised the fourth group.  Lt. Edward G. Mathey was the officer assigned to be in charge of the pack train and its permanent personnel, but since it had critical supplies for the column, including the column's extra ammunition Custer ordered one troop to be detached to safeguard it. \"Captain McDougall had fallen asleep prior to officer's call and had been the last to report to Adjutant Cooke.  As a consequence, McDougall's B Company was assigned to guard Lieutenant Mathey's slow moving pack train.\"{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=151.}}  \"Some of his  [McDougal's] disappointed troopers, doubtful they would see any action, wept at this.\"{{sfn|Donovan|2009|p=210.}}\n\nAt the Reno Court of Inquiry in January 1879, McDougall testified that at about 11{{nbsp}}a.m. on June 25th, on the Divide between the Rosebud and the Little Big Horn, he was ordered by Custer to \"take charge of the pack train and serve as a rear guard\".<ref name=\"Reno Court of Inquiry\">{{cite web|title=Reno, Marcus A., Court of Inquiry, January 1879, The official record of a court of inquiry convened at Chicago, Illinois, January 13, 1879, by the President of the United States upon the request of Major Marcus A.

The remnants of Reno's command stopped on top of the bluffs and attempted to dig in.{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=168-180, 182\u2013187, 188\u2013205.}}\n\nCuster's five troops had approached the Indian camp by a different route than taken by Reno, which had not allowed Custer to view the valley or see the village.   Custer left his five troops and rode up to the edge of the high bluffs just east of the Little Bighorn Valley and was confronted by a view of a very large Indian village.{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=164. \"They rode on until they were approaching the ridgeline and suddenly they saw it: the flat and seemingly endless expanse of the Little Bighorn Valley...And there two miles to the northwest...was the largest Indian village any of them had ever seen: hundreds of gleaming white teepees beneath the soaring transparent canopy of the sky.  Beyond the lodges to the west was...a swirling sea of reddish brown that the soldiers only gradually realized was the village's herd of fifteen thousand to twenty thousand ponies.\".}} Given the village's large size, Custer's first thought was to bring up the pack train as quickly as possible with its reserve supply of ammunition...and at this point he sent Sergeant Kanipe back to McDougall with a verbal message telling him to hurry up with the ammunition.{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=165.}}  Custer returned to his troops and continued north, again behind the bluffs and out of sight from the village.  When Custer rode to the edge of the bluffs again, he realized the village was even larger than first thought.  Given the immense size of the village Custer realized he needed not only the pack train, but also the three troops under Captain Benteen, and he called over his trumpeter John Martin, and sent him to Benteen with a verbal as well as a written message, signed by the adjutant Lt. Cooke, which read: \"Benteen,  Come on, Big Village, Be Quick, bring packs, W. W. Cooke.  P.S. Bring pacs(sic)\".{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=180, 181.}}  Custer and his five troops then rode off.  Trumpeter Martin was one of the last surviving member of the 7th cavalry to see or talk with Custer.\n\nAfter driving Reno from the valley, the rapidly growing force of Indian warriors coming from the now thoroughly aroused Indian village had shifted their focus to deal with the approach from the north and east by the five troops with Custer.  During this lull, Reno's battered contingent on the bluffs had been joined and reinforced by Benteen's three troops.\n\nBenteen's troops had been initially ordered by Custer to veer off to the south to look into the Little Bighorn valley and ascertain if there were other Indian villages there.{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=201.}}  After a fruitless several hours Benteen had abandoned that search and had returned to the original line of march taken by Custer and Reno to the Little Bighorn River down the course of a small tributary, Sundance Creek, (now Reno Creek), where he stopped to water the horses of his three troops at a swampy area later referred to as \"the morass\".  Just as Benteen troops were leaving the morass, Lt McDougall came up with the pack train.{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=201, 202.}}  The pack train mules had not had water since the evening before and when they smelled water in the boggy area of Sundance Creek they bolted and became mired for a time in \"the morass\".{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=201-203.}} After a delay of about 20 minutes McDougall extracted the mules of his pack train from the morass on Sun Dance Creek, and was proceeding toward the Little Bighorn when he heard volleys, \"a dull sound\" as he later remembered, that resonated through the hills.  As remembered by McDougall and others this was the beginnings of Custer's battle.{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=220.}} <ref name=\"Gray\">{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=John S. |title=\"The Pack Train on George A Custer's Last Campaign |journal=Nebraska History |date=1976 |issue=57 |page=65 |url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/history/full-text/NH1976PackTrain.pdf |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>   \n\nBeenteen was continuing on toward the Little Bighorn when he encountered Sergeant Kanipe, who paused only briefly, as Custer after his first glimpse of the village had directed Kanipe back to contact Captain McDougall personally and order him to bring up the pack train and the extra ammunition with all speed.  Kanipe continued on and met McDougall about 4 miles further down Sundance Creek from the morass.  The pack train stopped again to allow the strung out mules to close ranks, and then resumed the trail in better order, but \"still at little better than a walk\".{{sfn|Gray|1976|p=65.}}\n\nBenteen then encountered the Custer's second messenger, Trumpeter John Martin with the written order for Benteen himself, to \"Come on, Big Village, Be Quick, bring packs\".{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=203.}}  After a conference with his officers, Benteen pocketed this message and did nothing further to inform McDougall of the urgent nature of this message, but proceeded forward at a trot down Sun Dance Creek and after a delay arrived at Reno's position on the bluffs. {{sfn|Gray|1976|p=65.}} \n\nAt Reno Hill, Reno and Benteen conferred, and after a delay of about 20 minutes Reno and Benteen sent Lt. Hare on a run back to the pack train to hurry up the ammunition.  Packers Churchill and Mann cut out two of these animals and drove them ahead of the pack train to Reno Hill.  The rest of the train arrived in the next half hour, to learn that Custer's battalion was somewhere to the north.{{sfn|Gray|1976|p=65.}}\n\n===June 25, McDougall joins Reno in his entrenchment and passes under his command===\n\nWhen McDougall arrived at the area where Reno and Benteen were located, he passed under the orders of Major Reno.  He took part in an advance to the north to Weir Point, but then retreated back to Reno's original position, where they were attacked by large contingents of Sioux Indians returning from wiping out Custer and his five troops.  McDougall's troop and the pack train remained under attack along with Reno and Benteen's troops on the bluffs overlooking the Little Bighorn valley throughout the rest of June 25, and until the late afternoon of the 26th when the Indian warriors withdrew and the Indian village in the valley packed up and moved south, going up the Little Bighorn valley.  The movement of the Indians was in response to the advance of General Gibbons on June 26th up the Little Bighorn valley with additional infantry and cavalry units.  During the night of June 26, McDougall with two enlisted men recovered the body of Lieutenant Hodgson who had fallen in the valley fight and buried it on Reno Hill.<ref name=\"Thrapp\"/>\n\nOn June 27 Col.

Col. [[George A. Custer]] were the main combat element of a larger column of soldiers, called the Dakota Column commanded by General [[Alfred Terry]].{{sfn|Donovan|2009|p=99,117,118,134. The column also had 3 companies of infantry, about 40 men, to protect supply bases; a detachment of 40 Arikara and 4 Sioux Indian Scouts; an artillery detachment of four guns with 34 men; and 150 supply wagons.}}\n\nThe Dakota Column was to meet with General John Gibbon's Montana Column at the mouth of the Powder River.  On reaching the Powder River General Terry learned from General John Gibbon that his scouts had located a large Sioux village that had been seen on lower Rosebud Creek.  General Terry believed that the village had gone up the Rosebud and then over western drainages, but he dispatched the Seventh's \"right wing\" under Major Reno to scout the Powder and the Tongue to ensure that the village had not turned back east.  The \"right wing\" consisted Companies I, E, L, F, and B Company led by \"easygoing Tom McDougall\".{{sfn|Donovan|2009|p=160-163}}  Deviating from General Terry's orders Major Reno shortened his inspection of the Powder River and the Tongue and went over to Reno Creek, where he confirmed a series of large fresh campsites from the Sioux village of some 400 plus lodges as it moved up Rosebud Creek.{{sfn|Donovan|2009|p=162-165}} This information led General Terry to concentrate his troops at the mouth of Rosebud Creek, and then on June 22, 1876 to dispatch Custer with the entire 7th Cavalry up the Rosebud in pursuit of the Sioux village.{{sfn|Donovan|2009|p=172-184}} On June 24, Custer learned from his Indian Scouts that the village had gone over the divide into the Little Horn Valley.{{sfn|Donovan|2009|p=200-206}}\n\n===Morning, June 25, assigned to take charge of the pack train===\n\nOn the early morning of the day of battle, June 25, 1876, Custer and the 7th Cavalry were on the divide between Rosebud Creek and the Little Bighorn River.  From this divide, the Crow scouts had discovered indications of a large Sioux and Cheyenne village in the Valley of the Little Bighorn River at about 14\u201316 air miles distance. Custer divided his command into 4 groups. Colonel Custer retained five troops (C, E, F, I, and L) and assigned Major Reno three troops (A,G, and M) and these two groups proceeded down a small tributary of the Little Big Horn River (present day Reno Creek, referred to by the Sioux in 1876 as Sundance Creek) toward the Indian village in the Little Big Horn valley. Captain Benteen was also assigned three troops(H, D, and K) and sent off on a lateral path to the southwest to see if there were other Indian villages in the valley to the south.\n\nCaptain McDougall and his Troop B was assigned to guard the pack train and they comprised the fourth group.  Lt. Edward G. Mathey was the officer assigned to be in charge of the pack train and its permanent personnel, but since it had critical supplies for the column, including the column's extra ammunition Custer ordered one troop to be detached to safeguard it. \"Captain McDougall had fallen asleep prior to officer's call and had been the last to report to Adjutant Cooke.  As a consequence, McDougall's B Company was assigned to guard Lieutenant Mathey's slow moving pack train.\"{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=151.}}  \"Some of his  [McDougal's] disappointed troopers, doubtful they would see any action, wept at this.\"{{sfn|Donovan|2009|p=210.}}\n\nAt the Reno Court of Inquiry in January 1879, McDougall testified that at about 11{{nbsp}}a.m. on June 25th, on the Divide between the Rosebud and the Little Big Horn, he was ordered by Custer to \"take charge of the pack train and serve as a rear guard\".<ref name=\"Reno Court of Inquiry\">{{cite web|title=Reno, Marcus A., Court of Inquiry, January 1879, The official record of a court of inquiry convened at Chicago, Illinois, January 13, 1879, by the President of the United States upon the request of Major Marcus A.

Custer's \"striker\" John Burkman was left with the pack grain, along with Custer's second horse Dandy and his two hounds.\n\n===June 25, order to bring pack train to Custer with all speed===\n\nOn the 25th, as the other three detachments advanced down a small tributary of the Little Bighorn River called Sun Dance Creek (present day Reno Creek) toward the Sioux village in the valley, the mules of the pack train under McDougall's charge lagged behind as they usually did when the column was on the move.\n\nHistorians believe that the village was much larger than Custer had anticipated.{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=164-165.}}<ref name=\"Stiles\">{{cite book |last=Stiles |first=T.

The remnants of Reno's command stopped on top of the bluffs and attempted to dig in.{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=168-180, 182\u2013187, 188\u2013205.}}\n\nCuster's five troops had approached the Indian camp by a different route than taken by Reno, which had not allowed Custer to view the valley or see the village.   Custer left his five troops and rode up to the edge of the high bluffs just east of the Little Bighorn Valley and was confronted by a view of a very large Indian village.{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=164. \"They rode on until they were approaching the ridgeline and suddenly they saw it: the flat and seemingly endless expanse of the Little Bighorn Valley...And there two miles to the northwest...was the largest Indian village any of them had ever seen: hundreds of gleaming white teepees beneath the soaring transparent canopy of the sky.  Beyond the lodges to the west was...a swirling sea of reddish brown that the soldiers only gradually realized was the village's herd of fifteen thousand to twenty thousand ponies.\".}} Given the village's large size, Custer's first thought was to bring up the pack train as quickly as possible with its reserve supply of ammunition...and at this point he sent Sergeant Kanipe back to McDougall with a verbal message telling him to hurry up with the ammunition.{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=165.}}  Custer returned to his troops and continued north, again behind the bluffs and out of sight from the village.  When Custer rode to the edge of the bluffs again, he realized the village was even larger than first thought.  Given the immense size of the village Custer realized he needed not only the pack train, but also the three troops under Captain Benteen, and he called over his trumpeter John Martin, and sent him to Benteen with a verbal as well as a written message, signed by the adjutant Lt. Cooke, which read: \"Benteen,  Come on, Big Village, Be Quick, bring packs, W. W. Cooke.  P.S. Bring pacs(sic)\".{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=180, 181.}}  Custer and his five troops then rode off.  Trumpeter Martin was one of the last surviving member of the 7th cavalry to see or talk with Custer.\n\nAfter driving Reno from the valley, the rapidly growing force of Indian warriors coming from the now thoroughly aroused Indian village had shifted their focus to deal with the approach from the north and east by the five troops with Custer.  During this lull, Reno's battered contingent on the bluffs had been joined and reinforced by Benteen's three troops.\n\nBenteen's troops had been initially ordered by Custer to veer off to the south to look into the Little Bighorn valley and ascertain if there were other Indian villages there.{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=201.}}  After a fruitless several hours Benteen had abandoned that search and had returned to the original line of march taken by Custer and Reno to the Little Bighorn River down the course of a small tributary, Sundance Creek, (now Reno Creek), where he stopped to water the horses of his three troops at a swampy area later referred to as \"the morass\".  Just as Benteen troops were leaving the morass, Lt McDougall came up with the pack train.{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=201, 202.}}  The pack train mules had not had water since the evening before and when they smelled water in the boggy area of Sundance Creek they bolted and became mired for a time in \"the morass\".{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=201-203.}} After a delay of about 20 minutes McDougall extracted the mules of his pack train from the morass on Sun Dance Creek, and was proceeding toward the Little Bighorn when he heard volleys, \"a dull sound\" as he later remembered, that resonated through the hills.  As remembered by McDougall and others this was the beginnings of Custer's battle.{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=220.}} <ref name=\"Gray\">{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=John S. |title=\"The Pack Train on George A Custer's Last Campaign |journal=Nebraska History |date=1976 |issue=57 |page=65 |url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/history/full-text/NH1976PackTrain.pdf |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>   \n\nBeenteen was continuing on toward the Little Bighorn when he encountered Sergeant Kanipe, who paused only briefly, as Custer after his first glimpse of the village had directed Kanipe back to contact Captain McDougall personally and order him to to bring up the pack train and the extra ammunition with all speed.  Kanipe continued on and met McDougall about 4 miles further down Sundance Creek from the morass.  The pack train stopped again to allow the strung out mules to close ranks, and then resumed the trail in better order, but \"still at little better than a walk\".{{sfn|Gray|1976|p=65.}}\n\nBenteen then encountered the Custer's second messenger, Trumpeter John Martin with the written order for Benteen himself, to \"Come on, Big Village, Be Quick, bring packs\".{{sfn|Philbrick|2010|p=203.}}  After a conference with his officers, Benteen pocketed this message and did nothing further to inform McDougall of the urgent nature of this message, but proceeded forward at a trot down Sun Dance Creek and after a delay arrived at Reno's position on the bluffs. {{sfn|Gray|1976|p=65.}} \n\nAt Reno Hill, Reno and Benteen conferred, and after a delay of about 20 minutes Reno and Benteen sent Lt. Hare on a run back to the pack train to hurry up the ammunition.  Packers Churchill and Mann cut out two of these animals and drove them ahead of the pack train to Reno Hill.  The rest of the train arrived in the next half hour, to learn that Custer's battalion was somewhere to the north.{{sfn|Gray|1976|p=65.}}\n\n===June 25, McDougall joins Reno in his entrenchment and passes under his command===\n\nWhen McDougall arrived at the area where Reno and Benteen were located, he passed under the orders of Major Reno.  He took part in an advance to the north to Weir Point, but then retreated back to Reno's original position, where they were attacked by large contingents of Sioux Indians returning from wiping out Custer and his five troops.  McDougall's troop and the pack train remained under attack along with Reno and Benteen's troops on the bluffs overlooking the Little Bighorn valley throughout the rest of June 25, and until the late afternoon of the 26th when the Indian warriors withdrew and the Indian village in the valley packed up and moved south, going up the Little Bighorn valley.  The movement of the Indians was in response to the advance of General Gibbons on June 26th up the Little Bighorn valley with additional infantry and cavalry units.  During the night of June 26, McDougall with two enlisted men recovered the body of Lieutenant Hodgson who had fallen in the valley fight and buried it on Reno Hill.<ref name=\"Thrapp\"/>\n\nOn June 27 Col. Gibbon arrived at the site of the battle with infantry reinforcements, and relieved the 7th Cavalry troops under Major Reno and Captain Benteen.  It was then discovered that several miles north of the Reno entrenchments, the five troops with Custer had been surrounded and wiped out to the last man.\n\n==Later career==\n\nIn 1877, the year after the Battle of the Little Bighorn, McDougall was engaged with the 7th cavalry in scouting in Montana during the Nez Perce troubles in 1877, and commanded part of the escort for the surrendered Chief Joseph and his people from Bear Paw Mountain, Montana, to Fort Abraham Lincoln, Dakota.<ref name=\"Thrapp\" />\n\nHe remained in Montana and Dakota Territory until 1880 and returned to Dakota in 1882 remaining until 1888.<ref name=\"Thrapp\" /> \nMcDougall remained in the 7th Cavalry until retired for disability in the line of duty on July 22, 1890.<ref name=\"Patterson\"/><ref name=\"Thrapp\" />  He appeared on the 1880 Federal census of Billings, Custer County, Montana Territory, enumerated 12 June 1880.\n\nFor his Civil War service, he was promoted to Major of Cavalry (Retired) on May 24, 1904, to rank from April 23, 1904.<ref name=\"Patterson\"/>\n\n==Comment in 1897 letter from Captain Benteen==\n\nFrom Benteen's letter of March 29, 1897, to photographer D.F.

{"title_page": "Ancient warfare", "text_new": "{{About|ancient warfare|the magazine with the same title|Ancient Warfare (magazine)}}\n{{short description|War through the end of the ancient period}}\n{{History of war}}\n'''Ancient warfare''' is [[war]] that was conducted from the beginning of [[recorded history]] to the end of the [[ancient period]]. In [[Europe]] and the [[Near East]], the end of antiquity is often equated with the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Fall of Rome]] in 476 AD, the wars of the Eastern Roman Empire on its Southwestern Asian and North African borders, and the beginnings of the [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century. In [[China]], it can also be seen as ending of the growing role of mounted warriors needed to counter the ever-growing threat from the north in the 5th century and the beginning of the [[Tang dynasty]] in 618 AD. In [[Indian subcontinent|India]], the ancient period ends with the decline of the [[Gupta Empire]] (6th century) and the beginning of the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquests there]] from the 8th century. In [[Japan]], the ancient period is considered to end with the rise of [[feudalism]] in the [[Kamakura period]] in the 12\u201313th century.\n\nThe difference between [[Prehistoric warfare|prehistoric]] and ancient warfare is more organization oriented than technology oriented. The development of first [[city-state]]s, and then [[empire]]s, allowed warfare to change dramatically. Beginning in [[Mesopotamia]], [[State (polity)|states]] produced sufficient agricultural surplus. This allowed full-time ruling elites and military commanders to emerge. While the bulk of military forces were still farmers, the society could support having them campaigning rather than working the land for a portion of each year. Thus, organized armies developed for the first time.\n\nThese new armies we able to help states grow in size and become increasingly centralized. Early ancient armies continued to primarily use [[bow and arrow|bows]] and [[spear]]s, the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting. The findings at the site of [[Nataruk]] in [[Turkana County|Turkana]], Kenya, have been interpreted as evidence of inter-group conflict and warfare in antiquity,<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Inter-group violence among early Holocene hunter-gatherers of West Turkana, Kenya|journal = Nature|pages = 394\u201398|volume = 529|issue = 7586|doi = 10.1038/nature16477|first = M.

The infantries at this time would be divided into ranged and shock, with shock infantry either charging to cause penetration of the enemy line or hold their own. These forces would ideally be combined, thus presenting the opponent with a dilemma: group the forces and leave them vulnerable to ranged, or spread them out and make them vulnerable to shock. This balance would eventually change as technology allowed for chariots, cavalry, and artillery to play an active role on the field.\n\nNo clear line can be drawn between ancient and [[medieval warfare]]. The characteristic properties of medieval warfare, notably [[heavy cavalry]] and [[Medieval siege weaponry|siege engines]] such as the [[trebuchet]] were first introduced in [[Late Antiquity]]. The main division within the ancient period is at the beginning [[Iron Age]] with the introduction of [[cavalry]] (resulting in the decline of [[chariot warfare]]), of [[naval warfare]] ([[Sea Peoples]]), and the development of an industry based on [[ferrous metallurgy]] which allowed for the mass production of metal weapons and thus the equipment of large standing armies.\nThe first military power to profit from these innovations was the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], which achieved a [[List of largest empires#Ancient empires|hitherto unseen]] extent of centralized control, the first \"[[world power]]\" to extend over the entire [[Fertile Crescent]] ([[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]).\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Chariots ==\n{{main|Chariot}}\nAs states grew in size, speed of being able to mobilize became crucial because central power could not hold if rebellions could not be suppressed rapidly. The first solution to this was the [[chariot]] which was initially used in the [[Middle East]] from around 1800 BC. First pulled by [[oxen]] and [[donkey]]s, they allowed rapid traversing of the relatively flat lands of the Middle East. The chariots were light enough that they could easily be floated across rivers. Improvements in the ability to train [[horse]]s soon allowed them to be used to pull chariots, possibly as early as 2100 BC,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kuznetsov | first1 = P.F. | year = 2006 | title = The emergence of Bronze Age chariots in eastern Europe | url = | journal = Antiquity | volume = 80 | issue = 309| pages = 638\u201345 | doi=10.1017/s0003598x00094096}}</ref> and their greater speed and power made chariots even more efficient. The major limitation of the use of chariots was terrain; while very mobile on flat, hard, open ground, it was very difficult if not impossible to make any head way through more bumpy terrain. Bumpy terrain being; rough ground, even sparse trees or bushes, small ravines or streams, or marsh. In these terrains chariots were surpassed in maneuverability by common foot soldiers, and later by [[cavalry]].\n\nThe power of the chariot as a device both of transportation and of warfare became the central weapon of the peoples of the [[Ancient Near East]] in the 2nd millennium BC. The typical chariot was worked by two men: one would be a bowman who would fire at enemy forces, while the other would control the vehicle. Over time, chariots were developed to be able to carry up to five warriors. In [[China]], [[Chariot (Ancient China)|their chariots]] became the central weapon of the [[Shang dynasty]], allowing them to unify a great area.\n \nAlthough chariots have been compared to modern-day [[tank]]s in the role they played on the battlefield, i.e., [[shock attack]]s, this is disputed<ref>{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Alan B.|title=A Companion to Ancient Egyp|year=2010|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-5598-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RK2pLin2sPAC&pg=PA438&dq=egyptian+chariots+tanks#v=onepage&q=%20%20chariots%20tanks&f=false|page=438}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Drews|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Drews|title=The end of the Bronze Age: changes in warfare and the catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C|year=1995|edition=new|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02591-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&pg=PA121&dq=egyptian+chariots+tanks#v=onepage&q=%20%20tank&f=false|page=221}}</ref> with scholars pointing out that chariots were vulnerable and fragile, required a level terrain while tanks are all-terrain vehicles, and thus not suitable for use in the way modern tanks have been used as a physical shock force.<ref>{{cite book|last=Littauer|first=M.A.|title=Wheeled vehicles and ridden animals in the ancient Near East|year=1979|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-05953-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TcoUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA98&dq=ancient+near+east+chariots++tanks#v=onepage&q=ancient%20near%20east%20chariots%20%20tanks&f=false|author2=J.

Because tightly packed infantry were the formation of choice, in order for ancient generals to maintain [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] during the battle as well as for mutual protection. A force of chariots could stand off at long range and rain arrows down on the infantrymen's heads. Because of their speed, any attempts to charge the chariots could be easily evaded. If, on the other hand, an infantry unit spread out to minimize the damage from arrows, they would lose the benefit of mutual protection and the charioteers could easily overrun them.\n\nFrom a tactical standpoint this put any force facing chariots into a tactical dilemma, making chariots indispensable to armies of those times. Chariots, however, were complicated pieces of hardware that required specialized craftsmen to maintain them. Such services, therefore, made chariots expensive to own. When chariots were owned by individuals within a society, it tended to give rise to a warrior class of specialists and a [[feudal system]] (an example of which can be seen in [[Homer]]'s [[The Iliad]]). Where chariots were publicly owned, they helped in the maintenance and establishment of a strong central government, e.g., the [[New Kingdom|New Egyptian Kingdom]]. Chariot usage peaked in the [[Battle of Kadesh]] in 1274 BC, which was probably the largest chariot battle ever fought, involving perhaps 5,000 chariots.<ref name=\"Parragon\">{{cite book|author=Dr. Aaron Ralby|title=Atlas of Military History|url=https://archive.org/details/atlasofworldmili0000ralb|url-access=registration|year=2013|publisher=Parragon|isbn=978-1-4723-0963-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/atlasofworldmili0000ralb/page/54 54\u201355]|chapter=Battle of Kadesh, c. 1274 BCE: Clash of Empires}}</ref>\n\n== Naval warfare ==\n{{main|Naval warfare}}\nNaval warfare in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]] can be traced back to the third millennium BC Mediterranean as evidence of paintings on Cyclades and models of ships were being made across the Aegean.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Essays and Reflections: Naval Warfare in the Ancient World: Myths and Realities|last=Lazenby|first=J.F.|publisher=Taylor & Francis, Ltd.|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=438}}</ref> Ships in this era have been said to have served as both ordinary transportation and trade vessels as well as having some military and warfare applications.

Instead of importing mass amounts of timber in order to build warships, Egyptian naval architects and early engineers began to convert the common river-going ships.

There are various different accounts that lay down foundations of what equipment was used and how these ships engaged in combat. The main military applications of Greek Triremes, besides the transport of troops and supplies, would be the advantages of ramming tactics.  Developments and innovations of the Greek Trireme evolved over time, especially in respects to ramming tactics. Naval architects during this time saw fit to bring about full effectiveness and damaging power to these ships. By doing this, the amount of manpower would stay consistent, i.e., keeping the same amount of rowing power but shortening the length of the ship to condense the ramming power while keeping speed and agility consistent.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship|last=Morrison |last2=Coates |last3=Rankov|first=J.S. |first2=J.F. |first3=N.B. |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Great Britain|page=30}}</ref> This new ideology of warfare and naval tactics would prove to be prudent to the overall military applications of the Trireme, and soon would become the principal combative strategy of the Greek navy and other navies alike.\n\nThe Greek Trireme, soon after its appearance in the Aegean, would become the standard warship throughout the Mediterranean as sovereign states such as Egypt and even the Persian Empire would adopt the design of these ships and apply them to their own military applications. One major attraction of the Greek design was not only its efficient ramming capability but also its ability to travel long distances at fair speeds. One account from the Athenian soldier and historian Xenophon describes the voyage of the Athenian fleet commander Iphicrates through unfriendly waters and the strategy he used combined with the sheer sailing power of the Trireme. <blockquote>\"He proceeded with his journey and at the same time made all the necessary preparations for action, at the outset leaving his main sails behind as if he was expecting an engagement. In addition, even if there was a following wind he used his small [boat] sails little, but progressed by oar [instead, presumably, of using main sails and boat sails when the wind was favourable]. Thus he both improved the fitness of his men and achieved a higher speed for his ships\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship|last=Morrison |last2=Coates |last3=Rankov|first=J.S. |first2=J.F. |first3=N.B. |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Great Britain|page=97}}</ref></blockquote>This primary source account can be interpreted as a functional and efficient use of the Greek trireme. Maximizing its speed through rugged and unfriendly seas while also utilizing specific military strategy in order to ensure the most prudent and effective outcome was what led to the success of the trireme across all kinds of empires and civilizations throughout the Mediterranean. The trireme would later become a vital piece of naval weaponry throughout the Persian Wars, for both the Greeks and the Persian Empire, as well as the base standard for the formation of the Roman Navy.\n\nThe [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian Wars]] were the first to feature large-scale naval operations: not only sophisticated fleet engagements with dozens of [[trireme]]s on each side, but also combined land\u2013sea operations. Ships in the ancient world could operate only on the relatively quiet waters of seas and rivers; the oceans were off limits. Navies were almost always used as auxiliaries to land forces, often essential to bringing them supplies. They would rarely strike out on their own. With only limited-range weapons, naval galleys would often attempt to ram their opponents with their reinforced bow to cause damage or sink the enemy warships which often caused the two ships to become joined together, and initiated a boarding battle. Only occasionally was a decisive naval battle fought, such as the [[Battle of Lade]] in which a Persian navy destroyed the Greek navy.\n\n== Tactics and weapons ==\n\n=== Strategy ===\nAncient strategy focused broadly on the twin goals of convincing the enemy that continued war was more costly than submitting, and of making the most gain possible from war.\n\nForcing the enemy to submit generally consisted of defeating their army in the field. Once the enemy force was routed, the threat of siege, civilian deaths, and the like often forced the enemy to the bargaining table. However, this goal could be accomplished by other means. Burning enemy fields would force the choice of surrendering or fighting a [[pitched battle]]. Waiting an enemy out until their army had to disband due to the beginning of the harvest season or running out of payment for mercenaries presented an enemy with a similar choice. The exceptional conflicts of the ancient world were when these rules of warfare were violated. The Spartan and Athenian refusal to accept surrender after many years of war and near bankruptcy in the [[Peloponnesian War]] is one such exceptional example, as is the Roman refusal to surrender after the [[Battle of Cannae]].\n\nA more personal goal in war was simple profit. This profit was often monetary, as was the case with the raiding culture of the Gallic tribes. But the profit could be political, as great leaders in war were often rewarded with government office after their success. These strategies often contradict modern common sense as they conflict with what would be best for the states involved in the war.\n\n=== Tactics ===\n{{Main|Military Tactics}}\nEffective tactics varied greatly, depending on:\n# The army's size\n# Unit types\n# Terrain\n# The weather\n# Positional advantage\n# Skill level\n# Individual battle experience\n# Individual morale\n# Armament (quantity and quality)\n\n=== Weapons ===\n{{main|List of ancient weapons}}\nAncient weapons included the [[spear]], the [[atlatl]] with light javelin or similar projectile, the [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and arrow, the [[Sling (weapon)|sling]]; [[polearm]]s such as the [[spear]], [[falx]] and [[pilum|javelin]]; hand-to-hand weapons such as [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, [[Club (weapon)|clubs]], [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s, [[axe]]s, and [[knife|knives]]. [[Catapult]]s, [[siege tower]]s, and [[battering ram]]s were used during [[siege]]s.\n\nThere were a wide variety and range of weapons used in the wars and battles of times long past and while it is quite easy to identify a sword or shield and know what purpose it served, even more information can be gained from knowing where said weapon comes from and what material it is made of. Ancient Greece is one of the most looked to and studied periods of time in part due the abundance of surviving information and artifacts and this aspect can also be extended to their weaponry and armor. The Mycenaean left behind a great deal of their weapons and armor which was found in their shaft graves, in ''Arms and Armour of the Greeks'' the swords found within the Mycenaean tombs are quite similar to rapiers being quite slender and measuring in at over three feet in length. It was due to their length and slim design that they were easily broken if struck hard enough. In addition to the rapier swords, smaller yet more durable blades were found along with a few spearheads which often came in at over two feet in length; however, the spearheads were not quite as abundant as other bladed weapons as Snodgrass states that their value and use in war and hunting was too significant to spare for graves. Prior to the Bronze Age the Mycenaean helmets were constructed from crescent shaped sections of wild boar tusk and arranged in horizontal bands that alternated in direction and attached to a soft material.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Arms and Armour of the Greeks|last=Snodgrass|first=A.M.|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1967|isbn=|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=}}</ref> The soldiers\u2019 shields were around four feet tall, if not more, made of ox hide and supported with some type of metal. As we move into the Bronze Age body armor began to appear as the smiths began working with this new metal, bronze helmets also began to make an appearance though the previous helmets made from boars\u2019 tusks still remained in use. It was during this period that two new types of swords made a debut, they were the horned and cruciform swords. The horned sword was dubbed as such from the horn-like appearance of their hand guards and was the preferred weapon for a cutting stroke. The cruciform sword was derived and enhanced from a Minoan dagger with flanges on the hilt with rounded, right angle hand guards is how it is described within ''Arms and Armour'' . Spears continued to remain as the preferred means for a thrusting weapon, but it was during the Palace Period that they developed a socketed base. In earlier periods of Greek history, the bow and arrow was not a favored weapon for war but used primarily in hunting though in the Palace Period archery began to prosper \u2013 the arrowheads of both time periods were made of flint, bronze, or obsidian \u2013 while the bows of the Palace Period were made of goats\u2019 horn is how Snodgrass depicts the use of archery. From the Palace Period, we move into the Late Period of Mycenae where the weapons became shorter and more suited for use in a work environment rather than in battle and the metal plated armor was no longer being put to use.\n\nMacedon was known more traditionally for having a strong cavalry rather than infantry and during Alexander's reign the Sarissophori came into being and this was unique Alexander's time in power. While the cavalry was more prominent the Macedon infantry, made up of the poor and peasant classes, formed into a new and unique branch of the military that was different from the hoplite. These warriors were armed with a huge pike weapon called a sarissa as well as the army being equipped with slings. The slings used almond-shaped bronze bullets that were engraved with either Philip's or his generals\u2019 name and as for siege warfare the Macedonians used an arrow-firing catapult.<ref name=\":2\" /> For armor, they were equipped with a metal helmet, greaves, and a shield covered with bronze.\n\nIn ''The Archaeology of Weapons'' a broader account of ancient weaponry is taken into account through the investigation of European weapons. Oakeshott believes that at some point between 1500\u2013100 BC that the sword developed from the knife in both Minoan Crete and Celtic Britain and strongly resembles the rapiers. During the Bronze Age in the same general region several other swords were developed: the Hallstatt first appeared during this Age but did not become widely used until the Iron Age, the Carps Tongues, and the Rhone Valley swords. The Hallstatt swords gained prominence during the Iron Age and were a long sword with a rather curious point that was one of three shapes: rounded, a square shape, or similar to a fishtail, and were the preferred weapon for use in a chariot. The Carps Tongues blade were also rather large swords with the edges running parallel for two-thirds of the blade before narrowing to the usually point. The last sword is that of the Rhone Valley and is generally considered more of small sword or an overly large dagger with each hilt uniquely cast in bronze. The pommel of this type of dagger has the ends drawn out into two thin points that curve in towards the blade. Along with Hallstatt swords there were found to be spears, similar to the spearheads found in Mycenae they were quite large at fifteen inches and having a hollow socket however they were unique in that they had a small collar of bronze near where they attached to the shaft.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Weapons|last=Oakeshott|first=Ewart|publisher=Boydell Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK|pages=}}</ref>\n\nWithin India's long history there are several different regimes that produced unique weapons. The list of weapons primarily used in India are the battle axe, the bow and arrow, spears, spike, barbed dart, the sword, iron club, javelin, iron arrow, and the scimitar.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Arms and Armour Traditional Weapons of India|last=Jaiwant|first=Paul E.|publisher=Roli and Janssen|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> One sword type is the katar blade, these are equipped with sword breaking bars and both the shape and size would depend on whether the bearer was cavalry or an infantryman. A curved sword such as the talwar or shamsheer was ideal for a cutting motion delivered from horseback. There were three early iron sword types being the leaf shaped, spoon shaped and the parallel sword each ideal for thrusting and jabbing as opposed to a striking or cutting motion. The Rajputs, Gurkhas, Nagas, and Coorg and Malabar each developed a weapon unique to themselves. The Rajputs wielded the khanda which is a broad and straight sword with a wider point. The Gurkhas had two swords that they preferred to use the kukri, a short sword that angled towards wide tip, and the kora, their historical war sword which was around 60 centimeters with a single edge that was rather narrow near the handler and curving towards the front.<ref name=\":3\" /> The daos had a blade equal to two feet in length that had a wide and square-like tip and the handle was made of either wood or ivory, these were the weapons that came to popularity for the Nagas. The adya katti was a single edged blade also near two feet long but with no handle and wield by the Coorg and Malabar. In Southern India, the Borobudur and the Veragal, either shaped like a hook or a wavy design, were the swords in use. A rather unique weapon used in India is the Baghnakh which are similar to a knuckle duster and were used to slit the opponent's throat or belly.\n\nArmor in India can be found dating back to 500 BC and Vedic literature; there are several different types: leather and fabric, scale, brigandine, lamellar, mail, plate, and a combination of mail and plate.<ref name=\":3\" /> In ''Arms and Armour: Traditional Weapons of India'' it is read that the wrastrana, a breast plate, has been in use since prehistoric times though the most popular is the char-aina meaning four mirrors is a coat of mail overlaid with four elaborately designed plates. The helmets consisted of a sliding nose guard with a piece of chainmail hanging from it designed to protect the neck and shoulders. Armor was not just limited to human soldiers but extended to their horses and elephants as well. The horse armor was made up of mail and plates or lamellae which covered the neck, chest, and hindquarters underneath which was some form of padding to keep it in place while a face plate protected the animal's face. The elephants, used as a battering ram or to break and trample enemy lines, were also donned in armor for battle. The elephant's head was covered by a steel mask and covered half of the trunk while the throat and sides were protected by lamellae armor while the tusks were tipped with sharp metal.\n\n=== Sieges ===\n{{main|Siege}}\n[[File:Ramesseum siege of Dapur.jpg|thumb|The Egyptian [[siege of Dapur]] in the 13th century BC, from [[Ramesseum]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].]]\n\nSiege warfare of the [[ancient Near East]] took place behind walls built of mud bricks, stone, wood or a combination of these materials depending on local availability. The earliest representations of siege warfare date to the [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt]], c. 3000 BC, while the first siege equipment is known from Egyptian tomb reliefs of the 24th century BC showing wheeled siege ladders. [[Assyria]]n palace reliefs of the 9th to 7th centuries BC display sieges of several Near Eastern cities. Though a simple battering ram had come into use in the previous millennium, the Assyrians improved siege warfare. The most common practise of siege warfare was, however, to lay siege and wait for the surrender of the enemies inside. Due to the problem of logistics, long lasting sieges involving anything but a minor force could seldom be maintained.\n\nAncient siege warfare varied from each civilization and how each city was defended differently and had to approached with different tactics. One way to ensure an army used all its troops in its siege is shown when its explained how a chariot can be used in a siege, saying that, \u201cDuring the sieges, the chariots, and mostly in the Neo-Assyrian armies, were surely employed to patrol and protect the flanks and the rear of the besiegers\u2019 lines and camp.\u201d (UF 41 p. 5).<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThis shows that generals had to find new tactics to incorporate parts of their army that wouldn\u2019t work in the siege, as shown with the chariots on patrol duty and ensuring the army was safe from a flank attack from the enemy army. This strategy ensures that all forces are used and contributing to the battle effort and helping gain victory for them and all pulling their weight as well.\n\n== By culture ==\n\n=== Ancient Near East ===\n\n==== Mesopotamia ====\n{{main|Military history of the Assyrian Empire|Military history of Iraq}}\n\n==== Egypt ====\n{{main|Military history of Egypt|Military of ancient Egypt}}\nThroughout most of its history, [[ancient Egypt]] was unified under one government. The main military concern for the nation was to keep enemies out. The arid plains and deserts surrounding Egypt were inhabited by nomadic tribes who occasionally tried to raid or settle in the fertile [[Nile]] river valley. The [[Egyptians]] built fortresses and outposts along the borders east and west of the Nile Delta, in the Eastern Desert, and in [[Nubia]] to the south. Small garrisons could prevent minor incursions, but if a large force was detected a message was sent for the main army corps. Most Egyptian cities lacked city walls and other defenses.\n\nThe first Egyptian soldiers carried a simple armament consisting of a spear with a copper spearhead and a large wooden shield covered by leather hides. A stone mace was also carried in the Archaic period, though later this weapon was probably only in ceremonial use, and was replaced with the bronze battle axe. The spearmen were supported by archers carrying a composite bow and arrows with arrowheads made of flint or copper. No armour was used during the 3rd and early 2nd Millennium BC. As the dynasties expanded and grew upon the last that fell to gain new territory and control new people for the empire of Egypt. One of the ways the dynasties were different were the new technologies used in the later dynasties against the enemy. One example is the armies of Ramesses\u2019 II faced off against the Hittites in the Battle of Qadesh. Both armies have cavalry units supporting their infantry and scouts to get updates on the movements. These advances differ from two groups attacking head on for control of an area and facing losses on both sides\n\nThe major advance in weapons technology and warfare began around 1600 BC when the Egyptians fought and defeated the [[Hyksos]] people, who ruled Lower Egypt at the time. It was during this period the horse and chariot were introduced into Egypt. Other new technologies included the [[sickle sword]], body [[armour]] and improved bronze casting. In the [[New Kingdom]], the Egyptian military changed from levy troops into a firm organization of professional soldiers. Conquests of foreign territories, like Nubia, required a permanent force to be garrisoned abroad. The Egyptians were mostly used to slowly defeating a much weaker enemy, town by town, until beaten into submission. The preferred tactic was to subdue a weaker city or kingdom one at a time resulting in surrender of each fraction until complete domination was achieved. The encounter with other powerful Near Eastern kingdoms like [[Mitanni]], the [[Hittites]], and later the [[Assyria]]ns and [[Babylonians]], made it necessary for the Egyptians to conduct campaigns far from home. The next leap forwards came in the Late Period (712\u2013332 BC), when mounted troops and weapons made of iron came into use. After the conquest by [[Alexander the Great]], Egypt was heavily Hellenized and the main military force became the infantry [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]]. The ancient Egyptians were not great innovators in weapons technology, and most weapons technology innovation came from Western Asia and the Greek world.\n\nThese soldiers were paid with a plot of land for the provision of their families. After fulfilment of their service, the veterans were allowed retirement to these estates. Generals could become quite influential at the court, but unlike other feudal states, the Egyptian military was completely controlled by the king. Foreign mercenaries were also recruited; first Nubians ([[Medjay]]), and later also Libyans and Sherdens in the New Kingdom. By the Persian period Greek mercenaries entered service into the armies of the rebellious pharaohs. The Jewish mercenaries at [[Elephantine]] served the Persian overlords of Egypt in the 5th century BC. Although,  they might also have served the Egyptian Pharaohs of the 6th century BC.\n\nAs far as had been seen from the royal propaganda of the time, the king or the crown prince personally headed the Egyptian troops into battle. The army could number tens of thousands of soldiers, so the smaller battalions consisting of 250 men, led by an officer, may have been the key of command. The tactics involved a massive strike by archery followed by an infantry and/or chariotry attacking the broken enemy lines. The enemies could,  however, try to surprise the large Egyptian force with ambushes and by blocking the road as the Egyptian campaign records informs us.\n\nWithin the [[Nile]] valley itself, ships and barges were important military elements. Ships were vital for providing supplies for the troops. The Nile river had no fords so barges had to be used for river crossings. Dominating the river often proved necessary for prosecuting sieges, like the Egyptian conquest of the [[Hyksos]] capital [[Avaris]]. Egypt had no navy to fight naval battles at sea before the Late Period. However, a battle involving ships took place at the Egyptian coast in the 12th century BC between [[Ramesses III]] and seafaring raiders.\n\n==== Persia ====\n{{main|Military history of Iran}}\nAncient Persia first emerged as a major military power under [[Cyrus the Great]]. Its form of warfare was based on massed infantry in light armor to pin the enemy force whilst cavalry dealt the killing blow. Cavalry was used in huge numbers but it is not known whether they were heavily armored or not. Most Greek sources claim the Persians wore no armor, but we do have an example from Herodotus which claims that an unhorsed cavalry Officer wore a gold cuirass under his red robes. Chariots were used in the early days but during the later days of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] they were surpassed by horsemen. During the Persian Empire's height, they even possessed [[war elephants]] from North Africa and distant India. The elite of the Persian Army were the famous [[Persian Immortals]], a 10,000 strong unit of professional soldiers armed with a spear, a sword and a bow. Archers also formed a major component of the Persian Army.\n\nPersian tactics primarily had four stages involving archers, infantry and cavalry. The archers, which wielded longbows, would fire waves of arrows before the battle, attempting to cut the enemy numbers down prior battle. The cavalry would then attempt to run into the enemy and sever communications between generals and soldiers. Infantry would then proceed to attack the disoriented soldiers, subsequently weakened from the previous attacks.\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main|Military history of India}}\nDuring the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic period]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1500\u2013500 BC), the ''[[Vedas]]'' and other associated texts contain references to warfare. The earliest allusions to a specific battle are those to the  [[Battle of the Ten Kings]] in [[Mandala 7]] of the [[Rigveda]].\n\nThe two great ancient epics of [[India]], ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (c. 1000\u2013500 BC) are centered on conflicts and refer to military formations, theories of warfare and esoteric weaponry. [[Valmiki]]'s ''Ramayana'' describes [[Ayodhya]]'s military as defensive rather than aggressive. The city, it says, was strongly fortified and was surrounded by a deep moat. ''Ramayana'' describes Ayodhya in the following words: \"The city abounded in warriors undefeated in battle, fearless and chinskilled in the use of arms, resembling lions guarding their mountain caves\". ''Mahabharata'' describes various military techniques, including the ''[[Chakravyuha]]''.\n\nThe world's first recorded military application of [[war elephant]]s is in the Mahabharatha.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Asian Elephant: Ecology and Management|author=R. Sukumar|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993}}</ref> From India, war elephants were brought to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] where they were used in several campaigns. The Persian king [[Darius III]] employed about 50 Indian elephants in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] (331 BC) fought against Alexander the Great. In the [[Battle of the Hydaspes River]], the Indian king [[King Porus|Porus]], who ruled in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], with his smaller army of 200 war elephants, 2000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry, presented great difficulty for Alexander the Great's larger army of 4000 cavalry and 50,000 infantry, though Porus was eventually defeated. At this time, the [[Nanda Empire]] further east in [[North India|northern]] and [[East India|eastern]] India had an army of 6000 war elephants, 80,000 cavalry, 200,000 infantry and 8000 armed chariots.\n\n[[Chanakya]] (c. 350\u2013275 BC) was a professor of [[political science]] at [[Takshashila University]], and later the [[Prime Minister]] of emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of the [[Maurya Empire]]. Chanakya wrote the ''[[Arthashastra]]'', which covered various topics on ancient Indian warfare in great detail, including various techniques and strategies relating to war. These included the earliest uses of [[espionage]] and [[assassination]]s. These techniques and strategies were employed by Chandragupta Maurya, who was a student of Chanakya, and later by [[Ashoka]] (304\u2013232 BC).\n\nChandragupta Maurya conquered the Magadha Empire and expanded to all of northern India, establishing the Maurya Empire, which extended from the [[Arabian Sea]] to the [[Bay of Bengal]]. In 305 BC, Chandragupta defeated [[Seleucus I Nicator]], who ruled the [[Seleucid Empire]] and controlled most of the territories conquered by Alexander the Great. Seleucus eventually lost his territories in Southern Asia, including southern [[Afghanistan]], to Chandragupta. Seleucus exchanged territory west of the Indus for 500 war elephants and offered his daughter to Chandragupta. In this matrimonial alliance the enmity turned into friendship, and Seleucus' dispatched an ambassador, [[Megasthenes]], to the Mauryan court at [[Pataliputra]]. As a result of this treaty, the Maurya Empire was recognized as a great power by the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic World]], and the kings of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] sent their own ambassadors to his court. According to Megasthenes, Chandragupta Maurya built an army consisting of 30,000 cavalry, 9000 war elephants, and 600,000 infantry, which was the largest army known in the ancient world. Ashoka went on to expand the Maurya Empire to almost all of [[South Asia]], along with much of Afghanistan and parts of [[Iran|Persia]]. Ashoka eventually gave up on warfare after converting to [[Buddhism]].\n\n=== China ===\n{{main|Military history of China (pre-1911)}}\nAncient China during the [[Shang Dynasty]] was a Bronze Age society based on [[chariot]] armies. Archaeological study of Shang sites at [[Anyang]] have revealed extensive examples of chariots and bronze weapons. The overthrow of the Shang by the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] saw the creation of a feudal social order, resting militarily on a class of aristocratic chariot warriors (\u58eb).\n\nIn the [[Spring and Autumn period]], warfare increased exponentially. ''Zuo zhuan'' describes the wars and battles among the feudal lords during the period. Warfare continued to be stylised and ceremonial even as it grew more violent and decisive. The concept of military hegemon (\u9738) and his \"way of force\" (\u9738\u9053) came to dominate Chinese society. [[Sun Tzu]] created a book that still applies to today's modern armies, [[The Art of War]].\n\nFormations of the army can be clearly seen from the Terracotta Army of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first Emperor in the history of China to be successful in unification of different warring states. Light infantry acting as shock troops lead the army, followed by heavy infantry as the main body of the army. Wide usage of cavalry and chariots behind the heavy infantry also gave the Qin army an edge in battles against the other warring states.\n\nWarfare became more intense, ruthless and much more decisive during the [[Warring States period]], in which great social and political change was accompanied by the end of the system of chariot warfare and the adoption of mass infantry armies. Cavalry was also introduced from the northern frontier, despite the cultural challenge it posed for robe-wearing Chinese men.

It is perhaps unlikely that by 500 cavalry played an important military role anywhere south of Thessaly, where cavalry traditionally dominated, but there can be little doubt that there were aristocratic cavalrymen on the battlefields in some ...\"</ref> [[Hoplites]], Greek infantry, fought with a long spear and a large shield, the [[hoplon]] also called [[aspis]]. Light infantry (psiloi) [[peltasts]], served as skirmishers.\n\nDespite the fact that most Greek cities were well fortified (with the notable exception of [[Sparta]]) and Greek siege technology was not up to the task of breaching these fortifications by force, most land battles were pitched ones fought on flat-open ground. This was because of the limited period of service Greek soldiers could offer before they needed to return to their farms; hence, a decisive battle was needed to settle matters at hand. To draw out a city's defenders, its fields would be threatened with destruction, threatening the defenders with starvation in the winter if they did not surrender or accept battle.\n\nThis pattern of warfare was broken during the [[Peloponnesian War]], when [[Athens]]' command of the sea allowed the city to ignore the destruction of the Athenian crops by [[Sparta]] and her allies by shipping grain into the city from the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]. This led to a warfare style in which both sides were forced to engage in repeated raids over several years without reaching a settlement. It also made sea battle a vital part of warfare. Greek naval battles were fought between [[triremes]] \u2013 long  and speedy rowing ships which engaged the enemy by ramming and boarding actions.\n\n==== Hellenistic Era ====\n{{Main|Ancient Macedonian army|Hellenistic armies}}\nDuring the time of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] were regarded as the most complete well co-ordinated [[military]] force in the known world. Although they are best known for the achievements of [[Alexander the Great]], his father [[Philip II of Macedon]] created and designed the fighting force Alexander used in his conquests. Before this time and for centuries their military prowess was nowhere near that the [[sarissa]] [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] offered.\n\nHowever prior to the improvements made by [[Philip II of Macedon]] armies fought in the traditional manner of the Greeks; that of the [[hoplite]] [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]].\n\nPhilip provided his [[Macedon]]ian soldiers in the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] with [[sarissa]], a [[spear]] which was 4\u20136 meters in length. The sarissa, when held upright by the rear [[Rank (formation)|rank]]s of the phalanx (there were usually eight ranks), helped hide maneuvers behind the phalanx from the view of the enemy. When held horizontal by the front ranks of the phalanx, enemies could be run through from far away. The [[hoplite]] type troops were not abandoned,<ref name=\":4\" >Macedonian Warrior Alexander's elite infantryman, p. 41,{{ISBN|978-1-84176-950-9}},2006</ref> but were no longer the core of the army.\n\nIn 358 BC he met the [[Illyrians]] in battle with his reorganized Macedonian phalanx, and utterly defeated them. The Illyrians fled in panic, leaving the majority of their 9,000-strong army dead. The [[Ancient Macedonian military|Macedonian army]] invaded [[Illyria]] and conquered the southern Illyrian tribes.\n\nAfter the defeat of the [[Illyrians]], [[Macedon]]'s policy became increasingly aggressive. [[Paionia|Paeonia]] was already forcefully integrated into [[Macedon]] under [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]]'s rule. In 357 BC Philip broke the treaty with [[Athens]] and attacked [[Amphipolis]] which promised to surrender to the [[Athenians]] in exchange for the fortified town of [[Pydna]], a promise he didn't keep. The city fell back in the hands of [[Macedon]]ia after an intense [[siege]]. Then he secured possession over the [[Gold mining|gold mines]] of nearby [[Mount Pangaeus]], which would enable him to finance his future wars.\n\nIn 356 the Macedonian army advanced further eastward and captured the town of [[Crenides (Macedonia)|Crenides]] (near modern [[Drama, Greece|Drama]]) which was in the hands of the [[Thracians]], and which Philip renamed after himself to [[Philippi]]. The Macedonian eastern border with [[Thrace]] was now secured at the river [[Nestus]] (Mesta).\n\n[[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]] next marched against his southern enemies. In [[Thessaly]] he defeated his enemies and by 352, he was firmly in control of this region. The Macedonian [[army]] advanced as far as the pass of [[Thermopylae]] which divides [[Greece]] in two parts, but it did not attempt to take it because it was strongly guarded by a joint force of [[Athenians]], [[Sparta]]ns, and [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaeans]].\n\nHaving secured the bordering regions of [[Macedon]], [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]] assembled a large Macedonian army and marched deep into Thrace for a long conquering campaign. By 339 after defeating the Thracians in series of battles, most of [[Thrace]] was firmly in Macedonian hands save the most eastern [[Greece|Greek]] coastal cities of [[Byzantium]] and [[Perinthus]] who successfully withstood the long and difficult sieges. But both [[Byzantium]] and [[Perinthus]] would have surely fallen had it not been for the help they received from the various Greek city-states, and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] king himself, who now viewed the rise of [[Macedon]]ia and its eastern expansion with concern. Ironically, the Greeks invited and sided with the [[Persian people|Persians]] against the Macedonians, although Persia had been the nation hated the most by [[Greece]] for more than a century. The memory of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] invasion of [[Greece]] some 150 years ago was still alive, but the current politics for the Macedonians had put it aside.\n\nMuch greater would be the conquests of his son, [[Alexander the Great]], who would add to the phalanx a powerful [[cavalry]],  led by his elite [[Companion Cavalry|Companions]], and flexible, innovative formations and tactics.  He advanced [[Greece|Greek]] style of combat, and was able to muster large bodies of men for long periods of time for his campaigns against [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]].\n\n=== Iron Age Europe ===\n\n==== Roman Empire ====\n{{main|Military History of Rome|Roman infantry tactics, strategy and battle formations}}\nThe [[Roman army]] was the world's first professional army. It had its origins in the citizen army of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for Rome. The reforms of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] around 100 BC turned the army into a professional structure, still largely filled by citizens, but citizens who served continuously for 20 years before being discharged.\n\nThe Romans were also noted for making use of auxiliary troops, non-Romans who served with the legions and filled roles that the traditional Roman military could not fill effectively, such as light skirmish troops and heavy cavalry. Later in the Empire, these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman military. By the late Empire, tribes such as the [[Visigoths]] were bribed to serve as mercenaries.\n\nThe Roman navy was traditionally considered less important, although it remained vital for the transportation of supplies and troops, also during the great purge of pirates from the Mediterranean sea by Pompey the Great in the 1st century BC. Most of Rome's battles occurred on land, especially when the Empire was at its height and all the land around the [[Mediterranean]] was controlled by Rome.\n\nBut there were notable exceptions. The [[First Punic War]], a pivotal war between Rome and Carthage in the 3rd century BC, was largely a naval conflict. And the naval [[Battle of Actium]] established the Roman empire under [[Augustus]].\n\n==== Balkans ====\n{{Main|Illyrian warfare}}\n\nThe Illyrian king [[Bardyllis]] turned part of south [[Illyria]] into a formidable local power in the 4th century BC. He managed to become king of the [[Dardanians (Balkans)|Dardanians]]<ref>Borza, Eugene N. In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon, 1990, p. 180, {{ISBN|0-691-00880-9}}.

However their power was weakened by bitter rivalries and jealousy. The army was composed by [[peltast]]s with a variety of weapons.\n {{Main|Thracian warfare}}\nThe [[Thracians]] fought as [[peltast]]s using [[javelins]] and crescent or round wicker shields.Missile weapons were favored but close combat weaponry was carried by the Thracians as well. These close combat weapons varied from the dreaded [[Rhomphaia]] & [[Falx]]\nto [[spear]]s and swords. Thracians shunned armor and greaves and fought as light as possible favoring mobility above all other traits and had excellent horsemen.<ref>The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC (Hardcover)\nby John Boardman (Editor), I.

They established a highly [[militarized]] society and, during the periods when the tribes were united under one [[Monarch|king]] (82\u201344 BC, 86\u2013106) posed a major threat to the [[Roman province]]s of Lower [[Danube]]. Dacia was conquered and transformed into a Roman province in 106 after a long, hard [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|war]].\n\n==== Celtic ====\n{{main|Celtic warfare}}\n{{further|Gallic Wars|Gaelic warfare}}\n\n[[Endemic warfare|Tribal warfare]] appears to have been a regular feature of [[Celts|Celtic societies]]. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some instances to conquer territory.\n\nThe Celts were described by classical writers such as  [[Strabo]], [[Livy]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], and [[Florus]] as fighting like \"wild beasts\", and as hordes. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] said that their \"manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in [[military science]]. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of [[Boar|wild boars]], throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all\".<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus,  ''Roman Antiquities''\np. 259 Excerpts from Book XIV</ref> Such descriptions have been challenged by contemporary historians.<ref>{{cite book\n|author=Ellis, Peter Berresford\n|title= ''The Celts: A History''\n|pages= 60\u201363\n|publisher=Caroll & Graf\n|year= 1998\n|isbn= 0-7867-1211-2}}</ref> Caesar himself describes the Gauls as forming phalanxes (likely similar to the medieval shieldwall) and testudos in battle, and using spears as their main weapon, as opposed to swords.\n\n==== Germanic ====\n[[File:Praying Germanic man 1890.jpg|right|thumb|Roman bronze figurine depicting a Germanic man adorned with a [[Suebian knot]] engaged in prayer. (Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris)]]\n{{further|Germanic Wars|Gothic warfare|Anglo-Saxon warfare|Migration period spear}}\nHistorical records of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] in [[Germania]] east of the [[Rhine]] and west of the [[Danube]] do not begin until quite late in the ancient period, so only the period after 100 BC can be examined. What is clear is that the Germanic idea of warfare was quite different from the pitched battles fought by [[Rome]] and [[Greece]]. Instead the Germanic tribes focused on raids.\n\nThe purpose of these was generally not to gain territory, but rather to capture resources and secure prestige. These raids were conducted by [[irregular military|irregular troops]], often formed along family or village lines. Leaders of unusual personal magnetism could gather more soldiers for longer periods, but there was no systematic method of gathering and training men, so the death of a charismatic leader could mean the destruction of an army. Armies also often consisted of more than 50 percent noncombatants, as displaced people would travel with large groups of soldiers, the elderly, women, and children.\n\nThough often defeated by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], the Germanic tribes were remembered in Roman records as fierce combatants, whose main downfall was that they failed to unite successfully into one fighting force, under one [[Command (military formation)|command]].<ref name=\"Tacitus\">Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#45|2.45]]</ref>  After the three [[Roman legion]]s were ambushed and destroyed by an alliance of Germanic tribes headed by [[Arminius]] at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in 9 AD, the Roman Empire made no further concentrated attempts at conquering Germania beyond the Rhine. Prolonged warfare against the Romans accustomed the Germanic tribes to improved tactics such as the use of reserves, military discipline and centralised command.<ref <ref name=\"Tacitus\"/> Germanic tribes would eventually overwhelm and conquer the ancient world, giving rise to modern Europe and medieval warfare. For an analysis of Germanic tactics versus the Roman empire see [[Roman infantry tactics#Roman infantry versus Gallic and the Germanic tribes|tactical problems in facing the Gauls and the Germanic tribes]]\n\n=== Japanese ===\n{{main|Military history of Japan}}\nHorses and bows were very important in Japan, and were used in warfare from very early times, as shown in statues and artifacts found in tombs of early chieftains. Samurai eventually became very skilled in using the horse. Because their main weapon at this time was the bow and arrow, early samurai exploits were spoken of in Japanese war tales as the \u201cWay of the Horse and Bow.\u201d Horse and bow combined was a battlefield advantage to the early samurai. A bunch of arrows made of mainly wood with poison tipped points were worn on a warrior's right side so he could quickly knock and release an arrow mid-gallop.\n\nAlthough they weren't as important as the bow, swords of various sizes and types were also part of an early samurai's armory. They were mostly for close quarters engagements. Many different kinds of spears were also used. One, the [[naginata]], was a curved blade fixed to the end of a pole several feet long. This was known as a 'woman's spear' because samurai girls were taught to use it from an early age. A device called the kumade, which resembled a long-handled garden rake, was used to catch the clothing or helmet of enemy horsemen and unseat them.\n\nCommon samurai archers had armor made of lamellae pieces laced together with colorful cords. The lightweight armor allowed for greater freedom of movement, faster speed, and reduced fatigue for horse and rider.\n\nThe early [[Yamato period]] had seen a continual engagement in the Korean Peninsula until Japan finally withdrew, along with the remaining forces of the [[Baekje]] Kingdom. Several battles occurred in these periods as the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor's]] succession gained importance. By the [[Nara period]], [[Honsh\u016b]] was completely under the control of the [[Yamato (people)|Yamato]] clan. Near the end of the [[Heian period]], [[samurai]] became a powerful political force, thus starting the feudal period.\n\n== Notable ancient wars ==\n* [[Medo-Babylonian war against Assyrian Empire]]\n* [[Ionian Revolt]]\n:The '''Ionian Revolt''' was a series of conflicts between the [[Ionia]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] that began 499 BC and lasted until 493 BC. The revolt begins because of Athens's offensive attack to the city of Sardis and massacring the Persian citizens by burning down the city. This revolt had a major role in starting the Greco-Persian wars.\n* [[Greco-Persian Wars]]\n:The '''Greco-Persian Wars''' were a series of conflicts between the [[Ancient Greece|Greek City-States]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] that began around 500 BC and lasted until 448 BC.\n* [[Peloponnesian War]]\n:The '''Peloponnesian War''' was begun in 431 BC between the [[Athenian Empire]] and the [[Peloponnesian League]] which included [[Sparta]] and [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]]. The war was documented by [[Thucydides]], an Athenian general, in his work ''[[The History of The Peloponnesian War]]''. The war lasted 27 years, with a brief truce in the middle.\n* [[Wars of Alexander the Great]].\n:King Alexander the III of Macedonia throughout his entire reign from 336 to 321 B.C embarked on a '''campaign of conquest of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]'''. Starting from modern day Western Turkey Alexander the Great conquered the entirety of Egypt, the Middle East, Iran and parts of India and Central Asia. Never losing a battle Alexander expanded the boundaries of the known world to the [[Hellenistic period|Greek World]] at the time. With an untimely death his successors fought over the territories they had conquered. However, due to Alexander the Great Greek culture and technology spread into Asia for centuries to come. \n* [[Kalinga War]] (265\u2013264 BC) was a war fought between the [[Mauryan Empire]] under [[Ashoka]] and the state of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]], a feudal [[republic]] located on the coast of the present-day [[India]]n state of [[Odisha]]. Ashoka's response to the Kalinga War is recorded in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]]. According to some of these (Rock Edict XIII and Minor Rock Edict I), the Kalinga War prompted Ashoka, already a non-engaged Buddhist, to devote the rest of his life to [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence) and to Dhamma-Vijaya (victory through [[Dhamma]]).\n*[[Qin's wars of unification]]\n:'''Qin's wars of unification were''' a series of military campaigns launched in the late 3rd century BC by the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] against the other [[Seven Warring States|six major states]] \u2013 [[Han (state)|Han]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]] and [[Qi (state)|Qi]] \u2013 within the territories that formed modern [[China]]. By the end of the wars in 221 BC, Qin had unified most of the states and occupied some lands south of the [[Yangtze River]]. The territories conquered by Qin served as the foundation of the [[Qin dynasty|Qin Empire]].\n* [[Punic Wars]]\n:'''The Punic Wars''' were a series of three wars fought between [[Rome]] and the city of [[Carthage]] (a [[Phoenicia]]n descendant). They are known as the \"Punic\" Wars because Rome's name for Carthaginians was ''Punici'' (older ''Poeni'', due to their Phoenician ancestry). They determined that the Romans would control the Mediterranean Sea and led to the eventual rise of the greater [[Roman Empire]] across Europe, Asia and Africa.\n# The [[First Punic War]] was primarily a naval war fought between 264 BC and 241 BC.\n# The [[Second Punic War]] is famous for [[Hannibal]]'s crossing of the [[Alps]] and was fought between 218 BC and 202 BC.\n# The [[Third Punic War]] resulted in the destruction of Carthage and was fought between 149 BC and 146 BC.\n\n* [[Roman-Persian Wars]]\n:The '''Roman&ndash;Persian Wars''' were a series of conflicts between states of the [[Greco-Roman world]] and two successive [[Greater Iran|Iranian empires]]: the Parthian and the Sassanid. Battles between the [[Parthian Empire]] and the [[Roman Republic]] began in 92&nbsp;BC;  wars began under the late Republic, and continued through the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid empire]]s. They were ended by the [[Muslim conquests|Arab Muslim invasions]], which devastated the Sassanid and [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine East Roman]] empires shortly after the end of the last war between them.\n\n*[[Han\u2013Xiongnu War]]\n:The '''Han\u2013Xiongnu War''',<ref name=wu5-71>{{Harvnb|Wu|2013|loc=71}}.</ref> also known as the '''Sino-Xiongnu War''',<ref name=\"ZaidanSent\u01012007\">{{cite book|author1=Nara Shiruku R\u014ddo-haku Kinen Kokusai K\u014dry\u016b Zaidan|author2=Shiruku R\u014ddo-gaku Kenky\u016b Sent\u0101|title=Opening up the Silk Road: the Han and the Eurasian world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YfVwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2 February 2013|year=2007|publisher=Nara International Foundation Commemorating the Silk Road Exposition|isbn=978-4-916071-61-3|page=23}}</ref> was a series of military battles fought between the Chinese [[Han Dynasty|Han empire]] and the [[Xiongnu]] confederated state located in modern day Mongolia from 133 BC to 89 AD. The final wars resulted in the final destruction of the [[Xiongnu]] as a political entity in Siberia. China would temporally enjoy peace on its northern frontier before new peoples such as the [[Xianbei]] took the role of the [[Xiongnu]].\n\n* [[Germanic Wars|Roman-Germanic Wars]]\n:The''' Germanic Wars''' is a name given to a large series of military engagements between the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and various [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] between 113 BC and AD 596. The nature of these wars varied through time between Roman conquest, Germanic uprisings and later Germanic invasions in the Roman Empire that started in the late 2nd century.

In [[Europe]] and the [[Near East]], the end of antiquity is often equated with the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Fall of Rome]] in 476 AD, the wars of the Eastern Roman Empire on its Southwestern Asian and North African borders, and the beginnings of the [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century. In [[China]], it can also be seen as ending of the growing role of mounted warriors needed to counter the ever-growing threat from the north in the 5th century and the beginning of the [[Tang dynasty]] in 618 AD. In [[Indian subcontinent|India]], the ancient period ends with the decline of the [[Gupta Empire]] (6th century) and the beginning of the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquests there]] from the 8th century. In [[Japan]], the ancient period is considered to end with the rise of [[feudalism]] in the [[Kamakura period]] in the 12\u201313th century.\n\nThe difference between [[Prehistoric warfare|prehistoric]] and ancient warfare is more organization oriented than technology oriented. The development of first [[city-state]]s, and then [[empire]]s, allowed warfare to change dramatically. Beginning in [[Mesopotamia]], [[State (polity)|states]] produced sufficient agricultural surplus. This allowed full-time ruling elites and military commanders to emerge. While the bulk of military forces were still farmers, the society could support having them campaigning rather than working the land for a portion of each year. Thus, organized armies developed for the first time.\n\nThese new armies we able to help states grow in size and become increasingly centralized. Early ancient armies continued to primarily use [[bow and arrow|bows]] and [[spear]]s, the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting. The findings at the site of [[Nataruk]] in [[Turkana County|Turkana]], Kenya, have been interpreted as evidence of inter-group conflict and warfare in antiquity,<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Inter-group violence among early Holocene hunter-gatherers of West Turkana, Kenya|journal = Nature|pages = 394\u201398|volume = 529|issue = 7586|doi = 10.1038/nature16477|first = M.

The infantries at this time would be divided into ranged and shock, with shock infantry either charging to cause penetration of the enemy line or hold their own. These forces would ideally be combined, thus presenting the opponent with a dilemma: group the forces and leave them vulnerable to ranged, or spread them out and make them vulnerable to shock. This balance would eventually change as technology allowed for chariots, cavalry, and artillery to play an active role on the field.\n\nNo clear line can be drawn between ancient and [[medieval warfare]]. The characteristic properties of medieval warfare, notably [[heavy cavalry]] and [[Medieval siege weaponry|siege engines]] such as the [[trebuchet]] were first introduced in [[Late Antiquity]]. The main division within the ancient period is at the beginning [[Iron Age]] with the introduction of [[cavalry]] (resulting in the decline of [[chariot warfare]]), of [[naval warfare]] ([[Sea Peoples]]), and the development of an industry based on [[ferrous metallurgy]] which allowed for the mass production of metal weapons and thus the equipment of large standing armies.\nThe first military power to profit from these innovations was the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], which achieved a [[List of largest empires#Ancient empires|hitherto unseen]] extent of centralized control, the first \"[[world power]]\" to extend over the entire [[Fertile Crescent]] ([[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]).\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Chariots ==\n{{main|Chariot}}\nAs states grew in size, speed of being able to mobilize became crucial because central power could not hold if rebellions could not be suppressed rapidly. The first solution to this was the [[chariot]] which was initially used in the [[Middle East]] from around 1800 BC. First pulled by [[oxen]] and [[donkey]]s, they allowed rapid traversing of the relatively flat lands of the Middle East. The chariots were light enough that they could easily be floated across rivers. Improvements in the ability to train [[horse]]s soon allowed them to be used to pull chariots, possibly as early as 2100 BC,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kuznetsov | first1 = P.F. | year = 2006 | title = The emergence of Bronze Age chariots in eastern Europe | url = | journal = Antiquity | volume = 80 | issue = 309| pages = 638\u201345 | doi=10.1017/s0003598x00094096}}</ref> and their greater speed and power made chariots even more efficient. The major limitation of the use of chariots was terrain; while very mobile on flat, hard, open ground, it was very difficult if not impossible to make any head way through more bumpy terrain. Bumpy terrain being; rough ground, even sparse trees or bushes, small ravines or streams, or marsh. In these terrains chariots were surpassed in maneuverability by common foot soldiers, and later by [[cavalry]].\n\nThe power of the chariot as a device both of transportation and of warfare became the central weapon of the peoples of the [[Ancient Near East]] in the 2nd millennium BC. The typical chariot was worked by two men: one would be a bowman who would fire at enemy forces, while the other would control the vehicle. Over time, chariots were developed to be able to carry up to five warriors. In [[China]], [[Chariot (Ancient China)|their chariots]] became the central weapon of the [[Shang dynasty]], allowing them to unify a great area.\n \nAlthough chariots have been compared to modern-day [[tank]]s in the role they played on the battlefield, i.e., [[shock attack]]s, this is disputed<ref>{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Alan B.|title=A Companion to Ancient Egyp|year=2010|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-5598-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RK2pLin2sPAC&pg=PA438&dq=egyptian+chariots+tanks#v=onepage&q=%20%20chariots%20tanks&f=false|page=438}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Drews|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Drews|title=The end of the Bronze Age: changes in warfare and the catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C|year=1995|edition=new|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02591-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&pg=PA121&dq=egyptian+chariots+tanks#v=onepage&q=%20%20tank&f=false|page=221}}</ref> with scholars pointing out that chariots were vulnerable and fragile, required a level terrain while tanks are all-terrain vehicles, and thus not suitable for use in the way modern tanks have been used as a physical shock force.<ref>{{cite book|last=Littauer|first=M.A.|title=Wheeled vehicles and ridden animals in the ancient Near East|year=1979|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-05953-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TcoUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA98&dq=ancient+near+east+chariots++tanks#v=onepage&q=ancient%20near%20east%20chariots%20%20tanks&f=false|author2=J.

Because tightly packed infantry were the formation of choice, in order for ancient generals to maintain [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] during the battle as well as for mutual protection. A force of chariots could stand off at long range and rain arrows down on the infantrymen's heads. Because of their speed, any attempts to charge the chariots could be easily evaded. If, on the other hand, an infantry unit spread out to minimize the damage from arrows, they would lose the benefit of mutual protection and the charioteers could easily overrun them.\n\nFrom a tactical standpoint this put any force facing chariots into a tactical dilemma, making chariots indispensable to armies of those times. Chariots, however, were complicated pieces of hardware that required specialized craftsmen to maintain them. Such services, therefore, made chariots expensive to own. When chariots were owned by individuals within a society, it tended to give rise to a warrior class of specialists and a [[feudal system]] (an example of which can be seen in [[Homer]]'s [[The Iliad]]). Where chariots were publicly owned, they helped in the maintenance and establishment of a strong central government, e.g., the [[New Kingdom|New Egyptian Kingdom]]. Chariot usage peaked in the [[Battle of Kadesh]] in 1274 BC, which was probably the largest chariot battle ever fought, involving perhaps 5,000 chariots.<ref name=\"Parragon\">{{cite book|author=Dr. Aaron Ralby|title=Atlas of Military History|url=https://archive.org/details/atlasofworldmili0000ralb|url-access=registration|year=2013|publisher=Parragon|isbn=978-1-4723-0963-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/atlasofworldmili0000ralb/page/54 54\u201355]|chapter=Battle of Kadesh, c. 1274 BCE: Clash of Empires}}</ref>\n\n== Naval warfare ==\n{{main|Naval warfare}}\nNaval warfare in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]] can be traced back to the third millennium BC Mediterranean as evidence of paintings on Cyclades and models of ships were being made across the Aegean.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Essays and Reflections: Naval Warfare in the Ancient World: Myths and Realities|last=Lazenby|first=J.F.|publisher=Taylor & Francis, Ltd.|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=438}}</ref> Ships in this era have been said to have served as both ordinary transportation and trade vessels as well as having some military and warfare applications. These early sea vessels would have been propelled by both [[oar]] and [[sail]], but since the [[Mediterranean]] is known for its inconsistent weather patterns, the oar would have most likely been the primary means of propulsion.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first documented, physical evidence of a naval battle is found in the relief painting located in the temple of Medinet Habu, near Luxor, Egypt. This relief painting depicts the victory of Ramses III over the 'Sea-Peoples' at the Nile river delta in the early twelfth century BC.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essays and Reflections: Naval Warfare in the Ancient World: Myths and Realities.|last=Lazenby|first=J.F.|publisher=Taylor & Francis, Ltd.|year=1987|isbn=|location=|page=439}}</ref> These 'Sea-Peoples' are originally believed to be of Philistine and Phoenician descent, while there is speculation that there could be some Greek influence in their sea-faring. While the relief painting at the Temple of [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]] is said to be the first physical documentation of naval warfare, there are earlier records that indicate that the concept and practice of sea-faring battles sprouted up as early as 2550 BC under the Egyptian Pharaoh Sahue who reportedly used transport vessels to escort his armies to foreign shores.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ancient Mariners: Seafarers and Sea Fighters of the Mediterranean in Ancient Times.|last=Casson|first=Lionel|publisher=Brett-Macmillan, Ltd.|year=1959|isbn=|location=New York|page=27}}</ref> There is even further evidence from earlier sources that illustrate sea faring and military action around the Nile Delta during the early dynastic period in Egypt following into the reign of Ramses II <ref>{{Cite book|title=Egyptian Warfare and Weapons|last=Shaw|first=Ian|publisher=Shire Publications, Ltd.|year=1991|isbn=|location=Buckinghamshire, U.K.|pages=59\u201360}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the victory of Ramses III over the 'Sea-Peoples', Egypt, as a sovereign state, did not have access to the kind of timber needed to manufacture seafaring vessels and warships alike on a large scale. Instead of importing mass amounts of timber in order to build warships, Egyptian naval architects and early engineers began to convert the common river-going ships. They re-configuring the size of the ship while also adding heavy trees for longitudinal support of the hull on the open sea.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stieglitz|first=Robert R.|date=1984|title=Long-Distance Seafaring in the Ancient Near East|journal=The Biblical Archaeologist|volume= 47| issue =  3|pages=136\u201337|jstor=3209914}}</ref>\n\nThis newly theorized concept of rearranging and re-configuring the common Egyptian river boat was held in high esteem and largely contributed to the victory of [[Ramesses III]] over the 'Sea-Peoples' in the Nile river delta as depicted in the relief painting at Medinet Habu.

The first depiction of this 'longship' style vessel can be found in Homer's ''The Iliad'' as a means of transport of armed men and supplies to areas of conflict across the seas.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship|last=Morrison |last2=Coates |last3=Rankov|first=J.S. |first2=J.F. |first3=N.B. |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Great Britain|page=25}}</ref> These ships were said to have consisted of two separate levels that could have help up to 60 men per level, all operating oars in unison to propel the ship. The upper level of oarsmen would sit in single-file fashion, pulling their oars through what is called a top wale or some sort of oar-port; while the men in the lower rows would sit in the ships' hold also rowing through lower oar-ports.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship|last=Morrison |last2=Coates |last3=Rankov|first=J.S. |first2=J.F. |first3=N.B. |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Great Britain|pages=31\u201332}}</ref> It is also said that each oar throughout the ship would be made in length proportionate to the physique of an average Greek man.<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Model of a greek trireme.jpg|thumb|reconstruction of ancient Greek Trireme]]\nManned crews for these massive warships would have been quite impressive, but accounts vary in actual numbers of men from source to source. [[Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] was a Greek historian in the fourth century BC who, through his accounts, said that these Triremes would consist of at least two-hundred men manning all positions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship|last=Morrison |last2=Coates |last3=Rankov|first=J.S. |first2=J.F. |first3=N.B. |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Great Britain|page=107}}</ref> With these massive crews, these ships were able to work at maximum capacity and efficiency in regards to speed, navigation, and transport. While these ships were built for maximum efficiency, there is room for debate about the conditions and space aboard the ship itself. It is estimated that out of the 200 man crew, around 170 of those men would have been oarsmen with respective positions below deck.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship|last=Morrison |last2=Coates |last3=Rankov|first=J.S. |first2=J.F. |first3=N.B. |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Great Britain|page=131}}</ref> These oarsmen below deck would sit on thwarts and kept their personal storage items beneath them, reassuring the theory that these ships would be very crowded with little room for anything other than operational functions.\n\nWhat exactly these Greek triremes were capable of in battle is debated. There are various different accounts that lay down foundations of what equipment was used and how these ships engaged in combat. The main military applications of Greek Triremes, besides the transport of troops and supplies, would be the advantages of ramming tactics.  Developments and innovations of the Greek Trireme evolved over time, especially in respects to ramming tactics. Naval architects during this time saw fit to bring about full effectiveness and damaging power to these ships. By doing this, the amount of manpower would stay consistent, i.e., keeping the same amount of rowing power but shortening the length of the ship to condense the ramming power while keeping speed and agility consistent.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship|last=Morrison |last2=Coates |last3=Rankov|first=J.S. |first2=J.F. |first3=N.B. |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Great Britain|page=30}}</ref> This new ideology of warfare and naval tactics would prove to be prudent to the overall military applications of the Trireme, and soon would become the principal combative strategy of the Greek navy and other navies alike.\n\nThe Greek Trireme, soon after its appearance in the Aegean, would become the standard warship throughout the Mediterranean as sovereign states such as Egypt and even the Persian Empire would adopt the design of these ships and apply them to their own military applications. One major attraction of the Greek design was not only its efficient ramming capability but also its ability to travel long distances at fair speeds. One account from the Athenian soldier and historian Xenophon describes the voyage of the Athenian fleet commander Iphicrates through unfriendly waters and the strategy he used combined with the sheer sailing power of the Trireme. <blockquote>\"He proceeded with his journey and at the same time made all the necessary preparations for action, at the outset leaving his main sails behind as if he was expecting an engagement. In addition, even if there was a following wind he used his small [boat] sails little, but progressed by oar [instead, presumably, of using main sails and boat sails when the wind was favourable]. Thus he both improved the fitness of his men and achieved a higher speed for his ships\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship|last=Morrison |last2=Coates |last3=Rankov|first=J.S. |first2=J.F. |first3=N.B. |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Great Britain|page=97}}</ref></blockquote>This primary source account can be interpreted as a functional and efficient use of the Greek trireme. Maximizing its speed through rugged and unfriendly seas while also utilizing specific military strategy in order to ensure the most prudent and effective outcome was what led to the success of the trireme across all kinds of empires and civilizations throughout the Mediterranean. The trireme would later become a vital piece of naval weaponry throughout the Persian Wars, for both the Greeks and the Persian Empire, as well as the base standard for the formation of the Roman Navy.\n\nThe [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian Wars]] were the first to feature large-scale naval operations: not only sophisticated fleet engagements with dozens of [[trireme]]s on each side, but also combined land\u2013sea operations. Ships in the ancient world could operate only on the relatively quiet waters of seas and rivers; the oceans were off limits. Navies were almost always used as auxiliaries to land forces, often essential to bringing them supplies. They would rarely strike out on their own. With only limited-range weapons, naval galleys would often attempt to ram their opponents with their reinforced bow to cause damage or sink the enemy warships which often caused the two ships to become joined together, and initiated a boarding battle. Only occasionally was a decisive naval battle fought, such as the [[Battle of Lade]] in which a Persian navy destroyed the Greek navy.\n\n== Tactics and weapons ==\n\n=== Strategy ===\nAncient strategy focused broadly on the twin goals of convincing the enemy that continued war was more costly than submitting, and of making the most gain possible from war.\n\nForcing the enemy to submit generally consisted of defeating their army in the field. Once the enemy force was routed, the threat of siege, civilian deaths, and the like often forced the enemy to the bargaining table. However, this goal could be accomplished by other means. Burning enemy fields would force the choice of surrendering or fighting a [[pitched battle]]. Waiting an enemy out until their army had to disband due to the beginning of the harvest season or running out of payment for mercenaries presented an enemy with a similar choice. The exceptional conflicts of the ancient world were when these rules of warfare were violated. The Spartan and Athenian refusal to accept surrender after many years of war and near bankruptcy in the [[Peloponnesian War]] is one such exceptional example, as is the Roman refusal to surrender after the [[Battle of Cannae]].\n\nA more personal goal in war was simple profit. This profit was often monetary, as was the case with the raiding culture of the Gallic tribes. But the profit could be political, as great leaders in war were often rewarded with government office after their success. These strategies often contradict modern common sense as they conflict with what would be best for the states involved in the war.\n\n=== Tactics ===\n{{Main|Military Tactics}}\nEffective tactics varied greatly, depending on:\n# The army's size\n# Unit types\n# Terrain\n# The weather\n# Positional advantage\n# Skill level\n# Individual battle experience\n# Individual morale\n# Armament (quantity and quality)\n\n=== Weapons ===\n{{main|List of ancient weapons}}\nAncient weapons included the [[spear]], the [[atlatl]] with light javelin or similar projectile, the [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and arrow, the [[Sling (weapon)|sling]]; [[polearm]]s such as the [[spear]], [[falx]] and [[pilum|javelin]]; hand-to-hand weapons such as [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, [[Club (weapon)|clubs]], [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s, [[axe]]s, and [[knife|knives]]. [[Catapult]]s, [[siege tower]]s, and [[battering ram]]s were used during [[siege]]s.\n\nThere were a wide variety and range of weapons used in the wars and battles of times long past and while it is quite easy to identify a sword or shield and know what purpose it served, even more information can be gained from knowing where said weapon comes from and what material it is made of. Ancient Greece is one of the most looked to and studied periods of time in part due the abundance of surviving information and artifacts and this aspect can also be extended to their weaponry and armor. The Mycenaean left behind a great deal of their weapons and armor which was found in their shaft graves, in ''Arms and Armour of the Greeks'' the swords found within the Mycenaean tombs are quite similar to rapiers being quite slender and measuring in at over three feet in length. It was due to their length and slim design that they were easily broken if struck hard enough. In addition to the rapier swords, smaller yet more durable blades were found along with a few spearheads which often came in at over two feet in length; however, the spearheads were not quite as abundant as other bladed weapons as Snodgrass states that their value and use in war and hunting was too significant to spare for graves. Prior to the Bronze Age the Mycenaean helmets were constructed from crescent shaped sections of wild boar tusk and arranged in horizontal bands that alternated in direction and attached to a soft material.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Arms and Armour of the Greeks|last=Snodgrass|first=A.M.|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1967|isbn=|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=}}</ref> The soldiers\u2019 shields were around four feet tall, if not more, made of ox hide and supported with some type of metal. As we move into the Bronze Age body armor began to appear as the smiths began working with this new metal, bronze helmets also began to make an appearance though the previous helmets made from boars\u2019 tusks still remained in use. It was during this period that two new types of swords made a debut, they were the horned and cruciform swords. The horned sword was dubbed as such from the horn-like appearance of their hand guards and was the preferred weapon for a cutting stroke. The cruciform sword was derived and enhanced from a Minoan dagger with flanges on the hilt with rounded, right angle hand guards is how it is described within ''Arms and Armour'' . Spears continued to remain as the preferred means for a thrusting weapon, but it was during the Palace Period that they developed a socketed base. In earlier periods of Greek history, the bow and arrow was not a favored weapon for war but used primarily in hunting though in the Palace Period archery began to prosper \u2013 the arrowheads of both time periods were made of flint, bronze, or obsidian \u2013 while the bows of the Palace Period were made of goats\u2019 horn is how Snodgrass depicts the use of archery. From the Palace Period, we move into the Late Period of Mycenae where the weapons became shorter and more suited for use in a work environment rather than in battle and the metal plated armor was no longer being put to use.\n\nMacedon was known more traditionally for having a strong cavalry rather than infantry and during Alexander's reign the Sarissophori came into being and this was unique Alexander's time in power. While the cavalry was more prominent the Macedon infantry, made up of the poor and peasant classes, formed into a new and unique branch of the military that was different from the hoplite. These warriors were armed with a huge pike weapon called a sarissa as well as the army being equipped with slings. The slings used almond-shaped bronze bullets that were engraved with either Philip's or his generals\u2019 name and as for siege warfare the Macedonians used an arrow-firing catapult.<ref name=\":2\" /> For armor, they were equipped with a metal helmet, greaves, and a shield covered with bronze.\n\nIn ''The Archaeology of Weapons'' a broader account of ancient weaponry is taken into account through the investigation of European weapons. Oakeshott believes that at some point between 1500\u2013100 BC that the sword developed from the knife in both Minoan Crete and Celtic Britain and strongly resembles the rapiers. During the Bronze Age in the same general region several other swords were developed: the Hallstatt first appeared during this Age but did not become widely used until the Iron Age, the Carps Tongues, and the Rhone Valley swords. The Hallstatt swords gained prominence during the Iron Age and were a long sword with a rather curious point that was one of three shapes: rounded, a square shape, or similar to a fishtail, and were the preferred weapon for use in a chariot. The Carps Tongues blade were also rather large swords with the edges running parallel for two-thirds of the blade before narrowing to the usually point. The last sword is that of the Rhone Valley and is generally considered more of small sword or an overly large dagger with each hilt uniquely cast in bronze. The pommel of this type of dagger has the ends drawn out into two thin points that curve in towards the blade. Along with Hallstatt swords there were found to be spears, similar to the spearheads found in Mycenae they were quite large at fifteen inches and having a hollow socket however they were unique in that they had a small collar of bronze near where they attached to the shaft.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Archaeology of Weapons|last=Oakeshott|first=Ewart|publisher=Boydell Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK|pages=}}</ref>\n\nWithin India's long history there are several different regimes that produced unique weapons. The list of weapons primarily used in India are the battle axe, the bow and arrow, spears, spike, barbed dart, the sword, iron club, javelin, iron arrow, and the scimitar.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Arms and Armour Traditional Weapons of India|last=Jaiwant|first=Paul E.|publisher=Roli and Janssen|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> One sword type is the katar blade, these are equipped with sword breaking bars and both the shape and size would depend on whether the bearer was cavalry or an infantryman. A curved sword such as the talwar or shamsheer was ideal for a cutting motion delivered from horseback. There were three early iron sword types being the leaf shaped, spoon shaped and the parallel sword each ideal for thrusting and jabbing as opposed to a striking or cutting motion. The Rajputs, Gurkhas, Nagas, and Coorg and Malabar each developed a weapon unique to themselves. The Rajputs wielded the khanda which is a broad and straight sword with a wider point. The Gurkhas had two swords that they preferred to use the kukri, a short sword that angled towards wide tip, and the kora, their historical war sword which was around 60 centimeters with a single edge that was rather narrow near the handler and curving towards the front.<ref name=\":3\" /> The daos had a blade equal to two feet in length that had a wide and square-like tip and the handle was made of either wood or ivory, these were the weapons that came to popularity for the Nagas. The adya katti was a single edged blade also near two feet long but with no handle and wield by the Coorg and Malabar. In Southern India, the Borobudur and the Veragal, either shaped like a hook or a wavy design, were the swords in use. A rather unique weapon used in India is the Baghnakh which are similar to a knuckle duster and were used to slit the opponent's throat or belly.\n\nArmor in India can be found dating back to 500 BC and Vedic literature; there are several different types: leather and fabric, scale, brigandine, lamellar, mail, plate, and a combination of mail and plate.<ref name=\":3\" /> In ''Arms and Armour: Traditional Weapons of India'' it is read that the wrastrana, a breast plate, has been in use since prehistoric times though the most popular is the char-aina meaning four mirrors is a coat of mail overlaid with four elaborately designed plates. The helmets consisted of a sliding nose guard with a piece of chainmail hanging from it designed to protect the neck and shoulders. Armor was not just limited to human soldiers but extended to their horses and elephants as well. The horse armor was made up of mail and plates or lamellae which covered the neck, chest, and hindquarters underneath which was some form of padding to keep it in place while a face plate protected the animal's face. The elephants, used as a battering ram or to break and trample enemy lines, were also donned in armor for battle. The elephant's head was covered by a steel mask and covered half of the trunk while the throat and sides were protected by lamellae armor while the tusks were tipped with sharp metal.\n\n=== Sieges ===\n{{main|Siege}}\n[[File:Ramesseum siege of Dapur.jpg|thumb|The Egyptian [[siege of Dapur]] in the 13th century BC, from [[Ramesseum]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].]]\n\nSiege warfare of the [[ancient Near East]] took place behind walls built of mud bricks, stone, wood or a combination of these materials depending on local availability. The earliest representations of siege warfare date to the [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt]], c. 3000 BC, while the first siege equipment is known from Egyptian tomb reliefs of the 24th century BC showing wheeled siege ladders. [[Assyria]]n palace reliefs of the 9th to 7th centuries BC display sieges of several Near Eastern cities. Though a simple battering ram had come into use in the previous millennium, the Assyrians improved siege warfare. The most common practise of siege warfare was, however, to lay siege and wait for the surrender of the enemies inside. Due to the problem of logistics, long lasting sieges involving anything but a minor force could seldom be maintained.\n\nAncient siege warfare varied from each civilization and how each city was defended differently and had to approached with different tactics. One way to ensure an army used all its troops in its siege is shown when its explained how a chariot can be used in a siege, saying that, \u201cDuring the sieges, the chariots, and mostly in the Neo-Assyrian armies, were surely employed to patrol and protect the flanks and the rear of the besiegers\u2019 lines and camp.\u201d (UF 41 p. 5).<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThis shows that generals had to find new tactics to incorporate parts of their army that wouldn\u2019t work in the siege, as shown with the chariots on patrol duty and ensuring the army was safe from a flank attack from the enemy army. This strategy ensures that all forces are used and contributing to the battle effort and helping gain victory for them and all pulling their weight as well.\n\n== By culture ==\n\n=== Ancient Near East ===\n\n==== Mesopotamia ====\n{{main|Military history of the Assyrian Empire|Military history of Iraq}}\n\n==== Egypt ====\n{{main|Military history of Egypt|Military of ancient Egypt}}\nThroughout most of its history, [[ancient Egypt]] was unified under one government. The main military concern for the nation was to keep enemies out. The arid plains and deserts surrounding Egypt were inhabited by nomadic tribes who occasionally tried to raid or settle in the fertile [[Nile]] river valley. The [[Egyptians]] built fortresses and outposts along the borders east and west of the Nile Delta, in the Eastern Desert, and in [[Nubia]] to the south. Small garrisons could prevent minor incursions, but if a large force was detected a message was sent for the main army corps. Most Egyptian cities lacked city walls and other defenses.\n\nThe first Egyptian soldiers carried a simple armament consisting of a spear with a copper spearhead and a large wooden shield covered by leather hides. A stone mace was also carried in the Archaic period, though later this weapon was probably only in ceremonial use, and was replaced with the bronze battle axe. The spearmen were supported by archers carrying a composite bow and arrows with arrowheads made of flint or copper. No armour was used during the 3rd and early 2nd Millennium BC. As the dynasties expanded and grew upon the last that fell to gain new territory and control new people for the empire of Egypt. One of the ways the dynasties were different were the new technologies used in the later dynasties against the enemy. One example is the armies of Ramesses\u2019 II faced off against the Hittites in the Battle of Qadesh. Both armies have cavalry units supporting their infantry and scouts to get updates on the movements. These advances differ from two groups attacking head on for control of an area and facing losses on both sides\n\nThe major advance in weapons technology and warfare began around 1600 BC when the Egyptians fought and defeated the [[Hyksos]] people, who ruled Lower Egypt at the time. It was during this period the horse and chariot were introduced into Egypt. Other new technologies included the [[sickle sword]], body [[armour]] and improved bronze casting. In the [[New Kingdom]], the Egyptian military changed from levy troops into a firm organization of professional soldiers. Conquests of foreign territories, like Nubia, required a permanent force to be garrisoned abroad. The Egyptians were mostly used to slowly defeating a much weaker enemy, town by town, until beaten into submission. The preferred tactic was to subdue a weaker city or kingdom one at a time resulting in surrender of each fraction until complete domination was achieved. The encounter with other powerful Near Eastern kingdoms like [[Mitanni]], the [[Hittites]], and later the [[Assyria]]ns and [[Babylonians]], made it necessary for the Egyptians to conduct campaigns far from home. The next leap forwards came in the Late Period (712\u2013332 BC), when mounted troops and weapons made of iron came into use. After the conquest by [[Alexander the Great]], Egypt was heavily Hellenized and the main military force became the infantry [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]]. The ancient Egyptians were not great innovators in weapons technology, and most weapons technology innovation came from Western Asia and the Greek world.\n\nThese soldiers were paid with a plot of land for the provision of their families. After fulfilment of their service, the veterans were allowed retirement to these estates. Generals could become quite influential at the court, but unlike other feudal states, the Egyptian military was completely controlled by the king. Foreign mercenaries were also recruited; first Nubians ([[Medjay]]), and later also Libyans and Sherdens in the New Kingdom. By the Persian period Greek mercenaries entered service into the armies of the rebellious pharaohs. The Jewish mercenaries at [[Elephantine]] served the Persian overlords of Egypt in the 5th century BC. Although,  they might also have served the Egyptian Pharaohs of the 6th century BC.\n\nAs far as had been seen from the royal propaganda of the time, the king or the crown prince personally headed the Egyptian troops into battle. The army could number tens of thousands of soldiers, so the smaller battalions consisting of 250 men, led by an officer, may have been the key of command. The tactics involved a massive strike by archery followed by an infantry and/or chariotry attacking the broken enemy lines. The enemies could,  however, try to surprise the large Egyptian force with ambushes and by blocking the road as the Egyptian campaign records informs us.\n\nWithin the [[Nile]] valley itself, ships and barges were important military elements. Ships were vital for providing supplies for the troops. The Nile river had no fords so barges had to be used for river crossings. Dominating the river often proved necessary for prosecuting sieges, like the Egyptian conquest of the [[Hyksos]] capital [[Avaris]]. Egypt had no navy to fight naval battles at sea before the Late Period. However, a battle involving ships took place at the Egyptian coast in the 12th century BC between [[Ramesses III]] and seafaring raiders.\n\n==== Persia ====\n{{main|Military history of Iran}}\nAncient Persia first emerged as a major military power under [[Cyrus the Great]]. Its form of warfare was based on massed infantry in light armor to pin the enemy force whilst cavalry dealt the killing blow. Cavalry was used in huge numbers but it is not known whether they were heavily armored or not. Most Greek sources claim the Persians wore no armor, but we do have an example from Herodotus which claims that an unhorsed cavalry Officer wore a gold cuirass under his red robes. Chariots were used in the early days but during the later days of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] they were surpassed by horsemen. During the Persian Empire's height, they even possessed [[war elephants]] from North Africa and distant India. The elite of the Persian Army were the famous [[Persian Immortals]], a 10,000 strong unit of professional soldiers armed with a spear, a sword and a bow. Archers also formed a major component of the Persian Army.\n\nPersian tactics primarily had four stages involving archers, infantry and cavalry. The archers, which wielded longbows, would fire waves of arrows before the battle, attempting to cut the enemy numbers down prior battle. The cavalry would then attempt to run into the enemy and sever communications between generals and soldiers. Infantry would then proceed to attack the disoriented soldiers, subsequently weakened from the previous attacks.\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main|Military history of India}}\nDuring the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic period]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1500\u2013500 BC), the ''[[Vedas]]'' and other associated texts contain references to warfare. The earliest allusions to a specific battle are those to the  [[Battle of the Ten Kings]] in [[Mandala 7]] of the [[Rigveda]].\n\nThe two great ancient epics of [[India]], ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (c. 1000\u2013500 BC) are centered on conflicts and refer to military formations, theories of warfare and esoteric weaponry. [[Valmiki]]'s ''Ramayana'' describes [[Ayodhya]]'s military as defensive rather than aggressive. The city, it says, was strongly fortified and was surrounded by a deep moat. ''Ramayana'' describes Ayodhya in the following words: \"The city abounded in warriors undefeated in battle, fearless and chinskilled in the use of arms, resembling lions guarding their mountain caves\". ''Mahabharata'' describes various military techniques, including the ''[[Chakravyuha]]''.\n\nThe world's first recorded military application of [[war elephant]]s is in the Mahabharatha.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Asian Elephant: Ecology and Management|author=R. Sukumar|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993}}</ref> From India, war elephants were brought to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] where they were used in several campaigns. The Persian king [[Darius III]] employed about 50 Indian elephants in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] (331 BC) fought against Alexander the Great. In the [[Battle of the Hydaspes River]], the Indian king [[King Porus|Porus]], who ruled in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], with his smaller army of 200 war elephants, 2000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry, presented great difficulty for Alexander the Great's larger army of 4000 cavalry and 50,000 infantry, though Porus was eventually defeated. At this time, the [[Nanda Empire]] further east in [[North India|northern]] and [[East India|eastern]] India had an army of 6000 war elephants, 80,000 cavalry, 200,000 infantry and 8000 armed chariots.\n\n[[Chanakya]] (c. 350\u2013275 BC) was a professor of [[political science]] at [[Takshashila University]], and later the [[Prime Minister]] of emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of the [[Maurya Empire]]. Chanakya wrote the ''[[Arthashastra]]'', which covered various topics on ancient Indian warfare in great detail, including various techniques and strategies relating to war. These included the earliest uses of [[espionage]] and [[assassination]]s. These techniques and strategies were employed by Chandragupta Maurya, who was a student of Chanakya, and later by [[Ashoka]] (304\u2013232 BC).\n\nChandragupta Maurya conquered the Magadha Empire and expanded to all of northern India, establishing the Maurya Empire, which extended from the [[Arabian Sea]] to the [[Bay of Bengal]]. In 305 BC, Chandragupta defeated [[Seleucus I Nicator]], who ruled the [[Seleucid Empire]] and controlled most of the territories conquered by Alexander the Great. Seleucus eventually lost his territories in Southern Asia, including southern [[Afghanistan]], to Chandragupta. Seleucus exchanged territory west of the Indus for 500 war elephants and offered his daughter to Chandragupta. In this matrimonial alliance the enmity turned into friendship, and Seleucus' dispatched an ambassador, [[Megasthenes]], to the Mauryan court at [[Pataliputra]]. As a result of this treaty, the Maurya Empire was recognized as a great power by the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic World]], and the kings of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] sent their own ambassadors to his court. According to Megasthenes, Chandragupta Maurya built an army consisting of 30,000 cavalry, 9000 war elephants, and 600,000 infantry, which was the largest army known in the ancient world. Ashoka went on to expand the Maurya Empire to almost all of [[South Asia]], along with much of Afghanistan and parts of [[Iran|Persia]]. Ashoka eventually gave up on warfare after converting to [[Buddhism]].\n\n=== China ===\n{{main|Military history of China (pre-1911)}}\nAncient China during the [[Shang Dynasty]] was a Bronze Age society based on [[chariot]] armies. Archaeological study of Shang sites at [[Anyang]] have revealed extensive examples of chariots and bronze weapons. The overthrow of the Shang by the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] saw the creation of a feudal social order, resting militarily on a class of aristocratic chariot warriors (\u58eb).\n\nIn the [[Spring and Autumn period]], warfare increased exponentially. ''Zuo zhuan'' describes the wars and battles among the feudal lords during the period. Warfare continued to be stylised and ceremonial even as it grew more violent and decisive. The concept of military hegemon (\u9738) and his \"way of force\" (\u9738\u9053) came to dominate Chinese society. [[Sun Tzu]] created a book that still applies to today's modern armies, [[The Art of War]].\n\nFormations of the army can be clearly seen from the Terracotta Army of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first Emperor in the history of China to be successful in unification of different warring states. Light infantry acting as shock troops lead the army, followed by heavy infantry as the main body of the army. Wide usage of cavalry and chariots behind the heavy infantry also gave the Qin army an edge in battles against the other warring states.\n\nWarfare became more intense, ruthless and much more decisive during the [[Warring States period]], in which great social and political change was accompanied by the end of the system of chariot warfare and the adoption of mass infantry armies. Cavalry was also introduced from the northern frontier, despite the cultural challenge it posed for robe-wearing Chinese men. Chinese river valley civilizations would adopt nomadic \"[[pants]]\" for their cavalry units and soldiers.\n\n=== Ancient Greece ===\n{{main|Military history of Greece|Ancient Greek warfare}}\n\nIn general, most features of the [[Hoplite#Equipment|hoplite panoply]] of classical Greek antiquity, were already known during the Late Bronze Age by [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] (c. 1600\u20131100 BC).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kagan|first1=Donald|last2=Viggiano|first2=Gregory F.|title=Men of Bronze: Hoplite Warfare in Ancient Greece|year=2013|location=Princeton, NJ|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-4630-6|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=xx6orLkVV4YC|ref=harv|page=36|quote=In fact, most of the essential items of the \"hoplite panoply\" were known to Mycenaean Greece, including the metallic helmet and the single thrusting spear}}</ref> Mycenaean Greek society invested in the development of [[Military of Mycenaean Greece|military infrastructure]], while military production and logistics were supervised directly from the palatial centers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Palaima |first1=Tom |title=Mycenaean Militarism from a Textual Perspective |journal=Polemos: Warfare in the Aegean Bronze Age (Aegaeum) |date=1999 |volume=19 |pages=367\u201378 |url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/pasp/oldsite/publications/pdf/militarism.pdf |accessdate=14 October 2015 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nInfantry did almost all of the fighting in Greek battles. The Greeks did not have any notable cavalry tradition except the Thessalians.<ref>Cavalry Operations in the Ancient Greek World by Robert E. Gaebel,{{ISBN|0-8061-3444-5}}, 2004, p. 59, \"... It is perhaps unlikely that by 500 cavalry played an important military role anywhere south of Thessaly, where cavalry traditionally dominated, but there can be little doubt that there were aristocratic cavalrymen on the battlefields in some ...\"</ref> [[Hoplites]], Greek infantry, fought with a long spear and a large shield, the [[hoplon]] also called [[aspis]]. Light infantry (psiloi) [[peltasts]], served as skirmishers.\n\nDespite the fact that most Greek cities were well fortified (with the notable exception of [[Sparta]]) and Greek siege technology was not up to the task of breaching these fortifications by force, most land battles were pitched ones fought on flat-open ground. This was because of the limited period of service Greek soldiers could offer before they needed to return to their farms; hence, a decisive battle was needed to settle matters at hand. To draw out a city's defenders, its fields would be threatened with destruction, threatening the defenders with starvation in the winter if they did not surrender or accept battle.\n\nThis pattern of warfare was broken during the [[Peloponnesian War]], when [[Athens]]' command of the sea allowed the city to ignore the destruction of the Athenian crops by [[Sparta]] and her allies by shipping grain into the city from the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]. This led to a warfare style in which both sides were forced to engage in repeated raids over several years without reaching a settlement. It also made sea battle a vital part of warfare. Greek naval battles were fought between [[triremes]] \u2013 long  and speedy rowing ships which engaged the enemy by ramming and boarding actions.\n\n==== Hellenistic Era ====\n{{Main|Ancient Macedonian army|Hellenistic armies}}\nDuring the time of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] were regarded as the most complete well co-ordinated [[military]] force in the known world. Although they are best known for the achievements of [[Alexander the Great]], his father [[Philip II of Macedon]] created and designed the fighting force Alexander used in his conquests. Before this time and for centuries their military prowess was nowhere near that the [[sarissa]] [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] offered.\n\nHowever prior to the improvements made by [[Philip II of Macedon]] armies fought in the traditional manner of the Greeks; that of the [[hoplite]] [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]].\n\nPhilip provided his [[Macedon]]ian soldiers in the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] with [[sarissa]], a [[spear]] which was 4\u20136 meters in length. The sarissa, when held upright by the rear [[Rank (formation)|rank]]s of the phalanx (there were usually eight ranks), helped hide maneuvers behind the phalanx from the view of the enemy. When held horizontal by the front ranks of the phalanx, enemies could be run through from far away. The [[hoplite]] type troops were not abandoned,<ref name=\":4\" >Macedonian Warrior Alexander's elite infantryman, p. 41,{{ISBN|978-1-84176-950-9}},2006</ref> but were no longer the core of the army.\n\nIn 358 BC he met the [[Illyrians]] in battle with his reorganized Macedonian phalanx, and utterly defeated them. The Illyrians fled in panic, leaving the majority of their 9,000-strong army dead. The [[Ancient Macedonian military|Macedonian army]] invaded [[Illyria]] and conquered the southern Illyrian tribes.\n\nAfter the defeat of the [[Illyrians]], [[Macedon]]'s policy became increasingly aggressive. [[Paionia|Paeonia]] was already forcefully integrated into [[Macedon]] under [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]]'s rule. In 357 BC Philip broke the treaty with [[Athens]] and attacked [[Amphipolis]] which promised to surrender to the [[Athenians]] in exchange for the fortified town of [[Pydna]], a promise he didn't keep. The city fell back in the hands of [[Macedon]]ia after an intense [[siege]]. Then he secured possession over the [[Gold mining|gold mines]] of nearby [[Mount Pangaeus]], which would enable him to finance his future wars.\n\nIn 356 the Macedonian army advanced further eastward and captured the town of [[Crenides (Macedonia)|Crenides]] (near modern [[Drama, Greece|Drama]]) which was in the hands of the [[Thracians]], and which Philip renamed after himself to [[Philippi]]. The Macedonian eastern border with [[Thrace]] was now secured at the river [[Nestus]] (Mesta).\n\n[[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]] next marched against his southern enemies. In [[Thessaly]] he defeated his enemies and by 352, he was firmly in control of this region. The Macedonian [[army]] advanced as far as the pass of [[Thermopylae]] which divides [[Greece]] in two parts, but it did not attempt to take it because it was strongly guarded by a joint force of [[Athenians]], [[Sparta]]ns, and [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaeans]].\n\nHaving secured the bordering regions of [[Macedon]], [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]] assembled a large Macedonian army and marched deep into Thrace for a long conquering campaign. By 339 after defeating the Thracians in series of battles, most of [[Thrace]] was firmly in Macedonian hands save the most eastern [[Greece|Greek]] coastal cities of [[Byzantium]] and [[Perinthus]] who successfully withstood the long and difficult sieges. But both [[Byzantium]] and [[Perinthus]] would have surely fallen had it not been for the help they received from the various Greek city-states, and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] king himself, who now viewed the rise of [[Macedon]]ia and its eastern expansion with concern. Ironically, the Greeks invited and sided with the [[Persian people|Persians]] against the Macedonians, although Persia had been the nation hated the most by [[Greece]] for more than a century. The memory of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] invasion of [[Greece]] some 150 years ago was still alive, but the current politics for the Macedonians had put it aside.\n\nMuch greater would be the conquests of his son, [[Alexander the Great]], who would add to the phalanx a powerful [[cavalry]],  led by his elite [[Companion Cavalry|Companions]], and flexible, innovative formations and tactics.  He advanced [[Greece|Greek]] style of combat, and was able to muster large bodies of men for long periods of time for his campaigns against [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]].\n\n=== Iron Age Europe ===\n\n==== Roman Empire ====\n{{main|Military History of Rome|Roman infantry tactics, strategy and battle formations}}\nThe [[Roman army]] was the world's first professional army. It had its origins in the citizen army of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for Rome. The reforms of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] around 100 BC turned the army into a professional structure, still largely filled by citizens, but citizens who served continuously for 20 years before being discharged.\n\nThe Romans were also noted for making use of auxiliary troops, non-Romans who served with the legions and filled roles that the traditional Roman military could not fill effectively, such as light skirmish troops and heavy cavalry. Later in the Empire, these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman military. By the late Empire, tribes such as the [[Visigoths]] were bribed to serve as mercenaries.\n\nThe Roman navy was traditionally considered less important, although it remained vital for the transportation of supplies and troops, also during the great purge of pirates from the Mediterranean sea by Pompey the Great in the 1st century BC. Most of Rome's battles occurred on land, especially when the Empire was at its height and all the land around the [[Mediterranean]] was controlled by Rome.\n\nBut there were notable exceptions. The [[First Punic War]], a pivotal war between Rome and Carthage in the 3rd century BC, was largely a naval conflict. And the naval [[Battle of Actium]] established the Roman empire under [[Augustus]].\n\n==== Balkans ====\n{{Main|Illyrian warfare}}\n\nThe Illyrian king [[Bardyllis]] turned part of south [[Illyria]] into a formidable local power in the 4th century BC. He managed to become king of the [[Dardanians (Balkans)|Dardanians]]<ref>Borza, Eugene N. In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon, 1990, p. 180, {{ISBN|0-691-00880-9}}.

However their power was weakened by bitter rivalries and jealousy. The army was composed by [[peltast]]s with a variety of weapons.\n {{Main|Thracian warfare}}\nThe [[Thracians]] fought as [[peltast]]s using [[javelins]] and crescent or round wicker shields.Missile weapons were favored but close combat weaponry was carried by the Thracians as well. These close combat weapons varied from the dreaded [[Rhomphaia]] & [[Falx]]\nto [[spear]]s and swords. Thracians shunned armor and greaves and fought as light as possible favoring mobility above all other traits and had excellent horsemen.<ref>The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC (Hardcover)\nby John Boardman (Editor), I.

They established a highly [[militarized]] society and, during the periods when the tribes were united under one [[Monarch|king]] (82\u201344 BC, 86\u2013106) posed a major threat to the [[Roman province]]s of Lower [[Danube]]. Dacia was conquered and transformed into a Roman province in 106 after a long, hard [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|war]].\n\n==== Celtic ====\n{{main|Celtic warfare}}\n{{further|Gallic Wars|Gaelic warfare}}\n\n[[Endemic warfare|Tribal warfare]] appears to have been a regular feature of [[Celts|Celtic societies]]. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some instances to conquer territory.\n\nThe Celts were described by classical writers such as  [[Strabo]], [[Livy]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], and [[Florus]] as fighting like \"wild beasts\", and as hordes. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] said that their \"manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in [[military science]]. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of [[Boar|wild boars]], throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all\".<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus,  ''Roman Antiquities''\np. 259 Excerpts from Book XIV</ref> Such descriptions have been challenged by contemporary historians.<ref>{{cite book\n|author=Ellis, Peter Berresford\n|title= ''The Celts: A History''\n|pages= 60\u201363\n|publisher=Caroll & Graf\n|year= 1998\n|isbn= 0-7867-1211-2}}</ref> Caesar himself describes the Gauls as forming phalanxes (likely similar to the medieval shieldwall) and testudos in battle, and using spears as their main weapon, as opposed to swords.\n\n==== Germanic ====\n[[File:Praying Germanic man 1890.jpg|right|thumb|Roman bronze figurine depicting a Germanic man adorned with a [[Suebian knot]] engaged in prayer. (Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris)]]\n{{further|Germanic Wars|Gothic warfare|Anglo-Saxon warfare|Migration period spear}}\nHistorical records of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] in [[Germania]] east of the [[Rhine]] and west of the [[Danube]] do not begin until quite late in the ancient period, so only the period after 100 BC can be examined. What is clear is that the Germanic idea of warfare was quite different from the pitched battles fought by [[Rome]] and [[Greece]]. Instead the Germanic tribes focused on raids.\n\nThe purpose of these was generally not to gain territory, but rather to capture resources and secure prestige. These raids were conducted by [[irregular military|irregular troops]], often formed along family or village lines. Leaders of unusual personal magnetism could gather more soldiers for longer periods, but there was no systematic method of gathering and training men, so the death of a charismatic leader could mean the destruction of an army. Armies also often consisted of more than 50 percent noncombatants, as displaced people would travel with large groups of soldiers, the elderly, women, and children.\n\nThough often defeated by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], the Germanic tribes were remembered in Roman records as fierce combatants, whose main downfall was that they failed to unite successfully into one fighting force, under one [[Command (military formation)|command]].<ref name=\"Tacitus\">Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#45|2.45]]</ref>  After the three [[Roman legion]]s were ambushed and destroyed by an alliance of Germanic tribes headed by [[Arminius]] at the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in 9 AD, the Roman Empire made no further concentrated attempts at conquering Germania beyond the Rhine. Prolonged warfare against the Romans accustomed the Germanic tribes to improved tactics such as the use of reserves, military discipline and centralised command.<ref <ref name=\"Tacitus\"/> Germanic tribes would eventually overwhelm and conquer the ancient world, giving rise to modern Europe and medieval warfare. For an analysis of Germanic tactics versus the Roman empire see [[Roman infantry tactics#Roman infantry versus Gallic and the Germanic tribes|tactical problems in facing the Gauls and the Germanic tribes]]\n\n=== Japanese ===\n{{main|Military history of Japan}}\nHorses and bows were very important in Japan, and were used in warfare from very early times, as shown in statues and artifacts found in tombs of early chieftains. Samurai eventually became very skilled in using the horse. Because their main weapon at this time was the bow and arrow, early samurai exploits were spoken of in Japanese war tales as the \u201cWay of the Horse and Bow.\u201d Horse and bow combined was a battlefield advantage to the early samurai. A bunch of arrows made of mainly wood with poison tipped points were worn on a warrior's right side so he could quickly knock and release an arrow mid-gallop.\n\nAlthough they weren't as important as the bow, swords of various sizes and types were also part of an early samurai's armory. They were mostly for close quarters engagements. Many different kinds of spears were also used. One, the [[naginata]], was a curved blade fixed to the end of a pole several feet long. This was known as a 'woman's spear' because samurai girls were taught to use it from an early age. A device called the kumade, which resembled a long-handled garden rake, was used to catch the clothing or helmet of enemy horsemen and unseat them.\n\nCommon samurai archers had armor made of lamellae pieces laced together with colorful cords. The lightweight armor allowed for greater freedom of movement, faster speed, and reduced fatigue for horse and rider.\n\nThe early [[Yamato period]] had seen a continual engagement in the Korean Peninsula until Japan finally withdrew, along with the remaining forces of the [[Baekje]] Kingdom. Several battles occurred in these periods as the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor's]] succession gained importance. By the [[Nara period]], [[Honsh\u016b]] was completely under the control of the [[Yamato (people)|Yamato]] clan. Near the end of the [[Heian period]], [[samurai]] became a powerful political force, thus starting the feudal period.\n\n== Notable ancient wars ==\n* [[Medo-Babylonian war against Assyrian Empire]]\n* [[Ionian Revolt]]\n:The '''Ionian Revolt''' was a series of conflicts between the [[Ionia]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] that began 499 BC and lasted until 493 BC. The revolt begins because of Athens's offensive attack to the city of Sardis and massacring the Persian citizens by burning down the city. This revolt had a major role in starting the Greco-Persian wars.\n* [[Greco-Persian Wars]]\n:The '''Greco-Persian Wars''' were a series of conflicts between the [[Ancient Greece|Greek City-States]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] that began around 500 BC and lasted until 448 BC.\n* [[Peloponnesian War]]\n:The '''Peloponnesian War''' was begun in 431 BC between the [[Athenian Empire]] and the [[Peloponnesian League]] which included [[Sparta]] and [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]]. The war was documented by [[Thucydides]], an Athenian general, in his work ''[[The History of The Peloponnesian War]]''. The war lasted 27 years, with a brief truce in the middle.\n* [[Wars of Alexander the Great]].\n:King Alexander the III of Macedonia throughout his entire reign from 336 to 321 B.C embarked on a '''campaign of conquest of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]'''. Starting from modern day Western Turkey Alexander the Great conquered the entirety of Egypt, the Middle East, Iran and parts of India and Central Asia. Never losing a battle Alexander expanded the boundaries of the known world to the [[Hellenistic period|Greek World]] at the time. With an untimely death his successors fought over the territories they had conquered. However, due to Alexander the Great Greek culture and technology spread into Asia for centuries to come. \n* [[Kalinga War]] (265\u2013264 BC) was a war fought between the [[Mauryan Empire]] under [[Ashoka]] and the state of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]], a feudal [[republic]] located on the coast of the present-day [[India]]n state of [[Odisha]]. Ashoka's response to the Kalinga War is recorded in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]]. According to some of these (Rock Edict XIII and Minor Rock Edict I), the Kalinga War prompted Ashoka, already a non-engaged Buddhist, to devote the rest of his life to [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence) and to Dhamma-Vijaya (victory through [[Dhamma]]).\n*[[Qin's wars of unification]]\n:'''Qin's wars of unification were''' a series of military campaigns launched in the late 3rd century BC by the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] against the other [[Seven Warring States|six major states]] \u2013 [[Han (state)|Han]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]] and [[Qi (state)|Qi]] \u2013 within the territories that formed modern [[China]]. By the end of the wars in 221 BC, Qin had unified most of the states and occupied some lands south of the [[Yangtze River]]. The territories conquered by Qin served as the foundation of the [[Qin dynasty|Qin Empire]].\n* [[Punic Wars]]\n:'''The Punic Wars''' were a series of three wars fought between [[Rome]] and the city of [[Carthage]] (a [[Phoenicia]]n descendant). They are known as the \"Punic\" Wars because Rome's name for Carthaginians was ''Punici'' (older ''Poeni'', due to their Phoenician ancestry). They determined that the Romans would control the Mediterranean Sea and led to the eventual rise of the greater [[Roman Empire]] across Europe, Asia and Africa.\n# The [[First Punic War]] was primarily a naval war fought between 264 BC and 241 BC.\n# The [[Second Punic War]] is famous for [[Hannibal]]'s crossing of the [[Alps]] and was fought between 218 BC and 202 BC.\n# The [[Third Punic War]] resulted in the destruction of Carthage and was fought between 149 BC and 146 BC.\n\n* [[Roman-Persian Wars]]\n:The '''Roman&ndash;Persian Wars''' were a series of conflicts between states of the [[Greco-Roman world]] and two successive [[Greater Iran|Iranian empires]]: the Parthian and the Sassanid. Battles between the [[Parthian Empire]] and the [[Roman Republic]] began in 92&nbsp;BC;  wars began under the late Republic, and continued through the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid empire]]s. They were ended by the [[Muslim conquests|Arab Muslim invasions]], which devastated the Sassanid and [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine East Roman]] empires shortly after the end of the last war between them.\n\n*[[Han\u2013Xiongnu War]]\n:The '''Han\u2013Xiongnu War''',<ref name=wu5-71>{{Harvnb|Wu|2013|loc=71}}.</ref> also known as the '''Sino-Xiongnu War''',<ref name=\"ZaidanSent\u01012007\">{{cite book|author1=Nara Shiruku R\u014ddo-haku Kinen Kokusai K\u014dry\u016b Zaidan|author2=Shiruku R\u014ddo-gaku Kenky\u016b Sent\u0101|title=Opening up the Silk Road: the Han and the Eurasian world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YfVwAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2 February 2013|year=2007|publisher=Nara International Foundation Commemorating the Silk Road Exposition|isbn=978-4-916071-61-3|page=23}}</ref> was a series of military battles fought between the Chinese [[Han Dynasty|Han empire]] and the [[Xiongnu]] confederated state located in modern day Mongolia from 133 BC to 89 AD. The final wars resulted in the final destruction of the [[Xiongnu]] as a political entity in Siberia. China would temporally enjoy peace on its northern frontier before new peoples such as the [[Xianbei]] took the role of the [[Xiongnu]].\n\n* [[Germanic Wars|Roman-Germanic Wars]]\n:The''' Germanic Wars''' is a name given to a large series of military engagements between the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and various [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] between 113 BC and AD 596. The nature of these wars varied through time between Roman conquest, Germanic uprisings and later Germanic invasions in the Roman Empire that started in the late 2nd century. The series of conflicts which began in the 5th century, under the Western Roman [[Honorius (emperor)|Emperor Honorius]], led (along with internal strife) to the ultimate downfall of the [[Western Roman Empire]].\n\n== Notable ancient battles ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Battle of Megiddo (15th century BC)|Battle of Megiddo]], c. 1457 BC\n* [[Battle of the Ten Kings]], c. 1400 BC\n* [[Battle of Kadesh]], 1274 BC\n* [[Battle of Muye]], 1046 BC\n* Battle of Kurukshetra 950 BCE\n* [[Battle of Qarqar]], 853 BC\n* [[Battle of Nineveh (612 BC)|Battle of Nineveh]], 612 BC\n* [[Battle of Megiddo (609 BC)|Battle of Megiddo]], 609 BC\n* [[Battle of Carchemish]], 605 BC\n* [[Battle of Pteria]], 547 BC\n* [[Battle of Thymbra]], 546 BC\n* [[Battle of Lade]], 494 BC\n* [[Battle of Marathon]], 490 BC\n* [[Battle of Thermopylae]], 480 BC\n* [[Battle of Artemisium]], 480 BC\n* [[Battle of Salamis]], 480 BC\n* [[Battle of Plataea]], 479 BC\n* [[Battle of Mycale]], 479 BC\n* [[Battle of Cunaxa]], 401 BC\n* [[Battle of the Allia]], 387 BC\n* [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]], 338 BC\n* [[Battle of Issus]], 333 BC\n* [[Battle of Gaugamela]], 331 BC\n* [[Battle of the Persian Gate]], 330 BC\n* [[Battle of the Hydaspes River]], 326 BC\n* [[Battle of Paraitacene]], 317 BC\n* [[Battle of Gabiene]], 316 BC\n* [[Battle of Ipsus]], 301 BC\n* [[Battle of Corupedium]], 281 BC\n* [[Siege of Saguntum]], 218 BC\n* [[Battle of Ticinus]], 218 BC\n* [[Battle of the Trebia]], 218 BC\n* [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]], 217 BC\n* [[Battle of Ager Falernus]], 217 BC\n* [[Battle of Raphia]], 217 BC\n* [[Battle of Geronium]], 217 BC\n* [[Battle of Cannae]], 216 BC\n* [[Battle of the Metaurus]], 207 BC\n* [[Battle of Jingxing|Battle of Tao River]], 204 BC\n* [[Battle of Wei River]], 204 BC\n* [[Battle of Gaixia]], 202 BC\n* [[Battle of Zama]], 202 BC\n* [[Battle of Pydna]], 168 BC\n* [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]], 197 BC\n* [[Battle of Magnesia]], 190 BC\n* [[Battle of Ecbatana]], 129 BC\n* [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae]], 102 BC\n* [[Battle of Vercellae]], 101 BC\n* [[Battle of Tigranocerta]], 69 BC\n* [[Battle of Vosges (58 BC)|Battle of Vosges]], 58 BC\n* [[Battle of Carrhae]], 53 BC\n* [[Battle of Gergovia]], 52 BC\n* [[Battle of Alesia]], 52 BC\n* [[Battle of Pharsalus]], 48 BC\n* [[Battle of Munda]], 45 BC\n* [[Battle of Actium]], 31 BC\n* [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], 9 AD\n* [[Battle of Watling Street]], 60 \n* [[Battle of Ikh Bayan]], 89\n* [[Battle of Red Cliffs]], 208\n* [[Battle of Edessa]], 259\n* [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]],   312\n* [[Battle of Adrianople]], 378\n* [[Battle of Fei River]], 383\n* [[Battle of Chalons]], 451\n* [[Sack of Rome (455)|Sack of Rome]], 455}}\n\n== Unit types ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Infantry]]\n** [[Archery]]\n** [[Slingman]]\n** [[Peltast]]\n** [[Hoplite]]\n** [[Persian Immortals|Persian Immortal]]\n** [[Phalanx formation|Phalanx]]\n*** [[Macedonian phalanx]]\n** [[Roman legion|Legion]]\n*** [[Legionary]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Cavalry]]\n** [[Cataphract]]\n** [[Clibanarii]]\n** [[Horse archer]]\n** [[Chariot]]\n** [[War elephant]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Artillery]] and [[siege engines]]\n** [[Catapult]]\n** [[Onager (siege weapon)|Onager]]\n** [[Ballista]]\n** [[Scorpio (Dart-thrower)|Scorpio]]\n** [[Siege tower]]\n** [[Battering ram]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ancient Mediterranean piracy]]\n* [[Horses in warfare]]\n* [[Women in warfare]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Literature ==\n# Anglim, Simon, and Phyllis G.

He was known especially for his popular poetry written during the [[Second World War]], but he also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction. Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006]</ref> At this time he was one of a group of young writers (including [[Dylan Thomas]], [[George Barker (poet)|George Barker]] and [[David Gascoyne]]) who gathered about the well-known bookshop at No 4, Parton Street, near London's [[Red Lion Square]], run by David Archer.<ref>[https://www.penpushermagazine.co.uk/magazine/issues/article/215/ Goodall, Anna. 'Parton Street Bookshop' in ''Pen Pusher'']</ref> His first published collection of verse, ''Spring Encounter'', came out in 1933 from [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] and gained the attention of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] who became a patron. Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]], and worked as a producer at the [[BBC]], where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

''London Writing of the 1930s'' (2018) p 88]</ref>\n\n==War Poetry==\nIt was the advent of the Second World War that enabled Pudney to find his subject - the effect that war has on the lives of ordinary people - and with it, his audience.<ref name=times>''The Times'' obituary, 11 November 1977, p 17</ref> In 1940 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] as an intelligence officer and as a member of the [[Air Ministry]]'s Creative Writers Unit - a non-combatant role. It was while he was serving as squadron intelligence officer at [[RAF St Eval]] in Cornwall that Pudney wrote one of the best-known poems of the war.<ref name=dnb/> ''For Johnny'' evoked popular fellow-feeling in the London of 1941.<ref>[http://www.carolinemdavies.co.uk/2012/06/07/collected-poems-john-pudney/ Davies, Caroline. ''Collected Poems, John Pudney'']</ref> Written during an air raid, it was published first in the News Chronicle, and featured significantly in the film ''[[The Way to the Stars]]'':\n\n<poem>\nDo not despair\nFor Johnny-head-in-air;\nHe sleeps as sound\nAs Johnny underground.\n\nFetch out no shroud\nFor Johnny-in-the-cloud;\nAnd keep your tears\nFor him in after years.\n\nBetter by far\nFor Johnny-the-bright-star,\nTo keep your head,\nAnd see his children fed.\n</poem>\n\nPudney published several collections of poetry during the war, including ''Dispersal Point'' (1942) and ''South of Forty'' (1943, describing the author's experiences in North Africa). These collections sold over a quarter of a million copies between them.<ref name=white>White, Michael. 'Johnny Head-in-Air', in ''The Guardian'', 6 April, 1972, p 10</ref> One contemporary reviewer, noting that these poems were \"immediately topical and intended to reach a less poetically sophisticated audience\", showed \"how completely he has succeeded in combining the journalist and the poet. That is no easy matter, for the one usually swamps the other\".<ref>''The Listener'', 23 September 1943, p 357</ref>\n\n==Later Career==\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK General Election of July 1945]], Pudney stood as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]], polling 14,947 votes, or 36 per cent.<ref>''The International Who's Who'' (Europa Publications Limited, 1963) p. 857</ref><ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i17.htm UK General Election results July 1945] at keele.ac.uk, accessed 10 January 2009</ref> (The sitting Conservative MP [[Charles Ponsonby]] was re-elected with 46 per cent of the vote).\n\nAfter the war he continued to write and worked as a journalist and editor. He was the book critic for [[The Daily Express]] from 1945 and with the [[News Review]] from 1948 to 1950. He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to [[Evans Brothers]], Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). At Evans, Pudney bolstered the company's long-standing children's catalogue with his own boys adventures, the 11 volume 'Fred and I' series (''Monday Adventure'', ''Spring Adventure'' etc). One of them, ''Thursday Adventure'' (1955) was filmed as ''[[The Stolen Airliner]]'' (1955).<ref>[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/pudney_john 'John Pudney' in ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'']</ref> They featured classic front cover and internal illustrations by artists such as Ley Kenyon (1913-1990) and Douglas Relf.<ref>[https://www.aces-high.com/artists/view/ley-kenyon Aces High: Aviation Gallery]</ref> The later six volumes of Hartwarp adventures for younger children were published by Hamish Hamilton. Both series were popular and sold well in the 1950s and 1960s, but they haven't remained in print. \n\nMost significantly while at Evans, Pudney commissioned the Australian fighter pilot and prisoner of war [[Paul Brickhill]] to come to England and write [[The Great Escape (book)|''The Great Escape'']], which Evans published in 1950 attracting much attention. He had previously suggested to the Air Historical Branch of the British Air Ministry that Brickhill should be considered as the author of a history of [[617 Squadron]]. After the success of ''The Great Escape'' this was also published by Evans as [[The Dam Busters (book)|''The Dam Busters'']] (1951). It sold over one million copies in its first 50 years.<ref>Dando-Collins, Stephen. ''The Hero Maker: A Biography of Paul Brickhill'' (2016)</ref>\n\nOf his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> [[The Net (1953 film)|''The Net'']] was filmed by director [[Anthony Asquith]] in 1953.<ref>Pendo, Stephen. ''Aviation in the Cinema''. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 1985. {{ISBN|0-8-1081-746-2}}.</ref> In 1953 Pudney wrote the script for the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. Commissioned non-fiction (particularly aeronautical) became an important source of income for Pudney in his later years. Among these works were a history of the British state airline [[B.O.A.C.|B.O.A.C]] (''The Seven Skies'', 1959), and of [[Courage Brewery]] (''A Draught of Contentment'' (1971).<ref>[http://takecourage.info/index.html Text based on ''A Draught of Contentment'' at Courage & Co]</ref> \n\nHowever, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward, took on a more ironic stance but was still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/> His final two poems appeared in the ''Times Literary Supplement'' a few days after his death.<ref name=dnb/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] feminist Crystal Selwyn Herbert (1915-1999), daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They first lived in Cornwall in a converted lifeboat, then took a farm in Essex.<ref>Crystal Hale obituary in ''The Guardian'', 8 December 1999, p 24</ref>\nThere were two daughters and a son. They divorced in 1955, and Pudney immediately married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder.<ref name=white/> The recovery process became a subject for his writing. According to [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]] ''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died nearly two years later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978.\n\nJohn Pudney's daughter Tessa (1942-2004) was an academic best known for her work in media studies at [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. She married the film critic [[V. F. Perkins|Victor Perkins]] in the 1960s.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/nov/04/guardianobituaries.obituaries Tessa Perkins obituary in ''The Guardian'', 4 November 2004]</ref> Their son, [[Toby Perkins]], is the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Chesterfield]].\n\n==Works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''Spring Encounter'' (1933)\n*''Open the Sky'' ([[Boriswood]] 1934)\n*''Dispersal Point and other Air Poems'' (1942)\n*''The Grass Grew All Round'' (1942)\n*''Beyond This Disregard'' (1943) poems\n*''South of Forty'' (1943) poems\n*''Ten Summers'': Poems 1933-1943 (1944)\n*''Almanack of Hope'': Sonnets (1944)\n*''Air Force Poetry'' (1944) (anthology, edited with [[Henry Treece]])\n*''Flight above Cloud'' (1944)\n*''World Still There'' (1945)\n*Selected Poems (1946)\n*''Low Life'' (1947)\n*''Commemorations'' (1948)\n*''Sixpenny Songs'' (1953)\n*Collected Poems (1957)\n*''The Trampoline'' (1959)\n*''Spill Out'': Poems and Ballads (1967)\n*''Spandrels'': Poems and Ballads (1969)\n*''Take This Orange'': Poems and Ballads (1971)\n*Selected Poems 1967-1973 (1973)\n*''Living in a One-Sided House'' (1976) poems\n*''Writers' Workshop'', poetry anthology publication, editor with [[Norman Hidden]] and [[Michael Johnson (editor)|Michael Johnson]] (from 1967)<ref>Durham University.

However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse.<ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener]], and worked as a producer at the [[BBC]], where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

''London Writing of the 1930s'' (2018) p 88]</ref>\n\n==War Poetry==\nIt was the advent of the Second World War that enabled Pudney to find his subject - the effect that war has on the lives of ordinary people - and with it, his audience.<ref name=times>''The Times'' obituary, 11 November 1977, p 17</ref> In 1940 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] as an intelligence officer and as a member of the [[Air Ministry]]'s Creative Writers Unit - a non-combatant role. It was while he was serving as squadron intelligence officer at [[RAF St Eval]] in Cornwall that Pudney wrote one of the best-known poems of the war.<ref name=dnb/> ''For Johnny'' evoked popular fellow-feeling in the London of 1941.<ref>[http://www.carolinemdavies.co.uk/2012/06/07/collected-poems-john-pudney/ Davies, Caroline. ''Collected Poems, John Pudney'']</ref> Written during an air raid, it was published first in the News Chronicle, and featured significantly in the film ''[[The Way to the Stars]]'':\n\n<poem>\nDo not despair\nFor Johnny-head-in-air;\nHe sleeps as sound\nAs Johnny underground.\n\nFetch out no shroud\nFor Johnny-in-the-cloud;\nAnd keep your tears\nFor him in after years.\n\nBetter by far\nFor Johnny-the-bright-star,\nTo keep your head,\nAnd see his children fed.\n</poem>\n\nPudney published several collections of poetry during the war, including ''Dispersal Point'' (1942) and ''South of Forty'' (1943, describing the author's experiences in North Africa). These collections sold over a quarter of a million copies between them.<ref name=white>White, Michael. 'Johnny Head-in-Air', in ''The Guardian'', 6 April, 1972, p 10</ref> One contemporary reviewer, noting that these poems were \"immediately topical and intended to reach a less poetically sophisticated audience\", showed \"how completely he has succeeded in combining the journalist and the poet. That is no easy matter, for the one usually swamps the other\".<ref>''The Listener'', 23 September 1943, p 357</ref>\n\n==Later Career==\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK General Election of July 1945]], Pudney stood as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]], polling 14,947 votes, or 36 per cent.<ref>''The International Who's Who'' (Europa Publications Limited, 1963) p. 857</ref><ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i17.htm UK General Election results July 1945] at keele.ac.uk, accessed 10 January 2009</ref> (The sitting Conservative MP [[Charles Ponsonby]] was re-elected with 46 per cent of the vote).\n\nAfter the war he continued to write and worked as a journalist and editor. He was the book critic for [[The Daily Express]] from 1945 and with the [[News Review]] from 1948 to 1950. He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to [[Evans Brothers]], Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). At Evans, Pudney bolstered the company's long-standing children's catalogue with his own boys adventures, the 11 volume 'Fred and I' series (''Monday Adventure'', ''Spring Adventure'' etc). One of them, ''Thursday Adventure'' (1955) was filmed as ''[[The Stolen Airliner]]'' (1955).<ref>[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/pudney_john 'John Pudney' in ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'']</ref> They featured classic front cover and internal illustrations by artists such as Ley Kenyon (1913-1990) and Douglas Relf.<ref>[https://www.aces-high.com/artists/view/ley-kenyon Aces High: Aviation Gallery]</ref> The later six volumes of Hartwarp adventures for younger children were published by Hamish Hamilton. Both series were popular and sold well in the 1950s and 1960s, but they haven't remained in print. \n\nMost significantly while at Evans, Pudney commissioned the Australian fighter pilot and prisoner of war [[Paul Brickhill]] to come to England and write [[The Great Escape (book)|''The Great Escape'']], which Evans published in 1950 attracting much attention. He had previously suggested to the Air Historical Branch of the British Air Ministry that Brickhill should be considered as the author of a history of [[617 Squadron]]. After the success of ''The Great Escape'' this was also published by Evans as [[The Dam Busters (book)|''The Dam Busters'']] (1951). It sold over one million copies in its first 50 years.<ref>Dando-Collins, Stephen. ''The Hero Maker: A Biography of Paul Brickhill'' (2016)</ref>\n\nOf his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> [[The Net (1953 film)|''The Net'']] was filmed by director [[Anthony Asquith]] in 1953.<ref>Pendo, Stephen. ''Aviation in the Cinema''. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 1985. {{ISBN|0-8-1081-746-2}}.</ref> In 1953 Pudney wrote the script for the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. Commissioned non-fiction (particularly aeronautical) became an important source of income for Pudney in his later years. Among these works were a history of the British state airline [[B.O.A.C.|B.O.A.C]] (''The Seven Skies'', 1959), and of [[Courage Brewery]] (''A Draught of Contentment'' (1971).<ref>[http://takecourage.info/index.html Text based on ''A Draught of Contentment'' at Courage & Co]</ref> \n\nHowever, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward, took on a more ironic stance but was still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/> His final two poems appeared in the ''Times Literary Supplement'' a few days after his death.<ref name=dnb/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] feminist Crystal Selwyn Herbert (1915-1999), daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They first lived in Cornwall in a converted lifeboat, then took a farm in Essex.<ref>Crystal Hale obituary in ''The Guardian'', 8 December 1999, p 24</ref>\nThere were two daughters and a son. They divorced in 1955, and Pudney immediately married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder.<ref name=white/> The recovery process became a subject for his writing. According to [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]] ''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died nearly two years later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978.\n\nJohn Pudney's daughter Tessa (1942-2004) was an academic best known for her work in media studies at [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. She married the film critic [[V. F. Perkins|Victor Perkins]] in the 1960s.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/nov/04/guardianobituaries.obituaries Tessa Perkins obituary in ''The Guardian'', 4 November 2004]</ref> Their son, [[Toby Perkins]], is the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Chesterfield]].\n\n==Works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''Spring Encounter'' (1933)\n*''Open the Sky'' ([[Boriswood]] 1934)\n*''Dispersal Point and other Air Poems'' (1942)\n*''The Grass Grew All Round'' (1942)\n*''Beyond This Disregard'' (1943) poems\n*''South of Forty'' (1943) poems\n*''Ten Summers'': Poems 1933-1943 (1944)\n*''Almanack of Hope'': Sonnets (1944)\n*''Air Force Poetry'' (1944) (anthology, edited with [[Henry Treece]])\n*''Flight above Cloud'' (1944)\n*''World Still There'' (1945)\n*Selected Poems (1946)\n*''Low Life'' (1947)\n*''Commemorations'' (1948)\n*''Sixpenny Songs'' (1953)\n*Collected Poems (1957)\n*''The Trampoline'' (1959)\n*''Spill Out'': Poems and Ballads (1967)\n*''Spandrels'': Poems and Ballads (1969)\n*''Take This Orange'': Poems and Ballads (1971)\n*Selected Poems 1967-1973 (1973)\n*''Living in a One-Sided House'' (1976) poems\n*''Writers' Workshop'', poetry anthology publication, editor with [[Norman Hidden]] and [[Michael Johnson (editor)|Michael Johnson]] (from 1967)<ref>Durham University.
