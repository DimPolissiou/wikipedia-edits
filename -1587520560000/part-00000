When the NIT started, it was considered the premiere national college basketball tournament and remained on par with the NCAA Tournament through the mid 1950s, until the NCAA began giving automatic bids to conference champions in 1956.<ref>Miller, Ralph (1990). \"Ralph Miller: Spanning the Game.\" Sagamore Publishing LLC. p. 56. {{ISBN|0915611384}}. \"Had the Aggies lost one, we would have been forced to have a playoff, and that was the problem. We had already accepted a bid to play in the [1954] National Invitation Tournament (NIT). The tournament picture was much different then.

At the battle of Neuve Chapelle (10\u201312 March, 1915), he massed 340 guns.  The weight of this bombardment on a comparatively narrow front enabled the attackers to secure the village of Neuve Chapelle and 1600 yards of the German front line. The arrival of German reinforcements prevented further advance. Rawlinson concluded that an enemy's line of trenches could be broken  'with suitable artillery preparation' combined with secrecy.<ref>Robin Prior & Trevor Wilson, Command on the Western Front: the Military Career of Sir Henry Rawlinson 1914\u20131918 (Pen & Sword Books, Barnsley, 2004), P.56.</ref> He also drew a lesson for the future, that trench warfare called for limited advances: 'What I want to do now is what I call \"Bite & Hold\" \u2013 bite off a piece of the enemy's line like Neuve Chapelle & hold it against all counter-attacks...there ought to be no difficulty in holding against the enemy's counter attacks & inflicting on him at least twice  the loss that we have suffered in making the bite.'<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1915, Rawlinson was considered for command of [[First Army (United Kingdom)|British First Army]], in succession to Douglas Haig, but the command was instead given to [[Charles Carmichael Monro|Sir Charles Monro]].

Attention has focused on this first day, a British disaster for three of the five attacking corps, although the battle lasted 141 days and drew in four German armies. On 1 July, British forces were repulsed by the Germans along most of the front, sustaining 57,000 casualties. The heaviest defeats were in front of [[Pozi\u00e8res]] and [[Thiepval]]. By the afternoon Rawlinson was aware of much of the disaster, but not of the casualties. By 3 July he knew 8,000 prisoners had been taken.<ref>Middlebrook, 226</ref><ref>Atwood, 'Rawlinson on the Somme', p. 76.</ref> On the Allied right, the British and French had more success. Here they had a better fire plan but limited objectives as a flank guard to a main advance further north.  This was more in keeping with Rawlinson's idea of \"bite and hold\". There is no documentary evidence that the corps commander on the right (southern) British flank, General [[Walter Norris Congreve|Walter Congreve]], telephoned Rawlinson to ask permission to advance beyond his set objectives or to send in cavalry.<ref>Middlebrook, 213, 226, 291</ref><ref>Atwood, 'Rawlinson on the Somme', p.91note111.</ref>\n\nThe principal cause of the defeat, in addition to the skill of German defenders, was the failure of the long and heavy preliminary artillery barrage to destroy the German barbed wire and trenches, except in the southern sector where heavy French guns assisted. It is not true that heavily laden British infantry were required to advance at a slow walk. The researches of historians Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson have shown that the majority of battalions were already out in No Man's Land before whistles blew.<ref>Robin Prior & Trevor Wilson The Somme (London, 2005), pp. 112\u2013118.</ref>  This was of no avail, except in the south, against skilful placing of German machine guns in enfilade positions and German artillery fire falling on British trenches to prevent reinforcements reaching the Ulster Division, who had penetrated the German position. Rawlinson's 'Tactical Notes', initially drafted by his chief of staff Archie Montgomery, were not prescriptive, but gave initiative to battalion commanders to choose their formations.<ref>Atwood, 'Rawlinson on the Somme', p. 74.</ref>\n\nHaig told Rawlinson to exploit success in the south. Fourth Army fought its way forward towards the second German line atop the Bazentin Ridge.  At first light on 14 July, following a night approach march, a two-day preparatory bombardment of over 375,000 shells and a five-minute intensive hurricane bombardment, the leading British attackers some within 100 yards of enemy lines stormed into the German position. Nearly all first line objectives were taken. The Germans suffered 2200 casualties and the British took 1400 prisoners.<ref> T.R. Moreman, 'The Dawn Assault \u2013 Friday 14th July 1916,' Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, vol LXXI, no. 287 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 180\u2013204.</ref> However, the British were unable to exploit this success, and a long period of difficult fighting followed. The Germans made excellent use of the woods on the battlefield, turning each into a strongpoint. Rawlinson mainly failed to intervene and coordinate attacks until late August and early September, when he massed guns and men, enabling brigades of the 16th Irish Division to capture Guillemont village.<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, p. 150.</ref>\n\nBy late September, superior British artillery and better tactics enabled the British to achieve a striking success in the Battle of Morval.  At the start of October, however, the rain and the temperature both fell, and the battlefield turned into a quagmire.  The only late success was gained by Hubert Gough's Fifth Army (formerly Reserve Army) capturing Beaumont Hamel.<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, pp. 157\u2013158.</ref>\n\nThe results of the Somme remain in dispute. Casualties on both sides were immense. There is evidence that the German Army suffered enormous damage from an increasingly effective British artillery aided by French and British air superiority over the battlefield.<ref>J.P. Harris, 'Douglas Haig and the First World War' (Cambridge, 2008), p.p. 242. </ref> \"The unprecedented English artillery fire on the Somme is filling the hospitals more than ever,\" wrote the wife of a German aristocrat. <ref>Princess Evelyn Blucher, An English Wife in Berlin (London, 1920), p. 154.</ref>Rawlinson contributed to this in his awareness of guns and aircraft, and his planning aided by his chief of staff for attacks on 14 July and 25 September. On and before 1 July and during most of August, however, he gave insufficient direction and did not consistently assert control over subordinate commanders.<ref>Robin Prior & Trevor Wilson, 'Command on the Western Front: the Military Career of Sir Henry Rawlinson 1914\u20131918 (Barnsley, 2004), Part IV, \"The Somme\", pp. 137\u2013260.</ref> Nonetheless, there was British optimism at the end of the Battle and General Sir Henry Wilson's formula for 1917 was \"two Sommes at once\".<ref>Major General C.E.

Q56530.jpg|thumb|Henry Rawlinson, second from the left, with King George V and senior officers in 1918]]\nOn 28 March, 1918, Rawlinson took over Fifth Army from Hubert Gough, sacked in the wake of the German \"March Offensive\"; his Fourth Army Staff joined him and Fifth Army became Fourth Army on 3 April. By this time the German Army's offensive, [[Operation Michael]], had been checked, and the Allies were preparing a counter-offensive. Following the success of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian]] attack at [[Battle of Hamel|Le Hamel]] on 4 July, Rawlinson proposed to Haig a larger attack, designed to force the Germans back from the city of [[Amiens]] and further to damage the German Army's weakening morale. At lunch on 16 July Haig agreed, saying he had already proposed such an operation.<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, p. 176.</ref> Rawlinson had learned from his experiences on the Somme. \"The immeasurable superiority of the planning for 8 August 1918 over that for 1 July 1916 testified to the distance the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|BEF]] had travelled in the interim.\"<ref>David Stevenson, ''With Our Backs to the Wall: Victory and Defeat in 1918'', Allen Lane 2011, 119</ref> The attack was to be on a relatively narrow front, with no prior bombardment and limited objectives. To ensure a breakthrough, Haig gave Rawlinson command of virtually the whole British [[Royal Tank Regiment|armoured forces]]. By this stage of the war British manpower was severely depleted, and to achieve the breakthrough, the 4th Army comprised four Canadian, five Australian, five British and one American division.<ref>Stevenson, 120</ref>\n\nThe Allies achieved complete surprise, and the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] proved a striking success. On 8 August, described by General [[Erich Ludendorff]] as \"the black day of the German Army\", the Allies took 12,000 prisoners and captured 450 guns. Both the German and Allied commands were struck by the collapse in German morale and the high number of Germans surrendering without a fight.<ref>Stevenson, 123</ref> Nevertheless, the Allies were still cautious about pressing their advantage too far. On 11 August Rawlinson advised Haig to halt the offensive.<ref>Stevenson, 125</ref>\n\nIn September, again commanding a mixed force of British, Australian and American divisions, Rawlinson led his Army in the successful Allied effort to break through the [[Hindenburg Line]] of German defences, a major part of the [[Hundred Days Offensive]]. Initial planning was by Monash, the Australian commander, but Rawlinson broadened the front and gave him more tanks. The Allied attack was preceded by a massive artillery bombardment. Allied success was most striking in the centre where 46th Division crossed the St Quentin Canal and stormed trenches beyond, advancing up to three miles and taking over 5,300 prisoners.<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, pp. 189\u2013191.</ref>\n\nFourth Army's advance enjoyed continued success in the Battles of the Selle and the Sambre and Oise Canal. In the Hundred Days, Rawlinson's men had gained 85 miles, taking 80,000 prisoners and 1,100 guns.<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, p. 200.</ref>\n\n==Later life and Indian Command==\nRawlinson was bestowed with many honours in reward for his role in the First World War. He was made a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order]] in 1917 and appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]] 1918. In August 1919 the [[Houses of Parliament]] passed a vote of thanks to him for his military service, and awarded him the financial sum from the [[Exchequer]] of \u00a330,000.<ref name=holmes>{{cite web|title=Biographical entry for Baron Henry Seymour Rawlinson|publisher=Holmes A-Court family history|year=2018|url=http://www.holmesacourt.org/hac/2/2686.htm}}</ref> In 1919, he was raised to the [[peerage]] as '''Baron Rawlinson''' of Trent in the [[Dorset|County of Dorset]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=31624 |date=31 October 1919 |page=13255|nolink=y}}</ref> and appointed a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]].<ref name=gcb/>\n \nRawlinson was again called on to organise an evacuation, this time of the Allied forces that had been [[North Russia Intervention|sent to Russia]] to intervene in the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref name=lh/> In November 1919 he became [[General Officer Commanding]]-in-Chief for [[Aldershot Command]].<ref name=lh/>\n\nIn 1920, Rawlinson was made [[Commander-in-Chief, India]]. Winston Churchill as Secretary of State for War was instrumental in securing his appointment, over-riding a tradition that the post alternated between officers from the British and Indian Armies. He told Lloyd George that the post should go to the best qualified officer and that his military advisors \"entirely supported my view that the best appointment we could make would be that of General Lord Rawlinson\".<ref>National Archives, WO31/15353,  'Appointment of Lord Rawlinson'</ref> He held the post until his death.<ref name=lh/> He faced severe challenges. Brigadier Dyer's ordering his men to shoot at a crowd at Amritsar, killing 387 unarmed Indians, left a deep legacy of bitterness. The 3rd Afghan War had ended, but there was continued fighting in Waziristan. A hugely expanded army faced postwar demobilisation and continued cost of modernisation. The new commander-in-chief was expected to introduce a measure of \"Indianisation\", giving commissions to Indians. Under the system of Dyarchy, Indians, generally opposed to military expenditure, took a share in government and Rawlinson would have to justify army budgets.  The Moplah Rebellion of 1921 brought widespread disorder. When [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] launched the movement of non-cooperation with the British on 1 August 1920, he wished to avoid popular violence, but in 1922 the campaign degenerated: a crowd attacked a police station at Chauri Chaura, set fire to the building and 22 or 23 policemen were burnt to death or hacked down by the crowd. Gandhi cancelled the campaign, but he and other leaders of the resistance were arrested.<ref>Jacobsen, Rawlinson in India, pp. pp. xxi\u2013xxiv and 1\u20136.</ref> Rawlinson certainly began his command believing that the Army would have to maintain order. On 15 July, he complained that:\n\n{{quote|Unless we, as a government, are prepared to act vigourously and take strong measures to combat the insidious propaganda of the extremists we are bound to have something very like rebellion in India before long... You say what you like about not holding India by the sword, but you have held it by the sword for 100 years and when you give up the sword you will be turned out. You must keep the sword ready to hand and in case of trouble or rebellion use it relentlessly.

In Waziristan, the British and Indian Field Force backed by aircraft put an end to the fighting, built roads and established a brigade base at Razmak.<ref>Brian Robson, Crisis on the Frontier: The Third Afghan War and the Campaign in Waziristan 1919\u20131920 (Staplehurst, 2004).</ref>  Rawlinson announced a scheme of \"Indianisation\" to the Legislative Assembly on 17 February, 1923. Its aim, he said, was to \"give Indians a fair opportunity of providing that units officered by Indians will be efficient in every way\". The Prince of Wales' Royal Indian Military College was founded at Dehra Dun in 1922, run on English public school lines, to encourage potential officer candidates.<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, pp. 224\u2013225.</ref>\n\nIn 1924, Rawlinson was appointed a [[Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India]]. By the end of his Indian command, he had reduced the Indian army in numbers and cost, but improved firepower, mobility and training.

At the battle of Neuve Chapelle (10-12 March, 1915), he massed 340 guns.  The weight of this bombardment on a comparatively narrow front enabled the attackers to secure the village of Neuve Chapelle and 1600 yards of the German front line. The arrival of German reinforcements prevented further advance. Rawlinson concluded that an enemy's line of trenches could be broken  'with suitable artillery preparation' combined with secrecy.<ref>Robin Prior & Trevor Wilson, Command on the Western Front: the Military Career of Sir Henry Rawlinson 1914-1918 (Pen & Sword Books, Barnsley, 2004), P.56.</ref> He also drew a lesson for the future, that trench warfare called for limited advances: 'What I want to do now is what I call \"Bite & Hold\" -- bite off a piece of the enemy's line like Neuve Chapelle & hold it against all counter-attacks...there ought to be no difficulty in holding against the enemy's counter attacks & inflicting on him at least twice  the loss that we have suffered in making the bite.'<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, pp. 117-118</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1915, Rawlinson was considered for command of [[First Army (United Kingdom)|British First Army]], in succession to Douglas Haig, but the command was instead given to [[Charles Carmichael Monro|Sir Charles Monro]].

That the bosh [sic] will break and that a debacle will supervene I do not believe...\" He was not satisfied that the wire was well cut and enemy trenches sufficiently \"knocked about\".<ref>Rodney Atwood, 'Rawlinson on the Somme, 'Centenary Perspectives on the Great War: Society for Army Historical Research Commemorative Special Publication on the First World War p. 74.</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Somme===\n[[File:General Sir Henry S Rawlinson.jpg|thumb|General Sir Henry Rawlinson, Bt, at [[British Fourth Army|Fourth Army]] HQ, Querrieu Chateau, July 1916]]\nThe Somme offensive was launched on 1 July 1916. Attention has focused on this first day, a British disaster for three of the five attacking corps, although the battle lasted 141 days and drew in four German armies. On 1 July, British forces were repulsed by the Germans along most of the front, sustaining 57,000 casualties. The heaviest defeats were in front of [[Pozi\u00e8res]] and [[Thiepval]]. By the afternoon Rawlinson was aware of much of the disaster, but not of the casualties. By 3 July he knew 8,000 prisoners had been taken.<ref>Middlebrook, 226</ref><ref>Atwood, 'Rawlinson on the Somme', p. 76.</ref> On the Allied right, the British and French had more success. Here they had a better fire plan but limited objectives as a flank guard to a main advance further north.  This was more in keeping with Rawlinson's idea of \"bite and hold\". There is no documentary evidence that the corps commander on the right (southern) British flank, General [[Walter Norris Congreve|Walter Congreve]], telephoned Rawlinson to ask permission to advance beyond his set objectives or to send in cavalry.<ref>Middlebrook, 213, 226, 291</ref><ref>Atwood, 'Rawlinson on the Somme', p.91note111.</ref>\n\nThe principal cause of the defeat, in addition to the skill of German defenders, was the failure of the long and heavy preliminary artillery barrage to destroy the German barbed wire and trenches, except in the southern sector where heavy French guns assisted. It is not true that heavily laden British infantry were required to advance at a slow walk. The researches of historians Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson have shown that the majority of battalions were already out in No Man's Land before whistles blew.<ref>Robin Prior & Trevor Wilson The Somme (London, 2005), pp. 112-118.</ref>  This was of no avail, except in the south, against skilful placing of German machine guns in enfilade positions and German artillery fire falling on British trenches to prevent reinforcements reaching the Ulster Division, who had penetrated the German position. Rawlinson's 'Tactical Notes', initially drafted by his chief of staff Archie Montgomery, were not prescriptive, but gave initiative to battalion commanders to choose their formations.<ref>Atwood, 'Rawlinson on the Somme', p. 74.</ref>\n\nHaig told Rawlinson to exploit success in the south. Fourth Army fought its way forward towards the second German line atop the Bazentin Ridge.  At first light on 14 July, following a night approach march, a two-day preparatory bombardment of over 375,000 shells and a five-minute intensive hurricane bombardment, the leading British attackers some within 100 yards of enemy lines stormed into the German position. Nearly all first line objectives were taken. The Germans suffered 2200 casualties and the British took 1400 prisoners.<ref> T.R. Moreman, 'The Dawn Assault -- Friday 14th July 1916,' Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, vol LXXI, no. 287 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 180-204.</ref> However, the British were unable to exploit this success, and a long period of difficult fighting followed. The Germans made excellent use of the woods on the battlefield, turning each into a strongpoint. Rawlinson mainly failed to intervene and coordinate attacks until late August and early September, when he massed guns and men, enabling brigades of the 16th Irish Division to capture Guillemont village.<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, p. 150.</ref>\n\nBy late September, superior British artillery and better tactics enabled the British to achieve a striking success in the Battle of Morval.  At the start of October, however, the rain and the temperature both fell, and the battlefield turned into a quagmire.  The only late success was gained by Hubert Gough's Fifth Army (formerly Reserve Army) capturing Beaumont Hamel.<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, pp. 157-158.</ref>\n\nThe results of the Somme remain in dispute. Casualties on both sides were immense. There is evidence that the German Army suffered enormous damage from an increasingly effective British artillery aided by French and British air superiority over the battlefield.<ref>J.P. Harris, 'Douglas Haig and the First World War' (Cambridge, 2008), p.p. 242. </ref> \"The unprecedented English artillery fire on the Somme is filling the hospitals more than ever,\" wrote the wife of a German aristocrat. <ref>Princess Evelyn Blucher, An English Wife in Berlin (London, 1920), p. 154.</ref>Rawlinson contributed to this in his awareness of guns and aircraft, and his planning aided by his chief of staff for attacks on 14 July and 25 September. On and before 1 July and during most of August, however, he gave insufficient direction and did not consistently assert control over subordinate commanders.<ref>Robin Prior & Trevor Wilson, 'Command on the Western Front: the Military Career of Sir Henry Rawlinson 1914-1918 (Barnsley, 2004), Part IV, \"The Somme\", pp. 137-260.</ref> Nonetheless, there was British optimism at the end of the Battle and General Sir Henry Wilson's formula for 1917 was \"two Sommes at once\".<ref>Major General C.E. Callwell, 'Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson: His Life and Diuaries (2 vols. London, 1927), pp. 296-297 quoting his diary of 14 November 1916.</ref> \n\nIn January 1917, Rawlinson was promoted to permanent [[General (United Kingdom)|general]] \"for distinguished service in the field\".<ref name=\"LG 29 December 1916\">{{London Gazette |issue=29886 |date=29 December 1916 |page=15 |supp=y |nolink=y}}</ref> For a period in 1917\u201318, he also commanded the [[British Second Army|Second Army]]. In February 1918 he was appointed British Permanent Military Representative to the inter-Allied [[Supreme War Council]] at [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/rawlinson.htm|title=Sir Henry Rawlinson|publisher=First World War|accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Battles of 1918===\n[[File:H.m. the King With British Army Commanders at Buckingham Palace. Q56530.jpg|thumb|Henry Rawlinson, second from the left, with King George V and senior officers in 1918]]\nOn 28 March, 1918, Rawlinson took over Fifth Army from Hubert Gough, sacked in the wake of the German \"March Offensive\"; his Fourth Army Staff joined him and Fifth Army became Fourth Army on 3 April. By this time the German Army's offensive, [[Operation Michael]], had been checked, and the Allies were preparing a counter-offensive. Following the success of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian]] attack at [[Battle of Hamel|Le Hamel]] on 4 July, Rawlinson proposed to Haig a larger attack, designed to force the Germans back from the city of [[Amiens]] and further to damage the German Army's weakening morale. At lunch on 16 July Haig agreed, saying he had already proposed such an operation.<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, p. 176.</ref> Rawlinson had learned from his experiences on the Somme. \"The immeasurable superiority of the planning for 8 August 1918 over that for 1 July 1916 testified to the distance the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|BEF]] had travelled in the interim.\"<ref>David Stevenson, ''With Our Backs to the Wall: Victory and Defeat in 1918'', Allen Lane 2011, 119</ref> The attack was to be on a relatively narrow front, with no prior bombardment and limited objectives. To ensure a breakthrough, Haig gave Rawlinson command of virtually the whole British [[Royal Tank Regiment|armoured forces]]. By this stage of the war British manpower was severely depleted, and to achieve the breakthrough, the 4th Army comprised four Canadian, five Australian, five British and one American division.<ref>Stevenson, 120</ref>\n\nThe Allies achieved complete surprise, and the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] proved a striking success. On 8 August, described by General [[Erich Ludendorff]] as \"the black day of the German Army\", the Allies took 12,000 prisoners and captured 450 guns. Both the German and Allied commands were struck by the collapse in German morale and the high number of Germans surrendering without a fight.<ref>Stevenson, 123</ref> Nevertheless, the Allies were still cautious about pressing their advantage too far. On 11 August Rawlinson advised Haig to halt the offensive.<ref>Stevenson, 125</ref>\n\nIn September, again commanding a mixed force of British, Australian and American divisions, Rawlinson led his Army in the successful Allied effort to break through the [[Hindenburg Line]] of German defences, a major part of the [[Hundred Days Offensive]]. Initial planning was by Monash, the Australian commander, but Rawlinson broadened the front and gave him more tanks. The Allied attack was preceded by a massive artillery bombardment. Allied success was most striking in the centre where 46th Division crossed the St Quentin Canal and stormed trenches beyond, advancing up to three miles and taking over 5,300 prisoners.<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, pp. 189-191.</ref>\n\nFourth Army's advance enjoyed continued success in the Battles of the Selle and the Sambre and Oise Canal. In the Hundred Days, Rawlinson's men had gained 85 miles, taking 80,000 prisoners and 1,100 guns.<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, p. 200.</ref>\n\n==Later life and Indian Command==\nRawlinson was bestowed with many honours in reward for his role in the First World War. He was made a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order]] in 1917 and appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]] 1918. In August 1919 the [[Houses of Parliament]] passed a vote of thanks to him for his military service, and awarded him the financial sum from the [[Exchequer]] of \u00a330,000.<ref name=holmes>{{cite web|title=Biographical entry for Baron Henry Seymour Rawlinson|publisher=Holmes A-Court family history|year=2018|url=http://www.holmesacourt.org/hac/2/2686.htm}}</ref> In 1919, he was raised to the [[peerage]] as '''Baron Rawlinson''' of Trent in the [[Dorset|County of Dorset]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=31624 |date=31 October 1919 |page=13255|nolink=y}}</ref> and appointed a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]].<ref name=gcb/>\n \nRawlinson was again called on to organise an evacuation, this time of the Allied forces that had been [[North Russia Intervention|sent to Russia]] to intervene in the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref name=lh/> In November 1919 he became [[General Officer Commanding]]-in-Chief for [[Aldershot Command]].<ref name=lh/>\n\nIn 1920, Rawlinson was made [[Commander-in-Chief, India]]. Winston Churchill as Secretary of State for War was instrumental in securing his appointment, over-riding a tradition that the post alternated between officers from the British and Indian Armies. He told Lloyd George that the post should go to the best qualified officer and that his military advisors \"entirely supported my view that the best appointment we could make would be that of General Lord Rawlinson\".<ref>National Archives, WO31/15353,  'Appointment of Lord Rawlinson'</ref> He held the post until his death.<ref name=lh/> He faced severe challenges. Brigadier Dyer's ordering his men to shoot at a crowd at Amritsar, killing 387 unarmed Indians, left a deep legacy of bitterness. The 3rd Afghan War had ended, but there was continued fighting in Waziristan. A hugely expanded army faced postwar demobilisation and continued cost of modernisation. The new commander-in-chief was expected to introduce a measure of \"Indianisation\", giving commissions to Indians. Under the system of Dyarchy, Indians, generally opposed to military expenditure, took a share in government and Rawlinson would have to justify army budgets.  The Moplah Rebellion of 1921 brought widespread disorder. When [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] launched the movement of non-cooperation with the British on 1 August 1920, he wished to avoid popular violence, but in 1922 the campaign degenerated: a crowd attacked a police station at Chauri Chaura, set fire to the building and 22 or 23 policemen were burnt to death or hacked down by the crowd. Gandhi cancelled the campaign, but he and other leaders of the resistance were arrested.<ref>Jacobsen, Rawlinson in India, pp. pp. xxi-xxiv and 1-6.</ref> Rawlinson certainly began his command believing that the Army would have to maintain order. On 15 July, he complained that:\n\n{{quote|Unless we, as a government, are prepared to act vigourously and take strong measures to combat the insidious propaganda of the extremists we are bound to have something very like rebellion in India before long... You say what you like about not holding India by the sword, but you have held it by the sword for 100 years and when you give up the sword you will be turned out. You must keep the sword ready to hand and in case of trouble or rebellion use it relentlessly. [[Edwin Montagu|Montagu]] calls it terrorism, so it is and in dealing with natives of all classes you have to use terrorism whether you like it or not.<ref>{{cite book|first=John |last=Newsinger|title=The Blood Never Dried: A People's History of the British Empire|publisher=Bookmarks Publications |year=2006|pages=113\u2013114|isbn=978-1905192120}}</ref>}}\n\nJohn Newsinger argues that \"there is no doubt that the great majority of the British in India, soldiers, officials, civilians, agreed with Rawlinson on this. A few months later he noted in his journal that he \"was determined to fight for the white community against any black sedition or rebellion\", and, if necessary, \"be the next [[Reginald Dyer|Dyer]]\". <ref>{{cite book|first=M |last=Jacobsen|title=Rawlinson in India|publisher=Stroud |year=2002|pages=12, 16|isbn=978-0750931410}}</ref> Nonetheless, with Gandhi temporarily behind bars and increasing economic stability as the 1920s advanced, Rawlinson had the scope to reduce the Army's strength, modernise its equipment and work closely with Viceroys Chelmsford and Reading to try to make dyarchy a success. In Waziristan, the British and Indian Field Force backed by aircraft put an end to the fighting, built roads and established a brigade base at Razmak.<ref>Brian Robson, Crisis on the Frontier: The Third Afghan War and the Campaign in Waziristan 1919-1920 (Staplehurst, 2004).</ref>  Rawlinson announced a scheme of \"Indianisation\" to the Legislative Assembly on 17 February, 1923. Its aim, he said, was to \"give Indians a fair opportunity of providing that units officered by Indians will be efficient in every way\". The Prince of Wales' Royal Indian Military College was founded at Dehra Dun in 1922, run on English public school lines, to encourage potential officer candidates.<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, pp. 224-225.</ref>\n\nIn 1924, Rawlinson was appointed a [[Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India]]. By the end of his Indian command, he had reduced the Indian army in numbers and cost, but improved firepower, mobility and training. In financial questions he had been hugely helped by Sir Bhupendra Mitra, who had financial details \"at his finger's ends\". <ref>Maurice, Life of General Lord Rawlinson, pp. 328 & 330-331.</ref> He had been appointed to succeed Lord Cavan as CIGS when he left India.<ref>Jacobsen, Rawlinson in India, p. 189.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nRawlinson died on 28 March 1925 at the age of 61 at [[Delhi]] in India, after a medical operation for a stomach ailment, although not long before he had played [[polo]] and [[cricket]] and seemed fit and well.<ref>The Times, 28 March, 1925, p. 12.

In March, 1920, he and Winston Churchill enjoyed a painting holiday together on the French estate of the Duke of Westminster. \"The General paints in water colours and does it very well,\" wrote Churchill. \"With all my enormous paraphernalia, I have produced very indifferent results here.\"<ref>Atwood, General Lord Rawlinson, p. 204.</ref> He married Meredith Sophia Francis Kennard (1861-1931) at St Paul's Church, [[Knightsbridge]], London on 5 November 1890, the marriage producing no children.
