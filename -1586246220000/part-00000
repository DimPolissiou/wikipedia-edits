At stake were the [[Regional Council (France)|regional councils]] in metropolitan and overseas France as well as the [[Corsican Assembly]] and inaugural seats in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Assembly of French Guiana|fr|3=Assembl\u00e9e de Guyane}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Assembly of Martinique|fr|3=Assembl\u00e9e de Martinique}}, all for a six-year term. The [[Departmental Council of Mayotte]], which also exercises the powers of a region, is the only region not participating in this election, having already been renewed on 2 April 2015. There are 18 Regional Presidencies at stake, with 13 in continental France and [[Corsica]], and 5 [[Overseas department|overseas]]. Though they do not have legislative autonomy, these [[Territorial collectivity|territorial collectivities]] manage sizable budgets. Moreover, regional elections are often taken as a mid-term opinion poll.\n\nThese elections were the first to be held for the redrawn regions- the 27 regions of France were amalgamated into 18, this went into effect on 1 January 2016.<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2014/12/17/la-carte-a-13-regions-definitivement-adoptee_4542278_823448.html La carte \u00e0 13 r\u00e9gions d\u00e9finitivement adopt\u00e9e], [[Le Monde]], 17 December 2014, accessed 2 January 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000030109622&categorieLien=id|title=LOI n\u00b0 2015\u201329 du 16 janvier 2015 relative \u00e0 la d\u00e9limitation des r\u00e9gions, aux \u00e9lections r\u00e9gionales et d\u00e9partementales et modifiant le calendrier \u00e9lectoral \u2013 Legifrance|publisher=|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref><!-- 2010 regions: 22metro + 5 OS=27 ; Mayotte was special ; 2016 regions: 13metro + 5 OS; OS case is poorly documented here, in :en: -->\n\n==Voting system==\n\nThe regional elections are held in direct universal suffrage using proportional representation lists. The election is held over two rounds, with majority bonus. The lists must be gender balanced by alternatively have a male candidate and a female candidate from the top to the bottom of the list. Only lists with as many candidates as available seats<ref>also compulsory in French municipal elections</ref> in every departement of the region may compete. Before [[2004 French regional elections|2004]], lists could be presented only at the departement level, allowing smaller parties (e.g. [[Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition]], [[Alsace d'abord]], [[Lutte Ouvri\u00e8re]], [[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|Revolutionary Communist League]]) to be represented as such in the regional councils and thus forcing major parties to enter into negotiations to rule some regions.\n\nFollowing the 1999 and 2003 electoral reforms, with a first implementation in [[2004 French regional elections|2004]], a [[Two-round system|two-round runoff voting]] system is used to elect the regional presidents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uk.ambafrance.org/French-regional-elections-results|title=French regional elections results|website=France in the United Kingdom - La France au Royaume-Uni|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}</ref> If no party gets at least 50% of the vote in the first round, a second round is held, which any party who got at least 10% in the first round may enter. Lists that obtain at least 5% of the vote in the first round may merge in the second round with a 'qualified list', which includes candidates from each merged list.\n\nAt the decisive round (first round if a list won 50%, the second round if not), the leading list receives a premium of 25% of the seats while the remaining seats are distributed among all lists who received at least 5% of votes. Thus, the majority bonus allows a leading list to have an absolute majority of seats in the Regional Council from one-third of votes in the second round. The seats are distributed among the lists at the regional level but within each list, seats are allocated by departement branch in proportion to the number of votes in each department.\n\n== Opinion polls ==\n{{Main|Opinion polling for the French regional elections, 2015}}\n\n==National results==\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2016}}\nFrance uses a two-round runoff system to elect the regional presidencies, and as such not all seats contested will see a candidate elected in the first round.\n\n===First round===\nThe first round election was held on 6 December 2015.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n! colspan=2|List !!

elections''' were held in [[France]] on 6 and 13 December 2015.  At stake were the [[Regional Council (France)|regional councils]] in metropolitan and overseas France as well as the [[Corsican Assembly]] and inaugural seats in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Assembly of French Guiana|fr|3=Assembl\u00e9e de Guyane}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Assembly of Martinique|fr|3=Assembl\u00e9e de Martinique}}, all for a six-year term. The [[Departmental Council of Mayotte]], which also exercises the powers of a region, is the only region not participating in this election, having already been renewed on 2 April 2015. There are 18 Regional Presidencies at stake, with 13 in continental France and [[Corsica]], and 5 [[Overseas department|overseas]]. Though they do not have legislative autonomy, these [[Territorial collectivity|territorial collectivities]] manage sizable budgets. Moreover, regional elections are often taken as a mid-term opinion poll.\n\nThese elections were the first to be held for the redrawn regions- the 27 regions of France were amalgamated into 18, this went into effect on 1 January 2016.<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2014/12/17/la-carte-a-13-regions-definitivement-adoptee_4542278_823448.html La carte \u00e0 13 r\u00e9gions d\u00e9finitivement adopt\u00e9e], [[Le Monde]], 17 December 2014, accessed 2 January 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000030109622&categorieLien=id|title=LOI n\u00b0 2015\u201329 du 16 janvier 2015 relative \u00e0 la d\u00e9limitation des r\u00e9gions, aux \u00e9lections r\u00e9gionales et d\u00e9partementales et modifiant le calendrier \u00e9lectoral \u2013 Legifrance|publisher=|accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref><!-- 2010 regions: 22metro + 5 OS=27 ; Mayotte was special ; 2016 regions: 13metro + 5 OS; OS case is poorly documented here, in :en: -->\n\n==Voting system==\n\nThe regional elections are held in direct universal suffrage using proportional representation lists. The election is held over two rounds, with majority bonus. The lists must be gender balanced by alternatively have a male candidate and a female candidate from the top to the bottom of the list. Only lists with as many candidates as available seats<ref>also compulsory in French municipal elections</ref> in every departement of the region may compete. Before [[2004 French regional elections|2004]], lists could be presented only at the departement level, allowing smaller parties (e.g. [[Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition]], [[Alsace d'abord]], [[Lutte Ouvri\u00e8re]], [[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|Revolutionary Communist League]]) to be represented as such in the regional councils and thus forcing major parties to enter into negotiations to rule some regions.\n\nFollowing the 1999 and 2003 electoral reforms, with a first implementation in [[2004 French regional elections|2004]], a [[Two-round system|two-round runoff voting]] system is used to elect the regional presidents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uk.ambafrance.org/French-regional-elections-results|title=French regional elections results|website=France in the United Kingdom - La France au Royaume-Uni|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}</ref> If no party gets at least 50% of the vote in the first round, a second round is held, which any party who got at least 10% in the first round may enter. Lists that obtain at least 5% of the vote in the first round may merge in the second round with a 'qualified list', which includes candidates from each merged list.\n\nAt the decisive round (first round if a list won 50%, the second round if not), the leading list receives a premium of 25% of the seats while the remaining seats are distributed among all lists who received at least 5% of votes. Thus, the majority bonus allows a leading list to have an absolute majority of seats in the Regional Council from one-third of votes in the second round. The seats are distributed among the lists at the regional level but within each list, seats are allocated by departement branch in proportion to the number of votes in each department.\n\n== Opinion polls ==\n{{Main|Opinion polling for the French regional elections, 2015}}\n\n==National results==\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2016}}\nFrance uses a two-round runoff system to elect the regional presidencies, and as such not all seats contested will see a candidate elected in the first round.\n\n===First round===\nThe first round election was held on 6 December 2015.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n! colspan=2|List !!

The French word \"ch\u00e2teau\" denotes buildings as diverse as a medieval fortress, a Renaissance palace and a 19th-century country house. Care should therefore be taken when translating the French word ch\u00e2teau into [[English language|English]], noting the nature of the building in question. Most French ch\u00e2teaux are \"[[palace]]s\" or \"[[English country house|country house]]s\" and not \"[[castle]]s\", and for these the English word \"ch\u00e2teau\" is appropriate. Sometimes the word \"palace\" is more appropriate. To give an outstanding example, the [[Palace of Versailles|Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles]], also called in French \u00ab\u00a0le palais de Versailles\u00a0\u00bb is so called because it was located in the countryside when it was built, but it does not bear any resemblance to a castle, so it is usually known in English as the Palace of Versailles. In French where clarification is needed, the term ''ch\u00e2teau fort'' is used to describe a castle, such as [[Ch\u00e2teau de Roquetaillade|Ch\u00e2teau fort de Roquetaillade]].\n\nThe [[urban area|urban]] counterpart of ''ch\u00e2teau'' is ''[[palace|palais]]'', which in French is usually applied only to grand houses in a city. This usage is again different from that of the term \"palace\" in English, where there is no requirement that a palace must be in a city, but the word is rarely used for buildings other than the grandest royal residences.  The expression ''[[h\u00f4tel particulier]]'' is used for an urban \"private house\" of a grand sort.<ref name=\"Applefield2010\">{{cite book |last=Applefield |first=David |title=The Unofficial Guide to Paris |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ylPVM25SukC&pg=PA112 |date=6 April 2010 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-470-63725-8 |page=112}}</ref>\n\n==Concept==\nA ch\u00e2teau is a \"power house\", as Sir [[John Summerson]] dubbed the British and Irish \"[[stately homes]]\" that are the British Isles' architectural counterparts to French ch\u00e2teaux. It is the personal (and usually hereditary) badge of a ''family'' that, with some official rank, locally represents the royal authority; thus, the word ''ch\u00e2teau'' often refers to the dwelling of a member of either the French royalty or the nobility, but some fine ch\u00e2teaux, such as [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]], were built by the essentially high-[[bourgeois]]\u2014people but recently [[ennobled]]: [[tax farming (France)|tax-farmer]]s and ministers of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and his royal successors. However, the quality of the residences could vary considerably, from royal ch\u00e2teaux owned by royalty and the wealthy elite near larger towns<ref name=\"Giedion1982\">{{cite book |last=Giedion |first=Sigfried |title=Space, Time and Architecture: The Growth of a New Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHZnmKxkGMwC&pg=PA134 |year=1982 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-83040-0 |page=134}}</ref> to run-down ch\u00e2teaux vacated by poor nobility and officials in the countryside<ref name=\"Anderson2007\">{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=James Maxwell |title=Daily Life During the French Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAjhcHjfUisC&pg=PA2 |date=1 January 2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-33683-6 |page=2}}</ref> isolated and vulnerable.<ref name=\"Richardson2008\">{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Glenn |title=The Contending Kingdoms: France and England, 1420-1700 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFSqKelemSMC&pg=PA64 |date=1 January 2008 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=978-0-7546-5789-7 |page=64}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles (19387602929).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Cour d'honneur]]'' by [[Louis Le Vau]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles]], subsequently copied all over Europe]]\nA ch\u00e2teau was historically supported by its ''terres'' (lands), composing a [[manorialism|demesne]] that rendered the society of the ch\u00e2teau largely self-sufficient, in the manner of the historic Roman and Early Medieval [[villa]] system, (cf. [[manorialism]], [[hacienda]]). The open villas of Rome in the times of [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Maecenas]], and Emperor [[Tiberius]] began to be walled-in, and then fortified in the 3rd century AD, thus evolving to ''castellar'' \"ch\u00e2teaux\".<ref name=\"JordiSommer2007\">{{cite book |last1=Jordi |first1=Nathalie |last2=Sommer |first2=Lauren |last3=Sussman |first3=Anna |title=MTV France |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_qzLLQvdcgC&pg=PA146 |date=5 June 2007 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-7645-8770-2 |page=146}}</ref>   In modern usage, a ch\u00e2teau retains some enclosures that are distant descendants of these fortifying [[outwork]]s: a fenced, gated, closeable forecourt, perhaps a [[gatehouse]] or a keeper's lodge, and supporting outbuildings (stables, kitchens, breweries, bakeries, manservant quarters in the ''gar\u00e7onni\u00e8re''). Besides the ''[[cour d'honneur]]'' (court of honour) entrance, the ch\u00e2teau might have an inner ''cour'' (\"court\"), and inside, in the private residence, the ch\u00e2teau faces a simply and discreetly enclosed park.\n\nIn the city of Paris, the [[Louvre]] (fortified) and the [[Luxembourg Palace|Luxembourg]] (originally suburban) represented the original ch\u00e2teau but lost their ch\u00e2teau etymology, becoming \"palaces\" when the City enclosed them.

The French word \"ch\u00e2teau\" denotes buildings as diverse as a medieval fortress, a Renaissance palace and a 19th-century country house. Care should therefore be taken when translating the French word ch\u00e2teau into [[English language|English]], noting the nature of the building in question. Most French ch\u00e2teaux are \"[[palace]]s\" or \"[[English country house|country house]]s\" and not \"[[castle]]s\", and for these the English word \"ch\u00e2teau\" is appropriate. Sometimes the word \"palace\" is more appropriate. To give an outstanding example, the [[Palace of Versailles|Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles]], also called in French \u00ab\u00a0le palais de Versailles\u00a0\u00bb is so called because it was located in the countryside when it was built, but it does not bear any resemblance to a castle, so it is usually known in English as the Palace of Versailles. In French where clarification is needed, the term ''ch\u00e2teau fort'' is used to describe a castle, such as [[Ch\u00e2teau de Roquetaillade|Ch\u00e2teau fort de Roquetaillade]].\n\nThe [[urban area|urban]] counterpart of ''ch\u00e2teau'' is ''[[palace|palais]]'', which in French is usually applied only to grand houses in a city. This usage is again different from that of the term \"palace\" in English, where there is no requirement that a palace must be in a city, but the word is rarely used for buildings other than the grandest royal residences.  The expression ''[[h\u00f4tel particulier]]'' is used for an urban \"private house\" of a grand sort.<ref name=\"Applefield2010\">{{cite book |last=Applefield |first=David |title=The Unofficial Guide to Paris |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ylPVM25SukC&pg=PA112 |date=6 April 2010 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-470-63725-8 |page=112}}</ref>\n\n==Concept==\nA ch\u00e2teau is a \"power house\", as Sir [[John Summerson]] dubbed the British and Irish \"[[stately homes]]\" that are the British Isles' architectural counterparts to French ch\u00e2teaux. It is the personal (and usually hereditary) badge of a ''family'' that, with some official rank, locally represents the royal authority; thus, the word ''ch\u00e2teau'' often refers to the dwelling of a member of either the French royalty or the nobility, but some fine ch\u00e2teaux, such as [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]], were built by the essentially high-[[bourgeois]]\u2014people but recently [[ennobled]]: [[tax farming (France)|tax-farmer]]s and ministers of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and his royal successors.

Besides the ''[[cour d'honneur]]'' (court of honour) entrance, the ch\u00e2teau might have an inner ''cour'' (\"court\"), and inside, in the private residence, the ch\u00e2teau faces a simply and discreetly enclosed park.\n\nIn the city of Paris, the [[Louvre]] (fortified) and the [[Luxembourg Palace|Luxembourg]] (originally suburban) represented the original ch\u00e2teau but lost their ch\u00e2teau etymology, becoming \"palaces\" when the City enclosed them.

Versailles is therefore famous not only as a building, but as a symbol of the system of [[absolute monarchy]] of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Chateau de Montsoreau Museum of contemporary art.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Montsoreau]]\nFile:Chambord Castle Northwest facade.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]]\nFile:The Chateau near the Loire river - Saumur, France - panoramio.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Saumur]]\nFile:Castle Brissac 2007 02.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Brissac]]\nFile:AzeyParkseite.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau d'Azay-le-Rideau]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ch\u00e2teauesque]]\n* [[List of castles in France]]\n* [[List of ch\u00e2teaux in Languedoc-Roussillon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|ch\u00e2teau}}\n{{Commons|Ch\u00e2teaux en France}}\n*{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Ch\u00e2teau |volume=5 |short=x}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chateau}}\n[[Category:Ch\u00e2teaux| ]]\n[[Category:Ch\u00e2teaux in France|*]]\n[[Category:Architecture of France]]\n[[Category:French words and phrases]]\n[[Category:House types]]\n", "name_user": "Jamesmcmahon0", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: french \u2192 French", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau"}

The book recounts the discovery and treatment of [[Peyronie's disease]] and the emotional and relationship trauma leading to the recovery and healing of the sexual self and how disease and hardship has the ability to psychologically and spiritually force issues of transformation and acceptance.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n'''''BENT BUT NOT BROKEN''''', A Memoir, is the story of the body, the self, and the ways in which illness traumatizes and transforms. It is also one of the first memoirs about Peyronie\u2019s Disease, a disfiguring (but potentially treatable) penile condition that afflicts more than 5% of the male population. \nPlaywright and storyteller Don Cummings writes openly, fearlessly (and often hilariously) about the emotional and collateral damage caused by his bent penis, its effect on his partner and his own sense of self and sexuality. As the author moves from despair to raging hope on his quest to cure his ailing penis, he writes unflinchingly about the doctor visits, the excruciating treatments, and the acute anxiety caused by struggles with his domestic partner, a man who is supportive but not always understanding.

The book recounts the discovery and treatment of [[Peyronie's disease]] and the emotional and relationship trauma leading to the recovery and healing of the sexual self and how disease and hardship has the ability to psychologically and spiritually force issues of transformation and acceptance.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n'''''BENT BUT NOT BROKEN''''', A Memoir, is the story of the body, the self, and the ways in which illness traumatizes and transforms. It is also one of the first memoirs about Peyronie\u2019s Disease, a disfiguring (but potentially treatable) penile condition that afflicts more than 5% of the male population. \nPlaywright and storyteller Don Cummings writes openly, fearlessly (and often hilariously) about the emotional and collateral damage caused by his bent penis, its effect on his partner and his own sense of self and sexuality. As the author moves from despair to raging hope on his quest to cure his ailing penis, he writes unflinchingly about the doctor visits, the excruciating treatments, and the acute anxiety caused by struggles with his domestic partner, a man who is supportive but not always understanding. In the process, Cummings discloses powerful sexual reminiscences of his younger days\u2014''Penis as Madeleine''\u2014which include childhood precocity, promiscuity and substance abuse. Blissfully discordant domestic life, a harrowing kidnapping by a handsome stranger, a convoluted career as an actor and playwright, and interactions with [[Meryl Streep]] and other celebrities also figure into this universal narrative of survival and love. \nA dark comedy with a happy ending, '''''BENT BUT NOT BROKEN''''' reads like a medical mystery about the author\u2019s single-minded quest to cure his Peyronie\u2019s Disease, redeem his sexuality, and save his relationship.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' wrote, \"Cummings\u2019 skills as a writer are apparent from the beginning.
