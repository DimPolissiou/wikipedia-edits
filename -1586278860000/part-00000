His cabinet before the [[1960 Danish parliamentary election|1960 election]] was called the [[Cabinet of Viggo Kampmann I]] and the cabinet he formed after that election was called the [[Cabinet of Viggo Kampmann II]]. Before becoming Prime Minister he was [[Finance Minister of Denmark|Finance Minister]] from 30 September 1953 to 21 February 1960 in the [[Cabinet of Hans Hedtoft II]] and the [[Cabinet of H. C. Hansen I]] and [[Cabinet of H. C. Hansen II|II]].\n\nKampmann was born in [[Frederiksberg]] Denmark. He came from an [[academia|academic]] background and was the first academic to rise to a high rank in the Danish Social Democratic Party. Before becoming Minister of Finance he worked in the newly formed economical secretariat as the Financial Minister's closest adviser. He was first elected to the [[Folketing]] in 1953.\n\nWhen Prime Minister and Social Democrat [[H. C. Hansen]] died in February 1960 Kampmann succeeded him, creating the [[Cabinet of Viggo Kampmann I]]. H. C. Hansen had cooperated with the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]] and [[Justice Party of Denmark|Retsforbundet]], but Viggo Kampmann had problems working with Retsforbundet. After the [[1960 Danish parliamentary election]] Retsforbundet failed to get into [[Folketinget]] and the Danish Social Liberal Party went from 14 to 11 mandates. But the Social Democrats gained 6 mandates to 76, and Viggo Kampmann was able to form a minority government with the Danish Social Liberal Party, the [[Cabinet of Viggo Kampmann II]].\n\nA number of progressive reforms were introduced during Kampmann's time as Prime Minister. The Rehabilitation Act of March 1960 established a unified framework providing rehabilitation, aids, vocational training, and special training centres for partially disabled and handicapped persons. Under the New Public Assistance Act of May 1961 (which replaced the 1933 Act) public assistance no longer resulted in the loss of political rights and restrictions on marriage. In 1961, health insurance was made compulsory.\n\nIn 1962 the oms, the precursor to the [[Value added tax|moms]], was introduced.\n\nKampmann was one of the most intelligent and knowledgeable Danish Prime Ministers, though his conduct in office was erratic. Through most of his adult life he suffered from [[bipolar disorder]], and in his darker moments he tended towards alcoholism and frequently 'disappeared' from view for days at a time, leaving the government without its head. The press of the day, more discreet than their contemporary peers, never publicised any of this.\n\nViggo Kampmann resigned on 3 September 1962 after a series of heart attacks, and was succeeded by [[Jens Otto Krag]] as leader of the Social Democrats and as Prime Minister. In retirement he worked as a political commentator and head of the Press Complaints Commission. Viggo Kampmann died in [[Store Tor\u00f8je]] on 3 June 1976.\n\n==References==\n* Kristian Hvidt, ''Statsministre i Danmark fra 1913 til 1995'' (1995)\n* Growth to Limits: The Western European Welfare States Since World War II, Volume 4 edited by Peter Flora\n* https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jI0b97hNv1oC&pg=PA7&dq=denmark+health+insurance+1960&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9BJiVbiWFIOQ7Aay44KICA&ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=denmark%20health%20insurance%201960&f=false\n\n{{start box}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box|\n title=[[List of Finance Ministers of Denmark|Finance Minister of Denmark]]|\n before=[[Hans Christian Hansen]]|\n years=16 September 1950 \u2013 30 October 1950|\n after=[[Thorkil Kristensen]]\n}}\n{{succession box|\n title=[[List of Finance Ministers of Denmark|Finance Minister of Denmark]]|\n before=[[Thorkil Kristensen]]|\n years=30 September 1953 \u2013 31 March 1960|\n after=[[Kjeld Philip]]\n}}\n{{succession box|\n title=[[List of Prime Ministers of Denmark|Prime Minister of Denmark]]|\n before=[[Hans Christian Hansen]]|\n years=21 February 1960 \u2013 3 September 1962|\n after=[[Jens Otto Krag]]\n}}\n{{s-ppo}}\n{{succession box|\n title=[[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Leader of the Danish Social Democrats]]|\n before=[[H.

Some of these people were students who, after completing their studies returned to their home country.\n\nAfter the lifting of emigration restriction from the [[People's Republic of China]] in the 1980s, people began leaving the Fuzhou area. Illegal immigration from Fujian province peaked at around 8,000 per month in June 1992.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/populationinternational/files/sp/SP70.pdf ]{{dead link|date=December 2016}}</ref> For the second half of 1992 illegal immigration it was about 2500 per month. Migrants were mostly men, but in 1992 around 20-30% of them were women and children. These arrivals were mostly unskilled, agricultural workers. About 80% of these people came from [[Changle County, Fuzhou]], with smaller numbers coming from [[Lianjiang County|Lianjiang]] and [[Minhou County|Minhou]] counties, as well as other places.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Chinese America : Class, Economy, and Social Hierarchy|first=Xiaojian|last=Zhao|page=2010}}</ref>\n\n==Businesses==\n===Restaurants===\nMany [[Chinese restaurant]] owners and workers are from Fuzhou.<ref name=\"baruch\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/wsas/academics/anthropology/documents/JCOGuestMotttoEBway.pdf |format=PDF |title=From Mott Street to East Broadway : Fuzhounese Immigrants and the Revitalization of New York\u2019s Chinatown |author=Kenneth J. Guest |website=Baruch.cuny.edu |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref> The [[Chinatown buses]] system originated as a means to transport workers from New York City to various parts of the East Coast and also parts of the Southeast. Restaurant owners usually adopted the established [[American Chinese cuisine]], which is somewhat based on [[Cantonese cuisine]], rather than serve [[Fujian cuisine]]. These restaurants are usually [[all-you-can eat buffet]]s and [[take-out]] restaurants.\n\n===Other===\nMany Fuzhounese people also work in the Chinatown [[garment industry]]. With time, however, the Fuzhounese population has become upwardly mobile.\n\n==Locations==\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2016}}\nHokchiu people in the US are almost singularly concentrated in the [[New York metropolitan area]], unlike other Chinese Americans and [[Asian American]] groups. The number of Fuzhounese in New York City and nationwide is notably difficult to enumerate precisely, since as many as fifty percent of Fuzhounese immigrants are undocumented and may be reluctant to respond to census takers.<ref name=\"baruch\"/> One estimate had put the number of Fuzhou people in New York City at over 70,000;<ref name=\"unreachednewyork.com\"/> however, Einhorn in 1994 estimated that as many as 100,000 Fujianese were living in New York at the time and that an additional 10,000 were entering New York each year. Data from the 2005-2009 [[American Community Survey]] suggests there are around 1,450 Fuzhou speakers in the United States, although the number is likely to be far greater as most respondents simply wrote \"Chinese\".\n\n===New York City===\n====Manhattan's Chinatown and Lower East Side====\nDuring the 1980s, growing numbers of Fuzhou immigrants started arriving into [[Manhattan's Chinatown]]. Due to the fact that Manhattan's Chinatown was mostly [[Cantonese]] speaking at the time, many could not integrate well into the enclave and as a result, they began to settle on East Broadway and east of The Bowery, which at the time was not fully developed as being part of Chinatown and was rather an overlapping enclave of Chinese, Latinos, and Jewish populations. Many of the earlier Fuzhou immigrants learned to speak Cantonese in order to get a job and interact with the then Cantonese dominated Chinatown.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Chinese America: Class, Economy, and Social Hierarchy|first=Xiaojian |last=Zhao|page=114|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Lai_Becoming\">{{cite book|title=Becoming Chinese American: A History of Communities and Institutions|first=H. Mark |last=Lai}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=From Fujian to New York: Understanding the New Chinese Immigration|publisher= The Johns Hopkins University Press |year= 2001 |first=1 Zai|last1= Liang |first2=Wenzhen |last2=Ye }}</ref> Slowly, the Little Fuzhou enclave emerged on the eastern borderline of Chinatown, which was still overlapped with a remaining Latino and Jewish populations and then eventually it became fully Chinese populated and fully part of Manhattan's Chinatown. However, it resulted in Manhattan's Chinatown becoming subdivided into the older established Cantonese Chinatown in the western portion of Manhattan's Chinatown and newly established Fuzhou Chinatown in the eastern portion of Manhattan's Chinatown; although some long time Cantonese residents, many are older generations and businesses still remain behind in the newly emerged Fuzhou Chinatown. \n[[File:East Broadway jeh.JPG|right|thumb|[[Little Fuzhou]] (on [[East Broadway (Manhattan)|East Broadway]]) as seen from the [[Manhattan Bridge]].]]\n\nHokchiu people have founded business organizations such as the Fuzhou-American Chamber of Commerce and Industry.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Chinese America: Class, Economy, and Social Hierarchy|first=Xiaojian |last=Zhao|page=115|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]}}</ref> In 1998, businesspeople from [[Changle]] founded the Changle American Association, which has become one of the most influential community organizations.\n\n=====Shift to Brooklyn, Queens, and Nassau County=====\nHowever, due to the gentrification situation going on in Manhattan's Chinatown since the 2000s, the Chinese population and businesses are declining and moving from the original Chinatown to newer Chinatowns in New York, and the Fuzhou immigrants are also part of this decline as well. Many of Chinese in Manhattan's Chinatown are relocating to the newer Chinese enclaves in [[Chinatowns in Brooklyn|Brooklyn]], [[Chinatowns in Queens|Queens]], and [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]]. However, the Fuzhous that are moving out are mostly relocating to [[Chinatowns in Brooklyn|Sunset Park]], which now has the largest Fuzhou community in all of New York City, while the Cantonese are moving to [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn]]'s newer and growing Chinese enclaves, which are more primarily Cantonese populated.\n\n====Brooklyn's Sunset Park Chinatown==== \nLike Manhattan's Chinatown in the past, Brooklyn's [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]] Chinatown was primarily Cantonese, but was much smaller and less developed unlike Manhattan's Chinatown, which already had been very large and developed. With the [[gentrification]] and lack of available apartment units in Manhattan's Chinatown that came in the 2000s, the growing Fuzhou population shifted to Brooklyn's Sunset Park Chinatown to seek affordable housing and jobs. The shift of the Fuzhou immigration to Brooklyn's Sunset Park Chinatown dramatically expanded the Chinese enclave so prominently that it is now overwhelmingly Fuzhou populated and has far surpassed the size of the Fuzhou enclave in Manhattan's Chinatown.

Some of these people were students who, after completing their studies returned to their home country.\n\nAfter the lifting of emigration restriction from the [[People's Republic of China]] in the 1980s, people began leaving the Fuzhou area.

About 80% of these people came from [[Changle County, Fuzhou]], with smaller numbers coming from [[Lianjiang County|Lianjiang]] and [[Minhou County|Minhou]] counties, as well as other places.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Chinese America : Class, Economy, and Social Hierarchy|first=Xiaojian|last=Zhao|page=2010}}</ref>\n\n==Businesses==\n===Restaurants===\nMany [[Chinese restaurant]] owners and workers are from Fuzhou.<ref name=\"baruch\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/wsas/academics/anthropology/documents/JCOGuestMotttoEBway.pdf |format=PDF |title=From Mott Street to East Broadway : Fuzhounese Immigrants and the Revitalization of New York\u2019s Chinatown |author=Kenneth J.

Restaurant owners usually adopted the established [[American Chinese cuisine]], which is somewhat based on [[Cantonese cuisine]], rather than serve [[Fujian cuisine]]. These restaurants are usually [[all-you-can eat buffet]]s and [[take-out]] restaurants.\n\n===Other===\nMany Fuzhounese people also work in the Chinatown [[garment industry]]. With time, however, the Fuzhounese population has become upwardly mobile.\n\n==Locations==\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2016}}\nHokchiu people in the US are almost singularly concentrated in the [[New York metropolitan area]], unlike other Chinese Americans and [[Asian American]] groups. The number of Fuzhounese in New York City and nationwide is notably difficult to enumerate precisely, since as many as fifty percent of Fuzhounese immigrants are undocumented and may be reluctant to respond to census takers.<ref name=\"baruch\"/> One estimate had put the number of Fuzhou people in New York City at over 70,000;<ref name=\"unreachednewyork.com\"/> however, Einhorn in 1994 estimated that as many as 100,000 Fujianese were living in New York at the time and that an additional 10,000 were entering New York each year. Data from the 2005-2009 [[American Community Survey]] suggests there are around 1,450 Fuzhou speakers in the United States, although the number is likely to be far greater as most respondents simply wrote \"Chinese\".\n\n===New York City===\n====Manhattan's Chinatown and Lower East Side====\nDuring the 1980s, growing numbers of Fuzhou immigrants started arriving into [[Manhattan's Chinatown]]. Due to the fact that Manhattan's Chinatown was mostly [[Cantonese]] speaking at the time, many could not integrate well into the enclave and as a result, they began to settle on East Broadway and east of The Bowery, which at the time was not fully developed as being part of Chinatown and was rather an overlapping enclave of Chinese, Latinos, and Jewish populations. Many of the earlier Fuzhou immigrants learned to speak Cantonese in order to get a job and interact with the then Cantonese dominated Chinatown.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Chinese America: Class, Economy, and Social Hierarchy|first=Xiaojian |last=Zhao|page=114|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Lai_Becoming\">{{cite book|title=Becoming Chinese American: A History of Communities and Institutions|first=H.

However, it resulted in Manhattan's Chinatown becoming subdivided into the older established Cantonese Chinatown in the western portion of Manhattan's Chinatown and newly established Fuzhou Chinatown in the eastern portion of Manhattan's Chinatown; although some long time Cantonese residents, many are older generations and businesses still remain behind in the newly emerged Fuzhou Chinatown. \n[[File:East Broadway jeh.JPG|right|thumb|[[Little Fuzhou]] (on [[East Broadway (Manhattan)|East Broadway]]) as seen from the [[Manhattan Bridge]].]]\n\nHokchiu people have founded business organizations such as the Fuzhou-American Chamber of Commerce and Industry.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Chinese America: Class, Economy, and Social Hierarchy|first=Xiaojian |last=Zhao|page=115|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]}}</ref> In 1998, businesspeople from [[Changle]] founded the Changle American Association, which has become one of the most influential community organizations.\n\n=====Shift to Brooklyn, Queens, and Nassau County=====\nHowever, due to the gentrification situation going on in Manhattan's Chinatown since the 2000s, the Chinese population and businesses are declining and moving from the original Chinatown to newer Chinatowns in New York, and the Fuzhou immigrants are also part of this decline as well. Many of Chinese in Manhattan's Chinatown are relocating to the newer Chinese enclaves in [[Chinatowns in Brooklyn|Brooklyn]], [[Chinatowns in Queens|Queens]], and [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]]. However, the Fuzhous that are moving out are mostly relocating to [[Chinatowns in Brooklyn|Sunset Park]], which now has the largest Fuzhou community in all of New York City, while the Cantonese are moving to [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn]]'s newer and growing Chinese enclaves, which are more primarily Cantonese populated.\n\n====Brooklyn's Sunset Park Chinatown==== \nLike Manhattan's Chinatown in the past, Brooklyn's [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]] Chinatown was primarily Cantonese, but was much smaller and less developed unlike Manhattan's Chinatown, which already had been very large and developed. With the [[gentrification]] and lack of available apartment units in Manhattan's Chinatown that came in the 2000s, the growing Fuzhou population shifted to Brooklyn's Sunset Park Chinatown to seek affordable housing and jobs. The shift of the Fuzhou immigration to Brooklyn's Sunset Park Chinatown dramatically expanded the Chinese enclave so prominently that it is now overwhelmingly Fuzhou populated and has far surpassed the size of the Fuzhou enclave in Manhattan's Chinatown. In addition, the Brooklyn Sunset Park Chinatown has overall surpassed the size of Manhattan's Chinatown. Unlike in Brooklyn's Sunset Park Chinatown, where the Fuzhou population has managed to dominate the whole enclave and still quickly growing, the Fuzhou enclave in Manhattan's Chinatown only managed to occupy the eastern portion while the western portion of Manhattan's Chinatown still remains primarily Cantonese.\n\n==Population==\n===Political views===\nCompared to previous Chinese immigrants, Fuzhou Americans tend to have a more favorable view of the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref>Becoming Chinese American</ref> \n\nWhile the majority of the Fuzhou population in the US came directly from Fuzhou, some Fuzhou Americans have also descended from the Hokchiu (Hokchia) diaspora in [[Southeast Asia]], particularly [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].\n\n===\"Left behind\" children===\nSome Fuzhounese people give birth to children in the US, and then send their young children back to their hometowns because they are unable to raise children and work at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.childreninneedclub.com/little-americans-in-fuzhou |title=Children in Need - Little Americans in Fuzhou |website=Childreninneedclub.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref> Because of [[jus soli]] laws these children automatically gain [[American citizenship]].

The [[gort cloud]] refers to the green community that provides support and a market to green brands.\n\n== Consumer demand ==\nIn recent decades, there has been increasing interest in [[environmental protection|protecting the environment]] and [[sustainability]] when it comes to the [[world economy|world's markets]]. Due to [[global warming]] and the immense amount of [[environmental pollution]] attributed to factory manufacturing, the world has observed the rise in [[environmental issues]] (Chen, 2011). In response to society\u2019s concerns, this has seen an increasing number of companies adopting green brands to front [[environmental responsibility]]. In turn, products and services of green brands have recently been seen to have a perfectly inelastic demand because people are prepared to support and pay a higher price for a sustainable image (Chen, 2011).\n\nThrough a consumer study taken in 1999, it was discovered that environmental issues are ranked above [[human rights]], [[animal rights]] and [[welfare]] issues (Wheale & Hinton, 2007). This information shows growing consumer demand of companies providing goods and services that preserve the environment and adopt a \u201cgreen\u201d approach to business. In a similar study, according to Iannuzzi (2011), a compelling global demand for \u201cgreener products\u201d was demonstrated by over 60% of all countries studied, further demonstrating the desire of environmentally friendly green brands. In the study, environmental awareness was placed among the most vital product traits that consumers valued when purchasing, along with minimising toxic and [[hazardous substances]], water preservation and recycling (Iannuzzi, 2011). Green brands are ultimately more attractive to a lot of consumers nowadays, and committing to such sustainability is now essential to stay competitive.\n\nBecause concern for the environment is now a pivotal element in consumer decision-making, studies have found that the demand for green brands is higher than ever before (Ahmad & Thyagaraj, n.d.). A number of studies have also suggested that such a demand for greener products is due to consumers\u2019 self-expressive benefits. When supporting green brands, customers believe this determines their role in society and as stated by Ahmad and Thyagaraj (n.d.), this gives [[consumer satisfaction|consumers satisfaction]] that they are perceived as having an [[eco-friendly]] attitude. Various components have been stipulated as effects on conscious consumer behavior such as changing perspectives, awareness of environmental issues and greener products, and people\u2019s perceived environmental contribution in society. Such factors help green brands to segment, define and target their market (Baker, 2003).\n\nAn example of companies tackling environmental sustainability is the world\u2019s largest retailer, [[Walmart]]. Walmart has undertaken a sustainability strategy that called on their suppliers to supply greener products because they were adamant their customers demanded \u201cmore efficient, longer lasting and better performing products\u201d (Iannuzzi, 2011). Being a world-leading retailer, Walmart\u2019s green approach to business has put pressure on other companies to adopt similar practices that consumers are demanding.\n\nThe shift towards green brands is a result of numerous factors such as organic products being more accessible, [[fuel-efficient]] and eco-friendly automobiles becoming increasingly prevalent, and countless consumers looking to support the environment and portraying a green image (Richards, 2013). The development of the greener approach to living has transferred into marketing and advertising and consumer markets, where enterprises are adopting this movement to attract customers and [[profit maximization|increase profits]] (Richards, 2013).\n\n== Marketing of green brands ==\nWhen it comes to [[marketing strategies]] of green brands, company officials want to understand the effects of being green has on their company and customers alike. Being a green brand alone differentiates a brand from the outset and opens new market opportunities. The [[Body Shop]] is an example of a competitive green brand that succeeds through understanding and providing the [[consumer demand]] for [[environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] products and their sound environmental performance (Baker, 2003). Green brands have also been profitable in [[niche market]]s where they can charge exclusive prices because conscious [[consumer]]s are prepared to pay.\n\nTo combine [[environmental concern]] into marketing strategy is called \u2018green marketing\u2019 where companies use a range of undertakings to satisfy the consumer demand for environmentally friendly products such as revamping advertising, product adjustment, altering production operations, [[sustainable packaging]] and of course [[recycling]] (Baker, 2003). By doing this, a green brand is creating further value, which is conveyed through their [[communication strategy]] (Danciu, 2015).\n\nGreen brands looking to secure their sustainable image within consumers minds must establish a philosophy that describes their use of [[renewable resources]], [[waste minimisation|minimising waste]], supplying safe goods and services and \"giving back to the environment\" (Saxena & Khandelwal, 2010). Environmental concerns should also be included in marketing plans. After segmenting the market, green brands can make contact with their target market through implementing strong integrated marketing communications (IMC), which conveys their value proposition to consumers (Saxena & Khandelwal, 2010).\n\nWhere a clean and green image is communicated, brands should be associated with environmental claims that are truthful in how their business practices impact on the surrounding environment (Danciu, 2015). Such claims can be relayed through [[green label]]ing colour schemes, packaging, and \u201cnature\u201d images through advertisements as well as on the Internet. Consumers need to be wary of [[greenwashing]] through marketing strategies that does not reflect any green qualities in the product itself.\n\nAnother area of marketing a green brand is making use of functional and emotional strategies to position a brand in consumers\u2019 minds. The functional characteristic approach delivers information on how a brand's products and services are environmentally friendly, which creates brand connections for buyers and powerful cognitive perception of the company (Danciu, 2015). Such information should include a company\u2019s [[sustainable production]] process and [[ecological footprint]] in relation to its superiority to other competitors. The emotional approach for positioning focuses on emotions and alludes to a brand relationship with nature and the environment (Wang, 2016). It has been found that emotional strategies build brand loyalty very effectively because consumers feel they are helping preserve the environment through supporting sustainably made products (Danciu, 2015). Wang (2016) states that overall, a mixed strategy of using both emotional and functional approaches to market a green brand generates favorable brand relationships and commitment from consumers. It is noteworthy to mention that the most prosperous green brands are affiliated with either \u201calternative technology or a green corporate philosophy\u201d (Wang, 2016).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Ethical consumerism]]\n*[[Greenwashing]]\n*[[Informed consumer]]\n*[[Triple bottom line]]\n*[[Sustainability brand]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n* {{cite journal | last=Ahmad | first=Anees | last2=Thyagaraj | first2=K.

The functional characteristic approach delivers information on how a brand's products and services are environmentally friendly, which creates brand connections for buyers and powerful cognitive perception of the company (Danciu, 2015). Such information should include a company\u2019s [[sustainable production]] process and [[ecological footprint]] in relation to its superiority to other competitors. The emotional approach for positioning focuses on emotions and alludes to a brand relationship with nature and the environment (Wang, 2016). It has been found that emotional strategies build brand loyalty very effectively because consumers feel they are helping preserve the environment through supporting sustainably made products (Danciu, 2015). Wang (2016) states that overall, a mixed strategy of using both emotional and functional approaches to market a green brand generates favorable brand relationships and commitment from consumers. It is noteworthy to mention that the most prosperous green brands are affiliated with either \u201calternative technology or a green corporate philosophy\u201d (Wang, 2016).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Ethical consumerism]]\n*[[Greenwashing]]\n*[[Informed consumer]]\n*[[Triple bottom line]]\n*[[Sustainability brand]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n* {{cite journal | last=Ahmad | first=Anees | last2=Thyagaraj | first2=K.

A joint NASA-Boeing investigation team \"found the two critical software defects were not detected ahead of flight despite multiple safeguards\", according to an agency statement. \"Ground intervention prevented the loss of the vehicle in both cases\". Before re-entry, engineers discovered another software error that affected the thruster firings needed to safely jettison the Starliner's service module. The service module software error \"incorrectly translated\" the jettison thruster firing sequence. Both errors could have led to \"loss of vehicle\".<ref>https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/02/07/investigators-fault-boeing-for-potentially-catastrophic-software-errors-in-starliner-test-flight/ - 7 February 2020</ref>\n\n=== Second orbital flight test ===\n\nBoeing officials said on 6 April 2020, that the Starliner crew capsule will fly a second time without astronauts after software problems and other issues plagued a first test flight on 20 December 2019, preventing the ship from reaching the International Space Station. Boeing confirmed a report in the [[Washington Post]] that it will fly a second uncrewed demonstration mission \u2014 an Orbital Flight Test \u2014 before astronauts ride a Starliner into orbit in 2021. NASA said it accepted a recommendation from Boeing to fly a second unpiloted mission. The Washington Post reported the second Orbital Flight Test, with much the same objectives as the first, is expected to launch from Cape Canaveral \"sometime in October or November 2020\". Beleaguered by back-to-back crashes and the subsequent global grounding of the 737 MAX passenger jet and more recent headwinds from the slump in air travel due to the coronavirus pandemic, Boeing said it would fund the unplanned crew capsule test flight \"at no cost to the taxpayer\". Boeing told investors earlier this year it was taking a $410 million charge against its earnings to cover the expected costs of a second unpiloted test flight.<ref>https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/04/06/after-problem-plagued-test-flight-boeing-will-refly-crew-capsule-without-astronauts/ - 7 April 2020</ref>\n\n==List of spacecraft==\nAs of January 2020, Boeing plans to have three Boeing Starliner spacecraft in service to fulfill the needs of the Commercial Crew Program with each spacecraft expected to be capable of being reused up to ten times with a six-month refurbishment time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/starliner.htm|title=Starliner (CST-100)|website=Gunter's Space Page}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boeing.com/space/starliner/|title=CST-100 Starliner|website=Boeing}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:small\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Image\n! style=\"width:6em\" | Designation\n! style=\"width:6em\" | Name\n!

Amosov had no interest in martial arts until, at 16 years old, he joined the sambo club and trained at the club Hermes in [[Kiev]] under coaches [[Fedor Seredyuk]] and Vadim Korytny.\n\nAmosov made his first major success at the international adult level in 2012, when he won the European Sambo Fighting Cup and subsequently, achieved significant success in this single combat. He became world champion for WCSF three times (2013, 2014, 2015), and twice European champion for ECSF (2013, 2014). \n\nIn September 2014, he became Professional Combat Sambo champion of Eurasia by defeating [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] fighter [[Shamil Zavurov]] by submission. \n\nHe has repeatedly won [[combat sambo]] championships of Ukraine and in March, 2015, he became a sportsmaster of Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to his career as combat sambo athlete, Amosov regularly competes in mixed martial arts, (MMA).
