She went to parties at [[Paris Ritz|the Ritz]] and Crillion Club, frequented by politicians. Resident at 1 Place d'Alma, she worked briefly for the suave [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to France|British ambassador]] [[Duff Cooper]], whose wife, previously [[Lady Diana Manners]], was a former actress she used to visit on Broadway.

They frequented haunts of wealthy high society New Yorkers such as the Round Hill Country Club, Greenwich, Connecticut, and the [[River House (New York City)|River Club]] of New York City, and the homes of East Hampton, Long Island, with membership of the exclusive [[Maidstone Club]].

She played host to the rich and famous, often travelling abroad to raise funds for The Leys from parents and old boys. They invited the local dignitaries [[Edward Heath]] MP and the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]] with the [[Prime Minister of Singapore]] to an open day. In 1961, the [[Queen Mother]] came to tea, and then again to open an extension to buildings in 1973.\n\nOn the day that [[Harold Wilson]] resigned in 1970, she invited Heath to view the cricket pitches, which was reciprocated by a visit to [[10 Downing Street|No.10]]. Other royalty continued to attend from Bahrain and Tonga. She promoted the school with her own brand of conservatism, taking care of mental health and epilepsy in the school. With Eton's help they started a boat club, spent time at [[Cliveden]] and in 1962 included among their friends, the Astors.<ref>Trumpington, p.162</ref> The Macmillan era was rounded off with a world tour to drum up school business.\n\nThe couple had one son, Adam Campbell Barker born on 31 August 1955.

He was married in 1985 to Elizabeth Mary, daughter of Eric Marsden OBE of Stourpaine Manor, Blandford.<ref name=Telg9472666/>\n\n==Conservative politics==\nSince 1945, Mother and Baby Homes (otherwise known as [[maternity home]]s) had been places for the poor to wean their offspring.

In 1971/2, she served as [[Mayor of Cambridge]] which she described as a \"[[wikt:folderol|folderol]]\". That office was followed by appointment to the Cambridge bench as a [[Justice of the Peace]] from 1972. She granted the Freedom of Cambridge to [[RAF Oakington]], revived the town's market, installed a travel centre, and built an entrance hall to the railway station. She opened the [[Elizabeth Way Bridge]] with former Conservative cabinet minister [[Rab Butler]], [[High Steward (academia)|High Steward of Cambridge University]]. She arranged to \"twin\" Cambridge with three other great university cities, [[Florence]], [[Heidelberg]] and [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. She raised funds for [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]] and the Indo-Pakistan War Relief Fund, and undertook a swimathon.\n\nBefore the local government and administration of justice re-organisation, it was usual for the upper classes to sit on the bench as a matter of [[nobless oblige|public duty]].

That year marked a watershed in her political career. Stepping up a gear, she moved into a visibly national profile: her son was by now fully grown and starting a career. Continuing a gradual move up the career ladder into public life, Barker matured into a serious-minded public figure; she was appointed to the Board of Visitors of the women's gaol attached to [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville Prison]] in London. She was one of the few who could get along well with the leader of her party, [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>Walker, Andy.

The following year, 1976, she was made a General Commissioner for Taxes, based on a competent showing with the city's finances. She served on various public bodies, including chair of the Air Transport Users Committee (1979\u201380).<ref name=Telg9472666/> One of the first questions she asked in the Lords was about improving the airmail service, in which area she was regarded an expert.<ref>Lord Trenchard said \"like Lady Trumpington's expert knowledge in relation to air mail\".

Appointed as UK Representative to the [[UN Commission on the Status of Women]] it was her role to promote women's equality, marriage and divorce, healthcare, child-rearing, and human rights. She had an extensive address book in the United States; managing British interests on the Council in New York gave her a social profile that befitted her class status and ambition, but was nonetheless useful networking for the British Government.<ref>Burke's Peerage, 107th edition, vol.III.</ref> Belated recognition came from a Labour peeress:\n\n{{quote|On a different canvas, the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, then UK representative at the UN Commission on the Status of Women, helped to unite the international voice of women through her irresistible humour and sense of fun.

Thatcher recognised her capabilities when she was given a ministerial post. Despite being in the Lords as [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] at the [[Department of Health and Social Security]] from 1985\u201387, during which time she smoked cigarettes, and in spite of a deep concern for women's mental health with numerous charities, she would ''in perpetuum'' champion the cause of smokers to do what they wanted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/2004/dec/21/administration-and-works-committee#S5LV0667P0_20041221_HOL_153|title=Administration and Works Committee (Hansard, 21 December 2004)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com}}</ref> A stubborn streak of wilful independence was typical of the Thatcherite in her, which she never lost up until her final ''verbatim'' speech in the Lords.<ref>Weds 15 March 2005,\n[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/2005/mar/09/smoking-in-public-places#S5LV0670P0_20050309_HOL_17 Hansard01]\nsee also: [http://parlipapers.chadwyck.co.uk/hansard/fullrec.do?area=hcpp&resultNum=1&entries=116&source=config6.cfg&queryId=../session/1469189082_22372&fulltexthits=106 Hansard HL Deb 09 March 2005 vol 670 cc727-9]</ref>\n\nMoving to the Ministry of Agriculture, which suited her temperament better than social security, at the height of the Thatcher boom period from 1987 to 1989, she was made [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary]]. She was promoted to number two at the ministry in 1989 when the Prime Minister was still creating [[hereditary peerage]]s; she valued her friendship and support. She continued until 1992, serving during John Major's administration as [[Minister of State]] at the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]], when at age 69 she was the oldest female minister ever.<ref name=Telg9472666/><ref name=Debretts/>\n\nHer last role was once again as a Baroness-in-waiting to the Queen<ref name=\":0\"/> from 1992\u201397, when a change of government ended her career. Acting in the capacity as a whip and a courtier, she felt compelled to attend at the bedside of [[Sally Mugabe]] in a London Hospital. She also received [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], the last king of Afghanistan, on behalf of the Queen. On several occasions during the 1990s, Lady Trumpington became acquainted with the [[New Labour]] opposition leaders, [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] at Court. She was one of the few officials on hand in 1990 to recognise [[Mongolian Revolution of 1990|the new State of Mongolia]], subsequently travelling to Ulan Bator to deal with KGB-backed Russian investors on a construction project.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe [[Blair ministry|New Labour government]] therefore decided to appoint her an Extraordinary Baroness-in-Waiting from 1998, given her many years of experience at Court. During the Labour government, she was consistently on the side of traditionalists. She voted often in favour of [[university tuition fees]] and raising the cap to \u00a39,000; opposed constitutional reform, telling the Lords that she believed in the [[first past the post|first-past-the-post system]]; and against the ban on [[fox hunting]]. Lady Trumpington was broadly in favour of [[Brexit]], particularly the diminution of EU integration.

Consistently supportive of tough measures, she was appointed Trustee of [[Crimestoppers]] in 2004. This tied in closely with ongoing visitations to [[Pentonville Prison]], as Crimestoppers' emphasis was specific to schoolchildren and youth offending.

She raised funds for [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]] and the Indo-Pakistan War Relief Fund, and undertook a swimathon.\n\nBefore the local government and administration of justice re-organisation, it was usual for the upper classes to sit on the bench as a matter of [[nobless oblige|public duty]]. She re-entered politics in 1973, when she was elected to [[Cambridgeshire County Council]] for the Trumpington division but resigned in 1975 over the rapist scandal.<ref name=Debretts/>{{clarify|date=November 2018}} She sought election to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], and reached the short list for the [[Isle of Ely (UK Parliament constituency)|Isle of Ely]] for the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 election]].<ref name=Telg9472666/> (Dr [[Thomas Stuttaford]] was selected instead and lost to [[Clement Freud]].) That year marked a watershed in her political career. Stepping up a gear, she moved into a visibly national profile: her son was by now fully grown and starting a career. Continuing a gradual move up the career ladder into public life, Barker matured into a serious-minded public figure; she was appointed to the Board of Visitors of the women's gaol attached to [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville Prison]] in London. She was one of the few who could get along well with the leader of her party, [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>Walker, Andy.

The following year, 1976, she was made a General Commissioner for Taxes, based on a competent showing with the city's finances. She served on various public bodies, including chair of the Air Transport Users Committee (1979\u201380).<ref name=Telg9472666/> One of the first questions she asked in the Lords was about improving the airmail service, in which area she was regarded an expert.<ref>Lord Trenchard said \"like Lady Trumpington's expert knowledge in relation to air mail\".

Appointed as UK Representative to the [[UN Commission on the Status of Women]] it was her role to promote women's equality, marriage and divorce, healthcare, child-rearing, and human rights. She had an extensive address book in the United States; managing British interests on the Council in New York gave her a social profile that befitted her class status and ambition, but was nonetheless useful networking for the British Government.<ref>Burke's Peerage, 107th edition, vol.III.</ref> Belated recognition came from a Labour peeress:\n\n{{quote|On a different canvas, the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, then UK representative at the UN Commission on the Status of Women, helped to unite the international voice of women through her irresistible humour and sense of fun.

Thatcher recognised her capabilities when she was given a ministerial post. Despite being in the Lords as [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] at the [[Department of Health and Social Security]] from 1985\u201387, during which time she smoked cigarettes, and in spite of a deep concern for women's mental health with numerous charities, she would ''in perpetuum'' champion the cause of smokers to do what they wanted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/2004/dec/21/administration-and-works-committee#S5LV0667P0_20041221_HOL_153|title=Administration and Works Committee (Hansard, 21 December 2004)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com}}</ref> A stubborn streak of wilful independence was typical of the Thatcherite in her, which she never lost up until her final ''verbatim'' speech in the Lords.<ref>Weds 15 March 2005,\n[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/2005/mar/09/smoking-in-public-places#S5LV0670P0_20050309_HOL_17 Hansard01]\nsee also: [http://parlipapers.chadwyck.co.uk/hansard/fullrec.do?area=hcpp&resultNum=1&entries=116&source=config6.cfg&queryId=../session/1469189082_22372&fulltexthits=106 Hansard HL Deb 09 March 2005 vol 670 cc727-9]</ref>\n\nMoving to the Ministry of Agriculture, which suited her temperament better than social security, at the height of the Thatcher boom period from 1987 to 1989, she was made [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary]]. She was promoted to number two at the ministry in 1989 when the Prime Minister was still creating [[hereditary peerage]]s; she valued her friendship and support. She continued until 1992, serving during John Major's administration as [[Minister of State]] at the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]], when at age 69 she was the oldest female minister ever.<ref name=Telg9472666/><ref name=Debretts/>\n\nHer last role was once again as a Baroness-in-waiting to the Queen<ref name=\":0\"/> from 1992\u201397, when a change of government ended her career. Acting in the capacity as a whip and a courtier, she felt compelled to attend at the bedside of [[Sally Mugabe]] in a London Hospital. She also received [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], the last king of Afghanistan, on behalf of the Queen. On several occasions during the 1990s, Lady Trumpington became acquainted with the [[New Labour]] opposition leaders, [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] at Court. She was one of the few officials on hand in 1990 to recognise [[Mongolian Revolution of 1990|the new State of Mongolia]], subsequently travelling to Ulan Bator to deal with KGB-backed Russian investors on a construction project.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe [[Blair ministry|New Labour government]] therefore decided to appoint her an Extraordinary Baroness-in-Waiting from 1998, given her many years of experience at Court. During the Labour government, she was consistently on the side of traditionalists. She voted often in favour of [[university tuition fees]] and raising the cap to \u00a39,000; opposed constitutional reform, telling the Lords that she believed in the [[first past the post|first-past-the-post system]]; and against the ban on [[fox hunting]]. Lady Trumpington was broadly in favour of [[Brexit]], particularly the diminution of EU integration. She voted against the bill to make a referendum necessary to transfer powers back from EU to UK.<ref>{{cite web|df=dmy-all |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/peer/13538/baroness_trumpington|title=Baroness Trumpington - TheyWorkForYou|website=TheyWorkForYou}}</ref> Trumpington remained a principled opponent of soft measures on crime. Consistently supportive of tough measures, she was appointed Trustee of [[Crimestoppers]] in 2004. This tied in closely with ongoing visitations to [[Pentonville Prison]], as Crimestoppers' emphasis was specific to schoolchildren and youth offending. She opposed \"walking free\" and [[community sentencing]]; her disarming charm when discoursing about conditions in Britain's jails alerted the Lords perspective on the significance of public participation in [[crime reduction]] initiatives.<ref>{{cite web|df=dmy-all |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/2004/dec/08/crime-prevention#S5LV0667P0_20041208_HOL_343.|title=Crime Prevention (Hansard, 8 December 2004)|website=hansard.millbanksystems.com}}</ref>\n\nHer sense of order, propriety and taste got her into trouble: mocked by a Labour peeress for commenting on the drab and dishevelled appearance of the House of Lords, she more than once appeared a martinet for insisting on \"[[dress code]]\".<ref>Baroness Billingham HL Deb 23 November 2004 vol 667 cc5-20 Retrieved 22 July 2016.</ref> On another occasion she gave a [[V sign as an insult|V-sign]] to [[Tom King, Baron King of Bridgwater|Lord King of Bridgwater]] in the House of Lords, 10 November 2011 when he referred to her advanced age during a [[Remembrance Day]] debate.<ref name=Telg9472666/><ref name=\"theguardian.com\">[https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2011/nov/14/lords-v-sign-king \"House of Lords' V-sign makes X-rated viewing\"], The Guardian (London), 14 November 2011.</ref>\n\nWhen she tried to debate the \"plight of rural veterinary practices\", the peeress pretended to be deaf: she had long railed against the most absurd forms of political correctness.{{Clarify|date=January 2019}} In 2000\u201301, she was made President of the [[South of England Show|South of England Agricultural Show]], taking the opportunity to promote animal health, a cause for which she had in 1995 been awarded an Honorary Membership of the [[British Veterinary Association]], in response to her work in that ministry.<ref>Trumpington, p. 210</ref> Declining rural practices was caused directly by the government's farming policies; the yawning gap between policy and practice exposed weaknesses in the EFRACOM report.

Upon his return, his parents throw a party to celebrate his birthday. His governess as a child Mrs. Braganza comes to wish him with her granddaughter Bobby, whom Raj notices among the crowds attending his party. Mrs. Nath (played by [[Sonia Sahni]]) ignores Mrs. Braganza, which leads her to leave the party with her granddaughter in a rush.\n\nRaj opens his gifts the next day and finds Mrs. Braganza's gift, so he decides to go and meet her. Reaching there, her granddaughter Bobby opens the door for him, and it is love at first sight for him. During that visit, he mixes his book with Bobby's, so he goes to meet her at the library to exchange the books, and from that, both start their friendship. Raj and Bobby decide to go to see a movie but find out it is a full house. Then Raj gets an idea to go to a party. At the party, Bobby sees Raj talking to Nima (played by [[Aruna Irani]]) privately and thinks he is in love with her. As the story progresses, Raj realises that his relationship with the daughter of a poor fisherman is not taken kindly by his eccentric father. Upon Raj's insistence, Mr. Nath invites Jack Braganza to initiate talks of Raj and Bobby's wedding. But instead, Mr. Nath insults him and accuses Jack of using his daughter's beauty and charm to trap Raj for his money. He later offers Jack cash to stop Bobby from seeing Raj. Jack feels highly humiliated by this accusation and reciprocates by insulting Mr. Nath. Their talk enters a deadlock and spells doom for Raj and Bobby's tender love.\n\nMr. Nath engages Raj to a mentally challenged wealthy girl, Alka ([[Farida Jalal]]), to establish business ties with her rich father. But Raj runs away from home in order to unite with Bobby. They run away together. Mr. Nath advertises a reward for anyone who can help find his son. Prem Chopra ([[Prem Chopra]]) decides that he wants the money, and he and his goons kidnap Raj and Bobby. When they try to escape, Prem starts beating Raj. Mr. Nath and the police come to help, and they find Jack already there attempting to help Raj. Raj and Bobby run away from their fathers and jump over a waterfall. Mr. Nath and Jack jump into the water after them. Mr. Nath rescues Bobby, while Jack rescues Raj.\n\nThey realise that they love their children very much and don't want to stand in the way of their happiness. They accept each other's kids as their own and give their blessings to the union.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Rishi Kapoor]] as Raj Nath\n* [[Dimple Kapadia]] as Bobby Braganza\n* [[Prem Nath]] as Jack Braganza\n* [[Durga Khote]] as Mrs. Braganza\n* [[Pran (actor)|Pran]] as Mr. Nath\n* [[Sonia Sahni]] as Mrs. Sushma Nath\n* [[Aruna Irani]] as Nima\n* [[Prem Chopra]] as Prem Chopra\n* [[Farida Jalal]] as Alka 'Nikki' Sharma\n* [[Pinchoo Kapoor]] as Mr. Sharma\n* Raj Rani as Mrs. Sharma\n* [[Jagdish Raj]] as Police Inspector\n* [[Shashi Kiran]] as Shyam (Raj's college-mate)\n* [[Piloo J.

[[Dimple Kapadia]] and [[Neetu Singh]] were auditioned for the role of Bobby Braganza, but Dimple was finally selected; meanwhile, Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh did many films together later on and became one of cinema's best screen couples and later crowned their relationship with marriage.\n\n==Production==\nIn an interview in 2012, [[Rishi Kapoor]] stated, \"There was a misconception that the film was made to launch me as an actor.

Numerous films in the following years and decades were inspired by this plot. ''Indiatimes Movies'' ranks ''Bobby'' amongst the 'Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films'.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Kanwar, Rachna |title=25 Must See Bollywood Movies |date=3 October 2005 |url=http://movies.indiatimes.com/Special_Features/25_Must_See_Bollywood_Movies/articleshow/msid-1250837,curpg-11.cms |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015033800/http://movies.indiatimes.com/Special_Features/25_Must_See_Bollywood_Movies/articleshow/msid-1250837%2Ccurpg-11.cms |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 October 2007 |publisher=Indiatimes movies |accessdate=2010-11-08 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story is about the love between two [[Mumbai]] teenagers of different classes\u2014Raj Nath ([[Rishi Kapoor]]), the son of a rich businessman Mr. Nath (played by [[Pran (actor)|Pran]]), and Bobby Braganza ([[Dimple Kapadia]]), the daughter of a poor [[Goans|Goan]] Christian fisherman Jack Braganza (played by [[Prem Nath]]).\n\nRaj returns from his boarding school. Upon his return, his parents throw a party to celebrate his birthday. His governess as a child Mrs. Braganza comes to wish him with her granddaughter Bobby, whom Raj notices among the crowds attending his party. Mrs. Nath (played by [[Sonia Sahni]]) ignores Mrs. Braganza, which leads her to leave the party with her granddaughter in a rush.\n\nRaj opens his gifts the next day and finds Mrs. Braganza's gift, so he decides to go and meet her. Reaching there, her granddaughter Bobby opens the door for him, and it is love at first sight for him. During that visit, he mixes his book with Bobby's, so he goes to meet her at the library to exchange the books, and from that, both start their friendship. Raj and Bobby decide to go to see a movie but find out it is a full house. Then Raj gets an idea to go to a party. At the party, Bobby sees Raj talking to Nima (played by [[Aruna Irani]]) privately and thinks he is in love with her. As the story progresses, Raj realises that his relationship with the daughter of a poor fisherman is not taken kindly by his eccentric father. Upon Raj's insistence, Mr. Nath invites Jack Braganza to initiate talks of Raj and Bobby's wedding. But instead, Mr. Nath insults him and accuses Jack of using his daughter's beauty and charm to trap Raj for his money. He later offers Jack cash to stop Bobby from seeing Raj. Jack feels highly humiliated by this accusation and reciprocates by insulting Mr. Nath. Their talk enters a deadlock and spells doom for Raj and Bobby's tender love.\n\nMr. Nath engages Raj to a mentally challenged wealthy girl, Alka ([[Farida Jalal]]), to establish business ties with her rich father. But Raj runs away from home in order to unite with Bobby. They run away together. Mr. Nath advertises a reward for anyone who can help find his son. Prem Chopra ([[Prem Chopra]]) decides that he wants the money, and he and his goons kidnap Raj and Bobby. When they try to escape, Prem starts beating Raj. Mr. Nath and the police come to help, and they find Jack already there attempting to help Raj. Raj and Bobby run away from their fathers and jump over a waterfall. Mr. Nath and Jack jump into the water after them. Mr. Nath rescues Bobby, while Jack rescues Raj.\n\nThey realise that they love their children very much and don't want to stand in the way of their happiness. They accept each other's kids as their own and give their blessings to the union.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Rishi Kapoor]] as Raj Nath\n* [[Dimple Kapadia]] as Bobby Braganza\n* [[Prem Nath]] as Jack Braganza\n* [[Durga Khote]] as Mrs. Braganza\n* [[Pran (actor)|Pran]] as Mr. Nath\n* [[Sonia Sahni]] as Mrs. Sushma Nath\n* [[Aruna Irani]] as Nima\n* [[Prem Chopra]] as Prem Chopra\n* [[Farida Jalal]] as Alka 'Nikki' Sharma\n* [[Pinchoo Kapoor]] as Mr. Sharma\n* Raj Rani as Mrs. Sharma\n* [[Jagdish Raj]] as Police Inspector\n* [[Shashi Kiran]] as Shyam (Raj's college-mate)\n* [[Piloo J.

Under its founder [[Neil Bogart]], Casablanca was most successful during the [[disco era]] of the mid to late 1970s. The label currently focuses on Dance and Electronic music under the direction of [[Rob Stevenson]] and Brett Alperowitz.\n\n== Biography ==\nCasablanca was founded in 1973 by former [[Buddah Records]] executive [[Neil Bogart]], who named the label in homage to the 1942 film [[Casablanca (film)|''Casablanca'']]. He partnered with [[Cecil Holmes (record executive)|Cecil Holmes]], [[Larry Harris (record label exec)|Larry Harris]] and Buck Reingold in 1973, and was based in Los Angeles. The label was formed after they left Buddah and secured financing by [[Warner Bros. Records]] to start the venture. Casablanca became one of the most successful American labels of the 1970s, signing and releasing albums by such acts as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Village People]], [[Cher]], [[Lipps Inc.]] (with lead vocalist [[Cynthia Johnson]]), and [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] (featuring [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]). In 1976, the label merged with indie-film company Filmworks, Inc. headed by founder, [[Peter Guber]] to form '''Casablanca Record and FilmWorks, Inc.,''' which had hits with the movies ''[[The Deep (1977 film)|The Deep]]'' and ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]].''\n\nIn 1977, [[PolyGram]] acquired a 50% stake of Casablanca for $15&nbsp;million; in 1980, it purchased the remaining half. In 1980, one of the label's biggest acts, Donna Summer, departed to [[Geffen Records]] as she and Casablanca failed to agree on her musical direction for the future. That same year, PolyGram pushed Bogart out of Casablanca due to what it viewed as the label's overspending and accounting irregularities. The film division was separated from the label and renamed '''PolyGram Pictures'''. In the early 1980s, with Bogart no longer heading the label, Casablanca had hits with acts [[Lipps Inc]], [[Stephanie Mills]], [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]] (on sister label [[Chocolate City Records]]), and [[Irene Cara]], but it did not have the same level of success it had enjoyed in the 1970s. The label was eventually shut down by PolyGram with some of the artist roster and catalog absorbed into sister label, [[Mercury Records]].\n\nIn 1999, PolyGram (including its subsidiaries) was purchased by [[Seagram]] and then merged with Seagram's [[MCA Records|MCA Music Entertainment Group]] to form the [[Universal Music Group]]. In 2000, the Casablanca Records name was revived for a joint venture between Universal Music Group and [[Tommy Mottola]]. In a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' article, Mottola said that he chose the name as a homage to the original label, but that there was no connection between the old and new labels. Casablanca is currently a dance and electronic label under [[Republic Records]] headed by GM, Brett Alperowitz.\n\n== History ==\nBogart was the head of [[Buddah Records]], which was owned by the Viewlex Corporation. Also employed at Buddah Records were Holmes, Harris, and Reingold. Bogart had an unorthodox approach to the music business and he eventually grew tired of answering and conforming to Viewlex's business mode. In 1973, he arranged financing through [[Warner Bros. Records]] whereas he could start his own record label, which would be a subsidiary of Warner Bros. After much back and forth, the green light was eventually given by Warner and Bogart started the new label, bringing Harris, Holmes, and Reingold with him. Bogart called the label Casablanca as it was the name of his favorite film, and he also had the same last name as its star [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Also, since Warner Bros. owned the rights to the title of the film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Bogart knew there would be no lawsuit against him regarding the name Casablanca Records. The label's first signing was the rock group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], however, the label's first single was [[Bill Amesbury]]'s \"Virginia (Touch Me Like You Do)\" which became a minor hit on the US Hot 100. \"Butter Boy\" by [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]] and [[The Hudson Brothers]]' \"So You Are a Star\" proved to be Casablanca's first Billboard Top 40 hits.\n\nFrom the time of its inception, Casablanca did not quite fit within the Warner scope of music, especially with the signing of a then-new act known as Kiss. Bogart was also quite brash and sure of himself, which rubbed some Warner staffers the wrong way. Thus, Casablanca experienced lukewarm relations with Warner Bros., its parent company. Warner manufactured and distributed albums for its own acts, as well as for all its subsidiary labels. Both Casablanca and Warner handled promotion for Casablanca artists. However, a few years later when Warner began experiencing manufacturing problems, it began focusing mainly on manufacturing albums by Warner acts and not so much the subsidiaries. Thus, Casablanca found itself with only modest success with its releases as it had limited distribution. Once Bogart realized this, he took the issue to Warner head [[Mo Ostin]] who had not been aware of the lack of attention being given to the subsidiary labels. Ostin, who did not feel strongly about the Casablanca venture anyway, decided to handle the situation by completely breaking Casablanca Records away from Warner Bros. and giving Bogart ownership of the label, thus making Casablanca an independent label. Bogart was thrilled at the opportunity to own his own record company outright and being able to make all the decisions, but he did pay Warner Bros. back in full in installment payments for the Casablanca label as opposed to taking it for free.\n\nThe now-independent Casablanca Records was suddenly put in a tenuous financial situation as it still had yet to score a major hit album and no longer had the backing of Warner Bros. Casablanca was banking on the success of an upcoming album it was planning: a two-record set of audio highlights from television's ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. The album was entitled ''[[Here's Johnny: Magic Moments from the Tonight Show|Here's Johnny: Magic Moments from The Tonight Show]]'' and was released in November 1974.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 7, 1974|title=Top Album Picks - Pop|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1974/Billboard%201974-12-07.pdf|journal=Billboard|volume=|pages=60|via=}}</ref> Although the album was certified gold by the [[RIAA]] for shipments to stores of over 500,000 copies, the album did not sell well, and returns from retailers of unsold copies were high. Even the promotional copies were returned, initiating the joke that it shipped [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] and went back to the label [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]]. Casablanca had realized that even though ''The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'' was immensely popular, the show did not carry over well to recordings.<ref>{{Cite book|title=And party every day : the inside story of Casablanca Records|last=Harris, Larry Alan, 1947-|date=2009|publisher=Backbeat Books|others=Gooch, Curt., Suhs, Jeff.|isbn=9780879309824|location=New York|oclc=310398789}}</ref>\n\n== Notable artists ==\n\n=== Kiss ===\nCasablanca had released three albums by [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]: ''[[Kiss (Kiss album)|Kiss]]'' (1974), ''[[Hotter than Hell (album)|Hotter Than Hell]]'' (1974), and ''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]'' (1975), but all had failed to make a big impact on the charts. The label also did not experience heavy sales with albums by [[Angel (band)|Angel]], who was introduced to the label by [[Gene Simmons]] of Kiss, although that glam rock band did amass a following. The label would have been on the verge of bankruptcy when Bogart decided to release a live album by Kiss. Although the band's studio albums had not been strong sellers, the band had a reputation for performing exciting shows. Casablanca decided to try to capitalize on that reputation by releasing the double-live ''[[Alive! (Kiss album)|Alive!]]'' (1975) album. It became both Casablanca's and Kiss's first top ten album and was certified gold. Kiss's follow-up studio albums to ''Alive!'' were better sellers than its previous studio albums. ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' (1976), ''[[Rock and Roll Over]]'' (1976), and ''[[Love Gun]]'' (1977) were all certified platinum in the United States. The band's last studio album on Casablanca was ''[[Creatures of the Night]]'' in 1982.\n\n=== Donna Summer ===\nIn 1975, Casablanca signed [[Donna Summer]] and released her album ''[[Love to Love You Baby (album)|Love to Love You Baby]]'' which was certified gold. Summer had several gold and platinum albums on Casablanca in 1975\u20131979 and was the label's most successful act on the singles chart. She recorded eight Top 5 singles in a 19-month period. Summer had 10 gold singles, 2 went platinum, and a gold maxi-single with Casablanca. Summer was called in the American press \"The First Lady of Love\", a name that she disliked but that Casablanca marketed with great success. She was called the queen of the disco era. Her hits included \"[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer song)|Bad Girls]]\", the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] and [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] winning \"[[Last Dance (Donna Summer song)|Last Dance]]\", the Grammy winning \"[[Hot Stuff (Donna Summer song)|Hot Stuff]]\", and the hit single, \"[[I Feel Love]]\", co-written and produced by [[Giorgio Moroder]]. Her album ''[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer album)|Bad Girls]]'' achieved triple-platinum status. The label followed it with a greatest hits collection entitled ''[[On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I & II]]'', which was certified double platinum and was Summer's last album on Casablanca. She recorded three double-albums that reached the top of the charts in a 14-month period.\n\n=== Lipps, Inc. ===\nIn 1979 [[Lipps Inc.]], with [[Steven Greenberg (musician)|Steven Greenberg]] as writer, producer, and musician, and [[Cynthia Johnson]] on lead vocals, signed with Casablanca. The single \"Rock It\" was released, followed by the album ''[[Mouth to Mouth (Lipps Inc. album)|Mouth to Mouth]]''. The album included the No.1 hit \"[[Funkytown]].\" Funkytown spent four weeks at #1 on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and on the [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] charts in the United States. The 7\" single sold over two million copies within a few months and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|platinum record]] within the same year of its release.<ref name = \"Allmusic awards\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p26653/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic \u2013 Funkytown Charting]</ref> It reached #2 in the [[United Kingdom]]<ref>[http://www.everyhit.co.uk/ UK Charts] Search 'Funkytown'</ref> and was a hit throughout the world.\n\n=== Parliament ===\n[[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] was signed to Casablanca in 1973 due to Bogart's long-standing relationship with group leader [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]. Their relationship dated to Bogart's period at [[Buddah Records]]. Their first release for the label was in 1974 with the album ''[[Up for the Down Stroke]]''. The title song from the album gave Parliament its first top ten R&B hit. Their next album, ''[[Chocolate City (album)|Chocolate City]]'', sold approximately 150,000 albums in the Washington, D.C. area alone. But it was their next release, ''[[Mothership Connection]]'', that gave the group its first gold and platinum album. Parliament achieved either gold or platinum status with each album release until 1980. The group's hit singles included \"[[Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)]]\", \"[[Flash Light (song)|Flash Light]]\" (Casablanca's first R&B number one hit) and \"[[Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)]]\". The success of Parliament allowed George Clinton to develop another [[P-Funk]] spin off act known as [[Parlet]]. Casablanca bankrolled the extravagant P-Funk stage shows, including the \"Mothership Connection/[[P-Funk Earth Tour]]\" of 1976\u201377 and the [[Motor Booty Affair]] underwater tour of 1979. Parliament was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].\n\n=== Village People ===\n[[Village People]] is an American [[disco]] group best known for their on-stage [[costume]]s, catchy tunes and suggestive lyrics. The group was originally formed by French producers [[Jacques Morali]], [[Henri Belolo]] and lead singer [[Victor Willis]] following the release of the debut album, ''[[Village People (album)|Village People]]'', which targeted disco's gay audience.

Collaborations with vocalists such as [[Gallant (singer)]], [[Ray BLK]], and [[Bishop Nehru]] followed, and Lewis released Dusk, the first EP in a three-part series dedicated to club culture, in 2018.\n\n== Other events ==\nCasablanca started a subsidiary label in 1975 called [[Chocolate City Records]]. It was mainly overseen by Bogart's partner Cecil Holmes. The label focused on R&B, funk, and disco releases. Chocolate City's signings included the then-new act [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]] and veteran act [[Brenda & the Tabulations]].\n\nFrom 1976 to 1979, Casablanca also had another subsidiary label called Parachute Records. The label was run by former [[Motown Records]] promoter and [[Uni Records]] CEO [[Russ Regan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://45-sleeves.com/USA/parachute/para-us.htm |title=Parachute Records USA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315022119/http://45-sleeves.com/USA/parachute/para-us.htm |archivedate=March 15, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ewwI7AUeb2oC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |author=Larry Harris, Curt Gooch & Jeff Suhs |title=And Party Every Day: The Inside Story of Casablanca Records |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-87930-982-4}}</ref> Artists signed to the label included singer [[Randy Brown (musician)|Randy Brown]], the heavily sampled disco group 7th Wonder, and songwriter-author-poet [[Shel Silverstein]], who recorded one album for the label\u20141978's ''Songs and Stories''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/casablanca/parachute.html |author=Patrice Eyries, Mike Callahan & David Edwards |title=Parachute Album Discography |date=January 20, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe offices of Casablanca moved into the former [[A&M Records]] offices on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Casablanca's new offices were soon remodeled after the movie set of the film of the same name. Later, the record company merged with an indie production company called Filmworks, Inc., which was founded by former [[Columbia Pictures]] executive [[Peter Guber]]. The new company became known as '''Casablanca Record and Filmworks''', with Bogart still at its helm as president, while Guber became Chairman of the Board and head of its film division. Guber would remain with the company for two years. In 1977, PolyGram acquired a 50% stake in the independent Casablanca, which had been quite successful for several years.\n\nCasablanca remained very successful throughout the rest of the 1970s. But the label's rise and fall would both be dramatic instances. The rise came with the success of several acts such as Donna Summer, Kiss, Parliament, and [[Village People]], as well as some success from its subsidiary label and its film division. The fall began when the 1980s rolled in. The label was known to spend lavish amounts of money on parties, events, and promotion. Although this resulted in hit albums and singles, the profit margin suffered due to the carefree spending by the label. Casablanca spent lavish amounts of money on promoting its releases, which made its artists happy, but not necessarily PolyGram, which now owned a 50% stake in the label. When Casablanca's lavish spending habits were realized by PolyGram, it quickly made an offer to purchase the other 50% of Casablanca in 1980. Bogart accepted; however, he soon found out he would not be allowed to stay with Casablanca, and PolyGram released him from his post. He used the money he acquired from the sale to start [[Boardwalk Records]] and he signed then-new rocker [[Joan Jett]], who had experienced some success in Japan as a member of the group [[The Runaways]]. Bogart died from [[cancer]] in 1982 and Boardwalk Records folded.\n\n== Post-Bogart years ==\nCasablanca was not as successful without Bogart running the company. Its only notable releases from 1980 onward were the [[Robin Williams]] debut comedy LP ''Reality, What A Concept!'' (1981), the soundtrack to the movie ''[[Flashdance (soundtrack)|Flashdance]]'' (1983), and the final three Kiss LP's on Casablanca: ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'', ''[[Music from \"The Elder\"]]'', and ''[[Creatures of the Night]]''. [[Dusty Springfield]]'s sole release on Casablanca, 1982's ''[[White Heat (Dusty Springfield album)|White Heat]]'', came and went with little notice due to the label's mounting internal problems. The most successful act on the label during the 1980s was R&B singer [[Stephanie Mills]], who came to the label after PolyGram bought the [[20th Century Fox Records]] label and absorbed its artists and back catalog into Casablanca.  The last album released by the label was [[Animotion]]'s ''[[Strange Behavior (album)|Strange Behavior]]'' in 1986, which was a modest seller. By that time, PolyGram had folded Casablanca Records, moving some of its acts to [[Mercury Records]] and dropping others.\n\n== Official biography ==\nIn 2009, Casablanca co-founder Larry Harris released the definitive insider's history of the label with a book entitled ''And Party Every Day: The Inside Story of Casablanca Records''.\n\n== 2000 relaunch ==\nIn 1998, [[Seagram]] purchased PolyGram and merged it with [[MCA Inc.]] to create the [[Universal Music Group]]. Upon the merger, the original (pre-2000) Casablanca Records music catalog became a part of [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]], which folded in 2014. Reissues from the catalog became the responsibility of [[Island Records]].\n\nIn 2000, Universal and [[Tommy Mottola]], who had served as CEO of [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Records]] throughout the 1990s, partnered to launch a new record label that would be headed by Mottola and be part of the [[Universal Motown Republic Group|Universal Records Group]]. Mottola chose the name Casablanca, in homage to the Casablanca Records once run by Bogart. The label's first release was to be a girl-group first known as \"iNK\", but which later changed its name to \"NSS (Not So Sweet) 16\". The group, however, disbanded due to internal problems. NSS16's only single [[OopDeeWopDee]] was produced by hit music producer and Grammy award winner Greg Lawson and directed by [[Hakeem khaaliq]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/oopdeewopdee-single/id6596017 |title=Oopdeewopdee \u2013 Single by N.S.S. 16 on Apple Music |author= |date=April 13, 2004 |website=apple.com |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome of Casablanca's releases included albums by [[Lindsay Lohan]] in 2004, albums by Lohan and [[Brie Larson]] in 2005, and music by [[Mika (singer)|Mika]] in 2007, who scored a hit with the song \"[[Relax, Take It Easy]]\". In 2006, an unknown at the time teenage Zariah Avana was signed to the label. Mottola's label once again become inactive when Lohan and Larson moved to other labels within the Universal family.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Casablanca became active again (albeit in name only) with the releases of Mika's second album, ''[[The Boy Who Knew Too Much (album)|The Boy Who Knew Too Much]]'', and [[Ryan Leslie]]'s second album, ''[[Transition (Ryan Leslie album)|Transition]]''.\n\n=== Releases ===\n* ''[[Shall We Dance?

Under its founder [[Neil Bogart]], Casablanca was most successful during the [[disco era]] of the mid to late 1970s. The label currently focuses on Dance and Electronic music under the direction of [[Rob Stevenson]] and Brett Alperowitz.\n\n== Biography ==\nCasablanca was founded in 1973 by former [[Buddah Records]] executive [[Neil Bogart]], who named the label in homage to the 1942 film [[Casablanca (film)|''Casablanca'']]. He partnered with [[Cecil Holmes (record executive)|Cecil Holmes]], [[Larry Harris (record label exec)|Larry Harris]] and Buck Reingold in 1973, and was based in Los Angeles. The label was formed after they left Buddah and secured financing by [[Warner Bros. Records]] to start the venture. Casablanca became one of the most successful American labels of the 1970s, signing and releasing albums by such acts as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Village People]], [[Cher]], [[Lipps Inc.]] (with lead vocalist [[Cynthia Johnson]]), and [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] (featuring [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]). In 1976, the label merged with indie-film company Filmworks, Inc. headed by founder, [[Peter Guber]] to form '''Casablanca Record and FilmWorks, Inc.,''' which had hits with the movies ''[[The Deep (1977 film)|The Deep]]'' and ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]].''\n\nIn 1977, [[PolyGram]] acquired a 50% stake of Casablanca for $15&nbsp;million; in 1980, it purchased the remaining half. In 1980, one of the label's biggest acts, Donna Summer, departed to [[Geffen Records]] as she and Casablanca failed to agree on her musical direction for the future. That same year, PolyGram pushed Bogart out of Casablanca due to what it viewed as the label's overspending and accounting irregularities. The film division was separated from the label and renamed '''PolyGram Pictures'''. In the early 1980s, with Bogart no longer heading the label, Casablanca had hits with acts [[Lipps Inc]], [[Stephanie Mills]], [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]] (on sister label [[Chocolate City Records]]), and [[Irene Cara]], but it did not have the same level of success it had enjoyed in the 1970s. The label was eventually shut down by PolyGram with some of the artist roster and catalog absorbed into sister label, [[Mercury Records]].\n\nIn 1999, PolyGram (including its subsidiaries) was purchased by [[Seagram]] and then merged with Seagram's [[MCA Records|MCA Music Entertainment Group]] to form the [[Universal Music Group]]. In 2000, the Casablanca Records name was revived for a joint venture between Universal Music Group and [[Tommy Mottola]]. In a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' article, Mottola said that he chose the name as a homage to the original label, but that there was no connection between the old and new labels. Casablanca is currently a dance and electronic label under [[Republic Records]] headed by GM, Brett Alperowitz.\n\n== History ==\nBogart was the head of [[Buddah Records]], which was owned by the Viewlex Corporation. Also employed at Buddah Records were Holmes, Harris, and Reingold. Bogart had an unorthodox approach to the music business and he eventually grew tired of answering and conforming to Viewlex's business mode. In 1973, he arranged financing through [[Warner Bros. Records]] whereas he could start his own record label, which would be a subsidiary of Warner Bros. After much back and forth, the green light was eventually given by Warner and Bogart started the new label, bringing Harris, Holmes, and Reingold with him. Bogart called the label Casablanca as it was the name of his favorite film, and he also had the same last name as its star [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Also, since Warner Bros. owned the rights to the title of the film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Bogart knew there would be no lawsuit against him regarding the name Casablanca Records. The label's first signing was the rock group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], however, the label's first single was [[Bill Amesbury]]'s \"Virginia (Touch Me Like You Do)\" which became a minor hit on the US Hot 100. \"Butter Boy\" by [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]] and [[The Hudson Brothers]]' \"So You Are a Star\" proved to be Casablanca's first Billboard Top 40 hits.\n\nFrom the time of its inception, Casablanca did not quite fit within the Warner scope of music, especially with the signing of a then-new act known as Kiss. Bogart was also quite brash and sure of himself, which rubbed some Warner staffers the wrong way. Thus, Casablanca experienced lukewarm relations with Warner Bros., its parent company. Warner manufactured and distributed albums for its own acts, as well as for all its subsidiary labels. Both Casablanca and Warner handled promotion for Casablanca artists. However, a few years later when Warner began experiencing manufacturing problems, it began focusing mainly on manufacturing albums by Warner acts and not so much the subsidiaries. Thus, Casablanca found itself with only modest success with its releases as it had limited distribution. Once Bogart realized this, he took the issue to Warner head [[Mo Ostin]] who had not been aware of the lack of attention being given to the subsidiary labels. Ostin, who did not feel strongly about the Casablanca venture anyway, decided to handle the situation by completely breaking Casablanca Records away from Warner Bros. and giving Bogart ownership of the label, thus making Casablanca an independent label. Bogart was thrilled at the opportunity to own his own record company outright and being able to make all the decisions, but he did pay Warner Bros. back in full in installment payments for the Casablanca label as opposed to taking it for free.\n\nThe now-independent Casablanca Records was suddenly put in a tenuous financial situation as it still had yet to score a major hit album and no longer had the backing of Warner Bros. Casablanca was banking on the success of an upcoming album it was planning: a two-record set of audio highlights from television's ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. The album was entitled ''[[Here's Johnny: Magic Moments from the Tonight Show|Here's Johnny: Magic Moments from The Tonight Show]]'' and was released in November 1974.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 7, 1974|title=Top Album Picks - Pop|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1974/Billboard%201974-12-07.pdf|journal=Billboard|volume=|pages=60|via=}}</ref> Although the album was certified gold by the [[RIAA]] for shipments to stores of over 500,000 copies, the album did not sell well, and returns from retailers of unsold copies were high. Even the promotional copies were returned, initiating the joke that it shipped [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] and went back to the label [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]]. Casablanca had realized that even though ''The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'' was immensely popular, the show did not carry over well to recordings.<ref>{{Cite book|title=And party every day : the inside story of Casablanca Records|last=Harris, Larry Alan, 1947-|date=2009|publisher=Backbeat Books|others=Gooch, Curt., Suhs, Jeff.|isbn=9780879309824|location=New York|oclc=310398789}}</ref>\n\n== Notable artists ==\n\n=== Kiss ===\nCasablanca had released three albums by [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]: ''[[Kiss (Kiss album)|Kiss]]'' (1974), ''[[Hotter than Hell (album)|Hotter Than Hell]]'' (1974), and ''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]'' (1975), but all had failed to make a big impact on the charts. The label also did not experience heavy sales with albums by [[Angel (band)|Angel]], who was introduced to the label by [[Gene Simmons]] of Kiss, although that glam rock band did amass a following. The label would have been on the verge of bankruptcy when Bogart decided to release a live album by Kiss. Although the band's studio albums had not been strong sellers, the band had a reputation for performing exciting shows. Casablanca decided to try to capitalize on that reputation by releasing the double-live ''[[Alive! (Kiss album)|Alive!]]'' (1975) album. It became both Casablanca's and Kiss's first top ten album and was certified gold. Kiss's follow-up studio albums to ''Alive!'' were better sellers than its previous studio albums. ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' (1976), ''[[Rock and Roll Over]]'' (1976), and ''[[Love Gun]]'' (1977) were all certified platinum in the United States. The band's last studio album on Casablanca was ''[[Creatures of the Night]]'' in 1982.\n\n=== Donna Summer ===\nIn 1975, Casablanca signed [[Donna Summer]] and released her album ''[[Love to Love You Baby (album)|Love to Love You Baby]]'' which was certified gold. Summer had several gold and platinum albums on Casablanca in 1975\u20131979 and was the label's most successful act on the singles chart. She recorded eight Top 5 singles in a 19-month period. Summer had 10 gold singles, 2 went platinum, and a gold maxi-single with Casablanca. Summer was called in the American press \"The First Lady of Love\", a name that she disliked but that Casablanca marketed with great success. She was called the queen of the disco era. Her hits included \"[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer song)|Bad Girls]]\", the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] and [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] winning \"[[Last Dance (Donna Summer song)|Last Dance]]\", the Grammy winning \"[[Hot Stuff (Donna Summer song)|Hot Stuff]]\", and the hit single, \"[[I Feel Love]]\", co-written and produced by [[Giorgio Moroder]]. Her album ''[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer album)|Bad Girls]]'' achieved triple-platinum status. The label followed it with a greatest hits collection entitled ''[[On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I & II]]'', which was certified double platinum and was Summer's last album on Casablanca. She recorded three double-albums that reached the top of the charts in a 14-month period.\n\n=== Lipps, Inc. ===\nIn 1979 [[Lipps Inc.]], with [[Steven Greenberg (musician)|Steven Greenberg]] as writer, producer, and musician, and [[Cynthia Johnson]] on lead vocals, signed with Casablanca. The single \"Rock It\" was released, followed by the album ''[[Mouth to Mouth (Lipps Inc. album)|Mouth to Mouth]]''. The album included the No.1 hit \"[[Funkytown]].\" Funkytown spent four weeks at #1 on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and on the [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] charts in the United States. The 7\" single sold over two million copies within a few months and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|platinum record]] within the same year of its release.<ref name = \"Allmusic awards\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p26653/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic \u2013 Funkytown Charting]</ref> It reached #2 in the [[United Kingdom]]<ref>[http://www.everyhit.co.uk/ UK Charts] Search 'Funkytown'</ref> and was a hit throughout the world.\n\n=== Parliament ===\n[[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] was signed to Casablanca in 1973 due to Bogart's long-standing relationship with group leader [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]. Their relationship dated to Bogart's period at [[Buddah Records]]. Their first release for the label was in 1974 with the album ''[[Up for the Down Stroke]]''. The title song from the album gave Parliament its first top ten R&B hit. Their next album, ''[[Chocolate City (album)|Chocolate City]]'', sold approximately 150,000 albums in the Washington, D.C. area alone. But it was their next release, ''[[Mothership Connection]]'', that gave the group its first gold and platinum album. Parliament achieved either gold or platinum status with each album release until 1980. The group's hit singles included \"[[Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)]]\", \"[[Flash Light (song)|Flash Light]]\" (Casablanca's first R&B number one hit) and \"[[Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)]]\". The success of Parliament allowed George Clinton to develop another [[P-Funk]] spin off act known as [[Parlet]]. Casablanca bankrolled the extravagant P-Funk stage shows, including the \"Mothership Connection/[[P-Funk Earth Tour]]\" of 1976\u201377 and the [[Motor Booty Affair]] underwater tour of 1979. Parliament was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].\n\n=== Village People ===\n[[Village People]] is an American [[disco]] group best known for their on-stage [[costume]]s, catchy tunes and suggestive lyrics. The group was originally formed by French producers [[Jacques Morali]], [[Henri Belolo]] and lead singer [[Victor Willis]] following the release of the debut album, ''[[Village People (album)|Village People]]'', which targeted disco's gay audience.  The group's name refers to New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], at the time known for its large gay population,<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: Gay Sex in the 70s|url=http://kdhx.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=378&Itemid=142|year=2000|website=KDHX.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220020601/http://kdhx.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=378&Itemid=142|archivedate=December 20, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The characters were a symbolic group of gay and macho fantasy personas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.com/2008/05/ymca-oral-history/ |title=Spin Magazine Online: Y.M.C.A.

(song)|Y.M.C.A.]]\".\n\n=== MIKA ===\n[[Mika (singer)|MIKA]]'s debut single, \"[[Relax, Take It Easy]]\", was released in 2006. His second single, \"[[Grace Kelly (song)|Grace Kelly]]\", was released in January 2007 and debuted at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]], followed by his debut album, ''[[Life in Cartoon Motion]]'', in February 2007. The single reached number 57 in the US. Other singles released were; \"[[Love Today]]\", \"[[Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)]]\", \"[[Happy Ending (song)|Happy Ending]]\", and \"[[Lollipop (Mika song)|Lollipop]]\". Mika's second album, ''[[The Boy Who Knew Too Much (album)|The Boy Who Knew Too Much]]'', followed in September 2009. The first single from the album, \"[[We Are Golden]]\", made its debut at number four in the UK. \"[[Rain (Mika song)|Rain]]\" and \"[[Blame It on the Girls]]\" were released as the second and third UK singles with both peaking at number seventy-two. His third studio album, [[The Origin of Love]], was released in [[France]] on September 17, 2012, and in the [[United Kingdom]] on October 8, 2012. The album was preceded by an alternate lead single in each region. \"[[Elle me dit]]\" was first released in [[France]], whereas \"[[Celebrate (Mika song)|Celebrate]]\" served as the first official single for the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n=== Lindsay Lohan ===\n[[Lindsay Lohan]] signed on to the label in 2004, under the management of [[Tommy Mottola]].<ref name=\"billboard bio\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=lindsay lohan|bio=true}}|title=Lindsay Lohan Biography |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=April 22, 2010}}</ref> She released her debut studio album, ''[[Speak (Lindsay Lohan album)|Speak]]'' in December 2004, peaking at number 4 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]<ref name=\"allmusic speak\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r719491/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Speak''-Lindsay Lohan|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=April 22, 2010}}</ref> and eventually earning [[Platinum certification]].

The label was run by former [[Motown Records]] promoter and [[Uni Records]] CEO [[Russ Regan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://45-sleeves.com/USA/parachute/para-us.htm |title=Parachute Records USA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315022119/http://45-sleeves.com/USA/parachute/para-us.htm |archivedate=March 15, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ewwI7AUeb2oC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |author=Larry Harris, Curt Gooch & Jeff Suhs |title=And Party Every Day: The Inside Story of Casablanca Records |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-87930-982-4}}</ref> Artists signed to the label included singer [[Randy Brown (musician)|Randy Brown]], the heavily sampled disco group 7th Wonder, and songwriter-author-poet [[Shel Silverstein]], who recorded one album for the label\u20141978's ''Songs and Stories''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/casablanca/parachute.html |author=Patrice Eyries, Mike Callahan & David Edwards |title=Parachute Album Discography |date=January 20, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe offices of Casablanca moved into the former [[A&M Records]] offices on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Casablanca's new offices were soon remodeled after the movie set of the film of the same name. Later, the record company merged with an indie production company called Filmworks, Inc., which was founded by former [[Columbia Pictures]] executive [[Peter Guber]]. The new company became known as '''Casablanca Record and Filmworks''', with Bogart still at its helm as president, while Guber became Chairman of the Board and head of its film division. Guber would remain with the company for two years. In 1977, PolyGram acquired a 50% stake in the independent Casablanca, which had been quite successful for several years.\n\nCasablanca remained very successful throughout the rest of the 1970s. But the label's rise and fall would both be dramatic instances. The rise came with the success of several acts such as Donna Summer, Kiss, Parliament, and [[Village People]], as well as some success from its subsidiary label and its film division. The fall began when the 1980s rolled in. The label was known to spend lavish amounts of money on parties, events, and promotion. Although this resulted in hit albums and singles, the profit margin suffered due to the carefree spending by the label. Casablanca spent lavish amounts of money on promoting its releases, which made its artists happy, but not necessarily PolyGram, which now owned a 50% stake in the label. When Casablanca's lavish spending habits were realized by PolyGram, it quickly made an offer to purchase the other 50% of Casablanca in 1980. Bogart accepted; however, he soon found out he would not be allowed to stay with Casablanca, and PolyGram released him from his post. He used the money he acquired from the sale to start [[Boardwalk Records]] and he signed then-new rocker [[Joan Jett]], who had experienced some success in Japan as a member of the group [[The Runaways]]. Bogart died from [[cancer]] in 1982 and Boardwalk Records folded.\n\n== Post-Bogart years ==\nCasablanca was not as successful without Bogart running the company. Its only notable releases from 1980 onward were the [[Robin Williams]] debut comedy LP ''Reality, What A Concept!'' (1981), the soundtrack to the movie ''[[Flashdance (soundtrack)|Flashdance]]'' (1983), and the final three Kiss LP's on Casablanca: ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'', ''[[Music from \"The Elder\"]]'', and ''[[Creatures of the Night]]''. [[Dusty Springfield]]'s sole release on Casablanca, 1982's ''[[White Heat (Dusty Springfield album)|White Heat]]'', came and went with little notice due to the label's mounting internal problems. The most successful act on the label during the 1980s was R&B singer [[Stephanie Mills]], who came to the label after PolyGram bought the [[20th Century Fox Records]] label and absorbed its artists and back catalog into Casablanca.  The last album released by the label was [[Animotion]]'s ''[[Strange Behavior (album)|Strange Behavior]]'' in 1986, which was a modest seller. By that time, PolyGram had folded Casablanca Records, moving some of its acts to [[Mercury Records]] and dropping others.\n\n== Official biography ==\nIn 2009, Casablanca co-founder Larry Harris released the definitive insider's history of the label with a book entitled ''And Party Every Day: The Inside Story of Casablanca Records''.\n\n== 2000 relaunch ==\nIn 1998, [[Seagram]] purchased PolyGram and merged it with [[MCA Inc.]] to create the [[Universal Music Group]]. Upon the merger, the original (pre-2000) Casablanca Records music catalog became a part of [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]], which folded in 2014. Reissues from the catalog became the responsibility of [[Island Records]].\n\nIn 2000, Universal and [[Tommy Mottola]], who had served as CEO of [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Records]] throughout the 1990s, partnered to launch a new record label that would be headed by Mottola and be part of the [[Universal Motown Republic Group|Universal Records Group]]. Mottola chose the name Casablanca, in homage to the Casablanca Records once run by Bogart. The label's first release was to be a girl-group first known as \"iNK\", but which later changed its name to \"NSS (Not So Sweet) 16\". The group, however, disbanded due to internal problems. NSS16's only single [[OopDeeWopDee]] was produced by hit music producer and Grammy award winner Greg Lawson and directed by [[Hakeem khaaliq]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/oopdeewopdee-single/id6596017 |title=Oopdeewopdee \u2013 Single by N.S.S. 16 on Apple Music |author= |date=April 13, 2004 |website=apple.com |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome of Casablanca's releases included albums by [[Lindsay Lohan]] in 2004, albums by Lohan and [[Brie Larson]] in 2005, and music by [[Mika (singer)|Mika]] in 2007, who scored a hit with the song \"[[Relax, Take It Easy]]\". In 2006, an unknown at the time teenage Zariah Avana was signed to the label. Mottola's label once again become inactive when Lohan and Larson moved to other labels within the Universal family.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Casablanca became active again (albeit in name only) with the releases of Mika's second album, ''[[The Boy Who Knew Too Much (album)|The Boy Who Knew Too Much]]'', and [[Ryan Leslie]]'s second album, ''[[Transition (Ryan Leslie album)|Transition]]''.\n\n=== Releases ===\n* ''[[Shall We Dance?
