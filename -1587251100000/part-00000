Newly appointed manager [[Johan Cruyff]] believed that Menzo was one of the first goalkeepers who could also make his mark as a field player.\n\nMenzo then proceeded to remain an undisputed starter for seven full seasons, helping Ajax to the [[1989\u201390 Eredivisie|1989\u201390 national title]], as well as the [[1986\u201387 European Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup]]. However, after a game in the latter competition [[1992\u201393 UEFA Cup|the following season]], a 2\u20134 loss at [[AJ Auxerre]], during which he scored an [[own goal]] and was also directly related to another, he lost his place to youth graduate [[Edwin van der Sar]], and never regained it.\n\nIn the 1994 summer, Menzo signed with [[PSV Eindhoven]], where he backed up [[Ronald Waterreus]] for two seasons. The 33-year-old managed to revive his career in [[Belgium]] with [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse SK]], which he helped win one [[Belgian Pro League|league]] and one [[Belgian Cup|cup]], eventually amassing nearly 100 official appearances. For a brief period of time, he also played in [[France]] for [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux]], arriving in August 1997 to replace [[Gilbert Bodart]]. However, having lost his place to [[Ulrich Ram\u00e9]] (who would be the club's first-choice for more than one decade), he returned to Lierse, in January 1998.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, after a second spell at Ajax, Menzo joined amateur club [[AGOVV Apeldoorn]], helping it to the [[Hoofdklasse|amateur title]]. He retired from football at the end of the season.\n\n==International career==\nMenzo gained six [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]], the first arriving in 1989. He then spent nearly three years without any further appearances, but was summoned for the squads present at both the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 1992]], as third-choice.\n\nAfter legendary [[Hans van Breukelen]] retired from international play following the latter competition, Menzo was named the starter for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualification stages]] of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]]; following two unassuming performances, the 1\u20132 loss in [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and a 2\u20132 home draw against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], he was benched, and ultimately did not even made the squad at all ([[Ed de Goey]], [[Theo Snelders]] and van der Sar would be the goalkeepers listed as starter, reserve and third respectively).\n\n==Managerial career==\nIn the summer of 2004, after former Ajax teammate [[Marco van Basten]] became head coach of the national team, Menzo was named its goalkeeping coach, remained there for two years.<ref>[http://www.elfvoetbal.nl/nieuws/52732_menzo-keeperstrainer-af-bij-oranje Menzo keeperstrainer af bij Oranje] - ELF Voetbal {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\nWhen coach [[Peter Bosz]] left in June 2005, Menzo became AGOVV's manager, remaining in the position for only one season: AGOVV became a professional club in the [[Eerste Divisie|second division]], but he did not have the qualifications to exercise in that category, subsequently moving to Amsterdam-based amateur club [[Amsterdamsche FC]].<ref>[http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/stanley-menzo-verruilt-agovv-voor-afc.htm Stanley Menzo verruilt AGOVV voor AFC] - Voetbal International {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2005, Menzo received the necessary diploma to coach professional clubs.

He is the manager of the reserve team of [[Beijing Sinobo Guoan F.C.|Beijing Sinobo Guoan]] in China.\n\nMost of his professional career was spent at [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] (ten full seasons), appearing in more than 300 official matches with the club and winning nine major titles.\n\nMenzo represented the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] in one [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and one [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]].\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Paramaribo]], [[Suriname (Kingdom of the Netherlands)|Suriname]], Menzo arrived at [[Eredivisie]] giants [[AFC Ajax|Ajax Amsterdam]] at the age of 19, from amateurs A.V.V.

Newly appointed manager [[Johan Cruyff]] believed that Menzo was one of the first goalkeepers who could also make his mark as a field player.\n\nMenzo then proceeded to remain an undisputed starter for seven full seasons, helping Ajax to the [[1989\u201390 Eredivisie|1989\u201390 national title]], as well as the [[1986\u201387 European Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup]]. However, after a game in the latter competition [[1992\u201393 UEFA Cup|the following season]], a 2\u20134 loss at [[AJ Auxerre]], during which he scored an [[own goal]] and was also directly related to another, he lost his place to youth graduate [[Edwin van der Sar]], and never regained it.\n\nIn the 1994 summer, Menzo signed with [[PSV Eindhoven]], where he backed up [[Ronald Waterreus]] for two seasons. The 33-year-old managed to revive his career in [[Belgium]] with [[Lierse S.K.|Lierse SK]], which he helped win one [[Belgian Pro League|league]] and one [[Belgian Cup|cup]], eventually amassing nearly 100 official appearances. For a brief period of time, he also played in [[France]] for [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux]], arriving in August 1997 to replace [[Gilbert Bodart]]. However, having lost his place to [[Ulrich Ram\u00e9]] (who would be the club's first-choice for more than one decade), he returned to Lierse, in January 1998.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, after a second spell at Ajax, Menzo joined amateur club [[AGOVV Apeldoorn]], helping it to the [[Hoofdklasse|amateur title]]. He retired from football at the end of the season.\n\n==International career==\nMenzo gained six [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]], the first arriving in 1989. He then spent nearly three years without any further appearances, but was summoned for the squads present at both the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 1992]], as third-choice.\n\nAfter legendary [[Hans van Breukelen]] retired from international play following the latter competition, Menzo was named the starter for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualification stages]] of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]]; following two unassuming performances, the 1\u20132 loss in [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and a 2\u20132 home draw against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], he was benched, and ultimately did not even made the squad at all ([[Ed de Goey]], [[Theo Snelders]] and van der Sar would be the goalkeepers listed as starter, reserve and third respectively).\n\n==Managerial career==\nIn the summer of 2004, after former Ajax teammate [[Marco van Basten]] became head coach of the national team, Menzo was named its goalkeeping coach, remained there for two years.<ref>[http://www.elfvoetbal.nl/nieuws/52732_menzo-keeperstrainer-af-bij-oranje Menzo keeperstrainer af bij Oranje] - ELF Voetbal {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\nWhen coach [[Peter Bosz]] left in June 2005, Menzo became AGOVV's manager, remaining in the position for only one season: AGOVV became a professional club in the [[Eerste Divisie|second division]], but he did not have the qualifications to exercise in that category, subsequently moving to Amsterdam-based amateur club [[Amsterdamsche FC]].<ref>[http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/stanley-menzo-verruilt-agovv-voor-afc.htm Stanley Menzo verruilt AGOVV voor AFC] - Voetbal International {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2005, Menzo received the necessary diploma to coach professional clubs.
