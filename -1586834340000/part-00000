They were the second variety of [[British Rail]]'s standard 1972 design for suburban EMUs derived from [[British Rail Class 445|PEP]] stock, which eventually encompassed 755 vehicles and five Classes (Class [[British Rail Class 313|313]]/[[British Rail Class 314|314]]/[[British Rail Class 315|315]]/507/[[British Rail Class 508|508]]). The 507s were the first variant to be 750 V DC [[third rail]] only. They have worked on the [[Merseyrail]] network from new, and continue to do so, having been refurbished by [[Alstom]]'s [[Eastleigh Works]].The Class 507 unit is now {{age|1979|01|01}} years old, making them among the oldest units still in service on the UK mainland rail network, after the [[British Rail Class 313|Class 313]] and [[British Rail Class 508|Class 508]].\n\n==History==\nWith the [[British Rail Class 502|Class 502]] units life-expired, unable to cope with the demands of the new \"Link\" tunnel and approaching 40 years old, by 1977 a replacement was sought. Owing to the success of the [[British Rail Class 313|Class 313]] fleet on suburban services from [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]], four sets were temporarily transferred to [[Merseyside]] and based at [[Hall Road TMD]]. Sets 313013/063<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Today's Railways UK]]|issue=123|date=March 2012|issn=1750-6905}}</ref> were used for clearance trials on the [[Southport]], [[Ormskirk]] and [[Kirkby]]-[[Garston, Merseyside|Garston]] lines. The results showed that a similar type of stock would be suitable for the Merseyrail [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]].\n\nInitially, 47 sets were ordered (507001-507047) but cost issues forced this number to be reduced to 38 units, then 30 by early 1978 when the first sets were under construction. Ultimately, 33 units were built between September 1978 and October 1979.\nThe first set was delivered to [[Birkenhead North TMD|Birkenhead North depot]] during September 1978,<ref name=Maund82>{{harvnb|Maund|2001|p=82}}</ref> with the first test run taking place on 9 October 1978.<ref name=Maund82 />\n\nOn 25 October 1978, a Royal Special involving units 507001 and 507002 conveyed [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM the Queen]] and several other VIPs on a special service between [[Moorfields railway station|Moorfields]] and [[Kirkby railway station|Kirkby]]. Following the journey, she declared the new-look Merseyrail network officially open.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Merseyrail|work=Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive and British Rail|date=December 1978|oclc=8740619}}</ref> The first passenger working occurred on 1 November 1978 with 507001 working the 0739 [[Southport railway station|Southport]]-[[Liverpool Central railway station|Liverpool Central]] with a commemorative [[Headboard (train)|headboard]].<ref name=Maund82 /> It worked between [[Liverpool]] and Southport for the remainder of the day, while 507002 operated between Liverpool and Ormskirk. Further 507s steadily entered service and the 502s were in turn withdrawn. By mid 1980, Northern Line services were entirely in the hands of the 507s, and all of the sets were in service by October 1980.<ref name=Maund82 />\n\nFollowing [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatisation]], the 507s were used interchangeably between both the Northern Line and the [[Wirral Line]], working a further four routes regularly. A host of new liveries appeared following sectorisation of [[British Rail]]. The remaining 32 units were refurbished by [[Eastleigh Works|Alstom Eastleigh]] during 2002-2005. They received new interiors, CCTV, light clusters [[dot matrix display]]s and the 2+3 seating replaced with 2+2 seats.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/merseyrail-train-refurbishment.html|title=Merseyrail train refurbishment|work=[[Railway Gazette International]]|date=1 October 2002|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref> Unit 507033 was the last Merseyside set to be refurbished, entering service having been named \"Cllr George Howard\" in August 2005.<ref>\"Merseyrail 507/508 refurbishment complete\" ''[[Today's Railways UK|Entrain]]'' issue 45 September 2005 page 57</ref><ref>\"Final 507 for Merseyrail\" ''[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]]'' issue 520 17 August 2005 page 46</ref>\n\n==Incidents==\n507022 was written off as a result of a serious collision with 507004 at [[Kirkdale TMD]] on 30 September 1991.<ref>\"Steve Knight reviews the latest Merseyrail stock news\" ''[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]]'' issue 160 30 October 1991 page 9</ref> Driving motor 64388 is now in 507004, as the latter's was damaged beyond repair, and the other motor carriage, renumbered, went to [[Glasgow]]-based 314203.

Original plans were drawn up for 47; later 38 507s to be built, but costs enforced a reduction in the number. Sets are made up of two driving motor cars ('A' DMSO with the compressor; 'B' BDMSO with the battery) and a trailer. Car numbering is as follows:\n*64367-64399 - DMSO (Driving Motor Second Open)\n*71342-71374 - TSO (Trailer Second Open)\n*64405-64437 - BDMSO (Battery Driving Motor Second Open)\n\nOriginally, each 3-car set seated 234 passengers, this figure being reduced to 222 following interior modifications during the 1990s. After the introduction of high back seats during refurbishment in 2004/2005 this was reduced to 192 with space for cyclists and disabled people improved.\n\nThe 507s (and 508s) replaced [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]]-designed [[British Rail Class 502|Class 502]] EMUs on the [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]] and [[British Rail Class 503|Class 503]] EMUs on the [[Wirral Line]].\n\n==Current operations==\nFrom new, all 507s have worked the Merseyrail network.

They were the second variety of [[British Rail]]'s standard 1972 design for suburban EMUs derived from [[British Rail Class 445|PEP]] stock, which eventually encompassed 755 vehicles and five Classes (Class [[British Rail Class 313|313]]/[[British Rail Class 314|314]]/[[British Rail Class 315|315]]/507/[[British Rail Class 508|508]]). The 507s were the first variant to be 750 V DC [[third rail]] only. They have worked on the [[Merseyrail]] network from new, and continue to do so, having been refurbished by [[Alstom]]'s [[Eastleigh Works]].\n\n==History==\nWith the [[British Rail Class 502|Class 502]] units life-expired, unable to cope with the demands of the new \"Link\" tunnel and approaching 40 years old, by 1977 a replacement was sought. Owing to the success of the [[British Rail Class 313|Class 313]] fleet on suburban services from [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]], four sets were temporarily transferred to [[Merseyside]] and based at [[Hall Road TMD]]. Sets 313013/063<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Today's Railways UK]]|issue=123|date=March 2012|issn=1750-6905}}</ref> were used for clearance trials on the [[Southport]], [[Ormskirk]] and [[Kirkby]]-[[Garston, Merseyside|Garston]] lines. The results showed that a similar type of stock would be suitable for the Merseyrail [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]].\n\nInitially, 47 sets were ordered (507001-507047) but cost issues forced this number to be reduced to 38 units, then 30 by early 1978 when the first sets were under construction. Ultimately, 33 units were built between September 1978 and October 1979.\nThe first set was delivered to [[Birkenhead North TMD|Birkenhead North depot]] during September 1978,<ref name=Maund82>{{harvnb|Maund|2001|p=82}}</ref> with the first test run taking place on 9 October 1978.<ref name=Maund82 />\n\nOn 25 October 1978, a Royal Special involving units 507001 and 507002 conveyed [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM the Queen]] and several other VIPs on a special service between [[Moorfields railway station|Moorfields]] and [[Kirkby railway station|Kirkby]]. Following the journey, she declared the new-look Merseyrail network officially open.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Merseyrail|work=Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive and British Rail|date=December 1978|oclc=8740619}}</ref> The first passenger working occurred on 1 November 1978 with 507001 working the 0739 [[Southport railway station|Southport]]-[[Liverpool Central railway station|Liverpool Central]] with a commemorative [[Headboard (train)|headboard]].<ref name=Maund82 /> It worked between [[Liverpool]] and Southport for the remainder of the day, while 507002 operated between Liverpool and Ormskirk. Further 507s steadily entered service and the 502s were in turn withdrawn. By mid 1980, Northern Line services were entirely in the hands of the 507s, and all of the sets were in service by October 1980.<ref name=Maund82 />\n\nFollowing [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatisation]], the 507s were used interchangeably between both the Northern Line and the [[Wirral Line]], working a further four routes regularly. A host of new liveries appeared following sectorisation of [[British Rail]]. The remaining 32 units were refurbished by [[Eastleigh Works|Alstom Eastleigh]] during 2002-2005. They received new interiors, CCTV, light clusters [[dot matrix display]]s and the 2+3 seating replaced with 2+2 seats.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/merseyrail-train-refurbishment.html|title=Merseyrail train refurbishment|work=[[Railway Gazette International]]|date=1 October 2002|accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref> Unit 507033 was the last Merseyside set to be refurbished, entering service having been named \"Cllr George Howard\" in August 2005.<ref>\"Merseyrail 507/508 refurbishment complete\" ''[[Today's Railways UK|Entrain]]'' issue 45 September 2005 page 57</ref><ref>\"Final 507 for Merseyrail\" ''[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]]'' issue 520 17 August 2005 page 46</ref>\n\n==Incidents==\n507022 was written off as a result of a serious collision with 507004 at [[Kirkdale TMD]] on 30 September 1991.<ref>\"Steve Knight reviews the latest Merseyrail stock news\" ''[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]]'' issue 160 30 October 1991 page 9</ref> Driving motor 64388 is now in 507004, as the latter's was damaged beyond repair, and the other motor carriage, renumbered, went to [[Glasgow]]-based 314203.

Original plans were drawn up for 47; later 38 507s to be built, but costs enforced a reduction in the number. Sets are made up of two driving motor cars ('A' DMSO with the compressor; 'B' BDMSO with the battery) and a trailer. Car numbering is as follows:\n*64367-64399 - DMSO (Driving Motor Second Open)\n*71342-71374 - TSO (Trailer Second Open)\n*64405-64437 - BDMSO (Battery Driving Motor Second Open)\n\nOriginally, each 3-car set seated 234 passengers, this figure being reduced to 222 following interior modifications during the 1990s. After the introduction of high back seats during refurbishment in 2004/2005 this was reduced to 192 with space for cyclists and disabled people improved.\n\nThe 507s (and 508s) replaced [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]]-designed [[British Rail Class 502|Class 502]] EMUs on the [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]] and [[British Rail Class 503|Class 503]] EMUs on the [[Wirral Line]].\n\n==Current operations==\nFrom new, all 507s have worked the Merseyrail network.

The passenger doors were all yellow, introduced as a safety measure by Merseyrail. 'M' branding on the front ends and on the sides, and a Merseyrail vinyl. The vinyl was purchased without graffiti protection, and so it does not wear well if vandalised. Several sets ran with their 'M' logos missing or worn away.\n*'''Merseyrail Capital of Culture''' (2008\u20132009): based around the ''Merseyrail Refurbished'' livery, with overlain graphics.

At first she was thought, on the basis of shadows on her chest x-rays, to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]], which had killed her father. She received compensation from her employer's insurance company and took her physicians' advice to lead as much of an open-air life as she could.

At fourteen, he had quarrelled with his father, run away from home, and worked in the United States as a cowboy and gold prospector.

At a Warsaw caf\u00e9, she was hailed by a woman acquaintance: \"Krystyna! Krystyna Skarbek! What are you doing here? We heard that you'd gone abroad!\" When Skarbek denied that her name was Krystyna Skarbek, the lady answered that she would have ''sworn'' she was Krystyna Skarbek; the resemblance was positively uncanny!

Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now [[exfil]]trating Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].\nSkarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish [[anti-tank rifle, model 35]], with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her [[Budapest]] apartment.

In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the [[Gestapo]]. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by biting her tongue until it bled and the Germans released them. However, the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided it was time they fled Hungary, a German ally.<ref>Mulley, pp. 96-99</ref>  \n\n===Car journey===\nBritish Ambassador in Hungary, [[Owen O'Malley]], undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. He issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\" and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\" a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into [[Yugoslavia]] in the trunk of O'Malley's [[Chrysler]].  Kowerski aka Kennedy drove his [[Opel]] across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them a few days later in [[Belgrade]] where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.  In late-February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis.\" \" Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attache [[Aidan Crawley]]. The couple gave Crawley rolls of [[microfilm]] given them by a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"[[:pl:Muszkieterzy (organizacja)|Musketeers]]. The microfilm contained pictures of the German military buildup near the Soviet Union's border The microfilm signaled to the British that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in London who could hardly believe it, but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kennedy's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.<ref>Mulley, pp. 99-107</ref>    \n\nLeaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continue on to [[Turkey]] and [[Istanbul]]. In Istanbul, the couple met with exiled poles and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional.  Skarbek's husband, the very intimidating Jerzy Gizyeki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when the husband met Kowerski, and they persuaded him to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek's previous job as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance in Budapest. Kowerski and Skarbek then continued their journey in the Opel through Syria and Lebanon which were under the control of [[Vichy France]]. Skarbek persuaded the Vichy Embassy officials to give them visas. They then entered [[Palestine]], under British control, and proceeded onward to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] arriving in May 1941.<ref>Mulley, 108-118</ref>            \n\nSkarbek and Kowerski \"had driven fairly blithely across hundreds of miles of Nazi-sympathizing territory, often carrying incriminating letters and sometimes microfilm and just weeks or at times days ahead of the Nazi advance.\"<ref>Mulley, p.118</ref>\n\n===Cairo===\n[[File:ColinGubbins.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen.

These were addressed in London by General [[Colin Gubbins]]\u2014to be, from September 1943, head of SOE\u2014in a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]:{{blockquote|Last year [\u2026] a Polish citizen named Kowerski was working with our officials in [[Budapest]] on Polish affairs.

I understand from Major [[Peter Wilkinson (SOE)|Wilkinson]] [of SOE] that General [[Stanis\u0142aw Kopa\u0144ski|Kopa\u0144ski]] [Kowerski's former commander in Poland] is doubtful about Kowerski's loyalty to the Polish cause [because] Kowerski has not reported to General Kopa\u0144ski for duty with the [[Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade|Brigade]]. Major Wilkinson informs me that Kowerski had had instructions from our officials not to report to General Kopa\u0144ski, as he was engaged [\u2026] on work of a secret nature which necessitated his remaining apart.  It seems therefore that Kowerski's loyalty has only been called into question because of these instructions.<ref>Quoted in M.

Similarly, when Skarbek visited Polish military headquarters in her British [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] uniform, she was treated by the Polish military chiefs with the highest respect.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol.

Masson, ''Christine'', p. 127.</ref> The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in [[Berlin]] on 1 August 1946. Skarbek was sidelined from mainstream action. [[Vera Atkins]], assistant to the head of F Section, [[Maurice Buckmaster]], later described Skarbek being \"very brave, very attractive, but a loner and a law unto herself\".<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved'', pp. 259\u201360.</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] Department in August 1944. Skarbek is second from right.]]  \nSkarbek's situation changed greatly in 1944, with a turn of events that led to some of her most famous exploits. Fluent in French, she was offered to SOE's teams in France, under the ''nom de guerre'' \"Madame Pauline\". The offer was timely: SOE was running short of trained operatives to cover the increased demands being placed on it in the run-up to the invasion of France. New operatives were already in training, but the work took time. If inserted into occupied Europe before they had absorbed the numerous physical and intellectual skills required for survival, the operatives could compromise not only themselves but their SOE colleagues already in place and French Resistance members. Skarbek had a track record of successful courier work in occupied Europe and would need only a little \"refresher\" work and some guidance about working in France. There was one particular need that required urgent attention: the replacement of a lost [[courier]] on a busy circuit that would be among the first to meet the proposed Allied landings. Skarbek was selected to replace SOE agent [[Cecily Lefort]], who had been captured, tortured and executed by the Gestapo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe SOE had several branches working in France. Though most of the women in France answered to [[F Section]] in London, Skarbek's mission was launched from [[Algiers]], the base of AMF Section. This factor, combined with Skarbek's absence from the usual SOE training programme, sometimes intrigues researchers. AMF Section was only set up in the wake of [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: (1) it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from [[North African Campaign|Allied North Africa]] than from London, across [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]]; (2) since the [[South of France]] would be liberated by separate Allied landings there ([[Operation Dragoon]]), SOE units in the area needed to be transferred to have links with those headquarters, not with forces for [[Normandy]]; (3) AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French in North Africa, who did not generally support [[Charles de Gaulle]] and who had been linked with opposition in the former \"[[Vichy France|Unoccupied Zone]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAfter the two invasions, the distinctions became irrelevant, and almost all the SOE Sections in France were united with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] into the ''[[French Forces of the Interior|Forces Francaises de l'Interieur]]'' (''FFI'').  (There was one exception: The [[EU/P Section]], which was formed by Poles in France and remained part of the trans-European Polish Resistance movement, under Polish command.) Skarbek, as \"Pauline Armand\", parachuted into southeastern France on 6 July 1944 and became part of the \"Jockey\" network directed by a Belgian-British lapsed pacifist, [[Francis Cammaerts]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} She assisted Cammaerts by linking [[Italian Resistance|Italian partisans]] and French Maquis for joint operations against the Germans in the [[Alps]] and by inducing non-Germans, especially conscripted Poles, in the German occupation forces to defect to the Allies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn early August 1944, she made contact with Polish conscripts in the German garrison at [[Col de Larche]], a high-altitude pass.  After a two-day hike through the mountains she persuaded the Polish conscripts to desert and then managed to convince the resident German troops to surrender.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 13 August 1944, at [[Digne]], two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, [[Xan Fielding]]\u2014another SOE agent, who had previously operated in [[Crete]]\u2014and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek, learning that they were to be executed, managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who acted as liaison officer between the local French [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as a niece of British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal \u2013 an offer of two million francs for the men's release. Schenck then introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 205.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|For three hours Christine argued and bargained with him and, having turned the full force of her magnetic personality on him... told him that the Allies would be arriving at any moment and that she, a British parachutist, was in constant wireless contact with the British forces.  To make her point, she produced some broken... useless W/T crystals.... 'If I were you,' said Christine, 'I should give careful thought to the proposition I have made you. As I told ''Capitaine'' Schenck, if anything should happen to my husband [as she falsely described Cammaerts] or to his friends, the reprisals would be swift and terrible, for I don't have to tell you that both you and the ''Capitaine'' have an infamous reputation among the locals.' Increasingly alarmed by the thought of what might befall him when the Allies and the Resistance decided to avenge the many murders he had committed, Waem struck the butt end of his revolver on the table and said, 'If I do get them out of prison, what will you do to protect me?'<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>}}\n\nAfter Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value.<ref>[[Francis Cammaerts]], who after the war kept in touch with Max Waem, in Belgium, gave his account to the sound archives of the [[Imperial War Museum]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe story of Skarbeks's bribe is fictionalized in the last episode of the television series, ''[[Wish Me Luck]].''\n\n===D\u00e9nouement===\n[[File:Krystyna Skarbek.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Krystyna Skarbek]]\nSkarbek's service in France restored her political reputation and greatly enhanced her military reputation. When the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle), some of the British women sought new missions in the [[Pacific War]], since the [[Empire of Japan]] still held on; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland in the final missions of SOE. \n\nAs the [[Red Army]] advanced across Poland, the British government and [[Polish government-in-exile]] worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945. In the event, the mission, called [[Operation Freston]], was cancelled because the first party to enter Poland were captured by the Red Army (they were released in February 1945).<ref>[http://www.polandinexile.com/exile11.htm Guideline of events surrounding Operation Freston], polandinexile.com; accessed 1 July 2014.</ref>\n\nThe women of SOE were all given military rank, with honorary commissions in either the Women's Transport Service, the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), officially part of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF). Skarbek appears to have been a member of both. In preparation for her service in France, she appears to have been with FANY. On her return, she seems to have transferred to the WAAF as an officer until the end of the war in Europe: 21 November 1944 to 14 May 1945. \n\nShe was one of the few SOE female field agents promoted beyond [[subaltern]] rank to [[Captain (land)|captain]], or the Air Force equivalent: [[flight officer]], the WAAF counterpart of the [[flight lieutenant]] rank for male officers. Skarbek, like [[Pearl Witherington]], the courier who had taken command of a group when the designated commander was captured, and [[Yvonne Cormeau]], the most successful [[wireless]] operator,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} ended the war as honorary flight officers.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nSkarbek's exploits were recognised with award of the [[George Medal]].<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville, Britain's First Special Agent of World War II'', London, Macmillan, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4472-2565-2}}, p. 297.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/resistance/sources/docs/2/transcript.htm |title=Extract from a citation for Christine Granville |work=The National Archives |year=2015 |accessdate=22 November 2015}} recommendation for [[George Cross]]</ref> Several years after the Digne incident, in London, she told another Pole and fellow [[World War II]] veteran that, during her negotiations with the Gestapo, she had been unaware of any danger to herself.

Krystyna, their second child, took after her father and his liking for riding horses, which she sat astride rather than [[side-saddle]] as was usual for women. She also became an expert skier during visits to [[Zakopane]] in the [[Tatra mountains]] of southern Poland. From the start, there was a complete rapport between father and daughter, who needed little encouragement to become a [[tomboy]].<ref>M.

The Goldfeder financial empire had almost completely collapsed, and there was barely enough money to support the widowed Countess Stefania. Krystyna, not wishing to be a burden to her mother, worked at a [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] car dealership, but soon became ill from automobile fumes and had to give up the job. At first she was thought, on the basis of shadows on her chest x-rays, to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]], which had killed her father. She received compensation from her employer's insurance company and took her physicians' advice to lead as much of an open-air life as she could. She began spending a great deal of time hiking and skiing the Tatra Mountains.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nOn 21 April 1930, Krystyna married a young businessman, Gustaw Gettlich at the Spiritual Seminary Church in Warsaw. They proved incompatible, and the marriage soon ended without rancour.

Her rescuer was Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, a brilliant, moody, irascible eccentric, who came from a wealthy family in [[Kamieniec Podolski]] (formerly Poland, at the time Soviet Union). At fourteen, he had quarrelled with his father, run away from home, and worked in the United States as a cowboy and gold prospector. He eventually became an author and travelled the world in search of material for his books and articles. He knew Africa well and hoped one day to return there.<ref name=\"Christine p. 24\">M.

The British authorities showed little interest but were eventually convinced by Skarbek's acquaintances, including journalist [[Frederick Augustus Voigt]], who introduced her to the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS). The first SIS mention of her was in December 1939.

At a Warsaw caf\u00e9, she was hailed by a woman acquaintance: \"Krystyna! Krystyna Skarbek! What are you doing here? We heard that you'd gone abroad!\" When Skarbek denied that her name was Krystyna Skarbek, the lady answered that she would have ''sworn'' she was Krystyna Skarbek; the resemblance was positively uncanny! After the woman left, Skarbek, to minimise suspicion, tarried a while before leaving the caf\u00e9.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 950.</ref>\n\nIn Hungary, Skarbek met a Polish army officer, [[Andrzej Kowerski]] (1912\u20131988), who later used the British ''nom de guerre'' \"Andrew Kennedy\". Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now [[exfil]]trating Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].\nSkarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish [[anti-tank rifle, model 35]], with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her [[Budapest]] apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and there was no time for [[reverse engineering]]. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |title=WW II German Infantry Anti-Tank Weapons |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135457/http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt the request of MI6, she and Kowerski organised surveillance of all the rail, road and river traffic on the borders with Romania and Germany.

In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the [[Gestapo]]. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by biting her tongue until it bled and the Germans released them. However, the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided it was time they fled Hungary, a German ally.<ref>Mulley, pp. 96-99</ref>  \n\n===Car journey===\nBritish Ambassador in Hungary, [[Owen O'Malley]], undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. He issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\" and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\" a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into [[Yugoslavia]] in the trunk of O'Malley's [[Chrysler]].  Kowerski aka Kennedy drove his [[Opel]] across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them a few days later in [[Belgrade]] where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.  In late-February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis.\" \" Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attache [[Aidan Crawley]]. The couple gave Crawley rolls of [[microfilm]] given them by a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"[[:pl:Muszkieterzy (organizacja)|Musketeers]]. The microfilm contained pictures of the German military buildup near the Soviet Union's border The microfilm signaled to the British that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in London who could hardly believe it, but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kennedy's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.<ref>Mulley, pp. 99-107</ref>    \n\nLeaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continue on to [[Turkey]] and [[Istanbul]]. In Istanbul, the couple met with exiled poles and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional.  Skarbek's husband, the very intimidating Jerzy Gizyeki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when the husband met Kowerski, and they persuaded him to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek's previous job as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance in Budapest. Kowerski and Skarbek then continued their journey in the Opel through Syria and Lebanon which were under the control of [[Vichy France]]. Skarbek persuaded the Vichy Embassy officials to give them visas. They then entered [[Palestine]], under British control, and proceeded onward to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] arriving in May 1941.<ref>Mulley, 108-118</ref>            \n\nSkarbek and Kowerski \"had driven fairly blithely across hundreds of miles of Nazi-sympathizing territory, often carrying incriminating letters and sometimes microfilm and just weeks or at times days ahead of the Nazi advance.\"<ref>Mulley, p.118</ref>\n\n===Cairo===\n[[File:ColinGubbins.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen.

Only German spies, some Polish intelligence officers believed, could have obtained the visas.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 116.</ref>\n\nThere were also specific suspicions about Kowerski. These were addressed in London by General [[Colin Gubbins]]\u2014to be, from September 1943, head of SOE\u2014in a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]:{{blockquote|Last year [\u2026] a Polish citizen named Kowerski was working with our officials in [[Budapest]] on Polish affairs. He is now in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] [\u2026]. I understand from Major [[Peter Wilkinson (SOE)|Wilkinson]] [of SOE] that General [[Stanis\u0142aw Kopa\u0144ski|Kopa\u0144ski]] [Kowerski's former commander in Poland] is doubtful about Kowerski's loyalty to the Polish cause [because] Kowerski has not reported to General Kopa\u0144ski for duty with the [[Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade|Brigade]]. Major Wilkinson informs me that Kowerski had had instructions from our officials not to report to General Kopa\u0144ski, as he was engaged [\u2026] on work of a secret nature which necessitated his remaining apart.  It seems therefore that Kowerski's loyalty has only been called into question because of these instructions.<ref>Quoted in M. Binney, ''The Women Who Lived for Danger'', pp. 71\u201372.</ref>|}}\n\nKowerski eventually cleared up any misunderstandings with General Kopa\u0144ski and was able to resume intelligence work. Similarly, when Skarbek visited Polish military headquarters in her British [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] uniform, she was treated by the Polish military chiefs with the highest respect.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 949.</ref>\n\nIt could not but have helped that, in the meantime, Germany had started [[Operation Barbarossa]], an invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] (22 June 1941), as her intelligence obtained from the Musketeers had predicted.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 131.</ref> It is now known that advance information about Operation Barbarossa had also been provided by a number of other sources, including [[Ultra]].<ref>Read, Anthony, and David Fisher, ''[[Lucy spy ring|Operation Lucy]]: Most Secret Spy Ring of the Second World War'', New York, Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1981; {{ISBN|0-698-11079-X}}.</ref>\n\nWhen Skarbek's husband, Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, was informed that Skarbek and Kowerski's services were being dispensed with, he took umbrage and abruptly bowed out of his own career as a British intelligence agent. When Skarbek told her husband that she loved Kowerski, Gi\u017cycki left for London, eventually emigrating to Canada.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 127.</ref> The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in [[Berlin]] on 1 August 1946. Skarbek was sidelined from mainstream action. [[Vera Atkins]], assistant to the head of F Section, [[Maurice Buckmaster]], later described Skarbek being \"very brave, very attractive, but a loner and a law unto herself\".<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved'', pp. 259\u201360.</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] Department in August 1944. Skarbek is second from right.]]  \nSkarbek's situation changed greatly in 1944, with a turn of events that led to some of her most famous exploits. Fluent in French, she was offered to SOE's teams in France, under the ''nom de guerre'' \"Madame Pauline\". The offer was timely: SOE was running short of trained operatives to cover the increased demands being placed on it in the run-up to the invasion of France. New operatives were already in training, but the work took time. If inserted into occupied Europe before they had absorbed the numerous physical and intellectual skills required for survival, the operatives could compromise not only themselves but their SOE colleagues already in place and French Resistance members. Skarbek had a track record of successful courier work in occupied Europe and would need only a little \"refresher\" work and some guidance about working in France. There was one particular need that required urgent attention: the replacement of a lost [[courier]] on a busy circuit that would be among the first to meet the proposed Allied landings. Skarbek was selected to replace SOE agent [[Cecily Lefort]], who had been captured, tortured and executed by the Gestapo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe SOE had several branches working in France. Though most of the women in France answered to [[F Section]] in London, Skarbek's mission was launched from [[Algiers]], the base of AMF Section. This factor, combined with Skarbek's absence from the usual SOE training programme, sometimes intrigues researchers. AMF Section was only set up in the wake of [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: (1) it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from [[North African Campaign|Allied North Africa]] than from London, across [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]]; (2) since the [[South of France]] would be liberated by separate Allied landings there ([[Operation Dragoon]]), SOE units in the area needed to be transferred to have links with those headquarters, not with forces for [[Normandy]]; (3) AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French in North Africa, who did not generally support [[Charles de Gaulle]] and who had been linked with opposition in the former \"[[Vichy France|Unoccupied Zone]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAfter the two invasions, the distinctions became irrelevant, and almost all the SOE Sections in France were united with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] into the ''[[French Forces of the Interior|Forces Francaises de l'Interieur]]'' (''FFI'').  (There was one exception: The [[EU/P Section]], which was formed by Poles in France and remained part of the trans-European Polish Resistance movement, under Polish command.) Skarbek, as \"Pauline Armand\", parachuted into southeastern France on 6 July 1944 and became part of the \"Jockey\" network directed by a Belgian-British lapsed pacifist, [[Francis Cammaerts]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} She assisted Cammaerts by linking [[Italian Resistance|Italian partisans]] and French Maquis for joint operations against the Germans in the [[Alps]] and by inducing non-Germans, especially conscripted Poles, in the German occupation forces to defect to the Allies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn early August 1944, she made contact with Polish conscripts in the German garrison at [[Col de Larche]], a high-altitude pass.  After a two-day hike through the mountains she persuaded the Polish conscripts to desert and then managed to convince the resident German troops to surrender.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 13 August 1944, at [[Digne]], two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, [[Xan Fielding]]\u2014another SOE agent, who had previously operated in [[Crete]]\u2014and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek, learning that they were to be executed, managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who acted as liaison officer between the local French [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as a niece of British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal \u2013 an offer of two million francs for the men's release. Schenck then introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 205.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|For three hours Christine argued and bargained with him and, having turned the full force of her magnetic personality on him... told him that the Allies would be arriving at any moment and that she, a British parachutist, was in constant wireless contact with the British forces.  To make her point, she produced some broken... useless W/T crystals.... 'If I were you,' said Christine, 'I should give careful thought to the proposition I have made you. As I told ''Capitaine'' Schenck, if anything should happen to my husband [as she falsely described Cammaerts] or to his friends, the reprisals would be swift and terrible, for I don't have to tell you that both you and the ''Capitaine'' have an infamous reputation among the locals.' Increasingly alarmed by the thought of what might befall him when the Allies and the Resistance decided to avenge the many murders he had committed, Waem struck the butt end of his revolver on the table and said, 'If I do get them out of prison, what will you do to protect me?'<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>}}\n\nAfter Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value.<ref>[[Francis Cammaerts]], who after the war kept in touch with Max Waem, in Belgium, gave his account to the sound archives of the [[Imperial War Museum]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe story of Skarbeks's bribe is fictionalized in the last episode of the television series, ''[[Wish Me Luck]].''\n\n===D\u00e9nouement===\n[[File:Krystyna Skarbek.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Krystyna Skarbek]]\nSkarbek's service in France restored her political reputation and greatly enhanced her military reputation. When the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle), some of the British women sought new missions in the [[Pacific War]], since the [[Empire of Japan]] still held on; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland in the final missions of SOE. \n\nAs the [[Red Army]] advanced across Poland, the British government and [[Polish government-in-exile]] worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945. In the event, the mission, called [[Operation Freston]], was cancelled because the first party to enter Poland were captured by the Red Army (they were released in February 1945).<ref>[http://www.polandinexile.com/exile11.htm Guideline of events surrounding Operation Freston], polandinexile.com; accessed 1 July 2014.</ref>\n\nThe women of SOE were all given military rank, with honorary commissions in either the Women's Transport Service, the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), officially part of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF). Skarbek appears to have been a member of both. In preparation for her service in France, she appears to have been with FANY. On her return, she seems to have transferred to the WAAF as an officer until the end of the war in Europe: 21 November 1944 to 14 May 1945. \n\nShe was one of the few SOE female field agents promoted beyond [[subaltern]] rank to [[Captain (land)|captain]], or the Air Force equivalent: [[flight officer]], the WAAF counterpart of the [[flight lieutenant]] rank for male officers. Skarbek, like [[Pearl Witherington]], the courier who had taken command of a group when the designated commander was captured, and [[Yvonne Cormeau]], the most successful [[wireless]] operator,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} ended the war as honorary flight officers.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nSkarbek's exploits were recognised with award of the [[George Medal]].<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville, Britain's First Special Agent of World War II'', London, Macmillan, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4472-2565-2}}, p. 297.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/resistance/sources/docs/2/transcript.htm |title=Extract from a citation for Christine Granville |work=The National Archives |year=2015 |accessdate=22 November 2015}} recommendation for [[George Cross]]</ref> Several years after the Digne incident, in London, she told another Pole and fellow [[World War II]] veteran that, during her negotiations with the Gestapo, she had been unaware of any danger to herself.

Gill added that in a letter to Sagar, he had written about the Ramayana as a subject for the television series was ideal in that it was \"a repository of moral and social values\" and that its message was \"secular and universal\". He added that he had noted in the letter that Sagar's \"real challenge would lie in seeing the epic \"with the eyes of a modern man and relating its message to the spiritual and emotional needs of our age\". Gill added that he also wrote a similar letter to [[B. R. Chopra]] over the production of the series ''[[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|Mahabharat]]'' based on [[Mahabharata|another epic of the same name]], and mentioned that both he and Sagar accepted to his suggestions and constituted panels of experts and scholars to conceptualize the production.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gill|first1=S.

K. Bose, the media director of Hindustan Thompson Associates, remarked, \"The unique thing about the Ramayana was its consistency. Other programmes like ''[[Buniyaad]]'' and even ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n===Impact===\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \"the tape\" if he had \"made Ramayana or [[Ramlila|Ram-Leela]]\".<ref name=\"ht1\"/> Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and [[Arun Govil]] (who played Rama) \"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\", and that [[Deepika Chikhalia]] (Sita) and [[Arvind Trivedi]] (Ravana) went on to become [[Member of Parliament (India)|members of parliament]].<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nOn public demand, the series is re-telecast from 28 March 2020 with one show in morning (9:00am to 10:30am IST) and one show in night (9:00pm to 10:30pm IST) during the [[2020 coronavirus lockdown in India|lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus]] on [[DD National]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-prasar-bharati-to-re-telecast-ramayan-from-march-28-on-public-demand-during-lockdown/349524|title=Prasar Bharati To Re-Telecast 'Ramayan' From March 28 On 'Public Demand' During Lockdown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv/good-news-iconic-show-ramayana-to-re-telecast-starting-tomorrow/articleshow/74840124.cms|title=Good News!

K. Bose, the media director of Hindustan Thompson Associates, remarked, \"The unique thing about the Ramayana was its consistency. Other programmes like ''[[Buniyaad]]'' and even ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n===Impact===\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically.
