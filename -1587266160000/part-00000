The book follows Kit Gordy, who is sent to a [[boarding school]] where only four students are admitted including herself. The students suddenly develop new talents, with Kit waking up one night playing a musical piece she has never heard. After they are told that they have been channeling the spirits of talented historical figures, Kit tries to escape the school before the bond between the spirits and the students becomes permanent.\n\nDuncan began working on the novel based on the suggestion of an editor who had never seen a gothic novel written for young adults. One version of the novel that she submitted to the publisher was returned to her for revision because all the victims in the story were female whereas all the spirits they were channeling were male. The publisher was worried that feminists would not like this idea, so after Duncan made one of the spirits a woman the book was accepted for publication.\n\nA revised edition of the novel was released in 2011 with updates to modernize the novel. Critical reception to the book was mostly positive, with staff at the [[University of Iowa]] adding the novel to their Books for Young Adults list. A [[Down a Dark Hall (film)|film adaptation of the book]] starring [[AnnaSophia Robb]] and [[Uma Thurman]] was released in 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nKit Gordy is forced to go to a boarding school in [[Upstate New York]] named the Blackwood School for Girls. She arrives at her home for the school year with her new stepfather and her mother, who is ready to go on their honeymoon. Madame Duret is in charge of the school, having previously run schools in France and England before moving to the United States to open Blackwood.\n\nThe girls at the school begin to discover new talents, which manifest most prominently as they sleep. Lynda, who exhibited no artistic ability before attending the school, begins to paint landscapes on a professional level, signing them \"T.C.\" Ruth finds herself able to practice high-level math and science. Sandy, Kit's closest friend at Blackwood, writes [[sonnets]] she says were dictated to her by a woman named Ellis. One night, Kit wakes up at the school's piano playing a piece she has never heard as Jules, Madame Duret's son and Blackwood's music teacher, records her. Kit demands to know what is happening at the school and why the students suddenly possess these new skills. A conference with all the students and teachers is quickly arranged so that Kit and the other students can hear the answers to these questions.\n\nMadame Duret explains that she is using the girls to channel the spirits of talented individuals from the past so that they can carry out the work they could not finish before their death. She confirms Ruth's suspicion that [[Emily Bront\u00eb]] under her pen name Ellis Bell has been contacting Sandy. Kit also realizes that Lynda must be channeling [[Thomas Cole]], whose painting she saw in Madame Duret's office. Several days later, the girls discover that many of their letters to their friends and family have been withheld from them. Kit and Sandy also determine that if they do not leave Blackwood before Christmas vacation, the psychic bonds will become permanent and they will never be free from the harassment of the dead. In an effort to escape the school, Kit slips a letter to Blackwood's former cook and tells her to get it to Tracy Rosenblum, Kit's best friend.\n\nThe lights go out during a thunderstorm one night, so Kit sneaks off to Madame Duret's office to call for help. However, the phone line is dead and Jules quickly finds her in the office after Madame Duret sends him out to search for her. Kit convinces him to access Madam Duret's files so they can see what happened to her previous students. Jules looks through the files and discovers that out of the twenty girls at her previous schools, four died and the rest were sent to mental institutions. He finally agrees to help the girls escape. Jules and Kit confront Madame Duret with their findings as Sandy and Ruth look on. Sandy and Ruth throw work they completed into the lit fireplace, angering the spirits and causing the fire to quickly spread across the house. Once they make it safely outside, they realize that they left Lynda in her bedroom. Kit goes back to save her, while Ruth and Sandy throw rocks at her window to get Lynda's attention. Kit convinces Lynda to jump to safety from outside her locked door, but soon realizes that she is trapped in the burning house. An apparition of Kit's father, who died in a car accident when she was little, leads her out of the house. Tracy's family is waiting outside to take her home, having received a phone call from the ex chef that she was being held against her will.\n\n==Background and publication history==\n''Down a Dark Hall'' was originally published on September 26, 1974 by [[Little, Brown and Company]] in hardcover.<ref name=\"kirkus\">{{cite web |title=Down a Dark Hall |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lois-duncan-8/down-a-dark-hall/ |website=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |accessdate=March 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328212915/https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lois-duncan-8/down-a-dark-hall/ |archive-date=March 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=John |title=Down a Dark Hall |journal=Best Sellers |date=April 1, 1974 |volume=34 |issue=1 |page=430 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112002883657;view=1up;seq=430 |accessdate=May 20, 2019}}</ref> Duncan began writing the book after an editor, who had never seen a [[gothic fiction|gothic novel]] aimed at young adults, suggested she try coming up with one.<ref name=\"wdb\">{{cite book |last1=Duncan |first1=Lois |title=How to Write and Sell Your Personal Experiences |date=1979 |publisher=Writer's Digest Books |isbn=0-911654-74-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/howtowritesellyo00dunc/page/190 190\u2013192] |url=https://archive.org/details/howtowritesellyo00dunc/page/190 }}</ref> ''Down a Dark Hall'' is the only gothic novel that Duncan ever wrote.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Duncan |first1=Lois |title=Teacher Guides |url=https://loisduncan.arquettes.com/teacher's%20guide4.htm |website=loisduncan.arquettes.com |accessdate=May 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509221742/http://loisduncan.arquettes.com/teacher's%20guide4.htm |archive-date=May 9, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> A challenge that she had while writing the book was creating new descriptions for Blackwood's upstairs hallway each time Kit used it to walk to and from her room.

After they are told that they have been channeling the spirits of talented historical figures, Kit tries to escape the school before the bond between the spirits and the students becomes permanent.\n\nDuncan began working on the novel based on the suggestion of an editor who had never seen a gothic novel written for young adults. One version of the novel that she submitted to the publisher was returned to her for revision because all the victims in the story were female whereas all the spirits they were channeling were male. The publisher was worried that feminists would not like this idea, so after Duncan made one of the spirits a woman the book was accepted for publication.\n\nA revised edition of the novel was released in 2011 with updates to modernize the novel. Critical reception to the book was mostly positive, with staff at the [[University of Iowa]] adding the novel to their Books for Young Adults list. A [[Down a Dark Hall (film)|film adaptation of the book]] starring [[AnnaSophia Robb]] and [[Uma Thurman]] was released in 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nKit Gordy is forced to go to a boarding school in [[Upstate New York]] named the Blackwood School for Girls. She arrives at her home for the school year with her new stepfather and her mother, who is ready to go on their honeymoon. Madame Duret is in charge of the school, having previously run schools in France and England before moving to the United States to open Blackwood.\n\nThe girls at the school begin to discover new talents, which manifest most prominently as they sleep. Lynda, who exhibited no artistic ability before attending the school, begins to paint landscapes on a professional level, signing them \"T.C.\" Ruth finds herself able to practice high-level math and science. Sandy, Kit's closest friend at Blackwood, writes [[sonnets]] she says were dictated to her by a woman named Ellis. One night, Kit wakes up at the school's piano playing a piece she has never heard as Jules, Madame Duret's son and Blackwood's music teacher, records her. Kit demands to know what is happening at the school and why the students suddenly possess these new skills. A conference with all the students and teachers is quickly arranged so that Kit and the other students can hear the answers to these questions.\n\nMadame Duret explains that she is using the girls to channel the spirits of talented individuals from the past so that they can carry out the work they could not finish before their death. She confirms Ruth's suspicion that [[Emily Bront\u00eb]] under her pen name Ellis Bell has been contacting Sandy. Kit also realizes that Lynda must be channeling [[Thomas Cole]], whose painting she saw in Madame Duret's office. Several days later, the girls discover that many of their letters to their friends and family have been withheld from them. Kit and Sandy also determine that if they do not leave Blackwood before Christmas vacation, the psychic bonds will become permanent and they will never be free from the harassment of the dead. In an effort to escape the school, Kit slips a letter to Blackwood's former cook and tells her to get it to Tracy Rosenblum, Kit's best friend.\n\nThe lights go out during a thunderstorm one night, so Kit sneaks off to Madame Duret's office to call for help. However, the phone line is dead and Jules quickly finds her in the office after Madame Duret sends him out to search for her. Kit convinces him to access Madam Duret's files so they can see what happened to her previous students. Jules looks through the files and discovers that out of the twenty girls at her previous schools, four died and the rest were sent to mental institutions. He finally agrees to help the girls escape. Jules and Kit confront Madame Duret with their findings as Sandy and Ruth look on. Sandy and Ruth throw work they completed into the lit fireplace, angering the spirits and causing the fire to quickly spread across the house. Once they make it safely outside, they realize that they left Lynda in her bedroom. Kit goes back to save her, while Ruth and Sandy throw rocks at her window to get Lynda's attention. Kit convinces Lynda to jump to safety from outside her locked door, but soon realizes that she is trapped in the burning house. An apparition of Kit's father, who died in a car accident when she was little, leads her out of the house. Tracy's family is waiting outside to take her home, having received a phone call from the ex chef that she was being held against her will.\n\n==Background and publication history==\n''Down a Dark Hall'' was originally published on September 26, 1974 by [[Little, Brown and Company]] in hardcover.<ref name=\"kirkus\">{{cite web |title=Down a Dark Hall |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lois-duncan-8/down-a-dark-hall/ |website=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |accessdate=March 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328212915/https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/lois-duncan-8/down-a-dark-hall/ |archive-date=March 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=John |title=Down a Dark Hall |journal=Best Sellers |date=April 1, 1974 |volume=34 |issue=1 |page=430 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112002883657;view=1up;seq=430 |accessdate=May 20, 2019}}</ref> Duncan began writing the book after an editor, who had never seen a [[gothic fiction|gothic novel]] aimed at young adults, suggested she try coming up with one.<ref name=\"wdb\">{{cite book |last1=Duncan |first1=Lois |title=How to Write and Sell Your Personal Experiences |date=1979 |publisher=Writer's Digest Books |isbn=0-911654-74-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/howtowritesellyo00dunc/page/190 190\u2013192] |url=https://archive.org/details/howtowritesellyo00dunc/page/190 }}</ref> ''Down a Dark Hall'' is the only gothic novel that Duncan ever wrote.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Duncan |first1=Lois |title=Teacher Guides |url=https://loisduncan.arquettes.com/teacher's%20guide4.htm |website=loisduncan.arquettes.com |accessdate=May 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509221742/http://loisduncan.arquettes.com/teacher's%20guide4.htm |archive-date=May 9, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> A challenge that she had while writing the book was creating new descriptions for Blackwood's upstairs hallway each time Kit used it to walk to and from her room.

At least one-third of the board members are to be independent directors. The shareholding threshold for assessing director independence has been lowered to 5% from 10%. A director will no longer be independent if he or any immediate family member is a substantial shareholder with a 5% stake or more. Relationships between chairman and CEO must be disclosed if they are immediate family members. There will be a proposed 9 year limit on independent directors as a hard limit, or  the appointment of independent directors who have served more than nine years to be put to an annual vote requiring approval from majority of all shareholders and majority of non-controlling shareholders, with a transition period of three years to be provided regardless of the option adopted. Directors must be submitted for renomination and reappointment at least once every three years. If dividends are not paid, companies must state the reason.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Council of Singapore is proposing to force a \"nine-year rule\" that will reassess whether long-serving independent directors of listed companies will qualify as independent after being in that role for so long. The proposal was made in an effort to encourage companies to refresh and introduce more diversity into their boardrooms. The Singapore Exchange is seeking public feedback on whether it should be written into the Listing Rules, and public consultation will close on 15 March.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-corporate-governance-rules-proposed |title=New corporate governance rules proposed |website=The Straits Times |access-date=18 October 2019 |date=17 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Proposed stock market trading link with Bursa Malaysia ===\nOn 6 February 2018, the [[Singapore Exchange]] (SGX) and [[Bursa Malaysia]] announced a proposed stock market trading link which will be operational by end-2018.

At least one-third of the board members are to be independent directors. The shareholding threshold for assessing director independence has been lowered to 5% from 10%. A director will no longer be independent if he or any immediate family member is a substantial shareholder with a 5% stake or more. Relationships between chairman and CEO must be disclosed if they are immediate family members. There will be a proposed 9 year limit on independent directors as a hard limit, or  the appointment of independent directors who have served more than nine years to be put to an annual vote requiring approval from majority of all shareholders and majority of non-controlling shareholders, with a transition period of three years to be provided regardless of the option adopted. Directors must be submitted for renomination and reappointment at least once every three years. If dividends are not paid, companies must state the reason.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Council of Singapore is proposing to force a \"nine-year rule\" that will reassess whether long-serving independent directors of listed companies will qualify as independent after being in that role for so long. The proposal was made in an effort to encourage companies to refresh and introduce more diversity into their boardrooms. The Singapore Exchange is seeking public feedback on whether it should be written into the Listing Rules, and public consultation will close on 15 March.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-corporate-governance-rules-proposed |title=New corporate governance rules proposed |website=The Straits Times |access-date=18 October 2019 |date=17 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Proposed stock market trading link with Bursa Malaysia ===\nOn 6 February 2018, the [[Singapore Exchange]] (SGX) and [[Bursa Malaysia]] announced a proposed stock market trading link which will be operational by end-2018.
