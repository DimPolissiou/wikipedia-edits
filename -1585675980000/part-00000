Shane Vendrell, with new partner Armando \"Army\" Renta ([[Michael Pe\u00f1a]]), enters into a dangerous situation when trying to control major drug lord [[Antwon Mitchell]] ([[Anthony Anderson]]), and seemingly accepts an order to kill Vic Mackey.

The season also deals with the controversial asset-forfeiture policies of the new captain; Julien Lowe's opposition to these policies; and City Councilman David Aceveda's dealing with the psychological aftermath of his sexual assault incident from the previous season. The season concludes with Capt. Rawling's losing her job over a dispute with the DEA.\n\nOther plots involve Claudette and Dutch's marginalization as detectives, because of Claudette's refusal to apologize to the DA for reopening the cases of a public defender discovered to have been a functioning drug addict. Claudette's moral stand results in many of the prosecutors' cases being overturned. This costs Claudette her shot at becoming the Farmington Captain. Dutch attempts to resolve the situation by making a back-room deal with the DA to \"keep Claudette in line\" and do favors for the office in return for breaking back into action. Ultimately, this causes a rift between Claudette and Dutch, in  which Dutch confronts Claudette after she rebukes him for making the deal.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Shield: Season 4|first=Cynthia|last=Fuchs|publisher=PopMatters|date=January 23, 2006|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/shield-season-4-dvd/|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= The Shield: Season 4|work=Pop Matters|date=January 23, 2006|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/shield-season-4-dvd/|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{Episode table |background=#3A6141 |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=42\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=The Cure\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2005|3|15}}\n |ProdCode=5012-04-401\n |WrittenBy=[[Glen Mazzara]]\n |DirectedBy=[[Scott Brazil]]\n |ShortSummary=Vic is no longer the cop he used to be, acting adrift after his past actions have caught up to him.

Mackey also sees it as a way to put the Mexicans at war with the Armenian mob to protect himself and his family, as well as securing an ICE position given that he has been forced into retirement by the police. Mackey promises that he will also get Gardocki a similar deal or else they will run together. Vendrell, despite having the written confession against Mackey to use as leverage, tries to work with Mackey and Gardocki, knowing putting away the Armenians would also protect his family. A meeting between the Armenians and cartel is arranged, one which Mackey expects the Armenians will be wiped out; as he still does not trust Vendrell, Mackey has Gardocki tamper with his sidearm, and when Vendrell is at the meeting, he barely escapes with his life, and arranges with a small-time crook to perform simultaneous hits on Mackey and Gardocki. The attack falls through, and the cops discover from the crook of Vendrell's involvement. Vendrell goes on the run with Mara and Jackson, while Mackey relinquishes his badge so he can pursue Vendrell. Wyms begins a full investigation of Mackey's corruption. Mackey puts weight on Murray to secure [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]] should he provide ICE with the captivity of the cartel.\n\nVendrell fully blames Mackey for his situation, and has Mara coerce Corrine via phone call in providing them with information on the police's search activities, asserting she is as involved as Mackey is in his corruption. Fearing being caught in the middle of Mackey and Vendrell's war, Corrine contacts the Barn requesting witness protection and offers to help with their investigation. To coerce Mackey, Wyms appears to arrest Corrine while Mackey is watching. Mackey pushes on Murray to secure Corrine's immunity alongside his, but foregoing Gardocki's immunity without telling him. Murray is able to pull the right strings, but only on the conditions that Mackey tell them every illegal activity, and that pursuant to his ICE position, he follow their regulations exactly. Mackey proceeds to give all the details of the crimes, stunning Murray, her superior, and Wyms and Dutch, who arrive after getting a tip about Mackey's location. Wyms becomes furious that Mackey has effectively protected himself from police arrest.\n\nMeanwhile, Vendrell learns Corrine was working with the cops, and keep his family on the run. He contacts Mackey to try to hold his blackmail over him, but Mackey reveals his ICE deal. Without any other options, Vendrell poisons Mara and Jackson, and then shoots himself after writing a confession just as the cops arrive. Meanwhile, Mackey and Gardocki trick both the cartel and black drug gangs into an ICE trap, successful arresting the leadership and their drug supply, which Aceveda uses as a publicity stunt for his mayoral campaign. The Barn notifies them of Vendrell's suicide. When Mackey arrives, Wyms accosts him, showing that Vendrell confessed his actions were a result of Mackey's own, but knows there's nothing she can do him. Wyms publicly orders Gardocki's arrest for numerous crimes; Gardocki yells at Mackey, learning he has betrayed him.\n\nThe series concludes with Corrine and the children being placed into witness protection, Wyms admitting to Dutch that her medication no longer works and she will keep her position until she dies, and Mackey being told by Murray that he will be forced to desk work at ICE, unlikely to be on the street any time soon, and any step out of line will lead to him violating his agreement and being arrested for the crimes he confessed to. The show ends as Mackey, at the ICE offices after hours, hearing police sirens race down the road. He thinks for a moment, grabs his gun, and leaves.\n{{Episode table |background=#034A4E |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=76\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Coefficient of Drag\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|9|2}}\n |ProdCode=5012-07-701\n |WrittenBy=[[Kurt Sutter]]\n |DirectedBy=[[Guy Ferland]]\n |ShortSummary=Vic confronts Shane and deals with threats to his family, including Armenian hitman Ari Zadofian.

Aceveda works with the Justice Department to bring Detective [[List of The Shield characters#Terry Crowley|Terry Crowley]] onto the Strike Team to try to gain evidence to use on Vic. However, Vic is aware of Crowley's involvement due to his friendship with the Assistant Chief of Police Ben Gilroy; when the Strike Team is forced to shoot and kill Two-Time, a drug dealer, Vic and Detective [[Shane Vendrell]] use Two-Time's gun to murder Crowley (without informing team members [[Curtis Lemansky|Detective Curtis \"Lem\" Lemansky]] and [[Detective Ronnie Gardocki]]), making it look like Crowley was killed by Two-Time. Gilroy helps Vic to cover up the murder and stops Aceveda's investigation. Things come to a breaking point towards the end of the season when Gilroy's own ambitions threaten both Vic's and Aceveda's future.\n\nSeparately, rookie officer [[Julien Lowe]] learns the ropes from his training officer [[Danielle \"Danny\" Sofer]], as well as tries to hide his homosexuality from the others.

Julien backs out from his witness statement, leaving Aceveda with nothing to go on.\n\nDetective [[Holland \"Dutch\" Wagenbach]] and Detective [[Claudette Wyms]] hunt a serial killer targeting prostitutes while dealing with their own problems in The Barn.

Privately, the Strike Team learns that Armadillo has knowledge of some of their illicit activities and fear he will rat them out if he is taken to prison.

Shane Vendrell, with new partner Armando \"Army\" Renta ([[Michael Pe\u00f1a]]), enters into a dangerous situation when trying to control major drug lord [[Antwon Mitchell]] ([[Anthony Anderson]]), and seemingly accepts an order to kill Vic Mackey.

The season also deals with the controversial asset-forfeiture policies of the new captain; Julien Lowe's opposition to these policies; and City Councilman David Aceveda's dealing with the psychological aftermath of his sexual assault incident from the previous season. The season concludes with Capt. Rawling's losing her job over a dispute with the DEA.\n\nOther plots involve Claudette and Dutch's marginalization as detectives, because of Claudette's refusal to apologize to the DA for reopening the cases of a public defender discovered to have been a functioning drug addict. Claudette's moral stand results in many of the prosecutors' cases being overturned. This costs Claudette her shot at becoming the Farmington Captain. Dutch attempts to resolve the situation by making a back-room deal with the DA to \"keep Claudette in line\" and do favors for the office in return for breaking back into action. Ultimately, this causes a rift between Claudette and Dutch, in  which Dutch confronts Claudette after she rebukes him for making the deal.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Shield: Season 4|first=Cynthia|last=Fuchs|publisher=PopMatters|date=January 23, 2006|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/shield-season-4-dvd/|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= The Shield: Season 4|work=Pop Matters|date=January 23, 2006|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/shield-season-4-dvd/|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{Episode table |background=#3A6141 |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=42\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=The Cure\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2005|3|15}}\n |ProdCode=5012-04-401\n |WrittenBy=[[Glen Mazzara]]\n |DirectedBy=[[Scott Brazil]]\n |ShortSummary=Vic is no longer the cop he used to be, acting adrift after his past actions have caught up to him.

[[Jon Kavanaugh]]'s ([[Forest Whitaker]]) investigation of the Strike Team and one of the greatest threats the team has ever faced. As a result of Kavanaugh's turning one of Mackey's informants, IAD became aware of Lem's heroin theft and failure to report during the Antwon Mitchell investigation. Finding the heroin gave IAD sufficient evidence to arrest Lem, but Kavanaugh informs him about his theory of Terry Crowley's death and has Lem wear a wire to get evidence on the Strike Team. Lem is able to warn Mackey he is wired and Mackey uses it to embarrass IAD. Kavanaugh, applying pressure to the team in any way he can, finds out about Mackey's share of the money train haul. After Mackey sleeps with Kavanaugh's wife for further humiliation Kavanaugh arrests Lem and makes a deal with Mitchell. Mackey supports Lem and gets bail, while Vendrell worries Lem will give evidence against the team. The season concludes with Vendrell, fooled by Aceveda into believing Lem was going to turn on the Strike Team, murdering his friend and fellow team member with a hand grenade.\n\nOther plots include Dutch discovering Claudette has a chronic illness; Claudette's physical breaking point getting a killer from the past to confess; Steve Billings as the interim \"jellyfish yes-man\" Captain of the Barn; Sofer dealing with pregnancy and refusing to divulge the father's name; Julien training Tina, a pretty but inept rookie officer who Dutch has a crush on; and Claudette finally getting her opportunity for promotion to captain of the Barn, which she accepts on the sole condition that she gets to run the Barn her way.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Shield: The Detective & the Lieutenant|first=Quentin B.|last=Huff|publisher=PopMatters|date=May 9, 2007|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/the-shield-the-detective-the-lieutenant/|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Shield - Season 5|work= IGN|date=March 26, 2007|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/775/775779p1.html|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{Episode table |background=#999999 |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=55\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Extraction\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2006|1|10}}\n |ProdCode=5012-05-501\n |WrittenBy=[[Kurt Sutter]]\n |DirectedBy=[[D.

Mackey also sees it as a way to put the Mexicans at war with the Armenian mob to protect himself and his family, as well as securing an ICE position given that he has been forced into retirement by the police. Mackey promises that he will also get Gardocki a similar deal or else they will run together. Vendrell, despite having the written confession against Mackey to use as leverage, tries to work with Mackey and Gardocki, knowing putting away the Armenians would also protect his family. A meeting between the Armenians and cartel is arranged, one which Mackey expects the Armenians will be wiped out; as he still does not trust Vendrell, Mackey has Gardocki tamper with his sidearm, and when Vendrell is at the meeting, he barely escapes with his life, and arranges with a small-time crook to perform simultaneous hits on Mackey and Gardocki. The attack falls through, and the cops discover from the crook of Vendrell's involvement. Vendrell goes on the run with Mara and Jackson, while Mackey relinquishes his badge so he can pursue Vendrell. Wyms begins a full investigation of Mackey's corruption. Mackey puts weight on Murray to secure [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]] should he provide ICE with the captivity of the cartel.\n\nVendrell fully blames Mackey for his situation, and has Mara coerce Corrine via phone call in providing them with information on the police's search activities, asserting she is as involved as Mackey is in his corruption. Fearing being caught in the middle of Mackey and Vendrell's war, Corrine contacts the Barn requesting witness protection and offers to help with their investigation. To coerce Mackey, Wyms appears to arrest Corrine while Mackey is watching. Mackey pushes on Murray to secure Corrine's immunity alongside his, but foregoing Gardocki's immunity without telling him. Murray is able to pull the right strings, but only on the conditions that Mackey tell them every illegal activity, and that pursuant to his ICE position, he follow their regulations exactly. Mackey proceeds to give all the details of the crimes, stunning Murray, her superior, and Wyms and Dutch, who arrive after getting a tip about Mackey's location. Wyms becomes furious that Mackey has effectively protected himself from police arrest.\n\nMeanwhile, Vendrell learns Corrine was working with the cops, and keep his family on the run. He contacts Mackey to try to hold his blackmail over him, but Mackey reveals his ICE deal. Without any other options, Vendrell poisons Mara and Jackson, and then shoots himself after writing a confession just as the cops arrive. Meanwhile, Mackey and Gardocki trick both the cartel and black drug gangs into an ICE trap, successful arresting the leadership and their drug supply, which Aceveda uses as a publicity stunt for his mayoral campaign. The Barn notifies them of Vendrell's suicide. When Mackey arrives, Wyms accosts him, showing that Vendrell confessed his actions were a result of Mackey's own, but knows there's nothing she can do him. Wyms publicly orders Gardocki's arrest for numerous crimes; Gardocki yells at Mackey, learning he has betrayed him.\n\nThe series concludes with Corrine and the children being placed into witness protection, Wyms admitting to Dutch that her medication no longer works and she will keep her position until she dies, and Mackey being told by Murray that he will be forced to desk work at ICE, unlikely to be on the street any time soon, and any step out of line will lead to him violating his agreement and being arrested for the crimes he confessed to. The show ends as Mackey, at the ICE offices after hours, hearing police sirens race down the road. He thinks for a moment, grabs his gun, and leaves.\n{{Episode table |background=#034A4E |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=76\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Coefficient of Drag\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|9|2}}\n |ProdCode=5012-07-701\n |WrittenBy=[[Kurt Sutter]]\n |DirectedBy=[[Guy Ferland]]\n |ShortSummary=Vic confronts Shane and deals with threats to his family, including Armenian hitman Ari Zadofian.

As some of you will know I recently finished a 4-track EP of new songs. It was going to be 5, but the last song didn't feel properly finished and didn't really work with the others. I'll save it for a later date. Most of the music was recorded at home and, for the first time, I mixed the songs myself. They are a little lo-fi and intentionally not 'radio' or 'singles'. I tried to make them sound warm and natural and intimate, basically the kind of music I would listen to myself. I haven't found a label to put them out through yet, but I wanted you to hear them anyway. The first will be up on Monday (for a few days) via a link to my Soundcloud, and the others will go up on the following 3 Mondays.

As some of you will know I recently finished a 4-track EP of new songs. It was going to be 5, but the last song didn't feel properly finished and didn't really work with the others. I'll save it for a later date. Most of the music was recorded at home and, for the first time, I mixed the songs myself. They are a little lo-fi and intentionally not 'radio' or 'singles'. I tried to make them sound warm and natural and intimate, basically the kind of music I would listen to myself. I haven't found a label to put them out through yet, but I wanted you to hear them anyway. The first will be up on Monday (for a few days) via a link to my Soundcloud, and the others will go up on the following 3 Mondays.

It is the largest open space available in any of the city limits in [[Kerala]] state.]]\n\nIn [[land-use planning]], '''urban open space''' is [[open space reserve|open-space]] areas reserved for [[park]]s, \"green spaces\", and other open areas. The landscape of urban open spaces can range from [[playing field]]s to highly maintained environments to relatively [[natural landscape]]s. Generally considered open to the public, urban open spaces are sometimes privately owned, such as [[campus|higher education campuses]], [[community gardening|neighborhood/community parks/gardens]], and institutional or corporate grounds. Areas outside city boundaries, such as [[state park|state]] and [[national park]]s as well as open space in the countryside, are not considered urban open space. Streets, piazzas, plazas and urban squares are not always defined as urban open space in land use planning.\n\n==Scope==\n\n{{Merge from|Public open space|section=yes|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe terms \"urban open space\" can describe many types of open areas. One definition holds that, \"As the counterpart of development, urban open space is a natural and cultural resource, synonymous with neither 'unused land' nor 'park and recreation areas.\" Another is \"Open space is land and/or water area with its surface open to the sky, consciously acquired or publicly regulated to serve conservation and urban shaping function in addition to providing recreational opportunities.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Myers |first1=Marilyn |title=Decision Making in Allocating Metropolitan Open Space: State of the Art |journal=Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science |date=1975 |volume=78 |issue=3/4 |pages=149\u2013153 |doi=10.2307/3627339 |jstor=3627339 }}</ref> In almost all instances, the space referred to by the term is, in fact, green space.  However, there are examples of urban green space which, though not publicly owned/regulated, are still considered urban open space.\n\nFrom another standpoint public space in general is defined as the meeting or gathering places that exist outside the home and workplace that are generally accessible by members of the public, and which foster resident interaction and opportunities for contact and proximity.<ref name=\"Francis et al 2012\">{{cite journal |last1=Francis |first1=Jacinta |last2=Giles-Corti |first2=Billie |last3=Wood |first3=Lisa |last4=Knuiman |first4=Matthew |title=Creating sense of community: The role of public space |journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology |date=December 2012 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=401\u2013409 |doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2012.07.002 }}</ref> This definition implies a higher level of community interaction and places a focus on public involvement rather than public ownership or stewardship.[[File:WashingtonPark.jpg|right|thumb|Washington Park in [[Troy, New York|Troy, NY]], U.S., an example of privately owned urban open space|alt=A grassy area with tall trees leaving shadows from the sun above.

[[Recreation]] in urban open space may include active recreation (such as organized sports and individual exercise) or passive recreation, which may simply entail being in the open space. Research shows that when open spaces are attractive and accessible, people are more likely to engage in physical activity.<ref>Hartig, Terry.  \"Three steps to understanding restorative environments as health resources.\"  Open Space People Space.

A Toronto civic affairs bulletin entitled ''Urban Open Space: Luxury or Necessity'' makes the claim that \"popular awareness of the balance of nature, of natural processes and of man's place in and effect on nature \u2013 i.e., \"[[environmental awareness|ecological awareness]]\" \u2013 is important.  As humans live more and more in man-made surroundings \u2013 i.e., cities \u2013 he risks harming himself by building and acting in ignorance of natural processes.\"  Beyond this man-nature benefit, urban open spaces also serve as islands of nature, promoting [[biodiversity]] and providing a home for natural species in environments that are otherwise uninhabitable due to [[urban development|city development]].\n\nBy having the opportunity to be within an urban green space, people gain a higher appreciation for the nature around them. As [[Bill McKibben]] mentions in his book ''The End of Nature'', people will only truly understand nature if they are immersed within it. He follows in [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s footsteps when he isolated himself in the Adirondack Mountains in order to get away from society and the overwhelming ideals it carries. Even there he writes how society and human impact follows him as he sees airplanes buzzing overhead or hears the roar of motorboats in the distance.\n\n===Aesthetic===\nThe [[aesthetic value]] of urban open spaces is self-evident.  People enjoy viewing nature, especially when it is otherwise extensively deprived, as is the case in urban environments.  Therefore, open space offers the value of \"substituting gray infrastructure.\"<ref name=\"Eysenbach, Mary 2008\">Eysenbach, Mary.  \"Park System Function and Services.\" From Recreation to Re-creation.

Both examples of green spaces in urban areas illustrate how individual's environment can affect mental health and highlight the importance of access to green spaces.\n\nFurthermore, there are several strategies that policymakers have pursued in order to increase the amount of green space in urban areas.  Two are explored here: a case study in Toronto's redevelopment of Brownfield sites, and a broad analysis of city-wide planning strategies.\n\n====Impacts on high temperatures====\nUrban areas tend to have higher temperatures than their surrounding undeveloped areas because of [[urban heat island|Urban Heat Island]]s, UHIs. Urban heat islands are areas with man-made infrastructure that contribute to the increased temperatures <ref name=EPA /><ref name= Rizwan55>{{cite journal |last1=Rizwan |first1=Ahmed Memon |last2=Dennis |first2=Leung |last3=Liu |first3=Chunho |title=A Review on the Generation, Determination, and Mitigation of Urban Heat Island |journal=Journal of Environmental Sciences |date=2008 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=120\u20138 |doi=10.1016/S1001-0742(08)60019-4 |pmid=18572534 }}</ref>. The average temperature during the day in cities can be 18-27 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in the surrounding rural regions <ref name= EPA />. This is an example of one type of UHI, surface heat islands. Surface heat islands encompass the area from the ground to the top of the tree-line. It is usually higher during the day when direct sunlight reaches urban structures (often with darker materials than natural areas) including the main contributor, pavement. The other type of UHI, atmospheric heat islands, are from above the tree-line to the level in the atmosphere where the urban area no longer has an effect. This type of heat island has increased heat at night due to the release of heat from infrastructure that built up throughout the day <ref name= EPA />. \n\nGreen spaces within urban areas can help reduce these increased temperatures through shading and evapotranspiration<ref name= Rizwan55 /><ref name= Yujia54>{{cite journal |last1=Zhanga |first1=Yujia |last2=Murray |first2=Alan |last3=Turner |first3=B |title=Optimizing green space locations to reduce daytime and nighttime urban heat island effects in Phoenix, Arizona |journal=Landscape and Urban Planning |date=Sep 2017 |volume=165 |page=162\u2013171 |doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.04.009 }}</ref>. Shading comes from the taller plants, such as trees, planted in green spaces that can contribute to lowering the surface heat island effect. The shade provides protection from the sun for vulnerable populations, such as children, during periods of increased temperature, during the summer months or during a heat wave. Tree cover prevents some solar radiation from reaching the ground with its leaves and branches <ref name=Shishegar43 /><ref name= EPA />. This reduces the effect of surface urban heat islands. Open spaces that include any type of vegetation help offset the high temperatures through the natural process of evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration releases water into the air therefore dissipating heat<ref name=Shishegar43 />. There are many elements of an urban open space that can contribute to the mitigation of urban heat islands including the type of open space (park or nature reserve), type of plant species, and the density of vegetation<ref name=Shishegar43 />. Green spaces contribute to the reduction of local heat, decreasing the overall effect of UHIs. The larger the distribution of green spaces, the bigger the area of heat reduction. Green spaces that are clustered together will have an additive heat reduction resulting in a greater decrease in temperature in the local area compared to surrounding areas<ref name= Yujia54 />.\n\n====Impacts on air quality====\nHuman activity has increased [[air pollution]] in the earth's atmosphere and trees play an essential role in removing human-made pollutants from the air, aka [[particulate matter]] (PM). Trees produce oxygen and absorb CO<small>2</small>. In urban green spaces, trees filter out man-made pollutants. [[Air quality]] data collected on cities with and without urban green space has shown that areas with an abundance of trees have considerably less air pollutants, i.e. [[ozone|O<small>3</small>]], PM<small>10</small>, [[nitrous oxide|NO<small>2</small>]], SO<small>2</small>, and CO.<ref name=Nowak49>{{cite web |last1=Nowak |first1=David |title=The Effects of Urban Trees on Air Quality |url=https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/units/urban/local-resources/downloads/Tree_Air_Qual.pdf |website=USDA Forest Service |publisher=USDA Forest Service}}</ref> As air pollutants accumulate in the atmosphere, vulnerable populations, such as children, may suffer from increased incidences of respiratory disease<ref name=Nowak49 />.

Children spend most of their time at school, around 10 hours daily, and the indoor and outdoor air has a large impact on their health. Schools located in urban areas have higher particulate matter than schools in rural areas. Compared with children in schools located in rural areas, children who attend schools located in industrial areas and urban cities have higher levels of urinary PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) metabolites, which is linked to air pollution.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oliveria |first1=M. |last2=Slezakova |first2=K. |last3=Delerue-Matos |first3=C. |last4=Morais |first4=S. |title=Children environmental exposure to particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and biomonitoring in school environments: A review on indoor and outdoor exposure levels, major sources, and health impacts |journal= Environment International|date=Mar 2019 |volume=124 |pages=180\u2013204 |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2018.12.052 |pmid=30654326 }}</ref>\n\nThere are two different ways that green spaces can reduce the pollution of particulate matter including preventing distribution of particulate from pollutants or by reducing the particulate matter from traveling to other places<ref name= air51 />.

The first step was motivation.  In 1954, [[Hurricane Hazel]] hit the city and caused considerable damage.  The city subsequently obtained \"flood lands\" as a buffer to protect against future hurricanes.  Later, there was an impetus to convert contaminated brownfields into greenspace for the perceived benefits, the top reasons being the creation of ecological habitats and to provide recreational opportunities.  After establishing the motivation, the second step was to conduct a survey of all the Brownfield sites.  Although the City of Toronto was responsible for the management of Brownfield sites, they had limited resources to do so. They began by taking an inventory of all the land that could be considered Brownfields.  By contrast, the greenspace is much more actively managed by both the City of Toronto and the Toronto Region Conservation Authority.  Over 12% of the urban land in Toronto is classified as green space.  The third step involved holding meetings with both public and private stakeholders. Including the local neighborhood in the decision making process was seen as key to securing the cooperation of the public.  Because there was little perceived economic gain by private stakeholders, the redevelopment project was largely carried out by the public sector.  The fourth step was delegation.  A single department was put in charge of the project, which in this case was the municipal government's Parks Department (the government absorbed 90-100% of the implementation costs).  It was expected that implementation would take several years after delegation \u2013 in this case, redevelopment took between 3\u20135 years for each individual site.  The fifth step was collaboration with other government agencies.  Government agencies that shared land in common with the municipal government, such as flood plains and waterfronts, negotiated with each other in order to ensure the concurrency of the goals between the various agencies and Toronto's redevelopment efforts.   A sixth step involved the acquisition of private land, which was either donated or purchased by the city.  It is important to recognize that a substantial amount of Brownfield sites may reside on private land, and that a city must legally acquire it in order to implement redevelopment.  The seventh step assessed each site individually.  Because the sites were contaminated to different degrees, specific cleanup criteria were determined for each site, with various remediation strategies for each.  The most common method was to cap (bury) the contaminants in situ.  None of this could have happened unless there was a prerequisite zeroth step: creating an atmosphere of high trust. The City of Toronto was trusted by its citizens, and that trust enabled the city to redevelop Brownfield sites.  The public sector was expected to do its job and to prevent people using the new green space from being exposed to contaminants.  CITY-WIDE GREEN SPACE PLANNING:  The concept that ecosystems provide services that improve quality of life for city residents is becoming more and more recognized.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kabisch |first1=Nadja |title=Ecosystem service implementation and governance challenges in urban green space planning\u2014The case of Berlin, Germany |journal=Land Use Policy |date=January 2015 |volume=42 |pages=557\u2013567 |doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.09.005 }}</ref>  With that recognition, a shift in understanding green space from being an aesthetic contribution to city beautification to an essential part of the urban center is occurring.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haaland |first1=Christine |last2=van den Bosch |first2=Cecil Konijnendijk |title=Challenges and strategies for urban green-space planning in cities undergoing densification: A review |journal=Urban Forestry & Urban Greening |date=2015 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=760\u2013771 |doi=10.1016/j.ufug.2015.07.009 }}</ref>  However, city planners are increasingly faced with [[densification]] and population increase in urban centers.  This places stress on existing green spaces and can inhibit the creation of new green spaces.  Interestingly, [[per capita GDP]] was found to be positively correlated with the amount of green space coverage.  This suggests that economic systems that facilitate the [[accumulation of wealth]] can provision a city with increased green space.  This must be balanced with the finding that greening efforts in low income sections of a city can cause rents to rise and make [[affordable housing|housing less affordable]] there. Additionally, it was found that European cities that distributed the management of green space among several governmental agencies were less successful in green space planning compared to cities with only one agency responsible.  Lack of public awareness about the value of urban green space can also lead to less stakeholder contribution to green space planning.  This suggests that public education can lead the population to more fully participate as informed stakeholders to a much greater extent.  Additionally, improvement in the quality of green space can be pursued when no additional green space can be added.  Furthermore, the concept of \"green fingers,\" can be implemented in city-wide planning in order to optimize green space geometry.  \"Green fingers\" is a strategy that connects urban green space from the city center to the periphery, thereby linking the rural to the urban in a continuous fashion and enabling better resident access.  Developing [[green roof]]s, gardens, and facades may be appropriate strategies for private land and buildings, but these cannot fulfill the functions of a public green space.  Nevertheless they provide valuable contributions to resident quality of life, and can be supported by various tax beak incentives.  Finally, heritage green space sites can be protected by various laws and regulations.  All in all, the implementation of urban green space strategies must consider the entire urban region in question in order to achieve the overarching goal to provide urban residents with a higher [[quality of life]].\n\nWhile the current research on the impacts of green space of mental health appears broad, the future of green space is still of utmost importance.  Many US cities have unique plans to address this issue, while others are already experiencing the effects of reduced greenspace.  [[Denver]], for example, once boasted a meager 20% of the city having been paved or built-over in the mid-1970s.  However, this number could reach closer to 70% by 2040 due to an explosion of the city's population.{{fact|date=April 2019}} The hyper-functionality of modern-day cities must also be able to exist in a way that portrays beauty in the infrastructure itself.  One proposed solution to this involves shifting grey infrastructure made of [[concrete]] towards green infrastructure that looks less industrial and more like an ecosystem.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |last1=Houlden |first1=Victoria |last2=Weich |first2=Scott |last3=Jarvis |first3=Stephen |title=A cross-sectional analysis of green space prevalence and mental wellbeing in England |journal=BMC Public Health |date=17 May 2017 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=460 |doi=10.1186/s12889-017-4401-x |pmid=28693451 |pmc=5527375 }}</ref> This proposal, brought forth by the California Center for Sustainable Communities, accompanies another idea that cities should assess green space initiatives based on their cultural and natural assets.

The landscape of urban open spaces can range from [[playing field]]s to highly maintained environments to relatively [[natural landscape]]s. Generally considered open to the public, urban open spaces are sometimes privately owned, such as [[campus|higher education campuses]], [[community gardening|neighborhood/community parks/gardens]], and institutional or corporate grounds.

One definition holds that, \"As the counterpart of development, urban open space is a natural and cultural resource, synonymous with neither 'unused land' nor 'park and recreation areas.\" Another is \"Open space is land and/or water area with its surface open to the sky, consciously acquired or publicly regulated to serve conservation and urban shaping function in addition to providing recreational opportunities.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Myers |first1=Marilyn |title=Decision Making in Allocating Metropolitan Open Space: State of the Art |journal=Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science |date=1975 |volume=78 |issue=3/4 |pages=149\u2013153 |doi=10.2307/3627339 |jstor=3627339 }}</ref> In almost all instances, the space referred to by the term is, in fact, green space.

A Toronto civic affairs bulletin entitled ''Urban Open Space: Luxury or Necessity'' makes the claim that \"popular awareness of the balance of nature, of natural processes and of man's place in and effect on nature \u2013 i.e., \"[[environmental awareness|ecological awareness]]\" \u2013 is important.  As humans live more and more in man-made surroundings \u2013 i.e., cities \u2013 he risks harming himself by building and acting in ignorance of natural processes.\"  Beyond this man-nature benefit, urban open spaces also serve as islands of nature, promoting [[biodiversity]] and providing a home for natural species in environments that are otherwise uninhabitable due to [[urban development|city development]].\n\nBy having the opportunity to be within an urban green space, people gain a higher appreciation for the nature around them. As [[Bill McKibben]] mentions in his book ''The End of Nature'', people will only truly understand nature if they are immersed within it. He follows in [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s footsteps when he isolated himself in the Adirondack Mountains in order to get away from society and the overwhelming ideals it carries. Even there he writes how society and human impact follows him as he sees airplanes buzzing overhead or hears the roar of motorboats in the distance.\n\n===Aesthetic===\nThe [[aesthetic value]] of urban open spaces is self-evident.  People enjoy viewing nature, especially when it is otherwise extensively deprived, as is the case in urban environments.  Therefore, open space offers the value of \"substituting gray infrastructure.\"<ref name=\"Eysenbach, Mary 2008\">Eysenbach, Mary.  \"Park System Function and Services.\" From Recreation to Re-creation.

Two are explored here: a case study in Toronto's redevelopment of Brownfield sites, and a broad analysis of city-wide planning strategies.\n\n====Impacts on high temperatures====\nUrban areas tend to have higher temperatures than their surrounding undeveloped areas because of [[urban heat island|Urban Heat Island]]s, UHIs. Urban heat islands are areas with man-made infrastructure that contribute to the increased temperatures <ref name=EPA /><ref name= Rizwan55>{{cite journal |last1=Rizwan |first1=Ahmed Memon |last2=Dennis |first2=Leung |last3=Liu |first3=Chunho |title=A Review on the Generation, Determination, and Mitigation of Urban Heat Island |journal=Journal of Environmental Sciences |date=2008 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=120\u20138 |doi=10.1016/S1001-0742(08)60019-4 |pmid=18572534 }}</ref>. The average temperature during the day in cities can be 18-27 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in the surrounding rural regions <ref name= EPA />. This is an example of one type of UHI, surface heat islands. Surface heat islands encompass the area from the ground to the top of the tree-line. It is usually higher during the day when direct sunlight reaches urban structures (often with darker materials than natural areas) including the main contributor, pavement. The other type of UHI, atmospheric heat islands, are from above the tree-line to the level in the atmosphere where the urban area no longer has an effect. This type of heat island has increased heat at night due to the release of heat from infrastructure that built up throughout the day <ref name= EPA />. \n\nGreen spaces within urban areas can help reduce these increased temperatures through shading and evapotranspiration<ref name= Rizwan55 /><ref name= Yujia54>{{cite journal |last1=Zhanga |first1=Yujia |last2=Murray |first2=Alan |last3=Turner |first3=B |title=Optimizing green space locations to reduce daytime and nighttime urban heat island effects in Phoenix, Arizona |journal=Landscape and Urban Planning |date=Sep 2017 |volume=165 |page=162\u2013171 |doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.04.009 }}</ref>. Shading comes from the taller plants, such as trees, planted in green spaces that can contribute to lowering the surface heat island effect. The shade provides protection from the sun for vulnerable populations, such as children, during periods of increased temperature, during the summer months or during a heat wave. Tree cover prevents some solar radiation from reaching the ground with its leaves and branches <ref name=Shishegar43 /><ref name= EPA />. This reduces the effect of surface urban heat islands. Open spaces that include any type of vegetation help offset the high temperatures through the natural process of evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration releases water into the air therefore dissipating heat<ref name=Shishegar43 />. There are many elements of an urban open space that can contribute to the mitigation of urban heat islands including the type of open space (park or nature reserve), type of plant species, and the density of vegetation<ref name=Shishegar43 />. Green spaces contribute to the reduction of local heat, decreasing the overall effect of UHIs. The larger the distribution of green spaces, the bigger the area of heat reduction. Green spaces that are clustered together will have an additive heat reduction resulting in a greater decrease in temperature in the local area compared to surrounding areas<ref name= Yujia54 />.\n\n====Impacts on air quality====\nHuman activity has increased [[air pollution]] in the earth's atmosphere and trees play an essential role in removing human-made pollutants from the air, aka [[particulate matter]] (PM). Trees produce oxygen and absorb CO<small>2</small>. In urban green spaces, trees filter out man-made pollutants. [[Air quality]] data collected on cities with and without urban green space has shown that areas with an abundance of trees have considerably less air pollutants, i.e. [[ozone|O<small>3</small>]], PM<small>10</small>, [[nitrous oxide|NO<small>2</small>]], SO<small>2</small>, and CO.<ref name=Nowak49>{{cite web |last1=Nowak |first1=David |title=The Effects of Urban Trees on Air Quality |url=https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/units/urban/local-resources/downloads/Tree_Air_Qual.pdf |website=USDA Forest Service |publisher=USDA Forest Service}}</ref> As air pollutants accumulate in the atmosphere, vulnerable populations, such as children, may suffer from increased incidences of respiratory disease<ref name=Nowak49 />.

The first step was motivation.  In 1954, [[Hurricane Hazel]] hit the city and caused considerable damage.  The city subsequently obtained \"flood lands\" as a buffer to protect against future hurricanes.  Later, there was an impetus to convert contaminated brownfields into greenspace for the perceived benefits, the top reasons being the creation of ecological habitats and to provide recreational opportunities.  After establishing the motivation, the second step was to conduct a survey of all the Brownfield sites.  Although the City of Toronto was responsible for the management of Brownfield sites, they had limited resources to do so. They began by taking an inventory of all the land that could be considered Brownfields.  By contrast, the greenspace is much more actively managed by both the City of Toronto and the Toronto Region Conservation Authority.  Over 12% of the urban land in Toronto is classified as green space.  The third step involved holding meetings with both public and private stakeholders. Including the local neighborhood in the decision making process was seen as key to securing the cooperation of the public.  Because there was little perceived economic gain by private stakeholders, the redevelopment project was largely carried out by the public sector.  The fourth step was delegation.  A single department was put in charge of the project, which in this case was the municipal government's Parks Department (the government absorbed 90-100% of the implementation costs).  It was expected that implementation would take several years after delegation \u2013 in this case, redevelopment took between 3\u20135 years for each individual site.  The fifth step was collaboration with other government agencies.  Government agencies that shared land in common with the municipal government, such as flood plains and waterfronts, negotiated with each other in order to ensure the concurrency of the goals between the various agencies and Toronto's redevelopment efforts.   A sixth step involved the acquisition of private land, which was either donated or purchased by the city.  It is important to recognize that a substantial amount of Brownfield sites may reside on private land, and that a city must legally acquire it in order to implement redevelopment.  The seventh step assessed each site individually.  Because the sites were contaminated to different degrees, specific cleanup criteria were determined for each site, with various remediation strategies for each.  The most common method was to cap (bury) the contaminants in situ.  None of this could have happened unless there was a prerequisite zeroth step: creating an atmosphere of high trust. The City of Toronto was trusted by its citizens, and that trust enabled the city to redevelop Brownfield sites.  The public sector was expected to do its job and to prevent people using the new green space from being exposed to contaminants.  CITY-WIDE GREEN SPACE PLANNING:  The concept that ecosystems provide services that improve quality of life for city residents is becoming more and more recognized.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kabisch |first1=Nadja |title=Ecosystem service implementation and governance challenges in urban green space planning\u2014The case of Berlin, Germany |journal=Land Use Policy |date=January 2015 |volume=42 |pages=557\u2013567 |doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.09.005 }}</ref>  With that recognition, a shift in understanding green space from being an aesthetic contribution to city beautification to an essential part of the urban center is occurring.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haaland |first1=Christine |last2=van den Bosch |first2=Cecil Konijnendijk |title=Challenges and strategies for urban green-space planning in cities undergoing densification: A review |journal=Urban Forestry & Urban Greening |date=2015 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=760\u2013771 |doi=10.1016/j.ufug.2015.07.009 }}</ref>  However, city planners are increasingly faced with [[densification]] and population increase in urban centers.  This places stress on existing green spaces and can inhibit the creation of new green spaces.  Interestingly, [[per capita GDP]] was found to be positively correlated with the amount of green space coverage.  This suggests that economic systems that facilitate the [[accumulation of wealth]] can provision a city with increased green space.  This must be balanced with the finding that greening efforts in low income sections of a city can cause rents to rise and make [[affordable housing|housing less affordable]] there. Additionally, it was found that European cities that distributed the management of green space among several governmental agencies were less successful in green space planning compared to cities with only one agency responsible.  Lack of public awareness about the value of urban green space can also lead to less stakeholder contribution to green space planning.  This suggests that public education can lead the population to more fully participate as informed stakeholders to a much greater extent.  Additionally, improvement in the quality of green space can be pursued when no additional green space can be added.  Furthermore, the concept of \"green fingers,\" can be implemented in city-wide planning in order to optimize green space geometry.  \"Green fingers\" is a strategy that connects urban green space from the city center to the periphery, thereby linking the rural to the urban in a continuous fashion and enabling better resident access.  Developing [[green roof]]s, gardens, and facades may be appropriate strategies for private land and buildings, but these cannot fulfill the functions of a public green space.  Nevertheless they provide valuable contributions to resident quality of life, and can be supported by various tax beak incentives.  Finally, heritage green space sites can be protected by various laws and regulations.  All in all, the implementation of urban green space strategies must consider the entire urban region in question in order to achieve the overarching goal to provide urban residents with a higher [[quality of life]].\n\nWhile the current research on the impacts of green space of mental health appears broad, the future of green space is still of utmost importance.  Many US cities have unique plans to address this issue, while others are already experiencing the effects of reduced greenspace.  [[Denver]], for example, once boasted a meager 20% of the city having been paved or built-over in the mid-1970s.  However, this number could reach closer to 70% by 2040 due to an explosion of the city's population.{{fact|date=April 2019}} The hyper-functionality of modern-day cities must also be able to exist in a way that portrays beauty in the infrastructure itself.  One proposed solution to this involves shifting grey infrastructure made of [[concrete]] towards green infrastructure that looks less industrial and more like an ecosystem.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |last1=Houlden |first1=Victoria |last2=Weich |first2=Scott |last3=Jarvis |first3=Stephen |title=A cross-sectional analysis of green space prevalence and mental wellbeing in England |journal=BMC Public Health |date=17 May 2017 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=460 |doi=10.1186/s12889-017-4401-x |pmid=28693451 |pmc=5527375 }}</ref> This proposal, brought forth by the California Center for Sustainable Communities, accompanies another idea that cities should assess green space initiatives based on their cultural and natural assets.

What would eventually become urban open green space began as [[plaza|paved public plazas]].  Though they were intended to be open to the public, these spaces began to be re-designated as private parks around the late eighteenth century.  It was during this period that the areas became pockets of green in the urban environment, commonly modelled after the natural wild of the countryside.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lawrence |first1=Henry W. |title=The Greening of the Squares of London: Transformation of Urban landscapes and Ideals |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |date=March 1993 |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=90\u2013118 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1993.tb01924.x }}</ref>\n\nThe first parks to reverse the trend of privatization and again be opened to the public were England's [[Royal Parks of London|royal parks]] in the nineteenth century.  This was done in response to the extensive and unexpected population movement from the country into cities.

Both trends focused on providing the public an opportunity to receive all of the perceived health and lifestyle benefits of having access to open space within urban environments.\n\n==Current trends==\nSegmentation of urban open spaces was particularly prominent in America during the twentieth century.  Since the late 1800's romantic park systems, open space designers have been concerned with guiding, containing or separating urban growth, distributing recreation, and/or producing scenic amenity, mostly within the framework of geometric abstractions.\"<ref>Roberts, William H.  \"Design of Metropolitan Open Space Based on Natural Process.\" Metropolitan Open Space and Natural Process.  Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1970.</ref>\nSuch segmentation was especially prominent in the 1990s, when urban open spaces took a path similar to that of parks, following the modernization trend of segmentation and specialization of areas.<ref name=young1995>Young, Terence.  \"Modern Urban Parks.\"  Geographical Review 1995.

Perhaps this increase in division of [[social class]]es' use of open space, demonstrated by the segmentation of the spaces, displays a situation similar to the privatization of London parks in the eighteenth century, which displayed a desire to make classes more distinct.\n\nToday, places like [[Scandinavia]], which do not have a significant history of outdoor recreation and gathering places,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} are seeing a proliferation of urban open spaces and adopting a lifestyle supported by the extra urban breathing room.  An example of this can be seen in [[Copenhagen]] where an area closed to car traffic in 1962 developed, in just a few decades, a culture of public political gatherings and outdoor cafes emerged.<ref>Gehl, Jan. \"Public Spaces for a Changing Public Life.\" Open Space People Space.

Together with an ostentatious crew led by Tayaji ([[Satish Kaushik]]) and cousin Jassi ([[Suhail Nayyar]]), he indulges in uncontrolled consumption of [[cocaine]]. Tommy is popular for his energetic songs with lyrics that often glorify violence and [[drug addiction]]. However, his addiction costs him his music contract and lands him in jail. In prison, he meets two of his die-hard fans who remark how Tommy's lifestyle had 'inspired' theirs, leading them to commit murder. Realizing that his songs have negatively affected teenagers, Tommy decides to change his ways upon release. A few days later, he engages in an altercation with Tayaji and accidentally shoots him, injuring his ear. Tayaji sends Tommy and his crew away to a farmhouse so that he can prepare for an upcoming concert.\n\nWorking on the farm is a [[Bihari people|Bihari]] migrant worker named Bauria ([[Alia Bhatt]]). Bauria's dreams of playing national-level hockey for the country were shattered, so she came to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] to work as a laborer. She works for a local landlord who uses agriculture as a front for drug-peddling. One night, she finds a suspicious packet on the farm and realizes that it is some kind of drug. She resolves to sell it but her search for a potential buyer lands her in trouble as she unwittingly contacts the original owners of the [[heroin]]. She is captured by the gang of drug peddlers but not before she discards it into a well. As a compensation for their lost drugs, the peddlers forcibly keep her at their house, where she is sexually and physically abused, given drugs, and prostituted to men. Some weeks later, she manages to escape.\n\nIn the neighboring town lives Preet Sahni ([[Kareena Kapoor]]), a doctor and activist who runs a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] center. Sartaj Singh ([[Diljit Dosanjh]]) is a junior policeman who knows about the drug smuggling his seniors are allowing. But when it affects his family, as his brother, Balli, overdoses and is brought to Preet's clinic, he realizes the grave situation. Preet and Sartaj decide to find the root cause of the problem together. Balli is admitted into her drug rehabilitation centre against his will.\n\nAt his concert, instead of singing, Tommy starts preaching. Infuriated by his speech about how one should lead one's life, his fans start throwing bottles at him. Tommy gets angry and urinates in front of the crowd before fleeing. He hides in an old structure and meets Bauria, also hiding. The two share their stories and bond. However, Bauria is recaptured by the same gang. Tommy learns the next day that an arrest warrant has been issued for him because of the public ruckus at the concert. He sets out to find Bauria after realising he is in love with her.\n\nPreet and Sartaj find that the driving force behind the drug problem in Punjab is an elderly man called Virender Singh, who has flourished with the support of [[Member of parliament|MP]] Maninder Brar. The two go to extreme measures to collect evidence against the politician and put together a report to be sent to the state's Election Commission to thwart Brar's campaign for another term in power. Sartaj and Preet fall in love; however, one night, Preet sees a manic Balli trying to escape from her rehab center. On trying to stop him, she is accidentally stabbed by him. The policemen who investigate her homicide, including senior officer Jhujar Singh, come across the report made by her and Sartaj. Since he is Sartaj's close friend, Jhujar decides to protect Balli by sending him underground. However, he is infuriated when he sees that he too has been named in the drug racket and calls Sartaj.\n\nIn the presence of the local drug mafia at their farmhouse (where Bauria is confined), a bruised and beaten Sartaj is questioned by Jhujar, who is a key member in the drug racket. Sartaj says whatever he did was for the sake of Punjab. At the same time, Tommy enters the house. Sartaj grabs Jhujar's pistol and shoots the whole gang before freeing Balli. Tommy helps Bauria escape from her captors. Balli kneels and cries in front of his brother, whose face is expressionless.\n\nIt is shown that the government issued an inquiry into Maninder Brar's activities and there has been a huge crackdown on the drug menace. In [[Goa]], amidst his crew members, Tommy calls Bauria to ask for her real name. Sitting by the beach, she catches sight of a foreigner having fun. Inspired, she utters \"Mary Jane\".{{efn|According to the director, \"Mary Jane\", as the name of Bhatt's character, is an allusion to the drug [[marijuana]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/%E2%80%9CI-want-to-make-mainstream-movies-but-not-by-losing-myself-in-the-process%E2%80%9D/article14395252.ece |title=\u201cI want to make mainstream movies but not by losing myself in the process\u201d |last=Ghosh |first=Sankhayan |date=2016-06-22 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=2018-07-26}}</ref>}}\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Shahid Kapoor]] as Tejinder \"Tommy\" Singh a.k.a.

Produced by [[Shobha Kapoor]] and [[Ekta Kapoor]] under their banner [[Balaji Motion Pictures]], in association with [[Anurag Kashyap]]'s production house [[Phantom Films]], it features an ensemble cast consisting of [[Shahid Kapoor]], [[Alia Bhatt]], [[Kareena Kapoor]] and [[Diljit Dosanjh]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Balaji Motion Pictures acquires Udta Punjab|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/5101275/Balaji-Motion-Pictures-acquires-Udta-Punjab|accessdate=10 March 2015|date=10 March 2015|publisher=[[Bollywood Hungama]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=I was the first to suggest that Kareena was perfect for Udta Punjab': Shahid Kapoor|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/i-was-the-first-to-suggest-that-kareena-was-perfect-for-udta-punjab-shahid-kapoor/|last=Gera|first=Sonal|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=9 February 2015|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 June 2016, the [[Central Board of Film Certification]] sought a stay on the film's release citing that the themes dealt with in the film were too vulgar for the general audience.

Together with an ostentatious crew led by Tayaji ([[Satish Kaushik]]) and cousin Jassi ([[Suhail Nayyar]]), he indulges in uncontrolled consumption of [[cocaine]]. Tommy is popular for his energetic songs with lyrics that often glorify violence and [[drug addiction]]. However, his addiction costs him his music contract and lands him in jail. In prison, he meets two of his die-hard fans who remark how Tommy's lifestyle had 'inspired' theirs, leading them to commit murder. Realizing that his songs have negatively affected teenagers, Tommy decides to change his ways upon release. A few days later, he engages in an altercation with Tayaji and accidentally shoots him, injuring his ear. Tayaji sends Tommy and his crew away to a farmhouse so that he can prepare for an upcoming concert.\n\nWorking on the farm is a [[Bihari people|Bihari]] migrant worker named Bauria ([[Alia Bhatt]]). Bauria's dreams of playing national-level hockey for the country were shattered, so she came to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] to work as a laborer. She works for a local landlord who uses agriculture as a front for drug-peddling. One night, she finds a suspicious packet on the farm and realizes that it is some kind of drug. She resolves to sell it but her search for a potential buyer lands her in trouble as she unwittingly contacts the original owners of the [[heroin]]. She is captured by the gang of drug peddlers but not before she discards it into a well. As a compensation for their lost drugs, the peddlers forcibly keep her at their house, where she is sexually and physically abused, given drugs, and prostituted to men. Some weeks later, she manages to escape.\n\nIn the neighboring town lives Preet Sahni ([[Kareena Kapoor]]), a doctor and activist who runs a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] center. Sartaj Singh ([[Diljit Dosanjh]]) is a junior policeman who knows about the drug smuggling his seniors are allowing. But when it affects his family, as his brother, Balli, overdoses and is brought to Preet's clinic, he realizes the grave situation. Preet and Sartaj decide to find the root cause of the problem together. Balli is admitted into her drug rehabilitation centre against his will.\n\nAt his concert, instead of singing, Tommy starts preaching. Infuriated by his speech about how one should lead one's life, his fans start throwing bottles at him. Tommy gets angry and urinates in front of the crowd before fleeing. He hides in an old structure and meets Bauria, also hiding. The two share their stories and bond. However, Bauria is recaptured by the same gang. Tommy learns the next day that an arrest warrant has been issued for him because of the public ruckus at the concert. He sets out to find Bauria after realising he is in love with her.\n\nPreet and Sartaj find that the driving force behind the drug problem in Punjab is an elderly man called Virender Singh, who has flourished with the support of [[Member of parliament|MP]] Maninder Brar. The two go to extreme measures to collect evidence against the politician and put together a report to be sent to the state's Election Commission to thwart Brar's campaign for another term in power. Sartaj and Preet fall in love; however, one night, Preet sees a manic Balli trying to escape from her rehab center. On trying to stop him, she is accidentally stabbed by him. The policemen who investigate her homicide, including senior officer Jhujar Singh, come across the report made by her and Sartaj. Since he is Sartaj's close friend, Jhujar decides to protect Balli by sending him underground. However, he is infuriated when he sees that he too has been named in the drug racket and calls Sartaj.\n\nIn the presence of the local drug mafia at their farmhouse (where Bauria is confined), a bruised and beaten Sartaj is questioned by Jhujar, who is a key member in the drug racket. Sartaj says whatever he did was for the sake of Punjab. At the same time, Tommy enters the house. Sartaj grabs Jhujar's pistol and shoots the whole gang before freeing Balli. Tommy helps Bauria escape from her captors. Balli kneels and cries in front of his brother, whose face is expressionless.\n\nIt is shown that the government issued an inquiry into Maninder Brar's activities and there has been a huge crackdown on the drug menace. In [[Goa]], amidst his crew members, Tommy calls Bauria to ask for her real name. Sitting by the beach, she catches sight of a foreigner having fun. Inspired, she utters \"Mary Jane\".{{efn|According to the director, \"Mary Jane\", as the name of Bhatt's character, is an allusion to the drug [[marijuana]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/%E2%80%9CI-want-to-make-mainstream-movies-but-not-by-losing-myself-in-the-process%E2%80%9D/article14395252.ece |title=\u201cI want to make mainstream movies but not by losing myself in the process\u201d |last=Ghosh |first=Sankhayan |date=2016-06-22 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=2018-07-26}}</ref>}}\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Shahid Kapoor]] as Tejinder \"Tommy\" Singh a.k.a.
