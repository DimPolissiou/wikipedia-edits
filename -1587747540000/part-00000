After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to \"Toyota\" from the family name \"Toyoda\". The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune. The original logo is no longer found on its vehicles but remains the corporate emblem used in Japan.\n\n[[File:Toyota logo.svg|thumb|left|Toyota wordmark, used as the main logo until 1989 and is currently used as a corporate logo]]\n[[File: Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro P4250811.jpg|thumb|left|[[Toyota Tacoma]] TRD Pro still uses Toyota wordmark]]\n\nStill, no guidelines existed for the use of the brand name, so \"TOYOTA\", which was used throughout most of the world, led to inconsistencies in its worldwide marketing campaigns.\n\nTo remedy this, Toyota introduced a new worldwide logo in October 1989 to commemorate the 50th year of the company, and to differentiate it from the newly released luxury Lexus brand. The logo made its debut on the 1989 Toyota Celsior and quickly gained worldwide recognition. The three ovals in the new logo combine to form the letter \"T\", which stands for Toyota. The overlapping of the two perpendicular ovals inside the larger oval represents the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between the customer and the company while the larger oval surrounding both of these inner ovals represents the \"global expansion of Toyota's technology and unlimited potential for the future\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/nov_dec_04.html |title=Company > Vision & Philosophy > Nov/Dec 2004 |publisher=TOYOTA |accessdate=October 31, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022095517/http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/nov_dec_04.html |archivedate=October 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/emblem/passion/ |title=Passion &#124; Toyota Motor Corporation Global Website |publisher=Toyota-global.com |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024915/http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/emblem/passion/ |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Toyota AA 1936 - Picture by Bertel Schmitt.jpg|thumb|Hubcap of 1936 Toyota AA, with the old \"Toyoda\" name]]\n\nThe new logo started appearing on all printed material, advertisements, dealer signage, and most of the vehicles themselves in 1990.\n\nIn countries or regions using [[traditional Chinese character]]s, e.g. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota is known as \"\u8c50\u7530\".<ref name=\"Crown Motors\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crown-motors.com/tch/corpinfo/story.aspx|title=Crown Motors Ltd.

selling vehicles in the United States of America\n}}\nToyota first entered the [[pickup truck]] market in 1947 with the [[Toyota SB|SB]] that was only sold in Japan and limited Asian markets. It was followed in 1954 by the [[Toyota RK|RK]] (renamed in 1959 as the [[Toyota Stout|Stout]]) and in 1968 by the compact [[Toyota Hilux|Hilux]]. With continued refinement, the Hilux (simply known as the Pickup in some markets) became famous for being extremely durable and reliable, and many of these trucks from as early as the late 1970s are still on the road today, some with over 300,000 miles. Extended- and crew-cab versions of these small haulers were eventually added, and Toyota continues to produce them today under various names depending on the market.\n\nRiding on the success of the [[compact pickup]]s in the US, Toyota decided to attempt to enter the traditionally domestic-dominated full-size pickup market, introducing the [[Toyota T100|T100]] for the 1993 US model year, with production ending in 1998. While having a bed at the traditional full-size length of 8 feet, the suspension and engine characteristics were still similar to that of a compact pickup. It proved to be as economical and reliable as any typical Toyota pickup, but sales never became what Toyota brass had hoped for. It was criticized as being too small to appeal to the traditional American full-size pickup buyer. Another popular full-size truck essential, a V8 engine, was never available. Additionally, the truck was at first only available as a regular cab, though Toyota addressed this shortcoming and added the Xtracab version in mid-1995.\n\nIn 1999 for the 2000 model year, Toyota replaced the T100 with the larger [[Toyota Tundra|Tundra]]. The Tundra addressed criticisms that the T100 did not have the look and feel of a legitimate American-style full-size pickup. It also added the V8 engine that the T100 was criticized for not having. However, the Tundra still came up short in towing capacity as well as still feeling slightly carlike. These concerns were addressed with an even larger 2007 redesign. A stronger V6 and a second V8 engine among other things were added to the option list. As of early 2010, the Tundra has captured 16% of the full-size half-ton market in the US.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The all-new Tundra was assembled in [[San Antonio, Texas]], US. Toyota assembled around 150,000 Standard and Double Cabs, and only 70,000 Crew Max's in 2007. The smaller Tacoma (which traces its roots back to the original Hilux) was also produced at the company's San Antonio facility.\n\nOutside the United States, Toyota produced the [[Toyota Hilux|Hilux]] in Standard and Double Cab, gasoline and diesel engine, and 2WD and 4WD versions. The BBC's ''Top Gear'' TV show featured two episodes of a Hilux that was deemed \"virtually indestructible\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series3episode5.shtml |title=Top Gear \u2013 Episode Archive \u2013 Series 3 |publisher=BBC |date=November 23, 2003 |accessdate=July 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106115656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series3episode5.shtml |archive-date=November 6, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Luxury-type vehicles====\n{{Further|List of Lexus vehicles}}\n[[File:2012 Toyota Crown-Royal 01.jpg|thumb|right|Toyota Crown Royal]]\n\nAs of 2009, the company sold nine luxury-branded models under its Lexus division, ranging from the [[Lexus LS|LS]] sedan to [[Lexus RX|RX]] crossover and [[Lexus LX|LX]] SUV.<ref name=Toyotaworld/> Luxury-type sedans produced under the Toyota brand included the [[Toyota Century|Century]], [[Toyota Crown|Crown]], and [[Toyota Crown Majesta|Crown Majesta]].<ref name=Toyotaworld/> A limited-edition model produced for the [[Emperor of Japan]] was the [[Toyota Century Royal|Century Royal]].

After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to \"Toyota\" from the family name \"Toyoda\". The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune. The original logo is no longer found on its vehicles but remains the corporate emblem used in Japan.\n\n[[File:Toyota logo.svg|thumb|left|Toyota wordmark, used as the main logo until 1989 and is currently used as a corporate logo]]\n[[File: Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro P4250811.jpg|thumb|left|[[Toyota Tacoma]] TRD Pro still uses Toyota wordmark]]\n\nStill, no guidelines existed for the use of the brand name, so \"TOYOTA\", which was used throughout most of the world, led to inconsistencies in its worldwide marketing campaigns.\n\nTo remedy this, Toyota introduced a new worldwide logo in October 1989 to commemorate the 50th year of the company, and to differentiate it from the newly released luxury Lexus brand. The logo made its debut on the 1989 Toyota Celsior and quickly gained worldwide recognition. The three ovals in the new logo combine to form the letter \"T\", which stands for Toyota. The overlapping of the two perpendicular ovals inside the larger oval represents the mutually beneficial relationship and trust between the customer and the company while the larger oval surrounding both of these inner ovals represents the \"global expansion of Toyota's technology and unlimited potential for the future\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/nov_dec_04.html |title=Company > Vision & Philosophy > Nov/Dec 2004 |publisher=TOYOTA |accessdate=October 31, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022095517/http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/vision/traditions/nov_dec_04.html |archivedate=October 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/emblem/passion/ |title=Passion &#124; Toyota Motor Corporation Global Website |publisher=Toyota-global.com |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024915/http://www.toyota-global.com/showroom/emblem/passion/ |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Toyota AA 1936 - Picture by Bertel Schmitt.jpg|thumb|Hubcap of 1936 Toyota AA, with the old \"Toyoda\" name]]\n\nThe new logo started appearing on all printed material, advertisements, dealer signage, and most of the vehicles themselves in 1990.\n\nIn countries or regions using [[traditional Chinese character]]s, e.g. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Toyota is known as \"\u8c50\u7530\".<ref name=\"Crown Motors\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crown-motors.com/tch/corpinfo/story.aspx|title=Crown Motors Ltd.

selling vehicles in the United States of America\n}}\nToyota first entered the [[pickup truck]] market in 1947 with the [[Toyota SB|SB]] that was only sold in Japan and limited Asian markets. It was followed in 1954 by the [[Toyota RK|RK]] (renamed in 1959 as the [[Toyota Stout|Stout]]) and in 1968 by the compact [[Toyota Hilux|Hilux]]. With continued refinement, the Hilux (simply known as the Pickup in some markets) became famous for being extremely durable and reliable, and many of these trucks from as early as the late 1970s are still on the road today, some with over 300,000 miles. Extended- and crew-cab versions of these small haulers were eventually added, and Toyota continues to produce them today under various names depending on the market.\n\nRiding on the success of the [[compact pickup]]s in the US, Toyota decided to attempt to enter the traditionally domestic-dominated full-size pickup market, introducing the [[Toyota T100|T100]] for the 1993 US model year, with production ending in 1998. While having a bed at the traditional full-size length of 8 feet, the suspension and engine characteristics were still similar to that of a compact pickup. It proved to be as economical and reliable as any typical Toyota pickup, but sales never became what Toyota brass had hoped for. It was criticized as being too small to appeal to the traditional American full-size pickup buyer. Another popular full-size truck essential, a V8 engine, was never available. Additionally, the truck was at first only available as a regular cab, though Toyota addressed this shortcoming and added the Xtracab version in mid-1995.\n\nIn 1999 for the 2000 model year, Toyota replaced the T100 with the larger [[Toyota Tundra|Tundra]]. The Tundra addressed criticisms that the T100 did not have the look and feel of a legitimate American-style full-size pickup. It also added the V8 engine that the T100 was criticized for not having. However, the Tundra still came up short in towing capacity as well as still feeling slightly carlike. These concerns were addressed with an even larger 2007 redesign. A stronger V6 and a second V8 engine among other things were added to the option list. As of early 2010, the Tundra has captured 16% of the full-size half-ton market in the US.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The all-new Tundra was assembled in [[San Antonio, Texas]], US. Toyota assembled around 150,000 Standard and Double Cabs, and only 70,000 Crew Max's in 2007. The smaller Tacoma (which traces its roots back to the original Hilux) was also produced at the company's San Antonio facility.\n\nOutside the United States, Toyota produced the [[Toyota Hilux|Hilux]] in Standard and Double Cab, gasoline and diesel engine, and 2WD and 4WD versions. The BBC's ''Top Gear'' TV show featured two episodes of a Hilux that was deemed \"virtually indestructible\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series3episode5.shtml |title=Top Gear \u2013 Episode Archive \u2013 Series 3 |publisher=BBC |date=November 23, 2003 |accessdate=July 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106115656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series3episode5.shtml |archive-date=November 6, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Luxury-type vehicles====\n{{Further|List of Lexus vehicles}}\n[[File:2012 Toyota Crown-Royal 01.jpg|thumb|right|Toyota Crown Royal]]\n\nAs of 2009, the company sold nine luxury-branded models under its Lexus division, ranging from the [[Lexus LS|LS]] sedan to [[Lexus RX|RX]] crossover and [[Lexus LX|LX]] SUV.<ref name=Toyotaworld/> Luxury-type sedans produced under the Toyota brand included the [[Toyota Century|Century]], [[Toyota Crown|Crown]], and [[Toyota Crown Majesta|Crown Majesta]].<ref name=Toyotaworld/> A limited-edition model produced for the [[Emperor of Japan]] was the [[Toyota Century Royal|Century Royal]].

[[Pan American World Airways]] used [[Sikorsky S-38]] amphibians.

The [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] airplane was so severely damaged that it was shipped back to the [[United States|USA]]. On 16 April 1934 female aviator [[Laura Ingalls (aviator)|Laura Ingalls]] landed in a single engine airplane, the [[Lockheed Air Express]] at Zanderij in the first solo flight around [[South America]] in a landplane. The [[KLM]] tri-motor [[Fokker F.XVIII]], named the ''Snip'' (Snipe), made a trans-atlantic crossing from [[Amsterdam]] via [[Paramaribo]] to [[Cura\u00e7ao]], carrying mail. The trip of 12,200&nbsp;km (more than 4,000 over water) landed 8 days after take-off from [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Schiphol]], on 22 December 1934 at [[Cura\u00e7ao International Airport|Hato Airport]]. Captain was J.J. Hongdong, co-pilot/navigator J.J. van Balkom, engineer L.D. Stolk, wireless operator S. v.d. Molen.

However, the Snip flight did not inaugurate a regular KLM trans-Atlantic service. In January 1937 [[William Henry Vanderbilt III]] landed in a baby Clipper [[Sikorsky S-38]] at Zanderij with wife and friends [[George R. Hutchinson|The Flying Hutchinsons]].

[[Suriname]] was then the world's principal source of [[bauxite]] (for [[aluminium]] production) and needed protection. The first American armed forces arrived at the airport on 30 November 1941 and expanded the facilities to be a transport base for sending [[Lend-Lease]] supplies to [[England]] via air routes across the South [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The runways were constructed by the US Corps of Engineers. They also built the road from [[Onverwacht, Suriname|Onverwacht]] to Zanderij which was completed in 1942.\n\nWith the United States entry into the war in December 1941, the importance of Zandery Field increased drastically, becoming a major transport base on the South Atlantic route of [[Air Transport Command]] ferrying supplies and personnel to [[Lungi International Airport|Freetown Airport]], [[Sierra Leone]] and onwards to the European and African theaters of the war. In addition, antisubmarine patrols were flown from the airfield over the southern Caribbean and South Atlantic coastlines.\n\nMajor [[United States Army Air Forces|United States Army Air Force]] (USAAF) units assigned to the airfield were:\n* [[35th Bombardment Squadron]] ([[25th Attack Group|25th Bombardment Group]]) 1 November 1941 \u2013 7 October 1943 ([[B-25 Mitchell]])\n: Detachment operated from: [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport|Atkinson Field]], [[British Guiana]], 1 November 1942 \u2013 7 October 1943\n: Detachment operated from: [[Piarco International Airport|Piarco Airport]], [[Trinidad]], 27 August-12 October 1943\n* [[99th Reconnaissance Squadron|99th Bombardment Squadron]] ([[9th Bombardment Group]]), 3 December 1941 \u2013 31 October 1942 ([[Douglas B-18 Bolo|B-18 Bolo]])\n*[[22nd Fighter Squadron]] ([[36th Wing|36th Fighter Group]]), 16 September 1942 \u2013 16 February 1943 ([[Bell P-39 Airacobra|P-39]] Airacobras, later [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] Thunderbolts)\n*[[23rd Flying Training Squadron|23d Antisubmarine Squadron]] (Trinidad Detachment, [[Antilles Air Command]]), 15 August \u2013 December 1943 ([[A-29 Hudson]])\n\nJust before the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor attack]], on 3 December, the 99th Squadron was ordered to distant Zandery Field, [[Dutch Suriname|Dutch Guiana]] (by way of [[Piarco]] Field, Trinidad) under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in-exile, by which the [[United States]] occupied the colony to protect bauxite mines. However, to the disappointment of the crews, the squadron had to leave its [[B-17]] behind. It was, however, reinforced with additional [[Douglas B-18 Bolo|B-18A Bolos]], bringing squadron strength up to six aircraft. On 2 October 1942, a B-18A, piloted by Captain Howard Burhanna Jr. of the 99th Bomb Squadron, depth charged and sank the {{GS|U-512}} north of [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]].<ref>[http://uboat.net/boats/u512.htm \"B-18 sinks U-512.\"] ''uboat.net''. Retrieved: 17 May 2010.</ref>\n\nAt Zandery, the unit shuttled from Zandery to Atkinson Field, [[British Guiana]] and, by January 1942, had eight [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk variants|Curtiss P-40C Warhawks]] assigned. The P-40s were, in actuality, detached for airfield defense by the Trinidad Base Command, under which the 99th fell at the time.<ref>* {{cite web|first=William |last=Conaway |url= http://www.planesandpilotsofww2.totalh.net/panama/panama.htm |title=VI Bomber Command In Defense Of The Panama Canal 1941 - 45 |work=Planes and Pilots of World War Two}}</ref>\n\nThe intensive flying of the first two months of the war soon took its toll, however, and by the end of February 1942, the Squadron was forced to report that it had but three B-18As operational at Zandery and that \" ... none of them are airworthy at this time.\" Apparently the unit was quickly reinforced and by 1 March strength was back up to six aircraft, and seven combat crews, all of whom had more than 12 months' experience.\n\nOperations from Zandery Field consisted of coastal, convoy and anti-submarine patrols until 31 October 1942. Just prior to which time the 4th Antisubmarine Squadron was attached to the Squadron between 9 and 16 October. At this point Antisubmarine Command took over the mission of the 99th and the men and aircraft of the squadron were reassigned.\n\nIn the middle of World War II, on 2 November 1943, Her Royal Highness [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Princess Juliana]] visited Suriname from [[Canada]]. She landed at Zanderij with [[KLM]] airplane [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra]] PJ-AIM ''Meeuw'' as the first ever member of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch Royal Family]]. After the landing of the ''Meeuw'' and escorting Dutch and US military planes, the Royal Princess was welcomed by [[List of colonial governors of Suriname|governor Kielstra]] and inspected the [[guard of honour]].\n\nWith the end of World War II Zandery Airfield was reduced in scope to a skeleton staff. It was closed as a military facility on 30 April 1946. And on 22 October 1947 the Zandery Air Force Base was turned over to Dutch authorities which returned it to a civil airport. At that time the value of the facility was estimated to be 400,000 [[Surinamese guilder]]s (''S\u0192'').\n\n===Highlights in the years after the second World War===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Disembarking, Johan Pengel Airport.jpg|thumb|Passengers disembarking from a KLM airliner (foreground) at Johan Pengel Airport.

In June 1959 pilots and missionaries Robert Price and Eugene Friesen arrived at Zandery with a single engine plane during [[Operation Grasshopper]]. They performed many medical treatment work in the interior and the Sipaliwini savannah. On 3 March 1960 American president [[Dwight D.

They left Suriname the same day. On 14 April 1967 American president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] arrived during a rainstorm at Zanderij on board [[Air Force One]], a [[Boeing 707]] jet. Security was tight around Zanderij Airport. An agreement was signed by the Dutch government and the US to use Zanderij Airport for [[Military Airlift Command]] (MAC) usage. The USA paid US$22,000 for 400 landings per year. The crews stayed overnight at the [[Torarica Hotel]]. The [[North American X-15]] [[NASA]] [[rocket-powered aircraft]] was on exhibition at Zanderij Airport for an [[Airshow]] held from 8 to 13 November 1963. On 7 April 1972, the first-ever [[Boeing 747]] wide-body jetliner to land in South America, operated by [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]], landed at Zanderij Airport, Suriname.\n\nThe airport has officially been named after the popular Surinamese politician and former [[List of Prime Ministers of Suriname|Prime Minister of Suriname]] [[Johan Adolf Pengel]], but is locally still common named [[Zanderij]]. This is parallel to the small village and savannah where it is situated. The airport now has one runway of approximately 3.5&nbsp;km<ref name=\":0\" /> and reached an average of 500,000 passengers yearly in December 2019<ref>https://www.asi-mag.com/the-route-to-one-million-passengers-increasing-security-efforts-in-suriname/</ref>, mainly on transatlantic flights between Paramaribo and Amsterdam from [[KLM]], [[TUI fly Netherlands]] and [[Surinam Airways]] and some regional flights to Belem, Georgetown, Cayenne, Panama City and Miami by [[Copa Airlines]], [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos|Gol]] and Surinam Airways.

For the time being, the arrival lounge, commercial center and parking lot have been handed over, while the runway has been repaved, the platform for planes has been renovated, the runway lights on the arrival side have been replaced and a backup system for electricity has been installed as well. This was all done prior to the 30 August 2013 [[Union of South American Nations|UNASUR]] heads-of-state summit, hosted by Suriname. The project, which was prepared during the previous administration, is insufficient to actually turn the airport into an international hub. The departure and arrival lounges are currently apart from each other, but plans are to connect them in the future with airbridges. Lights were placed on the departure side of the runway, and the platform was expanded to accommodate more planes. The fire department barracks were moved to a more central location. Plans are to have the airbridges installed in the future, while the other matters were finished by 2017. The expansion of the airport will not only include the construction of a new terminal, but also the construction of a 2.7&nbsp;km taxiway that will run parallel to the long 3.5&nbsp;km runway. The total investment involves an amount of approximately US$205 million and approval for the loan agreement will be put forward to the National Assembly (DNA) of the Surinamese government by airport management mid-2019.<ref>http://unitednews.sr/27-kilometer-lange-taxibaan-voor-meer-en-snellere-afhandeling-vliegtuigen-jap-airport</ref>\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n===Passenger===\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Caribbean Airlines]] | [[Piarco International Airport|Port of Spain]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Copa Airlines]] | [[Tocumen International Airport|Panama City]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Fly All Ways]] | [[Ignacio Agramonte International Airport|Camaguey]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport|Havana]], [[Antonio Maceo Airport|Santiago de Cuba]] <br> '''Seasonal:''' [[Hato International Airport|Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Toussaint Louverture International Airport|Port-au-Prince]], [[Las Americas International Airport|Santo Domingo]], [[Princess Juliana International Airport|St. Maarten]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos]] | [[Val de Cans International Airport|Bel\u00e9m]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[KLM]] | [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Surinam Airways]] | [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]], [[Queen Beatrix International Airport|Aruba]], [[Val de Cans International Airport|Bel\u00e9m]], [[Hato International Airport|Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport|Georgetown\u2013Cheddi Jagan]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Piarco International Airport|Port of Spain]]<br> '''Seasonal:''' [[Orlando Sanford International Airport|Orlando/Sanford]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[TUI fly Netherlands]] | [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]]\n<!-- --> \n}}\n\n===Cargo===\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Amerijet International]] | [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport|Georgetown\u2013Cheddi Jagan]], [[Piarco International Airport|Port of Spain]], [[Grantley Adams International Airport|Bridgetown]], [[Robert L.

On 2 October 1942, a B-18A, piloted by Captain Howard Burhanna Jr. of the 99th Bomb Squadron, depth charged and sank the {{GS|U-512}} north of [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]].<ref>[http://uboat.net/boats/u512.htm \"B-18 sinks U-512.\"] ''uboat.net''.

The P-40s were, in actuality, detached for airfield defense by the Trinidad Base Command, under which the 99th fell at the time.<ref>* {{cite web|first=William |last=Conaway |url= http://www.planesandpilotsofww2.totalh.net/panama/panama.htm |title=VI Bomber Command In Defense Of The Panama Canal 1941 - 45 |work=Planes and Pilots of World War Two}}</ref>\n\nThe intensive flying of the first two months of the war soon took its toll, however, and by the end of February 1942, the Squadron was forced to report that it had but three B-18As operational at Zandery and that \" ... none of them are airworthy at this time.\" Apparently the unit was quickly reinforced and by 1 March strength was back up to six aircraft, and seven combat crews, all of whom had more than 12 months' experience.\n\nOperations from Zandery Field consisted of coastal, convoy and anti-submarine patrols until 31 October 1942. Just prior to which time the 4th Antisubmarine Squadron was attached to the Squadron between 9 and 16 October. At this point Antisubmarine Command took over the mission of the 99th and the men and aircraft of the squadron were reassigned.\n\nIn the middle of World War II, on 2 November 1943, Her Royal Highness [[Juliana of the Netherlands|Princess Juliana]] visited Suriname from [[Canada]]. She landed at Zanderij with [[KLM]] airplane [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra]] PJ-AIM ''Meeuw'' as the first ever member of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch Royal Family]]. After the landing of the ''Meeuw'' and escorting Dutch and US military planes, the Royal Princess was welcomed by [[List of colonial governors of Suriname|governor Kielstra]] and inspected the [[guard of honour]].\n\nWith the end of World War II Zandery Airfield was reduced in scope to a skeleton staff. It was closed as a military facility on 30 April 1946. And on 22 October 1947 the Zandery Air Force Base was turned over to Dutch authorities which returned it to a civil airport. At that time the value of the facility was estimated to be 400,000 [[Surinamese guilder]]s (''S\u0192'').\n\n===Highlights in the years after the second World War===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Disembarking, Johan Pengel Airport.jpg|thumb|Passengers disembarking from a KLM airliner (foreground) at Johan Pengel Airport.

In June 1959 pilots and missionaries Robert Price and Eugene Friesen arrived at Zandery with a single engine plane during [[Operation Grasshopper]]. They performed many medical treatment work in the interior and the Sipaliwini savannah. On 3 March 1960 American president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] landed at Zanderij on board [[Air Force One]] operated by the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] with a [[Boeing 707]] jetliner.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJAfjUOZiyI</ref> He was accompanied by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Christian Herter]]. They left Suriname the same day. On 14 April 1967 American president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] arrived during a rainstorm at Zanderij on board [[Air Force One]], a [[Boeing 707]] jet. Security was tight around Zanderij Airport. An agreement was signed by the Dutch government and the US to use Zanderij Airport for [[Military Airlift Command]] (MAC) usage. The USA paid US$22,000 for 400 landings per year. The crews stayed overnight at the [[Torarica Hotel]]. The [[North American X-15]] [[NASA]] [[rocket-powered aircraft]] was on exhibition at Zanderij Airport for an [[Airshow]] held from 8 to 13 November 1963. On 7 April 1972, the first-ever [[Boeing 747]] wide-body jetliner to land in South America, operated by [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]], landed at Zanderij Airport, Suriname.\n\nThe airport has officially been named after the popular Surinamese politician and former [[List of Prime Ministers of Suriname|Prime Minister of Suriname]] [[Johan Adolf Pengel]], but is locally still common named [[Zanderij]]. This is parallel to the small village and savannah where it is situated. The airport now has one runway of approximately 3.5&nbsp;km<ref name=\":0\" /> and sees an average of 100,000 passengers yearly, mainly on transatlantic flights between Paramaribo and Amsterdam from [[KLM]] and [[Surinam Airways]] and some regional flights to Belem, Georgetown, Cayenne, Miami and the Caribbean, also with [[Caribbean Airlines]] and [[Insel Air]], besides Surinam Airways.\n\n===Future===\nThe state will invest an extra US$70 million in expanding and modernizing the J.A.

For the time being, the arrival lounge, commercial center and parking lot have been handed over, while the runway has been repaved, the platform for planes has been renovated, the runway lights on the arrival side have been replaced and a backup system for electricity has been installed as well. This was all done prior to the 30 August 2013 [[Union of South American Nations|UNASUR]] heads-of-state summit, hosted by Suriname. The project, which was prepared during the previous administration, is insufficient to actually turn the airport into an international hub. The departure and arrival lounges are currently apart from each other, but plans are to connect them in the future with airbridges. Lights were placed on the departure side of the runway, and the platform was expanded to accommodate more planes. The fire department barracks were moved to a more central location. Plans are to have the airbridges installed in the future, while the other matters were finished by 2017. The expansion of the airport will not only include the construction of a new terminal, but also the construction of a 2.7&nbsp;km taxiway that will run parallel to the long 3.5&nbsp;km runway. The total investment involves an amount of approximately US$205 million and approval for the loan agreement will be put forward to the National Assembly (DNA) of the Surinamese government by airport management mid-2019.<ref>http://unitednews.sr/27-kilometer-lange-taxibaan-voor-meer-en-snellere-afhandeling-vliegtuigen-jap-airport</ref>\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n===Passenger===\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Caribbean Airlines]] | [[Piarco International Airport|Port of Spain]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Copa Airlines]] | [[Tocumen International Airport|Panama City]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Fly All Ways]] | [[Ignacio Agramonte International Airport|Camaguey]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport|Havana]], [[Antonio Maceo Airport|Santiago de Cuba]] <br> '''Seasonal:''' [[Hato International Airport|Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Toussaint Louverture International Airport|Port-au-Prince]], [[Las Americas International Airport|Santo Domingo]], [[Princess Juliana International Airport|St. Maarten]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos]] | [[Val de Cans International Airport|Bel\u00e9m]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[KLM]] | [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Surinam Airways]] | [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]], [[Queen Beatrix International Airport|Aruba]], [[Val de Cans International Airport|Bel\u00e9m]], [[Hato International Airport|Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport|Georgetown\u2013Cheddi Jagan]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Piarco International Airport|Port of Spain]]<br> '''Seasonal:''' [[Orlando Sanford International Airport|Orlando/Sanford]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[TUI fly Netherlands]] | [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]]\n<!-- --> \n}}\n\n===Cargo===\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Amerijet International]] | [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Cheddi Jagan International Airport|Georgetown\u2013Cheddi Jagan]], [[Piarco International Airport|Port of Spain]], [[Grantley Adams International Airport|Bridgetown]], [[Robert L.

It is located in [[Kalaw Township]] which is part of [[Taunggyi District]].\nIt lies on the [[Thazi, Meiktila, Mandalay Region|Thazi]]-[[Kengtung|Kyaingtong]] road at an elevation of 4219 feet (1286 meters) above sea level.\n\nAs of September 2014, its population was recorded 30,313.\nIt is a junction town in the midst of agricultural villages and thus the majority of agricultural products (mainly potato, garlic, ginger, cabbage, tomato, cauliflower, avocado, orange, tea-leaves) from nearby towns and villages are all collected thereby traders and distributed to other parts of the country, especially to [[Yangon]], [[Mandalay]], [[Karen State|Kayin]] and [[Mon State|Mon]].\n\nThe single-line railway line was extended from Aungpan to [[Shwenyaung]], in the 1920s and [[Heho]], a small village of [[Danu people]] grew into a town. [[Heho]] was determined to be a convenient intermediate stop and transfer point. Later an [[Heho Airport|airport]] was built, {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the town. The [[airport]] served as an airbase both for the Allies and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] during [[World War II]] and it was heavily bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Evidence of aircraft bunker revetments and bomb craters can still be seen on the southern end of the airfield, especially noticeable from the air.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nAs a trade hub in the region, more than a dozen banks are being operated. Being a logistically important place, most of the biggest companies in the country set up branch offices there, creating many employment opportunities for local people. Job opportunities vary from porters and lorry-drivers to mid-level management officers.\n\nThe town also plays a strategic role in military works that it has become an army base. The Seven-hundred bedded military hospital started its operation in the 2000s, providing healthcare service not only to military personnel but also to the wider public.\n\nRecent Town Committee's permit to set Aungpan's [[Pindaya]] exit road as an entertainment zone let KTVs mushroom along the road, forming as an only red-light district in the region.\nPin-hmi golf range which is located near the southern exit of the town is getting popular among local golfers and always crowded on weekends. Special tournaments are often held by the club, which is commonly sponsored by [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]].\n\nThe Aungpan-[[Loikaw]] railroad was constructed in 1992. The condition of motorway from Aungpan to [[Loikaw]] was significantly improved over the past few years and local people no longer rely on train services nowadays.\n\nA recent boom in the tourism industry of [[Kalaw]] as a popular hiking spot and hill station has brought some impact to Aungpan as well. There are more than five hotels offering hundreds of rooms to visitors.\n\nDespite earning many municipal taxes from local businesses and people, township administrative parties were focusing mainly on [[Kalaw]] that the town grew double in size without proper city planning. There are no public amenities for the population and the private business sector starts to take chance by developing swimming pools, playground, football pitches, etc. around the town.\nThere is a small lake, named '''Mingalar Lake''' in '''Bahtoo Park'''. Once it was a collection of drain water discharged from living quarters. Renovation and restoration work for the park and the lake was carried out by the chairman of [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]] and now it becomes a recreational place for the locals.\n\nThe motorway passing through '''Aungpan''' is upgraded to four-lane recently. Consequently, buildings fall under motorway's zoning undergone demolition. Captain Ba Htoo's (one of the most famous leaders during Burma's Independence Movement during the colonial period) Memorial Monument was destroyed and to be built back near the original place. Controversial and criticisms arose around the country for complete demolishment without considering for relocation. The construction of the Monument was completed and to be opened on March 27th, 2020. However, the opening ceremony was canceled due to the outbreak of '''Coronavirus disease 2019''' ('''COVID-19'''), an [[infectious disease]] caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] in the country on March 23rd, 2020 reported by MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SPORTS<ref>https://www.mohs.gov.mm/</ref> |.\nThe town's 100-years-anniversary clock-tower at the [[Pindaya]] junction was removed as well.\nMotorway upgrade was done in April 2020 and now the town gets a newer look.\nHowever, the common use of motorway for the town's own traffic and speedy expressway vehicles is likely to lead accidents unless proper traffic regulation and enforcement are practiced.\n\n== Climate ==\nAungpan has a Dry-winter humid [[subtropical climate]] (''Cwa''), closely bordering a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwb'') according to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].\n''Cwa'' is monsoonal influenced, having the classic dry winter \u2013 wet summer pattern associated with tropical monsoonal climates.\n\nThe weather is usually warm and temperate. When compared with winter, the summers have much more rainfall.\nThe average annual temperature in Aungpan is 19.1 \u00b0C (66.3 \u00b0F).\nThe warmest month of the year is April, with an average temperature of 22.7 \u00b0C (72.9 \u00b0F).

The aim is to \"expose students to their specialized crop and do more research in order to become crop specialists\". The undergraduate students come to Aungpan branch to study and do research on maize and cereals.\nThe Seven-hundred bed military hospital also serves as a teaching hospital for Defence Service Medical Academy's house surgeons from [[Yangon]].

It was founded on July 20th, 2005 \u2013 the full moon day of [[Waso]], (1367 in the [[Myanmar]] calendar). Its name literally means \u201cVictory and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nLeading the project is U Pyinnya Wunsa (68 years old), the abbot of Aungchanthar monastery and a member of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, locally known as Aungchanthar Sayadaw.\n\n[[File: Aung Chan Thar Pagoda2.jpg|thumb|left|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n\nThere is still a lot of work to do until the Pagoda is complete.\nHe decided to build the Pagoda because '''Aungpan''' is at the center of several famous places in the region, such as [[Inle Lake]] and [[Pindaya Caves|Pindaya]], and visitors frequently ask him why the town doesn't have any sacred pagoda.\n\nIt has been under construction for about fifteen years. It had been spent about [[Kyat]] six billion (about [[US$]] 6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about [[Kyat]] 7.6 billion.\n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project. Now the project is moving much faster.\n\n[[File:Interior structure of pagoda.jpg|thumb|right|The interior structure of pagoda. (February, 2020)]]\n\nWhen completed, the pagoda will be encircled by 107 smaller stupas, ranging in height from 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 12 feet (3.6 meters).\nWhile Aungchanthar Pagoda will replicate [[Shwedagon Pagoda]], it will also incorporate a hollow interior.\n\n== Aunpan's 100th year Anniversary ==\n\n2013 marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the town. The locals celebrated the town's 100th anniversary with many celebrations. The town's 100-years-anniversary clock-tower was also built at the [[Pindaya]] junction. The tower was removed in 2019 due to the upgrading of the [[Thazi, Meiktila, Mandalay Region|Thazi]]-[[Kengtung|Kyaingtong]] four-lane road and to be rebuilt in the same place by the construction company.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.maplandia.com/burma/shan/kalaw/aungban/ Satellite map at Maplandia.com]\n\n{{Kalaw Township}}\n{{Shan State}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Taunggyi District]]\n[[Category:Kalaw Township]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| native_name = {{my|\u1021\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1015\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1019\u103c\u102d\u102f\u1037}}\n| official_name = Aungpan\n|image_skyline = Aungban.jpg\n|image_map =\n|subdivision_type = Country\n|subdivision_name = {{Flag|Myanmar}}\n|subdivision_type1 = [[Administrative divisions of Burma|State]]\n|subdivision_name1 = {{flag|Shan State}}\n|subdivision_type2 = [[Districts of Burma|Districts]]\n|subdivision_name2 = [[Taunggyi District]]\n|subdivision_type3 = Township\n|subdivision_name3 = [[Kalaw Township]]\n|unit_pref = Imperial\n|area_total_km2 =\n|population =\n|population_as_of = 2014\n|population_blank1 = [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Danu people|Danu]], [[Bamar]], [[Pa-O]], [[Taungyo]], [[Burmese Chinese]], [[Burmese Indians]], [[Burmese Gurkha|Gurkha]]\n|population_blank1_title = Ethnicities\n|population_blank2 = [[Theravada Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]]\n|population_blank2_title = Religions\n|population_density_km2 = auto\n|population_total = 30,313\n| map_caption =\n| pushpin_map = Myanmar#Asia\n| pushpin_label_position = bottom\n| pushpin_map_caption = Location of Aungpan, Myanmar\n| coordinates = {{coord|20|40|0|N|96|38|0|E|type:town_region:MM|display=inline,title}}\n|leader_title = Mayor\n|established_date = 1913\n|established_title = Founded\n|elevation_ft = 4219\n|elevation_m = 1286\n|timezone = [[Time in Burma|MST]]\n|utc_offset = +6.30\n|area_code = 081<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://en.18dao.net/Area_Code/Myanmar | title=Myanmar Area Codes | accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref>\n|postal_code_type = [[Postal code]]<ref>http://www.myanmaposts.net.mm/</ref>\n|postal_code = 06022\n|registration_plate = SHN\n| blank_name_sec1 = [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Climate]]\n| blank_info_sec1 = [[Humid subtropical]] (Cwa)\n|website =\n}}\n\n'''Aungpan''' ({{lang-my|\u1021\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1015\u1014\u103a\u1038\u1019\u103c\u102d\u102f\u1037}}) is a town located in the Southern [[Shan State]]. It is located in [[Kalaw Township]] which is part of [[Taunggyi District]].\nIt lies on the [[Thazi, Meiktila, Mandalay Region|Thazi]]-[[Kengtung|Kyaingtong]] road at an elevation of 4219 feet (1286 meters) above sea level.\n\nAs of September 2014, its population was recorded 30,313.\nIt is a junction town in the midst of agricultural villages and thus the majority of agricultural products (mainly potato, garlic, ginger, cabbage, tomato, cauliflower, avocado, orange, tea-leaves) from nearby towns and villages are all collected thereby traders and distributed to other parts of the country, especially to [[Yangon]], [[Mandalay]], [[Karen State|Kayin]] and [[Mon State|Mon]].\n\nThe single-line railway line was extended from Aungpan to [[Shwenyaung]], in the 1920s and [[Heho]], a small village of [[Danu people]] grew into a town. [[Heho]] was determined to be a convenient intermediate stop and transfer point. Later an [[Heho Airport|airport]] was built, {{convert|4|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the town. The [[airport]] served as an airbase both for the Allies and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] during [[World War II]] and it was heavily bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Evidence of aircraft bunker revetments and bomb craters can still be seen on the southern end of the airfield, especially noticeable from the air.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nAs a trade hub in the region, more than half a dozen banks are being operated. As a logistically important place, most of the biggest companies in the country set up branch offices there, creating many employment opportunities for local people. Job opportunities vary from porters and lorry-drivers to mid-level management officers.\n\nThe town also plays a strategic role in military works that it has become an army base. The Seven-hundred bedded military hospital started its operation in the 2000s, providing healthcare service not only to military personnel but also to the wider public.\n\nRecent Town Committee's permit to set Aungpan's [[Pindaya]] exit road as an entertainment zone let KTVs mushroom along the road, forming as an only red-light district in the region.\nPin-hmi golf range which is located near the southern exit of the town is getting popular among local golfers and always crowded on weekends. Special tournaments are often held by the club, which is commonly sponsored by [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]].\n\nThe Aungpan-[[Loikaw]] railroad was constructed in 1992. The condition of motorway from Aungpan to [[Loikaw]] was significantly improved over the past few years and local people no longer rely on train services nowadays.\n\nA recent boom in the tourism industry of [[Kalaw]] as a popular hiking spot and hill station has brought some impact to Aungpan as well. There are more than five hotels offering hundreds of rooms to visitors.\n\nDespite earning many municipal taxes from local businesses and people, township administrative parties were focusing mainly on [[Kalaw]] that the town grew double in size without proper city planning. There are no public amenities for the population and the private business sector starts to take chance by developing swimming pools, playground, football pitches, etc. around the town.\nThere is a small lake, named '''Mingalar Lake''' in '''Bahtoo Park'''. Once it was a collection of drain water discharged from living quarters. Renovation and restoration work for the park and the lake was carried out by the chairman of [[Kanbawza Bank|KBZ Bank]] and now it becomes a recreational place for the locals.\n\nThe motorway passing through '''Aungpan''' is upgraded to four-lane recently. Consequently, buildings fall under motorway's zoning undergone demolition. Captain Ba Htoo's (one of the most famous leaders during Burma's Independence Movement during the colonial period) Memorial Monument was destroyed and to be built back near the original place. Controversial and criticisms arose around the country for complete demolishment without considering for relocation. The construction of the Monument was completed and to be opened on March 27th, 2020. However, the opening ceremony was canceled due to the outbreak of '''Coronavirus disease 2019''' ('''COVID-19'''), an [[infectious disease]] caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] in the country on March 23rd, 2020 reported by MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SPORTS<ref>https://www.mohs.gov.mm/</ref> |.\nThe town's 100-years-anniversary clock-tower at the [[Pindaya]] junction was removed as well.\nUpgrade will be finished by April 2020 and now the town gets a newer look.\nHowever, the common use of motorway for the town's own traffic and speedy expressway vehicles is likely to lead accidents unless proper traffic regulation and enforcement are practiced.\n\n== Climate ==\nAungpan has a Dry-winter humid [[subtropical climate]] (''Cwa''), closely bordering a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwb'') according to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].\n''Cwa'' is monsoonal influenced, having the classic dry winter \u2013 wet summer pattern associated with tropical monsoonal climates.\n\nThe weather is usually warm and temperate. When compared with winter, the summers have much more rainfall.\nThe average annual temperature in Aungpan is 19.1 \u00b0C (66.3 \u00b0F).\nThe warmest month of the year is April, with an average temperature of 22.7 \u00b0C (72.9 \u00b0F).

This usage could apply to women too. The British comic strip ''[[Jane (comic strip)|Jane]]'', first published in the 1930s, described the adventures of ''Jane Gay''. Far from implying homosexuality, it referred to her free-wheeling lifestyle with plenty of boyfriends (while also punning on [[Lady Jane Grey]]).\n\nA passage from [[Gertrude Stein]]'s ''Miss Furr & Miss Skeene'' (1922) is possibly the first traceable published use of the word to refer to a homosexual relationship. According to Linda Wagner-Martin (''Favored Strangers: Gertrude Stein and her Family'', 1995) the portrait \"featured the sly repetition of the word gay, used with sexual intent for one of the first times in linguistic history,\" and [[Edmund Wilson]] (1951, quoted by James Mellow in ''Charmed Circle'', 1974) agreed.<ref>Martha E.

In a scene in which [[Cary Grant]]'s character's clothes have been sent to the cleaners, he is forced to wear a woman's feather-trimmed robe. When another character asks about his robe, he responds, \"Because I just went ''gay'' all of a sudden!\" Since this was a mainstream film at a time, when the use of the word to refer to [[cross-dressing]] (and, by extension, homosexuality) would still be unfamiliar to most film-goers, the line can also be interpreted to mean, \"I just decided to do something frivolous.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG03/comedy/bringingupbaby.html|title=Bringing Up Baby|access-date=24 November 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630103200/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG03/comedy/bringingupbaby.html|archive-date=30 June 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, the earliest reference found to date for the word gay as a self-described name for homosexuals came from Alfred A.

Additionally, none of the words describing any aspect of homosexuality were considered suitable for polite society. Consequently, a number of [[euphemism]]s were used to hint at suspected homosexuality. Examples include \"sporty\" girls and \"artistic\" boys,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cocks |first1=H.

He begins, \"I'd like to propose...\" at which point a fellow diner, played by [[Sidney Tafler]], interjects \"Who to?\", suggesting a proposal of marriage.

So, organizations like the National Gay Task Force became the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]]. For many ardent feminist lesbians, it was also important that the ''L'' come first, lest an ''L'' following a ''G'' become another symbol of male dominance over women,<ref>''Lesbian Ethics'', pp. 13\u201321.</ref> although other women prefer the usage ''gay woman''. In the 1990s, this was followed by another equally concerted push to include the terminology specifically pointing out the inclusion of bisexual, [[transgender]], [[intersex]], and other people, reflecting the intra-community debate as to whether these other sexual minorities were part of the same human rights movement. Most news organizations have formally adopted variations of this use, following the example and preference of the organizations, as reflected in their press releases and public communications.\n\n=== Descriptor ===\n[[File:Seattle R Place.jpg|thumb|right| \"R Place\" [[Gay Bar]] in [[Seattle]], Washington, United States.]]\n\nThe term ''gay'' can also be used as an adjective to describe things related to homosexual men, or things which are part of [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|the said culture]]. For example, the term \"gay bar\" describes the bar which either caters primarily to a homosexual male clientele or is otherwise part of homosexual male culture.\n\nUsing it to describe an object, such as an item of clothing, suggests that it is particularly flamboyant, often on the verge of being gaudy and garish. This usage predates the association of the term with homosexuality but has acquired different connotations since the modern usage developed.\n\n{{anchor|noun|Noun}}\n\n=== Use as a noun ===\nThe label ''gay'' was originally used purely as an [[adjective]] (\"he is a gay man\" or \"he is gay\"). The term has also been in use as a [[noun]] with the meaning \"homosexual man\" since the 1970s, most commonly in the plural for an unspecified group, as in \"gays are opposed to that policy.\" This usage is somewhat common in the names of organizations such as [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays]] (PFLAG) and [[Children of lesbians and gays everywhere|Children of Lesbians And Gays Everywhere]] (COLAGE). It is sometimes used to refer to individuals, as in \"he is a gay\" or \"two gays were there too,\" although this may be perceived as derogatory.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Editors of the American Heritage Dictionaries|title=The American Heritage Book of English Usage|date=1996|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0547563213|page=197|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=BEHFyMCdwssC&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197|accessdate=30 July 2016|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012014626/https://books.google.de/books?id=BEHFyMCdwssC&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197|archive-date=12 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also used for comedic effect by the ''[[Little Britain]]'' character Dafydd Thomas.\n\n==Generalized pejorative use==\nWhen used with a derisive attitude (e.g., \"that was so gay\"), the word ''gay'' is [[pejorative]].

This usage could apply to women too. The British comic strip ''[[Jane (comic strip)|Jane]]'', first published in the 1930s, described the adventures of ''Jane Gay''. Far from implying homosexuality, it referred to her free-wheeling lifestyle with plenty of boyfriends (while also punning on [[Lady Jane Grey]]).\n\nA passage from [[Gertrude Stein]]'s ''Miss Furr & Miss Skeene'' (1922) is possibly the first traceable published use of the word to refer to a homosexual relationship. According to Linda Wagner-Martin (''Favored Strangers: Gertrude Stein and her Family'', 1995) the portrait \"featured the sly repetition of the word gay, used with sexual intent for one of the first times in linguistic history,\" and [[Edmund Wilson]] (1951, quoted by James Mellow in ''Charmed Circle'', 1974) agreed.<ref>Martha E.

In a scene in which [[Cary Grant]]'s character's clothes have been sent to the cleaners, he is forced to wear a woman's feather-trimmed robe. When another character asks about his robe, he responds, \"Because I just went ''gay'' all of a sudden!\" Since this was a mainstream film at a time, when the use of the word to refer to [[cross-dressing]] (and, by extension, homosexuality) would still be unfamiliar to most film-goers, the line can also be interpreted to mean, \"I just decided to do something frivolous.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG03/comedy/bringingupbaby.html|title=Bringing Up Baby|access-date=24 November 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630103200/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG03/comedy/bringingupbaby.html|archive-date=30 June 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, the earliest reference found to date for the word gay as a self-described name for homosexuals came from Alfred A.

Additionally, none of the words describing any aspect of homosexuality were considered suitable for polite society. Consequently, a number of [[euphemism]]s were used to hint at suspected homosexuality. Examples include \"sporty\" girls and \"artistic\" boys,<ref>Cocks, H. A. \"'Sporty' Girls and 'Artistic' Boys: Friendship, Illicit Sex, and the British 'Companionship' Advertisement, 1913\u20131928\", ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' \u2013 Volume 11, Number 3, July 2002, pp. 457\u2013482.</ref> all with the stress deliberately on the otherwise completely innocent adjective.\n\nThe 1960s marked the transition in the predominant meaning of the word ''gay'' from that of \"carefree\" to the current \"homosexual\". In the British comedy-drama film ''[[Light Up the Sky! (film)|Light Up the Sky!]]'' (1960), directed by [[Lewis Gilbert]], about the antics of a British Army searchlight squad during World War II, there is a scene in the mess hut where the character played by [[Benny Hill]] proposes an after-dinner toast. He begins, \"I'd like to propose...\" at which point a fellow diner, played by [[Sidney Tafler]], interjects \"Who to?\", suggesting a proposal of marriage. The Benny Hill character responds, \"Not to you for start, you ain't my type\". He then adds in mock doubt, \"Oh, I don't know, you're rather gay on the quiet.\"\n\nBy 1963, a new sense of the word ''gay'' was known well enough to be used by [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] in his book ''The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Man-Hunting''. Similarly, [[Hubert Selby, Jr.]] in his 1964 novel ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn]]'', could write that a character \"took pride in being a homosexual by feeling intellectually and esthetically superior to those (especially women) who weren't gay....\"<ref>Selby, Jr., Hubert \"Last Exit To Brooklyn\" NY: Grove Press, 1988 p. 23 copyright 1964</ref> Later examples of the original meaning of the word being used in popular culture include the theme song to the 1960\u20131966 animated TV series ''[[The Flintstones]]'', whereby viewers are assured that they will \"have a gay old time.\" Similarly, the 1966 [[Herman's Hermits]] song \"[[No Milk Today]]\", which became a Top 10 hit in the UK and a [[Top 40]] hit in the U.S., included the lyric \"No milk today, it was not always so; ''The company was gay'', we'd turn night into day.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/paul/lyrics/hermanshermits/nomilk~1.html|title=The Lyrics Library \u2013 Herman's Hermits \u2013 No Milk Today|access-date=24 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205130619/http://www.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/paul/lyrics/hermanshermits/nomilk~1.html|archive-date=5 December 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1967, the headline of the review of the Beatles' ''[[Sgt.

So, organizations like the National Gay Task Force became the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]]. For many ardent feminist lesbians, it was also important that the ''L'' come first, lest an ''L'' following a ''G'' become another symbol of male dominance over women,<ref>''Lesbian Ethics'', pp. 13\u201321.</ref> although other women prefer the usage ''gay woman''. In the 1990s, this was followed by another equally concerted push to include the terminology specifically pointing out the inclusion of bisexual, [[transgender]], [[intersex]], and other people, reflecting the intra-community debate as to whether these other sexual minorities were part of the same human rights movement. Most news organizations have formally adopted variations of this use, following the example and preference of the organizations, as reflected in their press releases and public communications.\n\n=== Descriptor ===\n[[File:Seattle R Place.jpg|thumb|right| \"R Place\" [[Gay Bar]] in [[Seattle]], Washington, United States.]]\n\nThe term ''gay'' can also be used as an adjective to describe things related to homosexual men, or things which are part of [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|the said culture]]. For example, the term \"gay bar\" describes the bar which either caters primarily to a homosexual male clientele or is otherwise part of homosexual male culture.\n\nUsing it to describe an object, such as an item of clothing, suggests that it is particularly flamboyant, often on the verge of being gaudy and garish. This usage predates the association of the term with homosexuality but has acquired different connotations since the modern usage developed.\n\n{{anchor|noun|Noun}}\n\n=== Use as a noun ===\nThe label ''gay'' was originally used purely as an [[adjective]] (\"he is a gay man\" or \"he is gay\"). The term has also been in use as a [[noun]] with the meaning \"homosexual man\" since the 1970s, most commonly in the plural for an unspecified group, as in \"gays are opposed to that policy.\" This usage is somewhat common in the names of organizations such as [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays]] (PFLAG) and [[Children of lesbians and gays everywhere|Children of Lesbians And Gays Everywhere]] (COLAGE). It is sometimes used to refer to individuals, as in \"he is a gay\" or \"two gays were there too,\" although this may be perceived as derogatory.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Editors of the American Heritage Dictionaries|title=The American Heritage Book of English Usage|date=1996|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0547563213|page=197|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=BEHFyMCdwssC&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197|accessdate=30 July 2016|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012014626/https://books.google.de/books?id=BEHFyMCdwssC&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197|archive-date=12 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also used for comedic effect by the ''[[Little Britain]]'' character Dafydd Thomas.\n\n==Generalized pejorative use==\nWhen used with a derisive attitude (e.g., \"that was so gay\"), the word ''gay'' is [[pejorative]].

It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Many companies===\n[[File:Zuercher Strassenbahnlinien um 1899.jpg|thumb|The mix of routes in 1899, distinguishing city owned (''Stadt'') and private (''Privat''), and horse (''Pferdebahn'') and electric (''elektrisch'')]]\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles.

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]]. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles. The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids. As of February 2015, no decision had been made as to which supplier to select, with reports of conflict between city and canton authorities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=210610a | title = Tango, Combino or Flexity? | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = June 2010 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=201112 | title = New tram order: The ball is rolling | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = November 2012 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2013&item=080413 | title = Five suppliers vie for tram contract | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = April 2013 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2015&item=260215 | title = More gloom over tram order | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = February 2015 | accessdate = 2015-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, it was announced that VBZ had awarded a contract worth 358 million [[Swiss Franc]]s to [[Bombardier Transportation]] for the supply of 70 7-section [[Flexity 2]] trams, with an option for a further 70, to be delivered between 2018 and 2023. The new trams will be {{convert|43|m}} long and {{convert|2.4|m}} wide, and be capable of carrying 90 seated and 186 standing passengers. Both [[Stadler Rail]] and [[Siemens]] filed complaints with the [[Administrative Court of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich]], causing the finalisation of the contract to be suspended, but the court ruled in February 2017 that VBZ could conclude the contract with Bombardier. After both Stadler and Siemens decided not to appeal this decision to the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]], the contract was finally signed on 2 March 2017.

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Many companies===\n[[File:Zuercher Strassenbahnlinien um 1899.jpg|thumb|The mix of routes in 1899, distinguishing city owned (''Stadt'') and private (''Privat''), and horse (''Pferdebahn'') and electric (''elektrisch'')]]\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles.

In the city centre the tram tracks run through largely pedestrianised streets, and in one place in the suburbs the trams use a tunnel originally constructed for the never completed [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system.

Z\u00fcrich's trams are single-ended, with doors on only one side, although Forchbahn trains are double-ended and double-sided.

All tram stops are equipped with ticket machines, and passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding the vehicle.

Instead, tickets are randomly checked by roving teams of fare inspectors, and fines are imposed on passengers found without one.<ref name=vbzatm>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Automatic ticket machine | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nTram services are operated within the fare and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich]] and thus covers travel on other modes and services, provided by many other operators, and includes the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] suburban rail network.

The Z\u00fcrich tram network extends over just two of these zones, with zone 110 covering the city routes, and zone 121 covering the Stadtbahn Glattal routes.

Small [[microcontinents]] and oceanic islands collided with and sutured onto  the ever-growing Laurentia, and together formed the stable [[Precambrian]] craton seen today.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dalziel |first=I.W.D. |year=1992 |title=On the organization of American Plates in the Neoproterozoic and the breakout of Laurentia |work=GSA Today |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=237\u2013241}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hoffman |first=Paul F. |year=1988 |title=United Plates of America, The Birth of a Craton: Early Proterozoic Assembly and Growth of Laurentia |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=16 |pages=543\u2013603 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.16.050188.002551|bibcode=1988AREPS..16..543H }}</ref>\n\nThe craton is named after the [[Laurentian Shield]], through the [[Laurentian Mountains]], which received their name from the [[Saint Lawrence River]], named after [[Lawrence of Rome]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Graham |first=Joseph |year=2005 |chapter=The Laurentians |title=Naming the Laurentians: A History of Place Names 'up North' |page=15 }}</ref>\n\n==Interior platform==\nIn eastern and central Canada, much of the stable craton is exposed at the surface as the [[Canadian Shield]]; when subsurface extensions are considered, the wider term [[Laurentian Shield]] is more common, not least because large parts of the structure extend outside Canada.

During much of [[Mississippian (geology)|Mississippian]] time, the craton was the site of an extensive marine carbonate platform on which mainly limestones and some [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]]s and evaporites were deposited. This platform extended from either the present [[Appalachian Mountains]] or [[Mississippi Valley]] to the present [[Great Basin]]. The craton was covered by shallow, warm, tropical epicontinental or [[epicratonic sea]] (meaning literally \"on the craton\") that had maximum depths of only about 60&nbsp;m (200&nbsp;ft) at the shelf edge. During [[Cretaceous]] times, such a sea, the [[Western Interior Seaway]], ran from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the [[Arctic Ocean]], dividing North America into eastern and western land masses.
