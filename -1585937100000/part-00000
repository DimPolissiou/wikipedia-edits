In the north, in what is now Eritrea, Ethiopia managed to repulse [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman conquest of Habesh|invasion]] attempts, although losing its access to the [[Red Sea]] to them.\n\nReacting to these challenges, Ethiopia started to expand westwards, conquering the [[Lake Tana]] area and much of [[Beta Israel]] territory in [[Begemder]]. In the 1630s Emperor [[Fasilides]] founded the new capital of [[Gondar]], marking the start for a new golden age known as \"Gondarine period\". It saw a relative peace, the successful integration of the Oromo and a flourishing of culture. With the deaths of Emperor [[Iyasu II]] (1755) and especially [[Iyoas I]] (1769) the realm eventually entered a period of decentralization, known as [[Zemene Mesafint|\"Era of the Princes\"]]. The [[Shewa]] region factually seceded and constituted a kingdom of its own, while within the Empire, regional warlords contested for power, with the Emperor being barely more than a mere puppet.\n\nEmperor [[Tewodros II]] (r. 1855\u20131868) put an end into that state, reunified the Empire and led it into the modern period before dying during the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]]. His successor [[Yohannes IV]] engaged primarily in war and successfully fought [[Ethiopian-Egyptian War|the Egyptians]] and the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdists]] before dying against the latter in the [[Battle of Gallabat]] in 1889. Emperor [[Menelik II]], now residing in the recently founded town of [[Addis Abeba]], continued and concluded the policy of expansion of his predecessor, subjugating many people and kingdoms in what is now western, southern and eastern Ethiopia, like [[Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa]], [[Welayta people#History|Wolaytta]] or [[Aussa Sultanate|Aussa]]. Thus, he gave Ethiopia the geographical extent it has today. In the north he was confronted with an expanding [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Decisively defeating it at the [[Battle of Adwa]] in 1896 with the aid of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and France, Menelik ensured Ethiopia's independence and [[Italian Eritrea|confined Italy to Eritrea]].\n\nLater, after the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], the [[Italian Empire]] occupied Ethiopia and established the [[Italian East Africa]] colony in the region. After World War II, the Italians were driven out with the help of the British army. The country was one of the founding members of the [[United Nations]], and in 1962 annexed Eritrea. However, the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] led to the [[Eritrean War of Independence|independence of Eritrea]] and fall of the Empire in 1974.\n\nBy 1974, Ethiopia was one of only three countries in the world to have the title of [[Emperor]] for its head of state, together with [[Japan]] and [[Iran]] under the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. It was the second-to-last country in Africa to use the title of Emperor; the only one later was the [[Central African Empire]], which was implemented between 1976 and 1979 by [[Emperor of Central Africa|Emperor]] [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa|Bokassa I]].\n\n==History==\n===D'mt and Kingdom of Aksum===\n{{Main|D\u02bfmt|Kingdom of Aksum}}\n[[File:Axumite Jar Spout (2822628227).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Kingdom of Aksum]] jar spout]]\nEthiopia's human occupation began early, as evidenced by the findings{{Which|date=July 2018}}.

They would be one of the major factions contending for imperial power during the ensuing [[Zemene Mesafint]], starting from 1769, when [[Mikael Sehul]], [[Ras (title)|Ras]] of [[Tigray Region|Tigray]] killed [[Iyoas I]] and replaced him with [[Yohannes II]].\n\nThe Early Modern period was one of intense cultural and artistic creation. Notable philosophers from that area are [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]] and [[Walda Heywat]]. The city of Gondar became the capital in 1636, with several [[Fortification|fortified castles]] built in the town and in its surrounding areas.\n\n===Princes' Era===\n{{Main|Zemene Mesafint}}\n[[File:T\u00e9wodros II.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Tewodros II]]'s rise to the throne marked the end of the ''[[Zemene Mesafint]]''.]]\nFrom 1769 to 1855, the Ethiopian empire passed through a period known as the ''Princes Era'' (in Amharic ''Zemene Mesafint''). This was a period of Ethiopian history with numerous conflicts between the various [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Ras|ras]] (equivalent to the English [[duke]]s) and the emperor, who had only limited power and only dominated the area around the contemporary capital of [[Gondar]]. Both the development of society and culture stagnated in this period. Religious conflict, both within the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] and between them and the Muslims were often used as a pretext for mutual strife. The Princes Era ended with the reign of the Emperor [[Tewodros II]].\n\n===Reign of Emperor Tewodros II and scramble for Africa===\nIn 1868, following the imprisonment of several [[Missionary|missionaries]] and representatives of the [[United Kingdom|British]] government, the British engaged in the punitive [[British Expedition to Abyssinia|Expedition to Abyssinia]]. This campaign was a success for Britain and the Ethiopian emperor committed suicide.\n\nFrom 1874 to 1876, the Empire, under [[Yohannes IV]], won the [[Ethiopian-Egyptian War]], decisively beating the invading forces at the [[Battle of Gundet]], in [[Hamasien]] province.

Italy, seeking a [[Colonialism|colonial presence]] in Africa, invaded Ethiopia and following a [[Italo-Ethiopian War of 1887\u20131889|successful conquest]] of some coastal regions, forced the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] upon [[Shewa]] (an autonomous kingdom within the empire), creating the colony of [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]].\n\n[[File:Menelik - Adoua-2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|[[Menelik II]] observes the [[battle of Adwa]] against the Italian invasion army in 1896.

Ethiopia repudiated the treaty in 1893. Insulted, Italy declared war on Ethiopia in 1895. The [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] resulted in the 1896 [[Battle of Adwa]], in which Italy was decisively defeated, as the Ethiopians were numerically superior, better equipment and support by Russia and France. As a result, the [[Treaty of Addis Ababa]] was signed in October, which strictly delineated the borders of Eritrea and forced Italy to recognize the independence of Ethiopia.\n\nBeginning in the 1880s, under the reign of the [[Menelik II|Emperor Menelik II]], the empire's forces set off from the central province of [[Shoa, Ethiopia|Shoa]] to incorporate through conquest inhabited lands to the west, east and south of its realm.<ref>{{cite journal |author=John Young |title=Regionalism and Democracy in Ethiopia |journal=Third World Quarterly |volume=19 |issue=2 |year=1998 |page=192 |jstor=3993156 |doi=10.1080/01436599814415}}</ref> The territories that were annexed included those of the western Oromo (non Shoan Oromo), Sidama, Gurage, Wolayta,<ref>International Crisis Group, \"Ethnic Federalism and its Discontents\".

The war lasted seven months before an Italian victory was declared. The Ethiopian Empire was incorporated into the Italian colony of [[Italian East Africa]]. The invasion was condemned by the [[League of Nations]], though not much was done to end the hostility.\n\nDuring the conflict, both Ethiopian and Italian troops committed war crimes. Ethiopian troops are known to have made use of [[Expanding bullet|Dum-Dum bullets]] (in violation of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]]) and mutilated captured soldiers (often with castration).{{sfn|Antonicelli|1975|p=79}}. Italian troops used [[sulfur mustard]] in [[chemical warfare]], ignoring the [[Geneva Protocol]] that it had signed seven years earlier. The Italian military dropped mustard gas in bombs, sprayed it from airplanes and spread it in powdered form on the ground. 150,000 chemical casualties were reported, mostly from mustard gas. In the aftermath of the war Italy annexed Ethiopia, uniting it with Italy's other colonies in eastern Africa to form the new colony of Italian East Africa, and [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] adopted the title \"Emperor of Abyssinia\".\n\nOn 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on the United Kingdom and France, as France was in the process of being conquered by [[Germany]] at the time and [[Benito Mussolini]] wished to expand Italy's colonial holdings. The [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]] in August 1940 was successful, but the war turned against Italy afterward. [[Haile Selassie]] returned to Ethiopia from England to help rally the resistance. The British began [[East African Campaign (World War II)|their own invasion in January 1941]] with the help of Ethiopian freedom fighters, and the last organized Italian resistance in Italian East Africa surrendered in November 1941, ending Italian rule.\n\n===Fall of monarchy===\n[[File:Haile Selassie (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Haile Selassie]] was the last Emperor of the Ethiopian Empire.]]\nIn 1974 a pro-Soviet [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] [[Military dictatorship|military junta]], the \"[[Derg]]\", led by [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], deposed [[Haile Selassie]] and established a [[socialist republic]].

These social groups consisted of the monks; the debtera; lay officials (including judges); men at arms giving personal protection to the wives of dignitaries and to princesses; the shimaglle, who were the lords and hereditary landowners; their farm labourers or serfs; traders; artisans; wandering singers; and the soldiers, who were called chewa. According to modern thinking, some of these categories are not true classes. But at least the shimaglle, the serfs, the chewa, the artisans and the traders constitute definite classes.

In the north, in what is now Eritrea, Ethiopia managed to repulse [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman conquest of Habesh|invasion]] attempts, although losing its access to the [[Red Sea]] to them.\n\nReacting to these challenges, Ethiopia started to expand westwards, conquering the [[Lake Tana]] area and much of [[Beta Israel]] territory in [[Begemder]]. In the 1630s Emperor [[Fasilides]] founded the new capital of [[Gondar]], marking the start for a new golden age known as \"Gondarine period\". It saw a relative peace, the successful integration of the Oromo and a flourishing of culture. With the deaths of Emperor [[Iyasu II]] (1755) and especially [[Iyoas I]] (1769) the realm eventually entered a period of decentralization, known as [[Zemene Mesafint|\"Era of the Princes\"]]. The [[Shewa]] region factually seceded and constituted a kingdom of its own, while within the Empire, regional warlords contested for power, with the Emperor being barely more than a mere puppet.\n\nEmperor [[Tewodros II]] (r. 1855\u20131868) put an end into that state, reunified the Empire and led it into the modern period before dying during the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]]. His successor [[Yohannes IV]] engaged primarily in war and successfully fought [[Ethiopian-Egyptian War|the Egyptians]] and the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdists]] before dying against the latter in the [[Battle of Gallabat]] in 1889. Emperor [[Menelik II]], now residing in the recently founded town of [[Addis Abeba]], continued and concluded the policy of expansion of his predecessor, subjugating many people and kingdoms in what is now western, southern and eastern Ethiopia, like [[Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa]], [[Welayta people#History|Wolaytta]] or [[Aussa Sultanate|Aussa]]. Thus, he gave Ethiopia the geographical extent it has today. In the north he was confronted with an expanding [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Decisively defeating it at the [[Battle of Adwa]] in 1896 with the aid of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and France, Menelik ensured Ethiopia's independence and [[Italian Eritrea|confined Italy to Eritrea]].\n\nLater, after the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], the [[Italian Empire]] occupied Ethiopia and established the [[Italian East Africa]] colony in the region. After World War II, the Italians were driven out with the help of the British army. The country was one of the founding members of the [[United Nations]], and in 1962 annexed Eritrea. However, the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] led to the [[Eritrean War of Independence|independence of Eritrea]] and fall of the Empire in 1974.\n\nBy 1974, Ethiopia was one of only three countries in the world to have the title of [[Emperor]] for its head of state, together with [[Japan]] and [[Iran]] under the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. It was the second-to-last country in Africa to use the title of Emperor; the only one later was the [[Central African Empire]], which was implemented between 1976 and 1979 by [[Emperor of Central Africa|Emperor]] [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa|Bokassa I]].\n\n==History==\n===D'mt and Kingdom of Aksum===\n{{Main|D\u02bfmt|Kingdom of Aksum}}\n[[File:Axumite Jar Spout (2822628227).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Kingdom of Aksum]] jar spout]]\nEthiopia's human occupation began early, as evidenced by the findings{{Which|date=July 2018}}. It is believed that the [[ancient Egypt]]ians claimed that [[Land of Punt|Punt]], known as gold country, was in Ethiopia in 980{{nbsp}}BC.

Notable philosophers from that area are [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]] and [[Walda Heywat]].

This was a period of Ethiopian history with numerous conflicts between the various [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Ras|ras]] (equivalent to the English [[duke]]s) and the emperor, who had only limited power and only dominated the area around the contemporary capital of [[Gondar]].

Ethiopia repudiated the treaty in 1893. Insulted, Italy declared war on Ethiopia in 1895. The [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] resulted in the 1896 [[Battle of Adwa]], in which Italy was decisively defeated, as the Ethiopians were numerically superior, better equipment and support by Russia and France.

The invasion was condemned by the [[League of Nations]], though not much was done to end the hostility.\n\nDuring the conflict, both Ethiopian and Italian troops committed war crimes.

Italian troops used [[sulfur mustard]] in [[chemical warfare]], ignoring the [[Geneva Protocol]] that it had signed seven years earlier. The Italian military dropped mustard gas in bombs, sprayed it from airplanes and spread it in powdered form on the ground. 150,000 chemical casualties were reported, mostly from mustard gas. In the aftermath of the war Italy annexed Ethiopia, uniting it with Italy's other colonies in eastern Africa to form the new colony of Italian East Africa, and [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] adopted the title \"Emperor of Abyssinia\".\n\nOn 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on the United Kingdom and France, as France was in the process of being conquered by [[Germany]] at the time and [[Benito Mussolini]] wished to expand Italy's colonial holdings. The [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]] in August 1940 was successful, but the war turned against Italy afterward. [[Haile Selassie]] returned to Ethiopia from England to help rally the resistance. The British began [[East African Campaign (World War II)|their own invasion in January 1941]] with the help of Ethiopian freedom fighters, and the last organized Italian resistance in Italian East Africa surrendered in November 1941, ending Italian rule.\n\n===Fall of monarchy===\n[[File:Haile Selassie (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Haile Selassie]] was the last Emperor of the Ethiopian Empire.]]\nIn 1974 a pro-Soviet [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] [[Military dictatorship|military junta]], the \"[[Derg]]\", led by [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], deposed [[Haile Selassie]] and established a [[socialist republic]].
