The origin of the name ''Niger'', which originally applied only to the middle reaches of the Niger River, is uncertain. The word is likely an alteration of the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] name ''egerew <u>n-iger</u>ewen''  used by inhabitants along the middle reaches of the river around [[Timbuktu]] prior to 19th-century European colonialism.<ref>The Arabic name ''nahr al-anhur'' is a direct translation of the Tuareg.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Niger |title=''Online Etymological Dictionary'' |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Nigeria|Timeline of Nigerian history}}\n[[File:Intricate bronze ceremonial pot, 9th century, Igbo-Ukwu, Nigeria.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Ceremonial Igbo pot from 9th-century [[Igbo-Ukwu]]]] \n\n=== Early (1,500 BC \u2013 1500) ===\n{{Further|History of Nigeria before 1500}}\n[[File:Nok sculpture Louvre 70-1998-11-1.jpg|thumb|[[Nok]] sculpture, [[terracotta]]]]\nThe [[Nok culture|Nok civilisation]] of [[Northern Nigeria]] flourished between 1,500 BC and AD 200.

In the 16th century, [[Portuguese explorers]] were the first Europeans to begin significant, direct trade with peoples of modern-day Nigeria, at the port they named [[Lagos]] and in [[Calabar]].

The Atlantic slave trade was engaged in by European companies until it was outlawed in 1807.  After that illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast by native slavers. Britain's [[West Africa Squadron]] sought to intercept the smugglers at sea. The rescued slaves were taken to [[Freetown]], a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba [[Akitoye]], and signing the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the [[Lagos Treaty of Cession]]. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland.

The following year, it chartered the [[Royal Niger Company]] under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British [[protectorate]], and part of the [[British Empire]], the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered [[Benin Empire|Benin]] in 1897, and, in the [[Anglo-Aro War]] (1901\u20131902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.  In 1914, the British formally united the Niger area as the ''Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria''. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Protectorates and [[Lagos Colony]]. Inhabitants of the southern region sustained more interaction, economic and cultural, with the British and other Europeans owing to the coastal economy.<ref>Toyin Falola and Matthew M.

Many of the immigrants, sometimes called [[Saro (Nigeria)|Saro]] (immigrants from Sierra Leone) and Amaro (ex-slaves from Brazil)<ref>Abiola Dosumu Elegbede-Fernandez, ''Lagos A Legacy of Honour.''

The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country, owing to the influence of [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonisation]] that ended in 1960.\n\nMany French speakers from surrounding countries have influenced the English spoken in the border regions of Nigeria and some Nigerian citizens have become fluent enough in French to work in the surrounding countries. The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is mostly spoken like the French spoken in Benin. French may also be mixed with English as it is in Cameroon.\n\nThe major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[languages of Africa]]: the majority are [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Ijaw language|Ijaw]], [[Fulfulde]], [[Ogoni language|Ogoni]], and [[Edo language|Edo]]. [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily in [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]], is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] family, and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language.\n\nEven though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria itself.\n\nWith the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. [[Nigerian Pidgin English]], often known simply as \"[[Pidgin]]\" or \"Broken\" (Broken English), is also a popular [[lingua franca]], though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang. The pidgin English or Nigerian English is widely spoken within the [[Niger Delta]] Regions, predominantly in [[Warri]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Agenebode]], [[Ewu]], and [[Benin City]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Multilingualism: A Nigerian Case Study |first=Efurosibina E. |last=Adegbija |publisher=Africa World Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-59221-173-9 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=auI_WuBrWncC&pg=PA55 |location=Last paragraph |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Nigeria}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Nigeria (2013)<ref name=\"Cia 19\">CIA Factbook : Nigeria [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html] (Retrieved 1 May 2019)</ref>\n\n|label1 = [[Islam]]\n|value1 = 51.6\n|color1 = Green\n|label2 = [[Christianity]]\n|value2 = 47\n|color2 = DodgerBlue\n|label3 = [[Traditional African religions]]\n|value3 = 1.4\n|color3 = White\n}}\n\nNigeria is a religiously diverse society, with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] being the most widely professed religions.

The Atlantic slave trade was engaged in by European companies until it was outlawed in 1807.  After that illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast by native slavers. Britain's [[West Africa Squadron]] sought to intercept the smugglers at sea. The rescued slaves were taken to [[Freetown]], a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba [[Akitoye]], and signing the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the [[Lagos Treaty of Cession]]. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland.

The following year, it chartered the [[Royal Niger Company]] under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British [[protectorate]], and part of the [[British Empire]], the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered [[Benin Empire|Benin]] in 1897, and, in the [[Anglo-Aro War]] (1901\u20131902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.  In 1914, the British formally united the Niger area as the ''Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria''. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Protectorates and [[Lagos Colony]].

With the fall of oil prices during the [[1980s oil glut]] Nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigerian authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its [[Paris Club]] creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15&nbsp;billion annually for poverty reduction programmes.

The spacecraft was operated by [[NigComSat]] and the Nigerian Space Agency, [[NASRDA]]. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after running out of power because of an anomaly in its solar array.

The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country, owing to the influence of [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonisation]] that ended in 1960.\n\nMany French speakers from surrounding countries have influenced the English spoken in the border regions of Nigeria and some Nigerian citizens have become fluent enough in French to work in the surrounding countries. The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is mostly spoken like the French spoken in Benin. French may also be mixed with English as it is in Cameroon.\n\nThe major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[languages of Africa]]: the majority are [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Ijaw language|Ijaw]], [[Fulfulde]], [[Ogoni language|Ogoni]], and [[Edo language|Edo]]. [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily in [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]], is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] family, and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language.\n\nEven though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria itself.\n\nWith the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. [[Nigerian Pidgin English]], often known simply as \"[[Pidgin]]\" or \"Broken\" (Broken English), is also a popular [[lingua franca]], though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang. The pidgin English or Nigerian English is widely spoken within the [[Niger Delta]] Regions, predominantly in [[Warri]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Agenebode]], [[Ewu]], and [[Benin City]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Multilingualism: A Nigerian Case Study |first=Efurosibina E. |last=Adegbija |publisher=Africa World Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-59221-173-9 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=auI_WuBrWncC&pg=PA55 |location=Last paragraph |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Nigeria}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Nigeria (2013)<ref name=\"Cia 19\">CIA Factbook : Nigeria [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html] (Retrieved 1 May 2019)</ref>\n\n|label1 = [[Islam]]\n|value1 = 51.6\n|color1 = Green\n|label2 = [[Christianity]]\n|value2 = 47\n|color2 = DodgerBlue\n|label3 = [[Traditional African religions]]\n|value3 = 1.4\n|color3 = White\n}}\n\nNigeria is a religiously diverse society, with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] being the most widely professed religions.

Although spurred to life by events in [[Soviet Russia]] in the aftermath of [[World War I]], the party had roots in pre-existing [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] and [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] organisations, including in particular the independent [[Wellington]] Socialist Party, supporters of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] in the Auckland region, and a network of [[impossiblism|impossiblist]] study groups of miners on the west coast of the South Island.\n\nNever high on the list of priorities of the [[Communist International]], the CPNZ was considered an appendage of the [[Communist Party of Australia]] until 1928, when it began to function as a fully independent national party. Party membership remained small, only briefly topping the 1,000 mark, with its members subjected to government repression and isolated by expulsions from the mainstream labour movement concentrated in the [[New Zealand Labour Party]].\n\nDuring the period of the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of the 1960s, the CPNZ sided with the Chinese government headed by [[Mao Tse-tung]]. The party splintered into a multiplicity of tiny political parties after 1966 and no longer exists as an independent group.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nAs the 20th Century dawned, New Zealand was recognised by adherents of International Socialism around the globe as a sort of laboratory test case of [[social democracy|social democratic government]] in practice.

The [[New Zealand Socialist Party]] (NZSP), founded in 1901, included in its ranks a left wing which eschewed political action, arguing that socialism could only be won by the direct efforts of the organised working class acting through their unions.<ref name=Motto162>Kerry Taylor, \"'Our Motto, No Compromise': The Ideological Origins and Foundation of the Communist Party of New Zealand,\" ''New Zealand Journal of History,'' vol. 28, no. 2 (October 1994), p. 162.</ref>\n\nOthers adhered to the theories of [[Daniel DeLeon]], which advocated the use of the ballot box for a revolutionary transformation of society leading to a socialist state governed by revolutionary industrial unions.<ref name=Motto162-163>Taylor, \"'Our Motto, No Compromise,'\" pp. 162\u2013163.</ref> From 1911 the ideas of [[syndicalism]] began to gain a foothold in the [[Auckland]] area under the banner of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], while the anti-political [[impossibilism|impossibilist]] ideas of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] made their mark upon others.<ref name=Motto162-163 /> All of these tendencies would contribute adherents to the pioneer New Zealand communist movement.\n\nParticularly worthy of note were a small network of [[Marxist]] study circles were formed during the wartime years, concentrated mainly in the small mining communities of the [[South Island]].<ref name=Roth337>[[Bert Roth]], \"New Zealand,\" in Witold S.

While in many countries this meant directives to immediately shatter joint work with social democratic political and trade union leaders, the Comintern's \"Resolution on the Tasks of the Communist Party of New Zealand,\" brought back to Wellington by Griffin, maintained that New Zealand was still marked by \"the steady upward swing of capitalist development, combined with relatively good conditions for the workers,\" thereby serving to \"prevent the possibility of a general revolutionary situation in New Zealand.\"<ref name=1928Res>\"Resolution on the Tasks of the Communist Party of New Zealand,\" RGASPI fond 495, opis 20, delo 430; quoted in Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 274.</ref> Instead of consolidating itself for an envisioned revolutionary uprising, the CPNZ was directed to concentrate its attention on continued agitation and propaganda.<ref name=1928Res />\n\nDick Griffin became the first full-time organiser of the CPNZ in May 1929.<ref name=Third277>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 277.</ref> In August of that same year he assumed the role of General Secretary of the organisation.<ref name=Third277 />\n\nIt was only in March 1930 that the CPNZ received a communication from ECCI directing it to take on ultra-radical policies in accord the Third Period analysis.<ref name=Third274>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 274.</ref> The party's previous policies were deemed incorrect and the CPNZ was instructed to attempt to assume leadership of the New Zealand workers movement by working to \"expose and destroy all the Labourite, [[pacifism|pacifist]], social democratic illusions about the possibility of solving social problems...under the existing political and economic regime.\"<ref>Letter from the Political Secretariat of ECCI to CPNZ, 4 March 1930, RGASPI f. 495, op. 20 d. 430; quoted in Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 274.</ref> This marked the actual beginning of [[sectarianism|sectarian]] Third Period tactics in New Zealand.\n\nThe CPNZ was beset by rapid membership turnover throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s, with general secretary Griffin accused of operating a personal dictatorship, spurring rank-and-file discontent.<ref name=Third278>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 278.</ref> The CPNZ was also subjected to unrelenting police operations by the national government, including a July 1929 raid which seized the internal records and literature of the Wellington branch and the subsequent successful prosecution of five members of the governing Central Executive Committee for possession and sale of allegedly seditious literature.<ref name=Third278 /> Party leaders were particularly targeted, with three more members of the Central Executive Committee arrested in 1930, four more in 1931 and 1932, and all seven members in 1933.<ref name=Third279>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 279.</ref>\n\nThe party was further disorganised by the churn of its rank-and-file members in and out of the party, exemplified by the count of Wellington members booming from 51 in March to 80 by May 1931 before plummeting to just 25 in January 1932.<ref name=Third278 /> Things grew so bad that by October 1932 only one member of the Central Executive Committee had been a member of the party for longer than a year, with some members for as little as two months.<ref name=Third278 /> The party was impoverished, its coffers drained both by the cost of producing the ''Red Worker'' (rival publication to the mainstream trade unionist ''Maoriland Worker),'' and by courtroom losses in several [[libel]] cases brought against that publication.<ref name=Third278 /> Party publications were carefully scrutinised, with two issues of the ''Red Worker'' and a pamphlet found to be seditious in 1932 and those responsible for their publication jailed for more than a year.<ref name=Third279 />\n\nThe CPNZ also lost its influence in the country's trade unions during the late 1920s and early 1930s owing to its rigid support for unpopular [[secondary strike]]s in solidarity with workers in other countries. This was epitomised by a 1929 call for a miners' strike in sympathy with mine and timber workers in Australia, which annihilated party influence among the miners of the South Island's West Coast and 1931 efforts to blackball a Japanese ship, which led to discord and alienation from the party in the Seamen's Union.<ref name=Third282>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 282.</ref>\n\n===\"Freemanisation\"===\n\nBy the middle of 1933, the Communist Party of New Zealand was in crisis, with its entire Central Committee jailed for publication of the pamphlet ''Karl Marx and the Struggle of the Masses.''<ref name=Third288>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" pg. 288.</ref> The New Zealand-born [[Fred Freeman]] was returned to the country to assume the position of general secretary following four years in Moscow at the service of the Comintern.<ref name=Third288 /> More politically astute and organisationally adroit than Griffin, Freeman promoted university graduates [[Clement Gordon Watson]] and his future wife, Elsie Farrelly, to positions of party leadership, where they were joined by party veteran Ernie Brooks.<ref name=Third288 /> This group of four would dominate CPNZ politics through the end of 1935.<ref name=Third288 />\n\nThe operations of the CPNZ came to resemble those of larger and more efficient communist parties in other countries, with official directives and circulars issued systematically for the first time by the Central Committee to local party committees.<ref name=Third288 /> Representatives of the Central Committee also began to travel regularly to visit local party organisations.<ref name=Third288 /> Dues collecting and record-keeping of branches was made more regular and increased attention was paid to the problem of internal security in an effort to stave the crippling series of arrests that had swept the party.<ref>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" pp. 288\u2013289.</ref>\n\nComintern policy began to change in 1933 following the victory of the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany, leading to eventual advocacy of a so-called [[Popular Front]] against fascism by 1935.

Tensions worsened in 1940, when the [[Battle of Britain|Great Britain came under attack]] \u2013 a country to which New Zealanders felt a particular national affinity.

The party was divided between supporters of the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and those who claimed Khrushchev was a \"revisionist\" and chose instead to follow China under [[Mao Zedong]]. Subsequently, the CPNZ under the leadership of [[Victor Wilcox]] became the first official Communist party in the First World to side with Mao. The majority of the party and its newspaper ''The People's Voice'' adopted Maoism, while supporters of Khrushchev's [[Soviet Union]] (mainly Auckland trade unionists) split off to form the [[Socialist Unity Party (New Zealand)|Socialist Unity Party]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=29}} The Communist Party also maintained warm ties with the [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Indonesian Communist Party]] and supported Indonesia during the [[Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation]] (1963&ndash;1966).

Members of the CPNZ national leadership who continued to uphold the line of the post-Mao [[Chinese Communist Party]] including Wilcox were expelled, and formed the [[Organisation for Marxist Unity \u2013 New Zealand|Preparatory Committee for the Formation of the Communist Party of New Zealand (Marxist\u2013Leninist)]].{{sfn|Alexander|2001|p=198}} \n\nMeanwhile, other former members of the CPNZ in Wellington, where the party branch had been expelled ''en masse'' in 1970, founded the Wellington Marxist Leninist Organisation, which in 1980 merged with the Northern Communist Organisation to form the [[Workers' Communist League (New Zealand)|Workers' Communist League]] (WCL).{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=29}}\n\nWhile the CPNZ never had mass influence or real political power, it pursued a Leninist vanguard party approach that involved trying to [[entryism|influence and penetrate]] the Labour Party, the  New Zealand trade union movement, various single-issue protest groups and public opinion on foreign policy, industrial activity, opposition to New Zealand's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], [[M\u0101ori protest movement|M\u0101ori rights]], the anti-[[Apartheid]] movement, feminism, and [[nuclear disarmament]], and anti-colonial activism in the Pacific region; issues in which communists and non-communist left-wing elements found common cause.{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|pp=29-30}}\n\n===Decline and legacy===\nAfter the collapse of Communism in Albania, the Communist Party of New Zealand gradually changed its views, renouncing its former support of [[Stalinism]], [[Maoism]], and [[Enver Hoxha|Hoxhaism]]. Instead, under the leadership of its last general secretary, [[Grant Morgan]], it developed a [[State Capitalist]] analysis of the Stalinist states. The party now believed that the Soviet Union had never been socialist at all, not even in Stalin's time. Opponents of this change departed and established the [[Communist Party of Aotearoa]] (a Maoist group) and the Marxist\u2013Leninist Collective (a pro-Hoxha group). The Communist Party of New Zealand eventually merged with the neo-Trotskyist [[International Socialist Organization (New Zealand)|International Socialist Organization]] in 1994. The resultant party, known as the [[Socialist Workers Organization (New Zealand)|Socialist Workers Organization]], evolved into the small but highly active [[Socialist Worker (Aotearoa)]]. However, most of the ISO members split off again and resumed their own organisation. SW voted to dissolve itself at its conference in January 2012.   A number of SW members split from the organisation in 2008 to form [[Socialist Aotearoa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fightback.org.nz/resources/open-letter-to-socialist-aotearoa-may-2008/|title=Open Letter to Socialist Aotearoa (May 2008)|date=2008-05-05|website=FightBack|language=en|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 the [[New Communist Party of Aotearoa]] was founded, with its first [[Party conference|party congress]] held in Wellington on 21 and 22 November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newcommunist.party/congress/|title=Announcing our First National Congress \u2013 New Communist Party of Aotearoa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newcommunist.party/1nc/|title=First National Congress of the NCPA \u2013 New Communist Party of Aotearoa|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref>\n\n== Membership ==\n{{Communist parties}}\n::{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"3\"\n|-\n!

Although spurred to life by events in [[Soviet Russia]] in the aftermath of [[World War I]], the party had roots in pre-existing [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] and [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] organisations, including in particular the independent [[Wellington]] Socialist Party, supporters of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] in the Auckland region, and a network of [[impossiblism|impossiblist]] study groups of miners on the west coast of the South Island.\n\nNever high on the list of priorities of the [[Communist International]], the CPNZ was considered an appendage of the [[Communist Party of Australia]] until 1928, when it began to function as a fully independent national party. Party membership remained small, only briefly topping the 1,000 mark, with its members subjected to government repression and isolated by expulsions from the mainstream labour movement concentrated in the [[New Zealand Labour Party]].\n\nDuring the period of the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of the 1960s, the CPNZ sided with the Chinese government headed by [[Mao Tse-tung]]. The party splintered into a multiplicity of tiny political parties after 1966 and no longer exists as an independent group.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nAs the 20th Century dawned, New Zealand was recognised by adherents of International Socialism around the globe as a sort of laboratory test case of [[social democracy|social democratic government]] in practice. One June 1901 pamphlet put to print by [[Julius Wayland|J.A. Wayland]], proprietor of the mass circulation socialist weekly ''[[Appeal to Reason (newspaper)|Appeal to Reason]],'' detailed the ways in which the island nation of 720,000 had already passed extensive legislation for the benefit of wage workers, backed by 200 agents of the \"Labour Intelligence Department.\"<ref name=Nutshell5-6>''New Zealand in a Nutshell.'' Wayland's Monthly No. 14. Girard, KS: J.A. Wayland, June 1901; pp. 5\u20136.</ref> While the country was declared \"no Utopia,\" New Zealand nevertheless was said to have \"no real want\" and \"no unemployment problem to solve.\"<ref name=Nutshell5-6 /> Instead trade unions were not merely formally recognised but were pervasive and had managed to mitigate the [[class struggle]] through [[arbitration]] laws sanctioned by law, with disputes decided by three member courts of arbitration, each including representatives of capital, labour, and the courts as provided in the 1894 [[Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act]].<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pp. 7, 21.</ref>\n\nAn extensive system of public works were in existence, governed by the principle of \"fair work and fair pay.\"<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' p. 7.</ref> More than 200 employment bureaus dotted the country, connecting every willing worker with a job.<ref name=Nutshell8>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pg. 8.</ref> [[Sweatshop]]s were banned, as was systematic home manufacturing, with mandatory labelling of all products made outside of factories.<ref name=Nutshell8 /> Wages were generally high and the 48-hour week said to be a local maximum.<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' p. 9.</ref> The presence of \"tramps\" had been eliminated through town allotments of small homesteads to poor workers, granted through easily affordable perpetual leases.<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pp. 10\u201311.</ref> The power of [[eminent domain]] had been assumed by the [[New Zealand parliament]] in 1896, allowing the state to assume ownership of large estates at their assessed price for division into small farms.<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' p. 11.</ref>\n\nState finance had been accomplished by a [[property tax|tax on land values]] and the establishment of a progressive [[income tax]].<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pp. 12\u201313.</ref> The national government itself owned and operated the railways, telegraph and telephone systems, schools, and [[postal savings bank]]s throughout the country even before the landmark election of 1891.<ref>''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' pp. 15\u201317, 34.</ref> Workers' compensation insurance to protect against injury was required by law, and low cost [[life insurance]] had been provided by the state since 1869. Old age pensions were provided to all New Zealanders 65 years of age or older who had been resident in the country for at least 25 years.<ref name=\"Nutshell, pg. 19\">''New Zealand in a Nutshell,'' p. 19.</ref>\n\n\"The New Zealanders are collectivists, although they adhere to the old party names of liberals and tories,\" the American examiners enthused, with the [[New Zealand Liberal Party]] reckoned as equivalent to the [[Fabian Society|Fabian socialists]] of Great Britain.<ref name=\"Nutshell, pg. 19\"/> [[Richard Seddon]] (1845\u20131906), Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1893 until his death in 1906, oversaw implementation of an array of social welfare programs as leader of the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]]\n\nThis idyllic vision \u2013 which incidentally paid no attention to the treatment of or conditions endured by the [[M\u0101ori people|indigenous Polynesian population]] \u2013 proved to be short-lived. With the eruption of [[World War I]] in 1914, [[Military history of New Zealand in World War I|New Zealand sent soldiers to Allied campaigns in Turkey, Palestine, and France and Flanders]]. Over 120,000 New Zealanders were enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, with about 100,000 men and women eventually serving as soldiers and nurses in Europe, out of a population of 1.14&nbsp;million.<ref name=MC1>[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/first-world-war-overview/introduction \"First World War \u2013 Overview,\"] History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage, p. 1.</ref> Of these, about 18,000 were killed in battle and another 41,000 felled by wounds or disease \u2013 a casualty rate approaching 60%.<ref name=MC1 /> [[Conscription]] was introduced in 1916, with the stream of volunteer enthusiasts exhausted.<ref name=MC5>\"First World War \u2013 Overview,\" p. 5.</ref> As casualties continued to mount into 1917, public war-weariness set in, fuelling political discontent.<ref name=MC5 /> A [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] movement began to emerge.\n\n===Establishment===\n[[File:Soviets-At-Worl.jpg|thumb|right|180px|West Coast American edition of Lenin's ''The Soviets at Work'' (1919) was an influential political tract among NZ revolutionary socialist activists.]]\n\nThere were isolated reflections of international radical tendencies present in New Zealand from shortly after the turn of the 20th Century. The [[New Zealand Socialist Party]] (NZSP), founded in 1901, included in its ranks a left wing which eschewed political action, arguing that socialism could only be won by the direct efforts of the organised working class acting through their unions.<ref name=Motto162>Kerry Taylor, \"'Our Motto, No Compromise': The Ideological Origins and Foundation of the Communist Party of New Zealand,\" ''New Zealand Journal of History,'' vol. 28, no. 2 (October 1994), p. 162.</ref>\n\nOthers adhered to the theories of [[Daniel DeLeon]], which advocated the use of the ballot box for a revolutionary transformation of society leading to a socialist state governed by revolutionary industrial unions.<ref name=Motto162-163>Taylor, \"'Our Motto, No Compromise,'\" pp. 162\u2013163.</ref> From 1911 the ideas of [[syndicalism]] began to gain a foothold in the [[Auckland]] area under the banner of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], while the anti-political [[impossibilism|impossibilist]] ideas of the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] made their mark upon others.<ref name=Motto162-163 /> All of these tendencies would contribute adherents to the pioneer New Zealand communist movement.\n\nParticularly worthy of note were a small network of [[Marxist]] study circles were formed during the wartime years, concentrated mainly in the small mining communities of the [[South Island]].<ref name=Roth337>[[Bert Roth]], \"New Zealand,\" in Witold S. Sworakowski (ed.), ''World Communism: A Handbook, 1918\u20131965.'' Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1973; p. 337.</ref> Wartime violence and the [[October Revolution|October 1917 Revolution]] in Russia proved a stimulant to revolutionary ideas, drawing members to these groups, leading to their formal affiliation during the summer Christmas holiday of 1918 as the [[New Zealand Marxist Association]] (NZMA).<ref name=Roth337 /> This group electing [[T. W. Feary]] as secretary of the organisation and in 1919 dispatched him and two others to North America to gain additional information on the revolutionary movement through the American and Canadian prism.<ref name=Roth337 />\n\nVisiting the Pacific Coast cities of San Francisco and [[Vancouver]], Feary and his co-thinkers obtained copies of a number of influential publications, including ''[[Ten Days That Shook the World]],'' a participant's account of the October Revolution by [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], and ''The Soviets at Work,'' a widely reprinted pamphlet by [[V. I. Lenin|Lenin]].<ref name=Roth337 /> These were successfully smuggled back to New Zealand, with the Lenin tract immediately put into print in yet another new edition.<ref name=Roth337 />\n\nAdding to the complexity of the fragmented radical movement was the Wellington Socialist Party, formerly a branch of the NZSP which had split with the national organisation in 1913 over the issue of electoral politics. While the main body of the NZSP had gone on to found the [[New Zealand Labour Party]] in 1916, the Wellington Socialist Party believed in [[direct action]] and use of the [[general strike]] for the intended overthrow of capitalism and had forced a split.<ref name=Motto168>Taylor, \"'Our Motto, No Compromise,'\" p. 168.</ref> Suffering attenuation but surviving the war, this Wellington organisation would constitute the main component of the new Communist Party of New Zealand.<ref name=Motto168 />\n\nBy 1921 sentiment had begun to build for the establishment of a communist political party along those lines advocated by the fledgling [[Communist International]]. A preparatory conference was called for Easter weekend, 26\u201327 March 1921, in [[Wellington]].<ref name=Roth337 /> This preliminary gathering was followed with a formal organisational conference held on Saturday, 9 April, at Wellington Socialist Hall \u2013 headquarters of the Wellington Socialist Party \u2013 at which time the Communist Party of New Zealand (CPNZ) was formally established.<ref name=Motto170-171>Taylor, \"'Our Motto, No Compromise,'\" pp. 170\u2013171.</ref>\n\nOf the origins of the Communist Party, historian Kerry Taylor writes:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The foundation of the CPNZ will always remain shrouded in a degree of mystery. No direct record of the event survives \u2014 the minutes have long since been lost and no reports appeared in the media at the time.... The precise nature of the discussion and debate is obscure but the delegates had before them the constitution of the Communist Party of Australia and a draft manifesto and constitution drawn up over the previous few months by members of the Wellington Socialist Party.\"<ref name=Motto170-171 /></blockquote>\n\n[[E. J.

While in many countries this meant directives to immediately shatter joint work with social democratic political and trade union leaders, the Comintern's \"Resolution on the Tasks of the Communist Party of New Zealand,\" brought back to Wellington by Griffin, maintained that New Zealand was still marked by \"the steady upward swing of capitalist development, combined with relatively good conditions for the workers,\" thereby serving to \"prevent the possibility of a general revolutionary situation in New Zealand.\"<ref name=1928Res>\"Resolution on the Tasks of the Communist Party of New Zealand,\" RGASPI fond 495, opis 20, delo 430; quoted in Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 274.</ref> Instead of consolidating itself for an envisioned revolutionary uprising, the CPNZ was directed to concentrate its attention on continued agitation and propaganda.<ref name=1928Res />\n\nDick Griffin became the first full-time organiser of the CPNZ in May 1929.<ref name=Third277>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 277.</ref> In August of that same year he assumed the role of General Secretary of the organisation.<ref name=Third277 />\n\nIt was only in March 1930 that the CPNZ received a communication from ECCI directing it to take on ultra-radical policies in accord the Third Period analysis.<ref name=Third274>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 274.</ref> The party's previous policies were deemed incorrect and the CPNZ was instructed to attempt to assume leadership of the New Zealand workers movement by working to \"expose and destroy all the Labourite, [[pacifism|pacifist]], social democratic illusions about the possibility of solving social problems...under the existing political and economic regime.\"<ref>Letter from the Political Secretariat of ECCI to CPNZ, 4 March 1930, RGASPI f. 495, op. 20 d. 430; quoted in Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 274.</ref> This marked the actual beginning of [[sectarianism|sectarian]] Third Period tactics in New Zealand.\n\nThe CPNZ was beset by rapid membership turnover throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s, with general secretary Griffin accused of operating a personal dictatorship, spurring rank-and-file discontent.<ref name=Third278>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 278.</ref> The CPNZ was also subjected to unrelenting police operations by the national government, including a July 1929 raid which seized the internal records and literature of the Wellington branch and the subsequent successful prosecution of five members of the governing Central Executive Committee for possession and sale of allegedly seditious literature.<ref name=Third278 /> Party leaders were particularly targeted, with three more members of the Central Executive Committee arrested in 1930, four more in 1931 and 1932, and all seven members in 1933.<ref name=Third279>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 279.</ref>\n\nThe party was further disorganised by the churn of its rank-and-file members in and out of the party, exemplified by the count of Wellington members booming from 51 in March to 80 by May 1931 before plummeting to just 25 in January 1932.<ref name=Third278 /> Things grew so bad that by October 1932 only one member of the Central Executive Committee had been a member of the party for longer than a year, with some members for as little as two months.<ref name=Third278 /> The party was impoverished, its coffers drained both by the cost of producing the ''Red Worker'' (rival publication to the mainstream trade unionist ''Maoriland Worker),'' and by courtroom losses in several [[libel]] cases brought against that publication.<ref name=Third278 /> Party publications were carefully scrutinised, with two issues of the ''Red Worker'' and a pamphlet found to be seditious in 1932 and those responsible for their publication jailed for more than a year.<ref name=Third279 />\n\nThe CPNZ also lost its influence in the country's trade unions during the late 1920s and early 1930s owing to its rigid support for unpopular [[secondary strike]]s in solidarity with workers in other countries. This was epitomised by a 1929 call for a miners' strike in sympathy with mine and timber workers in Australia, which annihilated party influence among the miners of the South Island's West Coast and 1931 efforts to blackball a Japanese ship, which led to discord and alienation from the party in the Seamen's Union.<ref name=Third282>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 282.</ref>\n\n===\"Freemanisation\"===\n\nBy the middle of 1933, the Communist Party of New Zealand was in crisis, with its entire Central Committee jailed for publication of the pamphlet ''Karl Marx and the Struggle of the Masses.''<ref name=Third288>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" pg. 288.</ref> The New Zealand-born [[Fred Freeman]] was returned to the country to assume the position of general secretary following four years in Moscow at the service of the Comintern.<ref name=Third288 /> More politically astute and organisationally adroit than Griffin, Freeman promoted university graduates [[Clement Gordon Watson]] and his future wife, Elsie Farrelly, to positions of party leadership, where they were joined by party veteran Ernie Brooks.<ref name=Third288 /> This group of four would dominate CPNZ politics through the end of 1935.<ref name=Third288 />\n\nThe operations of the CPNZ came to resemble those of larger and more efficient communist parties in other countries, with official directives and circulars issued systematically for the first time by the Central Committee to local party committees.<ref name=Third288 /> Representatives of the Central Committee also began to travel regularly to visit local party organisations.<ref name=Third288 /> Dues collecting and record-keeping of branches was made more regular and increased attention was paid to the problem of internal security in an effort to stave the crippling series of arrests that had swept the party.<ref>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" pp. 288\u2013289.</ref>\n\nComintern policy began to change in 1933 following the victory of the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany, leading to eventual advocacy of a so-called [[Popular Front]] against fascism by 1935. Under the Freeman leadership the CPNZ took the first tentative steps in this direction late in 1933 when the CPNZ approached the National Executive Committee of the [[New Zealand Labour Party]] with a proposal for a joint campaign against fascism.<ref name=Third289>Taylor, \"The Communist Party of New Zealand and the Third Period,\" p. 289.</ref> No answer was given.

Tensions worsened in 1940, when the [[Battle of Britain|Great Britain came under attack]] \u2013 a country to which New Zealanders felt a particular national affinity. Although membership in the CPNZ remained legal, ''People's Voice'' was suppressed by the government.<ref>Roth, \"New Zealand,\" pp. 338\u2013339.</ref>\n\nThe tide turned in June 1941 following the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]]. At that time, in accord with Soviet foreign policy, the CPNZ became vocal supporters of the war effort, which combined with the country's new status of military allies with the Soviet Union paved the way for the New Zealand party's growth in membership and influence.<ref name=Roth339>Roth, \"New Zealand,\" p. 339.</ref> By 1945 party membership reached its all-time high of approximately 2,000, while circulation of ''People's Voice'' topped 14,000 copies per week.<ref name=Roth339 /> This level of membership and support would continue through 1946, when new international circumstances would arise leading to the CPNZ's inexorable attrition.<ref name=Roth339 />\n\nA Communist Party candidate stood in the {{NZ electorate link|Auckland West}} {{By-election link|Auckland West|1940}} held after [[Michael Joseph Savage|Savage]]'s death, although after the low number of votes received in the {{NZ election link|1935}}, no Communist Party candidates stood in the {{NZ election link|1938}} or the {{NZ election link|1943}}.\n\n===Post-war era===\nThe Communist Party stood candidates in general elections from the {{NZ election link|1946}} to the {{NZ election link|1969}}; particularly in the {{NZ election link|1949}}, the {{NZ election link|1960}} and the {{NZ election link|1963}}; and in 3 by-elections; Brooklyn {{By-election link|Brooklyn|1951}}, Grey Lynn {{By-election link|Grey Lynn|1963}}, and Otahuhu {{By-election link|Otahuhu|1963}}. Candidates stood frequently in the  {{NZ electorate link|Christchurch Central}} electorate (7 elections) and the {{NZ electorate link|Island Bay}} electorate (8 elections; often [[Ronald Joseph Smith|Ronald Smith]]).

The party was divided between supporters of the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and those who claimed Khrushchev was a \"revisionist\" and chose instead to follow China under [[Mao Zedong]]. Subsequently, the CPNZ under the leadership of [[Victor Wilcox]] became the first official Communist party in the First World to side with Mao. The majority of the party and its newspaper ''The People's Voice'' adopted Maoism, while supporters of Khrushchev's [[Soviet Union]] (mainly Auckland trade unionists) split off to form the [[Socialist Unity Party (New Zealand)|Socialist Unity Party]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=29}} The Communist Party also maintained warm ties with the [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Indonesian Communist Party]] and supported Indonesia during the [[Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation]] (1963&ndash;1966). It also condemned the [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u201366|Indonesian mass killings]] that followed the alleged [[30 September Movement|30 September coup attempt]] as a right wing coup.{{sfn|Lim|2016|pp=49-53}}\n\nLater, when Mao died, the Communist Party of New Zealand began to follow the lead of [[Enver Hoxha]]'s [[Albania]], which they considered to be the last truly Communist country in the world. Members of the CPNZ national leadership who continued to uphold the line of the post-Mao [[Chinese Communist Party]] including Wilcox were expelled, and formed the [[Organisation for Marxist Unity \u2013 New Zealand|Preparatory Committee for the Formation of the Communist Party of New Zealand (Marxist\u2013Leninist)]].{{sfn|Alexander|2001|p=198}} \n\nMeanwhile, other former members of the CPNZ in Wellington, where the party branch had been expelled ''en masse'' in 1970, founded the Wellington Marxist Leninist Organisation, which in 1980 merged with the Northern Communist Organisation to form the [[Workers' Communist League (New Zealand)|Workers' Communist League]] (WCL).{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=29}}\n\nWhile the CPNZ never had mass influence or real political power, it pursued a Leninist vanguard party approach that involved trying to [[entryism|influence and penetrate]] the Labour Party, the  New Zealand trade union movement, various single-issue protest groups and public opinion on foreign policy, industrial activity, opposition to New Zealand's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], [[M\u0101ori protest movement|M\u0101ori rights]], the anti-[[Apartheid]] movement, feminism, and [[nuclear disarmament]], and anti-colonial activism in the Pacific region; issues in which communists and non-communist left-wing elements found common cause.{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|pp=29-30}}\n\n===Decline and legacy===\nAfter the collapse of Communism in Albania, the Communist Party of New Zealand gradually changed its views, renouncing its former support of [[Stalinism]], [[Maoism]], and [[Enver Hoxha|Hoxhaism]]. Instead, under the leadership of its last general secretary, [[Grant Morgan]], it developed a [[State Capitalist]] analysis of the Stalinist states. The party now believed that the Soviet Union had never been socialist at all, not even in Stalin's time. Opponents of this change departed and established the [[Communist Party of Aotearoa]] (a Maoist group) and the Marxist\u2013Leninist Collective (a pro-Hoxha group). The Communist Party of New Zealand eventually merged with the neo-Trotskyist [[International Socialist Organization (New Zealand)|International Socialist Organization]] in 1994. The resultant party, known as the [[Socialist Workers Organization (New Zealand)|Socialist Workers Organization]], evolved into the small but highly active [[Socialist Worker (Aotearoa)]]. However, most of the ISO members split off again and resumed their own organisation. SW voted to dissolve itself at its conference in January 2012.   A number of SW members split from the organisation in 2008 to form [[Socialist Aotearoa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fightback.org.nz/resources/open-letter-to-socialist-aotearoa-may-2008/|title=Open Letter to Socialist Aotearoa (May 2008)|date=2008-05-05|website=FightBack|language=en|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 the [[New Communist Party of Aotearoa]] was founded, with its first [[Party conference|party congress]] held in Wellington on 21 and 22 November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newcommunist.party/congress/|title=Announcing our First National Congress \u2013 New Communist Party of Aotearoa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newcommunist.party/1nc/|title=First National Congress of the NCPA \u2013 New Communist Party of Aotearoa|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref>\n\n== Membership ==\n{{Communist parties}}\n::{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"3\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Gopalan", "text_new": "'''Gopalan Anish Acharya ''' may refer to:\n\n[[File:Gopalan Anish Acharya .jpeg | thumb | 220x124px | right | Author ]]\n Religion from Ancient time\n\nAccording to the study of Ancient literature, Before any religion like Islam and Christianity. Most people believe in TENGIRSM religion which says the world is divided in three parts\n\nThree-world cosmology\nAs in most ancient beliefs, there is a \"celestial world\", the ground and an \"underworld\" in Tengrism.[78] The only connection between these realms is the \"Tree of Worlds\" that is in the center of the worlds.\n\n \n1. Sky (The father ), The God , The Place of God or Heaven. (Swarg Lok)\n2. Earth (The Mother ) The logic stands as everything we get to survive is provided by earth like a mother . ( Prithvi Lok)\n3. Inside Earth or other layer : is considered as unknown place of sinners or place of bad soul after death. Pathal Lok. \n\n So let\u2019s respect the Earth as we do to our mother and stand to save the environment ...\n\nLet\u2019s go through some interesting facts without hurting any religion.\n\nThe religion TENGIRSM \n\nTengrism also played a large role in the religion of Mongol Empires as the primary statespirituality. Genghis Khan ( Khan is considered as ruler of a place or area like sardar/Chowdhari/ Raja/ King it dose not indicate to any religion ) and several generations of his followers were Tengrian believers and \"Shaman-Kings\" until his fifth-generation descendant, Uzbeg Khan, turned to Islam in the 14th century.\n\nAccording to Hungarian archaeological research, the religion of the Magyars (Hungarians) until the end of the 10th century (before Christianity) was Tengrism.\n\nGenghis mentions both Eternal Tengri and \"heaven and earth\" when he says \"By the mercy of Eternal Tengri and the blessing of heaven and earth I have greatly increased in power, united all the great nation and brought them under my reins\" (paragraph 224). \n\nFor the first time the name Tengri recorded in Chinese chronicles from the 4th century BC as the sky god of the Xiongnu, it takes the Chinese form \u6491\u7281 (Cheng-li).\n\nGOD\nK\u00f6k Tengri (Blue Sky) is the Supreme Being, the One, the creator of everything. Usually it is understood pantheistically/panentheistically as a non-anthropomorphic Absolute, a concept identical to Taoist Tao, Indian Para Brahman, ancient Greek Apeiron, or Unified Field of modern science.[76]\n\nAll other deities are revered as Tengri's manifestations or spirits of the elements. Such, for instance, the pantheon of the ancient Turks: Yer-Sub, Umay, Erlik, Earth, Water, Fire, Sun, Moon, Star, Air, Clouds, Wind, Storm, Thunder and Lightning, Rain and Rainbow.[7\n\nTENGIRSM and BUDDHISM  \n\nThe 17th century Mongolian chronicle Altan Tobchi (Golden Summary) contains references to Tengri. Tengrism was assimilated into Mongolian Buddhism while surviving in purer forms only in far-northern Mongolia. Tengrist formulas and ceremonies were subsumed into the state religion. This is similar to the fusion of Buddhism and Shinto in Japan. The Altan Tobchi contains the following prayer at its very end\n\nTengrists oppose Islam, Christianity and Judaism as Semitic religions imposing a foreign religion to the Turks. And, according to some ones, by praying to the god of Islam the Turkic peoples would give their energy to the Jews and not to themselves (Aron Atabek [ru]).[56] It excludes the experiences of other nations, but offers Semitic history as if it were the history of all humanity. The principle of submission (both in Islam as well as in Christianity) is disregarded as one of the major failings. It allows rich people to abuse the ordinary people and makes human development stagnant. They advocate Turanism and abandonment of Islam as an Arab religion (Nihal Atsiz and others).[50] Prayer from the heart can only be in native language, not Arabic.[87] On the contrary, others assert that Tengri is indeed synonymous with Allah and that Turkic ancestors did not leave their former belief behind, but simply accepted Allah as new expression for Tengri.[88]\n\nTENGIRSM and CHRISTANITY\n\nHulegu Khan sent a letter in Latin to King Louis IX of France on April 10, 1262 from his capital Maragheh in Iran.[90][91] Kept in the Vienna National Library as MS 339 it is both an invitation for joint operations against the Mamluks as well as an imperious command to submit. The letter provides key insights into the Mongols' understanding of Tengrism's relationship to Christianity as well as furnishing one of the first Latin transcriptions of Tengri.\n\nAll meanings of Tengri including the sky, the most high God and \"a god\" are implied in the letter. Jesus Christ is called Misicatengrin or Messiah-Tengri in the letter. The Misica is from Syriac mshiha (Messiah, Christ) as opposed to Arabic masih. Another Syriac word in the letter is Barachmar (greetings). This points to the well-known Nestorian heritage within the Mongol Empire which used Syriac as its liturgical language.[92] The Mongolian letter of Arghun Khan to Pope Nicholas IV (1290) also uses the word Misica for Christ. William of Rubruck reported that Arig Boke, brother of Hulegu Khan, used the word Messiah near Karakorum in 1254 (Then they began to blaspheme against Christ, but Arabuccha stopped them saying: \"You must not speak so, for we know that the Messiah is God\")[93]. There are elements of syncretism between Tengrism and Nestorian Christianity with overlapping notions of monotheism and a traditional view of Christ as Misicatengrin probably dating back to the Keraite conversion in 1007. In Hulegu's letter Tengrism takes the overarching, non-dogmatic role and contains Nestorianism as a compatible subset, in line with the religious pluralism practiced by the Mongols. Hulegu himself was not strictly a Christian, although his wife, his general Kitbuqa and mother were Nestorians. He was a Tengriist whose Nestorian interests were of the Mongol, syncretic type. His successor Abaqa Khan would take part in the Ninth Crusade with the future King Edward of England in 1271 and also storm the Krak des Chevaliers in February 1281 with the Hospitallers of Margat.\n\nTENGIRSM and ISLAM\n\nTengrism is based on personal relationship with God and spirits and personal experiences, which cannot be fixiated in writings; thus there can be no a prophet, holy scripture, place of worship, clergy, dogma, rite and prayers.[82] In contrast, Islam is based on a written corpus. Doctrines and religious law derive from the Quran and are explained by hadith. In this regard, both belief systems are fundamentally distinct.[83] Turks usually encountered and assimilated their beliefs to Islam via Sufism. Turks probably identified Dervishes as something akin to shamans.[84] First contact between shamanistic Turks and Islam took place during the Battle of Talas against the Chinese Tang dynasty. Turkic Tengrism further influenced parts of Sufism and Folk Islam, especially Alevism with Bektashi Order.[11][83] Many shamanistic beliefs were considered as genuine Islamic by many average Muslims and even prevail today.[85]\n\nIt excludes the experiences of other nations, but offers Semitic history as if it were the history of all humanity. The principle of submission (both in Islam as well as in Christianity) is disregarded as one of the major failings. It allows rich people to abuse the ordinary people and makes human development stagnant. They advocate Turanism and abandonment of Islam as an Arab religion (Nihal Atsiz and others).[50] Prayer from the heart can only be in native language, not Arabic.[87] On the contrary, others assert that Tengri is indeed synonymous with Allah and that Turkic ancestors did not leave their former belief behind, but simply accepted Allah as new expression for Tengri.[88]\n\nOn a scale of complexity Tengrism lies somewhere between the Proto-Indo-European religion (a pre-state form of pastoral shamanism on the western steppe) and its later form the VEDIC religion. The eastern steppe where Tengrism developed had more centralized, hierarchical polities than the western steppe. Tengrism has been noted as more centralized, less polytheistic, less myth-intensive and more historically focused than the paganism that grew out of the western Proto-Indo-European religion. Nonetheless, the chief god Tengri (\"Heaven\") is considered strikingly similar to the Indo-European sky god *Dyeus, and the structure of the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion is closer to that of the early Turks than to the religion of any people of Near Eastern or Mediterranean antiquity.[23]\n\nTENGIRSM and HINDUISM \nThere are lot many similarity found in the ideological believing of Hinduism and TENGIRSM. The people who civilised after Sindhu valley, despite of believing any god or culture were known as Hindus and the majority were the followers of Vedic science and culture. The were distributed in small small divisions on the basis of nature of work and believing of their own god. But initially all follow ultimate power of  all god as Lord shiva a final authority of god ( Devon ke Dev. Mahadev) but that also with time change the small small groups for their priorities of literature and gods. But still the experts of religions make their points clear as base of \u201cSANATAN Religion \u201c is the majority followers of Hindus it follow the 4 VEDAS \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f \n\n'''Article by .
