Burroughs was a primary figure of the [[Beat Generation]] and a major [[Postmodern literature|postmodernist]] author whose influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature. Burroughs wrote eighteen novels and novellas, six collections of short stories and four collections of essays. Five books have been published of his interviews and correspondences. He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians and made many appearances in films. He was also briefly known by the [[pen name]] '''William Lee'''. Burroughs created and exhibited thousands of paintings and other visual artworks, including his celebrated 'Gunshot Paintings'.\n\nHe was born into a wealthy family in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], grandson of the inventor and founder of the [[Burroughs Corporation]], [[William Seward Burroughs I]], and nephew of public relations manager [[Ivy Lee]]. Burroughs began writing essays and journals in early adolescence but did not begin publicizing his writing until his thirties. He left home in 1932 to attend [[Harvard University]], studied English, and [[anthropology]] as a postgraduate, and later attended medical school in Vienna. In 1942 Burroughs enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve during World War II, but was turned down by the [[Office of Strategic Services]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]], after which he picked up the drug addiction that affected him for the rest of his life, while working a variety of jobs. In 1943, while living in New York City, he befriended [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Jack Kerouac]], and out of their mutual influence grew the foundation of the Beat Generation, which was later a defining influence on the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]].\n\nMuch of Burroughs' work is semiautobiographical, primarily drawn from his experiences as a [[heroin]] addict, as he lived throughout [[Mexico City]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and the [[Tangier International Zone]] near [[Morocco]], as well as from his travels in the South American [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. His work also features frequent [[mysticism|mystical]], [[occult]] or otherwise [[Magic (supernatural)|magical]] themes \u2013 a constant preoccupation for Burroughs, both in fiction and in real life.<ref>Stevens, Matthew Levi (2014). The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs. Mandrake of Oxford.</ref><ref>Morgan, Ted (1988). Literary Outlaw. Pimlico.</ref>\n\nBurroughs killed his second wife, [[Joan Vollmer]], in 1951 in Mexico City. Burroughs initially claimed that he shot Vollmer while drunkenly attempting a \"[[William Tell]]\" stunt.<ref>El Nacional, Sept. 8, 1951</ref> He later told investigators a different story: that he had been showing his pistol to friends, when it fell and hit the table, firing the bullet that killed Vollmer.<ref>La Prensa, Sept. 8, 1951</ref> After Burroughs returned to the United States, he was convicted of manslaughter ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', and received a two-year suspended sentence.\n\nBurroughs found success with his confessional first novel, ''[[Junkie (novel)|Junkie]]'' (1953), but he is perhaps best known for his third novel ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' (1959), a highly controversial work that was the subject of a court case after it was challenged as being in violation of the U.S. [[Sodomy laws in the United States|sodomy laws]]. With [[Brion Gysin]], he also popularized the literary [[cut-up technique]] in works such as [[The Nova Trilogy]] (1961\u20131964).\n\nIn 1983, Burroughs was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters|American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]], and in 1984 he was awarded the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by France.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/william-s-burroughs Biography], ''The Guardian''</ref> Jack Kerouac called Burroughs the \"greatest [[Satire|satirical]] writer since [[Jonathan Swift]]\",<ref name=\"harpermodern\">''Naked Lunch: The Restored Text'', Harper Perennial Modern Classics (2005).

[[J. G. Ballard]] considered Burroughs to be \"the most important writer to emerge since the Second World War\", while [[Norman Mailer]] declared him \"the only [[American literature|American writer]] who may be conceivably possessed by genius\".<ref name=\"harpermodern\"/>\n\nBurroughs created visual art throughout his lifetime, but never exhibited it until 1987, after the death of his friend and collaborator [[Brion Gysin]]. For the next and last 10 years of his life, he presented his paintings and drawings at museums and galleries worldwide.\n\nBurroughs had one child, [[William S. Burroughs Jr.]] (1947\u20131981), with his second wife Joan Vollmer. William Burroughs died at his home in [[Lawrence, Kansas]], after suffering a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1997.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nBurroughs was born in 1914, the younger of two sons born to Mortimer Perry Burroughs (June 16, 1885&nbsp;\u2013 January 5, 1965) and Laura Hammon Lee (August 5, 1888&nbsp;\u2013 October 20, 1970). His was a prominent family of [[English American|English ancestry]] in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]. His grandfather, [[William Seward Burroughs I]], founded the Burroughs Adding Machine company, which evolved into the [[Burroughs Corporation]]. Burroughs' mother was the daughter of a minister whose family claimed to be closely related to [[Robert E. Lee]]. His maternal uncle, [[Ivy Lee]], was an advertising pioneer later employed as a publicist for the Rockefellers. His father ran an antique and gift shop, Cobblestone Gardens in St. Louis; and later in [[Palm Beach, Florida]] when they relocated.\n\nIt was during his childhood that Burroughs' developed a lifelong interest in [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]] and the [[occult]] \u2013 topics which would find their way into his work repeatedly across the years.<ref>\"'''TV:''' So much of your work deals with the juncture between science and mystery, it seems. I mean there've been references to Orgone boxes, and Scientology, and Castaneda, it just goes on and on ... how did you get interested in this sort of area? '''WB:''' Always was. I always was involved in that area from my early childhood. I was always interested in the occult and the mysterious ... just a life-long preoccupation.\" \u2013 William S. Burroughs, interviewed by Tom Vitali, 26th Nov 1986. Transcript published as ''A Moveable Feast'' in ''Burroughs Live: The Collected Interviews of William S. Burroughs 1960-1977. 2001.</ref> Burroughs later described how he saw an apparition of a green reindeer in the woods as a child, which he identified as a [[totem|totem animal]],<ref>\"When I was four years old I saw a vision in Forest Park, St. Louis ... I was lagging behind and I saw a little green reindeer about the size of a cat ... Later, when I studied anthropology at Harvard, I learned that this was a totem animal vision and knew that I could never kill a reindeer.\" \u2013 William S. Burroughs, ''The Cat Inside''. Viking. 1992.</ref> as well as a vision of ghostly grey figures at play in his bedroom.<ref>\"I was subject to hallucinations as a child. Once I woke up in the early morning light and saw little men playing in a block house I had made. I felt no fear, only a feeling of stillness and wonder.\" \u2013 William S. Burroughs, prologue, ''Junky''. Penguin. 1977.</ref>\n\nAs a boy, Burroughs lived on Pershing Avenue (now Pershing Place) in St. Louis' [[Central West End, St. Louis|Central West End]]. He attended [[John Burroughs School]] in St. Louis where his first published essay, \"Personal Magnetism\" \u2013 which revolved around telepathic mind-control \u2013 was printed in the ''John Burroughs Review'' in 1929.<ref>[http://www.popsubculture.com/pop/bio_project/william_s_burroughs.html William S Burroughs] Popsubculture.com Biography.</ref> He then attended the [[Los Alamos Ranch School]] in New Mexico, which was stressful for him. The school was a [[boarding school]] for the wealthy, \"where the spindly sons of the rich could be transformed into manly specimens\".<ref>Morgan, Ted, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 44.</ref> Burroughs kept [[diary|journals]] documenting an erotic attachment to another boy. According to his own account, he destroyed these later, ashamed of their content.<ref name=\"Word Virus 2000, p. 21\">''Word Virus: The William S. Burroughs Reader''. James Grauerholz, Ira Silverberg, Ann Douglas (eds), Grove Press, 2000, p. 21.</ref> He kept his sexual orientation concealed from his family well into adulthood, due to the context in which he grew up and from which he fled\u2014that is, a \"family where displays of affection were considered embarrassing\".<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 26.</ref> He became a well-known homosexual writer after the publication of ''Naked Lunch'' in 1959. Some {{Who| date=November 2011}} say that he was expelled from Los Alamos after taking [[chloral hydrate]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] with a fellow student. Yet, according to his own account, he left voluntarily: \"During the Easter vacation of my second year I persuaded my family to let me stay in St. Louis.\"<ref name=\"Word Virus 2000, p. 21\" />\n\n[[File:William S. Burroughs' childhood home .jpg|thumb|William S. Burroughs' childhood home on Pershing Place in St. Louis]]\n\n===Harvard University===\n\nBurroughs finished high school at Taylor School in [[Clayton, Missouri]], and in 1932 left home to pursue an arts degree at [[Harvard University]], where he was affiliated with [[Adams House (Harvard University)|Adams House]]. During the summers, he worked as a cub reporter for the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', covering the police docket. He disliked the work, and refused to cover some events, like the death of a drowned child. He lost his virginity in an [[East St. Louis, Illinois]] brothel that summer with a female prostitute whom he regularly patronized.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', papers, p. 62.</ref> While at Harvard, Burroughs made trips to New York City and was introduced to the gay subculture there. He visited lesbian dives, piano bars, and the [[Harlem]] and [[Greenwich Village]] homosexual underground with Richard Stern, a wealthy friend from [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. They would drive from Boston to New York in a reckless fashion. Once, Stern scared Burroughs so badly that he asked to be let out of the vehicle.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 611.</ref>\n\nBurroughs graduated from Harvard in 1936. According to Ted Morgan's ''Literary Outlaw'',\n\n<blockquote>His parents, upon his graduation, had decided to give him a monthly allowance of $200 out of their earnings from Cobblestone Gardens, a substantial sum in those days. It was enough to keep him going, and indeed it guaranteed his survival for the next twenty-five years, arriving with welcome regularity. The allowance was a ticket to freedom; it allowed him to live where he wanted to and to forgo employment.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 65.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBurroughs' parents sold the rights to his grandfather's invention and had no share in the [[Burroughs Corporation]]. Shortly before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]], they sold their stock for $200,000 (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|200000|1929|r=0}}}} in today's funds{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref name=NYTobit>{{cite news |title = William S.

He traveled to Europe and became involved in Austrian and Hungarian [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]]-era [[LGBT culture]]; he picked up young men in steam baths in Vienna and moved in a circle of exiles, homosexuals, and runaways. There, he met Ilse Klapper, n\u00e9e Herzfeld (1900\u20131982), a [[Jews|Jewish]] woman fleeing the country's [[Nazism|Nazi]] government.<ref name=\"Lawlor\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=MMZqLXP01e4C |title=Beat Culture: Lifestyles, Icons, and Impact|last=Lawlor|first=William|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781851094004|location=|pages=29|language=en}}</ref> The two were never romantically involved, but Burroughs married her, in [[Croatia]], against the wishes of his parents, to allow her to gain a visa to the United States. She made her way to New York City, and eventually divorced Burroughs, although they remained friends for many years.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', pp. 65\u20138.</ref> After returning to the United States, he held a string of uninteresting jobs. In 1939, his mental health became a concern for his parents, especially after he deliberately severed the last joint of his left little finger at the knuckle to impress a man with whom he was infatuated.<ref>Grauerholz, James. Introduction p. xv, in William Burroughs. ''Interzone''. New York: Viking Press, 1987.</ref> This event made its way into his early fiction as the [[short story]] \"The Finger.\"\n\n==Beginning of the Beats==\n\nBurroughs enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] early in 1942, shortly after the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]] brought the United States into [[World War II]]. But when he was classified as a 1-A Infantry, not an officer, he became dejected. His mother recognized her son's depression and got Burroughs a civilian disability discharge&nbsp;\u2014a release from duty based on the premise that he should have not been allowed to enlist due to previous mental instability. After being evaluated by a family friend, who was also a neurologist at a psychiatric treatment center, Burroughs waited five months in limbo at [[Jefferson Barracks]] outside St. Louis before being discharged. During that time he met a Chicago soldier also awaiting release, and once Burroughs was free, he moved to Chicago and held a variety of jobs, including one as an [[Pest control|exterminator]]. When two of his friends from St. Louis, [[Lucien Carr]], a [[University of Chicago]] student, and David Kammerer, Carr's admirer, left for New York City, Burroughs followed.\n\n===Joan Vollmer===\n\nIn 1944, Burroughs began living with [[Joan Vollmer|Joan Vollmer Adams]] in an apartment they shared with [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[Edie Parker]], Kerouac's first wife.<ref name=\"The Voice Is All\">{{cite book |title = The Voice Is All: The Lonely Victory of Jack Kerouac |publisher = Penguin Group |author = Johnson, Joyce |year = 2012 |isbn = 9780670025107 }}</ref> Vollmer Adams was married to a [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] with whom she had a young daughter, Julie Adams. Burroughs and Kerouac got into trouble with the law for failing to report a murder involving [[Lucien Carr]], who had killed David Kammerer in a confrontation over Kammerer's incessant and unwanted advances. This incident inspired Burroughs and Kerouac to collaborate on a novel titled ''[[And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks]]'', completed in 1945. The two fledgling authors were unable to get it published, but the manuscript was eventually published in November 2008 by [[Grove Press]] and [[Penguin Books]].\n\nDuring this time, Burroughs began using [[morphine]] and became [[Addiction|addicted]]. He eventually sold [[heroin]] in [[Greenwich Village]] to support his habit. Vollmer also became an addict, but her drug of choice was [[Benzedrine]], an [[amphetamine]] sold over the counter at that time.  Because of her addiction and social circle, her husband immediately divorced her after returning from the war. With urging from [[Allen Ginsberg]], and also perhaps Kerouac, Burroughs became intellectually and emotionally linked with Vollmer and by the summer of 1945 had moved in with Vollmer and her daughter. In spring 1946, Burroughs was arrested for forging a narcotics prescription. Vollmer asked her psychiatrist, a Dr. Wollberg, to sign a surety bond for Burroughs' release. As part of his release, Burroughs returned to St. Louis under his parents' care, after which he left for Mexico to get a divorce from Ilse Klapper. Meanwhile, Vollmer's addiction led to a temporary psychosis that resulted in her admission to  [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]], which endangered the custody of her child. Upon hearing this, Burroughs immediately returned to New York City to gain her release, asking her to marry him. Their marriage was never formalized, but she lived as his [[Common-law marriage|common-law wife]]. They returned to St. Louis to visit Burroughs' parents and then moved with her daughter to Texas.<ref name=word_virus>{{cite book |last1 = Grauerholz |first1 = James |last2 = Silverberg |first2 = Ira |title = Word Virus: The William S.

Vollmer's daughter, Julie Adams, went to live with her grandmother, and William S. Burroughs Jr. went to St. Louis to live with his grandparents. Burroughs reported every Monday morning to the jail in Mexico City while his prominent Mexican attorney worked to resolve the case. According to [[James Grauerholz]], two witnesses had agreed to testify that the gun had fired accidentally while he was checking to see if it was loaded, with ballistics experts bribed to support this story.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 202.</ref> Nevertheless, the trial was continuously delayed and Burroughs began to write what would eventually become the short novel ''[[Queer (novel)|Queer]]'' while awaiting his trial. Upon Burroughs' attorney fleeing Mexico in light of his own legal problems, Burroughs decided, according to [[Ted Morgan (writer)|Ted Morgan]], to \"skip\" and return to the United States. He was convicted [[Trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] of homicide and was given a two-year suspended sentence.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 214.</ref>\n\nAlthough Burroughs was writing before the shooting of Joan Vollmer, this event marked him and, biographers argue, his work for the rest of his life.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', pp. 197\u2013198.</ref> Vollmer's death also resonated with [[Allen Ginsberg]], who wrote of her in ''Dream Record: June 8, 1955,'' \"Joan, what kind of knowledge have the dead? can you still love your mortal acquaintances? What do you remember of us?\"\n\n====''The Yage Letters''====\n\nAfter leaving Mexico, Burroughs drifted through South America for several months, seeking out a drug called [[Ayahuasca|yag\u00e9]], which promised to give the user [[Telepathy|telepathic]] abilities. A book composed of letters between Burroughs and Ginsberg, ''[[The Yage Letters]],'' was published in 1963 by [[City Lights Bookstore|City Lights Books]]. In 2006, a re-edited version, ''The Yage Letters Redux'', showed that the letters were largely fictionalised from Burroughs' notes.\n\n==Beginning of literary career==\nBurroughs described Vollmer's death as a pivotal event in his life, and one which provoked his writing by exposing him to the risk of [[Spirit possession|possession]] by a malevolent entity he called \"the Ugly Spirit\":\n\n<blockquote>I am forced to the appalling conclusion that I would never have become a writer but for Joan's death, and to a realization of the extent to which this event has motivated and formulated my writing. I live with the constant threat of possession, and a constant need to escape from possession, from Control. So the death of Joan brought me in contact with the invader, the Ugly Spirit, and maneuvered me into a life long struggle, in which I have had no choice except to write my way out.<ref name=\"Queer, Penguin 1985\">''Queer'', Penguin, 1985, p. xxiii.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs Burroughs makes clear, he meant this reference to \"possession\" to be taken absolutely literally, stating: \"My concept of possession is closer to the medieval model than to modern psychological explanations ... I mean a definite possessing entity.\"<ref name=\"Queer, Penguin 1985\"/> Burroughs' writing was intended as a form of \"sorcery\", in his own words<ref name=\"levistevens1\">Stevens, Matthew Levi. ''The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs.'' p.125.</ref> - to disrupt language via methods such as the [[cut-up technique]], and thus protect himself from possession.<ref name=\"levistevens2\">\"When Gysin, apparently in trance, told Burroughs 'The Ugly Spirit shot Joan because' he thought he finally had the answer ... the unforgiveable slip that had caused the death of his common-law wife, Joan Vollmer ... had come about because he was literally ''possessed'' by an evil spirit ... William instinctively knew the only solution available to him ... If the Word was indeed the basic mechanism of control - the 'virus' by which The Ugly Spirit, or its agency Control, exerted its malevolent influence - then surely a real understanding of the Word, what words are and what can be done with them - was essential. All these explorations and obsessions were not merely diversions, experiments for artistic or literary amusement ... but part of a deadly struggle with unseen, invisible - perhaps evil - psycho-spiritual enemies.\" \u2013 Stevens, Matthew Levi.

In any case, he had begun to write in 1945. Burroughs and Kerouac collaborated on ''[[And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks]]'', a mystery novel loosely based on the Carr/Kammerer situation and that at the time remained unpublished. Years later, in the documentary ''What Happened to Kerouac?'', Burroughs described it as \"not a very distinguished work\".

Due to legal problems, he was unable to live in the cities toward which he was most inclined. He spent time with his parents in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], and New York City with Allen Ginsberg. When Ginsberg refused his romantic advances,<ref>Bill Morgan, ''I Celebrate Myself'', 2006, New York: Viking Press, p. 159.</ref> Burroughs went to Rome to meet [[Alan Ansen]] on a vacation financed from his parents' continuing support. He found Rome and Ansen's company dreary, and inspired by [[Paul Bowles]]' fiction, he decided to head for the [[Tangier International Zone]],<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', pp. 232\u201334.</ref> where he rented a room and began to write a large body of text that he personally referred to as ''[[Interzone (book)|Interzone]]''.<ref>[[James Grauerholz]] writes, in ''Interzone'', the body of text that Burroughs was working on was called ''Interzone'', see Burroughs, William S. ''[[Interzone (book)|Interzone]]''. \"Introduction\", pp. ix\u2013xiii. New York: Viking Press, 1987.</ref>\n\nTo Burroughs, all signs directed a return to Tangier, a city where drugs were freely available and where financial support from his family would continue. He realized that in the Moroccan culture he had found an environment that synchronized with his temperament and afforded no hindrances to pursuing his interests and indulging in his chosen activities. He left for Tangier in November 1954 and spent the next four years there working on the fiction that would later become ''Naked Lunch'', as well as attempting to write commercial articles about Tangier. He sent these writings to Ginsberg, his literary agent for ''Junkie'', but none was published until 1989 when ''Interzone'', a collection of short stories, was published. Under the strong influence of a [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] confection known as [[majoun]] and a German-made [[opioid]] called  [[oxycodone|Eukodol]], Burroughs settled in to write. Eventually, Ginsberg and Kerouac, who had traveled to Tangier in 1957, helped Burroughs type, edit, and arrange these episodes into ''Naked Lunch''.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'',  pp. 238\u201342.</ref>\n\n===''Naked Lunch''===\n{{further|Naked Lunch}}\nWhereas ''Junkie'' and ''Queer'' were conventional in style, ''Naked Lunch'' was his first venture into a [[Nonlinear narrative|nonlinear]] style. After the publication of ''Naked Lunch'', a book whose creation was to a certain extent the result of a series of contingencies, Burroughs was exposed to [[Brion Gysin]]'s [[cut-up technique]] at the [[Beat Hotel]] in Paris in October 1959. He began slicing up phrases and words to create new sentences.<ref>Miles, Barry \"The Inventive Mind of Brion Gysin\" in Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9rez Kuri (ed) ''Brion Gysin: Tuning in to the Multimedia Age'', London: Thames and Hudson, 2003, p.124-125.</ref> At the Beat Hotel Burroughs discovered \"a port of entry\" into Gysin's canvases: \"I don't think I had ever seen painting until I saw the painting of Brion Gysin.\"<ref>Burroughs, William S., ''Ports of Entry \u2013 Here is Space-Time Painting'', p.32.</ref> The two would cultivate a long-term friendship that revolved around a mutual interest in artworks and cut-up techniques. Scenes were slid together with little care for [[narrative]]. Perhaps thinking of his crazed physician, Dr. Benway, he described ''Naked Lunch'' as a book that could be cut into at any point. Although not considered [[science fiction]], the book does seem to forecast [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], [[liposuction]], and the [[crack cocaine|crack]] pandemic.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 355.</ref>\n\nExcerpts from ''Naked Lunch'' were first published in the United States in 1958. The novel was initially rejected by City Lights Books, the publisher of Ginsberg's ''[[Howl]]''; and [[Olympia Press]] publisher [[Maurice Girodias]], who had published English-language novels in France that were controversial for their subjective views of sex and antisocial characters. But Allen Ginsberg managed to get excerpts published in ''[[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain Review]]'' and ''[[Chicago Review]]'' in 1958. [[Irving Rosenthal (writer)|Irving Rosenthal]], student editor of ''Chicago Review'', a quarterly journal partially subsidized by the university, promised to publish more excerpts from ''Naked Lunch'', but he was fired from his position in 1958 after ''Chicago Daily News'' columnist [[Jack Mabley]] called the first excerpt obscene. Rosenthal went on to publish more in his newly created literary journal ''[[Big Table (journal)|Big Table]] No. 1''; however, the [[United States Postmaster General]] ruled that copies could not be mailed to subscribers on the basis of obscenity laws. [[John Ciardi]] did get a copy and wrote a positive review of the work, prompting a telegram from Allen Ginsberg praising the review.<ref>Ginsberg, Allen. Postcard to John Ciardi. July 11, 1959. MS. Stuart Wright Collection: Richard Ghormley Eberhart Papers. Joyner Lib., Greenville, North Carolina.</ref> This controversy made ''Naked Lunch'' interesting to Girodias again, and he published the novel in 1959.{{Citation needed|date= November 2011}}\n\nAfter the novel was published, it slowly became notorious across Europe and the United States, garnering interest from not just members of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], but also literary critics such as [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]]. Once published in the United States, ''Naked Lunch'' was prosecuted as [[obscenity|obscene]] by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, followed by other states. In 1966, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] declared the work \"not obscene\" on the basis of criteria developed largely to defend the book. The case against Burroughs' novel still stands as the last obscenity trial against a work of literature\u2014that is, a work consisting of words only, and not including illustrations or photographs\u2014prosecuted in the United States.\n\nThe ''Word Hoard'', the collection of manuscripts that produced ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', also produced parts of the later works ''[[The Soft Machine]]'' (1961), ''[[The Ticket That Exploded]]'' (1962), and ''[[Nova Express]]'' (1964). These novels feature extensive use of the cut-up technique that influenced all of Burroughs' subsequent fiction to a degree. During Burroughs' friendship and artistic collaborations with Brion Gysin and [[Ian Sommerville (technician)|Ian Sommerville]], the technique was combined with images, Gysin's paintings, and sound, via Somerville's tape recorders. Burroughs was so dedicated to the cut-up method that he often defended his use of the technique before editors and publishers, most notably Dick Seaver at [[Grove Press]] in the 1960s<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 425.</ref> and [[Holt McDougal|Holt, Rinehart & Winston]] in the 1980s. The cut-up method, because of its random or mechanical basis for text generation, combined with the possibilities of mixing in text written by other writers, deemphasizes the traditional role of the writer as creator or originator of a string of words, while simultaneously exalting the importance of the writer's sensibility as an editor. In this sense, the cut-up method may be considered as analogous to the [[collage]] method in the visual arts. New restored editions of [[The Nova Trilogy]] (or Cut-Up Trilogy), edited by [[Oliver Harris]] (President of the [[European Beat Studies Network]]) and published in 2014, included notes and materials to reveal the care with which Burroughs used his methods and the complex histories of his manuscripts.\n\n===Paris and the \"Beat Hotel\"===\nBurroughs moved into a rundown hotel in the [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Latin Quarter]] of Paris in 1959 when ''Naked Lunch'' was still looking for a publisher. [[Tangier]], with its political unrest, and criminals with whom he had become involved, became dangerous to Burroughs.<ref>Grauerholz, James. Introduction p. xviii, in William Burroughs. ''Interzone''. New York: Viking Press, 1987.</ref> He went to Paris to meet Ginsberg and talk with [[Olympia Press]]. He left behind a criminal charge which eventually caught up with him in Paris. Paul Lund, a British former career criminal and cigarette smuggler whom Burroughs met in Tangier, was arrested on suspicion of importing narcotics into France. Lund gave up Burroughs, and evidence implicated Burroughs in the importation of narcotics into France. When the Moroccan authorities forwarded their investigation to French officials, Burroughs faced criminal charges in Paris for conspiracy to import opiates. It was during this impending case that [[Maurice Girodias]] published ''Naked Lunch''; its appearance helped to get Burroughs a suspended sentence, since a literary career, according to Ted Morgan, is a respected profession in France.\n\nThe \"[[Beat Hotel]]\" was a typical European-style [[boarding house]] hotel, with common toilets on every floor, and a small place for personal cooking in the room. Life there was documented by the photographer [[Harold Chapman]], who lived in the attic room. This shabby, inexpensive hotel was populated by [[Gregory Corso]], Ginsberg and [[Peter Orlovsky]] for several months after ''Naked Lunch'' first appeared.\n\nBurroughs' time at the Beat Hotel was dominated by occult experiments \u2013 \"[[mirror-gazing]], [[scrying]], [[trance]] and [[telepathy]], all fuelled by a wide variety of mind-altering drugs\".<ref name=\"levistevens3\">Stevens, Matthew Levi. ''The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs.'' p.50.</ref> Later, Burroughs would describe \"visions\" obtained by staring into the mirror for hours at a time \u2013 his hands transformed into tentacles,<ref>\"Once I looked in a mirror and saw my hands completely inhuman, thick, black-pink, fibrous, long white tendrils growing from the curiously abbreviated finger-tips as if the finger have been cut off to make way for tendrils.\" \u2013 William S.

Viking Penguin, 1993.</ref> It was from this febrile atmosphere that the famous [[cut-up technique]] emerged.\n\nThe actual process by which ''Naked Lunch'' was published was partly a function of its \"cut-up\" presentation to the printer. Girodias had given Burroughs only ten days to prepare the manuscript for print galleys, and Burroughs sent over the manuscript in pieces, preparing the parts in no particular order. When it was published in this authentically random manner, Burroughs liked it better than the initial plan. International rights to the work were sold soon after, and Burroughs used the $3,000 advance from [[Grove Press]] to buy drugs (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3000|1959|r=-3}}}} in today's funds{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p.316-326.</ref> ''Naked Lunch'' was featured in a 1959 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine cover story, partly as an article that highlighted the growing Beat literary movement. During this time Burroughs found an outlet for material otherwise rendered unpublishable in [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s ''[[My Own Mag]]''.<ref>[http://realitystudio.org/bibliographic-bunker/my-own-mag/ Reports from the Bibliographic Bunker: Jed Birmingham on William S. Burroughs Collecting]</ref> Also, poetry by Burroughs' appeared in the [[avant garde]] [[little magazine]] [[Nomad (magazine)|''Nomad'']] at the beginning of the 1960s.\n\n===The London years===\nBurroughs left Paris for London in 1960 to visit Dr. Dent, a well-known English medical doctor who spearheaded a reputedly painless heroin withdrawal treatment using the drug [[apomorphine]].<ref>Dent, John Yerbury. ''Anxiety and Its Treatment''. London: J. Murray, 1941.</ref> Dent's apomorphine cure was also used to treat alcoholism, although it was held by several people who undertook it to be no more than straightforward aversion therapy. Burroughs however was convinced. Following his first cure, he wrote a detailed appreciation of apomorphine and other cures, which he submitted to ''The British Journal of Addiction'' (Vol. 53, 1956) under the title \"Letter From A Master Addict To Dangerous Drugs\"; this letter is appended to many editions of ''Naked Lunch''.\n\nThough he ultimately relapsed, Burroughs ended up working out of London for six years, traveling back to the United States on several occasions, including one time escorting his son to the [[Federal Medical Center, Lexington|Lexington Narcotics Farm and Prison]] after the younger Burroughs had been convicted of prescription fraud in [[Florida]]. In the \"Afterword\" to the compilation of his son's two previously published novels ''Speed'' and ''Kentucky Ham'', Burroughs writes that he thought he had a \"small habit\" and left London quickly without any narcotics because he suspected the U.S. customs would search him very thoroughly on arrival. He claims he went through the most excruciating two months of opiate withdrawal while seeing his son through his trial and sentencing, traveling with Billy to [[Lexington, Kentucky]] from [[Miami]] to ensure that his son entered the hospital that he had once spent time in as a volunteer admission.<ref>Burroughs, William, S. \"Afterword\". ''Speed/Kentucky Ham: Two Novels''. New York: Overlook Press, 1984.</ref> Earlier, Burroughs revisited St. Louis, Missouri, taking a large advance from ''[[Playboy]]'' to write an article about his trip back to St. Louis, one that was eventually published in ''[[The Paris Review]]'', after Burroughs refused to alter the style for ''Playboy'''s publishers. In 1968 Burroughs joined [[Jean Genet]], [[John Sack]], and [[Terry Southern]] in covering the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine. Southern and Burroughs, who had first become acquainted in London, would remain lifelong friends and collaborators. In 1972, Burroughs and Southern unsuccessfully attempted to adapt ''Naked Lunch'' for the screen in conjunction with American game-show producer [[Chuck Barris]].<ref>Lee Hill ''A Grand Guy: The Art and Life of Terry Southern''.</ref>\n\nBurroughs supported himself and his addiction by publishing pieces in small literary presses. His avant-garde reputation grew internationally as hippies and college students discovered his earlier works. He developed a close friendship with [[Antony Balch]] and lived with a young hustler named John Brady who continuously brought home young women despite Burroughs' protestations. In the midst of this personal turmoil, Burroughs managed to complete two works: a novel written in [[screenplay]] format, ''[[The Last Words of Dutch Schultz]]'' (1969); and the traditional prose-format novel ''[[The Wild Boys (novel)|The Wild Boys]]'' (1971).\n\nIt was during his time in London that Burroughs began using his \"[[Playback (technique)|playback]]\" technique in an attempt to place [[curses]] on various people and places who had drawn his ire, including the Moka coffee bar<ref name=P-Orridge2>[[#refP-Orridge2|P-Orridge, Genesis. ''Magick Squares and Future Beats'']]</ref><ref>\"William continued going to the bar for a few more days, enduring their abuse, while he tape recorded the sounds inside. Later, he would stand outside and film or photograph the premises from outside. THen he went back n and began to play the tape recordings at low or subliminal levels, and continued to take photographs on his way in and out of the place ... The effects were remarkable: accidents occurred, fights broke out, the place lost customers, the subsequent loss of income became irredeemable, and within a few weeks, the bar was permanently closed.\" \u2013 Cabell McLean, ''Playback: My Experience of Chaos Magic with William S. Burroughs, Sr.'' Ashe Journal of Experimental Spirituality, Vol.2 Issue 3. 2003.</ref> and the London HQ of Scientology.<ref name=\"levistevens4\">\" ... Burroughs also made similarly sorcerous attempts that same year against the London HQ of Scientology at 37 Fitzroy Street. Although he considered it another success when they closed down, he seemed unable to bring any 'playback' influence to bear on their new location in Tottenham Court Road.\" \u2013 Stevens, Matthew Levi. ''The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs.'' p.129.</ref> Burroughs himself related the Moka coffee bar incident:\n\n<blockquote>Here is a sample operation carried out against the Moka Bar at 29 Frith Street, London, W1, beginning on August 3, 1972. Reverse Thursday. Reason for operation was outrageous and unprovoked discourtesy and poisonous cheesecake. Now to close in on the Moka Bar. Record. Take pictures. Stand around outside. Let them see me. They are seething around in there ... Playback would come later with more pictures ... Playback was carried out a number of times with more pictures. Their business fell off. They kept shorter and shorter hours. October 30, 1972, the Moka Bar closed. The location was taken over by the Queen's Snack Bar.<ref>William S. Burroughs, ''Playback From Eden to Watergate'', published in ''The Job''. John Calder Ltd.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the 1960s, Burroughs joined and then left the [[Church of Scientology]]. In talking about the experience, he claimed that the techniques and philosophy of Scientology helped him and that he felt that further study of Scientology would produce great results.<ref>[http://www.beatdom.com/?p=1373 David S. Wills, \"The Weird Cult: William S. Burroughs and Scientology\",] ''Beatdom Literary Journal'', December 2011.</ref> He was skeptical of the organization itself, and felt that it fostered an environment that did not accept critical discussion.<ref>[http://www.suburbia.com.au/~fun/scn/etc/wsb3.html Burroughs on Scientology], ''Los Angeles Free Press'', March 6, 1970.</ref> His subsequent critical writings about the church and his review of ''[[Inside Scientology: How I Joined Scientology and Became Superhuman|Inside Scientology]]'' by [[Robert Kaufman]] led to a battle of letters between Burroughs and Scientology supporters in the pages of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.\n\n==Return to United States==\nIn 1974, concerned about his friend's well-being, Allen Ginsberg gained for Burroughs a contract to teach [[creative writing]] at the [[City College of New York]]. Burroughs successfully withdrew from heroin use and moved to New York. He eventually found an apartment, affectionately dubbed \"The Bunker\", on the [[Lower East Side]] of Manhattan at 222 Bowery.<ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/222+Bowery,+New+York,+NY+10012/@40.7220402,-73.993453,3a,60y,292.52h,88.5t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssstm2M9ZCupP7EW9Q_4vPQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25985e2404163:0x9613dc038516de20!8m2!3d40.7221412!4d-73.9937417!6m1!1e1?hl=en  Google street view: 222 Bowery]</ref> The dwelling was a partially converted [[YMCA]] gym, complete with lockers and communal showers. The building fell within New York City [[rent control]] policies that made it extremely cheap; it was only about four hundred dollars a month until 1981 when the rent control rules changed, doubling the rent overnight.<ref>Bockris, Victor. ''With William Burroughs: A Report From the Bunker''. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1996.</ref> Burroughs added \"teacher\" to the list of jobs he did not like, as he lasted only a semester as a professor; he found the students uninteresting and without much creative talent. Although he needed income desperately, he turned down a teaching position at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] for $15,000 a semester. \"The teaching gig was a lesson in never again. You were giving out all this energy and nothing was coming back.\"<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 477.</ref> His savior was the newly arrived twenty-one-year-old bookseller and Beat Generation devotee [[James Grauerholz]], who worked for Burroughs part-time as a secretary as well as in a [[bookstore]]. Grauerholz suggested the idea of reading tours. Grauerholz had managed several rock bands in Kansas and took the lead in booking for Burroughs reading tours that would help support him throughout the next two decades. It raised his public profile, eventually aiding in his obtaining new publishing contracts. Through Grauerholz, Burroughs became a monthly columnist for the noted popular culture magazine ''[[Crawdaddy]]'', for which he interviewed [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[Jimmy Page]] in 1975. Burroughs decided to relocate back to the United States permanently in 1976. He then began to associate with New York cultural players such as [[Andy Warhol]], [[John Giorno]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Patti Smith]], and [[Susan Sontag]], frequently entertaining them at the Bunker; he also visited venues like [[CBGB]] to watch the likes of Patti Smith perform.<ref>[http://kevinegperry.com/2014/02/05/william-s-burroughs-at-100-thurston-moore-on-seeing-him-watch-patti-smith-at-cbgb-his-response-to-kurt-cobains-suicide-and-cut-up-songwriting/ Thurston Moore interview on William Burroughs]</ref> Throughout early 1977, Burroughs collaborated with Southern and [[Dennis Hopper]] on a screen adaptation of ''Junky''. Financed by a reclusive acquaintance of Burroughs, the project lost traction after financial problems and creative disagreements between Hopper and Burroughs.\n\nOrganized by Columbia professor [[Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer]], Giorno, and Grauerholz, the Nova Convention was a multimedia retrospective of Burroughs' work held from November 30 to December 2, 1978, at various locations throughout New York. The event included readings from Southern, Ginsberg, Smith, and [[Frank Zappa]] (who filled in at the last minute for [[Keith Richards]], then entangled in a legal problem), in addition to panel discussions with [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and concerts featuring [[The B-52's]], [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], [[Philip Glass]], and [[Debbie Harry]] and [[Chris Stein]].\n\nIn 1976, [[William S. Burroughs Jr.|Billy Burroughs]] was eating dinner with his father and Allen Ginsberg in [[Boulder, Colorado]], at Ginsberg's [[Buddhist]] poetry school ([[Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics]]) at [[Chogyam Trungpa]]'s [[Naropa University]] when he began to vomit blood. Burroughs senior had not seen his son for over a year and was alarmed at his appearance when Billy arrived at Ginsberg's apartment. Although Billy had successfully published two short novels in the 1970s, and was deemed by literary critics like [[Ann Charters]] as a bona fide \"second generation beat writer\",<ref>Charters, Ann. \"Introduction\". ''Speed/Kentucky Ham: Two Novels''. New York: Overlook Press, 1984.</ref> his brief marriage to a teenage waitress had disintegrated. Billy was a constant drinker, and there were long periods when he was out of contact with any of his family or friends. The diagnosis was [[liver cirrhosis]] so complete that the only treatment was a rarely performed liver transplant operation. Fortunately, the [[University of Colorado Health Sciences Center|University of Colorado Medical Center]] was one of two places in the nation that performed transplants under the pioneering work of Dr. [[Thomas Starzl]]. Billy underwent the procedure and beat the thirty-percent survival odds. His father spent time in 1976 and 1977 in Colorado, helping Billy through additional surgeries and complications. Ted Morgan's biography asserts that their relationship was not spontaneous and lacked real warmth or intimacy. Allen Ginsberg was supportive to both Burroughs and his son throughout the long period of recovery.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', pp. 495\u2013536.</ref>\n\nIn London, Burroughs had begun to write what would become the first novel of a trilogy, published as ''[[Cities of the Red Night]]'' (1981), ''[[The Place of Dead Roads]]'' (1983), and ''[[The Western Lands]]'' (1987). Grauerholz helped edit ''Cities'' when it was first rejected by Burroughs' long-time editor Dick Seaver at Holt Rinehart, after it was deemed too disjointed. The novel was written as a straight narrative and then chopped up into a more random pattern, leaving the reader to sort through the characters and events. This technique differed from the author's earlier cut-up methods, which were accidental from the start. Nevertheless, the novel was reassembled and published, still without a straight linear form, but with fewer breaks in the story. The trilogy featured time-travel adventures in which Burroughs' narrators rewrote episodes from history to reform mankind.<ref name=\"morgan565\">Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 565.</ref> Reviews were mixed for ''Cities''. Novelist and critic [[Anthony Burgess]] panned the work in ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'', saying Burroughs was boring readers with repetitive episodes of [[Pederasty|pederast]] fantasy and sexual strangulation that lacked any comprehensible [[world view]] or [[theology]]; other reviewers, like [[J. G. Ballard]], argued that Burroughs was shaping a new literary \"mythography\".<ref name=\"morgan565\" />\n\nIn 1981, Billy Burroughs died in Florida. He had cut off contact with his father several years before, even publishing an article in ''Esquire'' magazine claiming his father had poisoned his life and revealing that he had been molested as a fourteen-year-old by one of his father's friends while visiting Tangier. The [[Liver transplantation|liver transplant]] had not cured his urge to drink, and Billy suffered from serious health complications years after the operation. After he had stopped taking his [[immunosuppressive drug|transplant rejection drugs]], he was found near the side of a Florida highway by a stranger. He died shortly afterward. Burroughs was in New York when he heard from Allen Ginsberg of Billy's death.\n\nBurroughs, by 1979, was once again addicted to [[heroin]]. The cheap heroin that was easily purchased outside his door on the Lower East Side \"made its way\" into his veins, coupled with \"gifts\" from the overzealous if well-intentioned admirers who frequently visited the Bunker. Although Burroughs would have episodes of being free from heroin, from this point until his death he was regularly addicted to the drug. He died in 1997 on a [[methadone]] maintenance program. In an introduction to ''[[Last Words: The Final Journals of William S. Burroughs]]'', James Grauerholz (who managed Burroughs' reading tours in the 1980s and 1990s) mentions that part of his job was to deal with the \"underworld\" in each city to secure the author's needed drugs.<ref>Burroughs, William. \"Introduction\". ''Last Words: The Final Journals of William S. Burroughs''. New York: Grove Press, 2000.</ref>\n\n===Later years in Kansas===\n[[File:WilliamBurroughsinLawrence.png|thumb|upright|William S. Burroughs and James Grauerholz in the alley behind the Jazzhaus in Lawrence, Kansas (1996)]]\nBurroughs moved to [[Lawrence, Kansas]] in 1981, taking up residence at 1927 Learnard Avenue where he would spend the rest of his life. He once told a Wichita Eagle reporter that he was content to live in Kansas, saying, \"The thing I like about Kansas is that it's not nearly as violent, and it's a helluva lot cheaper. And I can get out in the country and fish and shoot and whatnot.\"<ref>[http://www.kansas.com/2010/04/05/1255296/godfather-of-beat-generation-was.html \"Godfather of Beat Generation was content to live last days in Kansas\"], ''Wichita Eagle and Kansas.com'', April 5, 2010.</ref> In 1984, he signed a seven-book deal with [[Viking Press]] after he signed with literary agent Andrew Wylie. This deal included the publication rights to the unpublished 1952 novel ''[[Queer (novel)|Queer]]''. With this money he purchased a small bungalow for $29,000.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 596.</ref> He was finally inducted into the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters|American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]] in 1983 after several attempts by Allen Ginsberg to get him accepted. He attended the induction ceremony in May 1983. [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] remarked the induction of Burroughs into the Academy proved [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s point that capitalistic society had a great ability to incorporate its one-time outsiders.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 577.</ref>\n\nBy this point, Burroughs was a counterculture icon. In his final years, he cultivated an entourage of young friends who replaced his aging contemporaries. He inspired 1970s [[proto-punk]] rock band [[Doctors of Madness]]. In the 1980s he collaborated with performers ranging from [[Bill Laswell]]'s [[Material (band)|Material]] and [[Laurie Anderson]] to [[Throbbing Gristle]], [[The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], and in [[Gus Van Sant]]'s 1989 film ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]],'' playing a character based on a short story he published in ''[[Exterminator!]]'', \"[[The \"Priest\" They Called Him]]\", featuring a guitar track supplied by [[Kurt Cobain]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Burroughs and R.E.M. collaborated on the song \"Star Me Kitten\" on the ''Songs in the Key of X: Music From and Inspired By The X-Files'' album. A collaboration with musicians [[Nick Cave]] and [[Tom Waits]] resulted in a collection of short prose, ''Smack My Crack'', later released as a spoken word album in 1987. In 1990, he released the spoken word album ''[[Dead City Radio]],'' with musical back-up from producers [[Hal Willner]] and Nelson Lyon, and [[alternative rock]] band [[Sonic Youth]]. He collaborated with Tom Waits and director [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] on ''[[The Black Rider]]'', a play which opened at the Thalia Theatre in [[Hamburg]] in 1990 to critical acclaim, and that was later performed all over Europe and the U.S. In 1991, with Burroughs' approval, director [[David Cronenberg]] adapted ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' into a feature film, which opened to critical acclaim.\n\nDuring 1982, Burroughs developed a painting technique whereby he created abstract compositions by placing spray paint cans in front of blank surfaces, and then shooting at the paint cans with a shotgun. These splattered and shot panels and canvasses were first exhibited in the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York City in 1987. By this time he had developed a comprehensive visual art practice, using ink, spray paint, collage and unusual things such as mushrooms and plungers to apply the paint. He created file-folder paintings featuring these mediums as well as \"automatic calligraphy\" inspired by Brion Gysin. He originally used the folders to mix pigments before observing that they could be viewed as art in themselves. He also used many of these painted folders to store manuscripts and correspondence in his personal archive <ref>[http://www.riflemaker.org/s-William-S-Burroughs William S.

W.

According to his biographer Ted Morgan, his philosophy for living one's life was to adhere to a laissez-faire path, one without encumbrances\u2014in essence a credo shared with the capitalist business world.<ref>Morgan, Ted, \"Literary Outlaw\", W. W. Norton & Company, 2012, p. 55</ref> His abhorrence of the government did not prevent Burroughs from using its programs to his own advantage. In 1949 he enrolled in [[Mexico City College]] under the [[GI Bill]], which paid for part of his tuition and books and provided him with a seventy-five-dollar-per-month stipend.

''The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs.'' Mandrake of Oxford.</ref> As he himself explained:\n\n<blockquote>In the magical universe there are no coincidences and there are no accidents. Nothing happens unless someone wills it to happen. The dogma of science is that the will cannot possibly affect external forces, and I think that's just ridiculous. It's as bad as the church. My viewpoint is the exact contrary of the scientific viewpoint. I believe that if you run into somebody in the street it's for a reason. Among primitive people they say that if someone was bitten by a snake he was murdered. I believe that.<ref>William S. Burroughs, quoted in Morgan, Ted (1988). ''Literary Outlaw.'' Pimlico.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOr, speaking in the 1970s:\n\n<blockquote>Since the word \"magic\" tends to cause confused thinking, I would like to say exactly what I mean by \"magic\" and the magical interpretation of so-called reality. The underlying assumption of magic is the assertion of \"will\" as the primary moving force in this universe - the deep conviction that nothing happens unless somebody or some being wills it to happen. To me this has always seemed self evident ... From the viewpoint of magic, no death, no illness, no misfortune, accident, war or riot is accidental. There are no accidents in the world of magic.<ref>William S. Burroughs, in conversation with Stephen Davis, ''Rock Magic'', Crawdaddy Magazine. 1975.

Publication of a memoir by Burroughs entitled ''Evil River'' by [[Viking Press]] has been delayed several times; after initially being announced for a 2005 release, online booksellers indicated a 2007 release, complete with an ISBN number ({{ISBN|0670813516}}), but it remains unpublished.<ref>[http://realitystudio.org/criticism/evil-river/ Reality Studio.org: Evil River-A Burroughs Memoir?], a 2005 discussion on the origin of this book.</ref> In December 2007, [[Ohio State University Press]] released ''Everything Lost: The Latin American Journals of William S.

Retrieved March 3, 2008.</ref> Several of Burroughs early novels, including ''Junky'' and ''Naked Lunch,'' have been republished in posthumous \"Restored Text\" editions, incorporating material edited out of previous versions.\n\n==Literary style and periods==\nBurroughs' major works can be divided into four different periods. The dates refer to the time of writing, not publication, which in some cases was not until decades later:\n* '''Early work''' (early 1950s): ''[[Junkie (novel)|Junkie]]'', ''[[Queer (novel)|Queer]]'' and ''[[The Yage Letters]]'' are relatively straightforward linear narratives, written in and about Burroughs' time in Mexico City and South America.\n* '''The cut-up period''' (mid-1950s to mid-1960s): Although published before Burroughs discovered the [[cut-up technique]], ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' is a fragmentary collection of \"routines\" from ''[[The Word Hoard]]'' \u2013 manuscripts written in Tangier, Paris, London, as well as of other texts written in South America such as \"The Composite City\", blending into the [[Cut-up technique|cut-up and fold-in]] fiction also partly drawn from ''The Word Hoard'': ''[[The Soft Machine]]'', ''[[Nova Express]]'', ''[[The Ticket That Exploded]]'', also referred to as \"[[The Nova Trilogy]]\" or \"The Cut-Up Trilogy\", self-described by Burroughs as an attempt to create \"a mythology for the space age\". ''[[Interzone (book)|Interzone]]'' also derives from the mid-1950s.\n* '''Experiment and subversion''' (mid-1960s to mid-1970s): This period saw Burroughs continue experimental writing with increased political content and branching into multimedia such as film and sound recording. The only major novel written in this period was ''[[The Wild Boys (novel)|The Wild Boys]]'', but he also wrote dozens of published articles, short stories, scrap books and other works, several in collaboration with Brion Gysin. The major anthologies representing work from this period are ''[[The Burroughs File]]'', ''[[The Adding Machine: Collected Essays|The Adding Machine]]'' and ''[[Exterminator!]]''.\n* '''The ''Red Night'' trilogy''' (mid-1970s to mid-1980s): The books ''[[Cities of the Red Night]]'', ''[[The Place of Dead Roads]]'' and ''[[The Western Lands]]'' came from Burroughs in a final, mature stage, creating a complete mythology.\n\nBurroughs also produced numerous essays and a large body of autobiographical material, including a book with a detailed account of his own dreams (''My Education: A Book of Dreams'').\n\n===Reaction to critics and view on criticism===\nSeveral [[literary criticism|literary critics]] treated Burroughs' work harshly. For example, [[Anatole Broyard]] and [[Philip Toynbee]] wrote devastating reviews of some of his most important books. In a short essay entitled \"A Review of the Reviewers\", Burroughs answers his critics in this way:\n\n{{quote|Critics constantly complain that writers are lacking in standards, yet they themselves seem to have no standards other than personal prejudice for literary criticism. ... such standards do exist. [[Matthew Arnold]] set up three criteria for criticism: 1. What is the writer trying to do? 2. How well does he succeed in doing it? ... 3. Does the work exhibit \"high seriousness\"? That is, does it touch on basic issues of good and evil, life and death and the human condition. I would also apply a fourth criterion ... ''Write about what you know.'' More writers fail because they try to write about things they don't know than for any other reason.|William S. Burroughs|\"A Review of the Reviewers\"<ref>Burroughs, William S. ''The Adding Machine: Selected Essays''. Arcade Publishing, 1993</ref>}}\n\nBurroughs clearly indicates here that he prefers to be evaluated against such criteria over being reviewed based on the reviewer's personal reactions to a certain book. Always a contradictory figure, Burroughs nevertheless criticized Anatole Broyard for reading [[authorial intent]] into his works where there is none, which sets him at odds both with New Criticism and the old school as represented by Matthew Arnold.\n\n===Photography===\nBurroughs used photography extensively throughout his career, both as a recording medium in planning his writings, and as a significant dimension of his own artistic practice, in which photographs and other images feature as significant elements in cut-ups. With Ian Sommerville, he experimented with photography's potential as a form of memory-device, photographing and rephotographing his own pictures in increasingly complex time-image arrangements.<ref>Patricia Allmer and John Sears (ed.) ''Taking Shots: The Photography of William S. Burroughs'', London: Prestel and The Photographers' Gallery, 2014).</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nBurroughs is often called one of the greatest and most influential writers of the 20th century, most notably by [[Norman Mailer]] whose quote on Burroughs, \"The only American novelist living today who may conceivably be possessed by genius\", appears on many Burroughs publications. Others consider his concepts and attitude more influential than his [[prose]]. Prominent admirers of Burroughs' work have included British critic and biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]], the [[Music journalism|rock critic]] [[Lester Bangs]], the philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] and the authors [[J. G. Ballard]], [[Angela Carter]], [[Jean Genet]], [[William Gibson]], [[Alan Moore]], [[Kathy Acker]] and [[Ken Kesey]]. Burroughs had an influence on the German writer [[Carl Weissner]], who in addition to being his German translator was a novelist in his own right and frequently wrote cut-up texts in a manner reminiscent of Burroughs.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://realitystudio.org/publications/death-in-paris/in-memory-of-carl-weissner/ |title = In Memory of Carl Weissner |date = January 25, 2012 |publisher = Reality Studio |accessdate = February 25, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBurroughs continues to be named as an influence by contemporary writers of fiction. Both the [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]] and, especially, the [[cyberpunk]] schools of [[science fiction]] are indebted to him. Admirers from the late 1970s\u2014early 1980s milieu of this subgenre include [[William Gibson]] and [[John Shirley]], to name only two. First published in 1982, the British [[Slipstream (genre)|slipstream]] fiction magazine ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' (which later evolved into a more traditional [[science fiction magazine]]) paid tribute to him with its choice of name. He is also cited as a major influence by musicians [[Roger Waters]], [[David Bowie]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Genesis P-Orridge]], [[Ian Curtis]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kurt Cobain]].<ref>[http://www.beatdom.com/?p=620 Wills, D. 'Modern Beats: Tom Waits', in Wills, D. (ed.), ''Beatdom'', Vol. 3 (Dundee: Mauling Press, 2007) p. ????]</ref>\n\nDrugs, homosexuality, and death, common among Burroughs' themes, have been taken up by [[Dennis Cooper]], of whom Burroughs said, \"Dennis Cooper, God help him, is a born writer\".<ref>{{cite book |title = My Loose Thread |publisher = Canongate Books |author = Cooper, Dennis |year = 2003 |page = [https://archive.org/details/myloosethreadcoo00denn/page/1 1] |isbn = 9781841954127 |url = https://archive.org/details/myloosethreadcoo00denn/page/1 }}</ref> Cooper, in return, wrote, in his essay 'King Junk', \"along with [[Jean Genet]], [[John Rechy]], and [[Allen Ginsberg|Ginsberg]], [Burroughs] helped make homosexuality seem cool and highbrow, providing gay liberation with a delicious edge\". [[Splatterpunk]] writer [[Poppy Z. Brite]] has frequently referenced this aspect of Burroughs' work. Burroughs' writing continues to be referenced years after his death; for example, a November 2004 episode of the TV series ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' included an evil character named Dr. Benway (named for an amoral physician who appears in a number of Burroughs' works.) This is an echo of the hospital scene in the movie ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]],'' made during Burroughs' life-time, in which both Dr. Benway and Mr. Lee (a Burroughs pen name) are paged.\n\nBurroughs had an impact on twentieth-century esotericism and occultism as well, most notably through disciples like [[Peter Lamborn Wilson]] and Genesis P-Orridge. Burroughs is also cited by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] as the first person to notice the \"[[23 Enigma]]\":\n\n{{quote|I first heard of the 23 Enigma from William S. Burroughs, author of Naked Lunch, Nova Express, etc. According to Burroughs, he had known a certain Captain Clark, around 1960 in Tangier, who once bragged that he had been sailing 23 years without an accident. That very day, Clark's ship had an accident that killed him and everybody else aboard. Furthermore, while Burroughs was thinking about this crude example of the irony of the gods that evening, a bulletin on the radio announced the crash of an airliner in Florida, USA. The pilot was another Captain Clark and the flight was Flight 23.|Robert Anton Wilson|''[[Fortean Times]]''<ref>{{cite magazine |title = The 23 Phenomenon |author = Robert Anton Wilson |url = http://forteantimes.com/features/commentary/396/the_23_phenomenon.html |magazine = [[Fortean Times]] |date = May 2007 |accessdate = September 25, 2008 |authorlink = Robert Anton Wilson |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120526215723/http://forteantimes.com/features/commentary/396/the_23_phenomenon.html |archivedate = May 26, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>}}\n\nSome research<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cowan |first1=Tommy P |title=What Most People Would Call Evil: The Archontic Spirituality of William S.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|on the cover]] of [[The Beatles]]' eighth studio album, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.\nBurroughs participated on numerous album releases by [[Giorno Poetry Systems]], including ''The Nova Convention'' (featuring [[Frank Zappa]], [[John Cage]], and [[Philip Glass]]) and ''You're the Guy I Want to Share My Money With'' (with [[John Giorno]] and [[Laurie Anderson]]).\n\nHe is featured in a spoken word piece entitled \"Sharkey's Night\" on Laurie Anderson's 1984 album ''[[Mister Heartbreak]]'', but the longer version of this track, with additional dialogue from Burroughs, was released only on a promotional 4-track 12\" Ep (Warner Bros PRO-A-2123). In addition, Burroughs provided vocal samples for the soundtrack of Anderson's 1986 [[concert film]], ''[[Home of the Brave (1986 film)|Home of the Brave]]'', and made a cameo appearance in it.\n\nBurroughs reads a passage from his novel ''[[Nova Express]]'' during the bridge of the title song from [[Todd Tamanend Clark]]'s 1984 album ''Into The Vision'', which also features [[Cheetah Chrome]] from [[The Dead Boys]] on guitar.\n\n[[Bill Laswell]]'s [[Material (band)|Material]] collaborated with Burroughs to produce the 1989 album ''[[Seven Souls (album)|Seven Souls]]'', wherein Burroughs recites passages from his book ''[[The Western Lands]]'' to musical accompaniment. The album was reissued in 1997 with 3 bonus remixes. In 1998, an additional unreleased six remixes (plus one previously released) were introduced on the album ''[[Seven Souls#The Road to the Western Lands|The Road To The Western Lands]]''. [[Spring Heel Jack]]'s remix of the track '\"The Road to the Western Lands\" from this album was also included on their ''Oddities'' album from 2000.\n\nIn 1990, [[Island Records]] released ''Dead City Radio'', a collection of readings set to a broad range of musical compositions. It was produced by [[Hal Willner]] and Nelson Lyon, with musical accompaniment from [[John Cale]], [[Donald Fagen]], [[Lenny Pickett]], [[Chris Stein]], Sonic Youth, and others. The remastered edition of Sonic Youth's album ''[[Goo (album)|Goo]]'' includes a longer version of \"Dr. Benway's House\", which had appeared, in shorter form, on ''Dead City Radio''.\n\nIn 1992 he recorded \"Quick Fix\" with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], which appeared on their single for \"[[Just One Fix]]\". The single featured cover art by Burroughs and a remix of the song dubbed the \"W.S.B. mix\". Burroughs also made an appearance in the video for \"Just One Fix\". The same year he also recorded the EP ''[[The \"Priest\" They Called Him]]''; Burroughs reads the [[Exterminator!|short story of the same name]], while [[Kurt Cobain]] creates layers of guitar feedback and distortion. [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] bassist [[Krist Novoselic]] is featured on the cover as the titular \"Priest\". The track on the 13th Ministry album \"Thanx but No Thanx\" makes use of William S. Burroughs' poem \"A Thanksgiving Prayer\", as read by Sgt. Major.\n\nIn 1992 Burroughs worked with [[The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy]] on ''[[Spare Ass Annie and Other Tales]]'', with the duo providing musical background and accompaniment to Burroughs' spoken readings from several of his books. A 12\" EP was released with five different remixes of the ''Spare Ass Annie'' track \"Words of Advice for Young People\", all done by Bill Laswell.\n\nBurroughs appears on two songs from ''[[Technodon]]'', the 1993 reunion album by the Japanese electronic group [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]. The opening track, \"Be a Superman\", begins with a sample of Burroughs proclaiming, \"Be a man! Be a human animal... be a superman! Be a superman.\" The latter part of the sample reappears throughout. \"I Tre Merli\" features a longer reading taken from ''The Job''.\n\nBurroughs recites the lyrics of [[R.E.M.]]'s \"Star Me Kitten\" for a special version of the song on the ''[[Songs in the Key of X: Music from and Inspired by the X-Files]]'' soundtrack.\n\nBurroughs appears near the end of [[U2]]'s music video \"[[Last Night on Earth (U2 song)|Last Night on Earth]]\", pushing a shopping cart with a large spotlight positioned inside it. The video ends with a close up of his eyes.\n\nBurroughs is featured on the 2000 compilation tribute album, ''[[Stoned Immaculate]]'', on a track that pairs Jim Morrison yelping and groaning with Burroughs reading Morrison's poetry. The music was recorded by the surviving Doors members in 2000 specifically for this album.<ref>''[[Stoned Immaculate: The Music of The Doors]]'' liner notes</ref>\n\nA Burroughs quote from a visualisation exercise called 'Take Nirvana'<ref>{{cite book|title= Refiguring Techniques in Digital Visual Research|url=https://books.google.com/?id=adsxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA121 |accessdate=11 April 2018|isbn=9783319612225|last1=Cruz|first1=Edgar G\u00f3mez|last2=Sumartojo|first2=Shanti|last3=Pink|first3=Sarah|date=2017-08-20}}</ref> was used by director [[Shane Meadows]] in the final scene of [[The Stone Roses]]' 2013 concert DVD, ''[[The Stone Roses: Made of Stone|Made of Stone]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title= Phoenix New Times|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/how-made-of-stone-explains-the-stone-roses-and-the-death-of-rave-culture-6622505|publisher=phoenixnewtimes.com|accessdate=11 April 2018|date=2013-12-11}}</ref>\n\n=====Band names=====\nNumerous bands have found their names in Burroughs' work. The most widely known of these is [[Steely Dan]], a group named after a [[dildo]] in ''[[Naked Lunch]]''.<ref>[http://www.steelydan.com/faq.html FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64t7qffjJ?url=http://www.steelydan.com/faq.html |date=January 22, 2012 }} from the Official [[Steely Dan]] website</ref> Also from ''Naked Lunch'' came the names [[Clarknova]], [[The Mugwumps (band)|The Mugwumps]] and [[The Insect Trust]]. The novel ''[[Nova Express]]'' inspired the names of [[Grant Hart]]'s post-[[H\u00fcsker D\u00fc]] band Nova Mob, as well as Australian 1960s R&B band Nova Express.<ref>[http://www.milesago.com/artists/nova.html Nova Express], band profile</ref> British band [[Soft Machine]] took its moniker from the Burroughs novel of the same name.

In 1968, an abbreviated\u201477 minutes as opposed to the original's 104 minutes\u2014version of [[Benjamin Christensen]]'s 1922 film ''[[H\u00e4xan]]'' was released, subtitled ''Witchcraft Through The Ages''.

Burroughs Films<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Jack Sargeant (writer)|Jack Sargeant]]'s book ''[[Naked Lens: Beat Cinema]]'' details Burroughs' film work at length, covering his collaborations with Balch and Burroughs' theories of film.\n\nBurroughs narrated part of the 1980 documentary ''Shamans of the Blind Country'' by anthropologist and filmmaker Michael Oppitz.<ref>[http://www.musethno.unizh.ch/de/publikationen/michael_oppitz.html Ausgew\u00e4hlte Publikationen von Michael Oppitz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523191844/http://www.musethno.unizh.ch/de/publikationen/michael_oppitz.html |date=May 23, 2008 }} from the website of the Ethnographic Museum of the [[University of Z\u00fcrich]].</ref> He gave a reading on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on November 7, 1981, in an episode hosted by [[Lauren Hutton]].\n\nIn 1983 director [[Howard Brookner]] released ''[[Burroughs: the Movie]]''. The film is perhaps the definitive account of Burroughs' life, and Brookner and Burroughs maintained a very close collaboration during the shooting process. The film features interviews with many of Burroughs' friends and collaborators including [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Brion Gysin]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Herbert Huncke]], [[Patti Smith]] and [[Terry Southern]].\n\nBurroughs subsequently made [[cameo appearance]]s in a number of other films and videos, such as [[David Blair (director)|David Blair]]'s ''[[Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees]]'', an elliptic story about the first [[Gulf War]] in which Burroughs plays a beekeeper, and ''[[Decoder (film)|Decoder]]'' by Klaus Maeck. He played an aging junkie priest in [[Gus Van Sant]]'s 1989 film ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]''. He also appears briefly at the beginning of Van Sant's ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]'' (based on the Tom Robbins [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (novel)|novel]]), in which he is seen crossing a city street; as the noise of the city rises around him he pauses in the middle of the intersection and speaks the single word \"ominous\". Van Sant's short film \"Thanksgiving Prayer\" features Burroughs reading the poem \"Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 28, 1986\", from ''[[Tornado Alley (book)|Tornado Alley]]'', intercut with a collage of black and white images.\n\nBurroughs was portrayed by [[Kiefer Sutherland]] in the 2000 film ''[[Beat (2000 film)|Beat]]'', written and directed by Gary Walkow. Loosely biographical, the plot involves a car trip to Mexico City with Vollmer, Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Lucien Carr, and includes a scene of Vollmer's shooting.\n\nBurroughs is portrayed by [[Ben Foster]] in the 2013 film ''[[Kill Your Darlings (2013 film)|Kill Your Darlings]]'', directed by John Krokidas and written by John Krokidas and Austin Bunn. The film tells the story of Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan) and David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), with appearances by actors playing Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) and Kerouac (Jack Huston).<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/movies/kill-your-darlings-stars-daniel-radcliffe.html?src=dayp&pagewanted=2 \"The Watchful Years, Before the Howling Began\" (movie review)], ''The New York Times'', October 15, 2013.</ref>\n\nNear the end of his life, recordings of Burroughs reading his short stories \"A Junky's Christmas\" and \"Ah Pook Is Here\" were used on the soundtracks of two highly acclaimed animated films.<ref>[http://www.beatdom.com/?p=701 Wills, David, \"Naked Lunch on Film\" in ''Beatdom'', Vol. 5 (City of Recovery Press, 2009), p. 30.]</ref>\n\nFilmmakers Lars Movin and Steen Moller Rasmussen used footage of Burroughs taken during a 1983 tour of Scandinavia in the documentary ''[[Words of Advice: William S. Burroughs on the Road]]''. A 2010 documentary, ''William S. Burroughs: A Man Within'', was made for [[Independent Lens]] on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].\n\n''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' (released in December 1997) was dedicated to Burroughs, as well as Ginsberg, who died four months earlier.<ref name=\"ES-19980303\">{{cite web |last1=Clarke |first1=Roger |title=Roger Clarke {{!}} Gus Van Sant |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/film/roger-clarke-6331844.html |website=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=May 18, 2019 |date=March 3, 1998}}</ref>\n\n====As a fictional character====\nBurroughs was fictionalized in Jack Kerouac's [[autobiographical novel]] ''[[On the Road]]'' as \"Old Bull Lee\". He also makes an appearance in [[J. G. Ballard]]'s semi-autobiographical 1991 novel ''[[The Kindness of Women]]''. In the 2004 novel ''[[Move Under Ground]]'', Burroughs, Kerouac, and [[Neal Cassady]] team up to defeat [[Cthulhu]].\n\nBurroughs appears in the first part of ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and Robert Anton Wilson during the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] riots and is described as a person devoid of anger, passion, indignation, hope, or any other recognizable human emotion. He is presented as a polar opposite of [[Allen Ginsberg]], as Ginsberg believed in everything and Burroughs believed in nothing. Wilson would recount in his ''[[Cosmic Trigger II: Down to Earth]]'' having interviewed both Burroughs and Ginsberg for ''[[Playboy]]'' the day the riots began, as well as his experiences with Shea during the riots, providing details on the creation of the fictional sequence.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Wilson |first1 = Robert Anton |title = Cosmic Trigger Volume 2, Down to Earth |publisher = New Falcon Publications |date = 1993 |page = 37 |isbn = 978-1561840113 }}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Main|William S.

Burroughs was a primary figure of the [[Beat Generation]] and a major [[Postmodern literature|postmodernist]] author whose influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature. Burroughs wrote eighteen novels and novellas, six collections of short stories and four collections of essays. Five books have been published of his interviews and correspondences. He also collaborated on projects and recordings with numerous performers and musicians and made many appearances in films. He was also briefly known by the [[pen name]] '''William Lee'''. Burroughs created and exhibited thousands of paintings and other visual artworks, including his celebrated 'Gunshot Paintings'.\n\nHe was born into a wealthy family in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], grandson of the inventor and founder of the [[Burroughs Corporation]], [[William Seward Burroughs I]], and nephew of public relations manager [[Ivy Lee]]. Burroughs began writing essays and journals in early adolescence but did not begin publicizing his writing until his thirties. He left home in 1932 to attend [[Harvard University]], studied English, and [[anthropology]] as a postgraduate, and later attended medical school in Vienna. In 1942 Burroughs enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve during World War II, but was turned down by the [[Office of Strategic Services]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]], after which he picked up the drug addiction that affected him for the rest of his life, while working a variety of jobs. In 1943, while living in New York City, he befriended [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Jack Kerouac]], and out of their mutual influence grew the foundation of the Beat Generation, which was later a defining influence on the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]].\n\nMuch of Burroughs' work is semiautobiographical, primarily drawn from his experiences as a [[heroin]] addict, as he lived throughout [[Mexico City]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and the [[Tangier International Zone]] near [[Morocco]], as well as from his travels in the South American [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. His work also features frequent [[mysticism|mystical]], [[occult]] or otherwise [[Magic (supernatural)|magical]] themes \u2013 a constant preoccupation for Burroughs, both in fiction and in real life.<ref>Stevens, Matthew Levi (2014). The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs. Mandrake of Oxford.</ref><ref>Morgan, Ted (1988). Literary Outlaw. Pimlico.</ref>\n\nBurroughs killed his second wife, [[Joan Vollmer]], in 1951 in Mexico City. Burroughs initially claimed that he shot Vollmer while drunkenly attempting a \"[[William Tell]]\" stunt.<ref>El Nacional, Sept. 8, 1951</ref> He later told investigators a different story: that he had been showing his pistol to friends, when it fell and hit the table, firing the bullet that killed Vollmer.<ref>La Prensa, Sept. 8, 1951</ref> After Burroughs returned to the United States, he was convicted of manslaughter ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', and received a two-year suspended sentence.\n\nBurroughs found success with his confessional first novel, ''[[Junkie (novel)|Junkie]]'' (1953), but he is perhaps best known for his third novel ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' (1959), a highly controversial work that was the subject of a court case after it was challenged as being in violation of the U.S. [[Sodomy laws in the United States|sodomy laws]]. With [[Brion Gysin]], he also popularized the literary [[cut-up technique]] in works such as [[The Nova Trilogy]] (1961\u20131964).\n\nIn 1983, Burroughs was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters|American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]], and in 1984 he was awarded the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by France.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/william-s-burroughs Biography], ''The Guardian''</ref> Jack Kerouac called Burroughs the \"greatest [[Satire|satirical]] writer since [[Jonathan Swift]]\",<ref name=\"harpermodern\">''Naked Lunch: The Restored Text'', Harper Perennial Modern Classics (2005). It includes an introduction by [[J. G. Ballard]] and an appendix of biography and reference to further reading: \"About the author\", \"About the book\" and \"Read on\".</ref> a reputation he owes to his \"lifelong subversion\"<ref name=\"penguin\">2003 ''Penguin Modern Classics'' edition of ''Junky''.</ref> of the moral, political, and economic systems of modern American society, articulated in often darkly humorous [[sardonicism]]. [[J. G. Ballard]] considered Burroughs to be \"the most important writer to emerge since the Second World War\", while [[Norman Mailer]] declared him \"the only [[American literature|American writer]] who may be conceivably possessed by genius\".<ref name=\"harpermodern\"/>\n\nBurroughs created visual art throughout his lifetime, but never exhibited it until 1987, after the death of his friend and collaborator [[Brion Gysin]]. For the next and last 10 years of his life, he presented his paintings and drawings at museums and galleries worldwide.\n\nBurroughs had one child, [[William S. Burroughs Jr.]] (1947\u20131981), with his second wife Joan Vollmer. William Burroughs died at his home in [[Lawrence, Kansas]], after suffering a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1997.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nBurroughs was born in 1914, the younger of two sons born to Mortimer Perry Burroughs (June 16, 1885&nbsp;\u2013 January 5, 1965) and Laura Hammon Lee (August 5, 1888&nbsp;\u2013 October 20, 1970). His was a prominent family of [[English American|English ancestry]] in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]]. His grandfather, [[William Seward Burroughs I]], founded the Burroughs Adding Machine company, which evolved into the [[Burroughs Corporation]]. Burroughs' mother was the daughter of a minister whose family claimed to be closely related to [[Robert E. Lee]]. His maternal uncle, [[Ivy Lee]], was an advertising pioneer later employed as a publicist for the Rockefellers. His father ran an antique and gift shop, Cobblestone Gardens in St. Louis; and later in [[Palm Beach, Florida]] when they relocated.\n\nIt was during his childhood that Burroughs' developed a lifelong interest in [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]] and the [[occult]] \u2013 topics which would find their way into his work repeatedly across the years.<ref>\"'''TV:''' So much of your work deals with the juncture between science and mystery, it seems. I mean there've been references to Orgone boxes, and Scientology, and Castaneda, it just goes on and on ... how did you get interested in this sort of area? '''WB:''' Always was. I always was involved in that area from my early childhood. I was always interested in the occult and the mysterious ... just a life-long preoccupation.\" \u2013 William S. Burroughs, interviewed by Tom Vitali, 26th Nov 1986. Transcript published as ''A Moveable Feast'' in ''Burroughs Live: The Collected Interviews of William S. Burroughs 1960-1977. 2001.</ref> Burroughs later described how he saw an apparition of a green reindeer in the woods as a child, which he identified as a [[totem|totem animal]],<ref>\"When I was four years old I saw a vision in Forest Park, St. Louis ... I was lagging behind and I saw a little green reindeer about the size of a cat ... Later, when I studied anthropology at Harvard, I learned that this was a totem animal vision and knew that I could never kill a reindeer.\" \u2013 William S. Burroughs, ''The Cat Inside''. Viking. 1992.</ref> as well as a vision of ghostly grey figures at play in his bedroom.<ref>\"I was subject to hallucinations as a child. Once I woke up in the early morning light and saw little men playing in a block house I had made. I felt no fear, only a feeling of stillness and wonder.\" \u2013 William S. Burroughs, prologue, ''Junky''. Penguin. 1977.</ref>\n\nAs a boy, Burroughs lived on Pershing Avenue (now Pershing Place) in St. Louis' [[Central West End, St. Louis|Central West End]]. He attended [[John Burroughs School]] in St. Louis where his first published essay, \"Personal Magnetism\" \u2013 which revolved around telepathic mind-control \u2013 was printed in the ''John Burroughs Review'' in 1929.<ref>[http://www.popsubculture.com/pop/bio_project/william_s_burroughs.html William S Burroughs] Popsubculture.com Biography.</ref> He then attended the [[Los Alamos Ranch School]] in New Mexico, which was stressful for him. The school was a [[boarding school]] for the wealthy, \"where the spindly sons of the rich could be transformed into manly specimens\".<ref>Morgan, Ted, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 44.</ref> Burroughs kept [[diary|journals]] documenting an erotic attachment to another boy. According to his own account, he destroyed these later, ashamed of their content.<ref name=\"Word Virus 2000, p. 21\">''Word Virus: The William S. Burroughs Reader''. James Grauerholz, Ira Silverberg, Ann Douglas (eds), Grove Press, 2000, p. 21.</ref> He kept his sexual orientation concealed from his family well into adulthood, due to the context in which he grew up and from which he fled\u2014that is, a \"family where displays of affection were considered embarrassing\".<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 26.</ref> He became a well-known homosexual writer after the publication of ''Naked Lunch'' in 1959. Some {{Who| date=November 2011}} say that he was expelled from Los Alamos after taking [[chloral hydrate]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] with a fellow student. Yet, according to his own account, he left voluntarily: \"During the Easter vacation of my second year I persuaded my family to let me stay in St. Louis.\"<ref name=\"Word Virus 2000, p. 21\" />\n\n[[File:William S. Burroughs' childhood home .jpg|thumb|William S. Burroughs' childhood home on Pershing Place in St. Louis]]\n\n===Harvard University===\n\nBurroughs finished high school at Taylor School in [[Clayton, Missouri]], and in 1932 left home to pursue an arts degree at [[Harvard University]], where he was affiliated with [[Adams House (Harvard University)|Adams House]]. During the summers, he worked as a cub reporter for the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', covering the police docket. He disliked the work, and refused to cover some events, like the death of a drowned child. He lost his virginity in an [[East St. Louis, Illinois]] brothel that summer with a female prostitute whom he regularly patronized.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', papers, p. 62.</ref> While at Harvard, Burroughs made trips to New York City and was introduced to the gay subculture there. He visited lesbian dives, piano bars, and the [[Harlem]] and [[Greenwich Village]] homosexual underground with Richard Stern, a wealthy friend from [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. They would drive from Boston to New York in a reckless fashion. Once, Stern scared Burroughs so badly that he asked to be let out of the vehicle.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 611.</ref>\n\nBurroughs graduated from Harvard in 1936. According to Ted Morgan's ''Literary Outlaw'',\n\n<blockquote>His parents, upon his graduation, had decided to give him a monthly allowance of $200 out of their earnings from Cobblestone Gardens, a substantial sum in those days. It was enough to keep him going, and indeed it guaranteed his survival for the next twenty-five years, arriving with welcome regularity. The allowance was a ticket to freedom; it allowed him to live where he wanted to and to forgo employment.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 65.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBurroughs' parents sold the rights to his grandfather's invention and had no share in the [[Burroughs Corporation]]. Shortly before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]], they sold their stock for $200,000 (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|200000|1929|r=0}}}} in today's funds{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref name=NYTobit>{{cite news |title = William S.

He traveled to Europe and became involved in Austrian and Hungarian [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]]-era [[LGBT culture]]; he picked up young men in steam baths in Vienna and moved in a circle of exiles, homosexuals, and runaways. There, he met Ilse Klapper, n\u00e9e Herzfeld (1900\u20131982), a [[Jews|Jewish]] woman fleeing the country's [[Nazism|Nazi]] government.<ref name=\"Lawlor\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=MMZqLXP01e4C |title=Beat Culture: Lifestyles, Icons, and Impact|last=Lawlor|first=William|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781851094004|location=|pages=29|language=en}}</ref> The two were never romantically involved, but Burroughs married her, in [[Croatia]], against the wishes of his parents, to allow her to gain a visa to the United States. She made her way to New York City, and eventually divorced Burroughs, although they remained friends for many years.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', pp. 65\u20138.</ref> After returning to the United States, he held a string of uninteresting jobs. In 1939, his mental health became a concern for his parents, especially after he deliberately severed the last joint of his left little finger at the knuckle to impress a man with whom he was infatuated.<ref>Grauerholz, James. Introduction p. xv, in William Burroughs. ''Interzone''. New York: Viking Press, 1987.</ref> This event made its way into his early fiction as the [[short story]] \"The Finger.\"\n\n==Beginning of the Beats==\n\nBurroughs enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] early in 1942, shortly after the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]] brought the United States into [[World War II]]. But when he was classified as a 1-A Infantry, not an officer, he became dejected. His mother recognized her son's depression and got Burroughs a civilian disability discharge&nbsp;\u2014a release from duty based on the premise that he should have not been allowed to enlist due to previous mental instability. After being evaluated by a family friend, who was also a neurologist at a psychiatric treatment center, Burroughs waited five months in limbo at [[Jefferson Barracks]] outside St. Louis before being discharged. During that time he met a Chicago soldier also awaiting release, and once Burroughs was free, he moved to Chicago and held a variety of jobs, including one as an [[Pest control|exterminator]]. When two of his friends from St. Louis, [[Lucien Carr]], a [[University of Chicago]] student, and David Kammerer, Carr's admirer, left for New York City, Burroughs followed.\n\n===Joan Vollmer===\n\nIn 1944, Burroughs began living with [[Joan Vollmer|Joan Vollmer Adams]] in an apartment they shared with [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[Edie Parker]], Kerouac's first wife.<ref name=\"The Voice Is All\">{{cite book |title = The Voice Is All: The Lonely Victory of Jack Kerouac |publisher = Penguin Group |author = Johnson, Joyce |year = 2012 |isbn = 9780670025107 }}</ref> Vollmer Adams was married to a [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] with whom she had a young daughter, Julie Adams. Burroughs and Kerouac got into trouble with the law for failing to report a murder involving [[Lucien Carr]], who had killed David Kammerer in a confrontation over Kammerer's incessant and unwanted advances. This incident inspired Burroughs and Kerouac to collaborate on a novel titled ''[[And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks]]'', completed in 1945. The two fledgling authors were unable to get it published, but the manuscript was eventually published in November 2008 by [[Grove Press]] and [[Penguin Books]].\n\nDuring this time, Burroughs began using [[morphine]] and became [[Addiction|addicted]]. He eventually sold [[heroin]] in [[Greenwich Village]] to support his habit. Vollmer also became an addict, but her drug of choice was [[Benzedrine]], an [[amphetamine]] sold over the counter at that time.  Because of her addiction and social circle, her husband immediately divorced her after returning from the war. With urging from [[Allen Ginsberg]], and also perhaps Kerouac, Burroughs became intellectually and emotionally linked with Vollmer and by the summer of 1945 had moved in with Vollmer and her daughter. In spring 1946, Burroughs was arrested for forging a narcotics prescription. Vollmer asked her psychiatrist, a Dr. Wollberg, to sign a surety bond for Burroughs' release. As part of his release, Burroughs returned to St. Louis under his parents' care, after which he left for Mexico to get a divorce from Ilse Klapper. Meanwhile, Vollmer's addiction led to a temporary psychosis that resulted in her admission to  [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]], which endangered the custody of her child. Upon hearing this, Burroughs immediately returned to New York City to gain her release, asking her to marry him. Their marriage was never formalized, but she lived as his [[Common-law marriage|common-law wife]]. They returned to St. Louis to visit Burroughs' parents and then moved with her daughter to Texas.<ref name=word_virus>{{cite book |last1 = Grauerholz |first1 = James |last2 = Silverberg |first2 = Ira |title = Word Virus: The William S.

Burroughs also attended classes at the [[Mexico City College]] in 1950 studying Spanish, as well as \"Mexican picture writing\" ([[Aztec codices|codices]]) and the Mayan language with [[R. H.

Vollmer's daughter, Julie Adams, went to live with her grandmother, and William S. Burroughs Jr. went to St. Louis to live with his grandparents. Burroughs reported every Monday morning to the jail in Mexico City while his prominent Mexican attorney worked to resolve the case. According to [[James Grauerholz]], two witnesses had agreed to testify that the gun had fired accidentally while he was checking to see if it was loaded, with ballistics experts bribed to support this story.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 202.</ref> Nevertheless, the trial was continuously delayed and Burroughs began to write what would eventually become the short novel ''[[Queer (novel)|Queer]]'' while awaiting his trial. Upon Burroughs' attorney fleeing Mexico in light of his own legal problems, Burroughs decided, according to [[Ted Morgan (writer)|Ted Morgan]], to \"skip\" and return to the United States. He was convicted [[Trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] of homicide and was given a two-year suspended sentence.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 214.</ref>\n\nAlthough Burroughs was writing before the shooting of Joan Vollmer, this event marked him and, biographers argue, his work for the rest of his life.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', pp. 197\u2013198.</ref> Vollmer's death also resonated with [[Allen Ginsberg]], who wrote of her in ''Dream Record: June 8, 1955,'' \"Joan, what kind of knowledge have the dead? can you still love your mortal acquaintances? What do you remember of us?\"\n\n====''The Yage Letters''====\n\nAfter leaving Mexico, Burroughs drifted through South America for several months, seeking out a drug called [[Ayahuasca|yag\u00e9]], which promised to give the user [[Telepathy|telepathic]] abilities. A book composed of letters between Burroughs and Ginsberg, ''[[The Yage Letters]],'' was published in 1963 by [[City Lights Bookstore|City Lights Books]]. In 2006, a re-edited version, ''The Yage Letters Redux'', showed that the letters were largely fictionalised from Burroughs' notes.\n\n==Beginning of literary career==\nBurroughs described Vollmer's death as a pivotal event in his life, and one which provoked his writing by exposing him to the risk of [[Spirit possession|possession]] by a malevolent entity he called \"the Ugly Spirit\":\n\n<blockquote>I am forced to the appalling conclusion that I would never have become a writer but for Joan's death, and to a realization of the extent to which this event has motivated and formulated my writing. I live with the constant threat of possession, and a constant need to escape from possession, from Control. So the death of Joan brought me in contact with the invader, the Ugly Spirit, and maneuvered me into a life long struggle, in which I have had no choice except to write my way out.<ref name=\"Queer, Penguin 1985\">''Queer'', Penguin, 1985, p. xxiii.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs Burroughs makes clear, he meant this reference to \"possession\" to be taken absolutely literally, stating: \"My concept of possession is closer to the medieval model than to modern psychological explanations ... I mean a definite possessing entity.\"<ref name=\"Queer, Penguin 1985\"/> Burroughs' writing was intended as a form of \"sorcery\", in his own words<ref name=\"levistevens1\">Stevens, Matthew Levi. ''The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs.'' p.125.</ref> - to disrupt language via methods such as the [[cut-up technique]], and thus protect himself from possession.<ref name=\"levistevens2\">\"When Gysin, apparently in trance, told Burroughs 'The Ugly Spirit shot Joan because' he thought he finally had the answer ... the unforgiveable slip that had caused the death of his common-law wife, Joan Vollmer ... had come about because he was literally ''possessed'' by an evil spirit ... William instinctively knew the only solution available to him ... If the Word was indeed the basic mechanism of control - the 'virus' by which The Ugly Spirit, or its agency Control, exerted its malevolent influence - then surely a real understanding of the Word, what words are and what can be done with them - was essential. All these explorations and obsessions were not merely diversions, experiments for artistic or literary amusement ... but part of a deadly struggle with unseen, invisible - perhaps evil - psycho-spiritual enemies.\" \u2013 Stevens, Matthew Levi.

In any case, he had begun to write in 1945. Burroughs and Kerouac collaborated on ''[[And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks]]'', a mystery novel loosely based on the Carr/Kammerer situation and that at the time remained unpublished. Years later, in the documentary ''What Happened to Kerouac?'', Burroughs described it as \"not a very distinguished work\".

Due to legal problems, he was unable to live in the cities toward which he was most inclined. He spent time with his parents in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], and New York City with Allen Ginsberg. When Ginsberg refused his romantic advances,<ref>Bill Morgan, ''I Celebrate Myself'', 2006, New York: Viking Press, p. 159.</ref> Burroughs went to Rome to meet [[Alan Ansen]] on a vacation financed from his parents' continuing support. He found Rome and Ansen's company dreary, and inspired by [[Paul Bowles]]' fiction, he decided to head for the [[Tangier International Zone]],<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', pp. 232\u201334.</ref> where he rented a room and began to write a large body of text that he personally referred to as ''[[Interzone (book)|Interzone]]''.<ref>[[James Grauerholz]] writes, in ''Interzone'', the body of text that Burroughs was working on was called ''Interzone'', see Burroughs, William S. ''[[Interzone (book)|Interzone]]''. \"Introduction\", pp. ix\u2013xiii. New York: Viking Press, 1987.</ref>\n\nTo Burroughs, all signs directed a return to Tangier, a city where drugs were freely available and where financial support from his family would continue. He realized that in the Moroccan culture he had found an environment that synchronized with his temperament and afforded no hindrances to pursuing his interests and indulging in his chosen activities. He left for Tangier in November 1954 and spent the next four years there working on the fiction that would later become ''Naked Lunch'', as well as attempting to write commercial articles about Tangier. He sent these writings to Ginsberg, his literary agent for ''Junkie'', but none was published until 1989 when ''Interzone'', a collection of short stories, was published. Under the strong influence of a [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] confection known as [[majoun]] and a German-made [[opioid]] called  [[oxycodone|Eukodol]], Burroughs settled in to write. Eventually, Ginsberg and Kerouac, who had traveled to Tangier in 1957, helped Burroughs type, edit, and arrange these episodes into ''Naked Lunch''.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'',  pp. 238\u201342.</ref>\n\n===''Naked Lunch''===\n{{further|Naked Lunch}}\nWhereas ''Junkie'' and ''Queer'' were conventional in style, ''Naked Lunch'' was his first venture into a [[Nonlinear narrative|nonlinear]] style. After the publication of ''Naked Lunch'', a book whose creation was to a certain extent the result of a series of contingencies, Burroughs was exposed to [[Brion Gysin]]'s [[cut-up technique]] at the [[Beat Hotel]] in Paris in October 1959. He began slicing up phrases and words to create new sentences.<ref>Miles, Barry \"The Inventive Mind of Brion Gysin\" in Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9rez Kuri (ed) ''Brion Gysin: Tuning in to the Multimedia Age'', London: Thames and Hudson, 2003, p.124-125.</ref> At the Beat Hotel Burroughs discovered \"a port of entry\" into Gysin's canvases: \"I don't think I had ever seen painting until I saw the painting of Brion Gysin.\"<ref>Burroughs, William S., ''Ports of Entry \u2013 Here is Space-Time Painting'', p.32.</ref> The two would cultivate a long-term friendship that revolved around a mutual interest in artworks and cut-up techniques. Scenes were slid together with little care for [[narrative]]. Perhaps thinking of his crazed physician, Dr. Benway, he described ''Naked Lunch'' as a book that could be cut into at any point. Although not considered [[science fiction]], the book does seem to forecast [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], [[liposuction]], and the [[crack cocaine|crack]] pandemic.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 355.</ref>\n\nExcerpts from ''Naked Lunch'' were first published in the United States in 1958. The novel was initially rejected by City Lights Books, the publisher of Ginsberg's ''[[Howl]]''; and [[Olympia Press]] publisher [[Maurice Girodias]], who had published English-language novels in France that were controversial for their subjective views of sex and antisocial characters. But Allen Ginsberg managed to get excerpts published in ''[[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain Review]]'' and ''[[Chicago Review]]'' in 1958. [[Irving Rosenthal (writer)|Irving Rosenthal]], student editor of ''Chicago Review'', a quarterly journal partially subsidized by the university, promised to publish more excerpts from ''Naked Lunch'', but he was fired from his position in 1958 after ''Chicago Daily News'' columnist [[Jack Mabley]] called the first excerpt obscene. Rosenthal went on to publish more in his newly created literary journal ''[[Big Table (journal)|Big Table]] No. 1''; however, the [[United States Postmaster General]] ruled that copies could not be mailed to subscribers on the basis of obscenity laws. [[John Ciardi]] did get a copy and wrote a positive review of the work, prompting a telegram from Allen Ginsberg praising the review.<ref>Ginsberg, Allen. Postcard to John Ciardi. July 11, 1959. MS. Stuart Wright Collection: Richard Ghormley Eberhart Papers. Joyner Lib., Greenville, North Carolina.</ref> This controversy made ''Naked Lunch'' interesting to Girodias again, and he published the novel in 1959.{{Citation needed|date= November 2011}}\n\nAfter the novel was published, it slowly became notorious across Europe and the United States, garnering interest from not just members of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], but also literary critics such as [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]]. Once published in the United States, ''Naked Lunch'' was prosecuted as [[obscenity|obscene]] by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, followed by other states. In 1966, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] declared the work \"not obscene\" on the basis of criteria developed largely to defend the book. The case against Burroughs' novel still stands as the last obscenity trial against a work of literature\u2014that is, a work consisting of words only, and not including illustrations or photographs\u2014prosecuted in the United States.\n\nThe ''Word Hoard'', the collection of manuscripts that produced ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', also produced parts of the later works ''[[The Soft Machine]]'' (1961), ''[[The Ticket That Exploded]]'' (1962), and ''[[Nova Express]]'' (1964). These novels feature extensive use of the cut-up technique that influenced all of Burroughs' subsequent fiction to a degree. During Burroughs' friendship and artistic collaborations with Brion Gysin and [[Ian Sommerville (technician)|Ian Sommerville]], the technique was combined with images, Gysin's paintings, and sound, via Somerville's tape recorders. Burroughs was so dedicated to the cut-up method that he often defended his use of the technique before editors and publishers, most notably Dick Seaver at [[Grove Press]] in the 1960s<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 425.</ref> and [[Holt McDougal|Holt, Rinehart & Winston]] in the 1980s. The cut-up method, because of its random or mechanical basis for text generation, combined with the possibilities of mixing in text written by other writers, deemphasizes the traditional role of the writer as creator or originator of a string of words, while simultaneously exalting the importance of the writer's sensibility as an editor. In this sense, the cut-up method may be considered as analogous to the [[collage]] method in the visual arts. New restored editions of [[The Nova Trilogy]] (or Cut-Up Trilogy), edited by [[Oliver Harris]] (President of the [[European Beat Studies Network]]) and published in 2014, included notes and materials to reveal the care with which Burroughs used his methods and the complex histories of his manuscripts.\n\n===Paris and the \"Beat Hotel\"===\nBurroughs moved into a rundown hotel in the [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Latin Quarter]] of Paris in 1959 when ''Naked Lunch'' was still looking for a publisher. [[Tangier]], with its political unrest, and criminals with whom he had become involved, became dangerous to Burroughs.<ref>Grauerholz, James. Introduction p. xviii, in William Burroughs. ''Interzone''. New York: Viking Press, 1987.</ref> He went to Paris to meet Ginsberg and talk with [[Olympia Press]]. He left behind a criminal charge which eventually caught up with him in Paris. Paul Lund, a British former career criminal and cigarette smuggler whom Burroughs met in Tangier, was arrested on suspicion of importing narcotics into France. Lund gave up Burroughs, and evidence implicated Burroughs in the importation of narcotics into France. When the Moroccan authorities forwarded their investigation to French officials, Burroughs faced criminal charges in Paris for conspiracy to import opiates. It was during this impending case that [[Maurice Girodias]] published ''Naked Lunch''; its appearance helped to get Burroughs a suspended sentence, since a literary career, according to Ted Morgan, is a respected profession in France.\n\nThe \"[[Beat Hotel]]\" was a typical European-style [[boarding house]] hotel, with common toilets on every floor, and a small place for personal cooking in the room. Life there was documented by the photographer [[Harold Chapman]], who lived in the attic room. This shabby, inexpensive hotel was populated by [[Gregory Corso]], Ginsberg and [[Peter Orlovsky]] for several months after ''Naked Lunch'' first appeared.\n\nBurroughs' time at the Beat Hotel was dominated by occult experiments \u2013 \"[[mirror-gazing]], [[scrying]], [[trance]] and [[telepathy]], all fuelled by a wide variety of mind-altering drugs\".<ref name=\"levistevens3\">Stevens, Matthew Levi. ''The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs.'' p.50.</ref> Later, Burroughs would describe \"visions\" obtained by staring into the mirror for hours at a time \u2013 his hands transformed into tentacles,<ref>\"Once I looked in a mirror and saw my hands completely inhuman, thick, black-pink, fibrous, long white tendrils growing from the curiously abbreviated finger-tips as if the finger have been cut off to make way for tendrils.\" \u2013 William S.

Viking Penguin, 1993.</ref> It was from this febrile atmosphere that the famous [[cut-up technique]] emerged.\n\nThe actual process by which ''Naked Lunch'' was published was partly a function of its \"cut-up\" presentation to the printer. Girodias had given Burroughs only ten days to prepare the manuscript for print galleys, and Burroughs sent over the manuscript in pieces, preparing the parts in no particular order. When it was published in this authentically random manner, Burroughs liked it better than the initial plan. International rights to the work were sold soon after, and Burroughs used the $3,000 advance from [[Grove Press]] to buy drugs (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3000|1959|r=-3}}}} in today's funds{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p.316-326.</ref> ''Naked Lunch'' was featured in a 1959 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine cover story, partly as an article that highlighted the growing Beat literary movement. During this time Burroughs found an outlet for material otherwise rendered unpublishable in [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s ''[[My Own Mag]]''.<ref>[http://realitystudio.org/bibliographic-bunker/my-own-mag/ Reports from the Bibliographic Bunker: Jed Birmingham on William S. Burroughs Collecting]</ref> Also, poetry by Burroughs' appeared in the [[avant garde]] [[little magazine]] [[Nomad (magazine)|''Nomad'']] at the beginning of the 1960s.\n\n===The London years===\nBurroughs left Paris for London in 1960 to visit Dr. Dent, a well-known English medical doctor who spearheaded a reputedly painless heroin withdrawal treatment using the drug [[apomorphine]].<ref>Dent, John Yerbury. ''Anxiety and Its Treatment''. London: J. Murray, 1941.</ref> Dent's apomorphine cure was also used to treat alcoholism, although it was held by several people who undertook it to be no more than straightforward aversion therapy. Burroughs however was convinced. Following his first cure, he wrote a detailed appreciation of apomorphine and other cures, which he submitted to ''The British Journal of Addiction'' (Vol. 53, 1956) under the title \"Letter From A Master Addict To Dangerous Drugs\"; this letter is appended to many editions of ''Naked Lunch''.\n\nThough he ultimately relapsed, Burroughs ended up working out of London for six years, traveling back to the United States on several occasions, including one time escorting his son to the [[Federal Medical Center, Lexington|Lexington Narcotics Farm and Prison]] after the younger Burroughs had been convicted of prescription fraud in [[Florida]]. In the \"Afterword\" to the compilation of his son's two previously published novels ''Speed'' and ''Kentucky Ham'', Burroughs writes that he thought he had a \"small habit\" and left London quickly without any narcotics because he suspected the U.S. customs would search him very thoroughly on arrival. He claims he went through the most excruciating two months of opiate withdrawal while seeing his son through his trial and sentencing, traveling with Billy to [[Lexington, Kentucky]] from [[Miami]] to ensure that his son entered the hospital that he had once spent time in as a volunteer admission.<ref>Burroughs, William, S. \"Afterword\". ''Speed/Kentucky Ham: Two Novels''. New York: Overlook Press, 1984.</ref> Earlier, Burroughs revisited St. Louis, Missouri, taking a large advance from ''[[Playboy]]'' to write an article about his trip back to St. Louis, one that was eventually published in ''[[The Paris Review]]'', after Burroughs refused to alter the style for ''Playboy'''s publishers. In 1968 Burroughs joined [[Jean Genet]], [[John Sack]], and [[Terry Southern]] in covering the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine. Southern and Burroughs, who had first become acquainted in London, would remain lifelong friends and collaborators. In 1972, Burroughs and Southern unsuccessfully attempted to adapt ''Naked Lunch'' for the screen in conjunction with American game-show producer [[Chuck Barris]].<ref>Lee Hill ''A Grand Guy: The Art and Life of Terry Southern''.</ref>\n\nBurroughs supported himself and his addiction by publishing pieces in small literary presses. His avant-garde reputation grew internationally as hippies and college students discovered his earlier works. He developed a close friendship with [[Antony Balch]] and lived with a young hustler named John Brady who continuously brought home young women despite Burroughs' protestations. In the midst of this personal turmoil, Burroughs managed to complete two works: a novel written in [[screenplay]] format, ''[[The Last Words of Dutch Schultz]]'' (1969); and the traditional prose-format novel ''[[The Wild Boys (novel)|The Wild Boys]]'' (1971).\n\nIt was during his time in London that Burroughs began using his \"[[Playback (technique)|playback]]\" technique in an attempt to place [[curses]] on various people and places who had drawn his ire, including the Moka coffee bar<ref name=P-Orridge2>[[#refP-Orridge2|P-Orridge, Genesis. ''Magick Squares and Future Beats'']]</ref><ref>\"William continued going to the bar for a few more days, enduring their abuse, while he tape recorded the sounds inside. Later, he would stand outside and film or photograph the premises from outside. THen he went back n and began to play the tape recordings at low or subliminal levels, and continued to take photographs on his way in and out of the place ... The effects were remarkable: accidents occurred, fights broke out, the place lost customers, the subsequent loss of income became irredeemable, and within a few weeks, the bar was permanently closed.\" \u2013 Cabell McLean, ''Playback: My Experience of Chaos Magic with William S.

Burroughs also made similarly sorcerous attempts that same year against the London HQ of Scientology at 37 Fitzroy Street.

''The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs.'' p.129.</ref> Burroughs himself related the Moka coffee bar incident:\n\n<blockquote>Here is a sample operation carried out against the Moka Bar at 29 Frith Street, London, W1, beginning on August 3, 1972. Reverse Thursday. Reason for operation was outrageous and unprovoked discourtesy and poisonous cheesecake. Now to close in on the Moka Bar. Record. Take pictures. Stand around outside. Let them see me. They are seething around in there ... Playback would come later with more pictures ... Playback was carried out a number of times with more pictures. Their business fell off. They kept shorter and shorter hours. October 30, 1972, the Moka Bar closed. The location was taken over by the Queen's Snack Bar.<ref>William S. Burroughs, ''Playback From Eden to Watergate'', published in ''The Job''. John Calder Ltd.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the 1960s, Burroughs joined and then left the [[Church of Scientology]]. In talking about the experience, he claimed that the techniques and philosophy of Scientology helped him and that he felt that further study of Scientology would produce great results.<ref>[http://www.beatdom.com/?p=1373 David S. Wills, \"The Weird Cult: William S. Burroughs and Scientology\",] ''Beatdom Literary Journal'', December 2011.</ref> He was skeptical of the organization itself, and felt that it fostered an environment that did not accept critical discussion.<ref>[http://www.suburbia.com.au/~fun/scn/etc/wsb3.html Burroughs on Scientology], ''Los Angeles Free Press'', March 6, 1970.</ref> His subsequent critical writings about the church and his review of ''[[Inside Scientology: How I Joined Scientology and Became Superhuman|Inside Scientology]]'' by [[Robert Kaufman]] led to a battle of letters between Burroughs and Scientology supporters in the pages of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.\n\n==Return to United States==\nIn 1974, concerned about his friend's well-being, Allen Ginsberg gained for Burroughs a contract to teach [[creative writing]] at the [[City College of New York]]. Burroughs successfully withdrew from heroin use and moved to New York. He eventually found an apartment, affectionately dubbed \"The Bunker\", on the [[Lower East Side]] of Manhattan at 222 Bowery.<ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/222+Bowery,+New+York,+NY+10012/@40.7220402,-73.993453,3a,60y,292.52h,88.5t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssstm2M9ZCupP7EW9Q_4vPQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25985e2404163:0x9613dc038516de20!8m2!3d40.7221412!4d-73.9937417!6m1!1e1?hl=en  Google street view: 222 Bowery]</ref> The dwelling was a partially converted [[YMCA]] gym, complete with lockers and communal showers. The building fell within New York City [[rent control]] policies that made it extremely cheap; it was only about four hundred dollars a month until 1981 when the rent control rules changed, doubling the rent overnight.<ref>Bockris, Victor. ''With William Burroughs: A Report From the Bunker''. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1996.</ref> Burroughs added \"teacher\" to the list of jobs he did not like, as he lasted only a semester as a professor; he found the students uninteresting and without much creative talent. Although he needed income desperately, he turned down a teaching position at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] for $15,000 a semester. \"The teaching gig was a lesson in never again. You were giving out all this energy and nothing was coming back.\"<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 477.</ref> His savior was the newly arrived twenty-one-year-old bookseller and Beat Generation devotee [[James Grauerholz]], who worked for Burroughs part-time as a secretary as well as in a [[bookstore]]. Grauerholz suggested the idea of reading tours. Grauerholz had managed several rock bands in Kansas and took the lead in booking for Burroughs reading tours that would help support him throughout the next two decades. It raised his public profile, eventually aiding in his obtaining new publishing contracts. Through Grauerholz, Burroughs became a monthly columnist for the noted popular culture magazine ''[[Crawdaddy]]'', for which he interviewed [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[Jimmy Page]] in 1975. Burroughs decided to relocate back to the United States permanently in 1976. He then began to associate with New York cultural players such as [[Andy Warhol]], [[John Giorno]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Patti Smith]], and [[Susan Sontag]], frequently entertaining them at the Bunker; he also visited venues like [[CBGB]] to watch the likes of Patti Smith perform.<ref>[http://kevinegperry.com/2014/02/05/william-s-burroughs-at-100-thurston-moore-on-seeing-him-watch-patti-smith-at-cbgb-his-response-to-kurt-cobains-suicide-and-cut-up-songwriting/ Thurston Moore interview on William Burroughs]</ref> Throughout early 1977, Burroughs collaborated with Southern and [[Dennis Hopper]] on a screen adaptation of ''Junky''. Financed by a reclusive acquaintance of Burroughs, the project lost traction after financial problems and creative disagreements between Hopper and Burroughs.\n\nOrganized by Columbia professor [[Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer]], Giorno, and Grauerholz, the Nova Convention was a multimedia retrospective of Burroughs' work held from November 30 to December 2, 1978, at various locations throughout New York. The event included readings from Southern, Ginsberg, Smith, and [[Frank Zappa]] (who filled in at the last minute for [[Keith Richards]], then entangled in a legal problem), in addition to panel discussions with [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and concerts featuring [[The B-52's]], [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], [[Philip Glass]], and [[Debbie Harry]] and [[Chris Stein]].\n\nIn 1976, [[William S. Burroughs Jr.|Billy Burroughs]] was eating dinner with his father and Allen Ginsberg in [[Boulder, Colorado]], at Ginsberg's [[Buddhist]] poetry school ([[Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics]]) at [[Chogyam Trungpa]]'s [[Naropa University]] when he began to vomit blood. Burroughs senior had not seen his son for over a year and was alarmed at his appearance when Billy arrived at Ginsberg's apartment. Although Billy had successfully published two short novels in the 1970s, and was deemed by literary critics like [[Ann Charters]] as a bona fide \"second generation beat writer\",<ref>Charters, Ann. \"Introduction\". ''Speed/Kentucky Ham: Two Novels''. New York: Overlook Press, 1984.</ref> his brief marriage to a teenage waitress had disintegrated. Billy was a constant drinker, and there were long periods when he was out of contact with any of his family or friends. The diagnosis was [[liver cirrhosis]] so complete that the only treatment was a rarely performed liver transplant operation. Fortunately, the [[University of Colorado Health Sciences Center|University of Colorado Medical Center]] was one of two places in the nation that performed transplants under the pioneering work of Dr. [[Thomas Starzl]]. Billy underwent the procedure and beat the thirty-percent survival odds. His father spent time in 1976 and 1977 in Colorado, helping Billy through additional surgeries and complications. Ted Morgan's biography asserts that their relationship was not spontaneous and lacked real warmth or intimacy. Allen Ginsberg was supportive to both Burroughs and his son throughout the long period of recovery.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', pp. 495\u2013536.</ref>\n\nIn London, Burroughs had begun to write what would become the first novel of a trilogy, published as ''[[Cities of the Red Night]]'' (1981), ''[[The Place of Dead Roads]]'' (1983), and ''[[The Western Lands]]'' (1987). Grauerholz helped edit ''Cities'' when it was first rejected by Burroughs' long-time editor Dick Seaver at Holt Rinehart, after it was deemed too disjointed. The novel was written as a straight narrative and then chopped up into a more random pattern, leaving the reader to sort through the characters and events. This technique differed from the author's earlier cut-up methods, which were accidental from the start. Nevertheless, the novel was reassembled and published, still without a straight linear form, but with fewer breaks in the story. The trilogy featured time-travel adventures in which Burroughs' narrators rewrote episodes from history to reform mankind.<ref name=\"morgan565\">Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 565.</ref> Reviews were mixed for ''Cities''. Novelist and critic [[Anthony Burgess]] panned the work in ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'', saying Burroughs was boring readers with repetitive episodes of [[Pederasty|pederast]] fantasy and sexual strangulation that lacked any comprehensible [[world view]] or [[theology]]; other reviewers, like [[J. G. Ballard]], argued that Burroughs was shaping a new literary \"mythography\".<ref name=\"morgan565\" />\n\nIn 1981, Billy Burroughs died in Florida. He had cut off contact with his father several years before, even publishing an article in ''Esquire'' magazine claiming his father had poisoned his life and revealing that he had been molested as a fourteen-year-old by one of his father's friends while visiting Tangier. The [[Liver transplantation|liver transplant]] had not cured his urge to drink, and Billy suffered from serious health complications years after the operation. After he had stopped taking his [[immunosuppressive drug|transplant rejection drugs]], he was found near the side of a Florida highway by a stranger. He died shortly afterward. Burroughs was in New York when he heard from Allen Ginsberg of Billy's death.\n\nBurroughs, by 1979, was once again addicted to [[heroin]]. The cheap heroin that was easily purchased outside his door on the Lower East Side \"made its way\" into his veins, coupled with \"gifts\" from the overzealous if well-intentioned admirers who frequently visited the Bunker. Although Burroughs would have episodes of being free from heroin, from this point until his death he was regularly addicted to the drug. He died in 1997 on a [[methadone]] maintenance program. In an introduction to ''[[Last Words: The Final Journals of William S. Burroughs]]'', James Grauerholz (who managed Burroughs' reading tours in the 1980s and 1990s) mentions that part of his job was to deal with the \"underworld\" in each city to secure the author's needed drugs.<ref>Burroughs, William. \"Introduction\". ''Last Words: The Final Journals of William S. Burroughs''. New York: Grove Press, 2000.</ref>\n\n===Later years in Kansas===\n[[File:WilliamBurroughsinLawrence.png|thumb|upright|William S. Burroughs and James Grauerholz in the alley behind the Jazzhaus in Lawrence, Kansas (1996)]]\nBurroughs moved to [[Lawrence, Kansas]] in 1981, taking up residence at 1927 Learnard Avenue where he would spend the rest of his life. He once told a Wichita Eagle reporter that he was content to live in Kansas, saying, \"The thing I like about Kansas is that it's not nearly as violent, and it's a helluva lot cheaper. And I can get out in the country and fish and shoot and whatnot.\"<ref>[http://www.kansas.com/2010/04/05/1255296/godfather-of-beat-generation-was.html \"Godfather of Beat Generation was content to live last days in Kansas\"], ''Wichita Eagle and Kansas.com'', April 5, 2010.</ref> In 1984, he signed a seven-book deal with [[Viking Press]] after he signed with literary agent Andrew Wylie. This deal included the publication rights to the unpublished 1952 novel ''[[Queer (novel)|Queer]]''. With this money he purchased a small bungalow for $29,000.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 596.</ref> He was finally inducted into the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters|American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]] in 1983 after several attempts by Allen Ginsberg to get him accepted. He attended the induction ceremony in May 1983. [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] remarked the induction of Burroughs into the Academy proved [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s point that capitalistic society had a great ability to incorporate its one-time outsiders.<ref>Morgan, ''Literary Outlaw'', p. 577.</ref>\n\nBy this point, Burroughs was a counterculture icon. In his final years, he cultivated an entourage of young friends who replaced his aging contemporaries. He inspired 1970s [[proto-punk]] rock band [[Doctors of Madness]]. In the 1980s he collaborated with performers ranging from [[Bill Laswell]]'s [[Material (band)|Material]] and [[Laurie Anderson]] to [[Throbbing Gristle]], [[The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], and in [[Gus Van Sant]]'s 1989 film ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]],'' playing a character based on a short story he published in ''[[Exterminator!]]'', \"[[The \"Priest\" They Called Him]]\", featuring a guitar track supplied by [[Kurt Cobain]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Burroughs and R.E.M. collaborated on the song \"Star Me Kitten\" on the ''Songs in the Key of X: Music From and Inspired By The X-Files'' album. A collaboration with musicians [[Nick Cave]] and [[Tom Waits]] resulted in a collection of short prose, ''Smack My Crack'', later released as a spoken word album in 1987. In 1990, he released the spoken word album ''[[Dead City Radio]],'' with musical back-up from producers [[Hal Willner]] and Nelson Lyon, and [[alternative rock]] band [[Sonic Youth]]. He collaborated with Tom Waits and director [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] on ''[[The Black Rider]]'', a play which opened at the Thalia Theatre in [[Hamburg]] in 1990 to critical acclaim, and that was later performed all over Europe and the U.S. In 1991, with Burroughs' approval, director [[David Cronenberg]] adapted ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' into a feature film, which opened to critical acclaim.\n\nDuring 1982, Burroughs developed a painting technique whereby he created abstract compositions by placing spray paint cans in front of blank surfaces, and then shooting at the paint cans with a shotgun. These splattered and shot panels and canvasses were first exhibited in the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York City in 1987. By this time he had developed a comprehensive visual art practice, using ink, spray paint, collage and unusual things such as mushrooms and plungers to apply the paint. He created file-folder paintings featuring these mediums as well as \"automatic calligraphy\" inspired by Brion Gysin. He originally used the folders to mix pigments before observing that they could be viewed as art in themselves. He also used many of these painted folders to store manuscripts and correspondence in his personal archive <ref>[http://www.riflemaker.org/s-William-S-Burroughs William S. Burroughs 'Life-File' at Beak Street.]</ref>\nUntil his last years, he prolifically created visual art. Burroughs' work has since been featured in more than fifty international galleries and museums including Royal Academy of the Arts, Centre Pompidou, Guggenheim Museum, ZKM Karlsruhe, Sammlung Falckenberg, New Museum, Irish Museum of Modern Art, Los Angeles County Museum, and Whitney Museum of American Art.<ref>[http://www.octobergallery.co.uk/artists/burroughs/ \"William Burroughs Biography\"], [[October Gallery]].</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] frontman [[Al Jourgensen]], \"We hung out at Burroughs's house one time in '93. So he decides to shoot up [[heroin]] and he takes out this utility belt full of [[syringe]]s. Huge, old-fashioned ones from the '50s or something. Now, I have no idea how an 80 year old guy finds a vein, but he knew what he was doing. So we're all laying around high and stuff and then I notice in the pile of mail on the coffee table that there's a letter from the [[White House]]. I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's from [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, do you have any idea how big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was.\"<ref name=\"Uncle Al on Uncle Bill\">{{cite book|last1=Jourgensen|first1=Al|author-link=Al Jourgensen|last2=Wiederhorn|first2=Jon|title=Ministry: The Lost Gospels According To Al Jourgensen|date=July 9, 2013|publisher=Da Capo Press|ref=harv|lastauthoramp=y|isbn=9780306822186|via=Internet Archive|postscript=.

W. Norton & Company, 2012, p. 170</ref> Burroughs believed in frontier individualism, which he championed as \"our glorious frontier heritage on minding your own business.\" Burroughs came to equate liberalism with bureaucratic tyranny, viewing government authority as a collective of meddlesome forces legislating the curtailment of personal freedom. According to his biographer Ted Morgan, his philosophy for living one's life was to adhere to a laissez-faire path, one without encumbrances\u2014in essence a credo shared with the capitalist business world.<ref>Morgan, Ted, \"Literary Outlaw\", W. W. Norton & Company, 2012, p. 55</ref> His abhorrence of the government did not prevent Burroughs from using its programs to his own advantage. In 1949 he enrolled in [[Mexico City College]] under the [[GI Bill]], which paid for part of his tuition and books and provided him with a seventy-five-dollar-per-month stipend. He maintained, \"I always say, keep your snout in the public trough.\"<ref>Morgan, Ted, \"Literary Outlaw\", Morgan, Ted, W. W. Norton & Company, 2012, p. 173</ref>\n\nBurroughs was a gun enthusiast and owned several [[shotgun]]s, a [[Colt Single Action Army|Colt .45]] and a [[.38 special]]. [[Sonic Youth]] vocalist [[Thurston Moore]] recounted meeting Burroughs: \"he had a number of ''[[Guns and Ammo]]'' magazines laying about, and he was only very interested in talking about shooting and knifing...I asked him if he had a [[Beretta]] and he said: 'Ah, that's a ladies' pocket-purse gun. I like guns that shoot and knives that cut.\" [[Hunter S. Thompson]] gave him a one of a kind .454 caliber [[pistol]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rae |first1=Casey |title=William S.

''The Magical Universe of William S. Burroughs.'' Mandrake of Oxford.</ref> As he himself explained:\n\n<blockquote>In the magical universe there are no coincidences and there are no accidents. Nothing happens unless someone wills it to happen. The dogma of science is that the will cannot possibly affect external forces, and I think that's just ridiculous. It's as bad as the church. My viewpoint is the exact contrary of the scientific viewpoint. I believe that if you run into somebody in the street it's for a reason. Among primitive people they say that if someone was bitten by a snake he was murdered. I believe that.<ref>William S. Burroughs, quoted in Morgan, Ted (1988). ''Literary Outlaw.'' Pimlico.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOr, speaking in the 1970s:\n\n<blockquote>Since the word \"magic\" tends to cause confused thinking, I would like to say exactly what I mean by \"magic\" and the magical interpretation of so-called reality. The underlying assumption of magic is the assertion of \"will\" as the primary moving force in this universe - the deep conviction that nothing happens unless somebody or some being wills it to happen. To me this has always seemed self evident ... From the viewpoint of magic, no death, no illness, no misfortune, accident, war or riot is accidental. There are no accidents in the world of magic.<ref>William S. Burroughs, in conversation with Stephen Davis, ''Rock Magic'', Crawdaddy Magazine. 1975.

Perhaps events are pre-written and pre-recorded and when you cut word lines the future leaks out.<ref name=\"Burroughs\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn the final decade of his life, Burroughs became heavily involved in the [[chaos magic]] movement.

Retrieved March 3, 2008.</ref> Several of Burroughs early novels, including ''Junky'' and ''Naked Lunch,'' have been republished in posthumous \"Restored Text\" editions, incorporating material edited out of previous versions.\n\n==Literary style and periods==\nBurroughs' major works can be divided into four different periods. The dates refer to the time of writing, not publication, which in some cases was not until decades later:\n* '''Early work''' (early 1950s): ''[[Junkie (novel)|Junkie]]'', ''[[Queer (novel)|Queer]]'' and ''[[The Yage Letters]]'' are relatively straightforward linear narratives, written in and about Burroughs' time in Mexico City and South America.\n* '''The cut-up period''' (mid-1950s to mid-1960s): Although published before Burroughs discovered the [[cut-up technique]], ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' is a fragmentary collection of \"routines\" from ''[[The Word Hoard]]'' \u2013 manuscripts written in Tangier, Paris, London, as well as of other texts written in South America such as \"The Composite City\", blending into the [[Cut-up technique|cut-up and fold-in]] fiction also partly drawn from ''The Word Hoard'': ''[[The Soft Machine]]'', ''[[Nova Express]]'', ''[[The Ticket That Exploded]]'', also referred to as \"[[The Nova Trilogy]]\" or \"The Cut-Up Trilogy\", self-described by Burroughs as an attempt to create \"a mythology for the space age\". ''[[Interzone (book)|Interzone]]'' also derives from the mid-1950s.\n* '''Experiment and subversion''' (mid-1960s to mid-1970s): This period saw Burroughs continue experimental writing with increased political content and branching into multimedia such as film and sound recording. The only major novel written in this period was ''[[The Wild Boys (novel)|The Wild Boys]]'', but he also wrote dozens of published articles, short stories, scrap books and other works, several in collaboration with Brion Gysin. The major anthologies representing work from this period are ''[[The Burroughs File]]'', ''[[The Adding Machine: Collected Essays|The Adding Machine]]'' and ''[[Exterminator!]]''.\n* '''The ''Red Night'' trilogy''' (mid-1970s to mid-1980s): The books ''[[Cities of the Red Night]]'', ''[[The Place of Dead Roads]]'' and ''[[The Western Lands]]'' came from Burroughs in a final, mature stage, creating a complete mythology.\n\nBurroughs also produced numerous essays and a large body of autobiographical material, including a book with a detailed account of his own dreams (''My Education: A Book of Dreams'').\n\n===Reaction to critics and view on criticism===\nSeveral [[literary criticism|literary critics]] treated Burroughs' work harshly. For example, [[Anatole Broyard]] and [[Philip Toynbee]] wrote devastating reviews of some of his most important books. In a short essay entitled \"A Review of the Reviewers\", Burroughs answers his critics in this way:\n\n{{quote|Critics constantly complain that writers are lacking in standards, yet they themselves seem to have no standards other than personal prejudice for literary criticism. ... such standards do exist. [[Matthew Arnold]] set up three criteria for criticism: 1. What is the writer trying to do? 2. How well does he succeed in doing it? ... 3. Does the work exhibit \"high seriousness\"? That is, does it touch on basic issues of good and evil, life and death and the human condition. I would also apply a fourth criterion ... ''Write about what you know.'' More writers fail because they try to write about things they don't know than for any other reason.|William S. Burroughs|\"A Review of the Reviewers\"<ref>Burroughs, William S. ''The Adding Machine: Selected Essays''. Arcade Publishing, 1993</ref>}}\n\nBurroughs clearly indicates here that he prefers to be evaluated against such criteria over being reviewed based on the reviewer's personal reactions to a certain book. Always a contradictory figure, Burroughs nevertheless criticized Anatole Broyard for reading [[authorial intent]] into his works where there is none, which sets him at odds both with New Criticism and the old school as represented by Matthew Arnold.\n\n===Photography===\nBurroughs used photography extensively throughout his career, both as a recording medium in planning his writings, and as a significant dimension of his own artistic practice, in which photographs and other images feature as significant elements in cut-ups. With Ian Sommerville, he experimented with photography's potential as a form of memory-device, photographing and rephotographing his own pictures in increasingly complex time-image arrangements.<ref>Patricia Allmer and John Sears (ed.) ''Taking Shots: The Photography of William S. Burroughs'', London: Prestel and The Photographers' Gallery, 2014).</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nBurroughs is often called one of the greatest and most influential writers of the 20th century, most notably by [[Norman Mailer]] whose quote on Burroughs, \"The only American novelist living today who may conceivably be possessed by genius\", appears on many Burroughs publications. Others consider his concepts and attitude more influential than his [[prose]]. Prominent admirers of Burroughs' work have included British critic and biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]], the [[Music journalism|rock critic]] [[Lester Bangs]], the philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] and the authors [[J. G. Ballard]], [[Angela Carter]], [[Jean Genet]], [[William Gibson]], [[Alan Moore]], [[Kathy Acker]] and [[Ken Kesey]]. Burroughs had an influence on the German writer [[Carl Weissner]], who in addition to being his German translator was a novelist in his own right and frequently wrote cut-up texts in a manner reminiscent of Burroughs.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://realitystudio.org/publications/death-in-paris/in-memory-of-carl-weissner/ |title = In Memory of Carl Weissner |date = January 25, 2012 |publisher = Reality Studio |accessdate = February 25, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBurroughs continues to be named as an influence by contemporary writers of fiction. Both the [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]] and, especially, the [[cyberpunk]] schools of [[science fiction]] are indebted to him. Admirers from the late 1970s\u2014early 1980s milieu of this subgenre include [[William Gibson]] and [[John Shirley]], to name only two. First published in 1982, the British [[Slipstream (genre)|slipstream]] fiction magazine ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' (which later evolved into a more traditional [[science fiction magazine]]) paid tribute to him with its choice of name. He is also cited as a major influence by musicians [[Roger Waters]], [[David Bowie]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Genesis P-Orridge]], [[Ian Curtis]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kurt Cobain]].<ref>[http://www.beatdom.com/?p=620 Wills, D. 'Modern Beats: Tom Waits', in Wills, D. (ed.), ''Beatdom'', Vol. 3 (Dundee: Mauling Press, 2007) p. ????]</ref>\n\nDrugs, homosexuality, and death, common among Burroughs' themes, have been taken up by [[Dennis Cooper]], of whom Burroughs said, \"Dennis Cooper, God help him, is a born writer\".<ref>{{cite book |title = My Loose Thread |publisher = Canongate Books |author = Cooper, Dennis |year = 2003 |page = [https://archive.org/details/myloosethreadcoo00denn/page/1 1] |isbn = 9781841954127 |url = https://archive.org/details/myloosethreadcoo00denn/page/1 }}</ref> Cooper, in return, wrote, in his essay 'King Junk', \"along with [[Jean Genet]], [[John Rechy]], and [[Allen Ginsberg|Ginsberg]], [Burroughs] helped make homosexuality seem cool and highbrow, providing gay liberation with a delicious edge\". [[Splatterpunk]] writer [[Poppy Z. Brite]] has frequently referenced this aspect of Burroughs' work. Burroughs' writing continues to be referenced years after his death; for example, a November 2004 episode of the TV series ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' included an evil character named Dr. Benway (named for an amoral physician who appears in a number of Burroughs' works.) This is an echo of the hospital scene in the movie ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]],'' made during Burroughs' life-time, in which both Dr. Benway and Mr. Lee (a Burroughs pen name) are paged.\n\nBurroughs had an impact on twentieth-century esotericism and occultism as well, most notably through disciples like [[Peter Lamborn Wilson]] and Genesis P-Orridge. Burroughs is also cited by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] as the first person to notice the \"[[23 Enigma]]\":\n\n{{quote|I first heard of the 23 Enigma from William S. Burroughs, author of Naked Lunch, Nova Express, etc. According to Burroughs, he had known a certain Captain Clark, around 1960 in Tangier, who once bragged that he had been sailing 23 years without an accident. That very day, Clark's ship had an accident that killed him and everybody else aboard. Furthermore, while Burroughs was thinking about this crude example of the irony of the gods that evening, a bulletin on the radio announced the crash of an airliner in Florida, USA. The pilot was another Captain Clark and the flight was Flight 23.|Robert Anton Wilson|''[[Fortean Times]]''<ref>{{cite magazine |title = The 23 Phenomenon |author = Robert Anton Wilson |url = http://forteantimes.com/features/commentary/396/the_23_phenomenon.html |magazine = [[Fortean Times]] |date = May 2007 |accessdate = September 25, 2008 |authorlink = Robert Anton Wilson |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120526215723/http://forteantimes.com/features/commentary/396/the_23_phenomenon.html |archivedate = May 26, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>}}\n\nSome research<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cowan |first1=Tommy P |title=What Most People Would Call Evil: The Archontic Spirituality of William S.

Although never directly focusing on the year 2012 himself, Burroughs had an influence on early 2012 proponents such as [[Terence McKenna]] and [[Jose Arguelles|Jose Arg\u00fcelles]], and as well had written about an apocalyptic shift of human consciousness at the end of the Long Count as early as 1960's ''The Exterminator''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cowan |first1=Tommy P |title=\"What Most People Would Call Evil: The Archontic Spirituality of William S.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|on the cover]] of [[The Beatles]]' eighth studio album, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.\nBurroughs participated on numerous album releases by [[Giorno Poetry Systems]], including ''The Nova Convention'' (featuring [[Frank Zappa]], [[John Cage]], and [[Philip Glass]]) and ''You're the Guy I Want to Share My Money With'' (with [[John Giorno]] and [[Laurie Anderson]]).\n\nHe is featured in a spoken word piece entitled \"Sharkey's Night\" on Laurie Anderson's 1984 album ''[[Mister Heartbreak]]'', but the longer version of this track, with additional dialogue from Burroughs, was released only on a promotional 4-track 12\" Ep (Warner Bros PRO-A-2123). In addition, Burroughs provided vocal samples for the soundtrack of Anderson's 1986 [[concert film]], ''[[Home of the Brave (1986 film)|Home of the Brave]]'', and made a cameo appearance in it.\n\nBurroughs reads a passage from his novel ''[[Nova Express]]'' during the bridge of the title song from [[Todd Tamanend Clark]]'s 1984 album ''Into The Vision'', which also features [[Cheetah Chrome]] from [[The Dead Boys]] on guitar.\n\n[[Bill Laswell]]'s [[Material (band)|Material]] collaborated with Burroughs to produce the 1989 album ''[[Seven Souls (album)|Seven Souls]]'', wherein Burroughs recites passages from his book ''[[The Western Lands]]'' to musical accompaniment. The album was reissued in 1997 with 3 bonus remixes. In 1998, an additional unreleased six remixes (plus one previously released) were introduced on the album ''[[Seven Souls#The Road to the Western Lands|The Road To The Western Lands]]''. [[Spring Heel Jack]]'s remix of the track '\"The Road to the Western Lands\" from this album was also included on their ''Oddities'' album from 2000.\n\nIn 1990, [[Island Records]] released ''Dead City Radio'', a collection of readings set to a broad range of musical compositions. It was produced by [[Hal Willner]] and Nelson Lyon, with musical accompaniment from [[John Cale]], [[Donald Fagen]], [[Lenny Pickett]], [[Chris Stein]], Sonic Youth, and others. The remastered edition of Sonic Youth's album ''[[Goo (album)|Goo]]'' includes a longer version of \"Dr. Benway's House\", which had appeared, in shorter form, on ''Dead City Radio''.\n\nIn 1992 he recorded \"Quick Fix\" with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], which appeared on their single for \"[[Just One Fix]]\". The single featured cover art by Burroughs and a remix of the song dubbed the \"W.S.B. mix\". Burroughs also made an appearance in the video for \"Just One Fix\". The same year he also recorded the EP ''[[The \"Priest\" They Called Him]]''; Burroughs reads the [[Exterminator!|short story of the same name]], while [[Kurt Cobain]] creates layers of guitar feedback and distortion. [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] bassist [[Krist Novoselic]] is featured on the cover as the titular \"Priest\". The track on the 13th Ministry album \"Thanx but No Thanx\" makes use of William S. Burroughs' poem \"A Thanksgiving Prayer\", as read by Sgt. Major.\n\nIn 1992 Burroughs worked with [[The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy]] on ''[[Spare Ass Annie and Other Tales]]'', with the duo providing musical background and accompaniment to Burroughs' spoken readings from several of his books. A 12\" EP was released with five different remixes of the ''Spare Ass Annie'' track \"Words of Advice for Young People\", all done by Bill Laswell.\n\nBurroughs appears on two songs from ''[[Technodon]]'', the 1993 reunion album by the Japanese electronic group [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]. The opening track, \"Be a Superman\", begins with a sample of Burroughs proclaiming, \"Be a man! Be a human animal... be a superman! Be a superman.\" The latter part of the sample reappears throughout. \"I Tre Merli\" features a longer reading taken from ''The Job''.\n\nBurroughs recites the lyrics of [[R.E.M.]]'s \"Star Me Kitten\" for a special version of the song on the ''[[Songs in the Key of X: Music from and Inspired by the X-Files]]'' soundtrack.\n\nBurroughs appears near the end of [[U2]]'s music video \"[[Last Night on Earth (U2 song)|Last Night on Earth]]\", pushing a shopping cart with a large spotlight positioned inside it. The video ends with a close up of his eyes.\n\nBurroughs is featured on the 2000 compilation tribute album, ''[[Stoned Immaculate]]'', on a track that pairs Jim Morrison yelping and groaning with Burroughs reading Morrison's poetry. The music was recorded by the surviving Doors members in 2000 specifically for this album.<ref>''[[Stoned Immaculate: The Music of The Doors]]'' liner notes</ref>\n\nA Burroughs quote from a visualisation exercise called 'Take Nirvana'<ref>{{cite book|title= Refiguring Techniques in Digital Visual Research|url=https://books.google.com/?id=adsxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA121 |accessdate=11 April 2018|isbn=9783319612225|last1=Cruz|first1=Edgar G\u00f3mez|last2=Sumartojo|first2=Shanti|last3=Pink|first3=Sarah|date=2017-08-20}}</ref> was used by director [[Shane Meadows]] in the final scene of [[The Stone Roses]]' 2013 concert DVD, ''[[The Stone Roses: Made of Stone|Made of Stone]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title= Phoenix New Times|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/how-made-of-stone-explains-the-stone-roses-and-the-death-of-rave-culture-6622505|publisher=phoenixnewtimes.com|accessdate=11 April 2018|date=2013-12-11}}</ref>\n\n=====Band names=====\nNumerous bands have found their names in Burroughs' work. The most widely known of these is [[Steely Dan]], a group named after a [[dildo]] in ''[[Naked Lunch]]''.<ref>[http://www.steelydan.com/faq.html FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64t7qffjJ?url=http://www.steelydan.com/faq.html |date=January 22, 2012 }} from the Official [[Steely Dan]] website</ref> Also from ''Naked Lunch'' came the names [[Clarknova]], [[The Mugwumps (band)|The Mugwumps]] and [[The Insect Trust]].

In 1968, an abbreviated\u201477 minutes as opposed to the original's 104 minutes\u2014version of [[Benjamin Christensen]]'s 1922 film ''[[H\u00e4xan]]'' was released, subtitled ''Witchcraft Through The Ages''.

The film is perhaps the definitive account of Burroughs' life, and Brookner and Burroughs maintained a very close collaboration during the shooting process. The film features interviews with many of Burroughs' friends and collaborators including [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Brion Gysin]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Herbert Huncke]], [[Patti Smith]] and [[Terry Southern]].\n\nBurroughs subsequently made [[cameo appearance]]s in a number of other films and videos, such as [[David Blair (director)|David Blair]]'s ''[[Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees]]'', an elliptic story about the first [[Gulf War]] in which Burroughs plays a beekeeper, and ''[[Decoder (film)|Decoder]]'' by Klaus Maeck. He played an aging junkie priest in [[Gus Van Sant]]'s 1989 film ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]''. He also appears briefly at the beginning of Van Sant's ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]'' (based on the Tom Robbins [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (novel)|novel]]), in which he is seen crossing a city street; as the noise of the city rises around him he pauses in the middle of the intersection and speaks the single word \"ominous\". Van Sant's short film \"Thanksgiving Prayer\" features Burroughs reading the poem \"Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 28, 1986\", from ''[[Tornado Alley (book)|Tornado Alley]]'', intercut with a collage of black and white images.\n\nBurroughs was portrayed by [[Kiefer Sutherland]] in the 2000 film ''[[Beat (2000 film)|Beat]]'', written and directed by Gary Walkow. Loosely biographical, the plot involves a car trip to Mexico City with Vollmer, Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Lucien Carr, and includes a scene of Vollmer's shooting.\n\nBurroughs is portrayed by [[Ben Foster]] in the 2013 film ''[[Kill Your Darlings (2013 film)|Kill Your Darlings]]'', directed by John Krokidas and written by John Krokidas and Austin Bunn. The film tells the story of Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan) and David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall), with appearances by actors playing Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) and Kerouac (Jack Huston).<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/movies/kill-your-darlings-stars-daniel-radcliffe.html?src=dayp&pagewanted=2 \"The Watchful Years, Before the Howling Began\" (movie review)], ''The New York Times'', October 15, 2013.</ref>\n\nNear the end of his life, recordings of Burroughs reading his short stories \"A Junky's Christmas\" and \"Ah Pook Is Here\" were used on the soundtracks of two highly acclaimed animated films.<ref>[http://www.beatdom.com/?p=701 Wills, David, \"Naked Lunch on Film\" in ''Beatdom'', Vol. 5 (City of Recovery Press, 2009), p. 30.]</ref>\n\nFilmmakers Lars Movin and Steen Moller Rasmussen used footage of Burroughs taken during a 1983 tour of Scandinavia in the documentary ''[[Words of Advice: William S. Burroughs on the Road]]''. A 2010 documentary, ''William S. Burroughs: A Man Within'', was made for [[Independent Lens]] on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].\n\n''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' (released in December 1997) was dedicated to Burroughs, as well as Ginsberg, who died four months earlier.<ref name=\"ES-19980303\">{{cite web |last1=Clarke |first1=Roger |title=Roger Clarke {{!}} Gus Van Sant |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/film/roger-clarke-6331844.html |website=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=May 18, 2019 |date=March 3, 1998}}</ref>\n\n====As a fictional character====\nBurroughs was fictionalized in Jack Kerouac's [[autobiographical novel]] ''[[On the Road]]'' as \"Old Bull Lee\". He also makes an appearance in [[J. G. Ballard]]'s semi-autobiographical 1991 novel ''[[The Kindness of Women]]''. In the 2004 novel ''[[Move Under Ground]]'', Burroughs, Kerouac, and [[Neal Cassady]] team up to defeat [[Cthulhu]].\n\nBurroughs appears in the first part of ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and Robert Anton Wilson during the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] riots and is described as a person devoid of anger, passion, indignation, hope, or any other recognizable human emotion. He is presented as a polar opposite of [[Allen Ginsberg]], as Ginsberg believed in everything and Burroughs believed in nothing. Wilson would recount in his ''[[Cosmic Trigger II: Down to Earth]]'' having interviewed both Burroughs and Ginsberg for ''[[Playboy]]'' the day the riots began, as well as his experiences with Shea during the riots, providing details on the creation of the fictional sequence.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Wilson |first1 = Robert Anton |title = Cosmic Trigger Volume 2, Down to Earth |publisher = New Falcon Publications |date = 1993 |page = 37 |isbn = 978-1561840113 }}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Main|William S.

People often choose to conform to society rather than to pursue personal desires because it is often easier to follow the path others have made already, rather than creating a new one. This tendency to conform occurs in small groups and/or society as a whole, and may result from subtle unconscious influences (predisposed state of mind), or direct and overt [[social pressure]]. Conformity can occur in the presence of others, or when an individual is alone. For example, people tend to follow social norms when eating or watching television, even when alone.\n\nPeople often conform from a desire for security within a group\u2014typically a group of a similar age, culture, religion, or educational status. This is often referred to as [[groupthink]]: a pattern of thought characterized by self-deception, forced manufacture of consent, and conformity to group values and ethics, which ignores realistic appraisal of other courses of action. Unwillingness to conform carries the risk of [[social rejection]]. Conformity is often associated with adolescence and [[youth culture]], but strongly affects humans of all ages.<ref>{{cite website|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=What is Conformity?|website =Simply Psychology|date=2016|url = https://www.simplypsychology.org/conformity.html}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[peer pressure]] may manifest negatively, conformity can be regarded as either good or bad.

These types of responses to conformity vary in their degree of public agreement versus private agreement.\n\nWhen an individual finds themselves in a position where they publicly agree with the group's decision yet privately disagrees with the group's consensus, they are experiencing ''compliance'' or ''acquiescence''.  In turn, ''conversion'', otherwise known as ''private acceptance'', involves both publicly and privately agreeing with the group's decision. Thus, this represents a true change of opinion to match the majority.\n\nAnother type of social response, which does not involve conformity with the majority of the group, is called ''convergence''. In this type of social response, the group member agrees with the group's decision from the outset and thus does not need to shift their opinion on the matter at hand.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D. R. 2009\">{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D. R.|title=Group dynamics|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=New York|isbn=978-1-133-95653-2}} [Chapter 7]</ref>\n\nIn addition, Forsyth shows that nonconformity can also fall into one of two response categories. Firstly, an individual who does not conform to the majority can display ''independence''. ''Independence'', or ''dissent'', can be defined as the unwillingness to bend to group pressures. Thus, this individual stays true to his or her personal standards instead of the swaying toward group standards. Secondly, a nonconformist could be displaying ''[[Anticonformity (psychology)|anticonformity]]'' or ''counterconformity'' which involves the taking of opinions that are opposite to what the group believes. This type of nonconformity can be motivated by a need to rebel against the status quo instead of the need to be accurate in one's opinion.\n\nTo conclude, social responses to conformity can be seen to vary along a continuum from conversion to anticonformity. For example, a popular experiment in conformity research, known as the ''Asch situation'' or [[Asch conformity experiments]], primarily includes ''compliance'' and ''independence''. Also, other responses to conformity can be identified in groups such as juries, sports teams and work teams.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D. R. 2009\" />\n\n== Main experiments ==\n\n=== Sherif's experiment (1936) ===\nMuzafer Sherif was interested in knowing how many people would change their opinions to bring them in line with the opinion of a group. In his experiment, participants were placed in a dark room and asked to stare at a small dot of light 15 feet away. They were then asked to estimate the amount it moved. The trick was there was no movement, it was caused by a visual illusion known as the [[autokinetic effect]]. On the first day, each person perceived different amounts of movement, but from the second to the fourth day, the same estimate was agreed on and others conformed to it.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\">{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=M. A.|title=Social psychology|year=2005|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Harlow|author2=Vaughan, G. M.}}</ref> Sherif suggested this was a simulation for how social norms develop in a society, providing a common frame of reference for people.\n\nSubsequent experiments were based on more realistic situations. In an eyewitness identification task, participants were shown a suspect individually and then in a lineup of other suspects. They were given one second to identify him, making it a difficult task. One group was told that their input was very important and would be used by the legal community. To the other it was simply a trial. Being more motivated to get the right answer increased the tendency to conform. Those who wanted to be more accurate conformed 51% of the time as opposed to 35% in the other group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baron|first=R. S. |author2=Vandello, J.

Asch conducted a modification of Sherif's study, assuming that when the situation was very clear, conformity would be drastically reduced. He exposed people in a group to a series of lines, and the participants were asked to match one line with a standard line. All participants except one were accomplices and gave the wrong answer in 12 of the 18 trials.<ref name=\"Asch 1955 31\u201335\" />\n\nThe results showed a surprisingly high degree of conformity: 74% of the participants conformed on at least one trial.

However, the increasing majority was only influential up to a point: from three or more opponents, there is more than 30% of conformity.<ref name=\"Asch 1955 31\u201335\" />\n\n== Varieties ==\nHarvard psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] identified three major types of conformity.<ref name=\"Kelman 1958 51\u201360\">{{cite journal|last=Kelman|first=H. C|title=Compliance, Identification, and Internalization: Three Processes of Attitude Change|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=1958|volume=2|issue=1|pages=51\u201360|doi=10.1177/002200275800200106}}</ref>\n* ''[[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]]'' is public conformity, while possibly keeping one's own original beliefs for yourself. Compliance is motivated by the need for approval and the fear of being rejected.\n* ''[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]]'' is conforming to someone who is liked and respected, such as a celebrity or a favorite uncle. This can be motivated by the attractiveness of the source,<ref name=\"Kelman 1958 51\u201360\" /> and this is a deeper type of conformism than compliance.\n* ''[[Internalization]]'' is accepting the belief or behavior and conforming both publicly and privately, if the source is credible. It is the deepest influence on people and it will affect them for a long time.\n\nAlthough Kelman's distinction has been influential, research in [[Social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] has focused primarily on two varieties of conformity. These are ''informational'' conformity, or [[informational social influence]], and ''normative'' conformity, also called [[normative social influence]]. In Kelman's terminology, these correspond to internalization and compliance, respectively. There are naturally more than two or three variables in society influential on human [[psychology]] and conformity; the notion of \"varieties\" of conformity based upon \"social influence\" is ambiguous and indefinable in this context.\n\nFor Deutsch and G\u00e9rard (1955), conformity results from a motivational conflict  (between the fear of being socially rejected and the wish to say what we think is correct) that leads to the normative influence, and a cognitive conflict (others create doubts in what we think) which leads to the informational influence.<ref name=\"Deutsch 1955 629\u2013636\">{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=M|author2=G\u00e9rard, H. B|title=A study of normative and informational social influences upon individual judgement|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|year=1955|volume=51|issue=3|pages=629\u2013636|doi=10.1037/h0046408|pmid=13286010}}</ref>\n\n=== Informational influence ===\n{{Main|Informational social influence}}\nInformational social influence occurs when one turns to the members of one's group to obtain and accept accurate information about reality. A person is most likely to use informational social influence in certain situations: when a situation is ambiguous, people become uncertain about what to do and they are more likely to depend on others for the answer; and during a crisis when immediate action is necessary, in spite of panic. Looking to other people can help ease fears, but unfortunately they are not always right. The more knowledgeable a person is, the more valuable they are as a resource. Thus people often turn to [[expert]]s for help. But once again people must be careful, as experts can make mistakes too. Informational social influence often results in ''internalization'' or ''private acceptance'', where a person genuinely believes that the information is right.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\" />\n\n=== Normative influence ===\n{{Main|Normative social influence}}\nNormative social influence occurs when one conforms to be liked or accepted by the members of the group. This need of social approval and acceptance is part of our state of humans.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\" /> In addition to this, we know that when people do not conform with their group and therefore are deviants, they are less liked and even punished by the group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schachter|first=S|title=Deviation, Rejection, and communication|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1951|volume=46|issue=2|pages=190\u2013208|doi=10.1037/h0062326}}</ref> Normative influence usually results in ''public compliance'', doing or saying something without believing in it. The experiment of Asch in 1951 is one example of normative influence. Even though John Turner et al argued that the post experimental interviews showed that the respondents were uncertain about the correct answers in some cases. The answers might have been evident to the experimenters but the participants did not have the same experience. Subsequent studies pointed out the fact that the participants were not known to each other and therefore did not pose a threat against social rejection.  [[Asch conformity experiments|Normative influence vs. referent informational influence]]\nIn a reinterpretation of the original data from these [[Asch conformity experiments|experiments]] Hodges and Geyer (2006)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hodges|first=B. H.|author2=Geyer, A.

They also provide compelling evidence of people's concern for others and their views.\nBy closely examining the situation in which Asch's subjects find themselves they find that the situation places multiple demands on participants: They include truth (i.e., expressing one's own view accurately), trust (i.e., taking seriously the value of others' claims), and social solidarity (i.e., a commitment to integrate the views of self and others without deprecating either). In addition to these epistemic values, there are multiple moral claims as well: These include the need for participants to care for the integrity and well-being of other participants, the experimenter, themselves, and the worth of scientific research.\n\nDeutsch & G\u00e9rard (1955) designed different situations that variated from Asch' experiment and found that when participants were writing their answer privately, they were giving the correct one<ref name=\"Deutsch 1955 629\u2013636\" />\n\nNormative influence, a function of [[social impact theory]], has three components.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Latan\u00e9|first=B|title=The psychology of social impact|journal=American Psychologist|year=1981|volume=36|issue=4|pages=343\u2013356|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.36.4.343}}</ref> The ''number of people'' in the group has a surprising effect. As the number increases, each person has less of an impact. A group's ''strength'' is how important the group is to a person. Groups we value generally have more social influence. ''Immediacy'' is how close the group is in time and space when the influence is taking place. Psychologists have constructed a mathematical model using these three factors and are able to predict the amount of conformity that occurs with some degree of accuracy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forgas|first=J.

Each participant had five seconds to look at a slide instead of just one second. Once again, there were both high and low motives to be accurate, but the results were the reverse of the first study. The low motivation group conformed 33% of the time (similar to Asch's findings). The high motivation group conformed less at 16%. These results show that when accuracy is not very important, it is better to get the wrong answer than to risk social disapproval.\n\nAn experiment using procedures similar to Asch's found that there was significantly less conformity in six-person groups of [[friend]]s as compared to six-person groups of strangers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKelvey|first=W.|author2=Kerr, N.

This is known as ''minority influence'', a special case of informational influence. Minority influence is most likely when people can make a clear and consistent case for their point of view. If the minority fluctuates and shows uncertainty, the chance of influence is small. However, a minority that makes a strong, convincing case increases the probability of changing  the majority's beliefs and behaviors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moscovici|first=S. N.|title=\"Minority influence\". Social psychology: Classic and contemporary integrations|year=1974|publisher=Rand McNally|location=Chicago|pages=217\u2013249}}</ref> Minority members who are perceived as experts, are high in status, or have benefited the group in the past are also more likely to succeed.\n\nAnother form of minority influence can sometimes override conformity effects and lead to unhealthy group dynamics. A 2007 review of two dozen studies by the University of Washington found that a single \"bad apple\" (an inconsiderate or negligent group member) can substantially increase conflicts and reduce performance in work groups. Bad apples often create a negative emotional climate that interferes with healthy group functioning. They can be avoided by careful selection procedures and managed by reassigning them to positions that require less social interaction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Felps|first=W|author2=Mitchell, T R. |author3=Byington, E |title=How, When, and Why Bad Apples Spoil the Barrel: Negative Group Members and Dysfunctional|journal=GroupsResearch in Organizational Behavior|year=2006|volume=27|pages=175\u2013222|doi=10.1016/s0191-3085(06)27005-9}}</ref>\n\n== Specific predictors ==\n\n=== Culture ===\n[[Stanley Milgram]] found that individuals in Norway (from a collectivistic culture) exhibited a higher degree of conformity than individuals in France (from an individualistic culture).<ref name=\"Milgram\">{{cite journal | last1 = Milgram | first1 = S | year = 1961 | title = Nationality and conformity | url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | journal = Scientific American | volume = 205 | issue =  6| page = 6 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121004201132/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | archivedate = 2012-10-04 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1261-45 | bibcode = 1961SciAm.205f..45M }}</ref> Similarly, Berry studied two different populations: the Temne (collectivists) and the Inuit (individualists) and found that the Temne conformed more than the Inuit when exposed to a conformity task.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=J W.|title=Independence and conformity in subsistence-level societies|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1967|volume=7|issue=4, Pt.1|pages=415\u2013418|doi=10.1037/h0025231}}</ref>\n\nBond and Smith compared 134 studies in a meta-analysis and found that there is a positive correlation between a country's level of collectivistic values and conformity rates in the Asch paradigm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=M.

However, this view was not formed on the basis of [[Scientific method|empirical evidence collected in a systematic way]], but rather on the basis of anecdotes and casual observations, which are subject to a variety of [[cognitive bias]]es. Modern scientific studies comparing conformity in Japan and the United States show that Americans conform in general as much than the Japanese and, in some situations, even more. Psychology professor [[:ja:\u9ad8\u91ce\u967d\u592a\u90ce|Yohtaro Takano]] from the [[University of Tokyo]], along with Eiko Osaka reviewed four behavioral studies and found that the rate of conformity errors that the Japanese subjects manifested in the Asch paradigm was similar with that manifested by Americans.<ref>Takano, Y., & Osaka, E.

In a study by Reitan and Shaw, it was found that men and women conformed more when there were participants of both sexes involved versus participants of the same sex.

However, there were no gender differences in conformity among participants who were under 19 years of age and in surveillance conditions. There were also no gender differences when participants were not under surveillance. In a subsequent research article, Eagly suggests that women are more likely to conform than men because of lower status roles of women in society.

Milgram also conducted the same experiment once more, but told participants that the results of the study would be applied to the design of aircraft safety signals. His conformity estimates were 56% in Norway and 46% in France, suggesting that individuals conformed slightly less when the task was linked to an important issue.

People often choose to conform to society rather than to pursue personal desires because it is often easier to follow the path others have made already, rather than creating a new one. This tendency to conform occurs in small groups and/or society as a whole, and may result from subtle unconscious influences (predisposed state of mind), or direct and overt [[social pressure]]. Conformity can occur in the presence of others, or when an individual is alone. For example, people tend to follow social norms when eating or watching television, even when alone.\n\nPeople often conform from a desire for security within a group\u2014typically a group of a similar age, culture, religion, or educational status. This is often referred to as [[groupthink]]: a pattern of thought characterized by self-deception, forced manufacture of consent, and conformity to group values and ethics, which ignores realistic appraisal of other courses of action. Unwillingness to conform carries the risk of [[social rejection]]. Conformity is often associated with adolescence and [[youth culture]], but strongly affects humans of all ages.<ref>{{cite website|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=What is Conformity?|website =Simply Psychology|date=2016|url = https://www.simplypsychology.org/conformity.html}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[peer pressure]] may manifest negatively, conformity can be regarded as either good or bad.

These types of responses to conformity vary in their degree of public agreement versus private agreement.\n\nWhen an individual finds themselves in a position where they publicly agree with the group's decision yet privately disagrees with the group's consensus, they are experiencing ''compliance'' or ''acquiescence''.  In turn, ''conversion'', otherwise known as ''private acceptance'', involves both publicly and privately agreeing with the group's decision. Thus, this represents a true change of opinion to match the majority.\n\nAnother type of social response, which does not involve conformity with the majority of the group, is called ''convergence''. In this type of social response, the group member agrees with the group's decision from the outset and thus does not need to shift their opinion on the matter at hand.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D. R. 2009\">{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D. R.|title=Group dynamics|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=New York|isbn=978-1-133-95653-2}} [Chapter 7]</ref>\n\nIn addition, Forsyth shows that nonconformity can also fall into one of two response categories. Firstly, an individual who does not conform to the majority can display ''independence''. ''Independence'', or ''dissent'', can be defined as the unwillingness to bend to group pressures. Thus, this individual stays true to his or her personal standards instead of the swaying toward group standards. Secondly, a nonconformist could be displaying ''[[Anticonformity (psychology)|anticonformity]]'' or ''counterconformity'' which involves the taking of opinions that are opposite to what the group believes. This type of nonconformity can be motivated by a need to rebel against the status quo instead of the need to be accurate in one's opinion.\n\nTo conclude, social responses to conformity can be seen to vary along a continuum from conversion to anticonformity. For example, a popular experiment in conformity research, known as the ''Asch situation'' or [[Asch conformity experiments]], primarily includes ''compliance'' and ''independence''. Also, other responses to conformity can be identified in groups such as juries, sports teams and work teams.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D. R. 2009\" />\n\n== Main experiments ==\n\n=== Sherif's experiment (1936) ===\nMuzafer Sherif was interested in knowing how many people would change their opinions to bring them in line with the opinion of a group. In his experiment, participants were placed in a dark room and asked to stare at a small dot of light 15 feet away. They were then asked to estimate the amount it moved. The trick was there was no movement, it was caused by a visual illusion known as the [[autokinetic effect]]. On the first day, each person perceived different amounts of movement, but from the second to the fourth day, the same estimate was agreed on and others conformed to it.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\">{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=M.

In an eyewitness identification task, participants were shown a suspect individually and then in a lineup of other suspects. They were given one second to identify him, making it a difficult task. One group was told that their input was very important and would be used by the legal community. To the other it was simply a trial. Being more motivated to get the right answer increased the tendency to conform. Those who wanted to be more accurate conformed 51% of the time as opposed to 35% in the other group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baron|first=R. S. |author2=Vandello, J.

Asch conducted a modification of Sherif's study, assuming that when the situation was very clear, conformity would be drastically reduced. He exposed people in a group to a series of lines, and the participants were asked to match one line with a standard line. All participants except one were accomplices and gave the wrong answer in 12 of the 18 trials.<ref name=\"Asch 1955 31\u201335\" />\n\nThe results showed a surprisingly high degree of conformity: 74% of the participants conformed on at least one trial.

However, the increasing majority was only influential up to a point: from three or more opponents, there is more than 30% of conformity.<ref name=\"Asch 1955 31\u201335\" />\n\n== Varieties ==\nHarvard psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] identified three major types of conformity.<ref name=\"Kelman 1958 51\u201360\">{{cite journal|last=Kelman|first=H. C|title=Compliance, Identification, and Internalization: Three Processes of Attitude Change|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=1958|volume=2|issue=1|pages=51\u201360|doi=10.1177/002200275800200106}}</ref>\n* ''[[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]]'' is public conformity, while possibly keeping one's own original beliefs for yourself. Compliance is motivated by the need for approval and the fear of being rejected.\n* ''[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]]'' is conforming to someone who is liked and respected, such as a celebrity or a favorite uncle. This can be motivated by the attractiveness of the source,<ref name=\"Kelman 1958 51\u201360\" /> and this is a deeper type of conformism than compliance.\n* ''[[Internalization]]'' is accepting the belief or behavior and conforming both publicly and privately, if the source is credible. It is the deepest influence on people and it will affect them for a long time.\n\nAlthough Kelman's distinction has been influential, research in [[Social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] has focused primarily on two varieties of conformity. These are ''informational'' conformity, or [[informational social influence]], and ''normative'' conformity, also called [[normative social influence]]. In Kelman's terminology, these correspond to internalization and compliance, respectively. There are naturally more than two or three variables in society influential on human [[psychology]] and conformity; the notion of \"varieties\" of conformity based upon \"social influence\" is ambiguous and indefinable in this context.\n\nFor Deutsch and G\u00e9rard (1955), conformity results from a motivational conflict  (between the fear of being socially rejected and the wish to say what we think is correct) that leads to the normative influence, and a cognitive conflict (others create doubts in what we think) which leads to the informational influence.<ref name=\"Deutsch 1955 629\u2013636\">{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=M|author2=G\u00e9rard, H.

A person is most likely to use informational social influence in certain situations: when a situation is ambiguous, people become uncertain about what to do and they are more likely to depend on others for the answer; and during a crisis when immediate action is necessary, in spite of panic. Looking to other people can help ease fears, but unfortunately they are not always right. The more knowledgeable a person is, the more valuable they are as a resource. Thus people often turn to [[expert]]s for help. But once again people must be careful, as experts can make mistakes too. Informational social influence often results in ''internalization'' or ''private acceptance'', where a person genuinely believes that the information is right.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\" />\n\n=== Normative influence ===\n{{Main|Normative social influence}}\nNormative social influence occurs when one conforms to be liked or accepted by the members of the group. This need of social approval and acceptance is part of our state of humans.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\" /> In addition to this, we know that when people do not conform with their group and therefore are deviants, they are less liked and even punished by the group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schachter|first=S|title=Deviation, Rejection, and communication|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1951|volume=46|issue=2|pages=190\u2013208|doi=10.1037/h0062326}}</ref> Normative influence usually results in ''public compliance'', doing or saying something without believing in it. The experiment of Asch in 1951 is one example of normative influence. Even though John Turner et al argued that the post experimental interviews showed that the respondents were uncertain about the correct answers in some cases. The answers might have been evident to the experimenters but the participants did not have the same experience. Subsequent studies pointed out the fact that the participants were not known to each other and therefore did not pose a threat against social rejection.  [[Normative influence vs. referent informational influence]]\n\nIn a reinterpretation of the original data from these [[Asch conformity experiments|experiments]] Hodges and Geyer (2006)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hodges|first=B. H.|author2=Geyer, A. L.|title=A Nonconformist Account of the Asch Experiments: Values, Pragmatics, and Moral Dilemmas|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=2\u201319|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1001_1|pmid=16430326}}</ref>  found that Asch's subjects were not so conformist after all: The experiments provide powerful evidence for people's tendency to tell the truth even when others do not. They also provide compelling evidence of people's concern for others and their views.\nBy closely examining the situation in which Asch's subjects find themselves they find that the situation places multiple demands on participants: They include truth (i.e., expressing one's own view accurately), trust (i.e., taking seriously the value of others' claims), and social solidarity (i.e., a commitment to integrate the views of self and others without deprecating either). In addition to these epistemic values, there are multiple moral claims as well: These include the need for participants to care for the integrity and well-being of other participants, the experimenter, themselves, and the worth of scientific research.\n\nDeutsch & G\u00e9rard (1955) designed different situations that variated from Asch' experiment and found that when participants were writing their answer privately, they were giving the correct one<ref name=\"Deutsch 1955 629\u2013636\" />\n\nNormative influence, a function of [[social impact theory]], has three components.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Latan\u00e9|first=B|title=The psychology of social impact|journal=American Psychologist|year=1981|volume=36|issue=4|pages=343\u2013356|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.36.4.343}}</ref> The ''number of people'' in the group has a surprising effect. As the number increases, each person has less of an impact. A group's ''strength'' is how important the group is to a person. Groups we value generally have more social influence. ''Immediacy'' is how close the group is in time and space when the influence is taking place. Psychologists have constructed a mathematical model using these three factors and are able to predict the amount of conformity that occurs with some degree of accuracy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forgas|first=J.

D}}</ref>\n\nBaron and his colleagues conducted a second ''eyewitness study'' that focused on normative influence. In this version, the task was easier. Each participant had five seconds to look at a slide instead of just one second. Once again, there were both high and low motives to be accurate, but the results were the reverse of the first study. The low motivation group conformed 33% of the time (similar to Asch's findings). The high motivation group conformed less at 16%. These results show that when accuracy is not very important, it is better to get the wrong answer than to risk social disapproval.\n\nAn experiment using procedures similar to Asch's found that there was significantly less conformity in six-person groups of [[friend]]s as compared to six-person groups of strangers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKelvey|first=W.|author2=Kerr, N. H.|title=Differences in conformity among friends and strangers|journal=Psychological Reports|year=1988|volume=62|issue=3|pages=759\u2013762|doi=10.2466/pr0.1988.62.3.759}}</ref> Because friends already know and accept each other, there may be less normative pressure to conform in some situations.

This is known as ''minority influence'', a special case of informational influence. Minority influence is most likely when people can make a clear and consistent case for their point of view. If the minority fluctuates and shows uncertainty, the chance of influence is small. However, a minority that makes a strong, convincing case increases the probability of changing  the majority's beliefs and behaviors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moscovici|first=S. N.|title=\"Minority influence\".

A 2007 review of two dozen studies by the University of Washington found that a single \"bad apple\" (an inconsiderate or negligent group member) can substantially increase conflicts and reduce performance in work groups. Bad apples often create a negative emotional climate that interferes with healthy group functioning. They can be avoided by careful selection procedures and managed by reassigning them to positions that require less social interaction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Felps|first=W|author2=Mitchell, T R. |author3=Byington, E |title=How, When, and Why Bad Apples Spoil the Barrel: Negative Group Members and Dysfunctional|journal=GroupsResearch in Organizational Behavior|year=2006|volume=27|pages=175\u2013222|doi=10.1016/s0191-3085(06)27005-9}}</ref>\n\n== Specific predictors ==\n\n=== Culture ===\n[[Stanley Milgram]] found that individuals in Norway (from a collectivistic culture) exhibited a higher degree of conformity than individuals in France (from an individualistic culture).<ref name=\"Milgram\">{{cite journal | last1 = Milgram | first1 = S | year = 1961 | title = Nationality and conformity | url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | journal = Scientific American | volume = 205 | issue =  6| page = 6 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121004201132/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | archivedate = 2012-10-04 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1261-45 | bibcode = 1961SciAm.205f..45M }}</ref> Similarly, Berry studied two different populations: the Temne (collectivists) and the Inuit (individualists) and found that the Temne conformed more than the Inuit when exposed to a conformity task.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=J W.|title=Independence and conformity in subsistence-level societies|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1967|volume=7|issue=4, Pt.1|pages=415\u2013418|doi=10.1037/h0025231}}</ref>\n\nBond and Smith compared 134 studies in a meta-analysis and found that there is a positive correlation between a country's level of collectivistic values and conformity rates in the Asch paradigm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=M.

However, this view was not formed on the basis of [[Scientific method|empirical evidence collected in a systematic way]], but rather on the basis of anecdotes and casual observations, which are subject to a variety of [[cognitive bias]]es.

In a study by Reitan and Shaw, it was found that men and women conformed more when there were participants of both sexes involved versus participants of the same sex. Subjects in the groups with both sexes were more apprehensive when there was a discrepancy amongst group members, and thus the subjects reported that they doubted their own judgments.<ref name=\"Reitan, 1964 45\u201351\" />\nSistrunk and McDavid made the argument that women conformed more because of a methodological bias.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sistrunk|first=F|author2=McDavid, J.

For example, research with Australian children and adolescents ages 3 to 17 discovered that conformity decreases with age.<ref name=\"WalkerMB\">{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Walker | first1 = M.\n| last2 = Andrade | first2 = M.\n| doi = 10.1080/00224545.1996.9714014\n| title = Conformity in the Asch Task as a Function of Age\n| journal = The Journal of Social Psychology\n| volume = 136\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 367\u2013372\n| year = 1996\n| pmid = 8758616\n| pmc =\n}}</ref> Another study examined individuals that were ranged from ages 18 to 91.<ref name=\"Pasupathi\">{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.14.1.170\n| last1 = Pasupathi | first1 = M.\n| title = Age differences in response to conformity pressure for emotional and nonemotional material\n| journal = Psychology and Aging\n| volume = 14\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 170\u2013174\n| year = 1999\n| pmid = 10224640\n}}</ref> The results revealed a similar trend&nbsp;\u2013 older participants displayed less conformity when compared to younger participants.\n\nIn the same way that gender has been viewed as corresponding to status, age has also been argued to have status implications. Berger, Rosenholtz and Zelditch suggest that age as a status role can be observed among college students. Younger students, such as those in their first year in college, are treated as lower-status individuals and older college students are treated as higher-status individuals.<ref name=\"Berger1980\">{{cite journal | last1 = Berger | first1 = J. | last2 = Rosenholtz | first2 = S.J. | last3 = Zelditch | first3 = M. | year = 1980 | title = Status organizing processes | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 479\u2013508 | doi=10.1146/annurev.so.06.080180.002403}}</ref> Therefore, given these status roles, it would be expected that younger individuals (low status) conform to the majority whereas older individuals (high status) would be expected not to conform <ref name=\"Eagly1982\" />\n\nResearchers have also reported an interaction of gender and age on conformity.<ref name=\"Eagly1980\">{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = A.H. | last2 = Chrvala | first2 = C. | year = 1980 | title = Sex differences in conformity: Status and gender role interpretations | url = http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ344964&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ344964 | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 203\u2013220 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.1986.tb00747.x }}</ref> Eagly and Chrvala examined the role of age (under 19 years vs. 19 years and older), gender and surveillance (anticipating responses to be shared with group members vs. not anticipating responses being shared) on conformity to group opinions. They discovered that among participants that were 19 years or older, females conformed to group opinions more so than males when under surveillance (i.e., anticipated that their responses would be shared with group members). However, there were no gender differences in conformity among participants who were under 19 years of age and in surveillance conditions. There were also no gender differences when participants were not under surveillance. In a subsequent research article, Eagly suggests that women are more likely to conform than men because of lower status roles of women in society. She suggests that more submissive roles (i.e., conforming) are expected of individuals that hold low status roles.<ref name=\"Eagly1982\">{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = A.H. | last2 = Wood | first2 = W. | year = 1982 | title = Inferred sex differences in status as a determinant of gender stereotypes about social influence | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 915\u2013928 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.915}}</ref>  Still, Eagly and Chrvala's results do conflict with previous research which have found higher conformity levels among younger rather than older individuals.\n\n=== Size of the group ===\nAlthough conformity pressures generally increase as the size of the majority increases, a meta-analysis suggests that conformity pressures in Asch's experiment peak once the majority reaches about four or five in number.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bond | first1 = R. | last2 = Smith | first2 = P.

A participant may not feel much pressure to conform when the first person gives an incorrect response. However, conformity pressure will increase as each additional group member also gives the same incorrect response.<ref name = Campbell1989 />\n\n=== Different stimuli ===\nIn 1961 Stanley Milgram published a study in which he utilized Asch's conformity paradigm using audio tones instead of lines; he conducted his study in Norway and France.<ref name=\"Milgram\" /> He found substantially higher levels of conformity than Asch, with participants conforming 50% of the time in France and 62% of the time in Norway during critical trials. Milgram also conducted the same experiment once more, but told participants that the results of the study would be applied to the design of aircraft safety signals. His conformity estimates were 56% in Norway and 46% in France, suggesting that individuals conformed slightly less when the task was linked to an important issue. Stanley Milgram's study demonstrated that Asch's study could be replicated with other stimuli, and that in the case of tones, there was a high degree of conformity.\n\n=== Neural correlates ===\nEvidence has been found for the involvement of the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) in conformity,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Izuma | first1 = K | year = 2013 | title = The neural basis of social influence and attitude change | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 456\u2013462 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2013.03.009 | pmid = 23608704 }}</ref> an area associated with memory and decision-making.

An inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods, although it failed to prosper: the stock was old and worn out, and the location was poor. Joseph Wells managed to earn a meagre income, but little of it came from the shop and he received an unsteady amount of money from playing [[Amateur and professional cricketers|professional cricket]] for the [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent county team]].<ref name=\"Smith\">Smith, David C.

He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's Commercial Academy, a [[private school]] founded in 1849, following the bankruptcy of Morley's earlier school. The teaching was erratic, the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing [[Copperplate script|copperplate handwriting]] and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley's Academy until 1880. In 1877, his father, Joseph Wells, suffered a fractured thigh. The accident effectively put an end to Joseph's career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Sep. 21, 1866: Wells Springs Forth|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/09/0921hg-wells-birthday/|magazine=Wired|date=9 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Uppark-Sfront-01.jpg|thumb|left|Wells spent the winter of 1887-88 convalescing at [[Uppark]], where his mother, Sarah, was housekeeper.<ref name=Pevsner>{{cite book |last=Nairn |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Nairn |author2=Pevsner, Nikolaus |authorlink2=Nikolaus Pevsner  |title=The Buildings of England: Sussex |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=Harmondsworth |year=1965 |isbn=0-14-071028-0 |pages=358\u201360|title-link=The Buildings of England }}</ref>]]\nNo longer able to support themselves financially, the family instead sought to place their sons as [[apprenticeship|apprentice]]s in various occupations.<ref>{{cite news|title=HG Wells: prophet of free love|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/11/hg-wells-david-lodge|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 October 2017}}</ref> From 1880 to 1883, Wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a [[draper]] at the [[Southsea]] Drapery Emporium, Hyde's.<ref name=\"GHW1925\" /> His experiences at Hyde's, where he worked a thirteen-hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices,<ref name=\"Francis\"/> later inspired his novels ''[[The Wheels of Chance]]'', ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]'', and ''[[Kipps]]'', which portray the life of a draper's apprentice as well as providing a critique of society's distribution of wealth.<ref>{{cite book |last=Batchelor |first=John |title=H.

Thereafter, she and Joseph lived separate lives, though they never divorced and remained faithful to each other. As a consequence, Herbert's personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also, later, as a chemist's assistant.

After a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby [[Midhurst]] and an even shorter stay as a boarder at [[Midhurst Grammar School]], he signed his apprenticeship papers at Hyde's.

Cambridge University Press. Retrieved 17 June 2016</ref>\n\nAccording to [[James E. Gunn (writer)|James Gunn]], one of Wells's major contributions to the science fiction genre was his approach, which he referred to as his \"new system of ideas\".<ref>[http://www.sfcenter.ku.edu/tomorrow.htm The Man Who Invented Tomorrow] In 1902, when [[Arnold Bennett]] was writing a long article for ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' about Wells as a serious writer, Wells expressed his hope that Bennett would stress his \"new system of ideas\". Wells developed a theory to justify the way he wrote (he was fond of theories), and these theories helped others write in similar ways.</ref> In his opinion, the author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen, today referred to as \"the plausible impossible\" and \"[[suspension of disbelief]]\". While neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. He conceived the idea of using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.<ref name=\"McFarland\"/> He explained that while writing ''The Time Machine'', he realised that \"the more impossible the story I had to tell, the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now set the [[Time travel|Time Traveller]] were all that I could imagine of solid upper-class comforts.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writework.com/book-guides/the-time-machine-h-g-wells/scientists-and-gentlemen|title=The Time Machine \u2013 Scientists and Gentlemen \u2013 WriteWork|website=www.writework.com}}</ref> In \"Wells's Law\", a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Being aware the notion of magic as something real had disappeared from society, he, therefore, used scientific ideas and theories as a substitute for magic to justify the impossible.

Wells {{Circa}} 1918|right]]\nFrom quite early in Wells's career, he sought a better way to organise society and wrote a number of [[Utopia]]n novels. The first of these was ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'' (1905), which shows a worldwide utopia with \"no imports but meteorites, and no exports at all\";<ref>''A Modern Utopia''</ref> two travellers from our world fall into its [[alternate history]]. The others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe, until people realise a better way of living: whether by mysterious gases from a [[comet]] causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a European war (''[[In the Days of the Comet]]'' (1906)), or a world council of scientists taking over, as in ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933, which he later adapted for the 1936 [[Alexander Korda]] film, ''[[Things to Come]]''). This depicted, all too accurately, the impending [[World War II|World War]], with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs. He also portrayed the rise of [[fascism|fascist]] dictators in ''The Autocracy of Mr Parham'' (1930) and ''The Holy Terror'' (1939). ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923) is also a utopian novel. Wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure; the critic [[Malcolm Cowley]] stated: \"by the time he was forty, his influence was wider than any other living English writer\".<ref>Cowley, Malcolm. \"Outline of Wells's History\". ''[[The New Republic]]'' Vol. 81 Issue 1041, 14 November 1934 (pp. 22\u201323).</ref>\n\nWells contemplates the ideas of [[nature and nurture]] and questions humanity in books such as ''The Island of Doctor Moreau''. Not all his scientific romances ended in a Utopia, and Wells also wrote a [[dystopia]]n novel, ''When the Sleeper Wakes'' (1899, rewritten as ''The Sleeper Awakes'', 1910), which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated, leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers.<ref>William Steinhoff, \"Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''\" 153, in Eric S.

The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England; like [[Gulliver's Travels|Gulliver]] on his return from the [[Houyhnhnm]]s, he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts, slowly reverting to their animal natures.<ref name=\"Moreau\">Wells, H.

Wells Society, 1981</ref>\n\n==Religious views==\nWells wrote in his book ''[[God the Invisible King]]'' (1917) that his idea of God did not draw upon the traditional religions of the world: <blockquote>This book sets out as forcibly and exactly as possible the religious belief of the writer. [Which] is a profound belief in a personal and intimate God.&nbsp;... Putting the leading idea of this book very roughly, these two antagonistic typical conceptions of God may be best contrasted by speaking of one of them as God-as-Nature or the Creator, and of the other as God-as-Christ or the Redeemer. One is the great Outward God; the other is the Inmost God. The first idea was perhaps developed most highly and completely in the God of Spinoza. It is a conception of God tending to pantheism, to an idea of a comprehensive God as ruling with justice rather than affection, to a conception of aloofness and awestriking worshipfulness. The second idea, which is contradictory to this idea of an absolute God, is the God of the human heart. The writer suggested that the great outline of the theological struggles of that phase of civilisation and world unity which produced Christianity, was a persistent but unsuccessful attempt to get these two different ideas of God into one focus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wells|first=H. G. |title=God the Invisible King|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.37681|publisher=Cassell|location=London|year=1917|chapter=Preface|oclc=261326125|isbn=0-585-00604-0}} [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1046/1046-h/1046-h.htm Link to the online book.].</ref></blockquote> Later in the work, he aligns himself with a \"renascent or modern religion&nbsp;... neither atheist nor Buddhist nor Mohammedan nor Christian&nbsp;... [that] he has found growing up in himself\".<ref>Wells (1917: \"The cosmology of modern religion\").</ref>\n\nOf [[Christianity]], he said: \"it is not now true for me.&nbsp;... Every believing Christian is, I am sure, my spiritual brother&nbsp;... but if systemically I called myself a Christian I feel that to most men I should imply too much and so tell a lie\". Of other world religions, he writes: \"All these religions are true for me as [[Canterbury Cathedral]] is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for me to live in them.&nbsp;... They do not work for me\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Wells|first=H.

He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's Commercial Academy, a [[private school]] founded in 1849, following the bankruptcy of Morley's earlier school. The teaching was erratic, the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing [[Copperplate script|copperplate handwriting]] and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley's Academy until 1880. In 1877, his father, Joseph Wells, suffered a fractured thigh. The accident effectively put an end to Joseph's career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Sep. 21, 1866: Wells Springs Forth|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/09/0921hg-wells-birthday/|magazine=Wired|date=9 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Uppark-Sfront-01.jpg|thumb|left|Wells spent the winter of 1887-88 convalescing at [[Uppark]], where his mother, Sarah, was housekeeper.<ref name=Pevsner>{{cite book |last=Nairn |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Nairn |author2=Pevsner, Nikolaus |authorlink2=Nikolaus Pevsner  |title=The Buildings of England: Sussex |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=Harmondsworth |year=1965 |isbn=0-14-071028-0 |pages=358\u201360|title-link=The Buildings of England }}</ref>]]\nNo longer able to support themselves financially, the family instead sought to place their sons as [[apprenticeship|apprentice]]s in various occupations.<ref>{{cite news|title=HG Wells: prophet of free love|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/11/hg-wells-david-lodge|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 October 2017}}</ref> From 1880 to 1883, Wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a [[draper]] at the [[Southsea]] Drapery Emporium, Hyde's.<ref name=\"GHW1925\" /> His experiences at Hyde's, where he worked a thirteen-hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices,<ref name=\"Francis\"/> later inspired his novels ''[[The Wheels of Chance]]'', ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]'', and ''[[Kipps]]'', which portray the life of a draper's apprentice as well as providing a critique of society's distribution of wealth.<ref>{{cite book |last=Batchelor |first=John |title=H.

Thereafter, she and Joseph lived separate lives, though they never divorced and remained faithful to each other. As a consequence, Herbert's personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also, later, as a chemist's assistant.

After a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby [[Midhurst]] and an even shorter stay as a boarder at [[Midhurst Grammar School]], he signed his apprenticeship papers at Hyde's.

Wells developed a theory to justify the way he wrote (he was fond of theories), and these theories helped others write in similar ways.</ref> In his opinion, the author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen, today referred to as \"the plausible impossible\" and \"[[suspension of disbelief]]\". While neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. He conceived the idea of using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.<ref name=\"McFarland\"/> He explained that while writing ''The Time Machine'', he realised that \"the more impossible the story I had to tell, the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now set the [[Time travel|Time Traveller]] were all that I could imagine of solid upper-class comforts.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writework.com/book-guides/the-time-machine-h-g-wells/scientists-and-gentlemen|title=The Time Machine \u2013 Scientists and Gentlemen \u2013 WriteWork|website=www.writework.com}}</ref> In \"Wells's Law\", a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Being aware the notion of magic as something real had disappeared from society, he, therefore, used scientific ideas and theories as a substitute for magic to justify the impossible. Wells's best-known statement of the \"law\" appears in his introduction to ''The Scientific Romances of H. G. Wells'' (1933),\n\n<blockquote>As soon as the magic trick has been done the whole business of the fantasy writer is to keep everything else human and real. Touches of prosaic detail are imperative and a rigorous adherence to the hypothesis. Any extra fantasy outside the cardinal assumption immediately gives a touch of irresponsible silliness to the invention.<ref>{{cite book|last1=D.

Wells {{Circa}} 1918|right]]\nFrom quite early in Wells's career, he sought a better way to organise society and wrote a number of [[Utopia]]n novels. The first of these was ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'' (1905), which shows a worldwide utopia with \"no imports but meteorites, and no exports at all\";<ref>''A Modern Utopia''</ref> two travellers from our world fall into its [[alternate history]]. The others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe, until people realise a better way of living: whether by mysterious gases from a [[comet]] causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a European war (''[[In the Days of the Comet]]'' (1906)), or a world council of scientists taking over, as in ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933, which he later adapted for the 1936 [[Alexander Korda]] film, ''[[Things to Come]]''). This depicted, all too accurately, the impending [[World War II|World War]], with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs. He also portrayed the rise of [[fascism|fascist]] dictators in ''The Autocracy of Mr Parham'' (1930) and ''The Holy Terror'' (1939). ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923) is also a utopian novel. Wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure; the critic [[Malcolm Cowley]] stated: \"by the time he was forty, his influence was wider than any other living English writer\".<ref>Cowley, Malcolm. \"Outline of Wells's History\". ''[[The New Republic]]'' Vol. 81 Issue 1041, 14 November 1934 (pp. 22\u201323).</ref>\n\nWells contemplates the ideas of [[nature and nurture]] and questions humanity in books such as ''The Island of Doctor Moreau''. Not all his scientific romances ended in a Utopia, and Wells also wrote a [[dystopia]]n novel, ''When the Sleeper Wakes'' (1899, rewritten as ''The Sleeper Awakes'', 1910), which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated, leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers.<ref>William Steinhoff, \"Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''\" 153, in Eric S.

The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England; like [[Gulliver's Travels|Gulliver]] on his return from the [[Houyhnhnm]]s, he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts, slowly reverting to their animal natures.<ref name=\"Moreau\">Wells, H.

[Which] is a profound belief in a personal and intimate God.&nbsp;... Putting the leading idea of this book very roughly, these two antagonistic typical conceptions of God may be best contrasted by speaking of one of them as God-as-Nature or the Creator, and of the other as God-as-Christ or the Redeemer. One is the great Outward God; the other is the Inmost God. The first idea was perhaps developed most highly and completely in the God of Spinoza. It is a conception of God tending to pantheism, to an idea of a comprehensive God as ruling with justice rather than affection, to a conception of aloofness and awestriking worshipfulness. The second idea, which is contradictory to this idea of an absolute God, is the God of the human heart. The writer suggested that the great outline of the theological struggles of that phase of civilisation and world unity which produced Christianity, was a persistent but unsuccessful attempt to get these two different ideas of God into one focus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wells|first=H.

[that] he has found growing up in himself\".<ref>Wells (1917: \"The cosmology of modern religion\").</ref>\n\nOf [[Christianity]], he said: \"it is not now true for me.&nbsp;... Every believing Christian is, I am sure, my spiritual brother&nbsp;... but if systemically I called myself a Christian I feel that to most men I should imply too much and so tell a lie\". Of other world religions, he writes: \"All these religions are true for me as [[Canterbury Cathedral]] is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for me to live in them.&nbsp;... They do not work for me\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Wells|first=H.

Siddharth ([[Shiney Ahuja]]) and Avni ([[Vidya Balan]]), the son and daughter-in-law of Badri's elder brother, return to their native village from the [[United States]] and decide to stay in their ancestral palace. This leads to Siddharth's childhood love interest Radha ([[Ameesha Patel]]), who is Badri's adopted daughter, becoming jealous but she immediately recovers. Siddharth is crowned as the king, his right to the throne.\n\nThe palace where Siddharth and Avni were staying was once occupied by [[Raja]] Vibhuti Narayan, who was Siddharth's ancestor. He had fallen in love with Manjulika, a dancer hailing from [[Bengal]]. But Manjulika was in love with Shashidhar, another dancer, who resided in a house just behind the palace and often met her secretly. On the night of Durgashtami, when the king gets to know of the affair and their plan to elope, he calls them to perform a dance one last time in the court. In the end, the king beheads Shashidhar and imprisons Manjulika in her room. Then on the day of the king's marriage, Manjulika hangs herself and swore that her spirit would not leave any king who lived in that very palace. Various omens started taking place after that, presuming that the \"[[evil eye]]\" may have befallen on the king. The king too dies under unknown circumstances. Soon, with the aid of powerful sorcerers, both Shashidhar's and Manjulika's spirits were locked up in a room in the third floor of the palace using a sacred talisman.\n\nEvents take a twist when Avni obtains a copy of the third floor room key and opens the forbidden locked room that contains the ghost of Manjulika. Unnatural events start taking place inside the palace. Avni falls in love with the place and learns about Manjulika and her tragic story. She becomes enamored with Manjulika. Badri and Batuk Shankar ([[Paresh Rawal]]) try to ward off the evil eye with the help of a priest, Shri Yagyaprakashji Bharti ([[Vikram Gokhale]]), but unfortunately the priest has gone to [[London]] and is unsure when he might return.\n\nSiddharth starts suspecting Radha for all the strange occurrences. He thinks she has gone crazy since he was supposed to marry her, but married Avni instead. He calls his friend, psychiatrist Dr. Aditya Shrivastav ([[Akshay Kumar]]) from [[New York City|New York]], to try to figure out what the problem is with Radha. Once Aditya reaches the palace, things become comical, as everyone thinks he is a fool, though he is very intelligent. Aditya falls in love with Radha. One night, he encounters Manjulika and dares her to strike. The ghost angrily vows to take her revenge on the auspicious day of [[Durga puja|Durgashtami]].\n\nDuring the engagement of Siddharth's cousin Nandini, and Sharad Prahlad ([[Vineeth]]), Avni spills tea\non Sharad and takes him away to get him cleaned. When Aditya and Siddharth search for her, they see that there is a struggle between Avni and Sharad, and quickly intervene. Siddharth thinks that Sharad was violating Avni, but Aditya tells him that Avni is the real culprit, not Radha as previously suspected. It is revealed that Avni has [[dissociative identity disorder]], a disease that affects the person's identity, making them think they are someone else. Aditya explains that Avni is the one making all the strange things happen around the palace. He reveals that he visited Avni's hometown to gather information about her childhood and has factual evidence. He then tells the half-convinced Siddharth to provoke Avni in order to make him realize that something is wrong. When Siddharth provokes her, Avni shows the dark personality of Manjulika before returning to her usual self, much to the horror and concern of Siddharth, who asks Aditya to save Avni.\n\nDuring ''Durgashtami'', Aditya and Siddharth see Avni assume Manjulika's identity, dressed as her and dancing to the tunes Manjulika had been dancing to with her love, Shashidhar, before the king murdered him. The tragic love story of the old king Vibhuti Narayan, who loved Manjulika, who in turn loved Shashidhar, is revealed. Avni imagines herself as Manjulika and Sharad as Shashidhar, dancing in the court of the king. Avni completely assumes the identity of Manjulika and tries to kill her own husband Siddharth; she sees him as the king who had killed Manjulika's lover.\n\nTo cure Avni, Aditya triggers Manjulika's personality and makes her promise to leave Avni if she gets the opportunity to kill the king and take her revenge. The priest Shri Yagyaprakashji Bharti arrives and with his help, during the ritual of ''Durgashtami'', Aditya lays out an intricate plan to trick Manjulika into thinking she is killing the king when she is actually slaying a dummy. After the \"murder\", Manjulika, now [[Demon|content]], leaves Avni forever. Avni is healed and everything ends well. Aditya tells Radha, whom he has taken a liking to, that he will send his parents over if she is interested in marrying him, to which a happy Radha gives her silent consent.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The film received universal critical acclaim and was also a huge commercial success. Subsequently the film also attained cult status in Hindi cinema.

Siddharth ([[Shiney Ahuja]]) and Avni ([[Vidya Balan]]), the son and daughter-in-law of Badri's elder brother, return to their native village from the [[United States]] and decide to stay in their ancestral palace. This leads to Siddharth's childhood love interest Radha ([[Ameesha Patel]]), who is Badri's adopted daughter, becoming jealous but she immediately recovers. Siddharth is crowned as the king, his right to the throne.\n\nThe palace where Siddharth and Avni were staying was once occupied by [[Raja]] Vibhuti Narayan, who was Siddharth's ancestor. He had fallen in love with Manjulika, a dancer hailing from [[Bengal]]. But Manjulika was in love with Shashidhar, another dancer, who resided in a house just behind the palace and often met her secretly. On the night of Durgashtami, when the king gets to know of the affair and their plan to elope, he calls them to perform a dance one last time in the court. In the end, the king beheads Shashidhar and imprisons Manjulika in her room. Then on the day of the king's marriage, Manjulika hangs herself and swore that her spirit would not leave any king who lived in that very palace. Various omens started taking place after that, presuming that the \"[[evil eye]]\" may have befallen on the king. The king too dies under unknown circumstances. Soon, with the aid of powerful sorcerers, both Shashidhar's and Manjulika's spirits were locked up in a room in the third floor of the palace using a sacred talisman.\n\nEvents take a twist when Avni obtains a copy of the third floor room key and opens the forbidden locked room that contains the ghost of Manjulika. Unnatural events start taking place inside the palace. Avni falls in love with the place and learns about Manjulika and her tragic story. She becomes enamored with Manjulika. Badri and Batuk Shankar ([[Paresh Rawal]]) try to ward off the evil eye with the help of a priest, Shri Yagyaprakashji Bharti ([[Vikram Gokhale]]), but unfortunately the priest has gone to [[London]] and is unsure when he might return.\n\nSiddharth starts suspecting Radha for all the strange occurrences. He thinks she has gone crazy since he was supposed to marry her, but married Avni instead. He calls his friend, psychiatrist Dr. Aditya Shrivastav ([[Akshay Kumar]]) from [[New York City|New York]], to try to figure out what the problem is with Radha. Once Aditya reaches the palace, things become comical, as everyone thinks he is a fool, though he is very intelligent. Aditya falls in love with Radha. One night, he encounters Manjulika and dares her to strike. The ghost angrily vows to take her revenge on the auspicious day of [[Durga puja|Durgashtami]].\n\nDuring the engagement of Siddharth's cousin Nandini, and Sharad Prahlad ([[Vineeth]]), Avni spills tea\non Sharad and takes him away to get him cleaned. When Aditya and Siddharth search for her, they see that there is a struggle between Avni and Sharad, and quickly intervene. Siddharth thinks that Sharad was violating Avni, but Aditya tells him that Avni is the real culprit, not Radha as previously suspected. It is revealed that Avni has [[dissociative identity disorder]], a disease that affects the person's identity, making them think they are someone else. Aditya explains that Avni is the one making all the strange things happen around the palace. He reveals that he visited Avni's hometown to gather information about her childhood and has factual evidence. He then tells the half-convinced Siddharth to provoke Avni in order to make him realize that something is wrong. When Siddharth provokes her, Avni shows the dark personality of Manjulika before returning to her usual self, much to the horror and concern of Siddharth, who asks Aditya to save Avni.\n\nDuring ''Durgashtami'', Aditya and Siddharth see Avni assume Manjulika's identity, dressed as her and dancing to the tunes Manjulika had been dancing to with her love, Shashidhar, before the king murdered him. The tragic love story of the old king Vibhuti Narayan, who loved Manjulika, who in turn loved Shashidhar, is revealed. Avni imagines herself as Manjulika and Sharad as Shashidhar, dancing in the court of the king. Avni completely assumes the identity of Manjulika and tries to kill her own husband Siddharth; she sees him as the king who had killed Manjulika's lover.\n\nTo cure Avni, Aditya triggers Manjulika's personality and makes her promise to leave Avni if she gets the opportunity to kill the king and take her revenge. The priest Shri Yagyaprakashji Bharti arrives and with his help, during the ritual of ''Durgashtami'', Aditya lays out an intricate plan to trick Manjulika into thinking she is killing the king when she is actually slaying a dummy. After the \"murder\", Manjulika, now [[Demon|content]], leaves Avni forever. Avni is healed and everything ends well. Aditya tells Radha, whom he has taken a liking to, that he will send his parents over if she is interested in marrying him, to which a happy Radha gives her silent consent.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The franchise has grossed overall over $446 million against a combined production budget of $35.5 million.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe films and the television series, which were created and developed by [[James DeMonaco]], are presenting a near-future [[Dystopia|dystopian]] [[America]] which celebrates an annual national holiday known as the Purge, in which all crimes, including murder, are legal for a 12-hour period, while others are fighting for their lives. The Purge was enacted by a new political party, the New Founding Fathers of America, or NFFA for short, as an act desperation after an economic collapse and recession, however, in the installment [[The First Purge]], it\u2019s revealed that the NFFA\u2019s intent with the holiday, is to kill off the poor in an attempt to minimize the amount of people on government assistance. The First Purge, depicts a trial run of the Purge in [[New York City]] and is first in the timeline of events in the series, despite being the most recent film released. The first Purge film, [[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]] takes places after The Purge has gone nation-wide. The next Purge film in the timeline, and the second to be released, was [[The Purge: Anarchy]] which depicts the purge being turned into an opportunity for para-military groups to go into poor parts of cities to kill the residents who cannot afford to protect themselves. The third installment, and final installment in regards the Purge timeline, is [[The Purge: Election Year]]. In Election Year, a presidential candidate, who is a senator during the beginning of the film, is running on the platform of ending the annual purge with an executive order after losing her entire family as a teenager on purge night. The Purge featured in Election Year, was the first one were politicians were not immune, which was an attempt by the NFFA to have her killed in the hopes it would keep the annual purge going. The [[The Purge (TV series)|TV series]], never reveals where it fits in the timeline of the films and was a complete [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] not in line with any of the films.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Producer(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2013|6|7}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[James DeMonaco]]\n| rowspan=\"5\" | James DeMonaco\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[Jason Blum]], [[Michael Bay]], [[Andrew Form]], [[Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller]] and Sebastien Lemercier\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2014|7|18}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2016|7|1}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The First Purge]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2018|7|4}}\n| Gerard McMurray\n| Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Brad Fuller, Sebastien Lemercier and James DeMonaco\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''Untitled Purge Sequel''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2020|7|10}}*\n|Everardo Gout<ref name=\"Everardo Gout\" />\n| Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller and Sebastien Lemercier\n|}\n\n{{small|*Expected release date.

The family of four lives in an affluent [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood and, along with their neighbors, show their patriotism and support for the national holiday by displaying blue flowers on their front stoops. The Sandins bunker down into their home to wait out the ensuing violence of the next twelve hours caused by revelers \"purging\" their unproductive emotions of hate, jealousy, and rage in a flurry of state-sanctioned mayhem, destruction, and murder. Citizens rationalize the suffering, which critics call socio-economically unbalanced, by citing the country's unprecedented peace, prosperity, and wealth. \n\nThe Sandin home, protected by an ostensibly high-quality security system sold far and wide by the family's father and head of household, becomes the target of a masked group of young holiday \"Purgers\" whose economically disadvantaged and severely wounded victim, referred to as homeless by the leader, escapes and is given refuge by the youngest child of the Sandin family. Frustrated by the interruption of their ritual sacrifice, the sadistic gang leader unmasks himself and threatens the entire family with murder if they don't surrender the man within the hour, or whenever reinforcements arrive with the equipment they need to bust through the barricades. After initially trying to capture the man and leave him to suffer his fate with the purgers, the family decides to help the man whose pain is no longer remote and can't be ignored, thus opening themselves up to accusations of unpatriotism. The purgers manage to break in and brutal fighting ensues with casualties on both sides. Losing their advantage, the family is about to be killed until they are \"saved\" by their neighbors, who blast away the remaining purgers to then announce that the Sandins' lives are their neighbors' to take. Facing execution by former friends, the stranger, who managed to escape most of the fighting, helps the Sandins by disarming the jealous neighbors. Faced with the choice of killing their neighbors, which in this world would be well within their rights, the family decides to hold them hostage until Purge night is over, further highlighting their unwilllingnessless to participate in the killing holiday.\n\nDespite mixed reviews, the film grossed $89.3 million during its run, far surpassing its $3 million budget. The film was turned into a [[Halloween Horror Nights#Scare zones|scare zone]] in 2014 for [[Universal Parks & Resorts]] annual [[Halloween Horror Nights]] due to its success.\n\n===''The Purge: Anarchy'' (2014)===\n{{main|The Purge: Anarchy}}\n'''''The Purge: Anarchy''''', released worldwide on July 18, 2014,<ref name=\"Release\">{{cite news |title=Universal Re-Slots ''The Purge: Anarchy'' |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/02/universal-re-slots-the-purge-anarchy |accessdate=1 March 2014 |newspaper=Deadline.com |date=28 February 2014}}</ref> stars [[Frank Grillo]], [[Carmen Ejogo]], [[Zach Gilford]], [[Kiele Sanchez]], [[Zo\u00eb Soul]] and [[Michael K.

After a betrayal within the government targets her for death minutes after the Purge's commencement, Barnes must protect Roan while on the run for safety until they meet and form an alliance with some of her supporters; two shopkeepers, an EMT, and an anti-Purge rebel team headed by the wounded Stranger from the first two films, whose real name is Dante Bishop. Meanwhile, NFFA candidate and Roan's rival, Minister Edwidge Owens, leads the NFFA in committing more acts of violence during Purge night as rebels try to protect more citizens.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and went on to gross over $118 million worldwide against a budget of $10 million, becoming the second highest-grossing film of the series.\n\n===''The First Purge'' (2018)===\n{{main|The First Purge}}\nIn September 2016, James DeMonaco, who wrote and directed every film in the series thus far, stated that the fourth film would be a prequel to the trilogy.

The organization establishes a new [[totalitarian government]] and a [[police state]]. In 2016, the NFFA devises a plan to help stabilize American society and later in 2017, the 28th Amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S Constitution]] is ratified. This amendment establishes a 12-hour event known as \"The Purge\" which would take place from 7:00 in the evening of March 21, 2017 to 7:00 in the morning of March 22, 2017 wherein all crime including murder becomes legal. Before the Purge begins, the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] is activated with rules and a prayer saying \"Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn\" before ending with \"May God be with you all\".\n\nThe rules for the annual Purge are as follows:\n* Sirens blare throughout the land to signal the start and end of The Purge.\n* All police, fire, and medical emergency services remain unavailable or suspended for the twelve-hour Purge.\n* Government officials of ranking 10 or higher are granted immunity (revoked in ''Election Year'' to legalize the murder of a political opponent).\n* \"Class 1-4\" weaponry are permitted\n\nBelow is how the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] announces the Purge' commencement in the first two films:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Government officials of ranking 10 have been granted immunity from the Purge and shall not be harmed.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Police, fire, and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m., when The Purge concludes.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]'' (taking place 20 years after the establishment of The Purge), the rule granting immunity to ranking 10 officials is revoked by the NFFA in order to assassinate Roan, an anti-Purge Presidential candidate who runs on a platform of overturning the 28th Amendment which, to the NFFA's distress, has achieved parity in the polls with their candidate. This change is reflected in the announcement of the final Purge's commencement as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge, sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Police, fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 am.''\n'''''And, for the first time since its inception, no one has been granted special immunity from the Purge. No citizen or group will be exempt.'''''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''[[The First Purge]]'', taking place in 2017 on [[Staten Island]], [[New York City|New York]], which was blocked off from all contact due to the First Purge really being a social experiment conducted by the New Founding Fathers, providing monetary compensation of at least $5,000 to anyone who decides to stay on the island for the night, one year prior to the first nationwide Purge.

Although it is thought to be used as an act of catharsis for the U.S. populace, it is actually used as a method of artificial [[Human population planning|population control]], as the unemployed poor in slum neighborhoods as well as some working-class people are usually the main targets; in ''Election Year'', a character notes that sneaking up on a black man on Purge night is a particularly foolish action, suggesting that black people are used to being targets on this night. By this time it has also increased tourism as foreigners enter the US solely to participate in the Purge.\n\nThe event is presumed to have ended 3 months later from the main events of the third film.\n\n==Characters==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; float:center; padding:5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''Key'''</center>\n* A {{note label|Young|Y}} indicates the actor portrayed the role of a younger version of the character.\n* A {{note label|Voice|V}} indicates the actor or actress lent only their voice for their character.\n* A dark gray cell indicates the character was not in the film.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:19.286%;\"| Character\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Film\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Television series\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:16.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| ''[[The First Purge]]''\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Purge (TV series)|The Purge]]''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 1 (2018)|Season 1]]\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 2 (2019)|Season 2]]\n|-\n!

The franchise has grossed overall over $446 million against a combined production budget of $35.5 million.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe films and the television series, which were created and developed by [[James DeMonaco]], are presenting a near-future [[Dystopia|dystopian]] [[America]] which celebrates an annual national holiday known as the Purge, in which all crimes, including murder, are legal for a 12-hour period, while others are fighting for their lives. The Purge was enacted by a new political party, the New Founding Fathers of America, or NFFA for short, as an act desperation after an economic collapse and recession, however, in the installment [[The First Purge]], it\u2019s revealed that the NFFA\u2019s intent with the holiday, is to kill off the poor in an attempt to minimize the amount of people on government assistance. The First Purge, depicts a trial run of the Purge in [[New York City]] and is first in the timeline of events in the series, despite being the most recent film released. The first Purge film, [[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]] takes places after The Purge has gone nation-wide. The next Purge film in the timeline, and the second to be released, was [[The Purge: Anarchy]] which depicts the purge being turned into an opportunity for para-military groups to go into poor parts of cities to kill the residents who cannot afford to protect themselves. The third installment, and final installment in regards the Purge timeline, is [[The Purge: Election Year]]. In Election Year, a presidential candidate, who is a senator during the beginning of the film, is running on the platform of ending the annual purge with an executive order after losing her entire family as a teenager on purge night. The Purge featured in Election Year, was the first one were politicians were not immune, which was an attempt by the NFFA to have her killed in the hopes it would keep the annual purge going. The [[The Purge (TV series)|TV series]], never reveals where it fits in the timeline of the films and was a complete [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] not in line with any of the films.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Producer(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2013|6|7}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[James DeMonaco]]\n| rowspan=\"5\" | James DeMonaco\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[Jason Blum]], [[Michael Bay]], [[Andrew Form]], [[Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller]] and Sebastien Lemercier\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2014|7|18}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2016|7|1}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The First Purge]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2018|7|4}}\n| Gerard McMurray\n| Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Brad Fuller, Sebastien Lemercier and James DeMonaco\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''Untitled Purge Sequel''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2020|7|10}}*\n|Everardo Gout<ref name=\"Everardo Gout\" />\n| Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Bradley Fuller|Brad Fuller and Sebastien Lemercier\n|}\n\n{{small|*Expected release date.

The family of four lives in an affluent [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood and, along with their neighbors, show their patriotism and support for the national holiday by displaying blue flowers on their front stoops. The Sandins bunker down into their home to wait out the ensuing violence of the next twelve hours caused by revelers \"purging\" their unproductive emotions of hate, jealousy, and rage in a flurry of state-sanctioned mayhem, destruction, and murder. Citizens rationalize the suffering, which critics call socio-economically unbalanced, by citing the country's unprecedented peace, prosperity, and wealth. \n\nThe Sandin home, protected by an ostensibly high-quality security system sold far and wide by the family's father and head of household, becomes the target of a masked group of young holiday \"Purgers\" whose economically disadvantaged and severely wounded victim, referred to as homeless by the leader, escapes and is given refuge by the youngest child of the Sandin family. Frustrated by the interruption of their ritual sacrifice, the sadistic gang leader unmasks himself and threatens the entire family with murder if they don't surrender the man within the hour, or whenever reinforcements arrive with the equipment they need to bust through the barricades. After initially trying to capture the man and leave him to suffer his fate with the purgers, the family decides to help the man whose pain is no longer remote and can't be ignored, thus opening themselves up to accusations of unpatriotism. The purgers manage to break in and brutal fighting ensues with casualties on both sides. Losing their advantage, the family is about to be killed until they are \"saved\" by their neighbors, who blast away the remaining purgers to then announce that the Sandins' lives are their neighbors' to take. Facing execution by former friends, the stranger, who managed to escape most of the fighting, helps the Sandins by disarming the jealous neighbors. Faced with the choice of killing their neighbors, which in this world would be well within their rights, the family decides to hold them hostage until Purge night is over, further highlighting their unwilllingnessless to participate in the killing holiday.\n\nDespite mixed reviews, the film grossed $89.3 million during its run, far surpassing its $3 million budget. The film was turned into a [[Halloween Horror Nights#Scare zones|scare zone]] in 2014 for [[Universal Parks & Resorts]] annual [[Halloween Horror Nights]] due to its success.\n\n===''The Purge: Anarchy'' (2014)===\n{{main|The Purge: Anarchy}}\n'''''The Purge: Anarchy''''', released worldwide on July 18, 2014,<ref name=\"Release\">{{cite news |title=Universal Re-Slots ''The Purge: Anarchy'' |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/02/universal-re-slots-the-purge-anarchy |accessdate=1 March 2014 |newspaper=Deadline.com |date=28 February 2014}}</ref> stars [[Frank Grillo]], [[Carmen Ejogo]], [[Zach Gilford]], [[Kiele Sanchez]], [[Zo\u00eb Soul]] and [[Michael K.

In a bid to prevent this from happening, The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) takes the unprecedented step of abolishing the protection afforded to government officials of ranking 10, allowing the U.S. public to target all government officials for the first time since the purge's creation. After a betrayal within the government targets her for death minutes after the Purge's commencement, Barnes must protect Roan while on the run for safety until they meet and form an alliance with some of her supporters; two shopkeepers, an EMT, and an anti-Purge rebel team headed by the wounded Stranger from the first two films, whose real name is Dante Bishop. Meanwhile, NFFA candidate and Roan's rival, Minister Edwidge Owens, leads the NFFA in committing more acts of violence during Purge night as rebels try to protect more citizens.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and went on to gross over $118 million worldwide against a budget of $10 million, becoming the second highest-grossing film of the series.\n\n===''The First Purge'' (2018)===\n{{main|The First Purge}}\nIn September 2016, James DeMonaco, who wrote and directed every film in the series thus far, stated that the fourth film would be a prequel to the trilogy.

The Purge starts its trial run in the year 2017, confined only on [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. While only small crimes take place during the event, a corrupt official in the NFFA tampers with the experiment by adding mercenaries to increase casualties and to gain more favor. \n\nIn February 2017, DeMonaco announced that a fourth installment was in development.

The organization establishes a new [[totalitarian government]] and a [[police state]]. In 2016, the NFFA devises a plan to help stabilize American society and later in 2017, the 28th Amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S Constitution]] is ratified. This amendment establishes a 12-hour event known as \"The Purge\" which would take place from 7:00 in the evening of March 21, 2017 to 7:00 in the morning of March 22, 2017 wherein all crime including murder becomes legal. Before the Purge begins, the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] is activated with rules and a prayer saying \"Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn\" before ending with \"May God be with you all\".\n\nThe rules for the annual Purge are as follows:\n* Sirens blare throughout the land to signal the start and end of The Purge.\n* All police, fire, and medical emergency services remain unavailable or suspended for the twelve-hour Purge.\n* Government officials of ranking 10 or higher are granted immunity (revoked in ''Election Year'' to legalize the murder of a political opponent).\n* \"Class 1-4\" weaponry are permitted\n\nBelow is how the [[Emergency Broadcast System]] announces the Purge' commencement in the first two films:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Government officials of ranking 10 have been granted immunity from the Purge and shall not be harmed.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Police, fire, and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m., when The Purge concludes.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]'' (taking place 20 years after the establishment of The Purge), the rule granting immunity to ranking 10 officials is revoked by the NFFA in order to assassinate Roan, an anti-Purge Presidential candidate who runs on a platform of overturning the 28th Amendment which, to the NFFA's distress, has achieved parity in the polls with their candidate. This change is reflected in the announcement of the final Purge's commencement as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge, sanctioned by the U.S. Government.''\n''Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted.''\n''Police, fire and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 am.''\n'''''And, for the first time since its inception, no one has been granted special immunity from the Purge. No citizen or group will be exempt.'''''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nIn ''[[The First Purge]]'', taking place in 2017 on [[Staten Island]], [[New York City|New York]], which was blocked off from all contact due to the First Purge really being a social experiment conducted by the New Founding Fathers, providing monetary compensation of at least $5,000 to anyone who decides to stay on the island for the night, one year prior to the first nationwide Purge. Below shows the commencement speech as follows:\n\n{{cquote|''This is not a test.''\n'''''This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the NFFA Social Experiment on Staten Island, New York.'''''\n''Weapons of class 4 and lower have been authorized for use during the experiment.''\n''Any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.''\n''Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn.''\n''May God be with you all.''|author=Staten Island Purge Emergency Broadcast System}}\n\nWithin the film series, the Purge has resulted in crime and unemployment rates plummeting to 1% and a strong economy. Although it is thought to be used as an act of catharsis for the U.S. populace, it is actually used as a method of artificial [[Human population planning|population control]], as the unemployed poor in slum neighborhoods as well as some working-class people are usually the main targets; in ''Election Year'', a character notes that sneaking up on a black man on Purge night is a particularly foolish action, suggesting that black people are used to being targets on this night. By this time it has also increased tourism as foreigners enter the US solely to participate in the Purge.\n\nThe event was ended 3 months later from the main events of the third film.\n\n==Characters==\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; float:center; padding:5px; display:table;\">\n<center>'''Key'''</center>\n* A {{note label|Young|Y}} indicates the actor portrayed the role of a younger version of the character.\n* A {{note label|Voice|V}} indicates the actor or actress lent only their voice for their character.\n* A dark gray cell indicates the character was not in the film.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:19.286%;\"| Character\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Film\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Television series\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:14.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:16.286%;\"| ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]''\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| ''[[The First Purge]]''\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Purge (TV series)|The Purge]]''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 1 (2018)|Season 1]]\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:12.286%;\"| [[The Purge (TV series)#Season 2 (2019)|Season 2]]\n|-\n!
