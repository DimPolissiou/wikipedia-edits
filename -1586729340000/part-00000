It had made 438 flights (836 hours), of which 196 flights were supersonic.\n\n==Pre-production aircraft==\n\nBoth pre-production aircraft were used to further develop the design of the aircraft. Changes to design include different wing plan form, more fuel, different engine standard and different air intake systems.\n[[File:Concorde_101.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Concorde G-AXDN (101) in the AirSpace exhibition hall at [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]].]]\n*Concorde G-AXDN (101) first flew on 17 December 1971 from Filton and was retired to the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]], England, where it landed on 20 August 1977, having made 269 flights (632 hours), of which 168 flights were supersonic.\n*Concorde F-WTSA (102) first flew on 10 January 1973 from Toulouse. It was the fourth aircraft and the first to have the features and the shape of the future production aircraft. It was the first to fly to the United States (on 20 September 1973 to Dallas, Texas). For several years the aircraft was painted in British Airways colours on one side and Air France colours on the other. It made 314 flights (656 hours), of which 189 were supersonic, and was then retired to [[Orly Airport]] in Paris on 20 May 1976, where it is on display to the public.\n\n==Development aircraft==\n\nThe production aircraft were different in many ways from the original aircraft, necessitating re-examining certain areas to obtain certification. In all there were six \"development\" aircraft: the two prototypes (001/002), two pre-production (101/102) and two production aircraft (201/202).\n\n*F-WTSB (201) first flew on 6 December 1973 from Toulouse. Its last flight was on 19 April 1985 from Chateauroux to Toulouse; a total of 909 flying hours. It is currently inside the Aeroscopia museum near the Airbus factory at Toulouse.\n*[[G-BBDG]] (202) first flew on 13 December 1974 from Filton to RAF Fairford. It last flew on 24 December 1981 after a total of 1282 hours. Subsequently, it was stored in a hangar on the Filton Airfield and was used as a spare parts source by BA for their Concorde fleet. It was sectioned and moved by road in May/June 2004 to the [[Brooklands Museum]] in [[Weybridge]], Surrey, where after restoration it was opened to the public in the summer of 2006.<ref>[http://www.brooklandsconcorde.com/ Brooklands]</ref>\n\n==British production aircraft==\nBritish Airways had seven production aircraft in commercial service:\n\n*'''G-BOAC''' (204) The flagship of the fleet (because of its [[BOAC]] registration) first flew on 27 February 1975 from Filton. It made its final flight to [[Manchester Airport]] \u2013 where a \"glass hangar\" was later built at the viewing park for its display \u2013 on 31 October 2003 after flying 22,260 hours.\n*'''G-BOAA''' (206) first flew on 5 November 1975 from Filton. This aircraft flew with the [[Red Arrows]] on 2 June 1996 to celebrate 50 years of [[Heathrow Airport]]. It last flew on 12 August 2000 as BA002 from New York JFK to London Heathrow after flying 22,768 hours, and did not receive modifications after the Paris crash. For its final journey it was transported to the [[National Museum of Flight]] (run by [[National Museums Scotland]]), [[East Fortune]], near Edinburgh, over land to the [[River Thames|Thames]], then by sea to [[Torness]], then over land again to the museum from 8 to 19 April 2004.\n\n[[File:Concorde g-boab heathrow.jpg|thumb|right|Concorde G-BOAB in storage at London (Heathrow) Airport, following the end of all Concorde flights]]\n\n*'''G-BOAB''' (208) first flew on 18 May 1976 from Filton. Its last flight was a positioning flight on 15 August 2000 as BA002P from New York JFK to London Heathrow after flying 22,296 hours. It remains at [[Heathrow Airport]]. It was never modified, and so never flew again after returning home following the Paris crash. G-BOAB was used by British Airways to carry out a test installation of the 'Project Rocket' interior that was later installed on the rest of the fleet, before remaining stationary for several years with its interior stripped, with boxes of magazines being used as ballast, and being periodically towed to various locations around the airport. Following minor restoration works in 2015 and 2017, the aircraft is used for apprentice training by BA.<ref>{{cite web |title=G-BOAB (208) British Production |url=https://www.heritageconcorde.com/g-boab-208 |website=Heritage Concorde |accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:235ac - British Airways Concorde; G-BOAD@LHR;15.05.2003 (8056002570).jpg|thumb|Concorde G-BOAD on 15 May 2003.]]\n\n*'''G-BOAD''' (210) first flew on 25 August 1976 from Filton.

Its engines were removed to reduce weight. Its temporary home was on a barge alongside the aircraft carrier ''Intrepid'', pending the proposed creation of a quayside display hall; however, in December 2006, this Concorde was moved to [[Floyd Bennett Field]] in Brooklyn, where it was kept in poor conditions.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/nyregion/07concorde.html?ref=nyregion | work=The New York Times | title=A Concorde Is Disfigured While Parked in Brooklyn | first=Patrick | last=McGeehan | date=7 July 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.concordesst.com/latestnews.html Concorde Sst : Latest News]</ref> G-BOAD's nose cone was knocked off by a truck at the end in June 2008.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2008/07/14/2008-07-14_retired_concorde_suffers_damage_at_floyd.html |title = Retired Concorde suffers damage at Floyd Bennett Field |first = Rachel |last = Monahan |newspaper=Daily News |date = 14 July 2008 | location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/2273991/US-leaves-Concorde-gift-from-UK-to-rot-in-airfield.html|title=US leaves Concorde gift from UK to rot in airfield|first=Laura|last=Clout|newspaper= The Telegraph|date=9 July 2008}}</ref> The damage was repaired and subsequently the aircraft was moved back to Pier 86 in Manhattan (and placed on the pier, rather than on a barge) on 20 October 2008 as part of the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum.

On 1 July 1999 it flew in formation with the [[Red Arrows]] to mark the opening of the Scottish Parliament. Its last flight was to [[Grantley Adams International Airport]] in Bridgetown ([[Barbados]]) on 17 November 2003, with 70 members of BA staff on board. The flight, lasting less than 4 hours, reached the maximum certified height of 60,000&nbsp;ft (18,300 m). It flew a total of 23,376 hours.

The aircraft flew the final Speedbird 2 service from New York on 24 October 2003, and left Heathrow for the final time on 3 November. It spent a day \"resting\" and refuelling in New York before making its final flight on 5 November from New York JFK to [[Boeing Field]], Seattle in an unusual supersonic flight (which required special permission) over the sparsely populated part of northern Canada. It is currently displayed at Seattle's [[Museum of Flight]], alongside the first [[Boeing 707|707]] that served as [[Air Force One]] and the prototype [[Boeing 747]]. This Concorde was once used as a source of spares, before being restored using parts from Air France's F-BVFD, and has flown 16,239 hours.\n*'''G-BOAF''' (216) first flew on 20 April 1979 from Filton and was the last Concorde to be built.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aerospacebristol.org/last-concorde|title= Concorde alpha foxtrot: the last concorde to be built and the last to fly|accessdate=8 February 2020|work= Aerospace Bristol}}</ref> It made Concorde's final flight on Wednesday 26 November 2003. Departing from Heathrow at 11:30 [[GMT]], it made a last, brief, supersonic flight, carrying 100 BA staff, over the Bay of Biscay.

It made its final flight to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Air and Space Museum]]'s new [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] (USA) on 12 June 2003 after flying 17,824 hours.\n*'''F-BVFB''' (207) first flew on 6 March 1976 from Toulouse. It was sold for [[Euro|\u20ac1]] to the [[Sinsheim Auto & Technik Museum]] in Germany. It flew to [[Baden Airpark|Karlsruhe-Baden\u2013Baden Airpark]], in south west Germany on 24 June 2003. After removal of its wings and tail fin, it travelled by barge and road, to join a [[Tupolev Tu-144]] already on exhibit at Sinsheim. It had flown 14,771 hours.\n*'''F-BVFC''' (209) first flew on 9 July 1976 from Toulouse. It was retired to the [[Airbus]] plant at Toulouse, where the French aircraft were constructed, on 27 June 2003, joining '''201''' and ending Air France's relationship with Concorde. The final flight was supersonic, and included a [[go around]] at Toulouse. It had flown 14,332 hours. Since January 2015, it is on display outside the Aeroscopia museum near the Toulouse factory.\n*'''F-BVFD''' (211) first flew on 10 February 1977 from Toulouse. It was retired early, in 1982, having flown only 5,814 hours (final flight on 27 May 1982). Badly corroded after being stored outdoors, and damaged through use as a source of spare parts, it was broken up in 1994. It was the only Concorde scrapped before retirement. A small section of the fuselage remains at Le Bourget, France and the nose cone was sold to an American collector.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n*'''F-BTSD''' (213) first flew on 26 June 1978 from Toulouse. It was retired to the Air and Space museum at Le Bourget (France) on 14 June 2003, joining '''001''' after flying 12,974 hours. In 1996, this aircraft carried a promotional paint scheme (blue with logo) for [[Pepsi]]. The wings were kept white, and while in the Pepsi livery, it was restricted to flying at most 20 minutes at Mach 2.02 and otherwise Mach 1.7 (the plane normally requires a white livery to fly supersonic, because of the heat);<ref name=Jolivet>{{cite web |title=Pepsi Blue Concorde 1996 |url=https://www.heritageconcorde.com/pepsi-blue-concorde-1996 |website=Heritage Concorde}}</ref> the branding estimated to have cost Pepsi $20 million{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. It flew 16 flights around the Middle East in this livery.<ref name=Jolivet/> The plane also holds the world record for flying around the world in both directions: westbound in 32 hours 49 minutes and 3 seconds on 12/13 October 1992, and eastbound in 31 hours 27 minutes and 49 seconds on 15/16 August 1995. It also was the only Concorde to land in Central America and then it set a new time record between [[Juan Santamaria International Airport]] and [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]].\n*'''F-BVFF''' (215) first flew on 26 December 1978 from Toulouse. It was undergoing D-check maintenance at the Air France maintenance hangar at Charles de Gaulle at the time of the 25 July 2000 crash which temporarily grounded all Concordes. After the withdrawal of the type was announced midway through refurbishment, it was cosmetically reassembled on the outside (outer shell only, no interior) and used as a display piece following the retirement of all Concordes. It last flew on a charter flight to Paris Charles de Gaulle on 11 June 2000 after flying 12,421 hours.\n\n==List of aircraft==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Aircraft\n! Number\n!

It was the fourth aircraft and the first to have the features and the shape of the future production aircraft. It was the first to fly to the United States (on 20 September 1973 to Dallas, Texas). For several years the aircraft was painted in British Airways colours on one side and Air France colours on the other. It made 314 flights (656 hours), of which 189 were supersonic, and was then retired to [[Orly Airport]] in Paris on 20 May 1976, where it is on display to the public.\n\n==Development aircraft==\n\nThe production aircraft were different in many ways from the original aircraft, necessitating re-examining certain areas to obtain certification.

Until 2010, the aircraft was open for public viewing at the [[Airbus UK|Airbus]] facility; since 2017 it has been the main exhibit at Filton's [[Aerospace Bristol]] museum.<ref name= AB>{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospacebristol.org/|title= Aerospace Bristol|accessdate=24 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs part of tenth-anniversary celebrations on 24 December 1985, British Airways photographed G-BOAA, G-BOAC, G-BOAF and G-BOAG [[formation flying]] for their publicity material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concordesst.com/history/events/10.html|title=10th Anniversary Formation Flight 24th December 1985|accessdate=31 August 2013|work=Concorde SST}}</ref>\n\n==French production aircraft==\nAir France also had seven production aircraft in commercial service:\n*'''F-BTSC''' (203) was the Concorde lost in the crash of [[Air France Flight 4590]] on 25 July 2000 in the small town of Gonesse, France near Le Bourget, located just outside Paris, killing 113 people. The remains of this aircraft are stored at a hangar at Le Bourget Airport. It is the only Concorde in the history of the Concorde aircraft to be destroyed in a crash. It was also featured in the Airport film series ''[[The Concorde ... Airport '79]]''. It first flew on 31 January 1975 from Toulouse and flew for 11,989 hours.\n[[File:Concorde F-BVFA (205) at Smithsonian.jpg|thumb|right|Concorde F-BVFA on display at Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, USA.]]\n*'''F-BVFA''' (205) First flew on 27 October 1975 from Toulouse. In 1988 it flew around the world in a record-breaking 41 hours 27 minutes. It made its final flight to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Air and Space Museum]]'s new [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] (USA) on 12 June 2003 after flying 17,824 hours.\n*'''F-BVFB''' (207) first flew on 6 March 1976 from Toulouse. It was sold for [[Euro|\u20ac1]] to the [[Sinsheim Auto & Technik Museum]] in Germany. It flew to [[Baden Airpark|Karlsruhe-Baden\u2013Baden Airpark]], in south west Germany on 24 June 2003. After removal of its wings and tail fin, it travelled by barge and road, to join a [[Tupolev Tu-144]] already on exhibit at Sinsheim. It had flown 14,771 hours.\n*'''F-BVFC''' (209) first flew on 9 July 1976 from Toulouse. It was retired to the [[Airbus]] plant at Toulouse, where the French aircraft were constructed, on 27 June 2003, joining '''201''' and ending Air France's relationship with Concorde. The final flight was supersonic, and included a [[go around]] at Toulouse. It had flown 14,332 hours. Since January 2015, it is on display outside the Aeroscopia museum near the Toulouse factory.\n*'''F-BVFD''' (211) first flew on 10 February 1977 from Toulouse. It was retired early, in 1982, having flown only 5,814 hours (final flight on 27 May 1982). Badly corroded after being stored outdoors, and damaged through use as a source of spare parts, it was broken up in 1994. It was the only Concorde scrapped before retirement. A small section of the fuselage remains at Le Bourget, France and the nose cone was sold to an American collector.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n*'''F-BTSD''' (213) first flew on 26 June 1978 from Toulouse. It was retired to the Air and Space museum at Le Bourget (France) on 14 June 2003, joining '''001''' after flying 12,974 hours. In 1996, this aircraft carried a promotional paint scheme (blue with logo) for [[Pepsi]]. The wings were kept white, and while in the Pepsi livery, it was restricted to flying at most 20 minutes at Mach 2.02 and otherwise Mach 1.7 (the plane normally requires a white livery to fly supersonic, because of the heat);<ref name=Jolivet>{{cite web |title=Pepsi Blue Concorde 1996 |url=https://www.heritageconcorde.com/pepsi-blue-concorde-1996 |website=Heritage Concorde}}</ref> the branding estimated to have cost Pepsi $20 million{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. It flew 16 flights around the Middle East in this livery.<ref name=Jolivet/> The plane also holds the world record for flying around the world in both directions: westbound in 32 hours 49 minutes and 3 seconds on 12/13 October 1992, and eastbound in 31 hours 27 minutes and 49 seconds on 15/16 August 1995. It also was the only Concorde to land in Central America and then it set a new time record between [[Juan Santamaria International Airport]] and [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]].\n*'''F-BVFF''' (215) first flew on 26 December 1978 from Toulouse. It was undergoing D-check maintenance at the Air France maintenance hangar at Charles de Gaulle at the time of the 25 July 2000 crash which temporarily grounded all Concordes. After the withdrawal of the type was announced midway through refurbishment, it was cosmetically reassembled on the outside (outer shell only, no interior) and used as a display piece following the retirement of all Concordes. It last flew on a charter flight to Paris Charles de Gaulle on 11 June 2000 after flying 12,421 hours.\n\n==List of aircraft==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Aircraft\n! Number\n!

After three years of [[Touring theatre|touring]] they came back to the United Kingdom.\n\n== Chrysalis Theatre Acting School ==\nThe couple studied the formation of the art of [[Voice acting|dramatic speech]] and [[gesture]] created by Austrian philosopher, [[social reformer]], [[Architecture|architect]] and [[Esotericism|esotericist]] [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861\u20131925). They started the '''Boundaries Theatre Company''' which became their own drama school in 1975, the Chrysalis Theatre Acting School in the same [[London]] building they had bought in [[Balham]]. The theatre' venue had been used by the [[Spiritualist Association of Great Britain]] until then. The students who came from all over the world such as Japan or certain [[African countries]] included [[Spanish citizenship|Spanish]] actress Luz Altamira or Sir [[Mark Rylance]]. The school lasted for thirty years. In the 1990s both of them gave training in [[Voice acting|voice]] and [[gesture]] to the professional company of the [[Shakespeare's Globe]]. Peter also gave courses in both the United States and throughout Europe during the same period.\n\n== La Cris\u00e1lida ==\nBridgmont supported the '''La Cris\u00e1lida Studio''', the first school focused on the 'Art of [[Speech]]' in [[Spain]], founded by his pupils speech artist '''Luz Altamira''' and [[Goya Awards]]-nominated thespian '''\u00c1lvaro Ramos''' as well as actress and author '''Pilar Altamira''' member of the '[[Anthroposophical Society]] of [[Spain]]'.

I use the word 'persona' carefully, as they taught me how to move with sound, through sound, persona. In our visual-material age, sound is the great undiscovered or forgotten land for actors and audiences. Reason and Emotion are all very well in speech, much needed, but with Peter and Barbara I learnt of the limbs of speech, the feet, the legs, the arms, the great will and beautiful spirit to move with speech. Just as a marvellous javelin thrower wills his spear down the pitch to the winning distance and harnesses every muscle necessary in perfect balance to achieve his aim, so, when appropriate, we speak in space and silence. It was a lucky day for me when I met them; they know some great secrets and forgotten pathways.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberationofacting.com/|title=FOREWORD by Mark

After three years of [[Touring theatre|touring]] they came back to the United Kingdom.\n\n== Chrysalis Theatre Acting School ==\nThe couple studied the formation of the art of [[Voice acting|dramatic speech]] and [[gesture]] created by Austrian philosopher, [[social reformer]], [[Architecture|architect]] and [[Esotericism|esotericist]] [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861\u20131925). They started the '''Boundaries Theatre Company''' which became their own drama school in 1975, the Chrysalis Theatre Acting School in the same [[London]] building they had bought in [[Balham]]. The theatre' venue had been used by the [[Spiritualist Association of Great Britain]] until then. The students who came from all over the world such as Japan or certain [[African countries]] included [[Spanish citizenship|Spanish]] actress Luz Altamira or Sir [[Mark Rylance]]. The school lasted for thirty years. In the 1990s both of them gave training in [[Voice acting|voice]] and [[gesture]] to the professional company of the [[Shakespeare's Globe]].

I use the word 'persona' carefully, as they taught me how to move with sound, through sound, persona. In our visual-material age, sound is the great undiscovered or forgotten land for actors and audiences. Reason and Emotion are all very well in speech, much needed, but with Peter and Barbara I learnt of the limbs of speech, the feet, the legs, the arms, the great will and beautiful spirit to move with speech. Just as a marvellous javelin thrower wills his spear down the pitch to the winning distance and harnesses every muscle necessary in perfect balance to achieve his aim, so, when appropriate, we speak in space and silence. It was a lucky day for me when I met them; they know some great secrets and forgotten pathways.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberationofacting.com/|title=FOREWORD by Mark Rylance|last=Rylance|first=Mark|date=27 August 2015|website=Liberation of Acting|access-date=11 August 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n* ''\"Readers who are interested in the Art of Drama may also wish to refer to The Liberation of The Actor (1992) by Peter Bridgmont\"''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rhythms of Learning: What Waldorf Education Offers Children, Parents & Teachers|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|publisher=SteinerBooks|year=1998|isbn=9780880104517|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== British Film Institute Archives ==\nA r\u00e9pertoire of Bridgmont's voice work for the year 1966 is available at the [[British Film Institute]] archives as follows:\n* 1966: ''The Sword Must Be Kept Sharp'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]].\n* 1966: ''What Did Greece Matter?'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''It Will Proceed to the End'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''One Perplexity after Another'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''We Are on the Edge of a Precipice'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''Not a Penny off the Pay'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].\n* 1966: ''It Has Advanced the Footlights'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''Your Death Knell Has Sounded'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''War Is Re-enthroned'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''We Neither Govern Not Misgovern'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].\n* 1966: ''The Popular Masses Are Dull'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''Germany Is Reawakening'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''There Lies a Sleeping Giant'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''Who Can Conquer the Street...'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''On the Idle Hill of Summer'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''Make Room for Peace'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''There Is a Great Tide Turning'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Anton Diffring]].\n* 1966: ''This Is Such a Time'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].\n* 1966: ''Boys You Have Been Betrayed'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''Now I Can Die'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].\n* 1966: ''Long Live the War'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]] and [[Felix Felton]].\n* 1966: ''What Hand Would Not Wither'' also featuring [[Michael Redgrave]], Robert Ayres and [[David Bauer (actor)|David Bauer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bc891e6a8|title=Voice work 1966 Bridgmont|date=1 January 2017|website=British Film Institute (BFI)|access-date=11 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Honours ==\n* The documentary on Peter and Barbara directed by [[Spanish citizenship|Spanish]] actor and director \u00c1lvaro Ramos which was eponymously titled '''The Chrysalis''' (2009) won the Best Documentary award at the High Desert International Film Festival in [[Nevada]], United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clandestinodeactores.com/alvaro-ramos|title=Alvaro's work|date=5 May 2015|website=Clandestino de Actores|access-date=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nPeter's son, Andrew Bridgmont, is also an accomplished actor himself who notably starred in [[Matthew Vaughn]]'s ''[[Kingsman: The Secret Service]]'' (2014), [[James Marsh (director)|James Marsh]]'s ''[[The Theory of Everything (2014 film)|The Theory of Everything]]'' (2014) or ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' (2014\u20132016).\n\n== External links ==\n* Bridgmont's [http://www.liberationofacting.com/ official website].\n\n== Sources ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bridgmont, Peter}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century English male actors]]\n[[Category:English male dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:English male film actors]]\n[[Category:English male Shakespearean actors]]\n[[Category:English male stage actors]]\n[[Category:English male television actors]]\n[[Category:English theatre directors]]\n[[Category:Royal Shakespeare Company members]]\n[[Category:Guildhall School of Music and Drama]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "name_user": "\u62d3\u8dcb\u6c0f \u99ac", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bridgmont"}

I use the word 'persona' carefully, as they taught me how to move with sound, through sound, persona. In our visual-material age, sound is the great undiscovered or forgotten land for actors and audiences. Reason and Emotion are all very well in speech, much needed, but with Peter and Barbara I learnt of the limbs of speech, the feet, the legs, the arms, the great will and beautiful spirit to move with speech. Just as a marvellous javelin thrower wills his spear down the pitch to the winning distance and harnesses every muscle necessary in perfect balance to achieve his aim, so, when appropriate, we speak in space and silence.

There are now of ten key players in the [[Streetwaer|streatwear]] industry in addition to the founders. Among the ten key players are art director Kweku Yeboah and public relations executive Mecha Clarke.
