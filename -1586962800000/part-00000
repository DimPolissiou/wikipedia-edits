It is thus an [[extracorporeal]] therapy.\n\nThe apheresis machine was invented by American medical technologist Herb Cullis in 1972.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Did you know? 10 Historical Facts about Blood Transfusion\n| first = | last = \n| website = \n| date = \n| accessdate = 2019-01-23\n| url = https://www.nzblood.co.nz/news/2015/did-you-know-10-historical-facts-about-blood-transfusion/\n| language =  \n| quote = \n}}</ref>\n\nOne of the uses of apheresis is for collecting stem cells.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Official CPC Certification Study Guide|last=Katherine|first=Abel|publisher=American Medical Association|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=128}}</ref> \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Method ==\n\nDepending on the substance that is being removed, different processes are employed in apheresis. If separation by [[density]] is required, [[centrifugation]] is the most common method. Other methods involve absorption onto beads coated with an absorbent material and filtration.\n\nThe centrifugation method can be divided into two basic categories:\n\n=== Continuous flow centrifugation ===\n\nContinuous flow centrifugation (CFC) historically required two [[venipunctures]] as the \"continuous\" means the blood is collected, spun, and returned simultaneously. Newer systems can use a single venipuncture. The main advantage of this system is the low extracorporeal volume (calculated by volume of the apheresis chamber, the donor's [[hematocrit]], and total blood volume of the donor) used in the procedure, which may be advantageous in the elderly and for children.\n\n=== Intermittent flow centrifugation ===\n\nIntermittent flow centrifugation works in cycles, taking blood, spinning/processing it and then giving back the unused parts to the donor in a [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]]. The main advantage is a single venipuncture site. To stop the blood from [[Coagulation|coagulating]], [[anticoagulant]] is automatically mixed with the blood as it is pumped from the body into the apheresis machine.\n\n=== Centrifugation variables ===\n\nThe centrifugation process itself has four variables that can be controlled to selectively remove desired components. The first is spin speed and bowl diameter, the second is \"sit time\" in centrifuge, the third is solutes added, and the fourth is not as easily controllable: plasma volume and cellular content of the donor. The end product in most cases is the classic sedimented blood sample with the [[Red blood cells|RBC's]] at the bottom, the [[buffy coat]] of platelets and [[White blood cells|WBC's]] ([[lymphocytes]]/[[granulocytes]], [[Polymorphonuclear leukocytes|PMN's]], [[basophils]], [[eosinophils]]/[[monocytes]]) in the middle and the plasma on top.\n\n== Types ==\n\n[[Image:Blood donation needle.jpg|thumb|480px|Disinfect, insert the cannula, pull out the cannula, dress the wound. The blue pressure cuff is controlled by the platelet apheresis machine in newer models.]]\n\nThere are numerous types of apheresis.\n\n=== Donation ===\n\nBlood taken from a healthy donor can be separated into its component parts during [[blood donation]], where the needed component is collected and the \"unused\" components are returned to the donor. [[Fluid replacement]] is usually not needed in this type of collection.  There are large categories of component collections:\n\n* [[Plasmapheresis]] \u2013 [[blood plasma]]. Plasmapheresis is useful in collecting FFP (fresh frozen plasma) of a particular ABO group.  Commercial uses aside from FFP for this procedure include immunoglobulin products, plasma derivatives, and collection of rare WBC and RBC antibodies.\n* [[Erythrocytapheresis]] \u2013 [[red blood cells]].  Erythrocytapheresis is the separation of [[erythrocytes]] from whole blood.  It is most commonly accomplished using the method of centrifugal sedimentation.

Some advocate using [[fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP) or a similar blood product, but there are dangers including citrate toxicity (from the anticoagulant), [[ABO incompatibility]], [[infection]], and cellular [[antigen]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Leukoreduction]]\n* [[Plasmapheresis]]\n* [[Venipuncture]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/red_cells.html NIH]\n* [http://www.apheresis.org American Society for Apheresis]\n* [http://stemcellthailand.org/pheresis-blood-platelet-donation-apheresis-hemapheresis Apheresis in Blood Platelet Donation]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050408114722/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBAPHER.html WebPath] Apheresis page.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041205170749/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBPROC.html WebPath] Blood Donation and Processing\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081103014400/http://www.thebloodconnection.org/blood_products.aspx#platelets Donating Platelet Apheresis: Facts and the FAQ]\n\n{{transfusion medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Hematology]]\n[[Category:Medical treatments]]\n[[Category:Nephrology procedures]]\n[[Category:Transfusion medicine]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the linguistic term|Apheresis (linguistics)}}\n{{redirect-distinguish|Pheresis|Phoresis}}\n{{More footnotes|article|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox interventions |\n  Name        = Apheresis |\n  Image       = Image:Apheresis.svg |\n  Caption     = Whole blood enters the centrifuge (1) and separates into plasma (2), leukocytes (3), and erythrocytes (4).

If separation by [[density]] is required, [[centrifugation]] is the most common method. Other methods involve absorption onto beads coated with an absorbent material and filtration.\n\nThe centrifugation method can be divided into two basic categories:\n\n=== Continuous flow centrifugation ===\n\nContinuous flow centrifugation (CFC) historically required two [[venipunctures]] as the \"continuous\" means the blood is collected, spun, and returned simultaneously. Newer systems can use a single venipuncture. The main advantage of this system is the low extracorporeal volume (calculated by volume of the apheresis chamber, the donor's [[hematocrit]], and total blood volume of the donor) used in the procedure, which may be advantageous in the elderly and for children.\n\n=== Intermittent flow centrifugation ===\n\nIntermittent flow centrifugation works in cycles, taking blood, spinning/processing it and then giving back the unused parts to the donor in a [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]]. The main advantage is a single venipuncture site. To stop the blood from [[Coagulation|coagulating]], [[anticoagulant]] is automatically mixed with the blood as it is pumped from the body into the apheresis machine.\n\n=== Centrifugation variables ===\n\nThe centrifugation process itself has four variables that can be controlled to selectively remove desired components. The first is spin speed and bowl diameter, the second is \"sit time\" in centrifuge, the third is solutes added, and the fourth is not as easily controllable: plasma volume and cellular content of the donor. The end product in most cases is the classic sedimented blood sample with the [[Red blood cells|RBC's]] at the bottom, the [[buffy coat]] of platelets and [[White blood cells|WBC's]] ([[lymphocytes]]/[[granulocytes]], [[Polymorphonuclear leukocytes|PMN's]], [[basophils]], [[eosinophils]]/[[monocytes]]) in the middle and the plasma on top.\n\n== Types ==\n\n[[Image:Blood donation needle.jpg|thumb|480px|Disinfect, insert the cannula, pull out the cannula, dress the wound. The blue pressure cuff is controlled by the platelet apheresis machine in newer models.]]\n\nThere are numerous types of apheresis.\n\n=== Donation ===\n\nBlood taken from a healthy donor can be separated into its component parts during [[blood donation]], where the needed component is collected and the \"unused\" components are returned to the donor. [[Fluid replacement]] is usually not needed in this type of collection.  There are large categories of component collections:\n\n* [[Plasmapheresis]] \u2013 [[blood plasma]]. Plasmapheresis is useful in collecting FFP (fresh frozen plasma) of a particular ABO group.  Commercial uses aside from FFP for this procedure include immunoglobulin products, plasma derivatives, and collection of rare WBC and RBC antibodies.\n* [[Erythrocytapheresis]] \u2013 [[red blood cells]].  Erythrocytapheresis is the separation of [[erythrocytes]] from whole blood.  It is most commonly accomplished using the method of centrifugal sedimentation.  This process is used for red blood cell diseases such as sickle cell crises or severe malaria.

That fluid must be replaced to keep correct intravascular volume. The fluid replaced is different at different institutions. If a [[Volume expander#Types|crystalloid]] like [[normal saline]] (NS) is used, the infusion amount should be triple what is removed as the 3:1 ratio of normal saline for plasma is needed to keep up [[oncotic pressure]]. Some institutions use [[normal serum albumin]], but it is costly and can be difficult to find. Some advocate using [[fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP) or a similar blood product, but there are dangers including citrate toxicity (from the anticoagulant), [[ABO incompatibility]], [[infection]], and cellular [[antigen]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Leukoreduction]]\n* [[Plasmapheresis]]\n* [[Venipuncture]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/red_cells.html NIH]\n* [http://www.apheresis.org American Society for Apheresis]\n* [http://stemcellthailand.org/pheresis-blood-platelet-donation-apheresis-hemapheresis Apheresis in Blood Platelet Donation]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050408114722/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBAPHER.html WebPath] Apheresis page.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041205170749/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBPROC.html WebPath] Blood Donation and Processing\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081103014400/http://www.thebloodconnection.org/blood_products.aspx#platelets Donating Platelet Apheresis: Facts and the FAQ]\n\n{{transfusion medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Hematology]]\n[[Category:Medical treatments]]\n[[Category:Nephrology procedures]]\n[[Category:Transfusion medicine]]\n", "name_user": "Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m", "label": "safe", "comment": "rowspan", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apheresis"}

She is a rising star of the ensemble cast and works hard to be the best comedian she can be. Sonny often tries to solve the ongoing feud between the ''Mackenzie Falls'' and ''So Random!'' casts, especially when she dates the star of \"Mackenzie Falls,\" Chad Dylan Cooper. She was Chad's girlfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice\". As seen in further episodes, all of her co-stars are very fond of her. She does not appear in ''[[So Random!]]'', due to Lovato's departure.\n* [[Tiffany Thornton]] as Tawni Hart\n*: Tawni is a main cast member of \"So Random!\" who is jealous of Sonny. She originally feared Sonny was moving in on her spotlight and acted meanly towards the newcomer. However, after a while, the two become best friends. Tawni is a [[diva]]; she loves mirrors, make-up and everything about herself. She is self-centered, but also talented and has a soft side. She has a similar personality to Chad. She prefers to wear \"Coco Mocho Coco\" lipstick, as stated in many episodes.\n* [[Sterling Knight]] as Chad Dylan Cooper\n*: Chad is a teen heartthrob as the star on ''Mackenzie Falls'', the rival teen TV series of ''So Random!''. He is stubborn, egotistical, pampered, and self-centered, but he has a soft side, which he usually only shows to Sonny. He and Sonny had a love-hate relationship until the 2nd season when he was Sonny's boyfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice.\" As a result of this romance, he started to warm up to the ''So Random!'' cast and eventually started to \"hang out\" with them. It is shown that he still has feelings for Sonny in the episode after they split. In the first season, he was seen as a stubborn, vain young man, but in later episodes, he has changed to be more loving and kind. Throughout season 1 he displays feelings for Sonny. For example, in the episode \"Sonny with a Chance of Dating\" Chad was jealous when he found out Sonny was going on a date with James. In addition, in the same episode, when Chad and Sonny were fake dating, Chad said to put her head on his shoulder hinting that he likes her. In the episode, \"You've got Fan Mail\", Sonny seems touched that Chad actually cared enough to dress up as Eric for her. Chad tries to cover it up by saying he just wanted to try on the beard that went along with the Eric costume. Again, in episode 16 of the first season, \"Sonny in the Kitchen with Dinner\", Chad becomes jealous when he sees the news on a magazine about Sonny kissing Hayden because of the kiss cam.\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as Nico Harris\n*: Nico is a cast member of ''So Random!'' who is best friends with Grady. He is always striking out with the girls and has a crush on ''Mackenzie Falls'' star Penelope, who constantly turns him down when he asks her out. A running gag throughout the series is Nico jumping into Grady's arms when he gets scared. He is said to have been discovered in a one-man band.\n* [[Doug Brochu]] as Grady Mitchell\n*: Grady is a cast member of ''So Random!''. He is best friends with Nico who often calls him \"G\". Grady is always involved in strange plans with Nico. He is shown to be dull-witted, gullible and immature. He also comes up with very strange conclusions to certain situations. He loves to eat and hates exercising. He claims to be an expert lip-reader, but very often misreads his targets' mouths and comes up with non-sensical sentences. In the episode \"The New Girl\" he tells Nico that when he's around a girl that he believes likes him, he will turn into a Scotsman named Seamus McGregor. He has a big brother named Grant who is in college and is the leader of his own fraternity.\n* [[Allisyn Ashley Arm]] as Zora Lancaster\n*: Zora is the youngest cast member of ''So Random!''. She is very smart, mysterious, crazy and clever. She is the most cunning of the 'So Random!' cast and is known as \"the weird one\". She often pops out of nowhere, surprising her friends. She is somewhat a detective and puts her skills to use in the \"So Random\" studio. She listens in on her friends' conversations and then shocks them by speaking to them about it later on. She appeared sporadically throughout the second season.\n\n==Production==\nThe original working title for the series was ''Sketchpad!'', and the original name for the main character was Molly Munroe. The show's title was later changed to ''Welcome to Mollywood''. After the first publicity materials about the show were released, the lead character's name was then changed to Holli and the title changed once again to ''Welcome to Holliwood''. The main character's name was later changed to Sonny Munroe, and the show's title was changed for a final time to ''Sonny with a Chance''. The name is a play on the words \"Sunny with a chance of rain\", as heard in weather forecasts, reflecting the many comical situations in which the cast find themselves in each episode. Originally Lovato auditioned with [[Bridgit Mendler]] for the role, but Lovato was chosen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|title=Lemonade Mouth Star: Bridgit Mendler|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=December 14, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925105138/http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|archivedate=September 25, 2013}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}\n\n''Sonny with a Chance'' has a [[story within a story|show-within-a-show]], ''So Random!'', complete with fully produced sketches.

It often causes the cast of ''Sonny with a Chance'' to dress in ridiculous costumes, and act out nonsensical situations. This was spun-off to its own series after Lovato's departure.<ref name=\"omg.yahoo.com\" />\n\n===''Mackenzie Falls''===\nThe enemies of the ''So Random!'' group, ''Mackenzie Falls'' is a [[tween (demographic)|tween]] [[drama series]] featuring comedic overacting. The show is similar to ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', among others. The show's name, ''Mackenzie Falls'', comes from Chad's character's name and the name of the town (which is located near a [[waterfall]]). In the season two episode \"The Legend of Candy Face\", the cast of ''So Random!'' made a parody of ''Mackenzie Falls'' titled ''Mackenzie [[Public toilet|Stalls]]'', which was set in a [[bathroom]]. Minisodes and promos can be seen on the ''Sonny with a Chance'' website along with one minisode as a bonus feature on the DVD.\n\n==Theme song and opening sequence==\nThe show's theme song \"So Far, So Great\", was written and produced by Jeanne Lurie, Chen Neeman and Aristedis \"Aris\" Archontis, who have each written songs for several artists on Disney-owned [[Hollywood Records]]. It is performed by series actress Demi Lovato. The theme is of pop-rock style (the music cues composed by Chris Alan Lee and Scott Clausen, signaling scene changes and commercial breaks are styled similarly).\n\nA full-length version of this theme was released via the [[Radio Disney]] network on March 31, 2009, less than two months after the show's U.S. premiere. The theme song is also featured as a track on the Disney compilation album, ''[[Disney Channel Playlist]]'', released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on June 9, 2009. The song is also available as the bonus track on Lovato's second album ''[[Here We Go Again (Demi Lovato album)|Here We Go Again]]'', released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 21, 2009.\n\nIn the [[Russian language|Russian]] version of the series (\"\u0414\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438 \u0448\u0430\u043d\u0441\" aka Give Sonny a Chance), the cast members' names are rendered in [[Cyrillic]]\u2014and the intro is performed by a different Russian girl in Russian (not by Demi Lovato).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7TJ50fSJrE |title=Sonny With a Chance Russian opening (season 2) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> Otherwise, in translation the intro music is not changed.\n\nIn the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] version (\"Sunny Entre Estrelas\"), the intro music is sung in translation.\n\n==Broadcast==\n\n===Season 1===\nThe series originally premiered on February 8, 2009 on [[Disney Channel]], [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]], and [[Disney Channel (UK and Ireland)]].

Yes, that's unusual, but that is the official spelling. -->nroe\n*: Sonny is a friendly, eccentric and well-intentioned teenage girl from [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]], [[Wisconsin]] who lands a main role on her favorite comedy sketch television show, ''[[So Random!]].'' She is a rising star of the ensemble cast and works hard to be the best comedian she can be. Sonny often tries to solve the ongoing feud between the ''Mackenzie Falls'' and ''So Random!'' casts, especially when she dates the star of \"Mackenzie Falls,\" Chad Dylan Cooper. She was Chad's girlfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice\". As seen in further episodes, all of her co-stars are very fond of her. She does not appear in ''[[So Random!]]'', due to Lovato's departure.\n* [[Tiffany Thornton]] as Tawni Hart\n*: Tawni is a main cast member of \"So Random!\" who is jealous of Sonny. She originally feared Sonny was moving in on her spotlight and acted meanly towards the newcomer. However, after a while, the two become best friends. Tawni is a [[diva]]; she loves mirrors, make-up and everything about herself. She is self-centered, but also talented and has a soft side. She has a similar personality to Chad. She prefers to wear \"Coco Mocho Coco\" lipstick, as stated in many episodes.\n* [[Sterling Knight]] as Chad Dylan Cooper\n*: Chad is a teen heartthrob as the star on ''Mackenzie Falls'', the rival teen TV series of ''So Random!''. He is stubborn, egotistical, pampered, and self-centered, but he has a soft side, which he usually only shows to Sonny. He and Sonny had a love-hate relationship until the 2nd season when he was Sonny's boyfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice.\" As a result of this romance, he started to warm up to the ''So Random!'' cast and eventually started to \"hang out\" with them. It is shown that he still has feelings for Sonny in the episode after they split. In the first season, he was seen as a stubborn, vain young man, but in later episodes, he has changed to be more loving and kind. Throughout season 1 he displays feelings for Sonny. For example, in the episode \"Sonny with a Chance of Dating\" Chad was jealous when he found out Sonny was going on a date with James. In addition, in the same episode, when Chad and Sonny were fake dating, Chad said to put her head on his shoulder hinting that he likes her. In the episode, \"You've got Fan Mail\", Sonny seems touched that Chad actually cared enough to dress up as Eric for her. Chad tries to cover it up by saying he just wanted to try on the beard that went along with the Eric costume. Again, in episode 16 of the first season, \"Sonny in the Kitchen with Dinner\", Chad becomes jealous when he sees the news on a magazine about Sonny kissing Hayden because of the kiss cam.\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as Nico Harris\n*: Nico is a cast member of ''So Random!'' who is best friends with Grady. He is always striking out with the girls and has a crush on ''Mackenzie Falls'' star Penelope, who constantly turns him down when he asks her out. A running gag throughout the series is Nico jumping into Grady's arms when he gets scared. He is said to have been discovered in a one-man band.\n* [[Doug Brochu]] as Grady Mitchell\n*: Grady is a cast member of ''So Random!''. He is best friends with Nico who often calls him \"G\". Grady is always involved in strange plans with Nico. He is shown to be dull-witted, gullible and immature. He also comes up with very strange conclusions to certain situations. He loves to eat and hates exercising. He claims to be an expert lip-reader, but very often misreads his targets' mouths and comes up with non-sensical sentences. In the episode \"The New Girl\" he tells Nico that when he's around a girl that he believes likes him, he will turn into a Scotsman named Seamus McGregor. He has a big brother named Grant who is in college and is the leader of his own fraternity.\n* [[Allisyn Ashley Arm]] as Zora Lancaster\n*: Zora is the youngest cast member of ''So Random!''. She is very smart, mysterious, crazy and clever. She is the most cunning of the 'So Random!' cast and is known as \"the weird one\". She often pops out of nowhere, surprising her friends. She is somewhat a detective and puts her skills to use in the \"So Random\" studio. She listens in on her friends' conversations and then shocks them by speaking to them about it later on. She appeared sporadically throughout the second season.\n\n==Production==\nThe original working title for the series was ''Sketchpad!'', and the original name for the main character was Molly Munroe. The show's title was later changed to ''Welcome to Mollywood''. After the first publicity materials about the show were released, the lead character's name was then changed to Holli and the title changed once again to ''Welcome to Holliwood''. The main character's name was later changed to Sonny Munroe, and the show's title was changed for a final time to ''Sonny with a Chance''. The name is a play on the words \"Sunny with a chance of rain\", as heard in weather forecasts, reflecting the many comical situations in which the cast find themselves in each episode. Originally Lovato auditioned with [[Bridgit Mendler]] for the role, but Lovato was chosen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|title=Lemonade Mouth Star: Bridgit Mendler|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=December 14, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925105138/http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|archivedate=September 25, 2013}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}\n\n''Sonny with a Chance'' has a [[story within a story|show-within-a-show]], ''So Random!'', complete with fully produced sketches.

It often causes the cast of ''Sonny with a Chance'' to dress in ridiculous costumes, and act out nonsensical situations.

The show is similar to ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', among others. The show's name, ''Mackenzie Falls'', comes from Chad's character's name and the name of the town (which is located near a [[waterfall]]). In the season two episode \"The Legend of Candy Face\", the cast of ''So Random!'' made a parody of ''Mackenzie Falls'' titled ''Mackenzie [[Public toilet|Stalls]]'', which was set in a [[bathroom]]. Minisodes and promos can be seen on the ''Sonny with a Chance'' website along with one minisode as a bonus feature on the DVD.\n\n==Theme song and opening sequence==\nThe show's theme song \"So Far, So Great\", was written and produced by Jeanne Lurie, Chen Neeman and Aristedis \"Aris\" Archontis, who have each written songs for several artists on Disney-owned [[Hollywood Records]]. It is performed by series actress Demi Lovato. The theme is of pop-rock style (the music cues composed by Chris Alan Lee and Scott Clausen, signaling scene changes and commercial breaks are styled similarly).\n\nA full-length version of this theme was released via the [[Radio Disney]] network on March 31, 2009, less than two months after the show's U.S. premiere. The theme song is also featured as a track on the Disney compilation album, ''[[Disney Channel Playlist]]'', released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on June 9, 2009. The song is also available as the bonus track on Lovato's second album ''[[Here We Go Again (Demi Lovato album)|Here We Go Again]]'', released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 21, 2009.\n\nIn the [[Russian language|Russian]] version of the series (\"\u0414\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438 \u0448\u0430\u043d\u0441\" aka Give Sonny a Chance), the cast members' names are rendered in [[Cyrillic]]\u2014and the intro is performed by a different Russian girl in Russian (not by Demi Lovato).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7TJ50fSJrE |title=Sonny With a Chance Russian opening (season 2) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> Otherwise, in translation the intro music is not changed.\n\nIn the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] version (\"Sunny Entre Estrelas\"), the intro music is sung in translation.\n\n==Broadcast==\n\n===Season 1===\nThe series originally premiered on February 8, 2009 on [[Disney Channel]], [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]], and [[Disney Channel (UK and Ireland)]].
