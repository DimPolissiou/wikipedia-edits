The Inspector is not answerable to ICAC in any way and is located in physically separate premises from the ICAC. The Inspector's role includes: undertaking audits of the ICAC\u2019s operations to ensure compliance with the law; dealing with complaints about the conduct of the ICAC and current and former officers; and assessing the effectiveness and appropriateness of the ICAC's procedures.\n\nThe Inspector has extensive powers to investigate the conduct of the ICAC and its officers including obtaining documents from the ICAC and requiring ICAC officers to attend before him and answer questions. The Inspector can also sit as a [[Royal Commissioner]] in order to conduct investigations. As a Royal Commissioner the Inspector has extensive powers to compel witnesses to provide evidence. The Inspector can deal with complaints about the conduct of the ICAC or its officers which concern abuses of power, impropriety, misconduct of any kind, lengthy delays in investigation and maladministration. Under the ICAC Act maladministration is defined as action or inaction of a serious nature that is contrary to law, or unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory, or based wholly or partly on improper motives.\n\n==Structure and operation==\nThe ICAC has jurisdiction over [[Government of New South Wales|state]] and [[local government in New South Wales]].

The commission is charged with educating public authorities, officials and members of the public about corruption.<ref name=\"iut\"/>\n\n== Inspector ==\n\nThe '''Inspector of the Independent Commission Against Corruption''' is an independent statutory officer whose role and functions is to hold the ICAC accountable in the way it carries out its function.<ref name=\"OIICAC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oiicac.nsw.gov.au/|website=Office of the Inspector of the Independent Commission Against Corruption|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]] |title=The Inspector of the Independent Commission Against Corruption |accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref> The Inspector\u2019s role are set out in Part 5A of the ICAC Act. The Inspector is not answerable to ICAC in any way and is located in physically separate premises from the ICAC. The Inspector's role includes: undertaking audits of the ICAC\u2019s operations to ensure compliance with the law; dealing with complaints about the conduct of the ICAC and current and former officers; and assessing the effectiveness and appropriateness of the ICAC's procedures.\n\nThe Inspector has extensive powers to investigate the conduct of the ICAC and its officers including obtaining documents from the ICAC and requiring ICAC officers to attend before him and answer questions. The Inspector can also sit as a [[Royal Commissioner]] in order to conduct investigations. As a Royal Commissioner the Inspector has extensive powers to compel witnesses to provide evidence. The Inspector can deal with complaints about the conduct of the ICAC or its officers which concern abuses of power, impropriety, misconduct of any kind, lengthy delays in investigation and maladministration. Under the ICAC Act maladministration is defined as action or inaction of a serious nature that is contrary to law, or unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory, or based wholly or partly on improper motives.\n\n==Structure and operation==\nThe ICAC has jurisdiction over [[Government of New South Wales|state]] and [[local government in New South Wales]]. This extends to parliamentarians, local councillors, the [[Governor of New South Wales]], public servants, and staff of universities and state-owned corporations.<ref>But not now police:  since 1996 the NSW Police Force has been subject to the [[Police Integrity Commission]].</ref>  Anyone can refer a matter to the commission.

The commissioner served a single five-year term and cannot be dismissed except by the Governor.<ref name=\"NSW Legislation\"/> Following the passage of the ''Independent Commission Against Corruption Amendment Act 2016'' (NSW), the agency was reconstituted as a three-member Commission, comprising a chief commissioner and two other commissioners; and in order for a public hearing to be held as part of any corruption investigation, the chief commissioner and at least one other commissioner must agree.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.timebase.com.au/news/2016/AT3984-article.html |title=NSW Government's Independent Commission Against Corruption Overhaul Passes Parliament |work=TimeBase |publisher= |date=17 November 2016 |access-date=23 November 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nThe 1980s saw a number of corruption scandals break around Australia, involving the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] administrations in New South Wales, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]] ([[WA Inc]]), the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] government in [[Tasmania]] and the [[National Party of Australia|Nationals]] administration in [[Queensland]] ([[Fitzgerald Inquiry]]).\n\nIn 1988, Nick Greiner, a Liberal, ran against Labor in New South Wales on an anti-corruption platform and won.

The High Court found that, in this context, \"adversely affect\" means \"adversely affect or could adversely affect the ''probity'' of the exercise of an official function by a public official\" and not \"adversely affect or could adversely affect the ''efficacy'' of the exercise of an official function by a public official in the sense that the official could exercise the function in a different manner or make a different decision from that which would otherwise be the case\".

They are in differing stages of upkeep, with some in a semi-ruined state.<ref name=Ghatesh/>\n\nThere are 8 major temples in Baroli and a ninth about one kilometre away. Four temples are dedicated to [[Shiva]] (including Ghateshwara Mahadeva Temple), two to [[Durga]] and one each to Shiva-Trimurti, [[Vishnu]] and [[Ganesha]].<ref name=Ghatesh/>\n\nThe [[Nataraja]] (Natesha) images carved in these temples are similar to those seen at Upramala. The sculpture has 16 arms and its headdress is matted.

One linga appears like an inverted ''ghata'' or pot, and hence the name given to the temple of \"Ghateshwara\" (pot-Lord), while \"Mahadeva\" is a term for Shiva. The sanctum has a ceiling in the form of a large blossoming [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]]. The temple has a finely carved [[shikara]](pinnacle) above the sanctum.<ref name=Ghatesh/><ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/> The superstructure has been described as a ''latina'' and the pinnacle is a ''phamsana''.

Shiva's mount [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] (the bull) is installed between the ''mukhamandapa'' and the sanctum. The niches inside the temple are decorated with elegantly carved images of [[Andhakantaka]] (shiva slaying the demon [[Andhaka]]), [[Nataraja]] (Shiva as the Lord of dance) and the goddess [[Chamunda]]; similar images are also carved on the [[lintel]] above the entrance door. The ''mukhamandapa'' also has many carved images of semi-clad, dancing ''[[apsara]]''s (heavenly nymphs). The ceiling is decorated with concentric forms with coiffured cusps.<ref name=\"Ghatesh\"/>\n\nThe ''Sringar Chauri'' or ''rangamandapa'' (the hall of dance) is a later addition to the temple, situated just outside it. The large pillared hall is built over a raised platform called a ''[[pitha]]'', which has decorative carvings. The [[transepts]] of the hall have co-axial entrances, both on the east and the west, ensconced in ''kakshasana'' [[balustrades]]. The four central pillars supporting the hall are very well ornamented. The images include the river goddesses [[Ganga]] and [[Yamuna]] as ''[[dwarapalas]]'' (door-keepers), the trinity images of [[Brahma]]-Vishnu-Shiva, and several depictions of Shiva in his different incarnations.

The ''Pancharatha''-style sanctum is topped by the ten-tiered shikhara, built in the Nagara style, separated by ''bhumi-amalakas'', ''[[amalaka]]''s (crowns) separating the tiers (''bhumi''). The entrance door to the sanctum has three panels (''tri-sakha''). A dancing [[Matrika|Maheshvari]] is carved on the lintel as the ''Lalatabimba''. A carved [[Parvati]] image occupies the central niche in the ''sukanasa'' (portion of the pinnacle over the portico).

The system was first observed on August 13 at low latitudes east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It grew to be a powerful, slow-moving hurricane in the [[Caribbean Sea]], and at 00:00 [[UTC]] on August 17, it struck Puerto Rico at the equivalence of Category 3 on the modern-day [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. The [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] crossed the island from southeast to northwest in about seven hours. This was the first tropical cyclone event in Puerto Rico for which [[History of Atlantic hurricane warnings|warning flags]] were used in conveying the level of danger to the public. A prolonged period of strong winds caused widespread destruction on the island, most notably along the northern coast. Large numbers of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, with flimsy shacks belonging to poor workers faring the worst; many families were left homeless. Telegraph communications were severed across the island. In addition to the intense winds, several days of heavy rainfall in interior sectors triggered extensive river flooding. The combined effects of rain and wind destroyed fields of crops, most notably coffee and sugar cane. Four people were killed in Puerto Rico.\n\nOn August 19, the hurricane began to turn northeastward, accelerate, and gradually weaken. Although its center remained far from the [[United States]], heavy rainfall and gale-force winds overspread the country's [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] on August 20 and 21. Eastern [[New England]] experienced conditions akin to a particularly bad [[nor'easter]], with winds as high as {{convert|72|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} recorded on [[Block Island]]. Across [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]], grain crops were flattened and orchards were stripped of their fruits. The racing yacht [[Volunteer (yacht)|''Volunteer'']] was badly damaged, and a fishing [[schooner]] sank off [[Nantucket]]; only one of the seven crew-members managed to survive by clinging to debris for 33 hours. At 00:00 UTC on August 22, the now-rapidly moving cyclone made landfall in Nova Scotia. Damage to utility wires in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] cut power and communications services, and a child was killed by a downed power line. The storm wrought havoc on ships and boats throughout [[Atlantic Canada]], as well as the [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]] of [[Quebec]], becoming \"one of the most notorious marine storms in the history of Nova Scotia\".<ref name=\"wreck\"/> The greatest maritime tragedy was the wreck of the [[steamship]] ''Dorcas'' and its barge, ''Etta Stewart'', which were caught in the gale while underway east of Halifax. The two ships drifted toward shore late at night on August 21, and struck a rocky [[shoal]] near the entrance to [[Three Fathom Harbour, Nova Scotia|Three Fathom Harbour]]. ''Dorcas'' capsized and was driven ashore, while ''Etta Stewart'' broke up in the pounding surf. All crew members and passengers on the two vessels, totaling 24 people, were killed. Two more people died when their boat sank on [[Trinity Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Trinity Bay]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], for a storm total of 37 fatalities.  \n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|1893 Atlantic hurricane 3 track.png}}\nBecause of scarce meteorological observations, little is known about Hurricane San Roque's early history.

The system was first observed on August 13 at low latitudes east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It grew to be a powerful, slow-moving hurricane in the [[Caribbean Sea]], and at 00:00 [[UTC]] on August 17, it struck Puerto Rico at the equivalence of Category 3 on the modern-day [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. The [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] crossed the island from southeast to northwest in about seven hours. This was the first tropical cyclone event in Puerto Rico for which [[History of Atlantic hurricane warnings|warning flags]] were used in conveying the level of danger to the public. A prolonged period of strong winds caused widespread destruction on the island, most notably along the northern coast. Large numbers of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, with flimsy shacks belonging to poor workers faring the worst; many families were left homeless. Telegraph communications were severed across the island. In addition to the intense winds, several days of heavy rainfall in interior sectors triggered extensive river flooding. The combined effects of rain and wind destroyed fields of crops, most notably coffee and sugar cane. Four people were killed in Puerto Rico.\n\nOn August 19, the hurricane began to turn northeastward, accelerate, and gradually weaken. Although its center remained far from the [[United States]], heavy rainfall and gale-force winds overspread the country's [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] on August 20 and 21. Eastern [[New England]] experienced conditions akin to a particularly bad [[nor'easter]], with winds as high as {{convert|72|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} recorded on [[Block Island]]. Across [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]], grain crops were flattened and orchards were stripped of their fruits. The racing yacht [[Volunteer (yacht)|''Volunteer'']] was badly damaged, and a fishing [[schooner]] sank off [[Nantucket]]; only one of the seven crew-members managed to survive by clinging to debris for 33 hours. At 00:00 UTC on August 22, the now-rapidly moving cyclone made landfall in Nova Scotia. Damage to utility wires in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] cut power and communications services, and a child was killed by a downed power line. The storm wrought havoc on ships and boats throughout [[Atlantic Canada]], as well as the [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]] of [[Quebec]], becoming \"one of the most notorious marine storms in the history of Nova Scotia\".<ref name=\"wreck\"/> The greatest maritime tragedy was the wreck of the [[steamship]] ''Dorcas'' and its barge, ''Etta Stewart'', which were caught in the gale while underway east of Halifax. The two ships drifted toward shore late at night on August 21, and struck a rocky [[shoal]] near the entrance to [[Three Fathom Harbour, Nova Scotia|Three Fathom Harbour]]. ''Dorcas'' capsized and was driven ashore, while ''Etta Stewart'' broke up in the pounding surf. All crew members and passengers on the two vessels, totaling 24 people, were killed. Two more people died when their boat sank on [[Trinity Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Trinity Bay]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], for a storm total of 37 fatalities.  \n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|1893 Atlantic hurricane 3 track.png}}\nBecause of scarce meteorological observations, little is known about Hurricane San Roque's early history.
