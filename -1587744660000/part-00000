He argued that there was a policy of limiting the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests, which together with the exclusion of the ICD-10 category ''U07.2'' implied an underestimate of the true COVID-19 death toll.<ref name=\"NewsweekPl_Karczmarek\" /><ref name=\"Polityka_U07p2_ignored\" /> NIPH\u2013NIH stated that the omission was unintentional due to the timing, and updated its instructions on 1 April, instructing doctors to also use the ''U07.2'' definition of clinically or epidemiologically classified COVID-19 cases.<ref name=\"GazWyb_U072\" /> NIPH\u2013NIH stated that the WHO considered it \"irrelevant\" to distinguish between ''U07.1'' and ''U07.2''. On 6 April, Bartosz Fia\u0142ek, a Polish rheumatologist, claimed that the NIPH\u2013NIH instructions were unclear, and that it appeared that ''U07.2'' was not being used for COVID-19 deaths in hospital in which SARS-CoV-2 tests had not been carried out, nor for people dying of COVID-19 in quarantine.<ref name=\"OKOpress_U07p2_stillunclear\" />\n\n===Suspected COVID-19 deaths in quarantine===\nOn 21 March 2020, a 45-year-old man who was quarantined in [[G\u0142og\u00f3w]] after returning from outside of Poland and who had shown COVID-19 symptoms was found dead by police.

Followers of these religions perceive behavior as being tightly connected with health; illnesses are often thought to be a result of moral failure or insufficiently honoring one's family in current or past life. Furthermore, an emphasis on social harmony may discourage people with mental illness from bringing attention to themselves and seeking help. They may also refuse to speak about their mental illness because of the shame it would bring upon themselves and their family members, who could also be held responsible and experience social isolation.\n\nAlso, reputation might be a factor that prevents individuals from seeking professional help.

In a Chinese household, every individual shares the responsibility of maintaining and raising the family's reputation. It is believed that mental health will hinder individuals from achieving the standards and goals- whether academic, social, career-based, or other- expected from parents. Without reaching the expectations, individuals are anticipated to bring shame to the family, which will affect the family's overall reputation. Therefore, mental health issues are seen as an unacceptable weakness. This perception of mental health disorders causes individuals to internalize their mental health problems, possibly worsening them, and making it difficult to seek treatment. Eventually, it becomes ignored and overlooked by families.\n\nIn addition, many of these philosophies teach followers to accept one's fate.<ref name=\":3\" /> Consequently, people with mental disorders may be less inclined to seek medical treatment because they believe they should not actively try to prevent any symptoms that may manifest.

In the 1980s, researchers mostly focused on the physical health of soldiers, but as the troop's ability to perform their services declined, the government began looking toward on mental health to provide an explanation for this trend. In the 1990s, research on mental health increased with the hope that by improving the mental health of soldiers, combat effectiveness may also increase.<ref>Wang, X., He. X. (2015) Progress of Chinese Military Mental Health. ''J Third Mil Med Univ'', ''37(22)'' pp. 2213-2217   </ref>\n\nIn addition to impacting active military member's effectiveness in the army, mental health issues can create lasting effects affect them after they leave the military. Plateaus were an area of interest in this sense, because of the combination of harsh environmental conditions with low atmospheric pressure and intense UV radiation,<ref name=\":6\">Tan, Y., Li, Y., Wu, J., Chen, F., Lu, H., Lu, S., Yang, X., \u2026 Ma, X. (2018). Mental health of Automobile Transportation Troop personnel stationed in the Western Sichuan Plateau of China. ''Medicine'', ''97''(12),</ref> and the necessity of the work done there. It was critical to place the military there to stabilize the outskirts and protect the Chinese citizens who live nearby, thus making it one of the most important jobs in the army- and, subsequently, increasing the pressure on those who worked in the plateaus. The plateaus not only affect the body physically, like in the arteries, lungs, and back, but also caused high levels of depression in soldiers because of being from family members and with limited communication methods. Scientists found that this may impact their lives as they saw that this population had higher rates of divorce and lower rates of employment.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nComparatively, assessing the mental health status of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is difficult, because military members work a diverse array of duties over a large landscape. In addition to combat, military members also play an active part in disaster relief, peacekeeping in foreign lands, protecting borders, and domestic riot control. In a study of 11,000 soldiers, researchers found that those who work as peacekeepers have higher levels of depression compared to those who work in the engineering and medical departments.<ref>Sun, X., Zhao, L., Chen, C., Cui, X., Guo, J., Zhang, L.

Furthermore, in over 73 studies that together included 53,424 military members, some research shows that there is gradual improvement in mental health at high altitudes, such as mountain tops,<ref name=\":5\" /> but other researchers found that at higher altitudes, depressive symptoms can worsen.<ref>Feng Zhengzhi ,Qin, D.(2008) A Meta-Analysis Concerning the Mental Health Status of Members of the Chinese Army.

In 2013 leak by the [[Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy|Tibetan Center for Human Rights]] of a small portion of the [[People's Liberation Army]] training manual from 2008, specifically concerned how military personnel could combat PTSD and depression while on peacekeeping missions in Tibet. The manual suggested that soldiers should: <blockquote>'''''\u201c...close [their] eyes and imagine zooming in on the scene like a camera [when experiencing PTSD]. It may feel uncomfortable.

Followers of these religions perceive behavior as being tightly connected with health; illnesses are often thought to be a result of moral failure or insufficiently honoring one's family in current or past life. Furthermore, an emphasis on social harmony may discourage people with mental illness from bringing attention to themselves and seeking help. They may also refuse to speak about their mental illness because of the shame it would bring upon themselves and their family members, who could also be held responsible and experience social isolation.\n\nAlso, reputation might be a factor that prevents individuals from seeking professional help.

In a Chinese household, every individual shares the responsibility of maintaining and raising the family's reputation. It is believed that mental health will hinder individuals from achieving the standards and goals- whether academic, social, career-based, or other- expected from parents. Without reaching the expectations, individuals are anticipated to bring shame to the family, which will affect the family's overall reputation. Therefore, mental health issues are seen as an unacceptable weakness. This perception of mental health disorders causes individuals to internalize their mental health problems, possibly worsening them, and making it difficult to seek treatment. Eventually, it becomes ignored and overlooked by families.\n\nIn addition, many of these philosophies teach followers to accept one's fate.<ref name=\":3\" /> Consequently, people with mental disorders may be less inclined to seek medical treatment because they believe they should not actively try to prevent any symptoms that may manifest. They may also be less likely to question the stereotypes associated with people with mental illness, and instead agreeing with others that they deserve to be ostracized.\n\n===Lack of qualified staff===\nChina has 17,000 certified [[psychiatrist]]s, which is 10 percent of that of other developed countries per capita.<ref name=\"economist\">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9657086|title=And now the 50-minute hour: Mental health in China|date=2007-08-18|accessdate=2007-08-18|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|pages=35}}</ref>  China averages one psychologist for every 83,000 people, and some of these psychologists are not board-licensed or certified to diagnose illnesses.

In the 1980s, researchers mostly focused on the physical health of soldiers, but as the troop's ability to perform their services declined, the government began looking toward on mental health to provide an explanation for this trend. In the 1990s, research on mental health increased with the hope that by improving the mental health of soldiers, combat effectiveness may also increase.<ref>Wang, X., He. X. (2015) Progress of Chinese Military Mental Health. ''J Third Mil Med Univ'', ''37(22)'' pp. 2213-2217   </ref>\n\nIn addition to impacting active military member's effectiveness in the army, mental health issues can create lasting effects affect them after they leave the military. Plateaus were an area of interest in this sense, because of the combination of harsh environmental conditions with low atmospheric pressure and intense UV radiation,<ref name=\":6\">Tan, Y., Li, Y., Wu, J., Chen, F., Lu, H., Lu, S., Yang, X., \u2026 Ma, X. (2018). Mental health of Automobile Transportation Troop personnel stationed in the Western Sichuan Plateau of China. ''Medicine'', ''97''(12),</ref> and the necessity of the work done there. It was critical to place the military there to stabilize the outskirts and protect the Chinese citizens who live nearby, thus making it one of the most important jobs in the army- and, subsequently, increasing the pressure on those who worked in the plateaus. The plateaus not only affect the body physically, like in the arteries, lungs, and back, but also caused high levels of depression in soldiers because of being from family members and with limited communication methods. Scientists found that this may impact their lives as they saw that this population had higher rates of divorce and lower rates of employment.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nComparatively, assessing the mental health status of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is difficult, because military members work a diverse array of duties over a large landscape. In addition to combat, military members also play an active part in disaster relief, peacekeeping in foreign lands, protecting borders, and domestic riot control. In a study of 11,000 soldiers, researchers found that those who work as peacekeepers have higher levels of depression compared to those who work in the engineering and medical departments.<ref>Sun, X., Zhao, L., Chen, C., Cui, X., Guo, J., Zhang, L.

Furthermore, in over 73 studies that together included 53,424 military members, some research shows that there is gradual improvement in mental health at high altitudes, such as mountain tops,<ref name=\":5\" /> but other researchers found that at higher altitudes, depressive symptoms can worsen.<ref>Feng Zhengzhi ,Qin, D.(2008) A Meta-Analysis Concerning the Mental Health Status of Members of the Chinese Army.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -
