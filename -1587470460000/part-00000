He signed for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as a youth trainee in July 1999 and the following month he signed professional terms with the club. He played numerous times for the youth and [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve]] sides at United and was part of the team that won the [[Manchester Senior Cup]] in  May 2000. He had a short spell on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] at Belgian club [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]] in 2001 before returning to United and making his senior debut in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] tie against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] during the [[2001\u201302 Manchester United F.C. season|2001\u201302 season]].

He signed for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as a youth trainee in July 1999 and the following month he signed professional terms with the club. He played numerous times for the youth and [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve]] sides at United and was part of the team that won the [[Manchester Senior Cup]] in  May 2000. He had a short spell on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] at Belgian club [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]] in 2001 before returning to United and making his senior debut in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] tie against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] during the [[2001\u201302 Manchester United F.C. season|2001\u201302 season]]. He was an England youth international as he progressed from the [[England national under-16 football team|under-16s]] to the [[England national under-20 football team|under-20s]] during his time at [[Old Trafford]].\n\nDavis spent three months on loan with [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] club [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in 2002 and scored three goals in 15 appearances. He was a mainstay in the reserves on his return to United; his only involvement with the first team after returning was as an unused [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a league game against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]  and a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] second group stage match against [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a]]. In July 2003, he joined [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on season-long loan. \n\nDavis was killed on the morning on 9 August 2003 when his car was in a collision with a [[Truck|lorry]] whilst travelling southbound on the [[M40 motorway|M40]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. He was due to make his debut for Watford against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] that afternoon.

As such, USB devices often do not have user-adjustable interface settings.\n* The USB interface is [[Hot swapping|hot-swappable]] (devices can be exchanged without rebooting the host computer). \n* Small devices can be powered directly from the USB interface, eliminating the need for additional power supply cables.\n* Because use of the USB logo is only permitted after [[Conformance testing|compliance testing]], the user can have confidence that a USB device will work as expected without extensive interaction with settings and configuration.\n* The USB interface defines protocols for recovery from common errors, improving reliability over previous interfaces.<ref name=JA2015/> \n* Installation of a device relying on the USB standard requires minimal operator action. When a device is plugged into a port on a running personal computer system, it is either entirely automatically configured using existing [[Device driver|device drivers]], or the system prompts the user to locate a driver which is then installed and configured automatically.\n\nThe USB standard also provides multiple benefits for hardware manufacturers and software developers, specifically in the relative ease of implementation:\n* The USB standard eliminates the requirement to develop proprietary interfaces to new peripherals. \n* The wide range of transfer speeds available from a USB interface suits devices ranging from keyboards and mice up to streaming video interfaces. \n* A USB interface can be designed to provide the best available [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] for time-critical functions, or can be set up to do background transfers of bulk data with little impact on system resources. \n* The USB interface is generalized with no signal lines dedicated to only one function of one device.<ref name=JA2015/>\n\n===Limitations===\nAs with all standards, USB possesses multiple limitations to its design:\n* USB cables are limited in length, as the standard was intended for peripherals on the same table-top, not between rooms or buildings. However, a USB port can be connected to a [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] that accesses distant devices. \n* USB has a strict [[tree network]] topology and [[Master/slave (technology)|master/slave]] protocol for addressing peripheral devices; those devices cannot interact with one another except via the host, and two hosts cannot communicate over their USB ports directly. Some extension to this limitation is possible through [[USB On-The-Go]]. \n* A host cannot broadcast signals to all peripherals at once\u2014each must be addressed individually. Some very high speed peripheral devices require sustained speeds not available in the USB standard.<ref name=JA2015/> \n* While converters exist between certain [[Legacy system|legacy interfaces]] and USB, they may not provide full implementation of the legacy hardware. For example, a USB-to-parallel-port converter may work well with a printer, but not with a scanner that requires bi-directional use of the data pins.\n\nFor a product developer, use of USB requires implementation of a complex protocol and implies an \"intelligent\" controller in the peripheral device. Developers of USB devices intended for public sale generally must obtain a USB ID which requires a fee paid to the [[USB Implementers Forum]]. Developers of products that use the USB specification must sign an agreement with the Implementers Forum. Use of the USB logos on the product require annual fees and membership in the organization.<ref name=JA2015/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:USB Icon.svg|thumb|right|alt=Large circle is left end of horizontal line.

Additional [[USB hub]]s may be included, allowing up to five tiers. A USB host may have multiple controllers, each with one or more ports. Up to 127 devices may be connected to a single host controller.<ref>{{cite book | title = Universal Serial Bus Specification Revision 2.0 | pages = 13; 30; 256 | format = [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] | url = http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb_20_101111.zip | date = 11 October 2011 | accessdate = 2012-09-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120528075527/http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb_20_101111.zip | archivedate = 28 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"spec_3.0\" />{{rp|at=8\u201329}} USB devices are linked in series through hubs. The hub built into the host controller is called the ''root hub''.\n\nA USB device may consist of several logical sub-devices that are referred to as ''device functions''. A ''composite device'' may provide several functions, for example, a [[webcam]] (video device function) with a built-in microphone (audio device function). An alternative to this is a ''[[compound device]],'' in which the host assigns each logical device a distinct address and all logical devices connect to a built-in hub that connects to the physical USB cable.\n\n[[File:USB pipes and endpoints (en).svg|thumb|alt=Diagram: inside a device are several endpoints, each of which is connected by a logical pipes to a host controller. Data in each pipe flows in one direction, although there are a mixture going to and from the host controller.|USB endpoints reside on the connected device: the channels to the host are referred to as pipes]]\n\nUSB device communication is based on ''pipes'' (logical channels). A pipe is a connection from the host controller to a logical entity within a device, called an ''[[communication endpoint|endpoint]]''. Because pipes correspond to endpoints, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Each USB device can have up to 32 endpoints (16 ''in'' and 16 ''out''), though it is rare to have so many. Endpoints are defined and numbered by the device during initialization (the period after physical connection called \"enumeration\") and so are relatively permanent, whereas pipes may be opened and closed.\n\nThere are two types of pipe: stream and message.\n* A ''message'' pipe is bi-directional and is used for ''control'' transfers. Message pipes are typically used for short, simple commands to the device, and for status responses from the device, used, for example, by the bus control pipe number 0.\n* A ''stream'' pipe is a uni-directional pipe connected to a uni-directional endpoint that transfers data using an ''isochronous'',<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.usb.org/developers/presentations/SuperSpeed_USB_DevCon_Isochronous_Froelich.pdf\n |title       = Isochronous Protocol\n |date        = 2009-05-20\n |accessdate  = 2014-11-21\n |author      = Dan Froelich\n |website     = usb.org\n |format      = PDF\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140817061140/http://www.usb.org/developers/presentations/SuperSpeed_USB_DevCon_Isochronous_Froelich.pdf\n |archivedate = 17 August 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> ''interrupt'', or ''bulk'' transfer:\n*;Isochronous transfers: At some guaranteed data rate (for fixed-bandwidth streaming data) but with possible data loss (e.g., realtime audio or video)\n*;Interrupt transfers: Devices that need guaranteed quick responses (bounded latency) such as pointing devices, [[Computer mouse|mice]], and keyboards\n*;Bulk transfers: Large sporadic transfers using all remaining available bandwidth, but with no guarantees on bandwidth or latency (e.g., file transfers)\n\nWhen a host starts a data transfer, it sends a TOKEN packet containing an endpoint specified with a [[tuple]] of ''(device_address, endpoint_number)''. If the transfer is from the host to the endpoint, the host sends an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) with the desired device address and endpoint number. If the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.\n\n[[File:USB 2 and 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Rectangular opening where the width is twice the height. The opening has a metal rim, and within the opening a flat rectangular bar runs parallel to the top side.|Two USB&nbsp;3.0 Standard-A receptacles (left) and two USB&nbsp;2.0 Standard-A receptacles (right) on a computer's front panel]]\n\nEndpoints are grouped into ''interfaces'' and each interface is associated with a single device function. An exception to this is endpoint zero, which is used for device configuration and is not associated with any interface. A single device function composed of independently controlled interfaces is called a ''composite device''. A composite device only has a single device address because the host only assigns a device address to a function.\n\nWhen a USB device is first connected to a USB host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The data rate of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device's information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the device is supported by the host, the [[device driver]]s needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.\n\nThe host controller directs traffic flow to devices, so no USB device can transfer any data on the bus without an explicit request from the host controller. In USB&nbsp;2.0, the host controller [[Polling (computer science)|polls]] the bus for traffic, usually in a [[Round-robin scheduling|round-robin]] fashion. The throughput of each USB port is determined by the slower speed of either the USB port or the USB device connected to the port.\n\nHigh-speed USB&nbsp;2.0 hubs contain devices called transaction translators that convert between high-speed USB&nbsp;2.0 buses and full and low speed buses. There may be one translator per hub or per port.\n\nBecause there are two separate controllers in each USB&nbsp;3.0 host, USB&nbsp;3.0 devices transmit and receive at USB&nbsp;3.0 data rates regardless of USB&nbsp;2.0 or earlier devices connected to that host. Operating data rates for earlier devices are set in the legacy manner.\n\n== {{Anchor|PHDC}}Device classes ==\nThe functionality of a USB device is defined by a class code sent to a USB host. This allows the host to load software modules for the device and to support new devices from different manufacturers.\n\nDevice classes include:<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.usb.org/defined-class-codes | title = USB Class Codes | date = 22 September 2018 | via=www.usb.org | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180922111633/https://www.usb.org/defined-class-codes | archivedate = 22 September 2018 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

At first intended for magnetic and optical drives, it has been extended to support [[USB flash drive|flash drives]]. It has also been extended to support a wide variety of novel devices as many systems can be controlled with the familiar metaphor of file manipulation within directories. The process of making a novel device look like a familiar device is also known as extension. The ability to boot a write-locked [[SD card]] with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, pristine state of the booting medium.\n\nThough most personal computers since early 2005 can boot from USB mass storage devices, USB is not intended as a primary bus for a computer's internal storage. However, USB has the advantage of allowing [[hot-swapping]], making it useful for mobile peripherals, including drives of various kinds.\n\nSeveral manufacturers offer external portable USB [[hard disk drive]]s, or empty enclosures for disk drives. These offer performance comparable to internal drives, limited by the current number and types of attached USB devices, and by the upper limit of the USB interface. Other competing standards for external drive connectivity include [[eSATA]], [[ExpressCard]], [[FireWire]] (IEEE 1394), and most recently [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]].\n\nAnother use for USB mass storage devices is the portable execution of software applications (such as web browsers and VoIP clients) with no need to install them on the host computer.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/portable-software-usb/ | title = 100 Portable Apps for your USB Stick (both for Mac and Win) | accessdate = 2008-10-30 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202121455/http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/portable-software-usb/ | archivedate = 2 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.VoIP-Download.com/Skype.htm#USB/ | title = Skype VoIP USB Installation Guide | accessdate = 2008-10-30 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140706153501/http://www.voip-download.com/Skype.htm#USB/ | archivedate = 6 July 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Media Transfer Protocol ===\n{{See also|Picture Transfer Protocol}}\n[[Media Transfer Protocol]] (MTP) was designed by [[Microsoft]] to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, at the level of files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]] features. MTP was designed for use with [[portable media player]]s, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol{{snd}} an evolution of MTP). The primary reason for this is that MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.\n\n=== Human interface devices ===\n{{Main |USB human interface device class}}\nJoysticks, keypads, tablets and other human-interface devices (HIDs) are also progressively{{when|date=February 2016}} migrating from MIDI, and PC [[game port]] connectors to USB.{{Citation needed |date=November 2011}}\n\nUSB mice and keyboards can usually be used with older computers that have [[PS/2 port|PS/2 connectors]] with the aid of a small USB-to-PS/2 adapter. For mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support, an adaptor that contains no [[Electronic circuit|logic circuitry]] may be used: the [[USB hardware]] in the keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a USB or PS/2 port, and communicate using the appropriate protocol. Converters also exist that connect PS/2 keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to a USB port.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.startech.com/Server-Management/KVM-Switches/PS-2-to-USB-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Adapter~PS22USB | title = PS/2 to USB Keyboard and Mouse Adapter | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141112214808/http://www.startech.com/Server-Management/KVM-Switches/PS-2-to-USB-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Adapter~PS22USB |website=StarTech.com | archivedate = 12 November 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> These devices present two HID endpoints to the system and use a [[microcontroller]] to perform bidirectional data translation between the two standards.\n\n=== {{Anchor|DFU}}Device Firmware Upgrade ===\n''Device Firmware Upgrade'' (DFU) is a vendor- and device-independent mechanism for upgrading the [[firmware]] of USB devices with improved versions provided by their manufacturers, offering (for example) a way to deploy firmware bug fixes. During the firmware upgrade operation, USB devices change their operating mode effectively becoming a [[Programmable read-only memory|PROM]] programmer. Any class of USB device can implement this capability by following the official DFU specifications.<ref name=\"dfu-1.1\" /><ref name=BadUSB>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/usbdfu10.pdf\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140824054756/http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/usbdfu10.pdf\n | title = Universal Serial Bus Device Class Specification for Device Firmware Upgrade, Version 1.0\n | date = 1999-05-13 | accessdate = 2014-09-08 | archivedate = 2014-08-24\n | publisher = USB Implementers Forum\n | format = PDF | pages = 7\u20138\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/dfu-util/\n | title = rpms/dfu-util: USB Device Firmware Upgrade tool\n | date = 2014-05-14\n | accessdate = 2014-09-08\n | website = fedoraproject.org\n}}</ref>\n\nDFU can also give the user the freedom to flash USB Devices with alternative firmware. One consequence of this is that USB devices after being re-flashed may act as various unexpected device types. For example, a USB Device intended by the seller to be just a Flash drive can \"spoof\" an input device like a keyboard; see [[BadUSB]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://srlabs.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SRLabs-BadUSB-BlackHat-v1.pdf\n |title       = BadUSB \u2013 On accessories that turn evil\n |date        = 2014-08-07\n |accessdate  = 2014-09-08\n |author1     = Karsten Nohl\n |author2     = Sascha Kri\u00dfler\n |author3     = Jakob Lell\n |website     = srlabs.de\n |publisher   = Security Research Labs\n |format      = PDF\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140808142747/https://srlabs.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SRLabs-BadUSB-BlackHat-v1.pdf\n |archivedate = 8 August 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Audio streaming ===\nThe USB Device Working Group has laid out specifications for audio streaming, and specific standards have been developed and implemented for audio class uses, such as microphones, speakers, headsets, telephones, musical instruments, etc. The DWG has published three versions of audio device specifications:<ref>{{Cite press release |date=27 September 2016 |title=USB-IF Announces USB Audio Device Class 3.0 Specification |location=Houston, Texas & Beaverton, Oregon |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160927006252/en/USB-IF-Announces-USB-Audio-Device-Class-3.0 |website=Business Wire |access-date=2018-05-04 |language=en }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/ |title=USB Device Class Specifications |website=www.usb.org |access-date=2018-05-04 }}</ref> Audio&nbsp;1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, referred to as \"UAC\"<ref name=\"xmos2015\" /> or \"ADC\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/usb-2-0-audio-drivers |title=USB Audio 2.0 Drivers |website=Microsoft Hardware Dev Center |language=en-us |access-date=2018-05-04 |quote=ADC-2 refers to the USB Device Class Definition for Audio Devices, Release 2.0.}}</ref>\n\nUAC 2.0 introduced support for High Speed USB (in addition to Full Speed), allowing greater bandwidth for multi-channel interfaces, higher sample rates,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |url=http://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/KB/USB.html |title=USB |website=The Well-Tempered Computer |last=Kars |first=Vincent |date=May 2011 |access-date=2018-05-07 |quote=All operating systems (Win, OSX, and Linux) support USB Audio Class 1 natively.

This is one of many types of [[USB connector]].]]\nBy design, it is difficult to insert a USB plug into its receptacle incorrectly. The USB specification requires that the cable plug and receptacle be marked so the user can recognize the proper orientation.<ref name=\"spec_3.0\" /> The USB-C plug however is reversible. USB cables and small USB devices are held in place by the gripping force from the receptacle, with no screws, clips, or thumb-turns as some connectors use.\n\nThe different A and B plugs prevent accidentally connecting two power sources. However, some of this directed topology is lost with the advent of multi-purpose USB connections (such as [[USB On-The-Go]] in smartphones, and USB-powered Wi-Fi routers), which require A-to-A, B-to-B, and sometimes Y/splitter cables.\n\nUSB connector types multiplied as the specification progressed. The original USB specification detailed standard-A and standard-B plugs and receptacles. The connectors were different so that users could not connect one computer receptacle to another. The data pins in the standard plugs are recessed compared to the power pins, so that the device can power up before establishing a data connection. Some devices operate in different modes depending on whether the data connection is made.  Charging docks supply power and do not include a host device or data pins, allowing any capable USB device to charge or operate from a standard USB cable. Charging cables provide power connections, but not data. In a charge-only cable, the data wires are shorted at the device end, otherwise the device may reject the charger as unsuitable.\n\n== {{Anchor|CABLING}}Cabling ==\n[[File:Cables in Hong Kong.JPG|thumb|right|A variety of USB cables for sale in [[Hong Kong]]]]\n{{Main|USB hardware#Cabling}}  \n \nThe USB&nbsp;1.1 standard specifies that a standard cable can have a maximum length of {{convert|5|m|ftin|sp=us}} with devices operating at full speed (12&nbsp;Mbit/s), and a maximum length of {{convert|3|m|ftin|sp=us}} with devices operating at low speed (1.5&nbsp;Mbit/s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cablesplususa.com/pdf/USB_Cable_Length_Limitations.pdf |title=USB Cable Length Limitations |publisher=cablesplususa.com |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2014-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011015850/http://www.cablesplususa.com/pdf/USB_Cable_Length_Limitations.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-usb-cable |title=What is the Maximum Length of a USB Cable? |publisher=Techwalla.com |accessdate=2017-11-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043247/https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-usb-cable |archivedate=1 December 2017  }}</ref><ref name=\"faq\"/>\n\nUSB&nbsp;2.0 provides for a maximum cable length of {{convert|5|m|ftin|sp=us}} for devices running at high speed (480&nbsp;Mbit/s).<ref name=\"faq\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.usb.org/developers/usbfaq/#cab1 | title = Cables and Long-Haul Solutions | work = USB 2.0 Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = USB Implementers Forum | accessdate = 2019-04-28 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110118225750/http://www.usb.org/developers/usbfaq/#cab1 | archivedate = 18 January 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe USB&nbsp;3.0 standard does not directly specify a maximum cable length, requiring only that all cables meet an electrical specification: for copper cabling with [[American wire gauge|AWG]]&nbsp;26 wires the maximum practical length is {{convert|3|m|ftin|sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=USB 3.0 Developers FAQ |url=http://janaxelson.com/usb3faq.htm#ca_maximum |accessdate=2016-10-20 |last=Axelson |first=Jan |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220073858/http://www.janaxelson.com/usb3faq.htm#ca_maximum |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref>\n\n== {{Anchor|POWER}}Power ==\n{{Main|USB hardware#Power}}\n\nUSB supplies power at 5&nbsp;V&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;5% to power USB downstream devices.\n\n=== {{Anchor|HOST}}Low-power and high-power devices ===\nLow-power devices may draw at most 1 unit load (1 unit load is 100 mA for USB devices up to USB&nbsp;2.0, while USB&nbsp;3.0 defines a unit load as 150&nbsp;mA), and all devices must act as low-power devices when starting out as unconfigured.\n\nHigh-power devices (such as a typical 2.5-inch USB hard disc drive) draw at least 1 unit load and at most 5 unit loads (5x100mA = 500&nbsp;mA) for devices up to USB&nbsp;2.0 or 6 unit loads (6x150mA= 900&nbsp;mA) for SuperSpeed (USB 3.0 and up) devices.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+ USB power standards\n|-\n!

Link configuration is performed using LFPS (Low Frequency Periodic Signalling, approximately at 20&nbsp;MHz frequency), and electrical features include voltage de-emphasis at transmitter side, and adaptive linear equalization on receiver side in order to combat electrical losses in transmission lines, and thus the link introduces the concept of \"link training\".   \n* '''SuperSpeed+ (SS+)''' uses increased data rate (Gen 2\u00d71 mode) and/or the additional lane in the USB-C connector (Gen 1\u00d72 and Gen 2\u00d72 mode).\n\nA USB connection is always between a host or hub at the ''A'' connector end, and a device or hub's \"upstream\" port at the other end.\n\n== Protocol layer ==\n{{Main|USB (Communications)#Protocol layer}}\n\nDuring USB communication, data is transmitted as [[packet (information technology)|packets]]. Initially, all packets are sent from the host via the root hub, and possibly more hubs, to devices. Some of those packets direct a device to send some packets in reply.\n\n== Transactions ==\n{{Main|USB (Communications)#Transaction}}\n\nThe basic transactions of USB are:\n* OUT transaction  \n* IN transaction  \n* SETUP transaction  \n* Control transfer exchange\n\n== {{Anchor|HSIC|SSIC}}Related standards ==\n[[File:USB Wireless certified Logo.svg|thumb|right|The Wireless USB logo]]\nThe USB Implementers Forum is working on a [[wireless networking]] standard based on the USB protocol.{{When|date=March 2017}} [[Wireless USB]] is a cable-replacement technology, and uses [[ultra-wideband]] [[wireless technology]] for data rates of up to 480&nbsp;Mbit/s.\n\n[[InterChip USB]] is a chip-to-chip variant that eliminates the conventional transceivers found in normal USB. The HSIC [[physical layer]] uses about 50% less power and 75% less [[printed circuit board|board]] area compared to USB&nbsp;2.0.<ref>{{cite web |title= Interchip Connectivity: HSIC, UniPro, HSI, C2C, LLI... oh my! |url= http://info.arteris.com/blog/bid/59433/Interchip-Connectivity-HSIC-UniPro-HSI-C2C-LLI-oh-my |author=Kurt Shuler |date=2011-03-31 |accessdate= 2011-06-24 |website= Arteris IP |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110619022557/http://info.arteris.com/blog/bid/59433/Interchip-Connectivity-HSIC-UniPro-HSI-C2C-LLI-oh-my |archivedate= 19 June 2011 |df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Comparisons with other connection methods ==\n\n=== FireWire ===\nAt first, USB was considered a complement to [[IEEE 1394]] (FireWire) technology, which was designed as a high-bandwidth serial bus that efficiently interconnects peripherals such as disk drives, audio interfaces, and video equipment. In the initial design, USB operated at a far lower data rate and used less sophisticated hardware. It was suitable for small peripherals such as keyboards and pointing devices.\n\nThe most significant technical differences between FireWire and USB include:\n\n* USB networks use a [[star network|tiered-star]] topology, while IEEE&nbsp;1394 networks use a [[tree network|tree]] topology.\n* USB&nbsp;1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 use a \"speak-when-spoken-to\" protocol, meaning that each peripheral communicates with the host when the host specifically requests it to communicate. USB&nbsp;3.0 allows for device-initiated communications towards the host. A FireWire device can communicate with any other node at any time, subject to network conditions.\n* A USB network relies on a single host at the top of the tree to control the network. All communications are between the host and one peripheral. In a FireWire network, any capable node can control the network.\n* USB runs with a 5&nbsp;[[Volts|V]] power line, while FireWire in current implementations supplies 12&nbsp;V and theoretically can supply up to 30&nbsp;V.\n* Standard USB hub ports can provide from the typical 500&nbsp;mA/2.5&nbsp;W of current, only 100&nbsp;mA from non-hub ports. USB&nbsp;3.0 and USB On-The-Go supply 1.8&nbsp;A/9.0&nbsp;W (for dedicated battery charging, 1.5&nbsp;A/7.5&nbsp;W full bandwidth or 900&nbsp;mA/4.5&nbsp;W high bandwidth), while FireWire can in theory supply up to 60&nbsp;watts of power, although 10 to 20&nbsp;watts is more typical.\n\nThese and other differences reflect the differing design goals of the two buses: USB was designed for simplicity and low cost, while FireWire was designed for high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as audio and video. Although similar in theoretical maximum transfer rate, FireWire&nbsp;400 is faster than USB&nbsp;2.0 high-bandwidth in real-use,<ref>{{cite web|title=FireWire vs. USB 2.0|url=http://www.qimaging.com/support/pdfs/firewire_usb_technote.pdf|publisher=QImaging|accessdate=2010-07-20|format=PDF|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011050049/http://www.qimaging.com/support/pdfs/firewire_usb_technote.pdf|archivedate=11 October 2010}}</ref> especially in high-bandwidth use such as external hard drives.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cwol.com/firewire/firewire-vs-usb.htm |title= FireWire vs. USB&nbsp;2.0 \u2013 Bandwidth Tests |accessdate= 2007-08-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070812045719/http://www.cwol.com/firewire/firewire-vs-usb.htm |archivedate= 12 August 2007 |df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/usb-2-0-vs-firewire |title=USB&nbsp;2.0 vs FireWire |publisher=Pricenfees |accessdate=2007-08-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016063120/https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/usb-2-0-vs-firewire |archivedate=16 October 2016  }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,847716,00.asp |title=The Great Interface-Off: FireWire Vs.

They operate at 48&nbsp;V&nbsp;[[Direct current|DC]] and can supply more power (up to 12.95&nbsp;W for ''af'', 25.5&nbsp;W for ''at'' aka ''PoE+'', 71&nbsp;W for ''bt'' aka ''4PPoE'') over a cable up to 100&nbsp;meters compared to USB&nbsp;2.0, which provides 2.5&nbsp;W with a maximum cable length of 5&nbsp;meters. This has made PoE popular for [[VoIP]] telephones, [[security camera]]s, [[wireless access point]]s, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low.\n\n[[Ethernet]] standards require electrical isolation between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) and the network cable up to 1500&nbsp;V&nbsp;AC or 2250&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC for 60&nbsp;seconds.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.3-2008_section1.pdf | title = 802.3, Section 14.3.1.1 | format = PDF | publisher = IEEE | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101206030247/http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.3-2008_section1.pdf | archivedate = 6 December 2010 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> USB has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer, and in fact it connects the peripheral and host grounds.

However, Power over Ethernet and the [[MIDI]] plug standard have an advantage in high-end devices that may have long cables. USB can cause [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]] problems between equipment, because it connects ground references on both transceivers. By contrast, the MIDI plug standard and [[Ethernet]] have built-in isolation to {{gaps|500|V}} or more.\n\n=== eSATA/eSATAp ===\nThe [[eSATA]] connector is a more robust [[SATA]] connector, intended for connection to external hard drives and SSDs. eSATA's transfer rate (up to 6&nbsp;Gbit/s) is similar to that of USB&nbsp;3.0 (up to 5&nbsp;Gbit/s on current devices; 10&nbsp;Gbit/s speeds via USB&nbsp;3.1, announced on 31 July 2013). A device connected by eSATA appears as an ordinary SATA device, giving both full performance and full compatibility associated with internal drives.\n\neSATA does not supply power to external devices. This is an increasing disadvantage compared to USB. Even though USB&nbsp;3.0's 4.5&nbsp;W is sometimes insufficient to power external hard drives, technology is advancing and external drives gradually need less power, diminishing the eSATA advantage. [[eSATAp]] (power over eSATA; aka ESATA/USB) is a connector introduced in 2009 that supplies power to attached devices using a new, backward compatible, connector. On a notebook eSATAp usually supplies only 5&nbsp;V to power a 2.5-inch HDD/SSD; on a desktop workstation it can additionally supply 12&nbsp;V to power larger devices including 3.5-inch HDD/SSD and 5.25-inch optical drives.\n\neSATAp support can be added to a desktop machine in the form of a bracket connecting the motherboard SATA, power, and USB resources.\n\neSATA, like USB, supports [[hot plugging]], although this might be limited by OS drivers and device firmware.\n\n=== Thunderbolt ===\n[[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] combines [[PCI Express]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]] into a new serial data interface. Original Thunderbolt implementations have two channels, each with a transfer speed of 10&nbsp;Gbit/s, resulting in an aggregate unidirectional bandwidth of 20&nbsp;Gbit/s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/how-it-works |title=How Thunderbolt Technology Works: Thunderbolt Technology Community |publisher=Thunderbolttechnology.net |accessdate=2014-01-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210063142/https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/how-it-works |archivedate=10 February 2014  }}</ref>\n\n[[Thunderbolt 2]] uses link aggregation to combine the two 10&nbsp;Gbit/s channels into one bidirectional 20&nbsp;Gbit/s channel.\n\n[[Thunderbolt 3]] uses the [[USB-C]] connector.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/thunderbolt-3-and-usb-type-c-join-forces-for-one-port-to-rule-them-all/|title=One port to rule them all: Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 and USB Type-C join forces|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602195337/http://www.cnet.com/news/thunderbolt-3-and-usb-type-c-join-forces-for-one-port-to-rule-them-all/|archivedate=2015-06-02|url-status=live|accessdate=2015-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/06/02/thunderbolt-3-usb-c/ |title=Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 is twice as fast and uses reversible USB-C |accessdate=2015-06-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603000428/http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/02/thunderbolt-3-usb-c/ |archivedate=2015-06-03  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/06/thunderbolt-3-embraces-usb-type-c-connector-doubles-bandwidth-to-40gbps/ |title=Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 embraces USB Type-C connector, doubles bandwidth to 40&nbsp;Gbps |author=Sebastian Anthony |date=2015-06-02|website=Ars Technica |accessdate=2015-06-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609183247/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/06/thunderbolt-3-embraces-usb-type-c-connector-doubles-bandwidth-to-40gbps/ |archivedate=2015-06-09  }}</ref> Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 has two physical 20&nbsp;Gbit/s bi-directional channels, aggregated to appear as a single logical 40&nbsp;Gbit/s bi-directional channel. Thunderbolt 3 controllers can incorporate a USB&nbsp;3.1 Gen 2 controller to provide compatibility with USB devices. They are also capable of providing DisplayPort alternate mode over the USB-C connector, making a Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 port a superset of a USB&nbsp;3.1 Gen 2 port with DisplayPort alternate mode.\n\nAfter the specification was made royalty-free and custodianship of the Thunderbolt protocol was transferred from Intel to the USB Implementers' Forum, Thunderbolt 3 has been effectively implemented in the USB4 specification \u2013 with compatibility with Thunderbolt 3 optional but encouraged for USB4 products \u2014 with Thunderbolt 4 being applied to products that are compatible with USB4's complete feature set. \n\n== Interoperability ==\n{{Main|USB adapter}}\nVarious [[protocol converter]]s are available that convert USB data signals to and from other communications standards.\n\n== Security threats ==\n\n* [[BadUSB]]<ref name=BadUSB></ref>, see also [[USB flash drive#BadUSB]]\n* Intel cpus, from Skylake, allow to take control over them from USB 3.0.<ref>https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/where-theres-a-jtag-theres-a-way/</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JCUrG7ERIE</ref><ref>https://habr.com/ru/company/pt/blog/318744/</ref>\n* [[USB Killer]]\n* USB flash drives were dangerous for first versions of Windows XP because they were configured by default to execute program shown in Autorun.inf immediately after plugging flash drive in, malware could be automatically activated with usage of that.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=24em}}\n* [[DockPort]]\n* [[Easy Transfer Cable]]\n* [[Extensible Host Controller Interface]] (XHCI)\n* [[LIO Target]]\n* [[List of device bit rates#Peripheral]]\n* [[Media Transfer Protocol]]\n* [[Mobile High-Definition Link]]\n* [[WebUSB]]\n* [[USB-C]]\n* [[Thunderbolt (interface)]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist |refs=\n<ref name=\"spec_3.0\">{{cite book | url=http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/documents_archive/usb_30_spec_070113.zip | title=Universal Serial Bus 3.0 Specification | date=6 June 2011 |via=www.usb.org | publisher=[[Hewlett-Packard Company]] [[Intel Corporation]] [[Microsoft Corporation]] [[NEC Corporation]] [[ST-Ericsson]] [[Texas Instruments]] | format=[[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519092924/http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/documents_archive/usb_30_spec_070113.zip | archivedate=19 May 2014 | df=dmy-all }}<br />{{cite web |title= Universal Serial Bus 3.0 Specification | url= http://www.gaw.ru/pdf/interface/usb/USB%203%200_english.pdf |date= 2008-11-12 |accessdate= 2012-12-29 |via= www.gaw.ru | df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"usb.org 3.1\">{{cite web |title=USB 3.1 Specification{{snd}} Language Usage Guidelines from USB-IF |url=http://www.usb.org/developers/ssusb/USB_3_1_Language_Product_and_Packaging_Guidelines_FINAL.pdf |via=www.usb.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312135950/http://www.usb.org/developers/ssusb/USB_3_1_Language_Product_and_Packaging_Guidelines_FINAL.pdf |archivedate=12 March 2016  }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"xmos2015\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.epsglobal.com/downloads/XMOS/Why-do-you-need-USB-Audio-Class-2.pdf |title=Why do you need USB Audio Class 2? |last=Strong |first=Laurence |date=2015 |publisher=XMOS |quote=In applications where streaming latency is important, UAC2 offers up to an 8x reduction over UAC1. ...

It has largely replaced interfaces such as [[serial port]]s and [[parallel port]]s, and has become commonplace on a wide range of devices. Examples of peripherals that are connected via USB include computer keyboards and mice, video cameras, printers, portable media players, disk drives and network adapters.\n\nUSB connectors have been increasingly replacing other types as charging cables of portable devices.\n\n===Receptacle (socket) identification ===\n{{Main|USB hardware#Connectors}}\nThis section is intended to allow fast identification of USB receptacles (sockets) on equipment.

As such, USB devices often do not have user-adjustable interface settings.\n* The USB interface is [[Hot swapping|hot-swappable]] (devices can be exchanged without rebooting the host computer). \n* Small devices can be powered directly from the USB interface, eliminating the need for additional power supply cables.\n* Because use of the USB logo is only permitted after [[Conformance testing|compliance testing]], the user can have confidence that a USB device will work as expected without extensive interaction with settings and configuration.\n* The USB interface defines protocols for recovery from common errors, improving reliability over previous interfaces.<ref name=JA2015/> \n* Installation of a device relying on the USB standard requires minimal operator action. When a device is plugged into a port on a running personal computer system, it is either entirely automatically configured using existing [[Device driver|device drivers]], or the system prompts the user to locate a driver which is then installed and configured automatically.\n\nThe USB standard also provides multiple benefits for hardware manufacturers and software developers, specifically in the relative ease of implementation:\n* The USB standard eliminates the requirement to develop proprietary interfaces to new peripherals. \n* The wide range of transfer speeds available from a USB interface suits devices ranging from keyboards and mice up to streaming video interfaces. \n* A USB interface can be designed to provide the best available [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] for time-critical functions, or can be set up to do background transfers of bulk data with little impact on system resources. \n* The USB interface is generalized with no signal lines dedicated to only one function of one device.<ref name=JA2015/>\n\n===Limitations===\nAs with all standards, USB possesses multiple limitations to its design:\n* USB cables are limited in length, as the standard was intended for peripherals on the same table-top, not between rooms or buildings. However, a USB port can be connected to a [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] that accesses distant devices. \n* USB has a strict [[tree network]] topology and [[Master/slave (technology)|master/slave]] protocol for addressing peripheral devices; those devices cannot interact with one another except via the host, and two hosts cannot communicate over their USB ports directly. Some extension to this limitation is possible through [[USB On-The-Go]]. \n* A host cannot broadcast signals to all peripherals at once\u2014each must be addressed individually. Some very high speed peripheral devices require sustained speeds not available in the USB standard.<ref name=JA2015/> \n* While converters exist between certain [[Legacy system|legacy interfaces]] and USB, they may not provide full implementation of the legacy hardware. For example, a USB-to-parallel-port converter may work well with a printer, but not with a scanner that requires bi-directional use of the data pins.\n\nFor a product developer, use of USB requires implementation of a complex protocol and implies an \"intelligent\" controller in the peripheral device. Developers of USB devices intended for public sale generally must obtain a USB ID which requires a fee paid to the [[USB Implementers Forum]]. Developers of products that use the USB specification must sign an agreement with the Implementers Forum. Use of the USB logos on the product require annual fees and membership in the organization.<ref name=JA2015/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:USB Icon.svg|thumb|right|alt=Large circle is left end of horizontal line.

Additional [[USB hub]]s may be included, allowing up to five tiers. A USB host may have multiple controllers, each with one or more ports. Up to 127 devices may be connected to a single host controller.<ref>{{cite book | title = Universal Serial Bus Specification Revision 2.0 | pages = 13; 30; 256 | format = [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] | url = http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb_20_101111.zip | date = 11 October 2011 | accessdate = 2012-09-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120528075527/http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb_20_101111.zip | archivedate = 28 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"spec_3.0\" />{{rp|at=8\u201329}} USB devices are linked in series through hubs. The hub built into the host controller is called the ''root hub''.\n\nA USB device may consist of several logical sub-devices that are referred to as ''device functions''. A ''composite device'' may provide several functions, for example, a [[webcam]] (video device function) with a built-in microphone (audio device function). An alternative to this is a ''[[compound device]],'' in which the host assigns each logical device a distinct address and all logical devices connect to a built-in hub that connects to the physical USB cable.\n\n[[File:USB pipes and endpoints (en).svg|thumb|alt=Diagram: inside a device are several endpoints, each of which is connected by a logical pipes to a host controller. Data in each pipe flows in one direction, although there are a mixture going to and from the host controller.|USB endpoints reside on the connected device: the channels to the host are referred to as pipes]]\n\nUSB device communication is based on ''pipes'' (logical channels). A pipe is a connection from the host controller to a logical entity within a device, called an ''[[communication endpoint|endpoint]]''. Because pipes correspond to endpoints, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Each USB device can have up to 32 endpoints (16 ''in'' and 16 ''out''), though it is rare to have so many. Endpoints are defined and numbered by the device during initialization (the period after physical connection called \"enumeration\") and so are relatively permanent, whereas pipes may be opened and closed.\n\nThere are two types of pipe: stream and message.\n* A ''message'' pipe is bi-directional and is used for ''control'' transfers. Message pipes are typically used for short, simple commands to the device, and for status responses from the device, used, for example, by the bus control pipe number 0.\n* A ''stream'' pipe is a uni-directional pipe connected to a uni-directional endpoint that transfers data using an ''isochronous'',<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.usb.org/developers/presentations/SuperSpeed_USB_DevCon_Isochronous_Froelich.pdf\n |title       = Isochronous Protocol\n |date        = 2009-05-20\n |accessdate  = 2014-11-21\n |author      = Dan Froelich\n |website     = usb.org\n |format      = PDF\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140817061140/http://www.usb.org/developers/presentations/SuperSpeed_USB_DevCon_Isochronous_Froelich.pdf\n |archivedate = 17 August 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> ''interrupt'', or ''bulk'' transfer:\n*;Isochronous transfers: At some guaranteed data rate (for fixed-bandwidth streaming data) but with possible data loss (e.g., realtime audio or video)\n*;Interrupt transfers: Devices that need guaranteed quick responses (bounded latency) such as pointing devices, [[Computer mouse|mice]], and keyboards\n*;Bulk transfers: Large sporadic transfers using all remaining available bandwidth, but with no guarantees on bandwidth or latency (e.g., file transfers)\n\nWhen a host starts a data transfer, it sends a TOKEN packet containing an endpoint specified with a [[tuple]] of ''(device_address, endpoint_number)''. If the transfer is from the host to the endpoint, the host sends an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) with the desired device address and endpoint number. If the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.\n\n[[File:USB 2 and 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Rectangular opening where the width is twice the height. The opening has a metal rim, and within the opening a flat rectangular bar runs parallel to the top side.|Two USB&nbsp;3.0 Standard-A receptacles (left) and two USB&nbsp;2.0 Standard-A receptacles (right) on a computer's front panel]]\n\nEndpoints are grouped into ''interfaces'' and each interface is associated with a single device function. An exception to this is endpoint zero, which is used for device configuration and is not associated with any interface. A single device function composed of independently controlled interfaces is called a ''composite device''. A composite device only has a single device address because the host only assigns a device address to a function.\n\nWhen a USB device is first connected to a USB host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The data rate of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device's information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the device is supported by the host, the [[device driver]]s needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.\n\nThe host controller directs traffic flow to devices, so no USB device can transfer any data on the bus without an explicit request from the host controller. In USB&nbsp;2.0, the host controller [[Polling (computer science)|polls]] the bus for traffic, usually in a [[Round-robin scheduling|round-robin]] fashion. The throughput of each USB port is determined by the slower speed of either the USB port or the USB device connected to the port.\n\nHigh-speed USB&nbsp;2.0 hubs contain devices called transaction translators that convert between high-speed USB&nbsp;2.0 buses and full and low speed buses. There may be one translator per hub or per port.\n\nBecause there are two separate controllers in each USB&nbsp;3.0 host, USB&nbsp;3.0 devices transmit and receive at USB&nbsp;3.0 data rates regardless of USB&nbsp;2.0 or earlier devices connected to that host. Operating data rates for earlier devices are set in the legacy manner.\n\n== {{Anchor|PHDC}}Device classes ==\nThe functionality of a USB device is defined by a class code sent to a USB host. This allows the host to load software modules for the device and to support new devices from different manufacturers.\n\nDevice classes include:<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.usb.org/defined-class-codes | title = USB Class Codes | date = 22 September 2018 | via=www.usb.org | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180922111633/https://www.usb.org/defined-class-codes | archivedate = 22 September 2018 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

At first intended for magnetic and optical drives, it has been extended to support [[USB flash drive|flash drives]]. It has also been extended to support a wide variety of novel devices as many systems can be controlled with the familiar metaphor of file manipulation within directories. The process of making a novel device look like a familiar device is also known as extension. The ability to boot a write-locked [[SD card]] with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, pristine state of the booting medium.\n\nThough most personal computers since early 2005 can boot from USB mass storage devices, USB is not intended as a primary bus for a computer's internal storage. However, USB has the advantage of allowing [[hot-swapping]], making it useful for mobile peripherals, including drives of various kinds.\n\nSeveral manufacturers offer external portable USB [[hard disk drive]]s, or empty enclosures for disk drives. These offer performance comparable to internal drives, limited by the current number and types of attached USB devices, and by the upper limit of the USB interface. Other competing standards for external drive connectivity include [[eSATA]], [[ExpressCard]], [[FireWire]] (IEEE 1394), and most recently [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]].\n\nAnother use for USB mass storage devices is the portable execution of software applications (such as web browsers and VoIP clients) with no need to install them on the host computer.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/portable-software-usb/ | title = 100 Portable Apps for your USB Stick (both for Mac and Win) | accessdate = 2008-10-30 | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202121455/http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/portable-software-usb/ | archivedate = 2 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.VoIP-Download.com/Skype.htm#USB/ | title = Skype VoIP USB Installation Guide | accessdate = 2008-10-30 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140706153501/http://www.voip-download.com/Skype.htm#USB/ | archivedate = 6 July 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Media Transfer Protocol ===\n{{See also|Picture Transfer Protocol}}\n[[Media Transfer Protocol]] (MTP) was designed by [[Microsoft]] to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, at the level of files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]] features. MTP was designed for use with [[portable media player]]s, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol{{snd}} an evolution of MTP). The primary reason for this is that MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.\n\n=== Human interface devices ===\n{{Main |USB human interface device class}}\nJoysticks, keypads, tablets and other human-interface devices (HIDs) are also progressively{{when|date=February 2016}} migrating from MIDI, and PC [[game port]] connectors to USB.{{Citation needed |date=November 2011}}\n\nUSB mice and keyboards can usually be used with older computers that have [[PS/2 port|PS/2 connectors]] with the aid of a small USB-to-PS/2 adapter. For mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support, an adaptor that contains no [[Electronic circuit|logic circuitry]] may be used: the [[USB hardware]] in the keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a USB or PS/2 port, and communicate using the appropriate protocol. Converters also exist that connect PS/2 keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to a USB port.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.startech.com/Server-Management/KVM-Switches/PS-2-to-USB-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Adapter~PS22USB | title = PS/2 to USB Keyboard and Mouse Adapter | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141112214808/http://www.startech.com/Server-Management/KVM-Switches/PS-2-to-USB-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Adapter~PS22USB |website=StarTech.com | archivedate = 12 November 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> These devices present two HID endpoints to the system and use a [[microcontroller]] to perform bidirectional data translation between the two standards.\n\n=== {{Anchor|DFU}}Device Firmware Upgrade ===\n''Device Firmware Upgrade'' (DFU) is a vendor- and device-independent mechanism for upgrading the [[firmware]] of USB devices with improved versions provided by their manufacturers, offering (for example) a way to deploy firmware bug fixes. During the firmware upgrade operation, USB devices change their operating mode effectively becoming a [[Programmable read-only memory|PROM]] programmer.

This is one of many types of [[USB connector]].]]\nBy design, it is difficult to insert a USB plug into its receptacle incorrectly. The USB specification requires that the cable plug and receptacle be marked so the user can recognize the proper orientation.<ref name=\"spec_3.0\" /> The USB-C plug however is reversible. USB cables and small USB devices are held in place by the gripping force from the receptacle, with no screws, clips, or thumb-turns as some connectors use.\n\nThe different A and B plugs prevent accidentally connecting two power sources. However, some of this directed topology is lost with the advent of multi-purpose USB connections (such as [[USB On-The-Go]] in smartphones, and USB-powered Wi-Fi routers), which require A-to-A, B-to-B, and sometimes Y/splitter cables.\n\nUSB connector types multiplied as the specification progressed. The original USB specification detailed standard-A and standard-B plugs and receptacles. The connectors were different so that users could not connect one computer receptacle to another. The data pins in the standard plugs are recessed compared to the power pins, so that the device can power up before establishing a data connection. Some devices operate in different modes depending on whether the data connection is made.  Charging docks supply power and do not include a host device or data pins, allowing any capable USB device to charge or operate from a standard USB cable. Charging cables provide power connections, but not data. In a charge-only cable, the data wires are shorted at the device end, otherwise the device may reject the charger as unsuitable.\n\n== {{Anchor|CABLING}}Cabling ==\n[[File:Cables in Hong Kong.JPG|thumb|right|A variety of USB cables for sale in [[Hong Kong]]]]\n{{Main|USB hardware#Cabling}}  \n \nThe USB&nbsp;1.1 standard specifies that a standard cable can have a maximum length of {{convert|5|m|ftin|sp=us}} with devices operating at full speed (12&nbsp;Mbit/s), and a maximum length of {{convert|3|m|ftin|sp=us}} with devices operating at low speed (1.5&nbsp;Mbit/s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cablesplususa.com/pdf/USB_Cable_Length_Limitations.pdf |title=USB Cable Length Limitations |publisher=cablesplususa.com |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2014-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011015850/http://www.cablesplususa.com/pdf/USB_Cable_Length_Limitations.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-usb-cable |title=What is the Maximum Length of a USB Cable? |publisher=Techwalla.com |accessdate=2017-11-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043247/https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-usb-cable |archivedate=1 December 2017  }}</ref><ref name=\"faq\"/>\n\nUSB&nbsp;2.0 provides for a maximum cable length of {{convert|5|m|ftin|sp=us}} for devices running at high speed (480&nbsp;Mbit/s).<ref name=\"faq\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.usb.org/developers/usbfaq/#cab1 | title = Cables and Long-Haul Solutions | work = USB 2.0 Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = USB Implementers Forum | accessdate = 2019-04-28 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110118225750/http://www.usb.org/developers/usbfaq/#cab1 | archivedate = 18 January 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe USB&nbsp;3.0 standard does not directly specify a maximum cable length, requiring only that all cables meet an electrical specification: for copper cabling with [[American wire gauge|AWG]]&nbsp;26 wires the maximum practical length is {{convert|3|m|ftin|sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=USB 3.0 Developers FAQ |url=http://janaxelson.com/usb3faq.htm#ca_maximum |accessdate=2016-10-20 |last=Axelson |first=Jan |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220073858/http://www.janaxelson.com/usb3faq.htm#ca_maximum |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}</ref>\n\n== {{Anchor|POWER}}Power ==\n{{Main|USB hardware#Power}}\n\nUSB supplies power at 5&nbsp;V&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;5% to power USB downstream devices.\n\n=== {{Anchor|HOST}}Low-power and high-power devices ===\nLow-power devices may draw at most 1 unit load (1 unit load is 100 mA for USB devices up to USB&nbsp;2.0, while USB&nbsp;3.0 defines a unit load as 150&nbsp;mA), and all devices must act as low-power devices when starting out as unconfigured.\n\nHigh-power devices (such as a typical 2.5-inch USB hard disc drive) draw at least 1 unit load and at most 5 unit loads (5x100mA = 500&nbsp;mA) for devices up to USB&nbsp;2.0 or 6 unit loads (6x150mA= 900&nbsp;mA) for SuperSpeed (USB 3.0 and up) devices.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+ USB power standards\n|-\n!

In the initial design, USB operated at a far lower data rate and used less sophisticated hardware. It was suitable for small peripherals such as keyboards and pointing devices.\n\nThe most significant technical differences between FireWire and USB include:\n\n* USB networks use a [[star network|tiered-star]] topology, while IEEE&nbsp;1394 networks use a [[tree network|tree]] topology.\n* USB&nbsp;1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 use a \"speak-when-spoken-to\" protocol, meaning that each peripheral communicates with the host when the host specifically requests it to communicate. USB&nbsp;3.0 allows for device-initiated communications towards the host. A FireWire device can communicate with any other node at any time, subject to network conditions.\n* A USB network relies on a single host at the top of the tree to control the network. All communications are between the host and one peripheral. In a FireWire network, any capable node can control the network.\n* USB runs with a 5&nbsp;[[Volts|V]] power line, while FireWire in current implementations supplies 12&nbsp;V and theoretically can supply up to 30&nbsp;V.\n* Standard USB hub ports can provide from the typical 500&nbsp;mA/2.5&nbsp;W of current, only 100&nbsp;mA from non-hub ports. USB&nbsp;3.0 and USB On-The-Go supply 1.8&nbsp;A/9.0&nbsp;W (for dedicated battery charging, 1.5&nbsp;A/7.5&nbsp;W full bandwidth or 900&nbsp;mA/4.5&nbsp;W high bandwidth), while FireWire can in theory supply up to 60&nbsp;watts of power, although 10 to 20&nbsp;watts is more typical.\n\nThese and other differences reflect the differing design goals of the two buses: USB was designed for simplicity and low cost, while FireWire was designed for high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as audio and video. Although similar in theoretical maximum transfer rate, FireWire&nbsp;400 is faster than USB&nbsp;2.0 high-bandwidth in real-use,<ref>{{cite web|title=FireWire vs. USB 2.0|url=http://www.qimaging.com/support/pdfs/firewire_usb_technote.pdf|publisher=QImaging|accessdate=2010-07-20|format=PDF|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011050049/http://www.qimaging.com/support/pdfs/firewire_usb_technote.pdf|archivedate=11 October 2010}}</ref> especially in high-bandwidth use such as external hard drives.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cwol.com/firewire/firewire-vs-usb.htm |title= FireWire vs. USB&nbsp;2.0 \u2013 Bandwidth Tests |accessdate= 2007-08-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070812045719/http://www.cwol.com/firewire/firewire-vs-usb.htm |archivedate= 12 August 2007 |df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/usb-2-0-vs-firewire |title=USB&nbsp;2.0 vs FireWire |publisher=Pricenfees |accessdate=2007-08-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016063120/https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/usb-2-0-vs-firewire |archivedate=16 October 2016  }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,847716,00.asp |title=The Great Interface-Off: FireWire Vs.

They operate at 48&nbsp;V&nbsp;[[Direct current|DC]] and can supply more power (up to 12.95&nbsp;W for ''af'', 25.5&nbsp;W for ''at'' aka ''PoE+'', 71&nbsp;W for ''bt'' aka ''4PPoE'') over a cable up to 100&nbsp;meters compared to USB&nbsp;2.0, which provides 2.5&nbsp;W with a maximum cable length of 5&nbsp;meters. This has made PoE popular for [[VoIP]] telephones, [[security camera]]s, [[wireless access point]]s, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low.\n\n[[Ethernet]] standards require electrical isolation between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) and the network cable up to 1500&nbsp;V&nbsp;AC or 2250&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC for 60&nbsp;seconds.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.3-2008_section1.pdf | title = 802.3, Section 14.3.1.1 | format = PDF | publisher = IEEE | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101206030247/http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.3-2008_section1.pdf | archivedate = 6 December 2010 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> USB has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer, and in fact it connects the peripheral and host grounds.

However, Power over Ethernet and the [[MIDI]] plug standard have an advantage in high-end devices that may have long cables. USB can cause [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]] problems between equipment, because it connects ground references on both transceivers. By contrast, the MIDI plug standard and [[Ethernet]] have built-in isolation to {{gaps|500|V}} or more.\n\n=== eSATA/eSATAp ===\nThe [[eSATA]] connector is a more robust [[SATA]] connector, intended for connection to external hard drives and SSDs. eSATA's transfer rate (up to 6&nbsp;Gbit/s) is similar to that of USB&nbsp;3.0 (up to 5&nbsp;Gbit/s on current devices; 10&nbsp;Gbit/s speeds via USB&nbsp;3.1, announced on 31 July 2013). A device connected by eSATA appears as an ordinary SATA device, giving both full performance and full compatibility associated with internal drives.\n\neSATA does not supply power to external devices. This is an increasing disadvantage compared to USB. Even though USB&nbsp;3.0's 4.5&nbsp;W is sometimes insufficient to power external hard drives, technology is advancing and external drives gradually need less power, diminishing the eSATA advantage. [[eSATAp]] (power over eSATA; aka ESATA/USB) is a connector introduced in 2009 that supplies power to attached devices using a new, backward compatible, connector. On a notebook eSATAp usually supplies only 5&nbsp;V to power a 2.5-inch HDD/SSD; on a desktop workstation it can additionally supply 12&nbsp;V to power larger devices including 3.5-inch HDD/SSD and 5.25-inch optical drives.\n\neSATAp support can be added to a desktop machine in the form of a bracket connecting the motherboard SATA, power, and USB resources.\n\neSATA, like USB, supports [[hot plugging]], although this might be limited by OS drivers and device firmware.\n\n=== Thunderbolt ===\n[[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] combines [[PCI Express]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]] into a new serial data interface. Original Thunderbolt implementations have two channels, each with a transfer speed of 10&nbsp;Gbit/s, resulting in an aggregate unidirectional bandwidth of 20&nbsp;Gbit/s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/how-it-works |title=How Thunderbolt Technology Works: Thunderbolt Technology Community |publisher=Thunderbolttechnology.net |accessdate=2014-01-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210063142/https://thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/how-it-works |archivedate=10 February 2014  }}</ref>\n\n[[Thunderbolt 2]] uses link aggregation to combine the two 10&nbsp;Gbit/s channels into one bidirectional 20&nbsp;Gbit/s channel.\n\n[[Thunderbolt 3]] uses the [[USB-C]] connector.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/thunderbolt-3-and-usb-type-c-join-forces-for-one-port-to-rule-them-all/|title=One port to rule them all: Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 and USB Type-C join forces|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602195337/http://www.cnet.com/news/thunderbolt-3-and-usb-type-c-join-forces-for-one-port-to-rule-them-all/|archivedate=2015-06-02|url-status=live|accessdate=2015-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/06/02/thunderbolt-3-usb-c/ |title=Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 is twice as fast and uses reversible USB-C |accessdate=2015-06-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603000428/http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/02/thunderbolt-3-usb-c/ |archivedate=2015-06-03  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/06/thunderbolt-3-embraces-usb-type-c-connector-doubles-bandwidth-to-40gbps/ |title=Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 embraces USB Type-C connector, doubles bandwidth to 40&nbsp;Gbps |author=Sebastian Anthony |date=2015-06-02|website=Ars Technica |accessdate=2015-06-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609183247/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/06/thunderbolt-3-embraces-usb-type-c-connector-doubles-bandwidth-to-40gbps/ |archivedate=2015-06-09  }}</ref> Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 has two physical 20&nbsp;Gbit/s bi-directional channels, aggregated to appear as a single logical 40&nbsp;Gbit/s bi-directional channel. Thunderbolt 3 controllers can incorporate a USB&nbsp;3.1 Gen 2 controller to provide compatibility with USB devices. They are also capable of providing DisplayPort alternate mode over the USB-C connector, making a Thunderbolt&nbsp;3 port a superset of a USB&nbsp;3.1 Gen 2 port with DisplayPort alternate mode.\n\nAfter the specification was made royalty-free and custodianship of the Thunderbolt protocol was transferred from Intel to the USB Implementers' Forum, Thunderbolt 3 has been effectively implemented in the USB4 specification \u2013 with compatibility with Thunderbolt 3 optional but encouraged for USB4 products \u2014 with Thunderbolt 4 being applied to products that are compatible with USB4's complete feature set. \n\n== Interoperability ==\n{{Main|USB adapter}}\nVarious [[protocol converter]]s are available that convert USB data signals to and from other communications standards.\n\n== Security threats ==\n\n* [[BadUSB]]<ref name=BadUSB></ref>, see also [[USB flash drive#BadUSB]]\n* Intel cpus, from Skylake, allow to take control over them from USB 3.0.<ref>https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/where-theres-a-jtag-theres-a-way/</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JCUrG7ERIE</ref><ref>https://habr.com/ru/company/pt/blog/318744/</ref>\n* [[USB Killer]]\n* USB flash drives were dangerous for first versions of Windows XP because they were configured by default to execute program shown in Autorun.inf immediately after plugging flash drive in, malware could be automatically activated with usage of that.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=24em}}\n* [[DockPort]]\n* [[Easy Transfer Cable]]\n* [[Extensible Host Controller Interface]] (XHCI)\n* [[LIO Target]]\n* [[List of device bit rates#Peripheral]]\n* [[Media Transfer Protocol]]\n* [[Mobile High-Definition Link]]\n* [[WebUSB]]\n* [[USB-C]]\n* [[Thunderbolt (interface)]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist |refs=\n<ref name=\"spec_3.0\">{{cite book | url=http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/documents_archive/usb_30_spec_070113.zip | title=Universal Serial Bus 3.0 Specification | date=6 June 2011 |via=www.usb.org | publisher=[[Hewlett-Packard Company]] [[Intel Corporation]] [[Microsoft Corporation]] [[NEC Corporation]] [[ST-Ericsson]] [[Texas Instruments]] | format=[[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519092924/http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/documents_archive/usb_30_spec_070113.zip | archivedate=19 May 2014 | df=dmy-all }}<br />{{cite web |title= Universal Serial Bus 3.0 Specification | url= http://www.gaw.ru/pdf/interface/usb/USB%203%200_english.pdf |date= 2008-11-12 |accessdate= 2012-12-29 |via= www.gaw.ru | df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"usb.org 3.1\">{{cite web |title=USB 3.1 Specification{{snd}} Language Usage Guidelines from USB-IF |url=http://www.usb.org/developers/ssusb/USB_3_1_Language_Product_and_Packaging_Guidelines_FINAL.pdf |via=www.usb.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312135950/http://www.usb.org/developers/ssusb/USB_3_1_Language_Product_and_Packaging_Guidelines_FINAL.pdf |archivedate=12 March 2016  }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"xmos2015\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.epsglobal.com/downloads/XMOS/Why-do-you-need-USB-Audio-Class-2.pdf |title=Why do you need USB Audio Class 2? |last=Strong |first=Laurence |date=2015 |publisher=XMOS |quote=In applications where streaming latency is important, UAC2 offers up to an 8x reduction over UAC1. ...
