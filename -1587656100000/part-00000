His talents have been widely praised, and he openly opposes the Phantom Thieves.\n\nAs a Confidant, he represents the [[Justice (Tarot card)|Justice]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> During his Confidant, Akechi befriends Joker and admits his concerns about the Phantom Thieves' case and his past. He later joins the Thieves (with the codename \"Crow\") after learning their identities, and forces them to change Sae Nijima's heart to clear their names. In the original game, his Confidant is automatically maxed as the story progressed. In the Royal, his Confidant is optional until Rank 8 and then turns automatic following the original game. In Rank 8 that requires the player to fight him, he gives the protagonist his hand glove as a promise that they will have a rematch.\n\nAkechi works for Masayoshi Shido as the \"Black Mask\" exploiting the Metaverse. He uses his Persona to assist Shido's campaign, but secretly plans to destroy his career by revealing himself as his illegitimate son when he becomes prime minister and avenging his mother's suicide.

However, he is released at New Year and is unnerved by how he has no memory of how he managed to survive the attack by his cognitive self. It is later revealed he only escaped because Maruki uses his power to create the reality where the Joker and Akechi can start over as he knew about Joker's regret of his inability to save Akechi in Shido's palace. Unable to be content in a world where his very survival is founded on a lie and disgusted with Maruki's escapist ideology, Akechi encourages Joker to fight Maruki, even if it means losing him. He joins Joker and the Phantom Thieves once again in his Black Mask outfit while still maintaining his code name. Once Maruki is defeated, Akechi remains missing and Joker is in prison like in the original game. If the player maxed Akechi's confidant level, a man in a uniform similar to Akechi's is briefly seen in the game's true ending, but whether he survived or not is unknown. \n\nAkechi is mentioned in ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]] and [[Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight]]'' as \"Pancake-loving detective,\" and he is playable as DLC along with the soundtrack, Will Power (original version).\n\nLike Joker, Akechi is a wild card and can use several Personas simultaneously. The Persona he uses as a member of the Phantom Thieves is [[Robin Hood]]; when he faces the party in his boss battle, he switches to [[Loki]] in the second half of the fight. In Persona 5 Royal, if his Confidant is maxed and Akechi is present a day before fighting Maruki, his personas will fuse together and evolve into [[Hereward the Wake|Hereward]]. With the Phantom Thieves, Akechi fights with laser [[sabers]] and [[ray gun]]s; when he fights them after revealing his true colors, he uses serrated swords and [[pistols]] with silencers (and back to using ray guns again in ''Royal''). In ''Royal's'' the new game plus, Akechi can wear his black mask outfit in Sae's palace and his Crow outfit in Maruki's palace.

She is a first-year student that transfers to Shujin Academy around the same time as Joker. She is a [[rhythmic gymnast]] and due to her abilities the school has high hopes for her. Although she has a good relationship with Joker and his friends, her opinion towards the Phantom Thieves is quite negative, saying that their actions may lead people to heavily rely on the Phantom Thieves instead of making their own efforts to solve their problems. Despite this, she later joins them when a new Palace emerges. It is eventually revealed she is actually Kasumi's younger twin sister, {{nihongo|Sumire Yoshizawa|\u82b3\u6fa4 \u3059\u307f\u308c|Yoshizawa Sumire}} whose memories are changed via cognitive manipulation by Takuto Maruki to make her believe that she is Kasumi after the real Kasumi died pushing Sumire out of the way when she attempted to kill herself by running into traffic. Many of \"Kasumi's\" own issues, such as her klutziness and difficulty with cooking, are implied to be Sumire's subconscious awareness interfering with the implanted Persona. After his corruption, Maruki revives her true memories in a ploy to convince her, Akechi, and Joker that emotional difficulties are insurmountable without his ability to construct false memories, causing Sumire to side with him in an attempt to submerge herself in her false personality again, but she rejoins the party after accepting Kasumi's death.\n\nKasumi's Persona is Cendrillon, based on ''[[Cinderella#Cendrillon_ou_la_petite_pantoufle_de_verre,_by_Perrault|Cinderella]]''. In battle, she fights with [[rapier]]s, lever shotguns and rifles. As a Confidant, she represents the Faith Arcana. Her Confidant is split into two parts; first as Kasumi and second as Sumire. Not long after receiving scholarship to Shujin, Kasumi is instructed not to practice for a while by her coach because she's having a choreo block. She agrees to teach the protagonist her gymnastic moves in exchange she is allowed to confide to him whenever she needs it. Her Confidant will be temporarily maxed at Rank 5. During third semester, as Sumire, her Confidant continues again. After accepting her true self, Sumire resumes her practice so that she will be acknowledged as herself instead of simply being Kasumi's sister. Once her Confidant is maxed, her Persona transforms into [[Freyja|Vanadies]]. If certain conditions are met, Sumire can use her third tier Persona, Ella.\n\n===Sophia===\n:Voiced by: [[Misaki Kuno]]\n\n{{nihongo|Sophia|\u30bd\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2|Sofia}}, who assumes the codename \"Sophy\", is a character introduced in ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]''. She was first found in a box in an underground section of the Shibuya Jail by Joker after he first entered the Shibuya Jail via EMMA, a virtual assistant app, by accident. She then introduced herself as an Artificial Intelligence with her memories lost except her own name and her reason for existence, \"To be a good friend of all humans\". In the real world, she assists the Phantom Thieves as a virtual assistant such as navigation in their tour. Throughout the Phantom Thieves' adventure, she learns more about humans' emotions and began forming a bond with Joker and the rest of the Phantom Thieves. She was later revealed to be EMMA's prototype and was given her first command to be a good friend of all humans by her creator, Kuon Ichinose. However, she was deemed as a failure. Ichinose then forced a command on her to betray the Phantom Thieves. She resisted the commands after recalling her memories with the Phantom Thieves and managed to defied her creator's command and awaken her own persona to fight back. After she and the Phantom Thieves defeats Demiurge and EMMA ceased from existence, Sophia decides to accompany Ichinose on her journey, parting ways with the Phantom Thieves.\n\nSophia's persona is Pandora and represents the Star Arcana. In battle, Sophia fights with a [[Yo-yo]] and a ray gun. Outside of Jails, she resides in Joker's smartphone as she does not have a physical body.\n\n===Zenkichi Hasegawa===\n:Voiced by: [[Shin-ichiro Miki]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://p5s.jp/character/zenkichi/|title=\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc - \u9577\u8c37\u5ddd \u5584\u5409; \u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca\uff15 \u30b9\u30af\u30e9\u30f3\u30d6\u30eb\u3000\u30b6 \u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0 \u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc\u30ba \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|publisher=Atlus|accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n{{nihongo|Zenkichi Hasegawa|\u9577\u8c37\u5ddd \u5584\u5409|Hasegawa Zenkichi}}, who assumes the codename \"Wolf\", is a character introduced in ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]''. He is a police officer from the Public Security Bureau and he struck a deal with the Phantom Thieves so as to find out the mastermind behind the brainwashing events around Japan. He has a daughter, Akane, but she hated him ever since her mother, Aoi Hasegawa, passed away in a hit-and-run accident and he couldn't arrest the person responsible for his late wife's death. At first, he was content with just solving the case and would even go so far as to abandon the Phantom Thieves. However, after bonding with them during the cases, and them helping him reconcile with his daughter changed his personality somewhat towards the Phantom Thieves. He also allowed the Phantom Thieves to escape arrest when they were framed for murder in Okinawa and the hacking of the virtual assistant, EMMA, which led to him being temporarily arrested. The Phantom Thieves, through Sae Niijima, allowed him to be released from arrest and subsequently awaken his Persona when his daughter was manipulated to be a King for Kyoto's Jail. \n\nZenkichi's persona is [[Jean Valjean|Valijean]], based on the main character from Victor Hugo's novel, ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'' and represents the [[The Hierophant|Priest]] Arcana. In battle, Zenkichi fights with a greatsword and wields a dual set of revolvers.\n\n==Secondary characters==\n\n===Sae Niijima===\n:Voiced by (English): Elizabeth Maxwell<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Y\u016bko Kaida]]\n{{Nihongo4|Sae Niijima|\u65b0\u5cf6 \u51b4|Nijima Sae}} is a prosecutor for the Tokyo District Special Investigation Department and [[legal guardian]] of her sister, Makoto. Although Sae cares for Makoto and helps her succeed, she sees her sister as a burden who takes what little enjoyment is left in life after their father, a police officer, was killed in the line of duty. In her disillusionment with the Japanese judicial system, Sae develops a Palace representing [[envy]] in the form of a rigged casino where she always wins. She is assigned to the Phantom Thieves case, and becomes fixated on them.\n\nAs a Confidant, Sae represents the [[Judgment (Tarot card)|Judgment]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> During the game, she [[interrogate]]s Joker about the Phantom Thieves following his arrest. Although Sae is tasked to prosecute the Phantom Thieves, she believes Joker's story and helps him escape. When she completes her Confidant she decides to become a defense attorney, and gives Joker her business card when he leaves Shibuya.

He left the government sector to work at the caf\u00e9 shortly after her death, and suspects Masayoshi Shido's involvement. Sojiro learns that Joker and his friends are the Phantom Thieves, and lets them use Caf\u00e9 Leblanc as their headquarters.\n\nAs a Confidant, Sojiro represents the [[The Hierophant (Tarot card)|Hierophant]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> During his Confidant, he is harassed and extorted by Futaba's abusive uncle. Futaba wants to defend Sojiro, but his coolness towards her causes them to argue. The protagonist helps Sojiro and Futaba reconcile; Sojiro asks Futaba to stay with him, and thanks Joker for reminding him not to take the easy path in life. When he completes his Confidant, Sojiro gives Joker a Recipe Note: a list of recipes written by Wakaba before she died.\n\n==Antagonists==\nIn ''Persona 5'', some individuals have a severely-distorted view of the world and the people around them. At a certain level characters gain a Palace, a place in the Metaverse where their desires appear. Eight palaces must be overcome, represented by the [[seven deadly sins]]; each palace has an owner with whom the main characters interact.\n\n===Suguru Kamoshida===\n:Voiced by (English): [[D. C.

Kamoshida abuses and sexually assaults the students, which is ignored by the principal because of the volleyball team's fame and his status as a teacher. Kamoshida targets Ann as his latest sexual conquest; when she rejects his advances, he forces himself on her best friend, Shiho Suzui. Shiho's subsequent suicide attempt convinces Joker and Ryuji to change his heart. When Kamoshida is confronted by them and Mishima, he threatens to have the three of them expelled at the next school-board meeting.\n\nKamoshida's palace represents [[lust]] and takes the form of a castle, where he sees himself as the king due to his power at Shujin Academy. The male members of the volleyball team are depicted as being subjected to torturous training, and the female team members (as well as Ann) are viewed as his sex slaves. After his Shadow is defeated, his Treasure (an ornate crown) manifests as his [[Olympic medal]] in reality. After his change of heart, Kamoshida surrenders to the police and confesses his crimes. Unlike most of the game's palace-possessing antagonists, Kamoshida is not part of its overall conspiracy. He will be portrayed by [[:ja:\u9ad8\u6728\u4fca|Shun Takagi]] in ''Persona 5: The Stage''.<ref name=\"StagePlay\"/>\n\n===Ichiryusai Madarame===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Kyle Hebert]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Yukitoshi Hori]]\n{{nihongo|Ichiryusai Madarame|\u6591\u76ee \u4e00\u6d41\u658e|Madarame Ichiry\u016bsai}} is a well-known artist who secretly plagiarizes and profits from his students' work. Yusuke's mentor, he lets him live in his run-down shack as his pupil. Yusuke admires him at first as the creator of his favorite painting, ''Sayuri'', but later discovers that Madarame stole it from his mother and let her die from a seizure. Madarame then pretended that the painting was stolen from him to fraudulently sell copies of the original to private collectors. When Ann and Yusuke discover Madarame's plagiarism, he threatens to have them arrested for trespassing after his art exhibit is over (including Joker and Ryuji).\n\nMadarame's palace represents [[vanity]], and takes the form of a lavish art museum where his students are depicted as portraits on display from which he can profit from. His treasure is the original ''Sayuri'' painting, which depicts Yusuke's mother with her infant son in her arms; Madarame had painted over her son to add mystery and make his claim that he is the painter more believable. After his change of heart, he calls a press conference to admit his crimes and plagiarism. Yusuke later gives the original ''Sayuri'' to Sojiro Sakura to hang in Cafe LeBlanc. \n\n===Junya Kaneshiro===\n:Voiced by (English): Jalen K. Cassell<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Kazunari Tanaka]] (''Persona 5''), [[Takahiro Fujimoto]] (''Persona 5: The Animation'' onwards)\n{{nihongo|Junya Kaneshiro|\u91d1\u57ce \u6f64\u77e2|Kaneshiro Junya}} is a ruthless [[yakuza]] crime lord who is responsible for enlisting students from Shujin Academy to smuggle drugs in Shibuya. Makoto, tasked by the principal to investigate, allows herself to be taken by the yakuza. When the Phantom Thieves try to rescue her, Kaneshiro blackmails them into paying him {{JPY|3 million|link=yes}} in three weeks with a threat to show photographs of them at a night club to their schools.\n\nKaneshiro's palace represents [[gluttony]] and takes the form of a bank hovering above Shibuya, where people are viewed as [[automated teller machine]]s for him to drain money from. His treasure appears as large gold bars in his palace, manifesting as a golden briefcase filled with fake money. After his change of heart, Kaneshiro deletes the photographs, voids the Phantom Thieves' debt, and surrenders to the police.\n\n===Kunikazu Okumura===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Christopher Corey Smith]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hirohiko Kakegawa]]\n{{nihongo|Kunikazu Okumura|\u5965\u6751 \u90a6\u548c|Okumura Kunikazu}} is [[President (corporate title)|president]] of Okumura Foods and [[list of Persona 5 characters#Haru Okumura|Haru Okumura's]] father. Growing up poor, Okumura transformed his family's small company into a multi-million-yen business and founded the popular Big Bang Burger fast-food chain. Because he mistreats his staff, he is the most popular suggested target on the Phantom Thieves' online poll.\n\nOkumura was part of Masayoshi Shido's circle as a sponsor until he decided to enter the political world. One of his first steps in gaining a foothold in politics is arranging a marriage between Haru and Sugimura (despite his abusive nature), who is from a politically-influential family. When Shido discovers this, he begins to see Okumura as a threat and orders him killed before the election. The conspiracy rigs the Phantom Thieves' poll to [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] and frame them for Okumura's murder. His Shadow is killed by Goro Akechi after the Phantom Thieves defeat him, resulting in him suffering a mental shutdown during a live conference before he can reveal the names of those linked to Shido.\n\nOkumura's palace represents [[greed]], and is depicted as a space station where his employees are robots that work in poor conditions and are discarded when they break down. His treasure is a mysterious orb in his palace, and manifests as a spaceship model kit he had dreamed of as a child but could not afford due to his family's poverty.\n\n===Masayoshi Shido===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Keith Silverstein]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Shuichi Ikeda]]\n{{nihongo|Masayoshi Shido|\u7345\u7ae5 \u6b63\u7fa9|Shid\u014d Masayoshi}} is a politician and a representative in Japan's [[National Diet]]. Early in the game, Shido frames Joker after he tries to prevent Shido from sexually assaulting his subordinate. He later appears as a candidate for prime minister, leading the United Future Party. To secure victory, he and his followers (including his illegitimate son, Akechi), steal Wakaba's research on \"cognitive psience,\" and use the Metaverse to cause mental shutdowns and psychotic breakdowns to eliminate potential threats and spread distrust for the current government administration. When the Phantom Thieves gain traction, he and his followers frame them for their crimes and use them to gain control of Japan.\n\nShido's palace represents [[pride]] and takes the form of a cruise ship sailing though a sunken Tokyo, where he and his conspirators live in luxury; rather than cognitive beings, the Shadows selves of Shido's conspirators also reside within the palace, having been drawn to his strong personality and ego. His treasure is a golden ship's wheel in his palace, manifesting as his legislative pin. After Shido's change of heart, he confesses his crimes in a press conference after his landslide victory. He is arrested at the end of the game, and Joker testifies against him at his trial.\n\n===Yaldabaoth===\n[[Yaldabaoth]], the god of control, is malevolent and appears in the form of the [[Holy Grail]]: a treasure of mementos created from humanity's distorted sloth. He leads the conspiracy to give Masayoshi Shido political power and sponsored the Phantom Thieves to see which is stronger: their salvation of the world or Goro Akechi's desire to destroy (and recreate) it. Yaldabaoth imprisons Igor, impersonating him until Joker unmasks his identity.\n\nHe reveals himself as power-hungry, self-righteous and sadistic, with a tendency to toy with humanity. When [[list of Persona 5 characters#Goro Akechi|Akechi]] and Shido are defeated, Yaldabaoth decides that the world should be saved; this \"salvation\" entails taking control of existence and removing everyone with chaos in their heart. He awakens his body in the core of mementos, merging them with the physical world as his palace. This gives Yaldabaoth the ability to change lies into truth, driving people into despair and complacency and erasing his enemies.\n\nHe is described as the manifestation of humanity's desire for order, warped to the point where he no longer cares for the human cost (or morality) of that order. Yaldabaoth sees humans as little more than livestock and [[lemmings]] for him to rule, due to their self-destructiveness and stupidity. He initially takes the form of the Holy Grail, which is black before the flow of wishes for him to dominate the world revitalizes him and turns the chalice gold. After the flow is cut off and the Grail is defeated, the chalice merges with his arena to become a giant, robotic, faceless angel who can manifest a gun, bell, sword, and book with each of his four arms. At the end of his fight it is revealed that he had enough power to defeat the Phantom Thieves at will, but kept fighting them out of arrogance. Until one of Phantom Thieves' allies Y\u016bki Mishima manages to convince the surviving civilians to support their fight against the evil god, leading the creation protagonist's ultimate Persona, Satanael. Yaldabaoth is finally defeated and reverts to his original, mindless form of the Holy Grail, bringing an end to his ambitions and destroying Mementos for good. \n\n==Confidants==\nLike previous ''Persona'' titles, progression of the characters' skills is based on their level of bonding with [[non-player character]]s.

They fuse into {{nihongo|Lavenza|\u30e9\u30f4\u30a7\u30f3\u30c4\u30a1|Ravensha}} their true form. Lavenza calls Joker \"trickster\" instead of \"inmate\" and maintain's Justine's calm demeanor, but exhibits Caroline's aggression and impatience when Ryuji cannot understand her explanations.

Before Joker leaves Tokyo, Takemi gives him a dog tag as a farewell gift.\n\n===Munehisa Iwai===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Kaiji Tang]]<br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hisao Egawa]]\n{{nihongo|Munehisa Iwai|\u5ca9\u4e95 \u5b97\u4e45|Iwai Munehisa}} is a former [[yakuza]] who owns an [[airsoft]] shop, Untouchable, in Shibuya. In the Metaverse, fake guns (and other weapons) work as well as the real thing, so Joker frequently visits Untouchable to supply the Phantom Thieves with equipment. Iwai has an adopted son, Kaoru, whose mother abandoned him when she could not sell him for drug money; unable to bring himself to tell Kaoru about his ties to the yakuza, Iwai instead told him that he was a family friend who took him in after his parents died in a car accident.\n\nIwai represents the [[The Hanged Man (Tarot card)|Hanged Man]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> In his Confidant, Joker is a lookout for Iwai and helps him with a deal involving his yakuza brother Tsuda (who has been forcing him to illegally customize guns). The deal becomes fraught when Tsuda threatens the lives of Iwai and the Phantom Thieves. He repents, however, admitting that he thought he was losing his place in the organization to younger members. Another yakuza, Masa, tries to take advantage of Tsuda's abandoning the deal; he threatens to kill Kaoru and reveals the truth regarding his parents. Iwai acknowledges Kaoru as his son, and Tsuda takes Masa into custody. At the end of the Confidant, Iwai gains Kaoru's trust and gives Joker a Gekko pin symbolizing protection of home and family before he leaves Tokyo.\n\n===Yuuki Mishima===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Sean Chiplock]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Daisuke Sakaguchi]]<ref name=\"mishima jpn\"/>\n{{nihongo|Yuuki Mishima|\u4e09\u5cf6 \u7531\u8f1d|Mishima Y\u016bki}}<ref name=\"mishima jpn\">{{cite web |url=http://persona5.jp/school_life/coop_mishima.html | title=\u4e09\u5cf6\u7531\u8f1d P\uff15 \u2013 \u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca\uff15 \u2013 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 | language=Japanese | publisher=Atlus | accessdate=December 9, 2017 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503225029/http://persona5.jp/school_life/coop_mishima.html | archivedate=May 3, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> is a classmate of Joker and Ann. A member of the volleyball club, he is a frequent target of Kamoshida's abuse. Mishima was forced to summon Shiho Suzui to Kamoshida's office, leading to a sexual assault and Shiho's suicide attempt; Kamoshida nearly expels him for confronting him with Joker and Ryuji. After Kamoshida's arrest, he realizes that Joker, Ryuji, and Ann are the Phantom Thieves. He creates and manages the Phantom Aficionados website, a fan site dedicated to the Thieves with a message board where people post requests for changes of heart. Mishima periodically sends the requests to Joker to enhance the Thieves' reputation.\n\nAs a Confidant, Mishima represents the [[The Moon (Tarot card)|Moon]] Arcana<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> and will give party members experience points. His fascination with the Phantom Thieves becomes an obsession, and Joker deduces that his motivation to help springs from insecurity and his desire for popularity. When Mishima runs into his bully from middle school, he threatens to have his heart changed. After Joker confronts his Shadow in Mementos, Mishima realizes the error of his ways and saves his bully from thugs. In gratitude, he gives Joker an early draft for a documentary he intends to make regarding the Phantom Thieves before Joker he leaves Tokyo. He will be portrayed by Taishu Nukanobu in ''Persona 5: The Stage''.<ref name=\"StagePlay\"/>\n\n===Sadayo Kawakami===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Michelle Ruff]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Mai Fuchigami]]<ref name=\"kawakami jpn\"/><ref name=\"ChallengeDesigned\"/>\n{{nihongo|Sadayo Kawakami|\u5ddd\u4e0a \u8c9e\u4ee3|Kawakami Sadayo}}<ref name=\"kawakami jpn\">{{cite web |url=http://persona5.jp/school_life/coop_kawakami.html | title=\u5ddd\u4e0a\u8c9e\u4ee3 P\uff15 \u2013 \u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca\uff15 \u2013 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 | language=Japanese | publisher=Atlus | accessdate=December 9, 2017 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806211921/http://persona5.jp/school_life/coop_kawakami.html | archivedate=August 6, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> is Class 2-D's Japanese-language and homeroom teacher (Joker and Ann's class). Kawakami avoids Joker until he learns that she is also a maid to pay the guardians of Taiki Takase, a student from the previous school she worked at. Takase worked several part-time jobs to support his guardians' hedonistic lifestyle, frequently missing school and receiving low grades. When Kawakami began to tutor him, she was ordered by the principal to stop or resign because of Takase's rumored delinquency. Takase was killed in a car accident shortly afterwards, and his guardians use his death to extort money from Kawakami, threatening to sue her if she does not comply.\n\nAs a Confidant, Kawakami represents the [[Temperance (Tarot card)|Temperance]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\"/> She helps Joker with chores and gives him free time in class. Initially saying that it pays her sister's medical bills, Kawakami's second job allows her no time to rest and she is hospitalized with exhaustion. When Joker changes the hearts of Takase's guardians, she quits her second job and resolves to be a better teacher. Upon completing her Confidant, Kawakami gives Joker a coupon for free maid service before he leaves Tokyo. If she is in a relationship with him, she gives him a pen case for Christmas.\n\n===Toranosuke Yoshida===\n:Voiced by (English): [[William Salyers]]<br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Keiichi Noda]]\n{{nihongo|Toranosuke Yoshida|\u5409\u7530 \u5bc5\u4e4b\u52a9|Yoshida Toranosuke}} is a politician and public speaker. He attempts to overcome a bad name (where he is nicknamed \"No Good Tora\") after a political scandal for which he was not responsible.\n\nYoshida represents the [[The Sun (Tarot card)|sun]] Arcana<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> in his Confidant. The player can volunteer to aid his public speaking to build up his Confidant, during which it is learned that the scandal which destroyed his credibility was not his fault; his old mentor misappropriated funds and blamed Yoshida. By the end of the Confidant, Yoshida has won a sizable base for his upcoming campaign; the culprit behind the scandal is revealed, allowing him to confront his problems. On completion of his Confidant, Yoshida gives Joker a fountain pen.\n\n===Ichiko Ohya===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Amanda Winn-Lee]]<br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Yumi Uchiyama]]\n{{nihongo|Ichiko Ohya|\u5927\u5b85 \u4e00\u5b50|\u014cya Ichiko}} is a reporter and [[Paparazzi|paparazza]] who represents the [[The Devil (Tarot card)|Devil]] Arcana<ref name=\"Arcana\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2017/04/04/persona-5-confidant-guide-devil-ichiko-ohya/252846/ | title=Persona 5 Confidant Guide \u2013 Devil Ichiko Ohya | publisher=Hardcore Gamer | accessdate=November 17, 2017 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117182454/http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2017/04/04/persona-5-confidant-guide-devil-ichiko-ohya/252846/ | archivedate=November 17, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> in her Confidant.

She scams Joker out of \u00a5100,000 to buy a power stone, which turns out to be rock salt. When he confronts her and changes the heart of someone who is bothering one of her clients, she has him accompany her during her readings because she believes that he can change fate. Her employers (the Assembly of Divine Power, a group of New Age con artists) force her to sell fake power stones; she persists, since her readings say that she cannot escape. The protagonist convinces her that the future can be changed, and her destiny is molded by her actions.\n\nUpon completing her Confidant, Chihaya gives Joker her fortune tarot card when he leaves Tokyo.

Despite his popularity at the arcade, he is swept up in a prank war with his classmates and vows to win (an aggressive trait learned from his mother, Hanae). When his classmates accuse him of bullying, he questions himself and becomes concerned when he realizes that his mother has become more unreasonable, arguing with his school concerning his education. After Hanae sees Shinya hanging out with Joker, she accuses the latter of being a bad influence to her son and threatens to report him to the police.

He is a new counselor that arrives at Shujin Academy after the arrest of Kamoshida. The students seem to really like him, as he is able to listen to them and give them good advice. Contrary to Kasumi, his opinion towards the Phantom Thieves is very positive, as he thinks their actions can bring happiness and justice to people. It is eventually revealed he is a Persona user with the ability to alter the cognitions of others, altering their personalities and memories, which he uses for truly desperate cases as a stopgap to real treatment, and a peer of Wakaba's whose research was also stolen by Shido. During the conflict with Yaldabaoth, his despair at realizing how uncaring Shujin is towards its students causes him to become vulnerable to Yaldabaoth's own ability to warp cognition, causing part of his Persona [[Adam Kadmon]] to lose a component of itself as a Treasure, causing it to degenerate into [[Azathoth]] and he enters a delusional state where he believes the only way to improve the world is to use his abilities on everyone to create a utopia, becoming the final antagonist of ''Royal''. In the bad/neutral ending, Maruki takes a photo of the phantom thieves during the graduation and leaves the gang as he created a reality that people can have happiness in their lives. In the true ending, Maruki becomes a taxi driver and offers Joker a ride as he is being followed by officers. Maruki tells Joker that he will move forward in his life as well, just like how Joker and his friends will do the same.\n\n==Reception==\nThe game's characters were generally well-received.

Futaba is bounced among abusive family members until Sojiro intervenes and takes her in. She has [[auditory hallucination]]s of her extended family's reactions to the suicide note, and locks herself in her bedroom. Futaba appears withdrawn in the game, and has developed a Palace depicting her [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]] in the form of a pyramid.

His talents have been widely praised, and he openly opposes the Phantom Thieves.\n\nAs a Confidant, he represents the [[Justice (Tarot card)|Justice]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> During his Confidant, Akechi befriends Joker and admits his concerns about the Phantom Thieves' case and his past. He later joins the Thieves (with the codename \"Crow\") after learning their identities, and forces them to change Sae Nijima's heart to clear their names. In the original game, his Confidant is automatically maxed as the story progressed. In the Royal, his Confidant is optional until Rank 8 and then turns automatic following the original game. In Rank 8 that requires the player to fight him, he gives the protagonist his hand glove as a promise that they will have a rematch.\n\nAkechi works for Masayoshi Shido as the \"Black Mask\" exploiting the Metaverse. He uses his Persona to assist Shido's campaign, but secretly plans to destroy his career by revealing himself as his illegitimate son when he becomes prime minister and avenging his mother's suicide. Akechi was forced to live in a series of abusive foster homes, and he is deeply contemptuous of society as a result. Because the Phantom Thieves are actively working against Shido, Akechi betrays them and also attempts to assassinate Joker, partly out of jealousy.<ref name=\"jealous\">{{cite video game |title=Persona 5 |developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]] |date=April 4, 2017 |platform=[[PlayStation 4]] |level=Shido's Palace |quote='''Akechi:''' But you... you're just some criminal trash living in an attic!

However, he is released at New Year and is unnerved by how he has no memory of how he managed to survive the attack by his cognitive self. It is later revealed he only escaped because Maruki uses his power to create the reality where the Joker and Akechi can start over as he knew about Joker's regret of his inability to save Akechi in Shido's palace. Unable to be content in a world where his very survival is founded on a lie and disgusted with Maruki's escapist ideology, Akechi encourages Joker to fight Maruki, even if it means losing him. He joins Joker and the Phantom Thieves once again in his Black Mask outfit while still maintaining his code name. Once Maruki is defeated, Akechi remains missing and Joker is in prison like in the original game. If the player maxed Akechi's confidant level, a man in a uniform similar to Akechi's is briefly seen in the game's true ending, but whether he survived or not is unknown. \n\nAkechi is mentioned in ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]] and [[Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight]]'' as \"Pancake-loving detective,\" and he is playable as DLC along with the soundtrack, Will Power (original version).\n\nLike Joker, Akechi is a wild card and can use several Personas simultaneously. The Persona he uses as a member of the Phantom Thieves is [[Robin Hood]]; when he faces the party in his boss battle, he switches to [[Loki]] in the second half of the fight. In Persona 5 Royal, if his Confidant is maxed and Akechi is present a day before fighting Maruki, his personas will fuse together and evolve into [[Hereward the Wake|Hereward]]. With the Phantom Thieves, Akechi fights with laser [[sabers]] and [[ray gun]]s; when he fights them after revealing his true colors, he uses serrated swords and [[pistols]] with silencers (and back to using ray guns again in ''Royal''). In ''Royal's'' the new game plus, Akechi can wear his black mask outfit in Sae's palace and his Crow outfit in Maruki's palace.

Although she has a good relationship with Joker and his friends, her opinion towards the Phantom Thieves is quite negative, saying that their actions may lead people to heavily rely on the Phantom Thieves instead of making their own efforts to solve their problems. Despite this, she later joins them when a new Palace emerges. It is eventually revealed she is actually Kasumi's younger twin sister, {{nihongo|Sumire Yoshizawa|\u82b3\u6fa4 \u3059\u307f\u308c|Yoshizawa Sumire}} whose memories are changed via cognitive manipulation by Takuto Maruki to make her believe that she is Kasumi after the real Kasumi died pushing Sumire out of the way when she attempted to kill herself by running into traffic. Many of \"Kasumi's\" own issues, such as her klutziness and difficulty with cooking, are implied to be Sumire's subconscious awareness interfering with the implanted persona. After his corruption, Maruki revives her true memories in a ploy to convince her, Akechi, and Joker that emotional difficulties are insurmountable without his ability to construct false memories, causing Sumire to side with him in an attempt to submerge herself in her false personality again, but she rejoins the party after accepting Kasumi's death.\n\nKasumi's persona is Cendrillon, based on ''[[Cinderella#Cendrillon_ou_la_petite_pantoufle_de_verre,_by_Perrault|Cinderella]]''. In battle, she fights with [[rapier]]s, lever shotguns and rifles. As a Confidant, she represents the Faith Arcana. Her Confidant is split into two parts; first as Kasumi and second as Sumire. Not long after receiving scholarship to Shujin, Kasumi is instructed not to practice for a while by her coach because she's having a choreo block. She agrees to teach the protagonist her gymnastic moves in exchange she is allowed to confide to him whenever she needs it. Her Confidant will be temporarily maxed at Rank 5. During third semester, as Sumire, her Confidant continues again. After accepting her true self, Sumire resumes her practice so that she will be acknowledged as herself instead of simply being Kasumi's sister.

She then introduced herself as an Artificial Intelligence with her memories lost except her own name and her reason for existence, \"To be a good friend of all humans\". In the real world, she assists the Phantom Thieves as a virtual assistant such as navigation in their tour. Throughout the Phantom Thieves' adventure, she learns more about humans' emotions and began forming a bond with Joker and the rest of the Phantom Thieves. She was later revealed to be EMMA's prototype and was given her first command to be a good friend of all humans by her creator, Kuon Ichinose. However, she was deemed as a failure. Ichinose then forced a command on her to betray the Phantom Thieves. She resisted the commands after recalling her memories with the Phantom Thieves and managed to defied her creator's command and awaken her own persona to fight back. After she and the Phantom Thieves defeats Demiurge and EMMA ceased from existence, Sophia decides to accompany Ichinose on her journey, parting ways with the Phantom Thieves.\n\nSophia's persona is Pandora and represents the Star Arcana.

At first, he was content with just solving the case and would even go so far as to abandon the Phantom Thieves. However, after bonding with them during the cases, and them helping him reconcile with his daughter changed his personality somewhat towards the Phantom Thieves. He also allowed the Phantom Thieves to escape arrest when they were framed for murder in Okinawa and the hacking of the virtual assistant, EMMA, which led to him being temporarily arrested.

He left the government sector to work at the caf\u00e9 shortly after her death, and suspects Masayoshi Shido's involvement. Sojiro learns that Joker and his friends are the Phantom Thieves, and lets them use Caf\u00e9 Leblanc as their headquarters.\n\nAs a Confidant, Sojiro represents the [[The Hierophant (Tarot card)|Hierophant]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> During his Confidant, he is harassed and extorted by Futaba's abusive uncle. Futaba wants to defend Sojiro, but his coolness towards her causes them to argue. The protagonist helps Sojiro and Futaba reconcile; Sojiro asks Futaba to stay with him, and thanks Joker for reminding him not to take the easy path in life. When he completes his Confidant, Sojiro gives Joker a Recipe Note: a list of recipes written by Wakaba before she died.\n\n==Antagonists==\nIn ''Persona 5'', some individuals have a severely-distorted view of the world and the people around them. At a certain level characters gain a Palace, a place in the Metaverse where their desires appear. Eight palaces must be overcome, represented by the [[seven deadly sins]]; each palace has an owner with whom the main characters interact.\n\n===Suguru Kamoshida===\n:Voiced by (English): [[D. C. Douglas]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Yuji Mitsuya]]\n{{nihongo|Suguru Kamoshida|\u9d28\u5fd7\u7530 \u5353|Kamoshida Suguru}} is Shujin Academy's PE teacher and volleyball coach, a former [[professional athlete]] and [[Olympics|Olympic volleyball champion]]. Kamoshida abuses and sexually assaults the students, which is ignored by the principal because of the volleyball team's fame and his status as a teacher. Kamoshida targets Ann as his latest sexual conquest; when she rejects his advances, he forces himself on her best friend, Shiho Suzui. Shiho's subsequent suicide attempt convinces Joker and Ryuji to change his heart. When Kamoshida is confronted by them and Mishima, he threatens to have the three of them expelled at the next school-board meeting.\n\nKamoshida's palace represents [[lust]] and takes the form of a castle, where he sees himself as the king due to his power at Shujin Academy. The male members of the volleyball team are depicted as being subjected to torturous training, and the female team members (as well as Ann) are viewed as his sex slaves. After his Shadow is defeated, his Treasure (an ornate crown) manifests as his [[Olympic medal]] in reality. After his change of heart, Kamoshida surrenders to the police and confesses his crimes. Unlike most of the game's palace-possessing antagonists, Kamoshida is not part of its overall conspiracy. He will be portrayed by [[:ja:\u9ad8\u6728\u4fca|Shun Takagi]] in ''Persona 5: The Stage''.<ref name=\"StagePlay\"/>\n\n===Ichiryusai Madarame===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Kyle Hebert]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Yukitoshi Hori]]\n{{nihongo|Ichiryusai Madarame|\u6591\u76ee \u4e00\u6d41\u658e|Madarame Ichiry\u016bsai}} is a well-known artist who secretly plagiarizes and profits from his students' work. Yusuke's mentor, he lets him live in his run-down shack as his pupil. Yusuke admires him at first as the creator of his favorite painting, ''Sayuri'', but later discovers that Madarame stole it from his mother and let her die from a seizure. Madarame then pretended that the painting was stolen from him to fraudulently sell copies of the original to private collectors. When Ann and Yusuke discover Madarame's plagiarism, he threatens to have them arrested for trespassing after his art exhibit is over (including Joker and Ryuji).\n\nMadarame's palace represents [[vanity]], and takes the form of a lavish art museum where his students are depicted as portraits on display from which he can profit from. His treasure is the original ''Sayuri'' painting, which depicts Yusuke's mother with her infant son in her arms; Madarame had painted over her son to add mystery and make his claim that he is the painter more believable. After his change of heart, he calls a press conference to admit his crimes and plagiarism. Yusuke later gives the original ''Sayuri'' to Sojiro Sakura to hang in Cafe LeBlanc. \n\n===Junya Kaneshiro===\n:Voiced by (English): Jalen K. Cassell<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Kazunari Tanaka]] (''Persona 5''), [[Takahiro Fujimoto]] (''Persona 5: The Animation'' onwards)\n{{nihongo|Junya Kaneshiro|\u91d1\u57ce \u6f64\u77e2|Kaneshiro Junya}} is a ruthless [[yakuza]] crime lord who is responsible for enlisting students from Shujin Academy to smuggle drugs in Shibuya. Makoto, tasked by the principal to investigate, allows herself to be taken by the yakuza. When the Phantom Thieves try to rescue her, Kaneshiro blackmails them into paying him {{JPY|3 million|link=yes}} in three weeks with a threat to show photographs of them at a night club to their schools.\n\nKaneshiro's palace represents [[gluttony]] and takes the form of a bank hovering above Shibuya, where people are viewed as [[automated teller machine]]s for him to drain money from. His treasure appears as large gold bars in his palace, manifesting as a golden briefcase filled with fake money. After his change of heart, Kaneshiro deletes the photographs, voids the Phantom Thieves' debt, and surrenders to the police.\n\n===Kunikazu Okumura===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Christopher Corey Smith]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hirohiko Kakegawa]]\n{{nihongo|Kunikazu Okumura|\u5965\u6751 \u90a6\u548c|Okumura Kunikazu}} is [[President (corporate title)|president]] of Okumura Foods and [[list of Persona 5 characters#Haru Okumura|Haru Okumura's]] father. Growing up poor, Okumura transformed his family's small company into a multi-million-yen business and founded the popular Big Bang Burger fast-food chain. Because he mistreats his staff, he is the most popular suggested target on the Phantom Thieves' online poll.\n\nOkumura was part of Masayoshi Shido's circle as a sponsor until he decided to enter the political world. One of his first steps in gaining a foothold in politics is arranging a marriage between Haru and Sugimura (despite his abusive nature), who is from a politically-influential family. When Shido discovers this, he begins to see Okumura as a threat and orders him killed before the election. The conspiracy rigs the Phantom Thieves' poll to [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] and frame them for Okumura's murder. His Shadow is killed by Goro Akechi after the Phantom Thieves defeat him, resulting in him suffering a mental shutdown during a live conference before he can reveal the names of those linked to Shido.\n\nOkumura's palace represents [[greed]], and is depicted as a space station where his employees are robots that work in poor conditions and are discarded when they break down. His treasure is a mysterious orb in his palace, and manifests as a spaceship model kit he had dreamed of as a child but could not afford due to his family's poverty.\n\n===Masayoshi Shido===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Keith Silverstein]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Shuichi Ikeda]]\n{{nihongo|Masayoshi Shido|\u7345\u7ae5 \u6b63\u7fa9|Shid\u014d Masayoshi}} is a politician and a representative in Japan's [[National Diet]]. Early in the game, Shido frames Joker after he tries to prevent Shido from sexually assaulting his subordinate. He later appears as a candidate for prime minister, leading the United Future Party. To secure victory, he and his followers (including his illegitimate son, Akechi), steal Wakaba's research on \"cognitive psience,\" and use the Metaverse to cause mental shutdowns and psychotic breakdowns to eliminate potential threats and spread distrust for the current government administration. When the Phantom Thieves gain traction, he and his followers frame them for their crimes and use them to gain control of Japan.\n\nShido's palace represents [[pride]] and takes the form of a cruise ship sailing though a sunken Tokyo, where he and his conspirators live in luxury; rather than cognitive beings, the Shadows selves of Shido's conspirators also reside within the palace, having been drawn to his strong personality and ego. His treasure is a golden ship's wheel in his palace, manifesting as his legislative pin. After Shido's change of heart, he confesses his crimes in a press conference after his landslide victory. He is arrested at the end of the game, and Joker testifies against him at his trial.\n\n===Yaldabaoth===\n[[Yaldabaoth]], the god of control, is malevolent and appears in the form of the [[Holy Grail]]: a treasure of mementos created from humanity's distorted sloth. He leads the conspiracy to give Masayoshi Shido political power and sponsored the Phantom Thieves to see which is stronger: their salvation of the world or Goro Akechi's desire to destroy (and recreate) it. Yaldabaoth imprisons Igor, impersonating him until Joker unmasks his identity.\n\nHe reveals himself as power-hungry, self-righteous and sadistic, with a tendency to toy with humanity. When [[list of Persona 5 characters#Goro Akechi|Akechi]] and Shido are defeated, Yaldabaoth decides that the world should be saved; this \"salvation\" entails taking control of existence and removing everyone with chaos in their heart. He awakens his body in the core of mementos, merging them with the physical world as his palace. This gives Yaldabaoth the ability to change lies into truth, driving people into despair and complacency and erasing his enemies.\n\nHe is described as the manifestation of humanity's desire for order, warped to the point where he no longer cares for the human cost (or morality) of that order. Yaldabaoth sees humans as little more than livestock and [[lemmings]] for him to rule, due to their self-destructiveness and stupidity. He initially takes the form of the Holy Grail, which is black before the flow of wishes for him to dominate the world revitalizes him and turns the chalice gold. After the flow is cut off and the Grail is defeated, the chalice merges with his arena to become a giant, robotic, faceless angel who can manifest a gun, bell, sword, and book with each of his four arms. At the end of his fight it is revealed that he had enough power to defeat the Phantom Thieves at will, but kept fighting them out of arrogance. Until one of Phantom Thieves' allies Y\u016bki Mishima manages to convince the surviving civilians to support their fight against the evil god, leading the creation protagonist's ultimate Persona, Satanael. Yaldabaoth is finally defeated and reverts to his original, mindless form of the Holy Grail, bringing an end to his ambitions and destroying Mementos for good. \n\n==Confidants==\nLike previous ''Persona'' titles, progression of the characters' skills is based on their level of bonding with [[non-player character]]s.

Justine plays the \"good cop\" and manages the Persona Compendium, a list of the Personas Joker has owned. Calmer than Caroline, she still treats Joker as a prisoner and guards the Velvet Room entrances in Mementos.\n\nCaroline and Justine represent the [[Strength (Tarot card)|Strength]] Arcana,<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> and encourage Joker to fuse certain personas with skills. When he fails to stop the Holy Grail, they remember that Yaldabaoth had captured Igor and split the pair to prevent them from acting. They fuse into {{nihongo|Lavenza|\u30e9\u30f4\u30a7\u30f3\u30c4\u30a1|Ravensha}} their true form. Lavenza calls Joker \"trickster\" instead of \"inmate\" and maintain's Justine's calm demeanor, but exhibits Caroline's aggression and impatience when Ryuji cannot understand her explanations. If the player completes Caroline and Justine's confidant, Lavenza gives Joker the key to the Velvet Room before he leaves Tokyo.\n\n===Igor===\n:Voiced by (English): [[David Lodge (voice actor)|David Lodge]] (False Igor)<br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Masane Tsukayama]] (False Igor), [[Isamu Tanonaka]] (Real Igor)<ref name=\"velvet jpn\"/>\n{{nihongo|Igor|\u30a4\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb|Ig\u014dru}} is the prison master of the Velvet Room.

As Joker participates in more of her trials, he learns that Takemi had worked for a university and was fired (and blamed) for a disastrous medical trial she had opposed. She becomes more motivated after treating a young patient with a similar illness; when Joker changes the heart of her former colleague, she saves a former patient's life and regains her reputation. Before Joker leaves Tokyo, Takemi gives him a dog tag as a farewell gift.\n\n===Munehisa Iwai===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Kaiji Tang]]<br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hisao Egawa]]\n{{nihongo|Munehisa Iwai|\u5ca9\u4e95 \u5b97\u4e45|Iwai Munehisa}} is a former [[yakuza]] who owns an [[airsoft]] shop, Untouchable, in Shibuya. In the Metaverse, fake guns (and other weapons) work as well as the real thing, so Joker frequently visits Untouchable to supply the Phantom Thieves with equipment. Iwai has an adopted son, Kaoru, whose mother abandoned him when she could not sell him for drug money; unable to bring himself to tell Kaoru about his ties to the yakuza, Iwai instead told him that he was a family friend who took him in after his parents died in a car accident.\n\nIwai represents the [[The Hanged Man (Tarot card)|Hanged Man]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> In his Confidant, Joker is a lookout for Iwai and helps him with a deal involving his yakuza brother Tsuda (who has been forcing him to illegally customize guns). The deal becomes fraught when Tsuda threatens the lives of Iwai and the Phantom Thieves. He repents, however, admitting that he thought he was losing his place in the organization to younger members. Another yakuza, Masa, tries to take advantage of Tsuda's abandoning the deal; he threatens to kill Kaoru and reveals the truth regarding his parents. Iwai acknowledges Kaoru as his son, and Tsuda takes Masa into custody. At the end of the Confidant, Iwai gains Kaoru's trust and gives Joker a Gekko pin symbolizing protection of home and family before he leaves Tokyo.\n\n===Yuuki Mishima===\n:Voiced by (English): [[Sean Chiplock]]<ref name=\"EnglishCastList\" /><br>Voiced by (Japanese): [[Daisuke Sakaguchi]]<ref name=\"mishima jpn\"/>\n{{nihongo|Yuuki Mishima|\u4e09\u5cf6 \u7531\u8f1d|Mishima Y\u016bki}}<ref name=\"mishima jpn\">{{cite web |url=http://persona5.jp/school_life/coop_mishima.html | title=\u4e09\u5cf6\u7531\u8f1d P\uff15 \u2013 \u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca\uff15 \u2013 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 | language=Japanese | publisher=Atlus | accessdate=December 9, 2017 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503225029/http://persona5.jp/school_life/coop_mishima.html | archivedate=May 3, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> is a classmate of Joker and Ann. A member of the volleyball club, he is a frequent target of Kamoshida's abuse.

After Kamoshida's arrest, he realizes that Joker, Ryuji, and Ann are the Phantom Thieves. He creates and manages the Phantom Aficionados website, a fan site dedicated to the Thieves with a message board where people post requests for changes of heart. Mishima periodically sends the requests to Joker to enhance the Thieves' reputation.\n\nAs a Confidant, Mishima represents the [[The Moon (Tarot card)|Moon]] Arcana<ref name=\"Arcana\" /> and will give party members experience points. His fascination with the Phantom Thieves becomes an obsession, and Joker deduces that his motivation to help springs from insecurity and his desire for popularity. When Mishima runs into his bully from middle school, he threatens to have his heart changed. After Joker confronts his Shadow in Mementos, Mishima realizes the error of his ways and saves his bully from thugs.

Kawakami avoids Joker until he learns that she is also a maid to pay the guardians of Taiki Takase, a student from the previous school she worked at. Takase worked several part-time jobs to support his guardians' hedonistic lifestyle, frequently missing school and receiving low grades. When Kawakami began to tutor him, she was ordered by the principal to stop or resign because of Takase's rumored delinquency. Takase was killed in a car accident shortly afterwards, and his guardians use his death to extort money from Kawakami, threatening to sue her if she does not comply.\n\nAs a Confidant, Kawakami represents the [[Temperance (Tarot card)|Temperance]] Arcana.<ref name=\"Arcana\"/> She helps Joker with chores and gives him free time in class. Initially saying that it pays her sister's medical bills, Kawakami's second job allows her no time to rest and she is hospitalized with exhaustion.

He is a new counselor that arrives at Shujin Academy after the arrest of Kamoshida. The students seem to really like him, as he is able to listen to them and give them good advice. Contrary to Kasumi, his opinion towards the Phantom Thieves is very positive, as he thinks their actions can bring happiness and justice to people. It is eventually revealed he is a Persona user with the ability to alter the cognitions of others, altering their personalities and memories, which he uses for truly desperate cases as a stopgap to real treatment, and a peer of Wakaba's whose research was also stolen by Shido. During the conflict with Yaldabaoth, his despair at realizing how uncaring Shujin is towards its students causes him to become vulnerable to Yaldabaoth's own ability to warp cognition, causing part of his Persona [[Adam Kadmon]] to lose a component of itself as a Treasure, causing it to degenerate into [[Azathoth]] and he enters a delusional state where he believes the only way to improve the world is to use his abilities on everyone to create a utopia, becoming the final antagonist of ''Royal''. In the bad/neutral ending, Maruki takes a photo of the phantom thieves during the graduation and leaves the gang as he created a reality that people can have happiness in their lives. In the true ending, Maruki becomes a taxi driver and offers Joker a ride as he is being followed by officers. Maruki tells Joker that he will move forward in his life as well, just like how Joker and his friends will do the same.\n\n==Reception==\nThe game's characters were generally well-received.

They also carried out the functions of traveling heralds or ambassadors (''Pater Patratus'')<ref> According to one source the original meaning is unclear. The term could be read \"father of the fathers\", referring to the fetiales, or it could be read as a father whose own father is still living.

In another sense of the same verb, it could mean a father who is of great accomplishment or esteemed. ''An Etymological Dictionary of the Latin Language'', 1828, Francis Edward Jackson VALPY, pg. 324)</ref>.\nDIE KIdS\nThe first mention of the fetials by [[Livy]] occurs in the context of the [[Alba Longa#war with Rome|war between Alba Longa and Rome]], during which the Roman king [[Tullus Hostilius]] appointed M. Valerius as a fetial and Sp. Fusius as ''pater patratus'', for the purpose of binding Rome and Alba Longa by a treaty.<ref>Livy ''Ab Urbe Condita''  [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#32|I.32]].</ref>\n\nAccording to Livy, the ritual by which the fetials were to declare war, the ritual of ''rerum repetitio'', was introduced to Rome by [[Ancus Marcius]], borrowing on the traditions of the [[Aequi]]colae. However, he had already described the ritual actions of the fetials when recording the wars of [[Tullus Hostilius]].<ref>Livy, ''AUC'' [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#24|I.24]].</ref> Thus some scholars think the mentions of the Aequi may be a misinterpretation due to a folk etymology connecting Aequi to ''aequus'', the Latin adjective for fair.  On the other hand ancient sources support the tradition that the priesthood was created under the influence of Aequian king Ferter Resus.<ref>Inc. Auc. ''de Praenominibus'' I apud Valerius Maximus X: \"Fertorem Resium qui ius fetiale constituit\"; Inc. Auc. ''de Viribus Illustribus'' V 4 apud Aurelius Victor p. 29: \"(Ancus Martius) ius fetiale...ab  Aequicolis transtulit quod primus Ferter Rhesus excogitavisse\"; CIL  VI 1302 from the Palatine (II-I century BC); Festus s. v. Ferctius p. 81 L; Propertius IV 105-146; Plutarch Marcellus 8. 4, Romulus 16. 6.</ref>\n\n==''Rerum repetitio''==\nThe ritual of ''rerum repetitio'', a request of restitution or reparations, involved the ''pater patratus''. Wearing a woolen hair-band, he was to announce Roman demands using a series of prescribed phrases, first at the enemy's frontier, then when he passes over the borders, again to the first man he meets, again on entering the enemy's gate, and again on entering the forum at the presence of local magistrates. If the demands are not met, the ''pater patratus'' declares war within 33&nbsp;days and returns to Rome to await the resolution of the Roman king and senate. Once they have resolved to go to war, a fetial returns to the enemy frontier carrying a javelin with a steel or burnt tip, and dipped in blood. He declares war on the enemy, and throws the javelin into their territory.\n\nThe fetial is connected to matters of law and not directly to war, hence in his formulae he never invokes Mars, but Jupiter, Juno (or perhaps Janus) and Quirinius.\n\nThe religious relevance of the collegium or ''sodalitas'' lay in ensuring that Rome enjoyed the protection of gods in its relationships with foreign states.\n\nThis ''collegium'' was probably common to other Latin cities as Livy makes reference to the ''fetials'' of Alba.\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to some scholars,<ref>G. Dumezil, ''La religion romaine archa\u00efque'', 1974.</ref><ref>M. Morani \"Lat. sacer...nel lessico religioso latino\" ''Aevum'' LV, 1981, pp.30-46.</ref> the name derives from the noun root *''feti-'', which means 'foundation' and not 'stipulation'. It is allied to the basic religious concept of ''fas'', both being rooted in IE *''dh(e)s'', originally meaning 'to set, setting'. This root has given the verb ''facere'', 'to do, make' by a semantic shift. Both ''fetial'' and ''fas'' preserve the original sense of 'foundation' here, as in Vedic ''dhaman'', ''dhatu'' in its religious sense.\n\n==Religious implications==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\nThe implications of this etymology would hint to the fact that outside their own ''ager'' Romans  felt the need for a religious, founding justification of their actions as a people toward other ones. A need was felt to go beyond the sphere of human law or right. While juridical justification was acknowledged as necessary Romans wanted to ensure the approval of what founds right and makes it possible, the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#fas|fas]].\nThis attitude is testified by the ceremonies held by the ''fetials'' that confer religious value to political decisions and specifications in their dealing with foreign nations, aimed at placing the gods on the side of Rome and hence effectively entrusting to them the fate of Rome.\n\n==Details of the operative duties of the fetials==\nThe ''sodalitas'' dispatched two of its members, of whom only one, called the ''pater patratus'',<ref>The meaning of this title is unclear; according to Plutarch it denotes \"a man whose father is still alive and who has children\" (Mor. IV, 62), but he confuses it with ''pater patrimus''. The word ''patratus'' may be connected to either the noun ''pater'' (\"father\") or the verb ''patrare'' (\"to execute, bring about\"). Possible translations include \"one who is made father\" and \"the father accomplisher\". See A. Strobach, ''Plutarch und die Sprachen'' (1997), 78; R.E. Mitchell, \"The definition of ''patres'' and ''plebs'': an end to the struggle of the orders\", in K.A. Raaflaub, ''Social struggles in archaic Rome: new perspectives on the conflict of the orders'' (2005), 128-167, esp. 143.</ref> was active, while the other called ''verbenarius'' was limited in function to accompanying the ''pater patratus'' with sacred herbs (''sagmina'' of vervain) gathered on the [[Capitolium]].\n\nWe know the ceremonies and formulae of two circumstances:\n(1) conclusion of a treaty and (2) request of reparations and declaration of war.\n\nIn the first circumstance the ''pater patratus'' called standersby and the gods to witness, staked the word of Rome, and vowed Rome to divine wrath if it should not abide by its word, asking for ''execratio''. Oaths were made by Jupiter Lapis (''per Iovem Lapidem''). The flintstone was believed to be a seat of Jupiter's because if struck it emitted sparks, thus being analogous to lightning.\n\nThe ceremony has two known variants. In the first one the ''pater patratus'' hits a pig with flintstone taken from the temple of [[Jupiter Feretrius]] pronouncing the ''formula'' referred by Livy;<ref>Livy, ''AUC'' [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#24|I.24.8]]: \"Si prior defexit publico consilio dolo malo tum tu illo die, Jupiter, populum Romanum sic ferito ut ego hunc porcum hic hodie feriam, tantoque magis ferito quanto magis potes pollesque.\"</ref> in the second he throws the flintstone and vows Rome to fall as the stone itself if it should fail to abide by the oath.<ref>Pol. 3, 25, 6-9</ref>\n\nWhen Rome asked for reparations for an offense or damage, the fetials were sent as ambassadors to the foreign country concerned.\nIf the requests borne by the ''pater patratus'' were not met, he went back to Rome after invoking Jupiter, Juno (or Janus), and Quirinus, along with the heavenly gods, the terrestrial gods, and the gods of the netherworld as witnesses of the violation of the ''ius'' and after declaring war within 30 or 33&nbsp;days. When this period of time had expired he went back to the border and opened the hostilities with a magic gesture: while affirming once again the good right of Rome he threw a spear with steel point or a javelin of ''corniolum'' hardened with fire into the enemy's territory.<ref>Livy, ''AUC'' I, 32, 5-14; Dion. Hal. 2,72, 6-8</ref>\n\nThe fetials were a common institution of the Latins and of other Italic people.<ref>Dionysius  of Halicarnassus ''Ant. Rom.'' I 21, 1; II 72; Livy, ''AUC'' [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#32|I.32.4]].</ref>\n\nAccording to G. Dum\u00e9zil, the initial contract concluded with the gods and extended through the  ''sacra'' and the ''signa'' is sufficient to justify the acts of official religious authorities (such as pontiffs and augurs) within the Roman [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ager|''ager'']]. Actions beyond this boundary require an additional religious foundation, based not only on ''[[ius]]'' but also, on a deeper level, the ''fas'' on which ''ius'' is based. This is the task of the fetials who achieve their aim through the *''feti-'', word that as Vedic  ''dh\u0101tu'' means  ''founding''. They rely on a set of  ceremonies that bestow a religious value on the political or military decisions of the magistrates, ensuring that under any circumstance Rome has the gods on her side. Besides offering their advice on international issues to the senate or the consuls, the ''sodalitas'' dispatches two envoys (the ''pater patratus'' and the  ''verbenarius'', the last one having only the task of carrying the ''sagmina'' taken from the Capitol Hill)  to ask for the reparations, to declare war in a form that is pious and just, and lastly to conclude the peace. The god under whose protection they act and whom the ''pater patratus'' invokes is ''Iupiter Lapis'' in the rite of the conclusion of a treaty<ref>Livy [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#24|I.24.8]].</ref> and in general when there an agreement is reached. If a declaration of war ensues the fetial calls as witnesses Jupiter, Juno (or Janus, correction accepted by most editors), Quirinus, the heavenly, earthly and nether gods of the violation of the ''ius'' and  declares war within thirty-three days.<ref>Livy [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#32|I.32.10]].</ref>\n\n==Political implications of the ''ius fetiale''==\nThe author of Cicero's apocryphal speech of Furius Filus and the Christian apologists blamed the Romans for craftily using the ''ius fetiale'' in order to ensure divine support for Rome in international disputes. They allege that Romans were not moved by a desire for justice in their use of the ''ius fetiale'', but rather bent its rules and made a disproportionately excessive use of its technicalities to acquire an undue advantage over other peoples with the ultimate goal of stealing their lands and riches.\n\n==References==\n<references />There are two conflicting footnotes -- #1 and #7 -- for the same term, pater patratus.\n\n==Sources==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n\n*[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#24|1:24]], [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#32|32]]\n*Lit.

An example of this is the term \"groovy\" which is a relic of 1960's and 70's American \"hippy\" slang. Nevertheless, for a slang term to become a slang term, people must use it, at some point in time, as a way to flout standard language.<ref name=\"topical dictionary\" />  Additionally, slang terms may be borrowed between groups, such as the term \"gig\" which was originally coined by jazz musicians in the 1930s and then borrowed into the same hippy slang of the 1960s.<ref name=\"topical dictionary\" /> 'The word \"groovy\" has remained a part of subculture lexicon since its popularization. It is still in common use today by a significant population. The word \"gig\" to refer to a performance very likely originated well before the 1930s, and remained a common term throughout the 1940s and 1950s before becoming a vaguely associated with the \"hippy slang of the 1960s\". The word \"gig\" is now a widely accepted synonym for a concert, recital, or performance of any type. \"Hippy\" is more commonly spelled \"hippie\".\n\nGenerally, slang terms undergo the same processes of [[semantic change]] that words in the regular lexicon do.<ref name=Coleman />\n\nSlang often will form from words with previously differing meanings, one example is the often used and popular slang word \"lit\", which was created by a generation labeled \"Generation Z\". The word itself used to be associated with something being on fire or being \"lit\" up until 1988 when it was first used in writing to indicate a person who was drunk<ref>{{Cite book|title=Warbirds: Diary of an Unknown Aviator|last=Girder|first=John|publisher=Texas A & M University Press|year=1988}}</ref> in the book \"Warbirds: Diary of an Unknown Aviator\". Since this time \"lit\" has gained popularity through Rap songs such as ASAP Rocky's \"Get Lit\" in 2011. As the popularity of the word has increased so too has the number of different meanings associated with the word. Now \"lit\" describes a person who is drunk and/or high, as well as an event that is especially awesome and \"hype\".\n\nWords and phrases from popular [[Hollywood films]] and [[television series]] frequently become slang.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Merry|first1=Stephanie|title=\u2018As if\u2019: 40 comedies from the past 40 years that changed the way we talk|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/classic-apps/as-if-40-comedies-from-the-past-40-years-that-changed-the-way-we-talk/2018/03/28/affa2e04-2889-11e8-874b-d517e912f125_story.html?wpisrc=nl_rainbow&wpmm=1|website=Washington Post|accessdate=9 April 2018|date=29 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Social implications ==\n\n=== Indexicality ===\nSlang is usually associated with a particular group and plays a role in constructing our identities. While slang outlines social space, attitudes about slang partly construct group identity and identify individuals as members of groups. Therefore, using the slang of a particular group will associate an individual with that group. Using [[Michael Silverstein|Silverstein's]] notion of different orders of [[indexicality]], it can be said that a slang term can be a second-order index to this particular group. Employing a slang term, however, can also give an individual the qualities associated with the term's group of origin, whether or not the individual is actually trying to identify as a member of the group. This allocation of qualities based on abstract group association is known as third-order indexicality.\n\nAs outlined by Elisa Mattiello in her book,<ref name=\"Mattiello\">{{cite book|last=Mattiello|first=Elisa|title=An introduction to English slang: a description of its morphology, semantics and sociology|year=2008|publisher=Polimetrica|location=Milano|isbn=8876991131}}</ref> a slang term can take on various levels of identification. Giving the examples of the terms \"foxy\" and \"shagadelic\", Mattiello explains that neither term makes sense given a standard interpretation of English:\n* \"foxy\", although clearly a \"denominal adjective\" from its -y suffix, does not make sense semantically, as it is a synonym with sexy and has nothing to do with foxes;<ref>It should, perhaps, be pointed out that the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines ''foxy'' as 'foxlike; of the nature or appearance of a fox; esp. crafty, cunning' and cites an example from [[Tennyson]].</ref>\n* \"shagadelic\" is a combination of a slang term with a slang [[suffix]] and therefore is considered an \"extra-grammatical\" creation.\n\nNevertheless, Matiello concludes that those [[Agency (sociology)|agents]] who identify themselves as \"young men\" have \"genuinely coined\" these terms and choose to use them over \"canonical\" terms \u2014like beautiful or sexy\u2014because of the indexicalized social identifications the former convey.\n\n==== First and second order indexicality ====\nIn terms of first and second order indexicality, the usage of speaker-oriented terms  by male adolescents indicated their membership to their age group, to reinforce connection to their peer group, and to exclude outsiders.<ref name=Mattiello />\n\n==== Higher-order indexicality ====\nIn terms of higher order indexicality, anyone using these terms may desire to appear fresher, undoubtedly more playful, faddish, and colourful than someone who employs the standard English term \"beautiful\". This appearance relies heavily on the hearer's third-order understanding of the term's associated social nuances and presupposed use-cases.<ref name=Mattiello />\n\n=== Subculture associations ===\nOften, distinct subcultures will create slang that members will use in order to associate themselves with the group, or to delineate outsiders.\n\nSlang terms are often known only within a [[clique]] or [[ingroup]]. For example, [[Leet]] (\"Leetspeak\" or \"1337\") was originally popular only among certain Internet subcultures, such as [[Software cracking|software crackers]] and online video gamers. During the 1990s, and into the early 21st century, however, Leet became increasingly more commonplace on the Internet, and it has spread outside Internet-based communication and into spoken languages.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Anthony|title=A Leet Primer|date=December 6, 2005|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/47607.html#|accessdate=2007-11-05}}</ref> Other types of slang include [[SMS language]] used on mobile phones, and \"chatspeak\", (e.g., \"[[LOL]]\", an acronym meaning \"laughing out loud\" or \"laugh out loud\" or [[ROFL]], \"rolling on the floor laughing\"), which are widely used in instant messaging on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Slang Dictionary|url=http://slang-dictionary.weebly.com/}}</ref>\n\nAs subcultures are also often forms of counterculture and counterculture itself can be defined as going against a standard, it follows that slang has come to be associated with counterculture.\n\n=== Social media and Internet slang ===\nSlang is often taken from social media as a sign of social awareness and shared knowledge of [[popular culture]]. This particular branch of slang has become more prevalent since the early 2000s as a result of the rise in popularity of social networking services, including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Instagram]]. This has created new vocabularies associated with each new social media venue, such as the use of the term \"friending\" on Facebook, which is a [[verbification]] of \"friend\" used to describe the process of adding a new person to one's list of friends on the website, despite the existence of an analogous term \"befriend\". This term is much older than Facebook, but has only recently entered the popular lexicon.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Garber|first1=Megan|title='Friend,' as a Verb, Is 800 Years Old|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/friend-as-a-verb-is-800-years-old/278109/|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref> Other examples of the slang found in social media include a general trend toward shortened words or acronyms. These are especially associated with services such as Twitter, which now has a 280 character limit for each message and therefore requires a briefer, more condensed manner of communication.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=Caroline|title=Our Updated Guide To Twitter Slang, Lingo, Abbreviations And Acronyms|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/a-guide-to-twitter-slang-lingo-abbreviations-and-acronyms-2013-9|work=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref> This includes the use of [[hashtags]] which explicitly state the main content of a message or image, such as #food or #photography.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fortunato|first1=Joe|title=The Hashtag: A History Deeper than Twitter|url=http://www.copypress.com/blog/the-hashtag-a-history-deeper-than-twitter/|website=copypress.com|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Debates about slang ===\n\nSome critics believe that when slang becomes more commonplace it effectively eradicates the \"proper\" use of a certain language. However, academic (descriptive) linguists believe that language is not static but ever-changing and that slang terms are valid words within a language's lexicon. While [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptivists]] study and promote the socially preferable or \"correct\" ways to speak, according to a language's normative grammar and syntactical words, [[Linguistic description|descriptivists]] focus on studying language to further understand the subconscious rules of how individuals speak, which makes slang important in understanding such rules. Noam Chomsky, a founder of anthropological linguistic thought, challenged structural and prescriptive grammar and began to study sounds and morphemes functionally, as well as their [[language change|changes]] within a language over time.<ref>Rowe, Bruce M., and Diane P.

The word \"gig\" to refer to a performance very likely originated well before the 1930s, and remained a common term throughout the 1940s and 1950s before becoming a vaguely associated with the \"hippy slang of the 1960s\". The word \"gig\" is now a widely accepted synonym for a concert, recital, or performance of any type. \"Hippy\" is more commonly spelled \"hippie\".\n\nGenerally, slang terms undergo the same processes of [[semantic change]] that words in the regular lexicon do.<ref name=Coleman />\n\nSlang often will form from words with previously differing meanings, one example is the often used and popular slang word \"lit\", which was created by a generation labeled \"Generation Z\". The word itself used to be associated with something being on fire or being \"lit\" up until 1988 when it was first used in writing to indicate a person who was drunk<ref>{{Cite book|title=Warbirds: Diary of an Unknown Aviator|last=Girder|first=John|publisher=Texas A & M University Press|year=1988}}</ref> in the book \"Warbirds: Diary of an Unknown Aviator\". Since this time \"lit\" has gained popularity through Rap songs such as ASAP Rocky's \"Get Lit\" in 2011. As the popularity of the word has increased so too has the number of different meanings associated with the word. Now \"lit\" describes a person who is drunk and/or high, as well as an event that is especially awesome and \"hype\".\n\nWords and phrases from popular [[Hollywood films]] and [[television series]] frequently become slang.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Merry|first1=Stephanie|title=\u2018As if\u2019: 40 comedies from the past 40 years that changed the way we talk|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/classic-apps/as-if-40-comedies-from-the-past-40-years-that-changed-the-way-we-talk/2018/03/28/affa2e04-2889-11e8-874b-d517e912f125_story.html?wpisrc=nl_rainbow&wpmm=1|website=Washington Post|accessdate=9 April 2018|date=29 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Social implications ==\n\n=== Indexicality ===\nSlang is usually associated with a particular group and plays a role in constructing our identities. While slang outlines social space, attitudes about slang partly construct group identity and identify individuals as members of groups. Therefore, using the slang of a particular group will associate an individual with that group. Using [[Michael Silverstein|Silverstein's]] notion of different orders of [[indexicality]], it can be said that a slang term can be a second-order index to this particular group. Employing a slang term, however, can also give an individual the qualities associated with the term's group of origin, whether or not the individual is actually trying to identify as a member of the group. This allocation of qualities based on abstract group association is known as third-order indexicality.\n\nAs outlined by Elisa Mattiello in her book,<ref name=\"Mattiello\">{{cite book|last=Mattiello|first=Elisa|title=An introduction to English slang: a description of its morphology, semantics and sociology|year=2008|publisher=Polimetrica|location=Milano|isbn=8876991131}}</ref> a slang term can take on various levels of identification. Giving the examples of the terms \"foxy\" and \"shagadelic\", Mattiello explains that neither term makes sense given a standard interpretation of English:\n* \"foxy\", although clearly a \"denominal adjective\" from its -y suffix, does not make sense semantically, as it is a synonym with sexy and has nothing to do with foxes;<ref>It should, perhaps, be pointed out that the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines ''foxy'' as 'foxlike; of the nature or appearance of a fox; esp. crafty, cunning' and cites an example from [[Tennyson]].</ref>\n* \"shagadelic\" is a combination of a slang term with a slang [[suffix]] and therefore is considered an \"extra-grammatical\" creation.\n\nNevertheless, Matiello concludes that those [[Agency (sociology)|agents]] who identify themselves as \"young men\" have \"genuinely coined\" these terms and choose to use them over \"canonical\" terms \u2014like beautiful or sexy\u2014because of the indexicalized social identifications the former convey.\n\n==== First and second order indexicality ====\nIn terms of first and second order indexicality, the usage of speaker-oriented terms  by male adolescents indicated their membership to their age group, to reinforce connection to their peer group, and to exclude outsiders.<ref name=Mattiello />\n\n==== Higher-order indexicality ====\nIn terms of higher order indexicality, anyone using these terms may desire to appear fresher, undoubtedly more playful, faddish, and colourful than someone who employs the standard English term \"beautiful\". This appearance relies heavily on the hearer's third-order understanding of the term's associated social nuances and presupposed use-cases.<ref name=Mattiello />\n\n=== Subculture associations ===\nOften, distinct subcultures will create slang that members will use in order to associate themselves with the group, or to delineate outsiders.\n\nSlang terms are often known only within a [[clique]] or [[ingroup]]. For example, [[Leet]] (\"Leetspeak\" or \"1337\") was originally popular only among certain Internet subcultures, such as [[Software cracking|software crackers]] and online video gamers. During the 1990s, and into the early 21st century, however, Leet became increasingly more commonplace on the Internet, and it has spread outside Internet-based communication and into spoken languages.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Anthony|title=A Leet Primer|date=December 6, 2005|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/47607.html#|accessdate=2007-11-05}}</ref> Other types of slang include [[SMS language]] used on mobile phones, and \"chatspeak\", (e.g., \"[[LOL]]\", an acronym meaning \"laughing out loud\" or \"laugh out loud\" or [[ROFL]], \"rolling on the floor laughing\"), which are widely used in instant messaging on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Slang Dictionary|url=http://slang-dictionary.weebly.com/}}</ref>\n\nAs subcultures are also often forms of counterculture and counterculture itself can be defined as going against a standard, it follows that slang has come to be associated with counterculture.\n\n=== Social media and Internet slang ===\nSlang is often taken from social media as a sign of social awareness and shared knowledge of [[popular culture]]. This particular branch of slang has become more prevalent since the early 2000s as a result of the rise in popularity of social networking services, including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Instagram]]. This has created new vocabularies associated with each new social media venue, such as the use of the term \"friending\" on Facebook, which is a [[verbification]] of \"friend\" used to describe the process of adding a new person to one's list of friends on the website, despite the existence of an analogous term \"befriend\". This term is much older than Facebook, but has only recently entered the popular lexicon.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Garber|first1=Megan|title='Friend,' as a Verb, Is 800 Years Old|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/friend-as-a-verb-is-800-years-old/278109/|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref> Other examples of the slang found in social media include a general trend toward shortened words or acronyms. These are especially associated with services such as Twitter, which now has a 280 character limit for each message and therefore requires a briefer, more condensed manner of communication.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=Caroline|title=Our Updated Guide To Twitter Slang, Lingo, Abbreviations And Acronyms|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/a-guide-to-twitter-slang-lingo-abbreviations-and-acronyms-2013-9|work=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref> This includes the use of [[hashtags]] which explicitly state the main content of a message or image, such as #food or #photography.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fortunato|first1=Joe|title=The Hashtag: A History Deeper than Twitter|url=http://www.copypress.com/blog/the-hashtag-a-history-deeper-than-twitter/|website=copypress.com|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Debates about slang ===\n\nSome critics believe that when slang becomes more commonplace it effectively eradicates the \"proper\" use of a certain language. However, academic (descriptive) linguists believe that language is not static but ever-changing and that slang terms are valid words within a language's lexicon. While [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptivists]] study and promote the socially preferable or \"correct\" ways to speak, according to a language's normative grammar and syntactical words, [[Linguistic description|descriptivists]] focus on studying language to further understand the subconscious rules of how individuals speak, which makes slang important in understanding such rules. Noam Chomsky, a founder of anthropological linguistic thought, challenged structural and prescriptive grammar and began to study sounds and morphemes functionally, as well as their [[language change|changes]] within a language over time.<ref>Rowe, Bruce M., and Diane P.
