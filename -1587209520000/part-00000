He is known for his speed on the ball. After leaving Nigeria for Italy at age 16, he has since played for a number of [[List of top-division football clubs in UEFA countries|top-division clubs around Europe]]. He began his senior career in 2002 at [[Serie A]] club [[Inter Milan]], before moving to [[Premier League]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2006, and then to [[Bundesliga]] club [[VfL Wolfsburg]] in 2009. Having joined [[Russian Premier League]] side Rubin Kazan in July 2010, they [[loan (sports)|loaned]] him to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in January 2011.\n\nIn club football, Martins has won the Serie A title, the [[Coppa Italia|Italian Cup]] (twice), and the [[Supercoppa Italiana|Italian Super Cup]], all with Inter. With Birmingham he scored the winning goal in the [[2011 Football League Cup Final]]. He has played [[European football]] with Inter, Newcastle and Wolfsburg, winning the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] with Newcastle. His highest scoring league seasons so far have seen him score 11 goals in the [[2004\u201305 Serie A]], and 17 in both the [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League|2006\u201307 Premier League]] and [[2014 Major League Soccer season|2014 MLS]].

He played for [[Seattle Sounders FC]] of Major League Soccer from 2013 to 2015, scoring 40 goals, before moving on to China.\n\nMartins had two brothers who also played football professionally. His elder brother, [[Oladipupo Martins]], played for [[A.C. Reggiana 1919|Reggiana]], [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] and [[Innsbrucker AC|Innsbruck]] before retiring from football in 2009 due to heart problems.

Despite this he managed to score consistently, and when Allardyce was sacked and [[Kevin Keegan]] was appointed, Martins found himself being used as part of a three pronged attack along with Owen and Viduka.

He is known for his speed on the ball. After leaving Nigeria for Italy at age 16, he has since played for a number of [[List of top-division football clubs in UEFA countries|top-division clubs around Europe]]. He began his senior career in 2002 at [[Serie A]] club [[Inter Milan]], before moving to [[Premier League]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2006, and then to [[Bundesliga]] club [[VfL Wolfsburg]] in 2009. Having joined [[Russian Premier League]] side Rubin Kazan in July 2010, they [[loan (sports)|loaned]] him to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in January 2011.\n\nIn club football, Martins has won the Serie A title, the [[Coppa Italia|Italian Cup]] (twice), and the [[Supercoppa Italiana|Italian Super Cup]], all with Inter. With Birmingham he scored the winning goal in the [[2011 Football League Cup Final]]. He has played [[European football]] with Inter, Newcastle and Wolfsburg, winning the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] with Newcastle. His highest scoring league seasons so far have seen him score 11 goals in the [[2004\u201305 Serie A]], and 17 in both the [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League|2006\u201307 Premier League]] and [[2014 Major League Soccer season|2014 MLS]]. In international football, Martins has been in the Nigerian squad for the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] in [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|2006]], [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations|2008]] and [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations|2010]], and for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. He played for [[Seattle Sounders FC]] of Major League Soccer from 2013 to 2015, scoring 40 goals, before moving on to China.\n\nMartins had two brothers who also played football professionally. His elder brother, [[Oladipupo Martins]], played for [[A.C. Reggiana 1919|Reggiana]], [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] and [[Innsbrucker AC|Innsbruck]] before retiring from football in 2009 due to heart problems. He died on 8 August 2011 of a suspected heart attack in Lagos, Nigeria.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://socqer.com/questions/839/how-did-nigerias-obafemi-martins-brother-die/ | title = How Did Nigeria's Obafemi Martins' Brother Die? | publisher = Socqer.com | date = 10 August 2011 | accessdate =3 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/08/martins%E2%80%99-brother-dies-of-heart-problem/ | title = Martins' Brother Dies of Heart Problem | publisher = Vanguard | date = 9 August 2011 | accessdate =3 August 2012}}</ref> Martins' younger brother is John Ronan Martins.

Ebedei]], having been scouted by manager [[Churchill Oliseh]] while playing on the streets of his hometown. After a year with the club, [[Serie C]] side [[A.C. Reggiana 1919|A.C. Reggiana]] made a move for the player. After a three-month trial, Martins and fellow Ebedei teammate [[Stephen Makinwa]] signed youth contracts with the club in 2000. His first season in Italy saw Martins break into the first team squad, and later in the year [[Serie A]] sides [[Perugia]] and [[Inter Milan]] made offers for the [[forward (football)|forward]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/obafemi-martins-leap-of-faith-from-lagos-to-newcastle-462901.html|title=Obafemi Martins: Leap of faith from Lagos to Newcastle|date=25 August 2007|work=The Independent|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v400bnd5?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/obafemi-martins-leap-of-faith-from-lagos-to-newcastle-462901.html|archivedate=18 December 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Inter Milan===\n[[File:17 aprile al meazza (9689231) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Martins (right) with Inter Milan in 2005]]\nMartins was signed by Inter Milan in 2001 for a \u20ac750,000 [[transfer fee]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://110.inter.it/en/obafemi-martins-en/martins-testo3eng/|title=Mister Oba Oba|publisher=inter.it|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref> and in his first season he scored 23 goals for the youth team, helping them to win the [[Campionato Nazionale Primavera]] in 2001\u201302 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2002/febbraio/12/festa_tutta_dell_Inter_ga_0_0202121158.shtml|title=La festa \u00e8 tutta dell' Inter|trans-title=The celebration is all for Inter|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|date=12 February 2002|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref> His form for the youth side led to his first-team league debut the following season, starting in a match against [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] on 22 December 2002 which was won by Inter 2\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calcio.com/cronaca_partita/serie-a-2002-2003-parma-fc-inter/|title=Parma 1:2 Inter|publisher=Calcio.com|language=Italian|date=22 December 2002|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nMartins didn't become a regular member of the first team squad until the 2002\u201303 season.

It turned out that Martins suffered a severe dead leg and internal bleeding.

With new manager [[Sam Allardyce]] preferring to play [[Michael Owen]] and [[Mark Viduka]] up front, Martins found himself being used as an impact substitute for the first half of the season. Despite this he managed to score consistently, and when Allardyce was sacked and [[Kevin Keegan]] was appointed, Martins found himself being used as part of a three pronged attack along with Owen and Viduka. Martins scored fewer goals in his second season with Newcastle, mainly due to him no longer being the focal point of all their attacks as he was in his first season with them, as well as his season being interrupted with the African Cup of Nations participation with Nigeria in December.\n\nMartins scored six goals in 12 league games during the first half of the 2008\u201309 season before a torn hamstring ruled him out for several games.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/football/3993745.Martins_missing_for_Magpies_against_Spurs/|title=Martins missing for Magpies against Spurs|date=21 December 2008|accessdate=29 December 2008|newspaper=The Northern Echo | first = Paul | last = Fraser}}</ref> It was confirmed on 7 January 2009, that Martins would undergo hernia surgery in Germany the next Monday.

Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be '''acidic'''.\n\nCommon aqueous acids include [[hydrochloric acid]] (a solution of [[hydrogen chloride]] which is found in [[gastric acid]] in the stomach and activates [[digestive enzymes]]), [[acetic acid]] (vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid), [[sulfuric acid]] (used in [[car battery|car batteries]]), and [[citric acid]] (found in citrus fruits). As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict<ref name=\"IUPAC_acid\"/> sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases. [[Acid strength|Strong acid]]s and some concentrated weak acids are [[corrosive substance|corrosive]], but there are exceptions such as [[carborane]]s and [[boric acid]].\n\nThe second category of acids are [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acids]], which form a covalent bond with an electron pair. An example is [[boron trifluoride]] (BF<sub>3</sub>), whose boron atom has a vacant [[atomic orbital|orbital]] which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base, for example the nitrogen atom in [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>). [[Gilbert N. Lewis|Lewis]] considered this as a generalization of the Br\u00f8nsted definition, so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly ''or'' by releasing protons (H<sup>+</sup>) into the solution, which then accept electron pairs. However, hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most other Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids.<ref name=\"Oxtoby8th\">Oxtoby, D.

In modern terminology, an ''acid'' is implicitly a Br\u00f8nsted acid and not a Lewis acid, since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as ''a Lewis acid''.<ref name=\"Oxtoby8th\" />\n\n==Definitions and concepts==\n{{main|Acid\u2013base reaction}}\nModern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids.\n\nMost acids encountered in everyday life are [[aqueous solutions]], or can be dissolved in water, so the Arrhenius and Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant.\n\nThe Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition; unless otherwise specified, acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton (H<sup>+</sup>) from an [https://www.draughtsmancivilnotes.in/2020/04/rock-forming-minerals.html acid] to a base.\n\nHydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions. Although alcohols and amines can be Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids, they can also function as [[Lewis base]]s due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms.\n\n===Arrhenius acids===\n[[File:Arrhenius2.jpg|thumb|150px|Svante Arrhenius]]\n\nThe Swedish chemist [[Svante Arrhenius]] attributed the properties of acidity to [[hydron (chemistry)|hydrogen ions]] (H<sup>+</sup>) or [[proton]]s in 1884. An '''Arrhenius acid''' is a substance that, when added to water, increases the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions in the water.<ref name=\"Oxtoby8th\"/><ref name=\"Ebbing\">Ebbing, D.D., & Gammon, S. D. (2005). ''General chemistry'' (8th ed.). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin. {{ISBN|0-618-51177-6}}</ref> Note that chemists often write H<sup>+</sup>(''aq'') and refer to the [[hydrogen ion]] when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus, a [[proton]], does not exist alone in water, it exists as the hydronium ion, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>. Thus, an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water. Examples include molecular substances such as HCl and acetic acid.\n\nAn Arrhenius [[base (chemistry)|base]], on the other hand, is a substance which increases the concentration of [[hydroxide]] (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) ions when dissolved in water. This decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form H<sub>2</sub>O molecules:\n\nH<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + OH{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} \u21cc H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>\n\nDue to this equilibrium, any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide. Thus, an Arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration, while an Arrhenius base increases it.\n\nIn an acidic solution, the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10<sup>\u22127</sup> [[Mole (unit)|moles]] per liter. Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions, acidic solutions thus have a pH of less than 7.\n\n===Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acids{{anchor|Br\u00f8nsted acids}}===\n{{Main|Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base theory}}\n\n[[File:Acetic-acid-dissociation-3D-balls.png|thumb|350px|alt=Acetic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH, is composed of a methyl group, CH<sub>3</sub>, bound chemically to a carboxylate group, COOH. The carboxylate group can lose a proton and donate it to a water molecule, H<sub>2</sub>0, leaving behind an acetate anion CH<sub>3</sub>COO- and creating a hydronium cation H<sub>3</sub>O. This is an equilibrium reaction, so the reverse process can also take place.|[[Acetic acid]], a [[weak acid]], donates a proton (hydrogen ion, highlighted in green) to water in an equilibrium reaction to give the [[acetate]] ion and the [[hydronium]] ion. Red: oxygen, black: carbon, white: hydrogen.]]\n\nWhile the Arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope. In 1923 chemists [[Johannes Nicolaus Br\u00f8nsted]] and [[Thomas Martin Lowry]] independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton. A '''Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid''' (or simply Br\u00f8nsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry base.<ref name=\"Ebbing\" /> Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over Arrhenius theory. Consider the following reactions of [[acetic acid]] (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH), the [[organic acid]] that gives vinegar its characteristic taste:\n\n:{{chem|CH|3|COOH}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} {{chem|CH|3|COO|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|3|O|+}}\n:{{chem|CH|3|COOH}} + {{chem|NH|3}} {{eqm}} {{chem|CH|3|COO|\u2212}} + {{chem|NH|4|+}}\n\nBoth theories easily describe the first reaction: CH<sub>3</sub>COOH acts as an Arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> when dissolved in water, and it acts as a Br\u00f8nsted acid by donating a proton to water. In the second example CH<sub>3</sub>COOH undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton to ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but does not relate to the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium. Nevertheless, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH is both an Arrhenius and a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid.\n\nBr\u00f8nsted-Lowry theory can be used to describe reactions of [[molecule|molecular compounds]] in nonaqueous solution or the gas phase. [[Hydrogen chloride]] (HCl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form [[ammonium chloride]], NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. In aqueous solution HCl behaves as [[hydrochloric acid]] and exists as hydronium and chloride ions. The following reactions illustrate the limitations of Arrhenius's definition:\n# H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + Cl{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} + NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Cl{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} + NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\n# HCl<sub>(benzene)</sub> + NH<sub>3(benzene)</sub> \u2192 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>(s)</sub>\n# HCl<sub>(g)</sub> + NH<sub>3(g)</sub> \u2192 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>(s)</sub>\n\nAs with the acetic acid reactions, both definitions work for the first example, where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the HCl solute. The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton-transfer reactions. In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in [[benzene]]) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and NH<sub>3</sub> combine to form the solid.\n\n===Lewis acids===\n{{main|Lewis acids and bases}}\nA third, only marginally related concept was proposed in 1923 by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer. A '''Lewis acid''' is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; in other words, it is an electron pair acceptor.<ref name=\"Ebbing\" /> Br\u00f8nsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while Lewis acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers. Many Lewis acids are not Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids. Contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acid-base chemistry:\n:[[File:LewisAcid.png|374px]]\nIn the first reaction a [[fluoride|fluoride ion]], F<sup>\u2212</sup>, gives up an [[lone pair|electron pair]] to [[boron trifluoride]] to form the product [[tetrafluoroborate]]. Fluoride \"loses\" a pair of [[valence electron]]s because the electrons shared in the B\u2014F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion. BF<sub>3</sub> is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride. This reaction cannot be described in terms of Br\u00f8nsted theory because there is no proton transfer. The second reaction can be described using either theory. A proton is transferred from an unspecified Br\u00f8nsted acid to ammonia, a Br\u00f8nsted base; alternatively, ammonia acts as a Lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion. The species that gains the electron pair is the Lewis acid; for example, the oxygen atom in H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> gains a pair of electrons when one of the H\u2014O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen. Depending on the context, a Lewis acid may also be described as an [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizer]] or an [[electrophile]]. Organic Br\u00f8nsted acids, such as acetic, citric, or oxalic acid, are not Lewis acids.<ref name=\"Oxtoby8th\" /> They dissociate in water to produce a Lewis acid, H<sup>+</sup>, but at the same time also yield an equal amount of a Lewis base (acetate, citrate, or oxalate, respectively, for the acids mentioned). Few, if any, of the acids discussed in the following are Lewis acids.\n\n==Dissociation and equilibrium==\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Free acid]] -->\nReactions of acids are often generalized in the form HA {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + A<sup>\u2212</sup>, where HA represents the acid and A<sup>\u2212</sup> is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]]. This reaction is referred to as '''protolysis'''. The protonated form (HA) of an acid is also sometimes referred to as the '''free acid'''.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last1 = Stahl | editor-first1 = P.

Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as HA<sup>+</sup> {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + A. In solution there exists an [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between the acid and its conjugate base. The [[equilibrium constant]] ''K'' is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution. Brackets indicate concentration, such that [H<sub>2</sub>O] means ''the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O''. The [[acid dissociation constant]] ''K''<sub>a</sub> is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions. The numerical value of ''K''<sub>a</sub> is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H<sup>+</sup>.\n:<math chem>K_a = \\frac\\ce{[H+] [A^{-}]}\\ce{[HA]}</math>\nThe stronger of two acids will have a higher ''K''<sub>a</sub> than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for ''K''<sub>a</sub> spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, p''K''<sub>a</sub> is more frequently used, where p''K''<sub>a</sub> = &minus;log<sub>10</sub> ''K''<sub>a</sub>. Stronger acids have a smaller p''K''<sub>a</sub> than weaker acids. Experimentally determined p''K''<sub>a</sub> at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nArrhenius acids are named according to their [[anion]]s. In the classical naming system, the ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix, according to the table following. The prefix \"hydro-\" is used when the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element. For example, HCl has [[chloride]] as its anion, so the hydro- prefix is used, and the -ide suffix makes the name take the form [[hydrochloric acid]].    \n\n''Classical naming system:''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Anion prefix\n!Anion suffix\n!Acid prefix\n!Acid suffix\n!Example\n|-\n|per\n|ate\n|per\n|ic acid\n|[[perchloric acid]] (HClO<sub>4</sub>)\n|-\n|\n|ate\n|\n|ic acid\n|[[chloric acid]] (HClO<sub>3</sub>)\n|-\n|\n|ite\n|\n|ous acid\n|[[chlorous acid]] (HClO<sub>2</sub>)\n|-\n|hypo\n|ite\n|hypo\n|ous acid\n|[[hypochlorous acid]] (HClO)\n|-\n|\n|ide\n|hydro\n|ic acid\n|[[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl)\n|}\n\nIn the [[IUPAC]] naming system, \"aqueous\" is simply added to the name of the ionic compound.    Thus, for hydrogen chloride, as an acid solution, the IUPAC name is aqueous hydrogen chloride.\n\n==Acid strength==\n{{main|Acid strength}}\n\nThe strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H<sup>+</sup> and one mole of the conjugate base, A<sup>\u2212</sup>, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of [[strong acid]]s are [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), [[perchloric acid]] (HClO<sub>4</sub>), [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>) and [[sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H<sup>+</sup>. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the [[chemical polarity|polarity]] of the H\u2014A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H\u2014A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.\n\nStronger acids have a larger ''K''<sub>a</sub> and a more negative p''K''<sub>a</sub> than weaker acids.\n\nSulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids. A common example is [[toluenesulfonic acid]] (tosylic acid). Unlike sulfuric acid itself, sulfonic acids can be solids. In fact, [[polystyrene]] functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.\n\n[[Superacid]]s are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid. Examples of superacids are [[fluoroantimonic acid]], [[magic acid]] and [[perchloric acid]]. Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline [[hydronium]] \"salts\". They can also quantitatively stabilize [[carbocation]]s.\n\nWhile ''K''<sub>a</sub> measures the strength of an acid compound, the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH, which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution.  The pH of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound's ''K''<sub>a</sub>.\n\n==Chemical characteristics==\n\n===Monoprotic acids===\nMonoprotic acids, also known as monobasic acids, are those acids that are able to donate one [[proton]] per molecule during the process of [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA):\n:HA<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a</sub>\n\nCommon examples of monoprotic acids in [[mineral acid]]s include [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>). On the other hand, for [[organic acids]] the term mainly indicates the presence of one [[carboxylic acid]] group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid. Examples in [[organic acids]] include [[formic acid]] (HCOOH), [[acetic acid]] (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) and [[benzoic acid]] (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COOH).\n{{See also|Acid dissociation constant#Monoprotic acids}}\n\n===Polyprotic acids===\nPolyprotic acids, also known as polybasic acids, are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule. Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as diprotic (or dibasic) acid (two potential protons to donate), and triprotic (or tribasic) acid (three potential protons to donate).\n\nA diprotic acid (here symbolized by H<sub>2</sub>A) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH. Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, K<sub>a1</sub> and K<sub>a2</sub>.\n:{{nowrap|H<sub>2</sub>A<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + HA{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a1</sub>}}\n:{{nowrap|HA{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=2\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a2</sub>}}\n\nThe first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., ''K''<sub>a1</sub> > ''K''<sub>a2</sub>. For example, [[sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) can donate one proton to form the [[bisulfate]] anion (HSO{{su|b=4|p=\u2212}}), for which ''K''<sub>a1</sub> is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the [[sulfate]] anion (SO{{su|b=4|p=2\u2212}}), wherein the ''K''<sub>a2</sub> is intermediate strength. The large ''K''<sub>a1</sub> for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid. In a similar manner, the weak unstable [[carbonic acid]] {{nowrap|(H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>)}} can lose one proton to form [[bicarbonate]] anion {{nowrap|(HCO{{su|b=3|p=\u2212}})}} and lose a second to form [[carbonate]] anion (CO{{su|b=3|p=2\u2212}}). Both ''K''<sub>a</sub> values are small, but ''K''<sub>a1</sub> > ''K''<sub>a2</sub> .\n\nA triprotic acid (H<sub>3</sub>A) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where ''K''<sub>a1</sub> > ''K''<sub>a2</sub> > ''K''<sub>a3</sub>.\n:{{nowrap|H<sub>3</sub>A<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>A{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a1</sub>}}\n:{{nowrap|H<sub>2</sub>A{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + HA{{su|p=2\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a2</sub>}}\n:{{nowrap|HA{{su|p=2\u2212|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=3\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ''K''<sub>a3</sub>}}\n\nAn [[inorganic]] example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), usually just called [[phosphoric acid]]. All three protons can be successively lost to yield H<sub>2</sub>PO{{su|b=4|p=\u2212}}, then HPO{{su|b=4|p=2\u2212}}, and finally PO{{su|b=4|p=3\u2212}}, the orthophosphate ion, usually just called [[phosphate]]. Even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent, the successive ''K''<sub>a</sub> values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged. An [[organic compound|organic]] example of a triprotic acid is [[citric acid]], which can successively lose three protons to finally form the [[citrate]] ion.\n\nAlthough the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable, all of the conjugate bases are present in solution. The fractional concentration, ''\u03b1'' (alpha), for each species can be calculated. For example, a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: H<sub>2</sub>A, HA<sup>\u2212</sup>, and A<sup>2\u2212</sup>. The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH (which can be converted to the [H<sup>+</sup>]) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases:\n:<math chem>\\begin{align}\n\\alpha_\\ce{H2A}   &= \\frac{\\ce{[H+]^2}}{\\ce{[H+]^2}  + [\\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2}  = \\frac{\\ce{[H2A]}}{\\ce{{[H2A]}} + [HA^-] + [A^{2-}]}\\\\ \n\\alpha_\\ce{HA^-}  &= \\frac{[\\ce{H+}]K_1}{\\ce{[H+]^2} + [\\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2}  = \\frac{\\ce{[HA^-]}}{\\ce{[H2A]}+{[HA^-]}+{[A^{2-}]}}\\\\\n\\alpha_\\ce{A^{2-}}&= \\frac{K_1 K_2}{\\ce{[H+]^2} + [\\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2} = \\frac{\\ce{[A^{2-}]}}{\\ce{{[H2A]}}+{[HA^-]}+{[A^{2-}]}}\n\\end{align}</math>\nA plot of these fractional concentrations against pH, for given ''K''<sub>1</sub> and ''K''<sub>2</sub>, is known as a [[Bjerrum plot]]. A pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general ''n'' -protic acid that has been deprotonated ''i'' -times:\n:<math chem>\n\\alpha_{\\ce H_{n-i} A^{i-} }= {{[\\ce{H+}]^{n-i} \\displaystyle \\prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \\over { \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=0}^n \\Big[ [\\ce{H+}]^{n-i} \\displaystyle \\prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \\Big] }\n</math>\n\nwhere ''K''<sub>0</sub> = 1 and the other K-terms are the dissociation constants for the acid.\n{{See also|Acid dissociation constant#Polyprotic acids}}\n\n===Neutralization===\n[[Image:Hydrochloric acid ammonia.jpg|thumb|[[Hydrochloric acid]] (in [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]]) reacting with [[ammonia]] fumes to produce [[ammonium chloride]] (white smoke).]]\n[[Neutralization (chemistry)|Neutralization]] is the reaction between an acid and a base, producing a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] and neutralized base; for example, [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sodium hydroxide]] form [[sodium chloride]] and water:\n:HCl<sub>(aq)</sub> + NaOH<sub>(aq)</sub> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> + NaCl<sub>(aq)</sub>\n\nNeutralization is the basis of [[titration]], where a [[pH indicator]] shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid. It is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with pH 7.0, which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction.\n\nNeutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt. An example is the weakly acidic [[ammonium chloride]], which is produced from the strong acid [[hydrogen chloride]] and the weak base [[ammonia]].

Sulfuric acid, a diprotic acid, is the most widely used acid in industry, which is also the most-produced industrial chemical in the world. It is mainly used in producing fertilizer, detergent, batteries and dyes, as well as used in processing many products such like removing impurities.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Top 10 Industrial Chemicals - For Dummies|url = http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/the-top-10-industrial-chemicals.html|website = www.dummies.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}</ref> According to the statistics data in 2011, the annual production of sulfuric acid was around 200 million tonnes in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sulfuric acid|url = http://www.essentialchemicalindustry.org/chemicals/sulfuric-acid.html|website = www.essentialchemicalindustry.org|access-date = 2016-02-06}}</ref> For example, phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce [[phosphoric acid]] for the production of phosphate fertilizers, and [[zinc]] is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid, purifying the solution and electrowinning.\n\nIn the chemical industry, acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts. For example, [[nitric acid]] reacts with [[ammonia]] to produce [[ammonium nitrate]], a fertilizer. Additionally, [[carboxylic acid]]s can be [[Esterification|esterified]] with alcohols, to produce [[ester]]s.\n\nAcids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as [[pickling (metal)|pickling]]. They may be used as an electrolyte in a [[wet cell battery]], such as [[sulfuric acid]] in a [[car battery]].\n\n===In food===\n[[File:Lata Coca Cola.JPG|thumb|Carbonated water (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> aqueous solution) is one of the  main ingredients listed the ingredient sheet of a can of Coca-Cola.]]\n[[Tartaric acid]] is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind. Natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids. [[Citric acid]] is present in oranges, lemon and other citrus fruits. [[Oxalic acid]] is present in tomatoes, spinach, and especially in [[carambola]] and [[rhubarb]]; rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid. [[Ascorbic acid]] (Vitamin C) is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla ([[Phyllanthus emblica|Indian gooseberry]]), lemon, citrus fruits, and guava.\n\nMany acids can be found in various kinds of food as additives, as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives. [[Phosphoric acid]], for example, is a component of [[cola]] drinks. [[Acetic acid]] is used in day-to-day life as vinegar. Citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles.\n\n[[Carbonic acid]] is one of the most common acid additive that is widely added in [[soft drink]]<nowiki/>s, such as [[Coca-Cola]]. During the manufacturing process of soft drinks, CO<sub>2</sub> is usually pressurized to dissolve in these drinks to generate carbonic acid.

[[Nucleic acid]]s, which contain acidic [[phosphate|phosphate groups]], include [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. Nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism's characteristics, and is passed from parents to offspring. DNA contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of [[protein]]s which are made up of [[amino acid]] subunits. [[Cell membrane]]s contain [[fatty acid]] [[ester]]s such as [[phospholipids]].\n\nAn \u03b1-amino acid has a central carbon (the \u03b1 or [[alpha and beta carbon|''alpha'' carbon]]) which is covalently bonded to a [[carboxyl]] group (thus they are [[carboxylic acid]]s), an [[amine|amino]] group, a hydrogen atom and a variable group. The variable group, also called the R group or side chain, determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid. In [[glycine]], the simplest amino acid, the R group is a hydrogen atom, but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens, and may contain other elements such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen. With the exception of glycine, naturally occurring amino acids are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] and almost invariably occur in the [[Chirality (chemistry)#By configuration: D- and L-|<small>L</small>-configuration]]. [[Peptidoglycan]], found in some bacterial [[cell wall]]s contains some <small>D</small>-amino acids. At physiological pH, typically around 7, free amino acids exist in a charged form, where the acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) loses a proton (-COO<sup>\u2212</sup>) and the basic amine group (-NH<sub>2</sub>) gains a proton (-NH{{su|b=3|p=+}}). The entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a [[zwitterion]], with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains. [[Aspartic acid]], for example, possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups, for a net charge of \u22121 at physiological pH.\n\nFatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology. These contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end. The cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a [[phospholipid bilayer]], a [[micelle]] of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar, hydrophilic [[phosphate]] \"head\" groups. Membranes contain additional components, some of which can participate in acid-base reactions.\n\nIn humans and many other animals, [[hydrochloric acid]] is a part of the [[gastric acid]] secreted within the [[stomach]] to help hydrolyze [[protein]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s, as well as converting the inactive pro-enzyme, [[pepsinogen]] into the [[digestive enzyme|enzyme]], [[pepsin]]. Some organisms produce acids for defense; for example, ants produce [[formic acid]].\n\nAcid-base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating [[mammal]]ian breathing. [[molecular oxygen|Oxygen]] gas (O<sub>2</sub>) drives [[cellular respiration]], the process by which animals release the chemical [[potential energy]] stored in food, producing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) as a byproduct. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the [[lungs]], and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. For example, during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored [[carbohydrate]]s and fat, releasing CO<sub>2</sub> into the blood stream. In aqueous solutions such as blood CO<sub>2</sub> exists in equilibrium with [[carbonic acid]] and [[bicarbonate]] ion.\n: CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + HCO{{su|b=3|p=\u2212}}\nIt is the decrease in pH that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper, expelling the excess CO<sub>2</sub> and resupplying the cells with O<sub>2</sub>.\n\n[[Image:Aspirin-skeletal.svg|thumb|right|[[Aspirin]] (acetylsalicylic acid) is a [[carboxylic acid]].]] [[Cell membrane]]s are generally impermeable to charged or large, polar molecules because of the [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] fatty acyl chains comprising their interior. Many biologically important molecules, including a number of pharmaceutical agents, are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated, uncharged form but not in their charged form (i.e. as the conjugate base). For this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods. The charged form, however, is often more soluble in blood and [[cytosol]], both aqueous environments. When the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral pH within the cell, certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer. Acids that lose a proton at the [[intracellular pH]] will exist in their soluble, charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target. [[Ibuprofen]], [[aspirin]] and [[penicillin]] are examples of drugs that are weak acids.\n\n==Common acids==\n\n===Mineral acids (inorganic acids)===\n* [[Hydrogen halides]] and their solutions: [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF), [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI)\n* Halogen oxoacids: [[hypochlorous acid]] (HClO), [[chlorous acid]] (HClO<sub>2</sub>), [[chloric acid]] (HClO<sub>3</sub>), [[perchloric acid]] (HClO<sub>4</sub>), and corresponding analogs for bromine and iodine\n** [[Hypofluorous acid]] (HFO), the only known oxoacid for fluorine.\n* [[Sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Fluorosulfuric acid]] (HSO<sub>3</sub>F)\n* [[Nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>)\n* [[Phosphoric acid]] (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Fluoroantimonic acid]] (HSbF<sub>6</sub>)\n* [[Fluoroboric acid]] (HBF<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Hexafluorophosphoric acid]] (HPF<sub>6</sub>)\n* [[Chromic acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Boric acid]] (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>)\n\n===Sulfonic acids===\nA [[sulfonic acid]] has the general formula RS(=O)<sub>2</sub>\u2013OH, where R is an organic radical.\n* [[Methanesulfonic acid]] (or mesylic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Ethanesulfonic acid]] (or esylic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Benzenesulfonic acid]] (or besylic acid, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[p-Toluenesulfonic acid]] (or tosylic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid]] (or triflic acid, CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Polystyrene sulfonic acid]] (sulfonated [[polystyrene]], [CH<sub>2</sub>CH(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)SO<sub>3</sub>H]<sub>n</sub>)\n\n===Carboxylic acids===\nA [[carboxylic acid]] has the general formula R-C(O)OH, where R is an organic radical.

An '''Arrhenius acid''' is a substance that, when added to water, increases the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions in the water.<ref name=\"Oxtoby8th\"/><ref name=\"Ebbing\">Ebbing, D.D., & Gammon, S.

Thus, an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water. Examples include molecular substances such as HCl and acetic acid.\n\nAn Arrhenius [[base (chemistry)|base]], on the other hand, is a substance which increases the concentration of [[hydroxide]] (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) ions when dissolved in water. This decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form H<sub>2</sub>O molecules:\n\nH<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + OH{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} \u21cc H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>\n\nDue to this equilibrium, any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide. Thus, an Arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration, while an Arrhenius base increases it.\n\nIn an acidic solution, the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10<sup>\u22127</sup> [[Mole (unit)|moles]] per liter.

Red: oxygen, black: carbon, white: hydrogen.]]\n\nWhile the Arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope. In 1923 chemists [[Johannes Nicolaus Br\u00f8nsted]] and [[Thomas Martin Lowry]] independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton. A '''Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid''' (or simply Br\u00f8nsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry base.<ref name=\"Ebbing\" /> Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over Arrhenius theory. Consider the following reactions of [[acetic acid]] (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH), the [[organic acid]] that gives vinegar its characteristic taste:\n\n:{{chem|CH|3|COOH}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} {{chem|CH|3|COO|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|3|O|+}}\n:{{chem|CH|3|COOH}} + {{chem|NH|3}} {{eqm}} {{chem|CH|3|COO|\u2212}} + {{chem|NH|4|+}}\n\nBoth theories easily describe the first reaction: CH<sub>3</sub>COOH acts as an Arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> when dissolved in water, and it acts as a Br\u00f8nsted acid by donating a proton to water. In the second example CH<sub>3</sub>COOH undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton to ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but does not relate to the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium. Nevertheless, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH is both an Arrhenius and a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid.\n\nBr\u00f8nsted-Lowry theory can be used to describe reactions of [[molecule|molecular compounds]] in nonaqueous solution or the gas phase. [[Hydrogen chloride]] (HCl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form [[ammonium chloride]], NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. In aqueous solution HCl behaves as [[hydrochloric acid]] and exists as hydronium and chloride ions. The following reactions illustrate the limitations of Arrhenius's definition:\n# H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + Cl{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} + NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Cl{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} + NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\n# HCl<sub>(benzene)</sub> + NH<sub>3(benzene)</sub> \u2192 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>(s)</sub>\n# HCl<sub>(g)</sub> + NH<sub>3(g)</sub> \u2192 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>(s)</sub>\n\nAs with the acetic acid reactions, both definitions work for the first example, where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the HCl solute. The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton-transfer reactions. In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in [[benzene]]) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and NH<sub>3</sub> combine to form the solid.\n\n===Lewis acids===\n{{main|Lewis acids and bases}}\nA third, only marginally related concept was proposed in 1923 by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer. A '''Lewis acid''' is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; in other words, it is an electron pair acceptor.<ref name=\"Ebbing\" /> Br\u00f8nsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while Lewis acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers. Many Lewis acids are not Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids. Contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acid-base chemistry:\n:[[File:LewisAcid.png|374px]]\nIn the first reaction a [[fluoride|fluoride ion]], F<sup>\u2212</sup>, gives up an [[lone pair|electron pair]] to [[boron trifluoride]] to form the product [[tetrafluoroborate]]. Fluoride \"loses\" a pair of [[valence electron]]s because the electrons shared in the B\u2014F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion. BF<sub>3</sub> is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride. This reaction cannot be described in terms of Br\u00f8nsted theory because there is no proton transfer. The second reaction can be described using either theory. A proton is transferred from an unspecified Br\u00f8nsted acid to ammonia, a Br\u00f8nsted base; alternatively, ammonia acts as a Lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion. The species that gains the electron pair is the Lewis acid; for example, the oxygen atom in H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> gains a pair of electrons when one of the H\u2014O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen. Depending on the context, a Lewis acid may also be described as an [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizer]] or an [[electrophile]]. Organic Br\u00f8nsted acids, such as acetic, citric, or oxalic acid, are not Lewis acids.<ref name=\"Oxtoby8th\" /> They dissociate in water to produce a Lewis acid, H<sup>+</sup>, but at the same time also yield an equal amount of a Lewis base (acetate, citrate, or oxalate, respectively, for the acids mentioned). Few, if any, of the acids discussed in the following are Lewis acids.\n\n==Dissociation and equilibrium==\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Free acid]] -->\nReactions of acids are often generalized in the form HA {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + A<sup>\u2212</sup>, where HA represents the acid and A<sup>\u2212</sup> is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]]. This reaction is referred to as '''protolysis'''. The protonated form (HA) of an acid is also sometimes referred to as the '''free acid'''.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last1 = Stahl | editor-first1 = P.

Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as HA<sup>+</sup> {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + A. In solution there exists an [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between the acid and its conjugate base. The [[equilibrium constant]] ''K'' is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution. Brackets indicate concentration, such that [H<sub>2</sub>O] means ''the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O''. The [[acid dissociation constant]] ''K''<sub>a</sub> is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions. The numerical value of ''K''<sub>a</sub> is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H<sup>+</sup>.\n:<math chem>K_a = \\frac\\ce{[H+] [A^{-}]}\\ce{[HA]}</math>\nThe stronger of two acids will have a higher ''K''<sub>a</sub> than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for ''K''<sub>a</sub> spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, p''K''<sub>a</sub> is more frequently used, where p''K''<sub>a</sub> = &minus;log<sub>10</sub> ''K''<sub>a</sub>. Stronger acids have a smaller p''K''<sub>a</sub> than weaker acids. Experimentally determined p''K''<sub>a</sub> at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nArrhenius acids are named according to their [[anion]]s. In the classical naming system, the ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix, according to the table following. The prefix \"hydro-\" is used when the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element. For example, HCl has [[chloride]] as its anion, so the hydro- prefix is used, and the -ide suffix makes the name take the form [[hydrochloric acid]].    \n\n''Classical naming system:''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Anion prefix\n!Anion suffix\n!Acid prefix\n!Acid suffix\n!Example\n|-\n|per\n|ate\n|per\n|ic acid\n|[[perchloric acid]] (HClO<sub>4</sub>)\n|-\n|\n|ate\n|\n|ic acid\n|[[chloric acid]] (HClO<sub>3</sub>)\n|-\n|\n|ite\n|\n|ous acid\n|[[chlorous acid]] (HClO<sub>2</sub>)\n|-\n|hypo\n|ite\n|hypo\n|ous acid\n|[[hypochlorous acid]] (HClO)\n|-\n|\n|ide\n|hydro\n|ic acid\n|[[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl)\n|}\n\nIn the [[IUPAC]] naming system, \"aqueous\" is simply added to the name of the ionic compound.    Thus, for hydrogen chloride, as an acid solution, the IUPAC name is aqueous hydrogen chloride.\n\n==Acid strength==\n{{main|Acid strength}}\n\nThe strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H<sup>+</sup> and one mole of the conjugate base, A<sup>\u2212</sup>, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of [[strong acid]]s are [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), [[perchloric acid]] (HClO<sub>4</sub>), [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>) and [[sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H<sup>+</sup>. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the [[chemical polarity|polarity]] of the H\u2014A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H\u2014A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.\n\nStronger acids have a larger ''K''<sub>a</sub> and a more negative p''K''<sub>a</sub> than weaker acids.\n\nSulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids. A common example is [[toluenesulfonic acid]] (tosylic acid). Unlike sulfuric acid itself, sulfonic acids can be solids. In fact, [[polystyrene]] functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.\n\n[[Superacid]]s are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid. Examples of superacids are [[fluoroantimonic acid]], [[magic acid]] and [[perchloric acid]]. Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline [[hydronium]] \"salts\". They can also quantitatively stabilize [[carbocation]]s.\n\nWhile ''K''<sub>a</sub> measures the strength of an acid compound, the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH, which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution.  The pH of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound's ''K''<sub>a</sub>.\n\n==Chemical characteristics==\n\n===Monoprotic acids===\nMonoprotic acids, also known as monobasic acids, are those acids that are able to donate one [[proton]] per molecule during the process of [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA):\n:HA<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a</sub>\n\nCommon examples of monoprotic acids in [[mineral acid]]s include [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>). On the other hand, for [[organic acids]] the term mainly indicates the presence of one [[carboxylic acid]] group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid. Examples in [[organic acids]] include [[formic acid]] (HCOOH), [[acetic acid]] (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) and [[benzoic acid]] (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COOH).\n{{See also|Acid dissociation constant#Monoprotic acids}}\n\n===Polyprotic acids===\nPolyprotic acids, also known as polybasic acids, are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule. Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as diprotic (or dibasic) acid (two potential protons to donate), and triprotic (or tribasic) acid (three potential protons to donate).\n\nA diprotic acid (here symbolized by H<sub>2</sub>A) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH. Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, K<sub>a1</sub> and K<sub>a2</sub>.\n:{{nowrap|H<sub>2</sub>A<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + HA{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a1</sub>}}\n:{{nowrap|HA{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=2\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a2</sub>}}\n\nThe first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., ''K''<sub>a1</sub> > ''K''<sub>a2</sub>. For example, [[sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) can donate one proton to form the [[bisulfate]] anion (HSO{{su|b=4|p=\u2212}}), for which ''K''<sub>a1</sub> is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the [[sulfate]] anion (SO{{su|b=4|p=2\u2212}}), wherein the ''K''<sub>a2</sub> is intermediate strength. The large ''K''<sub>a1</sub> for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid. In a similar manner, the weak unstable [[carbonic acid]] {{nowrap|(H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>)}} can lose one proton to form [[bicarbonate]] anion {{nowrap|(HCO{{su|b=3|p=\u2212}})}} and lose a second to form [[carbonate]] anion (CO{{su|b=3|p=2\u2212}}). Both ''K''<sub>a</sub> values are small, but ''K''<sub>a1</sub> > ''K''<sub>a2</sub> .\n\nA triprotic acid (H<sub>3</sub>A) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where ''K''<sub>a1</sub> > ''K''<sub>a2</sub> > ''K''<sub>a3</sub>.\n:{{nowrap|H<sub>3</sub>A<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>A{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a1</sub>}}\n:{{nowrap|H<sub>2</sub>A{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + HA{{su|p=2\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a2</sub>}}\n:{{nowrap|HA{{su|p=2\u2212|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=3\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ''K''<sub>a3</sub>}}\n\nAn [[inorganic]] example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), usually just called [[phosphoric acid]]. All three protons can be successively lost to yield H<sub>2</sub>PO{{su|b=4|p=\u2212}}, then HPO{{su|b=4|p=2\u2212}}, and finally PO{{su|b=4|p=3\u2212}}, the orthophosphate ion, usually just called [[phosphate]]. Even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent, the successive ''K''<sub>a</sub> values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged. An [[organic compound|organic]] example of a triprotic acid is [[citric acid]], which can successively lose three protons to finally form the [[citrate]] ion.\n\nAlthough the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable, all of the conjugate bases are present in solution. The fractional concentration, ''\u03b1'' (alpha), for each species can be calculated. For example, a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: H<sub>2</sub>A, HA<sup>\u2212</sup>, and A<sup>2\u2212</sup>. The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH (which can be converted to the [H<sup>+</sup>]) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases:\n:<math chem>\\begin{align}\n\\alpha_\\ce{H2A}   &= \\frac{\\ce{[H+]^2}}{\\ce{[H+]^2}  + [\\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2}  = \\frac{\\ce{[H2A]}}{\\ce{{[H2A]}} + [HA^-] + [A^{2-}]}\\\\ \n\\alpha_\\ce{HA^-}  &= \\frac{[\\ce{H+}]K_1}{\\ce{[H+]^2} + [\\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2}  = \\frac{\\ce{[HA^-]}}{\\ce{[H2A]}+{[HA^-]}+{[A^{2-}]}}\\\\\n\\alpha_\\ce{A^{2-}}&= \\frac{K_1 K_2}{\\ce{[H+]^2} + [\\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2} = \\frac{\\ce{[A^{2-}]}}{\\ce{{[H2A]}}+{[HA^-]}+{[A^{2-}]}}\n\\end{align}</math>\nA plot of these fractional concentrations against pH, for given ''K''<sub>1</sub> and ''K''<sub>2</sub>, is known as a [[Bjerrum plot]]. A pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general ''n'' -protic acid that has been deprotonated ''i'' -times:\n:<math chem>\n\\alpha_{\\ce H_{n-i} A^{i-} }= {{[\\ce{H+}]^{n-i} \\displaystyle \\prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \\over { \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=0}^n \\Big[ [\\ce{H+}]^{n-i} \\displaystyle \\prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \\Big] }\n</math>\n\nwhere ''K''<sub>0</sub> = 1 and the other K-terms are the dissociation constants for the acid.\n{{See also|Acid dissociation constant#Polyprotic acids}}\n\n===Neutralization===\n[[Image:Hydrochloric acid ammonia.jpg|thumb|[[Hydrochloric acid]] (in [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]]) reacting with [[ammonia]] fumes to produce [[ammonium chloride]] (white smoke).]]\n[[Neutralization (chemistry)|Neutralization]] is the reaction between an acid and a base, producing a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] and neutralized base; for example, [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sodium hydroxide]] form [[sodium chloride]] and water:\n:HCl<sub>(aq)</sub> + NaOH<sub>(aq)</sub> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> + NaCl<sub>(aq)</sub>\n\nNeutralization is the basis of [[titration]], where a [[pH indicator]] shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid. It is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with pH 7.0, which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction.\n\nNeutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt. An example is the weakly acidic [[ammonium chloride]], which is produced from the strong acid [[hydrogen chloride]] and the weak base [[ammonia]]. Conversely, neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt, e.g. [[sodium fluoride]] from [[hydrogen fluoride]] and [[sodium hydroxide]].\n\n===Weak acid\u2013weak base equilibrium===\n{{main|Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation}}\nIn order for a protonated acid to lose a proton, the pH of the system must rise above the p''K''<sub>a</sub> of the acid. The decreased concentration of H<sup>+</sup> in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form (the deprotonated form of the acid). In lower-pH (more acidic) solutions, there is a high enough H<sup>+</sup> concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form.\n\nSolutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form [[buffer solution]]s.\n\n== Titration ==\n{{main|Acid\u2013base titration}}\nTo determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution, an acid-base titration is commonly performed. A strong base solution with a known concentration, usually NaOH or KOH, is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Aqueous Acid-Base Equilibria and Titrations.|first = Robert|last = de Levie|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1999|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}</ref> The titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes, with the base volume on the x-axis and the solution's pH value on the y-axis.

Sulfuric acid, a diprotic acid, is the most widely used acid in industry, which is also the most-produced industrial chemical in the world. It is mainly used in producing fertilizer, detergent, batteries and dyes, as well as used in processing many products such like removing impurities.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Top 10 Industrial Chemicals - For Dummies|url = http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/the-top-10-industrial-chemicals.html|website = www.dummies.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}</ref> According to the statistics data in 2011, the annual production of sulfuric acid was around 200 million tonnes in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sulfuric acid|url = http://www.essentialchemicalindustry.org/chemicals/sulfuric-acid.html|website = www.essentialchemicalindustry.org|access-date = 2016-02-06}}</ref> For example, phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce [[phosphoric acid]] for the production of phosphate fertilizers, and [[zinc]] is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid, purifying the solution and electrowinning.\n\nIn the chemical industry, acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts.

[[Oxalic acid]] is present in tomatoes, spinach, and especially in [[carambola]] and [[rhubarb]]; rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid. [[Ascorbic acid]] (Vitamin C) is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla ([[Phyllanthus emblica|Indian gooseberry]]), lemon, citrus fruits, and guava.\n\nMany acids can be found in various kinds of food as additives, as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives.

The hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules. Amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues. Fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues. Nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of DNA and RNA and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes. Carbonic acid is important for maintenance of pH equilibrium in the body.\n\nHuman bodies contain a variety of organic and inorganic compounds, among those [[dicarboxylic acid]]s play an essential role in many biological behaviors. Many of those acids are [[amino acids]] which mainly serve as materials for the synthesis of proteins.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = 8 - Biological roles of amino acids and peptides - University Publishing Online|url = http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9781139163828&cid=CBO9781139163828A114|website = ebooks.cambridge.org|access-date = 2016-02-06|doi = 10.1017/CBO9781139163828}}</ref> Other weak acids serve as buffers with their conjugate bases to keep the body's pH from undergoing large scale changes which would be harmful to cells.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://fitsweb.uchc.edu/student/selectives/TimurGraham/Acid_Buffering.html|title = Acid Buffering|date = 2006|access-date = 2016-02-06|website = Acid Base Online Tutorial|publisher = University of Connecticut|last = Graham|first = Timur|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160213132105/http://fitsweb.uchc.edu/student/selectives/TimurGraham/Acid_Buffering.html|archive-date = 13 February 2016|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> The rest of the dicarboxylic acids also participate in the synthesis of various biologically important compounds in human bodies.\n\n===Acid catalysis===\n{{Main|Acid catalysis}}\nAcids are used as [[catalyst]]s in industrial and organic chemistry; for example, [[sulfuric acid]] is used in very large quantities in the [[alkylation]] process to produce gasoline.

[[Nucleic acid]]s, which contain acidic [[phosphate|phosphate groups]], include [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. Nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism's characteristics, and is passed from parents to offspring. DNA contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of [[protein]]s which are made up of [[amino acid]] subunits. [[Cell membrane]]s contain [[fatty acid]] [[ester]]s such as [[phospholipids]].\n\nAn \u03b1-amino acid has a central carbon (the \u03b1 or [[alpha and beta carbon|''alpha'' carbon]]) which is covalently bonded to a [[carboxyl]] group (thus they are [[carboxylic acid]]s), an [[amine|amino]] group, a hydrogen atom and a variable group. The variable group, also called the R group or side chain, determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid. In [[glycine]], the simplest amino acid, the R group is a hydrogen atom, but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens, and may contain other elements such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen. With the exception of glycine, naturally occurring amino acids are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] and almost invariably occur in the [[Chirality (chemistry)#By configuration: D- and L-|<small>L</small>-configuration]]. [[Peptidoglycan]], found in some bacterial [[cell wall]]s contains some <small>D</small>-amino acids. At physiological pH, typically around 7, free amino acids exist in a charged form, where the acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) loses a proton (-COO<sup>\u2212</sup>) and the basic amine group (-NH<sub>2</sub>) gains a proton (-NH{{su|b=3|p=+}}). The entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a [[zwitterion]], with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains. [[Aspartic acid]], for example, possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups, for a net charge of \u22121 at physiological pH.\n\nFatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology. These contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end. The cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a [[phospholipid bilayer]], a [[micelle]] of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar, hydrophilic [[phosphate]] \"head\" groups. Membranes contain additional components, some of which can participate in acid-base reactions.\n\nIn humans and many other animals, [[hydrochloric acid]] is a part of the [[gastric acid]] secreted within the [[stomach]] to help hydrolyze [[protein]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s, as well as converting the inactive pro-enzyme, [[pepsinogen]] into the [[digestive enzyme|enzyme]], [[pepsin]]. Some organisms produce acids for defense; for example, ants produce [[formic acid]].\n\nAcid-base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating [[mammal]]ian breathing. [[molecular oxygen|Oxygen]] gas (O<sub>2</sub>) drives [[cellular respiration]], the process by which animals release the chemical [[potential energy]] stored in food, producing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) as a byproduct. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the [[lungs]], and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. For example, during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored [[carbohydrate]]s and fat, releasing CO<sub>2</sub> into the blood stream. In aqueous solutions such as blood CO<sub>2</sub> exists in equilibrium with [[carbonic acid]] and [[bicarbonate]] ion.\n: CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + HCO{{su|b=3|p=\u2212}}\nIt is the decrease in pH that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper, expelling the excess CO<sub>2</sub> and resupplying the cells with O<sub>2</sub>.\n\n[[Image:Aspirin-skeletal.svg|thumb|right|[[Aspirin]] (acetylsalicylic acid) is a [[carboxylic acid]].]] [[Cell membrane]]s are generally impermeable to charged or large, polar molecules because of the [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] fatty acyl chains comprising their interior. Many biologically important molecules, including a number of pharmaceutical agents, are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated, uncharged form but not in their charged form (i.e. as the conjugate base). For this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods. The charged form, however, is often more soluble in blood and [[cytosol]], both aqueous environments. When the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral pH within the cell, certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer. Acids that lose a proton at the [[intracellular pH]] will exist in their soluble, charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target. [[Ibuprofen]], [[aspirin]] and [[penicillin]] are examples of drugs that are weak acids.\n\n==Common acids==\n\n===Mineral acids (inorganic acids)===\n* [[Hydrogen halides]] and their solutions: [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF), [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI)\n* Halogen oxoacids: [[hypochlorous acid]] (HClO), [[chlorous acid]] (HClO<sub>2</sub>), [[chloric acid]] (HClO<sub>3</sub>), [[perchloric acid]] (HClO<sub>4</sub>), and corresponding analogs for bromine and iodine\n** [[Hypofluorous acid]] (HFO), the only known oxoacid for fluorine.\n* [[Sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Fluorosulfuric acid]] (HSO<sub>3</sub>F)\n* [[Nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>)\n* [[Phosphoric acid]] (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Fluoroantimonic acid]] (HSbF<sub>6</sub>)\n* [[Fluoroboric acid]] (HBF<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Hexafluorophosphoric acid]] (HPF<sub>6</sub>)\n* [[Chromic acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Boric acid]] (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>)\n\n===Sulfonic acids===\nA [[sulfonic acid]] has the general formula RS(=O)<sub>2</sub>\u2013OH, where R is an organic radical.\n* [[Methanesulfonic acid]] (or mesylic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Ethanesulfonic acid]] (or esylic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Benzenesulfonic acid]] (or besylic acid, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[p-Toluenesulfonic acid]] (or tosylic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid]] (or triflic acid, CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Polystyrene sulfonic acid]] (sulfonated [[polystyrene]], [CH<sub>2</sub>CH(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)SO<sub>3</sub>H]<sub>n</sub>)\n\n===Carboxylic acids===\nA [[carboxylic acid]] has the general formula R-C(O)OH, where R is an organic radical.

Typically this involves vibrational energy being gained by a molecule as incident photons from a visible laser are shifted to lower energy. This is called normal Stokes Raman scattering. The effect is exploited by chemists and physicists to gain information about materials for a variety of purposes by performing various forms of [[Raman spectroscopy]]. Many other variants of Raman spectroscopy allow [[rotational energy]] to be examined (if gas samples are used) and [[Molecular electronic transition|electronic energy levels]] may be examined [[RIXS|if an X-ray source is used]] in addition to other possibilities. More complex techniques involving pulsed lasers, multiple laser beams and so on are known.\n\nLight has a certain probability of being scattered by a material. When photons are [[scattering|scattered]], most of them are [[elastic scattering|elastically scattered]] ([[Rayleigh scattering]]), such that the scattered photons have the same energy ([[frequency]], [[wavelength]] and color) as the incident photons but different direction. Rayleigh scattering usually has an intensity in the range 0.1% to 0.01% relative to that of a radiation source. An even smaller fraction of the scattered photons (approximately 1 in 10 million) can be scattered ''inelastically'', with the scattered photons having an energy different (usually lower) from those of the incident photons\u2014these are Raman scattered photons.<ref>{{cite book|author= Harris and Bertolucci|title=Symmetry and Spectroscopy|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1989|isbn= 978-0-486-66144-5}}</ref> Because of [[conservation of energy]], the material either gains or loses energy in the process.\n\nRayleigh scattering was discovered and explained in the 19th century. The Raman effect is named after Indian scientist [[C. V. Raman]], who discovered it in 1928 with assistance from his student [[K. S. Krishnan]]. Raman was awarded the Nobel prize in Physics in 1930 for his discovery although [[Grigory Landsberg]] and [[Leonid Mandelstam]] observed the effect in crystals the same year as Raman. The effect had been predicted theoretically by [[Adolf Smekal]] in 1923.\n\n== History ==\nThe elastic light scattering phenomena called Rayleigh scattering, in which light retains its energy, was described in the 19th century.

This number arises from the ability of each atom in a molecule to move in three dimensions.<ref name=Laidler>[[Keith J. Laidler]] and John H. Meiser, ''Physical Chemistry'' (Benjamin/Cummings 1982), pp.646-7 {{ISBN|0-8053-5682-7}}</ref> When dealing with molecules, it is more common to consider the movement of the molecule as a whole. Consequently, the 3{{mvar|N}} degrees of freedom are partitioned into molecular translational, [[rotational motion|rotational]], and vibrational motion. Three of the degrees of freedom correspond to translational motion of the molecule as a whole (along each of the three spatial dimensions). Similarly, three degrees of freedom correspond to rotations of the molecule about the <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, and <math>z</math>-axes. [[Linear molecular geometry|Linear molecule]]s only have two rotations because rotations along the bond axis do not change the positions of the atoms in the molecule. The remaining degrees of freedom correspond to molecular vibrational modes. These modes include stretching and bending motions of the [[chemical bond]]s of the molecule. For a linear molecule, the number of vibrational modes is 3{{mvar|N}}-5, whereas for a non-linear molecule the number of vibrational modes is 3{{mvar|N}}-6.<ref name=Laidler/>\n\n====Vibrational energy====\n{{main|Quantum harmonic oscillator}}\nMolecular vibrational energy is known to be quantized and can be modeled using the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] (QHO) approximation or a [[Dunham expansion]] when anharmonicity is important. \nThe vibrational energy levels according to the QHO are\n:<math>E_n = h \\left( n + {1 \\over 2 } \\right)\\nu=h\\left( n + {1 \\over 2 } \\right) {1\\over {2 \\pi}} \\sqrt{k \\over m} \\!</math>,\nwhere ''n'' is a quantum number. Since the selection rules for Raman and infrared absorption generally dictate that only fundamental vibrations are observed, infrared excitation or Stokes Raman excitation results in an energy change of <math>E=h \\nu={h\\over {2 \\pi}} \\sqrt{k \\over m}</math>\n\nThe energy range for vibrations is in the range of approximately 5 to 3500&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>. The fraction of molecules occupying a given vibrational mode at a given temperature follows a [[Boltzmann distribution]]. A molecule can be excited to a higher vibrational mode through the direct absorption of a photon of the appropriate energy, which falls in the terahertz or infrared range. This forms that basis of infrared spectroscopy. Alternatively, an inelastic scattering process may occur which leaves the molecule in the same vibrationally excited state. This is called Stokes Raman scattering, by analogy with the [[Stokes shift]] in [[fluorescence]] discovered by [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Stokes]] in 1852, with light emission at [[Stokes line|longer wavelength]] (now known to correspond to lower energy) than the absorbed incident light. Conceptually similar effects can be caused by [[Inelastic neutron scattering|neutrons]] or [[High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy|electrons]] rather than light.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krivanek|first=O.

Absorption of a photon excites the molecule to the imaginary state and re-emission leads to Raman or Rayleigh scattering. In all three cases the final state has the same electronic energy as the starting state but is higher in vibrational energy in the case of Stokes Raman scattering, lower in the case of anti-Stokes Raman scattering or the same in the case of Rayleigh scattering. Normally this is thought of in terms of wavenumbers, where <math>\\tilde{\\nu}_0</math> is the wavenumber of the laser and <math>\\tilde{\\nu}_M</math> is the wavenumber of the vibrational transition. Thus Stokes scattering gives a wavenumber of <math>\\tilde{\\nu}_0 - \\tilde{\\nu}_M</math> while <math display=\"inline\">\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\tilde{\\nu}_M</math> is given for anti-Stokes. When the exciting laser energy corresponds to an actual electronic excitation of the molecule then the [[Resonance Raman spectroscopy|resonance Raman]] effect occurs, but that is beyond the scope of this article.\n\nA classical physics based model is able to account for Raman scattering and predicts an increase in the intensity which scales with the fourth-power of the light frequency. Light scattering by a molecule is associated with oscillations of an induced electric dipole. The oscillating electric field component of electromagnetic radiation may bring about an induced dipole in a molecule which follows the alternating electric field which is modulated by the molecular vibrations. Oscillations at the external field frequency are therefore observed along with [[Beat frequency|beat frequencies]] resulting from the external field and normal mode vibrations.<ref name=\"Long\"/><ref name=\"Keresztury\" />\n\n[[File:Ramanscattering.svg|thumb|480px|The different possibilities of light scattering: Rayleigh scattering (no exchange of energy: incident and scattered photons have the same energy), Stokes Raman scattering (atom or molecule absorbs energy: scattered photon has less energy than the incident photon) and anti-Stokes Raman scattering (atom or molecule loses energy: scattered photon has more energy than the incident photon)]]\n\nThe spectrum of the scattered photons is termed the [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectrum]]. It shows the intensity of the scattered light as a function of its frequency difference ''\u0394\u03bd'' to the incident photons, more commonly called a Raman shift. The locations of corresponding Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks form a symmetric pattern around the Rayleigh''\u0394\u03bd=0'' line. The frequency shifts are symmetric because they correspond to the energy difference between the same upper and lower resonant states. The intensities of the pairs of features will typically differ, though. They depend on the populations of the initial states of the material, which in turn depend on the temperature. In [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the lower state will be more populated than the upper state. Therefore, the rate of transitions from the more populated lower state to the upper state (Stokes transitions) will be higher than in the opposite direction (anti-Stokes transitions). Correspondingly, Stokes scattering peaks are stronger than anti-Stokes scattering peaks.

A Raman transition from one state to another is allowed only if the molecular polarizability of those states is different. For a vibration, this means that the derivative of the polarizability with respect to the normal coordinate associated to the vibration is non-zero: <math>\\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial Q} \\ne 0</math>. In general, a normal mode is Raman active if it transforms with the same symmetry of the quadratic forms <math>(x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz)</math>, which can be verified from the [[character table]] of the molecule's point group. As with IR spectroscopy, only fundamental excitations (<math>\\Delta\\nu=\\pm1</math>) are allowed according to the QHO. There are however many cases where overtones are observed. The [[rule of mutual exclusion]], which states that vibrational modes cannot be both IR and Raman active, applies to certain molecules.\n\nThe specific selection rules state that the allowed rotational transitions are <math>\\Delta J=\\pm2</math>, where <math>J</math> is the rotational state. This generally is only relevant to molecules in the gas phase where the Raman linewidths are small enough for rotational transitions to be resolved.\n\nA selection rule relevant only to ordered solid materials states that only phonons with zero phase angle can be observed by IR and Raman, except when [[Quantum confinement|phonon confinement]] is manifest.<ref name=\"Everall\" />\n\n===Symmetry and polarization===\n{{main|Depolarization ratio}}\nMonitoring the polarization of the scattered photons is useful for understanding the connections between [[molecular symmetry]] and Raman activity which may assist in assigning peaks in Raman spectra.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Itoh|first1=Yuki|last2=Hasegawa|first2=Takeshi|title=Polarization Dependence of Raman Scattering from a Thin Film Involving Optical Anisotropy Theorized for Molecular Orientation Analysis|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry A|date=May 2, 2012|doi=10.1021/jp301070a|pmid=22551093|volume=116|issue=23 |pages=5560\u20135570|bibcode=2012JPCA..116.5560I}}</ref> Light polarized in a single direction only gives access to some Raman\u2013active modes, but rotating the polarization gives access to other modes.

This process is thus called ''spontaneous Raman scattering''.\n\nOn the other hand, ''stimulated Raman scattering'' can take place when some Stokes photons have previously been generated by spontaneous Raman scattering (and somehow forced to remain in the material), or when deliberately injecting Stokes photons (\"signal light\") together with the original light (\"pump light\"). In that case, the total Raman-scattering rate is increased beyond that of spontaneous Raman scattering: pump photons are converted more rapidly into additional Stokes photons. The more Stokes photons that are already present, the faster more of them are added. Effectively, this ''amplifies'' the Stokes light in the presence of the pump light, which is exploited in [[Optical amplifier#Raman amplifier|Raman amplifiers]] and [[Raman laser]]s.\n\nStimulated Raman scattering is a [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] effect. It can be described using a third-order [[nonlinear susceptibility]] <math>\\chi^{(3)}</math>.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Requirement for space-coherence ===\nSuppose that the distance between two points A and B of an exciting beam is {{math|''x''}}. Generally, as the exciting frequency is not equal to the scattered Raman frequency, the corresponding relative wavelengths {{math|&lambda;}} and {{math|&lambda;'}} are not equal. Thus, a phase-shift {{math|&Theta; {{=}} 2&pi;''x''(1/&lambda; \u2212 1/&lambda;')}} appears.

If energy may be transferred between these modes by a quadrupolar (Raman) resonance, phases remain coherent along the whole path, transfer of energy may be large. It is an [[Optical parametric generation]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n* Light may be pulsed, so that beats do not appear.

J. Jones and [[B.P. Stoicheff]]. In some circumstances, Stokes scattering can exceed anti-Stokes scattering; in these cases the continuum (on leaving the material) is observed to have an absorption line (a dip in intensity) at \u03bd<sub>''L''</sub>+\u03bd<sub>''M''</sub>.  This phenomenon is referred to as the ''inverse Raman effect''; the application of the phenomenon is referred to as ''inverse [[Raman spectroscopy]]'', and a record of the continuum is referred to as an ''inverse Raman spectrum''.\n\nIn the original description of the inverse Raman effect,<ref name=\"J&S\">{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=W.

They note that absorption from a continuum of lower frequencies will not be observed if the Raman frequency of the material is vibrational in origin and if the material is in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium#Thermal equilibrium|thermal equilibrium]].\n\n=== Supercontinuum generation ===\nFor high-intensity continuous wave (CW) lasers, stimulated Raman scattering can be used to produce a broad bandwidth [[supercontinuum]]. This process can also be seen as a special case of [[four-wave mixing]], wherein the frequencies of the two incident photons are equal and the emitted spectra are found in two bands separated from the incident light by the [[phonon]] energies. The initial Raman spectrum is built up with spontaneous emission and is amplified later on. At high pumping levels in long fibers, higher-order Raman spectra can be generated by using the Raman spectrum as a new starting point, thereby building a chain of new spectra with decreasing amplitude. The disadvantage of intrinsic noise due to the initial spontaneous process can be overcome by seeding a spectrum at the beginning, or even using a feedback loop as in a resonator to stabilize the process. Since this technology easily fits into the fast evolving [[fiber laser]] field and there is demand for transversal coherent high-intensity light sources (i.e., broadband telecommunication, imaging applications), Raman amplification and spectrum generation might be widely used in the near-future.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Applications==\n{{main|Raman spectroscopy#Applications}}\n[[Raman spectroscopy]] employs the Raman effect for substances analysis.

Typically this involves vibrational energy being gained by a molecule as incident photons from a visible laser are shifted to lower energy. This is called normal Stokes Raman scattering. The effect is exploited by chemists and physicists to gain information about materials for a variety of purposes by performing various forms of [[Raman spectroscopy]]. Many other variants of Raman spectroscopy allow [[rotational energy]] to be examined (if gas samples are used) and [[Molecular electronic transition|electronic energy levels]] may be examined [[RIXS|if an X-ray source is used]] in addition to other possibilities. More complex techniques involving pulsed lasers, multiple laser beams and so on are known.\n\nLight has a certain probability of being scattered by a material. When photons are [[scattering|scattered]], most of them are [[elastic scattering|elastically scattered]] ([[Rayleigh scattering]]), such that the scattered photons have the same energy ([[frequency]], [[wavelength]] and color) as the incident photons but different direction. Rayleigh scattering usually has an intensity in the range 0.1% to 0.01% relative to that of a radiation source. An even smaller fraction of the scattered photons (approximately 1 in 10 million) can be scattered ''inelastically'', with the scattered photons having an energy different (usually lower) from those of the incident photons\u2014these are Raman scattered photons.<ref>{{cite book|author= Harris and Bertolucci|title=Symmetry and Spectroscopy|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1989|isbn= 978-0-486-66144-5}}</ref> Because of [[conservation of energy]], the material either gains or loses energy in the process. \n\nRayleigh scattering was discovered and explained in the 19th century.

This number arises from the ability of each atom in a molecule to move in three dimensions.<ref name=Laidler>[[Keith J. Laidler]] and John H. Meiser, ''Physical Chemistry'' (Benjamin/Cummings 1982), pp.646-7 {{ISBN|0-8053-5682-7}}</ref> When dealing with molecules, it is more common to consider the movement of the molecule as a whole. Consequently, the 3{{mvar|N}} degrees of freedom are partitioned into molecular translational, [[rotational motion|rotational]], and vibrational motion. Three of the degrees of freedom correspond to translational motion of the molecule as a whole (along each of the three spatial dimensions). Similarly, three degrees of freedom correspond to rotations of the molecule about the <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, and <math>z</math>-axes. [[Linear molecular geometry|Linear molecule]]s only have two rotations because rotations along the bond axis do not change the positions of the atoms in the molecule. The remaining degrees of freedom correspond to molecular vibrational modes. These modes include stretching and bending motions of the [[chemical bond]]s of the molecule. For a linear molecule, the number of vibrational modes is 3{{mvar|N}}-5, whereas for a non-linear molecule the number of vibrational modes is 3{{mvar|N}}-6.<ref name=Laidler/>\n\n====Vibrational energy====\n{{main|Quantum harmonic oscillator}}\nMolecular vibrational energy is known to be quantized and can be modeled using the [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] (QHO) approximation or a [[Dunham expansion]] when anharmonicity is important. \nThe vibrational energy levels according to the QHO are\n:<math>E_n = h \\left( n + {1 \\over 2 } \\right)\\nu=h\\left( n + {1 \\over 2 } \\right) {1\\over {2 \\pi}} \\sqrt{k \\over m} \\!</math>,\nwhere ''n'' is a quantum number. Since the selection rules for Raman and infrared absorption generally dictate that only fundamental vibrations are observed, infrared excitation or Stokes Raman excitation results in an energy change of <math>E=h \\nu={h\\over {2 \\pi}} \\sqrt{k \\over m}</math>\n\nThe energy range for vibrations is in the range of approximately 5 to 3500 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The fraction of molecules occupying a given vibrational mode at a given temperature follows a [[Boltzmann distribution]]. A molecule can be excited to a higher vibrational mode through the direct absorption of a photon of the appropriate energy, which falls in the terahertz or infrared range. This forms that basis of infrared spectroscopy. Alternatively, an inelastic scattering process may occur which leaves the molecule in the same vibrationally excited state. This is called Stokes Raman scattering, by analogy with the [[Stokes shift]] in [[fluorescence]] discovered by [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Stokes]] in 1852, with light emission at [[Stokes line|longer wavelength]] (now known to correspond to lower energy) than the absorbed incident light. Conceptually similar effects can be caused by [[Inelastic neutron scattering|neutrons]] or [[High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy|electrons]] rather than light.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krivanek|first=O.

Absorption of a photon excites the molecule to the imaginary state and re-emission leads to Raman or Rayleigh scattering. In all three cases the final state has the same electronic energy as the starting state but is higher in vibrational energy in the case of Stokes Raman scattering, lower in the case of anti-Stokes Raman scattering or the same in the case of Rayleigh scattering. Normally this is thought of in terms of wavenumbers, where <math>\\tilde{\\nu}_0</math> is the wavenumber of the laser and <math>\\tilde{\\nu}_M</math> is the wavenumber of the vibrational transition. Thus Stokes scattering gives a wavenumber of <math>\\tilde{\\nu}_0 - \\tilde{\\nu}_M</math> while <math display=\"inline\">\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\tilde{\\nu}_M</math> is given for anti-Stokes. When the exciting laser energy corresponds to an actual electronic excitation of the molecule then the [[Resonance Raman spectroscopy|resonance Raman]] effect occurs, but that is beyond the scope of this article. \n\nA classical physics based model is able to account for Raman scattering and predicts an increase in the intensity which scales with the fourth-power of the light frequency. Light scattering by a molecule is associated with oscillations of an induced electric dipole. The oscillating electric field component of electromagnetic radiation may bring about an induced dipole in a molecule which follows the alternating electric field which is modulated by the molecular vibrations. Oscillations at the external field frequency are therefore observed along with [[Beat frequency|beat frequencies]] resulting from the external field and normal mode vibrations.<ref name=\"Long\">{{cite book |last1=Long |first1=Derek A. |title=The Raman Effect |date=2002 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd |isbn=978-0471490289 |language=en|doi=10.1002/0470845767 }}</ref><ref name=\"Keresztury\" />\n\n[[File:Ramanscattering.svg|thumb|480px|The different possibilities of light scattering: Rayleigh scattering (no exchange of energy: incident and scattered photons have the same energy), Stokes Raman scattering (atom or molecule absorbs energy: scattered photon has less energy than the incident photon) and anti-Stokes Raman scattering (atom or molecule loses energy: scattered photon has more energy than the incident photon)]]\n\nThe spectrum of the scattered photons is termed the [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectrum]]. It shows the intensity of the scattered light as a function of its frequency difference ''\u0394\u03bd'' to the incident photons, more commonly called a Raman shift. The locations of corresponding Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks form a symmetric pattern around the Rayleigh''\u0394\u03bd=0'' line. The frequency shifts are symmetric because they correspond to the energy difference between the same upper and lower resonant states. The intensities of the pairs of features will typically differ, though. They depend on the populations of the initial states of the material, which in turn depend on the temperature. In [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the lower state will be more populated than the upper state. Therefore, the rate of transitions from the more populated lower state to the upper state (Stokes transitions) will be higher than in the opposite direction (anti-Stokes transitions). Correspondingly, Stokes scattering peaks are stronger than anti-Stokes scattering peaks. Their ratio depends on the temperature, and can therefore be exploited to measure it:\n:<math>\\frac{I_\\text{Stokes}}{I_\\text{anti-Stokes}} = \\frac{(\\tilde{\\nu}_0 - \\tilde{\\nu}_M)^4}{(\\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\tilde{\\nu}_M)^4}\\exp \n\\left(\\frac{hc \\,\\tilde{\\nu}_M}{k_BT}\\right)</math>\n\n===Selection rules===\nIn contrast to IR spectroscopy, where there is a requirement for a change in dipole moment for vibrational excitation to take place, Raman scattering requires a change in polarizability. A Raman transition from one state to another is allowed only if the molecular polarizability of those states is different. For a vibration, this means that the derivative of the polarizability with respect to the normal coordinate associated to the vibration is non-zero: <math>\\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial Q} \\ne 0</math>. In general, a normal mode is Raman active if it transforms with the same symmetry of the quadratic forms <math>(x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz)</math>, which can be verified from the [[character table]] of the molecule's point group. As with IR spectroscopy, only fundamental excitations (<math>\\Delta\\nu=\\pm1</math>) are allowed according to the QHO. There are however many cases where overtones are observed. The [[rule of mutual exclusion]], which states that vibrational modes cannot be both IR and Raman active, applies to certain molecules.\n\nThe specific selection rules state that the allowed rotational transitions are <math>\\Delta J=\\pm2</math>, where <math>J</math> is the rotational state. This generally is only relevant to molecules in the gas phase where the Raman linewidths are small enough for rotational transitions to be resolved.\n\nA selection rule relevant only to ordered solid materials states that only phonons with zero phase angle can be observed by IR and Raman, except when [[Quantum confinement|phonon confinement]] is manifest.<ref name=\"Everall\" />\n\n===Symmetry and polarization===\n{{main|Depolarization ratio}}\nMonitoring the polarization of the scattered photons is useful for understanding the connections between [[molecular symmetry]] and Raman activity which may assist in assigning peaks in Raman spectra.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Itoh|first1=Yuki|last2=Hasegawa|first2=Takeshi|title=Polarization Dependence of Raman Scattering from a Thin Film Involving Optical Anisotropy Theorized for Molecular Orientation Analysis|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry A|date=May 2, 2012|doi=10.1021/jp301070a|pmid=22551093|volume=116|issue=23 |pages=5560\u20135570|bibcode=2012JPCA..116.5560I}}</ref> Light polarized in a single direction only gives access to some Raman\u2013active modes, but rotating the polarization gives access to other modes.

This process is thus called ''spontaneous Raman scattering''.\n\nOn the other hand, ''stimulated Raman scattering'' can take place when some Stokes photons have previously been generated by spontaneous Raman scattering (and somehow forced to remain in the material), or when deliberately injecting Stokes photons (\"signal light\") together with the original light (\"pump light\"). In that case, the total Raman-scattering rate is increased beyond that of spontaneous Raman scattering: pump photons are converted more rapidly into additional Stokes photons. The more Stokes photons that are already present, the faster more of them are added. Effectively, this ''amplifies'' the Stokes light in the presence of the pump light, which is exploited in [[Optical amplifier#Raman amplifier|Raman amplifiers]] and [[Raman laser]]s.\n\nStimulated Raman scattering is a [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] effect. It can be described using a third-order [[nonlinear susceptibility]] <math>\\chi^{(3)}</math>.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Requirement for space-coherence ===\nSuppose that the distance between two points A and B of an exciting beam is {{math|''x''}}. Generally, as the exciting frequency is not equal to the scattered Raman frequency, the corresponding relative wavelengths {{math|&lambda;}} and {{math|&lambda;'}} are not equal. Thus, a phase-shift {{math|&Theta; {{=}} 2&pi;''x''(1/&lambda; \u2212 1/&lambda;')}} appears. For {{math|&Theta; {{=}} ''&pi;''}}, the scattered amplitudes are opposite, so that the Raman scattered beam remains weak.\n\n* A crossing of the beams may limit the path {{math|''x''}}.\n\nSeveral tricks may be used to get a larger amplitude:\n\n* In an optically anisotropic crystal, a light ray may have two modes of propagation with different polarizations and different indices of refraction. If energy may be transferred between these modes by a quadrupolar (Raman) resonance, phases remain coherent along the whole path, transfer of energy may be large. It is an [[Optical parametric generation]].{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n* Light may be pulsed, so that beats do not appear.

J. Jones and [[B.P. Stoicheff]]. In some circumstances, Stokes scattering can exceed anti-Stokes scattering; in these cases the continuum (on leaving the material) is observed to have an absorption line (a dip in intensity) at \u03bd<sub>''L''</sub>+\u03bd<sub>''M''</sub>.  This phenomenon is referred to as the ''inverse Raman effect''; the application of the phenomenon is referred to as ''inverse [[Raman spectroscopy]]'', and a record of the continuum is referred to as an ''inverse Raman spectrum''.\n\nIn the original description of the inverse Raman effect,<ref name=\"J&S\">{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=W.

They note that absorption from a continuum of lower frequencies will not be observed if the Raman frequency of the material is vibrational in origin and if the material is in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium#Thermal equilibrium|thermal equilibrium]].\n\n=== Supercontinuum generation ===\nFor high-intensity continuous wave (CW) lasers, stimulated Raman scattering can be used to produce a broad bandwidth [[supercontinuum]]. This process can also be seen as a special case of [[four-wave mixing]], wherein the frequencies of the two incident photons are equal and the emitted spectra are found in two bands separated from the incident light by the [[phonon]] energies. The initial Raman spectrum is built up with spontaneous emission and is amplified later on. At high pumping levels in long fibers, higher-order Raman spectra can be generated by using the Raman spectrum as a new starting point, thereby building a chain of new spectra with decreasing amplitude. The disadvantage of intrinsic noise due to the initial spontaneous process can be overcome by seeding a spectrum at the beginning, or even using a feedback loop as in a resonator to stabilize the process. Since this technology easily fits into the fast evolving [[fiber laser]] field and there is demand for transversal coherent high-intensity light sources (i.e., broadband telecommunication, imaging applications), Raman amplification and spectrum generation might be widely used in the near-future.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Applications==\n{{main|Raman spectroscopy#Applications}}\n[[Raman spectroscopy]] employs the Raman effect for substances analysis. The spectrum of the Raman-scattered light depends on the molecular constituents present and their state, allowing the spectrum to be used for material identification and analysis. Raman spectroscopy is used to analyze a wide range of materials, including gases, liquids, and solids.

In particular, the word usually refers to a Japanese word of foreign origin that was not borrowed in ancient times from Old or Middle [[Chinese language|Chinese]], but in modern times, primarily from [[English language|English]] or other European languages. These are primarily written in the [[katakana]] phonetic script, with a few older terms written in Chinese characters ([[kanji]]); the latter are known as [[ateji]].\n\nJapanese has a large number of [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|loan words from Chinese]], accounting for a sizeable fraction of the language. These words were borrowed during ancient times and are written in ''kanji''. Modern Chinese loanwords are generally considered ''gairaigo'' and written in ''katakana'', or sometimes written in ''kanji'' (either with the more familiar word as a base text gloss and the intended ''katakana'' as [[furigana]] or vice versa); pronunciation of modern Chinese loanwords generally differs from the corresponding usual pronunciation of the characters in Japanese.\n\nFor a list of terms, see the [[List of gairaigo and wasei-eigo terms]].\n\n== Source languages ==\nJapanese has a long history of borrowing from foreign languages. It has been doing so since the late fourth century A.D. Some ancient ''gairaigo'' words are still being used nowadays, but there are also many kinds of ''gairaigo'' words that were borrowed more recently.\n\nMost, but not all, modern ''gairaigo'' are derived from [[English language|English]], particularly in the post-World War II era (after 1945). Words are taken from English for concepts that do not exist in Japanese, but also for other reasons, such as a preference for English terms or fashionability \u2013 many ''gairaigo'' have Japanese near-synonyms.\n\nIn the past, more ''gairaigo'' came from other languages besides English. The first period of borrowing occurred during the late fourth century A.D., when a massive number of Chinese characters were adopted. This period could be considered as one of the most significant in the history of ''gairaigo'', because it was the first moment when the written communication systems using ''kanji'' were formed.\n\nThe first non-Asian countries to have extensive contact with Japan were [[Portugal]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Japanese has several loanwords from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], many of which are still used. The interaction between Japan and Portugal lasted from the late middle age until the early Edo era. (1549-1638). An example of the loanwords from Portuguese is ''rasha'', meaning a thick wool cloth that was indispensable during the period, but not used often nowadays. In the Edo era (1603-1853), words from the Dutch language, such as ''glas'', ''gas'', and ''alcohol'', started to have an impact in the Japanese language. Also, during the Edo era, many medical words like ''Gaze'' (meaning [[gauze]]) and ''neuroses'' came from German, and many artistic words such as ''rouge'' and ''dessin'' came from French. Most of the ''gairaigo'' since the nineteenth century came from English.\n\nIn the [[Meiji era]] (late 19th to early 20th century), Japan also had extensive contact with [[Germany]], and gained many loanwords from [[German language|German]], particularly for Western medicine, which the Japanese learned from the Germans. Notable examples include {{Nihongo||[[wikt:\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8]]|arubaito|part-time work}} (often abbreviated to {{Nihongo||\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8|baito}}) from German ''[[wikt:Arbeit|Arbeit]]'' (\"work\"), and {{Nihongo||[[wikt:\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc|\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc]]|enerug\u012b|energy}} from German ''[[wikt:Energie|Energie]]''. They also gained several loanwords from [[French language|French]] at this time.\n\nIn modern times, there are some borrowings from Modern Chinese and Modern Korean, particularly for food names, and these continue as new foods become popular in Japan; standard examples include ''\u016bron'' (\u70cf\u9f8d \u30a6\u30fc\u30ed\u30f3 \"[[oolong]] tea\") and ''kimuchi'' (\u30ad\u30e0\u30c1 \"[[kimchi]]\"), respectively, while more specialized examples include ''hoik\u014dr\u014d'' ([[:ja:\u56de\u934b\u8089|\u56de\u934b\u8089]] \u30db\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc \"[[twice cooked pork]]\") from Chinese, and ''bibinba'' ([[:ja:\u30d3\u30d3\u30f3\u30d0|\u30d3\u30d3\u30f3\u30d0]] \"[[bibimbap]]\") from Korean. Chinese words are often represented with Chinese characters, but with ''katakana'' gloss to indicate the unusual pronunciation, while Korean words, which no longer regularly use Chinese characters (''[[hanja]]''), are represented in ''katakana''. There is sometimes ambiguity in pronunciation of these borrowings, particularly voicing, such as ''to'' (\u30c8) vs. ''do'' (\u30c9)  \u2013 compare English's [[Daoism\u2013Taoism romanization issue]].\n\nSome Modern Chinese borrowings occurred during the 17th and 18th centuries, due both to trade and resident Chinese in [[Nagasaki]], and a more recent wave of Buddhist monks, the [[\u014cbaku]] school, whose words are derived from languages spoken in [[Fujian]]. More recent Korean borrowings are influenced both by proximity, and to the substantial population of [[Koreans in Japan]] since the early 20th century.\n\nIn 1889, there were 85 ''gairaigo'' of Dutch origin and 72 ''gairaigo'' of English origin listed in a Japanese dictionary.{{which|date=July 2018}}{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} From 1911 to 1924, 51% of ''gairaigo'' listed in dictionaries were of English origin, and today, 80% to 90% of ''gairaigo'' are of English origin.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThere have been some borrowings from [[Sanskrit]] as well, most notably for religious terms. These words are generally transliterations which were unknowingly borrowed from Chinese.<ref>[https://www.nichirenlibrary.org \"Sanskrit Names And Their Japanese Equivalents\" ]</ref>\n\n;Cognates\nIn some cases, [[cognate]]s or etymologically related words from different languages may be borrowed and sometimes used synonymously or sometimes used distinctly.\n\nThe most common basic example is {{Nihongo||[[wikt:\u30ab\u30c3\u30d7|\u30ab\u30c3\u30d7]]|kappu|\"cup (with handle), mug\"|from English ''[[wikt:cup|cup]]''}} versus earlier {{Nihongo||[[wikt:\u30b3\u30c3\u30d7|\u30b3\u30c3\u30d7]]|koppu|\"cup (without handle), tumbler\"|from Dutch ''[[wikt:kop|kop]]'' or Portuguese ''[[wikt:copo|copo]]''}}, where they are used distinctly. A more technical example is {{Nihongo||[[:ja:\u30bd\u30eb\u30d3\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb|\u30bd\u30eb\u30d3\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb]]|sorubit\u014dru}} (English ''[[sorbitol]]'') versus {{Nihongo||\u30bd\u30eb\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8|sorubitto}} (German ''[[:de:Sorbit|Sorbit]]''), used synonymously.\n\n;''Wasei-kango''\nIn addition to borrowings, which adopted both meaning and pronunciation, Japanese also has an extensive set of new words that are crafted using existing Chinese morphemes to express a foreign term. These are known as ''[[wasei-kango]]'' \"Japanese-made Chinese words\". This process is similar to the creation of [[classical compound]]s in European languages. Many were coined in the Meiji period, and these are very common in medical terminology. These are not considered ''gairaigo'', as the foreign word itself has not been borrowed, and sometimes a translation and a borrowing are both used.\n\n== Writing ==\n{{main article|Transcription into Japanese}}\nIn [[Japanese writing system|written Japanese]], ''gairaigo'' are usually written in ''[[katakana]]''.  Older loanwords are also often written using ''[[ateji]]'' (''[[kanji]]'' chosen for their phonetic value, or sometimes for meaning instead) or [[hiragana]], for example ''tabaco'' from Portuguese, meaning \"tobacco\" or \"cigarette\" can be written {{lang|ja|\u30bf\u30d0\u30b3}} (''katakana''), {{lang|ja|\u305f\u3070\u3053}} (''hiragana''), or {{lang|ja|\u7159\u8349}} (the ''kanji'' for \"smoke grass\", but still pronounced \"tabako\" \u2013 meaning-''ateji''), with no change in meaning. Another common older example is ''[[tempura]],'' which is usually written in mixed ''kanji''/''kana'' ([[mazegaki]]) as {{lang|ja|\u5929\u3077\u3089}}, but is also written as {{lang|ja|\u3066\u3093\u3077\u3089, \u30c6\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9, \u5929\u9ea9\u7f85}} (rare kanji) or {{lang|ja|\u5929\u5a66\u7f85}} (common kanji) \u2013 here it is sound-''ateji,'' with the characters used for sound value only.\n\nFew ''gairaigo'' are sometimes written with a single ''kanji'' character (chosen for meaning or newly created); consequently, these are considered ''[[kun'yomi]]'' rather than ''ateji'' because the single characters are used for meaning rather than for sound and are often written as katakana. An example is {{nihongo||\u9801\u3001\u30da\u30fc\u30b8|p\u0113ji|page}}; see [[Ateji#Single-character loan words|single-character loan words]] for details.\n\n==False friends and ''wasei-eigo''==\nThere are numerous causes for confusion in ''gairaigo'': (1) ''gairaigo'' are often abbreviated, (2) their meaning may change (either in Japanese or in the original language after the borrowing has occurred), (3) many words are not borrowed but rather coined in Japanese (''[[wasei-eigo]]'' \"English made in Japan\"), and (4) not all ''gairaigo'' come from English.\n\nDue to Japanese pronunciation rules and its [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]-based phonology, many words take a significant amount of time to pronounce. For example, a one-syllable word in a language such as English (''brake'') often becomes several syllables when pronounced in Japanese (in this case, ''bur\u0113ki'' ({{lang|ja|\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad}}), which amounts to four moras). The Japanese language, therefore, contains many [[Japanese abbreviated and contracted words|abbreviated and contracted words]], and there is a strong tendency to shorten words. This also occurs with ''gairaigo'' words. For example, \"remote control\", when transcribed in Japanese, becomes ''rim\u014dto kontor\u014dru'' ({{lang|ja|\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb}}), but this has then been simplified to ''rimokon'' ({{lang|ja|\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3}}). For another example, the transcribed word for \"department store\" is ''dep\u0101tomento sutoa'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c7\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2}}) but has since been shortened to ''dep\u0101to'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c7\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8}}). [[Clipped compound]]s, such as ''w\u0101puro'' ({{lang|ja|\u30ef\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed}}) for \"word processor\", are common. ''[[Karaoke]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u30ab\u30e9\u30aa\u30b1}}), a combination of the Japanese word ''kara'' \"empty\" and the clipped form, ''oke'', of the English loanword \"orchestra\" (J. ''\u014dkesutora'' {{lang|ja|\u30aa\u30fc\u30b1\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9}}), is a clipped compound that has entered the English language. Japanese ordinarily takes the first part of a foreign word, but in some cases the second syllable is used instead; notable examples from English include {{Nihongo||\u30db\u30fc\u30e0|h\u014dmu|from \"(train station) plat-form\"}} and {{Nihongo||\u30cd\u30eb\u30b7\u30e3\u30c4|nerushatsu|\"flan-nel\"}}.\n\nSome Japanese people are not aware of the origins of the words in their language, and may assume that all ''gairaigo'' words are legitimate English words. For example, Japanese people may use words like ''t\u0113ma'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c6\u30fc\u30de}}, from German ''Thema'', meaning \"topic/theme\") in English, or ''rimokon'', not realizing that the contraction of \"remote control\" to ''rimokon'' took place in Japan.\n\nSimilarly, ''gairaigo'', while making Japanese easier to learn for foreign students in some cases, can also cause problems due to independent [[semantic progression]]. For example, English \"stove\", from which ''sut\u014dbu'' ({{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30d6}}) is derived, has multiple meanings. Americans often use the word to mean a cooking appliance, and are thus surprised when Japanese take it to mean a space heater (such as a wood-burning stove). The Japanese term for a cooking stove is another ''gairaigo'' term, ''renji'' ({{lang|ja|\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8}}), from the English \"range\"; a gas stove is a ''gasurenji'' ({{lang|ja|\u30ac\u30b9\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8}}).\n\nAdditionally, Japanese combines words in ways that are uncommon in English. As an example, ''left over'' is a [[baseball]] term for a hit that goes over the left-fielder's head rather than uneaten food saved for a later meal. This is a term that appears to be a loan but is actually ''[[wasei-eigo]]''.\n\nIt is sometimes difficult for students of Japanese to distinguish among ''gairaigo'', ''[[giseigo]]'' ([[onomatopoeia]]), and ''[[gitaigo]]'' ([[ideophone]]s: words that represent the manner of an action, like \"zigzag\" in [[English language|English]] \u2014 ''jiguzagu'' {{lang|ja|\u30b8\u30b0\u30b6\u30b0}} in Japanese), which are also written in [[katakana]].\n\n''Wasei-eigo'' presents more difficulties for Japanese and learners of Japanese as such words, once entered the lexicon, combine to form any number of potentially confusing combinations. For example, the loanwords ''chance'', ''pink'', ''erotic'', ''over'', ''down'', ''up'', ''in'', ''my'', and ''boom'' have all entered ''wasei-eigo'' lexicon, combining with Japanese words and other English loanwords to produce any number of combination words and phrases. 'Up,' or ''appu'', is famously combined with other words to convey an increase, such as ''seiseki appu'' (increased results) and ''raifu appu'' (improved quality of life). 'My,\" or ''mai'', also regularly appears in advertisements for any number and genre of items. From \"My Fanny\" toilet paper to \"My Hand\" electric hand drills, ''mai'' serves as a common advertising tool. Infamously, the beverage brand Calpis sold a product regrettably named ''mai pisu'' or 'my piss' for a short time.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/174611/Wasei_eigo_English_loanwords_coined_in_Japan|title=The Life of Language: Papers in Linguistics in Honor of William Bright|last=Miller|first=Laura|publisher=Mouton/De Gruyter|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=123-139|chapter=Wasei-eigo: English loanwords coined in Japan}}</ref> \n\n''Wasei-eigo'' is often employed to disguise or advertise risque or sexual terms and innuendos, especially when used by women. ''Wasei-eigo'' terms referencing a person's characteristics, personality, and habits also commonly appear as Japanese street slang, from ''poteto chippusu'' or 'potato chips' for a hick and ''esu efu'' 'SF' for a 'sex friend.'<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Grammatical function==\n''Gairaigo'' are generally nouns, which can be subsequently used as verbs by adding auxiliary verb {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3059\u308b|-suru|\"to do\"}}. For example, \"play soccer\" is translated as \u30b5\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u3059\u308b (sakk\u0101 o suru).\n\nSome exceptions exist, such as {{Nihongo||\u30b5\u30dc\u308b|sabo-ru|\"cut class\", from ''sabotage''}}, which conjugates as a normal Japanese verb \u2013 note the unusual use of ''katakana'' ({{lang|ja|\u30b5\u30dc}}) followed by ''hiragana'' ({{lang|ja|\u308b}}). Another example is ''gugu-ru'' (\u30b0\u30b0\u308b, \"to google\"), which conjugates as a normal Japanese verb, in which the final syllable is converted into ''[[okurigana]]'' to enable conjugation.\n\n''Gairaigo'' function as do morphemes from other sources, and, in addition to ''wasei eigo'' (words or phrases from combining ''gairaigo''), ''gairaigo'' can combine with morphemes of Japanese or Chinese origin in words and phrases, as in {{Nihongo||\u5730\u30d3\u30fc\u30eb|jib\u012bru|local beer}} (compare {{Nihongo||\u5730\u9152|jizake|local sake}}), {{Nihongo||\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u540d|y\u016bz\u0101mei|user name}} (compare {{Nihongo||\u6c0f\u540d|shimei|full name}}) or {{Nihongo||\u6210\u7e3e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7|seiseki-appu|improve (your) grade}}.\n\nIn set phrases, there is sometimes a preference to use all ''gairaigo'' (in ''katakana'') or all ''kango/[[yamato kotoba|wago]]'' (in ''kanji''), as in {{lang|ja|\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3}} (''mansurii manshon'', monthly apartment) versus {{lang|ja|\u6708\u6975\u99d0\u8eca\u5834}}  (''tsukigime ch\u016bshaj\u014d,'' monthly parking lot), but mixed phrases are common, and may be used interchangeably, as in {{lang|ja|\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30c8\u52df\u96c6}} (''tenanto bosh\u016b'') and {{lang|ja|\u5165\u5c45\u8005\u52df\u96c6}} (''ny\u016bkyosha bosh\u016b''), both meaning \"looking for a tenant\".\n\n==Phonology==\n{{further|Katakana}}\nBorrowings traditionally have had pronunciations that conform to Japanese phonology and [[phonotactics]]. For example, ''platform'' was borrowed as /h\u014dmu/, because */fo/ is not a sound combination that traditionally occurs in Japanese. However, in recent years, some ''gairaigo'' are pronounced more closely to their original sound, which is represented by non-traditional combinations of ''katakana'', generally using small ''katakana'' or diacritics (voicing marks) to indicate these non-traditional sounds. Compare {{Nihongo||\u30a4\u30e4\u30db\u30f3|iyahon|\"ear-phones\"}} and ''sumaho'' (\u30b9\u30de\u30db, \"smart phone\"), where traditional sounds are used, and {{Nihongo||\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3|sum\u0101tofon|\"smart-phone\"}}, a variant of the latter word using traditional sounds, where the non-traditional combination {{lang|ja|\u30d5\u30a9}} (fu-o) is used to represent the non-traditional sound combination /fo/. This leads to long words; e.g., the word for \"fanfare\" is spelled out as {{Nihongo||\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30ec|fanf\u0101re}}, with seven ''kana'', no shorter than the Roman alphabet original (it is possible that it was not loaned from English because the \"e\" is not silent).\n\nSimilarly, Japanese traditionally does not have any /v/ phoneme, instead approximating it with /b/, but today /v/ (normally realized ''not'' as <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Voiced labiodental fricative|v]]] but as bilabial <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Voiced bilabial fricative|\u03b2]]]) is sometimes used in pronunciations: for example, \"violin\" can be pronounced either {{Nihongo||\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3|baiorin}} or {{Nihongo||\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3|vaiorin}}, with {{lang|ja|\u30f4\u30a1}} (literally \"voiced u\"+\"a\") representing /va/.\n\nAnother example of the Japanese transformation of English pronunciation is {{Nihongo||\u30bf\u30af\u30b7\u30fc|takush\u012b}}, in which the two-syllable word ''taxi'' becomes three syllables (and four morae, thanks to long ''\u012b'') because consonants don't occur consecutively in traditional Japanese (with the exception of the coda \u3093/\u30f3 or /n/), and in which the sound [si] (\"see\") of English is pronounced <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Voiceless alveolo-palatal sibilant|\u0255]]<nowiki />i] (which to monoglot English speakers will sound like \"she\") because /si/ in Japanese is realized as such.\n\nThis change in Japanese phonology following the introduction of foreign words (here primarily from English) can be compared to the earlier posited change in Japanese phonology following the introduction of Chinese loanwords, such as [[closed syllable]]s (CVC, not just CV) and [[Length (phonetics)|length]] becoming a phonetic feature with the development of both [[Vowel length|long vowels]] and [[Gemination|long consonants]] \u2013 see [[Early Middle Japanese#Phonological developments|Early Middle Japanese: Phonological developments]].\n\nDue to the difficulties that Japanese have in [[Perception of English /r/ and /l/ by Japanese speakers|distinguishing \"l\" and \"r\"]], this expansion of Japanese phonology has not extended to inventing different ''kana'' for /l/ vs. /r/. Therefore, words with /l/ or /r/ may be spelled identically if borrowed into Japanese. One important exception is due to the fact that Japanese typically borrows English words in a [[non-rhotic]] fashion, so that syllable-final \"-r\" and \"-l\" can still be distinguished. For example, \"bell\" is \u30d9\u30eb and \"bear\" is \u30d9\u30a2, rather than both being \u30d9\u30eb.\n\n==As a built-in lexicon of English==\nThe English words that are borrowed into Japanese include many of the most useful English words, including high-frequency vocabulary and academic vocabulary. Thus ''gairaigo'' may constitute a useful built-in lexicon for Japanese learners of English.\n\n''Gairaigo'' have been observed to aid a Japanese child's learning of ESL vocabulary. With adults, ''gairaigo'' assist in English-word aural recognition and pronunciation, spelling, listening comprehension, retention of spoken and written English, and recognition and recall at especially higher levels of vocabulary. Moreover, in their written production, students of Japanese prefer using English words that have become ''gairaigo'' to those that have not.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/wa/yakineko/gairai.html Japanese Loanwords & English Vocabulary Acquisition]</ref>\n\n==Misconceptions==\n\nThe word [[wiktionary:\u6709\u96e3\u3046|''arigat\u014d'']] (Japanese for \"thank you\") sounds similar to the Portuguese word ''obrigado'', which has the same meaning. Given the number of borrowings from Portuguese, it may seem reasonable to suppose that the Japanese imported that word&mdash;which is the explanation accepted and indeed published by many. However, ''arigat\u014d'' is not a ''gairaigo''; rather, it is an abbreviation of ''arigat\u014d gozaimasu'', which consists of an [[inflection]] of the native [[Japanese adjectives|Japanese adjective]] ''arigatai'' ({{lang|ja|\u6709\u96e3\u3044}}) combined with the [[Honorific speech in Japanese|polite verb]] ''gozaimasu''.<ref>[http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/arigatou.html arigat\u014d]</ref> There is evidence, for example in the ''[[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]]'', that the word ''arigatai'' was in use several centuries before contact with the Portuguese. This makes the two terms [[false cognate]]s. If the Portuguese word had been borrowed, it would most likely have taken the form \u30aa\u30d6\u30ea\u30ac\u30c9 (''oburigado''), or maybe ''\u014drigado'' (due to historical ''afu'' and ''ofu'' collapsing to ''\u014d''), and while it is even possible that it would be spelled with {{lang|ja|\u6709\u96e3}} as ''ateji'', it would regardless start with ''o'' rather than ''a'', and the final ''o'' would have been short rather than long.\n\n==Reborrowings from Japanese==\n{{further|Reborrowing}}\nSome ''gairaigo'' words have been [[reborrowing|reborrowed]] into their original source languages, particularly in the jargon of fans of Japanese entertainment. For example, ''[[anime]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1}}) is ''gairaigo'' derived from the English word for \"[[animation]]\", but has been reborrowed by English with the meaning of \"Japanese animation\". Similarly, ''[[puroresu]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u30d7\u30ed\u30ec\u30b9}}) derives from \"[[professional wrestling]]\", and has been adopted by English-speaking wrestling fans as a term for the style of pro wrestling performed in Japan. ''[[Cosplay|Kosupure]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u30b3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec}}), or ''cosplay'', was formed from the English words \"costume play\", referring to dressing in costumes such as those of anime, [[manga]], or videogame characters, and is now used with enthusiasm in English and other languages (also using [[Animated cartoon|Western cartoon]] realms).\n\nThere are also rare examples of borrowings from Indo-European languages, which have subsequently been borrowed by other Indo-European languages, thus yielding distant cognates. An example is {{Nihongo||[[wikt:\u30a4\u30af\u30e9|\u30a4\u30af\u30e9]]|[[ikura]]|salmon eggs}}, originally borrowed from Russian \u0438\u043a\u0440\u0430 (''ikra''), and possibly distantly cognate (from the same Indo-European root) to English \"[[roe]]\" (fish eggs), though the only indication is the shared \"r\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cognate]]\n* [[List of gairaigo and wasei-eigo terms|List of ''gairaigo'' and ''wasei-eigo'' terms]]\n** [[Japanese words of Portuguese origin]]\n** [[Japanese words of Dutch origin]]\n* [[Engrish]]\n* [[List of English words of Japanese origin]]\n* [[Japanese Pidgin English]]\n\n==References==\n;Inline citations\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Sources\n*http://www.tsu.ac.jp/bulletin/bulletin/pdf/15/087-101.pdf{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*http://www.u-bunkyo.ac.jp/center/library/image/kyukiyo9_177-188.pdf\n*https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%A4%96%E6%9D%A5%E8%AA%9E-43025\n*https://www.academia.edu/174611/Wasei_eigo_English_loanwords_coined_in_Japan \n\n{{Japanese language}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{italic title}}\n\n[[Category:Japanese writing system terms]]\n[[Category:Japanese vocabulary]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Loanwords in Japanese}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2011}}\n{{nihongo|'''''Gairaigo'''''|\u5916\u6765\u8a9e||{{IPA-ja|\u0261ai\u027eaigo}}}} is [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for \"[[Loanword|loan word]]\" or \"borrowed word\", and indicates a [[transliteration]] (or \"transvocalization\") into Japanese.  In particular, the word usually refers to a Japanese word of foreign origin that was not borrowed in ancient times from Old or Middle [[Chinese language|Chinese]], but in modern times, primarily from [[English]] or other European languages. These are primarily written in the [[katakana]] phonetic script, with a few older terms written in Chinese characters ([[kanji]]); the latter are known as [[ateji]].\n\nJapanese has a large number of [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|loan words from Chinese]], accounting for a sizeable fraction of the language. These words were borrowed during ancient times and are written in ''kanji''. Modern Chinese loanwords are generally considered ''gairaigo'' and written in ''katakana'', or sometimes written in ''kanji'' (either with the more familiar word as a base text gloss and the intended ''katakana'' as [[furigana]] or vice versa); pronunciation of modern Chinese loanwords generally differs from the corresponding usual pronunciation of the characters in Japanese.\n\nFor a list of terms, see the [[List of gairaigo and wasei-eigo terms]].\n\n== Source languages ==\nJapanese has a long history of borrowing from foreign languages. It has been doing so since the late fourth century A.D. Some ancient ''gairaigo'' words are still being used nowadays, but there are also many kinds of ''gairaigo'' words that were borrowed more recently.\n\nMost, but not all, modern ''gairaigo'' are derived from [[English language|English]], particularly in the post-World War II era (after 1945). Words are taken from English for concepts that do not exist in Japanese, but also for other reasons, such as a preference for English terms or fashionability \u2013 many ''gairaigo'' have Japanese near-synonyms.\n\nIn the past, more ''gairaigo'' came from other languages besides English. The first period of borrowing occurred during the late fourth century A.D., when a massive number of Chinese characters were adopted. This period could be considered as one of the most significant in the history of ''gairaigo'', because it was the first moment when the written communication systems using ''kanji'' were formed.\n\nThe first non-Asian countries to have extensive contact with Japan were [[Portugal]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Japanese has several loanwords from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], many of which are still used. The interaction between Japan and Portugal lasted from the late middle age until the early Edo era. (1549-1638). An example of the loanwords from Portuguese is ''rasha'', meaning a thick wool cloth that was indispensable during the period, but not used often nowadays. In the Edo era (1603-1853), words from the Dutch language, such as ''glas'', ''gas'', and ''alcohol'', started to have an impact in the Japanese language. Also, during the Edo era, many medical words like ''Gaze'' (meaning [[gauze]]) and ''neuroses'' came from German, and many artistic words such as ''rouge'' and ''dessin'' came from French. Most of the ''gairaigo'' since the nineteenth century came from English.\n\nIn the [[Meiji era]] (late 19th to early 20th century), Japan also had extensive contact with [[Germany]], and gained many loanwords from [[German language|German]], particularly for Western medicine, which the Japanese learned from the Germans. Notable examples include {{Nihongo||[[wikt:\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8]]|arubaito|part-time work}} (often abbreviated to {{Nihongo||\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8|baito}}) from German ''[[wikt:Arbeit|Arbeit]]'' (\"work\"), and {{Nihongo||[[wikt:\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc|\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc]]|enerug\u012b|energy}} from German ''[[wikt:Energie|Energie]]''. They also gained several loanwords from [[French language|French]] at this time.\n\nIn modern times, there are some borrowings from Modern Chinese and Modern Korean, particularly for food names, and these continue as new foods become popular in Japan; standard examples include ''\u016bron'' (\u70cf\u9f8d \u30a6\u30fc\u30ed\u30f3 \"[[oolong]] tea\") and ''kimuchi'' (\u30ad\u30e0\u30c1 \"[[kimchi]]\"), respectively, while more specialized examples include ''hoik\u014dr\u014d'' ([[:ja:\u56de\u934b\u8089|\u56de\u934b\u8089]] \u30db\u30a4\u30b3\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc \"[[twice cooked pork]]\") from Chinese, and ''bibinba'' ([[:ja:\u30d3\u30d3\u30f3\u30d0|\u30d3\u30d3\u30f3\u30d0]] \"[[bibimbap]]\") from Korean. Chinese words are often represented with Chinese characters, but with ''katakana'' gloss to indicate the unusual pronunciation, while Korean words, which no longer regularly use Chinese characters (''[[hanja]]''), are represented in ''katakana''. There is sometimes ambiguity in pronunciation of these borrowings, particularly voicing, such as ''to'' (\u30c8) vs. ''do'' (\u30c9)  \u2013 compare English's [[Daoism\u2013Taoism romanization issue]].\n\nSome Modern Chinese borrowings occurred during the 17th and 18th centuries, due both to trade and resident Chinese in [[Nagasaki]], and a more recent wave of Buddhist monks, the [[\u014cbaku]] school, whose words are derived from languages spoken in [[Fujian]]. More recent Korean borrowings are influenced both by proximity, and to the substantial population of [[Koreans in Japan]] since the early 20th century.\n\nIn 1889, there were 85 ''gairaigo'' of Dutch origin and 72 ''gairaigo'' of English origin listed in a Japanese dictionary.{{which|date=July 2018}}{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} From 1911 to 1924, 51% of ''gairaigo'' listed in dictionaries were of English origin, and today, 80% to 90% of ''gairaigo'' are of English origin.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThere have been some borrowings from [[Sanskrit]] as well, most notably for religious terms. These words are generally transliterations which were unknowingly borrowed from Chinese.<ref>[https://www.nichirenlibrary.org \"Sanskrit Names And Their Japanese Equivalents\" ]</ref>\n\n;Cognates\nIn some cases, [[cognate]]s or etymologically related words from different languages may be borrowed and sometimes used synonymously or sometimes used distinctly.\n\nThe most common basic example is {{Nihongo||[[wikt:\u30ab\u30c3\u30d7|\u30ab\u30c3\u30d7]]|kappu|\"cup (with handle), mug\"|from English ''[[wikt:cup|cup]]''}} versus earlier {{Nihongo||[[wikt:\u30b3\u30c3\u30d7|\u30b3\u30c3\u30d7]]|koppu|\"cup (without handle), tumbler\"|from Dutch ''[[wikt:kop|kop]]'' or Portuguese ''[[wikt:copo|copo]]''}}, where they are used distinctly. A more technical example is {{Nihongo||[[:ja:\u30bd\u30eb\u30d3\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb|\u30bd\u30eb\u30d3\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb]]|sorubit\u014dru}} (English ''[[sorbitol]]'') versus {{Nihongo||\u30bd\u30eb\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8|sorubitto}} (German ''[[:de:Sorbit|Sorbit]]''), used synonymously.\n\n;''Wasei-kango''\nIn addition to borrowings, which adopted both meaning and pronunciation, Japanese also has an extensive set of new words that are crafted using existing Chinese morphemes to express a foreign term. These are known as ''[[wasei-kango]]'' \"Japanese-made Chinese words\". This process is similar to the creation of [[classical compound]]s in European languages. Many were coined in the Meiji period, and these are very common in medical terminology. These are not considered ''gairaigo'', as the foreign word itself has not been borrowed, and sometimes a translation and a borrowing are both used.\n\n== Writing ==\n{{main article|Transcription into Japanese}}\nIn [[Japanese writing system|written Japanese]], ''gairaigo'' are usually written in ''[[katakana]]''.  Older loanwords are also often written using ''[[ateji]]'' (''[[kanji]]'' chosen for their phonetic value, or sometimes for meaning instead) or [[hiragana]], for example ''tabaco'' from Portuguese, meaning \"tobacco\" or \"cigarette\" can be written {{lang|ja|\u30bf\u30d0\u30b3}} (''katakana''), {{lang|ja|\u305f\u3070\u3053}} (''hiragana''), or {{lang|ja|\u7159\u8349}} (the ''kanji'' for \"smoke grass\", but still pronounced \"tabako\" \u2013 meaning-''ateji''), with no change in meaning. Another common older example is ''[[tempura]],'' which is usually written in mixed ''kanji''/''kana'' ([[mazegaki]]) as {{lang|ja|\u5929\u3077\u3089}}, but is also written as {{lang|ja|\u3066\u3093\u3077\u3089, \u30c6\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9, \u5929\u9ea9\u7f85}} (rare kanji) or {{lang|ja|\u5929\u5a66\u7f85}} (common kanji) \u2013 here it is sound-''ateji,'' with the characters used for sound value only.\n\nFew ''gairaigo'' are sometimes written with a single ''kanji'' character (chosen for meaning or newly created); consequently, these are considered ''[[kun'yomi]]'' rather than ''ateji'' because the single characters are used for meaning rather than for sound and are often written as katakana. An example is {{nihongo||\u9801\u3001\u30da\u30fc\u30b8|p\u0113ji|page}}; see [[Ateji#Single-character loan words|single-character loan words]] for details.\n\n==False friends and ''wasei-eigo''==\nThere are numerous causes for confusion in ''gairaigo'': (1) ''gairaigo'' are often abbreviated, (2) their meaning may change (either in Japanese or in the original language after the borrowing has occurred), (3) many words are not borrowed but rather coined in Japanese (''[[wasei-eigo]]'' \"English made in Japan\"), and (4) not all ''gairaigo'' come from English.\n\nDue to Japanese pronunciation rules and its [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]-based phonology, many words take a significant amount of time to pronounce. For example, a one-syllable word in a language such as English (''brake'') often becomes several syllables when pronounced in Japanese (in this case, ''bur\u0113ki'' ({{lang|ja|\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30ad}}), which amounts to four moras). The Japanese language, therefore, contains many [[Japanese abbreviated and contracted words|abbreviated and contracted words]], and there is a strong tendency to shorten words. This also occurs with ''gairaigo'' words. For example, \"remote control\", when transcribed in Japanese, becomes ''rim\u014dto kontor\u014dru'' ({{lang|ja|\u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb}}), but this has then been simplified to ''rimokon'' ({{lang|ja|\u30ea\u30e2\u30b3\u30f3}}). For another example, the transcribed word for \"department store\" is ''dep\u0101tomento sutoa'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c7\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2}}) but has since been shortened to ''dep\u0101to'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c7\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8}}). [[Clipped compound]]s, such as ''w\u0101puro'' ({{lang|ja|\u30ef\u30fc\u30d7\u30ed}}) for \"word processor\", are common. ''[[Karaoke]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u30ab\u30e9\u30aa\u30b1}}), a combination of the Japanese word ''kara'' \"empty\" and the clipped form, ''oke'', of the English loanword \"orchestra\" (J. ''\u014dkesutora'' {{lang|ja|\u30aa\u30fc\u30b1\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9}}), is a clipped compound that has entered the English language. Japanese ordinarily takes the first part of a foreign word, but in some cases the second syllable is used instead; notable examples from English include {{Nihongo||\u30db\u30fc\u30e0|h\u014dmu|from \"(train station) plat-form\"}} and {{Nihongo||\u30cd\u30eb\u30b7\u30e3\u30c4|nerushatsu|\"flan-nel\"}}.\n\nSome Japanese people are not aware of the origins of the words in their language, and may assume that all ''gairaigo'' words are legitimate English words. For example, Japanese people may use words like ''t\u0113ma'' ({{lang|ja|\u30c6\u30fc\u30de}}, from German ''Thema'', meaning \"topic/theme\") in English, or ''rimokon'', not realizing that the contraction of \"remote control\" to ''rimokon'' took place in Japan.\n\nSimilarly, ''gairaigo'', while making Japanese easier to learn for foreign students in some cases, can also cause problems due to independent [[semantic progression]]. For example, English \"stove\", from which ''sut\u014dbu'' ({{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30d6}}) is derived, has multiple meanings. Americans often use the word to mean a cooking appliance, and are thus surprised when Japanese take it to mean a space heater (such as a wood-burning stove). The Japanese term for a cooking stove is another ''gairaigo'' term, ''renji'' ({{lang|ja|\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8}}), from the English \"range\"; a gas stove is a ''gasurenji'' ({{lang|ja|\u30ac\u30b9\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8}}).\n\nAdditionally, Japanese combines words in ways that are uncommon in English. As an example, ''left over'' is a [[baseball]] term for a hit that goes over the left-fielder's head rather than uneaten food saved for a later meal. This is a term that appears to be a loan but is actually ''[[wasei-eigo]]''.\n\nIt is sometimes difficult for students of Japanese to distinguish among ''gairaigo'', ''[[giseigo]]'' ([[onomatopoeia]]), and ''[[gitaigo]]'' ([[ideophone]]s: words that represent the manner of an action, like \"zigzag\" in [[English language|English]] \u2014 ''jiguzagu'' {{lang|ja|\u30b8\u30b0\u30b6\u30b0}} in Japanese), which are also written in [[katakana]].\n\n''Wasei-eigo'' presents more difficulties for Japanese and learners of Japanese as such words, once entered the lexicon, combine to form any number of potentially confusing combinations. For example, the loanwords ''chance'', ''pink'', ''erotic'', ''over'', ''down'', ''up'', ''in'', ''my'', and ''boom'' have all entered ''wasei-eigo'' lexicon, combining with Japanese words and other English loanwords to produce any number of combination words and phrases. 'Up,' or ''appu'', is famously combined with other words to convey an increase, such as ''seiseki appu'' (increased results) and ''raifu appu'' (improved quality of life). 'My,\" or ''mai'', also regularly appears in advertisements for any number and genre of items. From \"My Fanny\" toilet paper to \"My Hand\" electric hand drills, ''mai'' serves as a common advertising tool. Infamously, the beverage brand Calpis sold a product regrettably named ''mai pisu'' or 'my piss' for a short time.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/174611/Wasei_eigo_English_loanwords_coined_in_Japan|title=The Life of Language: Papers in Linguistics in Honor of William Bright|last=Miller|first=Laura|publisher=Mouton/De Gruyter|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=123-139|chapter=Wasei-eigo: English loanwords coined in Japan}}</ref> \n\n''Wasei-eigo'' is often employed to disguise or advertise risque or sexual terms and innuendos, especially when used by women. ''Wasei-eigo'' terms referencing a person's characteristics, personality, and habits also commonly appear as Japanese street slang, from ''poteto chippusu'' or 'potato chips' for a hick and ''esu efu'' 'SF' for a 'sex friend.'<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Grammatical function==\n''Gairaigo'' are generally nouns, which can be subsequently used as verbs by adding auxiliary verb {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3059\u308b|-suru|\"to do\"}}. For example, \"play soccer\" is translated as \u30b5\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc\u3092\u3059\u308b (sakk\u0101 o suru).\n\nSome exceptions exist, such as {{Nihongo||\u30b5\u30dc\u308b|sabo-ru|\"cut class\", from ''sabotage''}}, which conjugates as a normal Japanese verb \u2013 note the unusual use of ''katakana'' ({{lang|ja|\u30b5\u30dc}}) followed by ''hiragana'' ({{lang|ja|\u308b}}). Another example is ''gugu-ru'' (\u30b0\u30b0\u308b, \"to google\"), which conjugates as a normal Japanese verb, in which the final syllable is converted into ''[[okurigana]]'' to enable conjugation.\n\n''Gairaigo'' function as do morphemes from other sources, and, in addition to ''wasei eigo'' (words or phrases from combining ''gairaigo''), ''gairaigo'' can combine with morphemes of Japanese or Chinese origin in words and phrases, as in {{Nihongo||\u5730\u30d3\u30fc\u30eb|jib\u012bru|local beer}} (compare {{Nihongo||\u5730\u9152|jizake|local sake}}), {{Nihongo||\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u540d|y\u016bz\u0101mei|user name}} (compare {{Nihongo||\u6c0f\u540d|shimei|full name}}) or {{Nihongo||\u6210\u7e3e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7|seiseki-appu|improve (your) grade}}.\n\nIn set phrases, there is sometimes a preference to use all ''gairaigo'' (in ''katakana'') or all ''kango/[[yamato kotoba|wago]]'' (in ''kanji''), as in {{lang|ja|\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3}} (''mansurii manshon'', monthly apartment) versus {{lang|ja|\u6708\u6975\u99d0\u8eca\u5834}}  (''tsukigime ch\u016bshaj\u014d,'' monthly parking lot), but mixed phrases are common, and may be used interchangeably, as in {{lang|ja|\u30c6\u30ca\u30f3\u30c8\u52df\u96c6}} (''tenanto bosh\u016b'') and {{lang|ja|\u5165\u5c45\u8005\u52df\u96c6}} (''ny\u016bkyosha bosh\u016b''), both meaning \"looking for a tenant\".\n\n==Phonology==\n{{further|Katakana}}\nBorrowings traditionally have had pronunciations that conform to Japanese phonology and [[phonotactics]]. For example, ''platform'' was borrowed as /h\u014dmu/, because */fo/ is not a sound combination that traditionally occurs in Japanese. However, in recent years, some ''gairaigo'' are pronounced more closely to their original sound, which is represented by non-traditional combinations of ''katakana'', generally using small ''katakana'' or diacritics (voicing marks) to indicate these non-traditional sounds. Compare {{Nihongo||\u30a4\u30e4\u30db\u30f3|iyahon|\"ear-phones\"}} and ''sumaho'' (\u30b9\u30de\u30db, \"smart phone\"), where traditional sounds are used, and {{Nihongo||\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3|sum\u0101tofon|\"smart-phone\"}}, a variant of the latter word using traditional sounds, where the non-traditional combination {{lang|ja|\u30d5\u30a9}} (fu-o) is used to represent the non-traditional sound combination /fo/. This leads to long words; e.g., the word for \"fanfare\" is spelled out as {{Nihongo||\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30ec|fanf\u0101re}}, with seven ''kana'', no shorter than the Roman alphabet original (it is possible that it was not loaned from English because the \"e\" is not silent).\n\nSimilarly, Japanese traditionally does not have any /v/ phoneme, instead approximating it with /b/, but today /v/ (normally realized ''not'' as <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Voiced labiodental fricative|v]]] but as bilabial <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Voiced bilabial fricative|\u03b2]]]) is sometimes used in pronunciations: for example, \"violin\" can be pronounced either {{Nihongo||\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3|baiorin}} or {{Nihongo||\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30aa\u30ea\u30f3|vaiorin}}, with {{lang|ja|\u30f4\u30a1}} (literally \"voiced u\"+\"a\") representing /va/.\n\nAnother example of the Japanese transformation of English pronunciation is {{Nihongo||\u30bf\u30af\u30b7\u30fc|takush\u012b}}, in which the two-syllable word ''taxi'' becomes three syllables (and four morae, thanks to long ''\u012b'') because consonants don't occur consecutively in traditional Japanese (with the exception of the coda \u3093/\u30f3 or /n/), and in which the sound [si] (\"see\") of English is pronounced <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Voiceless alveolo-palatal sibilant|\u0255]]<nowiki />i] (which to monoglot English speakers will sound like \"she\") because /si/ in Japanese is realized as such.\n\nThis change in Japanese phonology following the introduction of foreign words (here primarily from English) can be compared to the earlier posited change in Japanese phonology following the introduction of Chinese loanwords, such as [[closed syllable]]s (CVC, not just CV) and [[Length (phonetics)|length]] becoming a phonetic feature with the development of both [[Vowel length|long vowels]] and [[Gemination|long consonants]] \u2013 see [[Early Middle Japanese#Phonological developments|Early Middle Japanese: Phonological developments]].\n\nDue to the difficulties that Japanese have in [[Perception of English /r/ and /l/ by Japanese speakers|distinguishing \"l\" and \"r\"]], this expansion of Japanese phonology has not extended to inventing different ''kana'' for /l/ vs. /r/. Therefore, words with /l/ or /r/ may be spelled identically if borrowed into Japanese. One important exception is due to the fact that Japanese typically borrows English words in a [[non-rhotic]] fashion, so that syllable-final \"-r\" and \"-l\" can still be distinguished. For example, \"bell\" is \u30d9\u30eb and \"bear\" is \u30d9\u30a2, rather than both being \u30d9\u30eb.\n\n==As a built-in lexicon of English==\nThe English words that are borrowed into Japanese include many of the most useful English words, including high-frequency vocabulary and academic vocabulary. Thus ''gairaigo'' may constitute a useful built-in lexicon for Japanese learners of English.\n\n''Gairaigo'' have been observed to aid a Japanese child's learning of ESL vocabulary. With adults, ''gairaigo'' assist in English-word aural recognition and pronunciation, spelling, listening comprehension, retention of spoken and written English, and recognition and recall at especially higher levels of vocabulary. Moreover, in their written production, students of Japanese prefer using English words that have become ''gairaigo'' to those that have not.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/wa/yakineko/gairai.html Japanese Loanwords & English Vocabulary Acquisition]</ref>\n\n==Misconceptions==\n\nThe word [[wiktionary:\u6709\u96e3\u3046|''arigat\u014d'']] (Japanese for \"thank you\") sounds similar to the Portuguese word ''obrigado'', which has the same meaning. Given the number of borrowings from Portuguese, it may seem reasonable to suppose that the Japanese imported that word&mdash;which is the explanation accepted and indeed published by many. However, ''arigat\u014d'' is not a ''gairaigo''; rather, it is an abbreviation of ''arigat\u014d gozaimasu'', which consists of an [[inflection]] of the native [[Japanese adjectives|Japanese adjective]] ''arigatai'' ({{lang|ja|\u6709\u96e3\u3044}}) combined with the [[Honorific speech in Japanese|polite verb]] ''gozaimasu''.<ref>[http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/arigatou.html arigat\u014d]</ref> There is evidence, for example in the ''[[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]]'', that the word ''arigatai'' was in use several centuries before contact with the Portuguese. This makes the two terms [[false cognate]]s. If the Portuguese word had been borrowed, it would most likely have taken the form \u30aa\u30d6\u30ea\u30ac\u30c9 (''oburigado''), or maybe ''\u014drigado'' (due to historical ''afu'' and ''ofu'' collapsing to ''\u014d''), and while it is even possible that it would be spelled with {{lang|ja|\u6709\u96e3}} as ''ateji'', it would regardless start with ''o'' rather than ''a'', and the final ''o'' would have been short rather than long.\n\n==Reborrowings from Japanese==\n{{further|Reborrowing}}\nSome ''gairaigo'' words have been [[reborrowing|reborrowed]] into their original source languages, particularly in the jargon of fans of Japanese entertainment. For example, ''[[anime]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1}}) is ''gairaigo'' derived from the English word for \"[[animation]]\", but has been reborrowed by English with the meaning of \"Japanese animation\". Similarly, ''[[puroresu]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u30d7\u30ed\u30ec\u30b9}}) derives from \"[[professional wrestling]]\", and has been adopted by English-speaking wrestling fans as a term for the style of pro wrestling performed in Japan. ''[[Cosplay|Kosupure]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u30b3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec}}), or ''cosplay'', was formed from the English words \"costume play\", referring to dressing in costumes such as those of anime, [[manga]], or videogame characters, and is now used with enthusiasm in English and other languages (also using [[Animated cartoon|Western cartoon]] realms).\n\nThere are also rare examples of borrowings from Indo-European languages, which have subsequently been borrowed by other Indo-European languages, thus yielding distant cognates. An example is {{Nihongo||[[wikt:\u30a4\u30af\u30e9|\u30a4\u30af\u30e9]]|[[ikura]]|salmon eggs}}, originally borrowed from Russian \u0438\u043a\u0440\u0430 (''ikra''), and possibly distantly cognate (from the same Indo-European root) to English \"[[roe]]\" (fish eggs), though the only indication is the shared \"r\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cognate]]\n* [[List of gairaigo and wasei-eigo terms|List of ''gairaigo'' and ''wasei-eigo'' terms]]\n** [[Japanese words of Portuguese origin]]\n** [[Japanese words of Dutch origin]]\n* [[Engrish]]\n* [[List of English words of Japanese origin]]\n* [[Japanese Pidgin English]]\n\n==References==\n;Inline citations\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Sources\n*http://www.tsu.ac.jp/bulletin/bulletin/pdf/15/087-101.pdf{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*http://www.u-bunkyo.ac.jp/center/library/image/kyukiyo9_177-188.pdf\n*https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%A4%96%E6%9D%A5%E8%AA%9E-43025\n*https://www.academia.edu/174611/Wasei_eigo_English_loanwords_coined_in_Japan \n\n{{Japanese language}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{italic title}}\n\n[[Category:Japanese writing system terms]]\n[[Category:Japanese vocabulary]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toEnglish(link changed toEnglish language) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gairaigo"}

[[Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha]] headquartered at [[Chennai]] was formed to spread Hindi in [[South India|South Indian states]]. Regional Hindi implementation offices at [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Guwahati]], [[Bhopal]], [[Delhi]] and [[Ghaziabad, India|Ghaziabad]] have been established to monitor the implementation of Hindi in Central government offices and PSUs.\n\nAnnual targets are set by the Department of Official Language regarding the amount of correspondence being carried out in Hindi. A Parliament Committee on Official Language constituted in 1976 periodically reviews the progress in the use of Hindi and submits a report to the President. The governmental body which makes policy decisions and established guidelines for promotion of Hindi is the ''Kendriya Hindi Samiti'' (est. 1967). In every city that has more than ten central Government offices, a Town Official Language Implementation Committee is established and cash awards are given to government employees who write books in Hindi. All Central government offices and PSUs are to establish Hindi Cells for implementation of Hindi in their offices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Language \u2013 Constitutional/Statutory Provisions |url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/official_language.php |work=[[Government of India]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417150059/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/official_language.php |archivedate=17 April 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the government announced plans to promote Hindi in government offices in [[South India|Southern]] and [[Northeast India]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/centre-to-promote-use-of-hindi-in-south-india-northeast-jitendra-singh/|title=Centre to promote use of Hindi in South India, Northeast:<br/>In response to this several NGO and political parties have started agitation and some have even re-sorted to violent protests in the Darjeeling for separate statehood, which started in after the official statement in press meet by Central parliamentary affairs minister.

Examples include [[Kokborok]] in [[Tripura]] and [[Mizo language|Mizo]] in [[Mizoram]].\n\n=== Legislature and administration ===\nThe constitutional provisions in relation to use of the official language in legislation at the [[States and union territories of India|State level]] largely mirror those relating to the official language at the central level, with minor variations. State legislatures may conduct their business in their [[official language]], Hindi or (for a transitional period, which the legislature can extend if it so chooses) English, and members who cannot use any of these have the same rights to their [[mother tongue]] with the Speaker's permission. The authoritative text of all laws must be in English, unless Parliament passes a law permitting a state to use another language, and if the original text of a law is in a different language, an authoritative English translation of all laws must be prepared.\n\nThe state has the right to regulate the use of its official language in [[public administration]], and in general, neither the constitution nor any central enactment imposes any restriction on this right. However, every person submitting a [[petition]] for the redress of a grievance to an officer or authority of the state government has a constitutional right to submit it in any language used in that state, regardless of its official status.\n\nIn addition, the constitution grants the central government, acting through the [[President of India|President]], the power to issue certain directives to the government of a state in relation to the use of [[minority language]]s for official purposes. The President may direct a State to officially recognise a language spoken in its territory for specified purposes and in specified regions, if its speakers demand it and satisfy him that a substantial proportion of the State's population desire its use. Similarly, States and local authorities are required to endeavour to provide [[primary education]] in the mother tongue for all [[linguistic minority|linguistic minorities]], regardless of whether their language is official in that State, and the President has the power to issue directions he deems necessary to ensure that they are provided these facilities.\n\n=== State judiciary ===\nStates have significantly less freedom in relation to determine the language in which judicial proceedings in their respective [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] will be conducted.

[[Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha]] headquartered at [[Chennai]] was formed to spread Hindi in [[South India|South Indian states]]. Regional Hindi implementation offices at [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Guwahati]], [[Bhopal]], [[Delhi]] and [[Ghaziabad, India|Ghaziabad]] have been established to monitor the implementation of Hindi in Central government offices and PSUs.\n\nAnnual targets are set by the Department of Official Language regarding the amount of correspondence being carried out in Hindi. A Parliament Committee on Official Language constituted in 1976 periodically reviews the progress in the use of Hindi and submits a report to the President. The governmental body which makes policy decisions and established guidelines for promotion of Hindi is the ''Kendriya Hindi Samiti'' (est. 1967). In every city that has more than ten central Government offices, a Town Official Language Implementation Committee is established and cash awards are given to government employees who write books in Hindi. All Central government offices and PSUs are to establish Hindi Cells for implementation of Hindi in their offices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Language \u2013 Constitutional/Statutory Provisions |url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/official_language.php |work=[[Government of India]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417150059/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/official_language.php |archivedate=17 April 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the government announced plans to promote Hindi in government offices in [[South India|Southern]] and [[Northeast India]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/centre-to-promote-use-of-hindi-in-south-india-northeast-jitendra-singh/|title=Centre to promote use of Hindi in South India, Northeast:<br/>In response to this several NGO and political parties have started agitation and some have even re-sorted to violent protests in the Darjeeling for separate statehood, which started in after the official statement in press meet by Central parliamentary affairs minister.

Examples include [[Kokborok]] in [[Tripura]] and [[Mizo language|Mizo]] in [[Mizoram]].\n\n=== Legislature and administration ===\nThe constitutional provisions in relation to use of the official language in legislation at the [[States and union territories of India|State level]] largely mirror those relating to the official language at the central level, with minor variations. State legislatures may conduct their business in their [[official language]], Hindi or (for a transitional period, which the legislature can extend if it so chooses) English, and members who cannot use any of these have the same rights to their [[mother tongue]] with the Speaker's permission. The authoritative text of all laws must be in English, unless Parliament passes a law permitting a state to use another language, and if the original text of a law is in a different language, an authoritative English translation of all laws must be prepared.\n\nThe state has the right to regulate the use of its official language in [[public administration]], and in general, neither the constitution nor any central enactment imposes any restriction on this right. However, every person submitting a [[petition]] for the redress of a grievance to an officer or authority of the state government has a constitutional right to submit it in any language used in that state, regardless of its official status.\n\nIn addition, the constitution grants the central government, acting through the [[President of India|President]], the power to issue certain directives to the government of a state in relation to the use of [[minority language]]s for official purposes. The President may direct a State to officially recognise a language spoken in its territory for specified purposes and in specified regions, if its speakers demand it and satisfy him that a substantial proportion of the State's population desire its use. Similarly, States and local authorities are required to endeavour to provide [[primary education]] in the mother tongue for all [[linguistic minority|linguistic minorities]], regardless of whether their language is official in that State, and the President has the power to issue directions he deems necessary to ensure that they are provided these facilities.\n\n=== State judiciary ===\nStates have significantly less freedom in relation to determine the language in which judicial proceedings in their respective [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] will be conducted. The constitution gives the power to authorise the use of Hindi, or the state's official language in proceedings of the High Court to the [[Governors and Lieutenant-Governors of states of India|Governor]], rather than the state legislature, and requires the Governor to obtain the consent of the [[President of India]], who in these matters acts on the advice of the [[Government of India]]. The Official Languages Act gives the Governor a similar power, subject to similar conditions, in relation to the language in which the High Court's judgments will be delivered.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) \u2013 Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) \u2013 Section 7 | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nFour states\u2014[[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]]\u2014<ref>[http://www.barandbench.com/index.php?title=Language%20in%20Courts%20-%20a%20bridge%20or%20a%20barrier?&page=brief&id=805&gn=0 Language in Courts \u2013 a bridge or a barrier?]</ref> have been granted the right to conduct proceedings in their High Courts in their official language, which, for all of them, was Hindi.

The ninth cyclone and fourth [[tropical cyclone scales#Australia and Fiji|severe tropical cyclone]] of the [[1999\u20132000 Australian region cyclone season]], Tessi developed on 1 April from a persistent [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] of low pressure in the [[Coral Sea]] and slowly tracked west-southwestward. Tessi was an unusually compact storm that strengthened rapidly just before [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]], peaking as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the [[Tropical cyclone scales|Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale]] with 10-minute average [[maximum sustained wind|maximum winds]] of 140 km/h (85 mph). Around 22:00 [[Universal Coordinated Time|UTC]] on 2 April, Tessi moved ashore about 75 km (45 mi) northwest of [[Townsville]] and rapidly diminished as it progressed inland. At the height of the storm, [[Magnetic Island]] experienced sustained winds of {{convert|109|km/h|abbr=on}}, while gusts as high as {{convert|130|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} were recorded in Townsville.\n\nTessi's strong winds caused widespread damage along the coast from [[Ingham, Queensland|Ingham]] to [[Ayr, Queensland|Ayr]], most notably around Townsville, where many trees were uprooted and 50,000 homes lost electricity. Buildings and vehicles were damaged by the winds and fallen trees, and roadways surrounding the city became impassable. Torrential rains, amounting to {{convert|423.4|mm|in|abbr=on}} in just 24 hours, saturated a hillside in [[Castle Hill, Queensland|Castle Hill]] and caused a large [[landslide]]. Hundreds of Castle Hill residents were forced to leave their homes, and many structures were inundated with mud and debris. The landslide dislodged a large boulder uphill from several residences, creating a period of local concern before workers stabilised the slope. Along the coast, the storm wrecked boats and eroded beaches. Total damage in Townsville was estimated to be at least $50&nbsp;million (2000 [[Australian dollar|AUD]]), and the name ''Tessi'' was later [[List of retired Australian cyclone names#Tropical Cyclone names retired in the 2000s|retired]] due to the cyclone's impacts.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Tessi 2000 track.png}}\nCyclone Tessi originated in a northwest\u2013southeast oriented [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] of low pressure that developed in the [[Coral Sea]] at the end of March 2000.<ref name=\"water\"/> Similar conditions would lead to the genesis of [[1999\u20132000 Australian region cyclone season#Tropical Cyclone Vaughan|Cyclone Vaughan]] in the same region just days later.<ref name=\"gp\"/> Initially forming within the [[trade winds]] east of an [[cold-core low|upper-level trough]] over eastern Australia, the disturbance that ultimately spawned Tessi persisted in the area for nearly a week before becoming associated with an organised area of [[atmospheric convection|convection]] on 31 March,<ref name=\"water\">{{cite book|authors=Bonell, M. and Bruijnzeel, L.

Australian region cyclone season]]\n}}\n'''Severe Tropical Cyclone Tessi''' was a small but potent [[tropical cyclone]] that caused extensive damage along the coast of [[North Queensland]] in early April 2000. The ninth cyclone and fourth [[tropical cyclone scales#Australia and Fiji|severe tropical cyclone]] of the [[1999\u20132000 Australian region cyclone season]], Tessi developed on 1 April from a persistent [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] of low pressure in the [[Coral Sea]] and slowly tracked west-southwestward. Tessi was an unusually compact storm that strengthened rapidly just before [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]], peaking as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the [[Tropical cyclone scales|Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale]] with 10-minute average [[maximum sustained wind|maximum winds]] of 140 km/h (85 mph). Around 22:00 [[Universal Coordinated Time|UTC]] on 2 April, Tessi moved ashore about 75 km (45 mi) northwest of [[Townsville]] and rapidly diminished as it progressed inland. At the height of the storm, [[Magnetic Island]] experienced sustained winds of {{convert|109|km/h|abbr=on}}, while gusts as high as {{convert|130|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} were recorded in Townsville.\n\nTessi's strong winds caused widespread damage along the coast from [[Ingham, Queensland|Ingham]] to [[Ayr, Queensland|Ayr]], most notably around Townsville, where many trees were uprooted and 50,000 homes lost electricity. Buildings and vehicles were damaged by the winds and fallen trees, and roadways surrounding the city became impassable. Torrential rains, amounting to {{convert|423.4|mm|in|abbr=on}} in just 24 hours, saturated a hillside in [[Castle Hill, Queensland|Castle Hill]] and caused a large [[landslide]]. Hundreds of Castle Hill residents were forced to leave their homes, and many structures were inundated with mud and debris. The landslide dislodged a large boulder uphill from several residences, creating a period of local concern before workers stabilised the slope. Along the coast, the storm wrecked boats and eroded beaches. Total damage in Townsville was estimated to be at least $50&nbsp;million (2000 [[Australian dollar|AUD]]), and the name ''Tessi'' was later [[List of retired Australian cyclone names#Tropical Cyclone names retired in the 2000s|retired]] due to the cyclone's impacts.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Tessi 2000 track.png}}\nCyclone Tessi originated in a northwest\u2013southeast oriented [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] of low pressure that developed in the [[Coral Sea]] at the end of March 2000.<ref name=\"water\"/> Similar conditions would lead to the genesis of [[1999\u20132000 Australian region cyclone season#Tropical Cyclone Vaughan|Cyclone Vaughan]] in the same region just days later.<ref name=\"gp\"/> Initially forming within the [[trade winds]] east of an [[cold-core low|upper-level trough]] over eastern Australia, the disturbance that ultimately spawned Tessi persisted in the area for nearly a week before becoming associated with an organised area of [[atmospheric convection|convection]] on 31 March,<ref name=\"water\">{{cite book|authors=Bonell, M. and Bruijnzeel, L.

Due to China's historical dominance of East Asian culture, many names used in [[Korean name|Korea]] and [[Vietnamese name|Vietnam]] are adaptations of Chinese names, or have historical roots in Chinese, with appropriate adaptation to accommodate linguistic differences.\n\nModern Chinese names consist of a surname known as '''xing''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59d3}}}}, ''x\u00ecng''), which comes first and is usually but [[Chinese compound surname|not always]] monosyllabic, followed by a personal name called '''ming''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u540d}}}}, ''m\u00edng''), which is nearly always mono- or disyllabic.  Prior to the 20th century, educated Chinese also utilized a \"[[courtesy name]]\" or \"style name\" called '''zi''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b57}}}}, ''z\u00ec'') by which they were known among those outside their family and closest friends.\n\nFrom at least the time of the [[Shang dynasty]], the [[Han people|Chinese]] observed a number of [[naming taboo]]s regulating who may or may not use a person's given name (without being disrespectful). In general, using the given name connoted the speaker's authority and superior position to the addressee. Peers and younger relatives were barred from speaking it. Owing to this, many historical Chinese figures\u2014particularly emperors\u2014used a half-dozen or more different names in different contexts and for different speakers. Those possessing names (sometimes even mere homophones) identical to the emperor's were frequently forced to change them. The normalization of personal names after the [[May Fourth Movement]] has generally eradicated aliases such as the school name and courtesy name but traces of the old taboos remain, particularly within families.\n\n==History==\nAlthough some terms in the ancient Chinese naming system, such as ''x\u00ecng'' ({{lang|zh|\u59d3}}) and ''m\u00edng'' ({{lang|zh|\u540d}}), are still used today, in ancient times they were used in different and more complex ways than in modern China.\n\nIn the first half of the 1st millennium BC, during  the [[Zhou dynasty]], members of the Chinese nobility could possess up to four different names{{mdash}}personal names (''m\u00edng'' {{lang|zh|\u540d}}), clan names (''x\u00ecng'' {{lang|zh|\u59d3}}), lineage names (''sh\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u6c0f}}), and \"style\" or \"courtesy\" names (''z\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u5b57}}){{mdash}} as well as up to two titles: standard titles (''ju\u00e9'' {{lang|zh|\u7235}}), and posthumous titles (''sh\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u8ae1}} or ''sh\u00ech\u00e0o'' {{lang|zh|\u8ae1\u865f}}).{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=113}}\n\n{{Pre\u2013Qin Chinese names}}\n\nCommoners possessed only a personal name (''ming''), and the modern concept of a \"surname\" or \"family name\" did not yet exist at any level of society.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=113}}  The old lineage (''shi'') and clan names (''xing'') began to become \"family names\" in the modern sense and trickle down to commoners around 500 BC, during the late [[Spring and Autumn period]], but the process took several centuries to complete, and it was not until the late [[Han dynasty]] (1st and 2nd centuries AD) that all Chinese commoners had surnames.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|pp=113-115}}\n\n== Family names ==\n{{Main|Chinese surname}}\nAlthough there are currently over 6,000 [[Chinese surname]]s including non-Han Chinese surnames ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59d3}}}}, ''x\u00ecng'') in use in China,<ref name=gbtimes>{{cite news |url=https://gbtimes.com/wang-is-the-most-common-surname-in-china |title=Wang is the most common surname in China |first= Asa |last=Butcher |date=31 January 2019 |work=GBTimes}}</ref> the colloquial expression for the \"Chinese people\" is  B\u01ceix\u00ecng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u767e\u59d3}}}}) \"[[Hundred Family Surnames|Hundred Surnames]]\", and a mere hundred surnames still make up over 85% of China's 1.3 billion citizens.<ref name=\"PD\">{{cite web|website=People's Daily |url=http://english.people.com.cn/200706/19/eng20070619_385661.html |title=Chinese surname shortage sparks rethink |date=19 May 2007 |access-date=16 March 2012}}</ref> In fact, just the top three\u2014[[Wang (surname)|Wang]] ({{lang|zh|\u738b}}), [[Li (\u674e)|Li]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u674e}}}}), and [[Zhang (surname)|Zhang]] ({{lang|zh|\u5f35}})\u2014cover more than 20% of the population.<ref name=\"PD\"/> This homogeneity results from the great majority of [[Han Chinese|Han]] family names having only one character, while the small number of [[Chinese compound surname|compound surnames]] is mostly restricted to minority groups.<ref name=\"Xinhua\">{{cite web |url=http://www.taiwan.cn/xwzx/jrbd/200712/t20071212_499876.htm |date=12 Dec 2007 |script-title=zh:\u6211\u56fd\u6c49\u65cf\u516c\u6c11\u6700\u957f\u59d3\u540d\u8fbe15\u5b57 \u516c\u5b89\u90e8\uff1a\u8d77\u540d\u4e0d\u89c4\u8303\u4f1a\u6709\u4e0d\u4fbf |website=taiwan.cn |access-date=16 March 2012 |language=zh}}</ref>\n\nChinese surnames arose from two separate [[Prehistoric China|prehistoric]] traditions: the ''[[Chinese family name|x\u00ecng]]'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59d3}}}}) and the ''[[Chinese clan name|sh\u00ec]]'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6c0f}}}}). The original ''x\u00ecng'' were clans of royalty at the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] court and always included the 'woman' [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5973}}}}. The ''sh\u00ec'' did not originate from families, but denoted fiefs, states, and titles granted or recognized by the Shang court. Apart from the [[Jiang (surname)|Jiang]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59dc}}}}) and [[Yao (surname)|Yao]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59da}}}}) families, the original ''x\u00ecng'' have nearly disappeared but the terms ironically reversed their meaning. ''X\u00ecng'' is now used to describe the ''sh\u00ec'' surnames which replaced them, while ''sh\u00ec'' is used to refer to [[maiden name]]s.\n\nThe enormous modern clans sometimes share [[tanghao|ancestral halls]] with one another, but actually consist of many different lineages gathered under a single name. As an example, the surname [[Ma (surname)|Ma]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u99ac}}}}) includes descendants of the [[Warring States period|Warring States]]\u2013era bureaucrat [[Zhao She]], descendants of his subjects in his fief of [[Mafu]], Koreans from an [[Mahan confederacy|unrelated confederation]], and Muslims from all over western China who chose it to honor [[Muhammad]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&pg=PA375|title=Muslim Chinese: Ethnic Nationalism in the People's Republic|author=[[Dru C.

This is still the norm in [[mainland China]], though the marriage law explicitly states that a child may use either parent's surname. It is also possible, though far less common, for a child to combine both parents' surnames. Due to Western influence, some areas of [[greater China]], such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], have also adopted the tradition of a woman changing her last name, or prepending her husband's to her own.\n\n== Given names ==\n{{Main|Chinese given name}}\nChinese given names ({{lang|zh|\u540d\u5b57}}, ''m\u00edngzi'') show much greater diversity than the surnames, while still being restricted almost universally to one or two syllables.

Given names are chosen based on a range of factors, including possession of pleasing sound and [[Chinese tones|tonal qualities]], as well as bearing positive associations or a beautiful shape. Two-character ''ming'' may be chosen for each character's separate meaning and qualities, but the name remains a single unit which is almost always said together even when the combination no longer 'means' anything.\n\nToday, two-character names are more common and make up more than 80% of Chinese names.<ref name=\"ABC\">Woo Louie, Emma & al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IGAClRACrsYC&pg=PA48 Chinese American Names: Tradition and Transition]''. McFarland, 2008. {{ISBN|0-7864-3877-0}}. Accessed 22 Mar 2012.</ref> However, this custom has been consistent only since the [[Ming dynasty]]. About 70% of all names were only one character long during the [[Western Han dynasty|early Han]] and that rose beyond 98% after the usurping [[Wang Mang]] banned all two-character names outright. Although his [[Xin dynasty]] was short-lived, the law was not repealed until 400 years later, when northern invasions and interest in establishing lineages revived interest in such longer names.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> The [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] saw populations with a majority of two-character names for the first time, but the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Liao]] between them and the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] afterward both preferred single character names. The restoration of [[Han people|Han]] dominance under the Ming, promotion of [[Han culture]] under the [[Qing]], and development of [[generation name]]s established the current traditions.<ref name=\"ABC\"/>\n\nGiven names resonant of qualities which are perceived to be either masculine or feminine are frequently given, with males being linked with strength and firmness and females with beauty and flowers. It is also more common for female names to employ diminutives like ''Xi\u01ceo'' or doubled characters in their formal names, although there are famous male examples such as [[Li Xiaoping]] and [[Yo-Yo Ma]]. People from the countryside previously often bore names that reflect rural life\u2014for example, Daniu ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5927|\u725b}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Big Bull\") and Dazhu ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5927|\u67f1}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Big Pole\")\u2014but such names are becoming less common.\n\nIt is also considered bad form to name a child after a famous person, although tens of thousands might happen to share a common name such as \"[[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]]\".<ref>{{cite web |author={{lang|zh|\u6cd5\u5236\u665a\u62a5(\u5317\u4eac)}} Legal Evening News (Beijing) |website=163.com |url=http://news.163.com/07/0815/15/3LUPHGL4000120GU.html |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd1.8\u4e07\u591a\u4eba\u59d3\u540d\u4e3a\u5218\u7fd4,\u53eb\u5218\u5fb7\u534e\u7684\u4eba\u903e1.6\u4e07 |date=15 October 2007 |access-date=17 March 2012 |language=zh}}</ref> Similarly, owing to the traditional [[naming taboo]]s, it is very uncommon in China to name a child directly after a relative, since such children would permit junior family members to inappropriately use the personal names of senior ones. Ancestors can leave a different kind of mark: Chinese naming schemes often employ a [[generation name]]. Every child recorded into the family records in each generation would share an identical character in their names. Sixteen, thirty-two, or more generations would be worked out in advance to form a [[generation poem]]. For example, the one selected in 1737 for the family of [[Mao Zedong]] read:{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7acb|\u663e|\u8363|\u671d|\u58eb}}}}\uff0c''Stand tall & display unstintingly before gentlemen,''\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6587|\u65b9|\u8fd0|\u9645|\u7965}}}}\u3002''And study & method will expand the borders of our fortune''.\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7956|\u6069|\u8d3b|\u6cfd|\u8fdc}}}}\uff0c''Ancestral favors bequeath kindness through the ages,''\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e16|\u4ee3|\u6c38|\u627f|\u660c}}}}\u3002''Descendants forever obliged for their prosperity''.\n\nThis scheme was in its fourteenth generation when Mao rejected it for the naming of his own children, preferring to give his sons the generational name An ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5cb8}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Lofty\", \"Proud\") instead.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} A similar practice was observed regarding the [[stage name]]s of [[Chinese opera]] performers: all the students entering a training academy in the same year would adopt the same first character in their new \"given name\". For example, as part of the class entering the National Drama School in 1933, [[Li Yuru]] adopted a name with the central character \"jade\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7389}}}}).<ref>{{citation |last=Li |first=Ruru |authormask=Li Ruru |contribution-url=https://chinoperl.osu.edu/sites/chinoperl.osu.edu/files/back-issues-no.29-liruru-caoyu-liyuru-report-color-photos.pdf |contribution=2010 Commemorations of the Theatrical Careers of Cao Yu and Li Yuru |date=2010b |title=CHINOPERL Papers |volume=No. 29 |publisher=Conference on Chinese Oral and Performing Literature |p=225 }}.</ref>\n\nDepending on the region and particular family, daughters were not entered into the family records and thus did not share the boys' generation name, although they may have borne a separate one among themselves. Even where generation names are not used, siblings' names are frequently related, so that a boy named Song ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u677e}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Pine\") might have a sister named Mei ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6885}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"[[plum tree|Plum]]\"). In some families, the siblings' names have the same [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]]. For example, in the Jia ({{lang|zh|\u8d3e}}) clan in ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'', a novel mirroring the rise and decline of the Qing Dynasty, there is Zheng ({{lang|zh|\u653f}}), She ({{lang|zh|\u8d66}}), and Min ({{lang|zh|\u654f}}) in the first generation, Lian ({{lang|zh|\u740f}}), Zhen ({{lang|zh|\u73cd}}), and Huan ({{lang|zh|\u73af}}) in the second, and Yun ({{lang|zh|\u82b8}}), Qin ({{lang|zh|\u82b9}}), and Lan ({{lang|zh|\u5170}}({{lang|zh|\u862d}} at the time)) in the third.\n\nMore recently, although generation names have become less common, many personal names reflect periods of [[History of China|Chinese history]]. For example, following the victory of the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] in the [[Chinese Civil War|Civil War]], many Chinese bore \"revolutionary names\" such as Qiangguo ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5f37|\u570b}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Strong Nation\" or \"Strengthening the Nation\") or Dongfeng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6771|\u98a8}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Eastern Wind\"). Similarly, on [[Taiwan]], it used to be common to incorporate one of the four characters of the name \"[[Republic of China]]\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef|\u6c11\u570b}}}}, ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3'') into masculine names. Periodic fad names like Aoyun (\"Olympics\") also appear. Owing to both effects, there has also been a recent trend in China to hire fortune tellers to change people's names to new ones more in accordance with traditional Taoist and [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five element]] practices. In creating a new Chinese name, it is sometimes the practice to analyze the number of strokes in the characters used in the potential name and attempt to use characters that produce specific totals of strokes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/number-of-stroke-chinese-names-2278472|title=Choosing a Chinese Name by Number of Strokes|author=Qiu Gui Su|date=8 March 2019|accessdate=26 July 2019|quote=The total number of strokes of the zh\u014dng g\u00e9 should equal 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 25, 29, 31, 32, 33, 37, 39, 45, 47, 48, 52, 63, 65, 67, 68, 73, or 81.}}</ref>\n\n==Spelling==\n{{Main|Pinyin|Romanization of Chinese}}\nThe process of converting Chinese names into a phonetic alphabet is called [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]].\n\nIn mainland China, Chinese names have been romanized using the [[Hanyu Pinyin]] system since 1958. Although experiments with the complete conversion of Chinese to the Pinyin alphabet failed,<ref name=\"F&F\">DeFrancis, John. ''[[The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy]]''.</ref> it remains in common use and has become the transcription system of the government of [[Singapore]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[International Organization for Standardization]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=13682|title=ISO 7098:1982 \u2013 Documentation \u2013 Romanization of Chinese|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> After many decades of avoiding its use, Taiwan formally adopted Pinyin as its \"New Phonetic System\" in 2009,<ref name=\"pinyin_tt\">{{cite news | newspaper=Taipei Times |date=2008-09-18 |title=Hanyu Pinyin to be standard system in 2009 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/09/18/2003423528 |accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"pinyin_cp\">{{cite news |newspaper=The China Post |date=2008-09-18 |title=Government to improve English-friendly environment |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/09/18/175155/Gov%27t-to.htm |accessdate=2008-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919054355/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/09/18/175155/Gov%27t%2Dto.htm |archive-date=2008-09-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> although it continues to allow its citizens to use other romanizations on official documents such as passports. The system is easily identified by its frequent use of letters uncommon in English, such as \"q\", \"x\", and \"z\"; when tones are included, they are noted via [[Pinyin#Tones|tone marks]]. In Pinyin, {{lang|zh|\u6bdb\u6fa4\u6771}} is written as M\u00e1o Z\u00e9d\u014dng.\n\nProper use of [[Pinyin]] means treating the surname and given name as precisely two separate words with no spaces between the letters of multiple Chinese characters. For example, \"{{lang|zh|\u738b\u79c0\u82f1}}\" is properly rendered either with its [[Pinyin#Tones|tone marks]] as \"W\u00e1ng Xi\u00f9y\u012bng\" or without as \"Wang Xiuying\", but should not be written as \"Wang Xiu Ying\", \"Wang XiuYing\", \"Wangxiuying\", and so on. In the rare cases where a surname consists of more than one character, it too should be written as a unit: \"[[Sima Qian]]\", not \"Si Ma Qian\" or \"Si Maqian\". However, as the Chinese language makes almost no use of spaces, native speakers often do not know these rules and simply put a space between each Chinese character of their name, causing those used to alphabetical languages to think of the ''xing'' and ''ming'' as three words instead of two.\n\nThe switch to Pinyin is still quite new for Taiwan and many non-standard spellings continue to be found, including \"Lee\" and \"Soong\". Similarly, many Taiwanese and historic names still employ the older [[Wade\u2013Giles]] system. This [[English language|English]]-influenced system is identified by its use of the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s \"hs\" (for the pinyin ''x'') and \"ts\" (for the pinyin ''z'' and ''c'') and by its use of hyphens to connect the syllables of multi-character words. Correct reading depends on the inclusion of superscript numbers and the use of apostrophes to distinguish between different consonants, but in practice both of these are commonly omitted. In Wade\u2013Giles, {{lang|zh|\u6bdb\u6fa4\u6771}} is written as [[Mao Tse-tung]], as the system hyphenates names between the characters. For example, Wang Xiuying and Sima Qian are written in Wade as \"Wang<sup>2</sup> Hsiu<sup>4</sup>-Ying<sup>1</sup>\" and \"Ssu<sup>1</sup>Ma<sup>3</sup> Ch'ien<sup>1</sup>\".\n\nPinyin and Wade\u2013Giles both represent the pronunciation of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], based on the [[Beijing dialect]]. In [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and the [[Chinese diaspora|diaspora]] communities in southeast Asia and abroad, the Chinese often romanize according to the sounds of their own local Chinese dialect or lingua franca or language mostly spoken in the area or country they settled into, particularly [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], [[Hokkien]], and [[Hakka language|Hakka]]. This occurs amid a plethora of competing romanization systems. In Hong Kong, many Chinese who grew up during British colonial rule adopted English spelling conventions for their names: \"Lee\" for {{lang|zh|\u674e}}, \"Shaw\" for {{lang|zh|\u90b5}}, and so forth. In Macau, Chinese names are similarly sometimes still transliterated based on [[Portuguese orthography]] and [[Jyutping]]. The Chinese from [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and the diaspora communities in Malaysia and Singapore fully divide the characters in their names with spaces as a matter of course.\n\nA final point is that\u2014although characters have remained roughly the same since the Han dynasty and some [[Classical Chinese|classical grammar]] is still part of the core curriculum of Chinese secondary schools\u2014vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation have all changed from [[Old Chinese|Old]] to [[Middle Chinese|Middle]] to [[Written Vernacular Chinese|Modern Chinese]] even within the [[prestige dialect]]s. Thus, although modern Chinese read \"Confucius\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b54|\u592b\u5b50}}}}) as ''K\u01d2ng F\u016bz\u01d0'', the same name would have been ''Khuwng Pjutsi'' in the Tang dynasty and was probably something like an atonal ''Khong\u0294 Pats\u0259\u0294'' during his lifetime.<ref name=\"BaxSag\">Baxter, Wm.

As a result, the upper classes of traditional Chinese culture typically employed a variety of names over the course of their lives, and the [[table of Chinese monarchs|emperors]] and [[ancestor veneration in China|sanctified deceased]] had still others.\n\nCurrent naming practices are more straightforward and consistent, but a few pseudonyms or alternate names remain common.\n\nWhen discussing Chinese writers, Chinese and Japanese scholars do not consistently use particular names, whether they are private names or alternative names.<ref>Chan, Wing-tsit.

The milk name may be abandoned but is often continued as a form of familial nickname. A tradition sometimes attached to the milk name is to select an unpleasant name, in order to ward off demons who might wish to harm the child.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Teresa|title=A World of Baby Names|year=2003|publisher=The Berkeley Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-399-52894-1|url=https://archive.org/details/worldofbabynames00norm_1}}</ref>\n\n===Nickname===\n[[Nickname]]s ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u7dbd\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u7ef0\u53f7}}|p=chu\u00f2h\u00e0o}}, or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5916\u865f}}}}, ''w\u00e0ih\u00e0o'') are acquired in China in much the same way they are in other countries. Not everyone has one. Most that do received theirs in childhood or adolescence from family or friends. Common Chinese nicknames are those based on a person's physical attributes, speaking style, or behavior. Names involving animals are common, although those animals may be associated with different attributes than they are in English: for example, Chinese cows are strong, not stupid; foxes are devious, not clever; pigs are ugly, lazy, stupid, or content, but not dirty. Similarly, nicknames that might seem especially insulting in English\u2014such as \"Little Fatty\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c0f\u80d6}}}})\u2014are more acceptable in Chinese. One especially common method of creating nicknames is prefixing ''\u0100-'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u963f}}}}) or ''Xi\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c0f}}}}) to the surname or the second character of the given name. ''\u0100-'' is more common in southern China and abroad, while ''Xi\u01ceo'' is common throughout China. Both ''\u0100-'' and ''Xi\u01ceo'' are distinguished from ''L\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8001}}}}, \"old\" but [[#Forms of address|see below]] for usage). Nicknames are rarely used in formal or semi-formal settings, although a famous exception is [[Chen Shui-bian|A-bian]].\n\n===Western name===\nEnglish is taught throughout China's secondary schools and the English language section is a required component of the ''[[Gaokao]]'', China's college entrance examination. Many Chinese teenagers thus acquire Western names, commonly of English origin, which they may keep and use as nicknames even in Chinese-language contexts. Chinese may adopt English names for a variety of reasons, including foreigners' difficulty with [[Chinese tones]] and better integration of people working in foreign enterprises. The freedom associated with choosing a Chinese given name sometimes leads to choosing English names which seem bizarre to native English speakers. Names taken from nouns are relatively common, such as Chlorophyll, Candy, Devil or Whale.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Established English names chosen by Chinese may also be those rarely used by native English speakers.<ref>\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/hong-kong-loves-weird-english-names/263103/</ref> Creative names made and adopted by [[Hongkongers]] are generated by modifying normal English names either by deleting, inserting or substituting specific letters (e.g. Kith, Sonija, Garbie) or by mimicking the phonetic sounds of the Chinese name (e.g. [[Hacken Lee]] from Lee Hak-kan ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u514b\u52e4}})).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hksarblog.blogspot.com/|title=NOTABLE NAMES (Brilliant Funny Weird Monikers)|website=hksarblog.blogspot.com|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\nIn Hong Kong, because of its one and a half century [[British Hong Kong|British rule]], many Hong Kong people will pick English names as early as attending English classes in kindergarten, or even have the English alias embedded in official documentation. One example is actor Chan Kong-sang, who in English goes by the name [[Jackie Chan]]. The English aliases are widely used at schools and at work. Similar to [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] people of Chinese descent, which shares a similar historical development, it is very common among [[Hongkongers]] to address each other with an English alias. An English alias can be accepted as part of the name in official documentation, but whether to include such is an option to individuals.\n\nIt is also becoming more popular for parents to give their child a middle name in between their given name and family name, similar to many Western traditions.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===School name===\nThe school name ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u5b78\u540d}}|s={{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b66\u540d}}|p=xu\u00e9m\u00edng}}}}) was a separate formal name used by the child while they were at school.\n\nAs [[binomial nomenclature]] is also called ''xu\u00e9m\u00edng'' in Chinese, the school name is also sometimes now referenced as the ''x\u00f9nm\u00edng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8a13\u540d}}}}) to avoid confusion.\n\n===Courtesy name===\n{{Main|Courtesy name}}\n\nUpon maturity, it was common for educated males to acquire a [[courtesy name]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b57}}}}, ''z\u00ec'' or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8868\u5b57}}}}, ''bi\u01ceoz\u00ec'') either from one's parents, a teacher, or self-selection. The name commonly mirrored the meaning of one's given name or displayed his birth order within his family.\n\nThe practice was a consequence of admonitions in the ''[[Book of Rites]]'' that among adults it is disrespectful to be addressed by one's given name by others within the same generation. The true given name was reserved for the use of one's elders, while the courtesy name was employed by peers on formal occasions and in writing. The practice was decried by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and has been largely abandoned.\n\n===Pseudonym===\n{{Main|Art name}}\n\nPseudonyms or aliases ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u53f7}}|p=h\u00e0o}}) or pen names ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u7b46\u540d}}|s={{linktext|\u7b14\u540d}}|p=b\u01d0m\u00edng}}) were self-selected alternative courtesy names, most commonly three or four characters long. They may have originated from too many people having the same courtesy name.\n\nSome\u2014but by no means most\u2014authors do continue to employ stylized pen names. A noted{{dubious|date=May 2012}} example is the exile and dissident poet [[Zhao Zhenkai]], whose pen name is \"Bei Dao\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5317|\u5c9b}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"North Island\").\n\n===Posthumous name===\n{{Main|Posthumous name}}\n\nPosthumous names ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u8ae1\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u8c25\u53f7}}|p=sh\u00ech\u00e0o}}) were honorary names selected after a person's death, used extensively for royalty. The common \"names\" of most Chinese emperors before the [[Tang dynasty]]\u2014with the pointed exception of [[Shi Huangdi]]\u2014are their posthumous ones. In addition to emperors, successful courtiers and politicians such as [[Sun Yat-sen]] also occasionally received posthumous titles.\n\n===Temple name===\n{{Main|Temple name}}\n{{See also|Ancestor veneration in China}}\n\nThe temple name ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u5edf\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u5e99\u53f7}}|p='mi\u00e0oh\u00e0o}}) of the emperor inscribed on the [[spiritual tablet]]s of the [[imperial ancestral temple]] often differed from his posthumous name. The structure eventually became highly restricted, consisting of a single adjective and either ''z\u01d4'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7956}}}}) or ''z\u014dng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b97}}}}). These common \"names\" of the emperors between the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] are their temple ones.\n\n===Era name===\n{{Main|Chinese era name|Table of Chinese monarchs}}\n\nThe era name ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5e74\u865f}}}}, ''ni\u00e1nh\u00e0o'') arose from the custom of dating years by the reigns of the ruling emperors. Under the [[Han dynasty|Han]], the practice began of changing [[regnal name]]s as means of dispensing with bad luck and attracting better. Almost all era names were literary and employed exactly two characters. By the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, emperors had largely dispensed with the practice and kept a single era name during their reign, such that it is customary to refer to Ming and Qing emperors by their era names.\n\n== Forms of address ==\nWithin families, it is often considered inappropriate or even offensive to use the given names of relatives who are senior to the speaker. Instead, it is more customary to identify each family member by abstract hierarchical connections: among siblings, gender and birth order (big sister, second sister, and so on); for the extended family, the manner of relationship (by birth or marriage; from the maternal or paternal side).\n\nThe hierarchical titles of junior relatives are seldom used except in formal situations, or as indirect reference when speaking to family members who are even younger than the person in question. Children can be called by their given names, or their parents may use their nicknames.\n\nWhen speaking of non-family social acquaintances, people are generally referred to by a title, for example Mother Li ({{zh|t=\u674e\u5abd\u5abd|s=\u674e\u5988\u5988|p=l\u01d0 m\u0101ma}}) or Mrs. Zhu ({{lang|zh|\u6731\u592a\u592a}}, {{zh|p=zh\u016b t\u00e0itai}}). Personal names are used when referring to adult friends or to children, although, unlike in the west, referring to somebody by their full name (including surname) is common even among friends, especially if the person's full name is only two syllables.  It is common to refer to a person as ''l\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|\u8001}}, old) or ''xi\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|\u5c0f}}, young) followed by their family name, thus L\u01ceo W\u00e1ng ({{lang|zh|\u8001\u738b}}) or Xi\u01ceo Zh\u0101ng ({{lang|zh|\u5c0f\u5f35, \u5c0f\u5f20}}).  Xi\u01ceo is also frequently used as a diminutive, when it is typically paired with the second or only character in a person's name, rather than the surname.  Note that because old people are well respected in Chinese society, ''l\u01ceo'' (old) does not carry disrespect, offense or any negative implications even if it is used to refer to an older woman.  Despite this, it is advisable for non-Chinese to avoid calling a person xi\u01ceo-something or l\u01ceo-something unless they are so-called by other Chinese people and it is clear that the appellation is acceptable and widely used.  Otherwise, the use of the person's full name, or alternatively, their surname followed by xi\u0101nsheng ({{zh|c=\u5148\u751f}}, mister) or n\u01dash\u00ec ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u5973\u58eb}}, madam) is relatively neutral and unlikely to cause offense.\n\nWithin school settings and when addressing former classmates, it is common to refer to them as older siblings, e.g. elder brother Zhao ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u8d99\u54e5|s=\u8d75\u54e5|p=Zh\u00e0o G\u00e9}}) or e.g. elder sister Zhang ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u5f35\u59d0|s=\u5f20\u59d0|p=Zh\u0101ng J\u01d0e}}) if they were of senior classes, or simply to show respect or closeness. The opposite (e.g. younger brother Zhao) is rarely used. This custom spawns from traditional forms of respectful address, where it was considered rude to directly address your seniors.\n\nWhereas [[title]]s in many cultures are commonly solely determined by gender and, in some cases, marital status, the occupation or even work title of a person can be used as a title as a sign of respect in common address in Chinese culture. Because of the prestigious position of a teacher in traditional culture, a teacher is invariably addressed as such by his or her students (e.g. {{zh|labels=no|c=\u674e\u8001\u5e2b|p=L\u01d0 L\u01ceosh\u012b|l=Teacher Li}}), and commonly by others as a mark of respect. Where applicable, \"Teacher Surname\" is considered more respectful than \"Mr/Mrs/Miss Surname\" in Chinese. A professor is also commonly addressed as \"teacher\", though \"professor\" is also accepted as a respectful title. By extension, a junior or less experienced member of a work place or profession would address a more senior member as \"Teacher\".\n\nSimilarly, engineers are often addressed as such, though often shortened to simply the first character of the word \"engineer\" -- {{zh|c=\u5de5|p=G\u014dng}}. Should the person being addressed be the head of a company (or simply the middle manager of another company to whom you would like to show respect), one might equally address them by the title \"z\u014fng\" ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u603b|t=\u7e3d}}), which means \"general\" or \"overall\", and is the first character of titles such as \"Director General\" or \"General Manager\" (e.g. {{zh|labels=no|t=\u674e\u7e3d|s=\u674e\u603b|p=L\u012d z\u014fng}}), or, if they are slightly lower down on the corporate hierarchy but nonetheless a manager, by affixing J\u012bngl\u012d ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u7ecf\u7406|t=\u7d93\u7406}}, manager).\n\n== Variations ==\n\n===Unusual names===\n{{see also|Naming laws in the People's Republic of China}}\nBecause the small number of Chinese surnames leads to confusion in social environments, and because some Chinese parents have a desire to give individuality, some Chinese have received unusual given names. As of April 2009, about 60 million Chinese people have unusual characters in their names. A 2006 report by the [[Chinese public security bureau]] stated that of about 55,000 Chinese characters used in the People's Republic of China, only 32,232 of those are supported by the ministry's computers. The PRC government has asked individuals with unusual names to change them so they can get new computer-readable public identity cards, and the diversity prevents them from receiving new identity cards if they do not change their names.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nBeginning in at least 2003, the PRC government has been writing a list of standardized characters for everyday usage in life, which would be the pool of characters to select from when a child is given his or her name. Originally the limits were to go in place in 2005. In April 2009, the list had been revised 70 times, and it still has not been put into effect.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nWang Daliang, a [[China Youth University for Political Sciences]] linguistics scholar, said that \"Using obscure names to avoid duplication of names or to be unique is not good. Now a lot of people are perplexed by their names. The computer cannot even recognize them and people cannot read them. This has become an obstacle in communication.\"<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Zhou Youyong, the dean of the [[Southeast University]] law school, argued that the ability to choose the name of one's children is a fundamental right, so the PRC government should be careful when making new naming laws.<ref name=\"Xinhua\"/>\n\nWhile the vast majority of Han Chinese names consist of two or three characters, there are some Han Chinese with longer names, up to 15 characters.<ref name=\"Xinhua\"/> In addition, [[Transcription into Chinese characters|transliteration of ethnic languages into Chinese characters]] often results in long names.\n\n===Taiwan===\n[[Han Chinese|Han]] family names in Taiwan are similar to those in southeast China, as most families trace their origins to places such as [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]].  [[Indigenous Taiwanese]] have also been forced [[Naming customs of Taiwanese aborigines|to adopt Chinese names]] as part of enforced [[Sinicization]]. The popularity distribution of family names in Taiwan as a whole differs somewhat from the distribution of names among all Han Chinese, with the family name [[Chen (surname)|Chen]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u9673}}}}) being particularly more common (about 11% on Taiwan, compared with about 3% on the Mainland). Local variations also exist.\n\nGiven names that consist of one character are much less common on Taiwan than on the mainland.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nA traditional practice, now largely supplanted, was choosing deliberately unpleasant given names to ward off bad omens and evil spirits. For example, a boy facing a serious illness might be renamed Ti-s\u00e1i ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c6c|\u5c4e}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Pig Shit\") to indicate to the evil spirits that he was not worth their trouble. Similarly, a girl from a poor family might have the name B\u00f3ng-ch\u012b ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7f54|\u5e02}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"No Takers\").\n\nNicknames ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u56dd|\u4ed4|\u540d}}}}, ''g\u00edn-\u00e1-mi\u00e2'', \"child names\") are common and generally adopt the [[nanfangren|Southern Chinese]] practice of affixing the prefix \"A-\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u963f}}}}) to the last syllable of a person's name. Although these names are rarely used in formal contexts, there are a few public figures who are well known by their nicknames, including former president [[Chen Shui-bian|A-bian]] and the singer [[A-mei]].\n\n===Diaspora===\nAmong [[Chinese American]]s, it is common practice to be referred to primarily by the Western name and to use the Chinese given name as an often-omitted [[middle name]].\n\nIn [[Malaysian Chinese|Malaysia]] and [[Chinese Singaporean|Singapore]], it is equally acceptable for Western names to appear before or after the Chinese given name, in Latin characters. Thus, the [[President of Singapore|Singaporean President]] [[Tony Tan Keng Yam|Tony Tan]] might see his name written as \"Tony Tan Keng Yam\" or \"Tan Keng Yam Tony\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Individuals are free to register their [[legal name]]s in either format on their [[National Registration Identity Card|identity card]]s. In general use, the English name first version is typically preferred as it keeps the correct order for both systems; however, for administrative purposes, the [[Government of Singapore|government]] [[Organisations of the Singapore Government|agencies]] tend to place the English name last to organize lists of names and databases more easily, similar to the Western practice of organizing names with the last name first followed by a comma (\"Smith, John\").\n\nThe [[Hong Kong]] printed media tend to adopt the hybrid name style\u2014for example, [[Andy Lau Tak-wah]]\u2014although some people prefer American-style middle names, such as [[Steven N. S. Cheung]], or simply use English names like [[Henry Lee (actor)|Henry Lee]]. On official records such as the Hong Kong [[identity document|Identity Cards]], family names are always printed first in all-caps Latin characters and followed by a comma for all names, including Chinese ones. Thus, the examples above would have identity cards that read \"LAU, Tak-wah Andy\" or \"CHEUNG, Steven Ng-sheong\", with the position of the given names determined at the time of application. Non-Chinese names are printed in similar style: \"DOE, Jane\".\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], one of the country with the most [[Chinese diaspora]] population, the [[Indonesian Chinese]] in Indonesia and in diaspora has mostly adopted [[Chinese Indonesian surname|Indonesian-sounding Chinese names]] due to centuries of regulation and acculturation. Conversely, the usage of these Indonesian-sounding Chinese names are not restricted for surnames, and many are used liberally between other surnames since many Indonesian Chinese didn't keep track their Chinese (sur)names anymore, and even used by non-Chinese people (with some names being borrowing from regional languages and names).\n\n==In English==\n[[File:Sun Yat Sen Signature.png|thumb|The signature of [[Sun Yat-sen]]; in English Chinese people usually keep their names in Chinese order unless they live or travel abroad]]\nChinese people, except for those traveling or living outside China, rarely reverse their names to the western naming order (given name, then family name). Western publications usually preserve the Chinese naming order, with the family name first, followed by the given name.

Due to China's historical dominance of East Asian culture, many names used in [[Korean name|Korea]] and [[Vietnamese name|Vietnam]] are adaptations of Chinese names, or have historical roots in Chinese, with appropriate adaptation to accommodate linguistic differences.\n\nModern Chinese names consist of a surname known as '''xing''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59d3}}}}, ''x\u00ecng''), which comes first and is usually but [[Chinese compound surname|not always]] monosyllabic, followed by a personal name called '''ming''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u540d}}}}, ''m\u00edng''), which is nearly always mono- or disyllabic.  Prior to the 20th century, educated Chinese also utilized a \"[[courtesy name]]\" or \"style name\" called '''zi''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b57}}}}, ''z\u00ec'') by which they were known among those outside their family and closest friends.\n\nFrom at least the time of the [[Shang dynasty]], the [[Han people|Chinese]] observed a number of [[naming taboo]]s regulating who may or may not use a person's given name (without being disrespectful). In general, using the given name connoted the speaker's authority and superior position to the addressee. Peers and younger relatives were barred from speaking it. Owing to this, many historical Chinese figures\u2014particularly emperors\u2014used a half-dozen or more different names in different contexts and for different speakers. Those possessing names (sometimes even mere homophones) identical to the emperor's were frequently forced to change them. The normalization of personal names after the [[May Fourth Movement]] has generally eradicated aliases such as the school name and courtesy name but traces of the old taboos remain, particularly within families.\n\n==History==\nAlthough some terms in the ancient Chinese naming system, such as ''x\u00ecng'' ({{lang|zh|\u59d3}}) and ''m\u00edng'' ({{lang|zh|\u540d}}), are still used today, in ancient times they were used in different and more complex ways than in modern China.\n\nIn the first half of the 1st millennium BC, during  the [[Zhou dynasty]], members of the Chinese nobility could possess up to four different names{{mdash}}personal names (''m\u00edng'' {{lang|zh|\u540d}}), clan names (''x\u00ecng'' {{lang|zh|\u59d3}}), lineage names (''sh\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u6c0f}}), and \"style\" or \"courtesy\" names (''z\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u5b57}}){{mdash}} as well as up to two titles: standard titles (''ju\u00e9'' {{lang|zh|\u7235}}), and posthumous titles (''sh\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u8ae1}} or ''sh\u00ech\u00e0o'' {{lang|zh|\u8ae1\u865f}}).{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=113}}\n\n{{Pre\u2013Qin Chinese names}}\n\nCommoners possessed only a personal name (''ming''), and the modern concept of a \"surname\" or \"family name\" did not yet exist at any level of society.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=113}}  The old lineage (''shi'') and clan names (''xing'') began to become \"family names\" in the modern sense and trickle down to commoners around 500 BC, during the late [[Spring and Autumn period]], but the process took several centuries to complete, and it was not until the late [[Han dynasty]] (1st and 2nd centuries AD) that all Chinese commoners had surnames.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|pp=113-115}}\n\n== Family names ==\n{{Main|Chinese surname}}\nAlthough there are currently over 6,000 [[Chinese surname]]s including non-Han Chinese surnames ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59d3}}}}, ''x\u00ecng'') in use in China,<ref name=gbtimes>{{cite news |url=https://gbtimes.com/wang-is-the-most-common-surname-in-china |title=Wang is the most common surname in China |first= Asa |last=Butcher |date=31 January 2019 |work=GBTimes}}</ref> the colloquial expression for the \"Chinese people\" is  B\u01ceix\u00ecng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u767e\u59d3}}}}) \"[[Hundred Family Surnames|Hundred Surnames]]\", and a mere hundred surnames still make up over 85% of China's 1.3 billion citizens.<ref name=\"PD\">{{cite web|website=People's Daily |url=http://english.people.com.cn/200706/19/eng20070619_385661.html |title=Chinese surname shortage sparks rethink |date=19 May 2007 |access-date=16 March 2012}}</ref> In fact, just the top three\u2014[[Wang (surname)|Wang]] ({{lang|zh|\u738b}}), [[Li (\u674e)|Li]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u674e}}}}), and [[Zhang (surname)|Zhang]] ({{lang|zh|\u5f35}})\u2014cover more than 20% of the population.<ref name=\"PD\"/> This homogeneity results from the great majority of [[Han Chinese|Han]] family names having only one character, while the small number of [[Chinese compound surname|compound surnames]] is mostly restricted to minority groups.<ref name=\"Xinhua\">{{cite web |url=http://www.taiwan.cn/xwzx/jrbd/200712/t20071212_499876.htm |date=12 Dec 2007 |script-title=zh:\u6211\u56fd\u6c49\u65cf\u516c\u6c11\u6700\u957f\u59d3\u540d\u8fbe15\u5b57 \u516c\u5b89\u90e8\uff1a\u8d77\u540d\u4e0d\u89c4\u8303\u4f1a\u6709\u4e0d\u4fbf |website=taiwan.cn |access-date=16 March 2012 |language=zh}}</ref>\n\nChinese surnames arose from two separate [[Prehistoric China|prehistoric]] traditions: the ''[[Chinese family name|x\u00ecng]]'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59d3}}}}) and the ''[[Chinese clan name|sh\u00ec]]'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6c0f}}}}). The original ''x\u00ecng'' were clans of royalty at the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] court and always included the 'woman' [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5973}}}}. The ''sh\u00ec'' did not originate from families, but denoted fiefs, states, and titles granted or recognized by the Shang court. Apart from the [[Jiang (surname)|Jiang]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59dc}}}}) and [[Yao (surname)|Yao]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59da}}}}) families, the original ''x\u00ecng'' have nearly disappeared but the terms ironically reversed their meaning. ''X\u00ecng'' is now used to describe the ''sh\u00ec'' surnames which replaced them, while ''sh\u00ec'' is used to refer to [[maiden name]]s.\n\nThe enormous modern clans sometimes share [[tanghao|ancestral halls]] with one another, but actually consist of many different lineages gathered under a single name. As an example, the surname [[Ma (surname)|Ma]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u99ac}}}}) includes descendants of the [[Warring States period|Warring States]]\u2013era bureaucrat [[Zhao She]], descendants of his subjects in his fief of [[Mafu]], Koreans from an [[Mahan confederacy|unrelated confederation]], and Muslims from all over western China who chose it to honor [[Muhammad]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&pg=PA375|title=Muslim Chinese: Ethnic Nationalism in the People's Republic|author=[[Dru C.

This is still the norm in [[mainland China]], though the marriage law explicitly states that a child may use either parent's surname. It is also possible, though far less common, for a child to combine both parents' surnames. Due to Western influence, some areas of [[greater China]], such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], have also adopted the tradition of a woman changing her last name, or prepending her husband's to her own.\n\n== Given names ==\n{{Main|Chinese given name}}\nChinese given names ({{lang|zh|\u540d\u5b57}}, ''m\u00edngzi'') show much greater diversity than the surnames, while still being restricted almost universally to one or two syllables.

Given names are chosen based on a range of factors, including possession of pleasing sound and [[Chinese tones|tonal qualities]], as well as bearing positive associations or a beautiful shape. Two-character ''ming'' may be chosen for each character's separate meaning and qualities, but the name remains a single unit which is almost always said together even when the combination no longer 'means' anything.\n\nToday, two-character names are more common and make up more than 80% of Chinese names.<ref name=\"ABC\">Woo Louie, Emma & al.

Accessed 22 Mar 2012.</ref> However, this custom has been consistent only since the [[Ming dynasty]]. About 70% of all names were only one character long during the [[Western Han dynasty|early Han]] and that rose beyond 98% after the usurping [[Wang Mang]] banned all two-character names outright. Although his [[Xin dynasty]] was short-lived, the law was not repealed until 400 years later, when northern invasions and interest in establishing lineages revived interest in such longer names.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> The [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] saw populations with a majority of two-character names for the first time, but the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Liao]] between them and the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] afterward both preferred single character names. The restoration of [[Han people|Han]] dominance under the Ming, promotion of [[Han culture]] under the [[Qing]], and development of [[generation name]]s established the current traditions.<ref name=\"ABC\"/>\n\nGiven names resonant of qualities which are perceived to be either masculine or feminine are frequently given, with males being linked with strength and firmness and females with beauty and flowers. It is also more common for female names to employ diminutives like ''Xi\u01ceo'' or doubled characters in their formal names, although there are famous male examples such as [[Li Xiaoping]] and [[Yo-Yo Ma]]. People from the countryside previously often bore names that reflect rural life\u2014for example, Daniu ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5927|\u725b}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Big Bull\") and Dazhu ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5927|\u67f1}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Big Pole\")\u2014but such names are becoming less common.\n\nIt is also considered bad form to name a child after a famous person, although tens of thousands might happen to share a common name such as \"[[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]]\".<ref>{{cite web |author={{lang|zh|\u6cd5\u5236\u665a\u62a5(\u5317\u4eac)}} Legal Evening News (Beijing) |website=163.com |url=http://news.163.com/07/0815/15/3LUPHGL4000120GU.html |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd1.8\u4e07\u591a\u4eba\u59d3\u540d\u4e3a\u5218\u7fd4,\u53eb\u5218\u5fb7\u534e\u7684\u4eba\u903e1.6\u4e07 |date=15 October 2007 |access-date=17 March 2012 |language=zh}}</ref> Similarly, owing to the traditional [[naming taboo]]s, it is very uncommon in China to name a child directly after a relative, since such children would permit junior family members to inappropriately use the personal names of senior ones. Ancestors can leave a different kind of mark: Chinese naming schemes often employ a [[generation name]]. Every child recorded into the family records in each generation would share an identical character in their names. Sixteen, thirty-two, or more generations would be worked out in advance to form a [[generation poem]]. For example, the one selected in 1737 for the family of [[Mao Zedong]] read:{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7acb|\u663e|\u8363|\u671d|\u58eb}}}}\uff0c''Stand tall & display unstintingly before gentlemen,''\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6587|\u65b9|\u8fd0|\u9645|\u7965}}}}\u3002''And study & method will expand the borders of our fortune''.\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7956|\u6069|\u8d3b|\u6cfd|\u8fdc}}}}\uff0c''Ancestral favors bequeath kindness through the ages,''\n::::{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e16|\u4ee3|\u6c38|\u627f|\u660c}}}}\u3002''Descendants forever obliged for their prosperity''.\n\nThis scheme was in its fourteenth generation when Mao rejected it for the naming of his own children, preferring to give his sons the generational name An ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5cb8}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Lofty\", \"Proud\") instead.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} A similar practice was observed regarding the [[stage name]]s of [[Chinese opera]] performers: all the students entering a training academy in the same year would adopt the same first character in their new \"given name\". For example, as part of the class entering the National Drama School in 1933, [[Li Yuru]] adopted a name with the central character \"jade\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7389}}}}).<ref>{{citation |last=Li |first=Ruru |authormask=Li Ruru |contribution-url=https://chinoperl.osu.edu/sites/chinoperl.osu.edu/files/back-issues-no.29-liruru-caoyu-liyuru-report-color-photos.pdf |contribution=2010 Commemorations of the Theatrical Careers of Cao Yu and Li Yuru |date=2010b |title=CHINOPERL Papers |volume=No. 29 |publisher=Conference on Chinese Oral and Performing Literature |p=225 }}.</ref>\n\nDepending on the region and particular family, daughters were not entered into the family records and thus did not share the boys' generation name, although they may have borne a separate one among themselves. Even where generation names are not used, siblings' names are frequently related, so that a boy named Song ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u677e}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Pine\") might have a sister named Mei ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6885}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"[[plum tree|Plum]]\"). In some families, the siblings' names have the same [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]]. For example, in the Jia ({{lang|zh|\u8d3e}}) clan in ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'', a novel mirroring the rise and decline of the Qing Dynasty, there is Zheng ({{lang|zh|\u653f}}), She ({{lang|zh|\u8d66}}), and Min ({{lang|zh|\u654f}}) in the first generation, Lian ({{lang|zh|\u740f}}), Zhen ({{lang|zh|\u73cd}}), and Huan ({{lang|zh|\u73af}}) in the second, and Yun ({{lang|zh|\u82b8}}), Qin ({{lang|zh|\u82b9}}), and Lan ({{lang|zh|\u5170}}({{lang|zh|\u862d}} at the time)) in the third.\n\nMore recently, although generation names have become less common, many personal names reflect periods of [[History of China|Chinese history]]. For example, following the victory of the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] in the [[Chinese Civil War|Civil War]], many Chinese bore \"revolutionary names\" such as Qiangguo ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5f37|\u570b}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Strong Nation\" or \"Strengthening the Nation\") or Dongfeng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6771|\u98a8}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Eastern Wind\"). Similarly, on [[Taiwan]], it used to be common to incorporate one of the four characters of the name \"[[Republic of China]]\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef|\u6c11\u570b}}}}, ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3'') into masculine names. Periodic fad names like Aoyun (\"Olympics\") also appear. Owing to both effects, there has also been a recent trend in China to hire fortune tellers to change people's names to new ones more in accordance with traditional Taoist and [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five element]] practices. In creating a new Chinese name, it is sometimes the practice to analyze the number of strokes in the characters used in the potential name and attempt to use characters that produce specific totals of strokes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/number-of-stroke-chinese-names-2278472|title=Choosing a Chinese Name by Number of Strokes|author=Qiu Gui Su|date=8 March 2019|accessdate=26 July 2019|quote=The total number of strokes of the zh\u014dng g\u00e9 should equal 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 25, 29, 31, 32, 33, 37, 39, 45, 47, 48, 52, 63, 65, 67, 68, 73, or 81.}}</ref>\n\n==Spelling==\n{{Main|Pinyin|Romanization of Chinese}}\nThe process of converting Chinese names into a phonetic alphabet is called [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]].\n\nIn mainland China, Chinese names have been romanized using the [[Hanyu Pinyin]] system since 1958. Although experiments with the complete conversion of Chinese to the Pinyin alphabet failed,<ref name=\"F&F\">DeFrancis, John. ''[[The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy]]''.</ref> it remains in common use and has become the transcription system of the government of [[Singapore]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[International Organization for Standardization]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=13682|title=ISO 7098:1982 \u2013 Documentation \u2013 Romanization of Chinese|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> After many decades of avoiding its use, Taiwan formally adopted Pinyin as its \"New Phonetic System\" in 2009,<ref name=\"pinyin_tt\">{{cite news | newspaper=Taipei Times |date=2008-09-18 |title=Hanyu Pinyin to be standard system in 2009 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/09/18/2003423528 |accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name=\"pinyin_cp\">{{cite news |newspaper=The China Post |date=2008-09-18 |title=Government to improve English-friendly environment |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/09/18/175155/Gov%27t-to.htm |accessdate=2008-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919054355/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/09/18/175155/Gov%27t%2Dto.htm |archive-date=2008-09-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> although it continues to allow its citizens to use other romanizations on official documents such as passports. The system is easily identified by its frequent use of letters uncommon in English, such as \"q\", \"x\", and \"z\"; when tones are included, they are noted via [[Pinyin#Tones|tone marks]]. In Pinyin, {{lang|zh|\u6bdb\u6fa4\u6771}} is written as M\u00e1o Z\u00e9d\u014dng.\n\nProper use of [[Pinyin]] means treating the surname and given name as precisely two separate words with no spaces between the letters of multiple Chinese characters. For example, \"{{lang|zh|\u738b\u79c0\u82f1}}\" is properly rendered either with its [[Pinyin#Tones|tone marks]] as \"W\u00e1ng Xi\u00f9y\u012bng\" or without as \"Wang Xiuying\", but should not be written as \"Wang Xiu Ying\", \"Wang XiuYing\", \"Wangxiuying\", and so on. In the rare cases where a surname consists of more than one character, it too should be written as a unit: \"[[Sima Qian]]\", not \"Si Ma Qian\" or \"Si Maqian\". However, as the Chinese language makes almost no use of spaces, native speakers often do not know these rules and simply put a space between each Chinese character of their name, causing those used to alphabetical languages to think of the ''xing'' and ''ming'' as three words instead of two.\n\nThe switch to Pinyin is still quite new for Taiwan and many non-standard spellings continue to be found, including \"Lee\" and \"Soong\". Similarly, many Taiwanese and historic names still employ the older [[Wade\u2013Giles]] system. This [[English language|English]]-influenced system is identified by its use of the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s \"hs\" (for the pinyin ''x'') and \"ts\" (for the pinyin ''z'' and ''c'') and by its use of hyphens to connect the syllables of multi-character words. Correct reading depends on the inclusion of superscript numbers and the use of apostrophes to distinguish between different consonants, but in practice both of these are commonly omitted. In Wade\u2013Giles, {{lang|zh|\u6bdb\u6fa4\u6771}} is written as [[Mao Tse-tung]], as the system hyphenates names between the characters. For example, Wang Xiuying and Sima Qian are written in Wade as \"Wang<sup>2</sup> Hsiu<sup>4</sup>-Ying<sup>1</sup>\" and \"Ssu<sup>1</sup>Ma<sup>3</sup> Ch'ien<sup>1</sup>\".\n\nPinyin and Wade\u2013Giles both represent the pronunciation of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], based on the [[Beijing dialect]]. In [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and the [[Chinese diaspora|diaspora]] communities in southeast Asia and abroad, the Chinese often romanize according to the sounds of their own local Chinese dialect or lingua franca or language mostly spoken in the area or country they settled into, particularly [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], [[Hokkien]], and [[Hakka language|Hakka]]. This occurs amid a plethora of competing romanization systems. In Hong Kong, many Chinese who grew up during British colonial rule adopted English spelling conventions for their names: \"Lee\" for {{lang|zh|\u674e}}, \"Shaw\" for {{lang|zh|\u90b5}}, and so forth. In Macau, Chinese names are similarly sometimes still transliterated based on [[Portuguese orthography]] and [[Jyutping]]. The Chinese from [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and the diaspora communities in Malaysia and Singapore fully divide the characters in their names with spaces as a matter of course.\n\nA final point is that\u2014although characters have remained roughly the same since the Han dynasty and some [[Classical Chinese|classical grammar]] is still part of the core curriculum of Chinese secondary schools\u2014vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation have all changed from [[Old Chinese|Old]] to [[Middle Chinese|Middle]] to [[Written Vernacular Chinese|Modern Chinese]] even within the [[prestige dialect]]s. Thus, although modern Chinese read \"Confucius\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b54|\u592b\u5b50}}}}) as ''K\u01d2ng F\u016bz\u01d0'', the same name would have been ''Khuwng Pjutsi'' in the Tang dynasty and was probably something like an atonal ''Khong\u0294 Pats\u0259\u0294'' during his lifetime.<ref name=\"BaxSag\">Baxter, Wm.

As a result, the upper classes of traditional Chinese culture typically employed a variety of names over the course of their lives, and the [[table of Chinese monarchs|emperors]] and [[ancestor veneration in China|sanctified deceased]] had still others.\n\nCurrent naming practices are more straightforward and consistent, but a few pseudonyms or alternate names remain common.\n\nWhen discussing Chinese writers, Chinese and Japanese scholars do not consistently use particular names, whether they are private names or alternative names.<ref>Chan, Wing-tsit.

Not everyone has one. Most that do received theirs in childhood or adolescence from family or friends. Common Chinese nicknames are those based on a person's physical attributes, speaking style, or behavior. Names involving animals are common, although those animals may be associated with different attributes than they are in English: for example, Chinese cows are strong, not stupid; foxes are devious, not clever; pigs are ugly, lazy, stupid, or content, but not dirty. Similarly, nicknames that might seem especially insulting in English\u2014such as \"Little Fatty\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c0f\u80d6}}}})\u2014are more acceptable in Chinese. One especially common method of creating nicknames is prefixing ''\u0100-'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u963f}}}}) or ''Xi\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5c0f}}}}) to the surname or the second character of the given name. ''\u0100-'' is more common in southern China and abroad, while ''Xi\u01ceo'' is common throughout China. Both ''\u0100-'' and ''Xi\u01ceo'' are distinguished from ''L\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8001}}}}, \"old\" but [[#Forms of address|see below]] for usage). Nicknames are rarely used in formal or semi-formal settings, although a famous exception is [[Chen Shui-bian|A-bian]].\n\n===Western name===\nEnglish is taught throughout China's secondary schools and the English language section is a required component of the ''[[Gaokao]]'', China's college entrance examination. Many Chinese teenagers thus acquire Western names, commonly of English origin, which they may keep and use as nicknames even in Chinese-language contexts. Chinese may adopt English names for a variety of reasons, including foreigners' difficulty with [[Chinese tones]] and better integration of people working in foreign enterprises. The freedom associated with choosing a Chinese given name sometimes leads to choosing English names which seem bizarre to native English speakers. Names taken from nouns are relatively common, such as Chlorophyll, Candy, Devil or Whale.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Established English names chosen by Chinese may also be those rarely used by native English speakers.<ref>\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/hong-kong-loves-weird-english-names/263103/</ref> Creative names made and adopted by [[Hongkongers]] are generated by modifying normal English names either by deleting, inserting or substituting specific letters (e.g. Kith, Sonija, Garbie) or by mimicking the phonetic sounds of the Chinese name (e.g. [[Hacken Lee]] from Lee Hak-kan ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u514b\u52e4}})).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hksarblog.blogspot.com/|title=NOTABLE NAMES (Brilliant Funny Weird Monikers)|website=hksarblog.blogspot.com|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\nIn Hong Kong, because of its one and a half century [[British Hong Kong|British rule]], many Hong Kong people will pick English names as early as attending English classes in kindergarten, or even have the English alias embedded in official documentation. One example is actor Chan Kong-sang, who in English goes by the name [[Jackie Chan]]. The English aliases are widely used at schools and at work. Similar to [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] people of Chinese descent, which shares a similar historical development, it is very common among [[Hongkongers]] to address each other with an English alias. An English alias can be accepted as part of the name in official documentation, but whether to include such is an option to individuals.\n\nIt is also becoming more popular for parents to give their child a middle name in between their given name and family name, similar to many Western traditions.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===School name===\nThe school name ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u5b78\u540d}}|s={{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b66\u540d}}|p=xu\u00e9m\u00edng}}}}) was a separate formal name used by the child while they were at school.\n\nAs [[binomial nomenclature]] is also called ''xu\u00e9m\u00edng'' in Chinese, the school name is also sometimes now referenced as the ''x\u00f9nm\u00edng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8a13\u540d}}}}) to avoid confusion.\n\n===Courtesy name===\n{{Main|Courtesy name}}\n\nUpon maturity, it was common for educated males to acquire a [[courtesy name]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b57}}}}, ''z\u00ec'' or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8868\u5b57}}}}, ''bi\u01ceoz\u00ec'') either from one's parents, a teacher, or self-selection. The name commonly mirrored the meaning of one's given name or displayed his birth order within his family.\n\nThe practice was a consequence of admonitions in the ''[[Book of Rites]]'' that among adults it is disrespectful to be addressed by one's given name by others within the same generation. The true given name was reserved for the use of one's elders, while the courtesy name was employed by peers on formal occasions and in writing. The practice was decried by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and has been largely abandoned.\n\n===Pseudonym===\n{{Main|Art name}}\n\nPseudonyms or aliases ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u53f7}}|p=h\u00e0o}}) or pen names ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u7b46\u540d}}|s={{linktext|\u7b14\u540d}}|p=b\u01d0m\u00edng}}) were self-selected alternative courtesy names, most commonly three or four characters long. They may have originated from too many people having the same courtesy name.\n\nSome\u2014but by no means most\u2014authors do continue to employ stylized pen names. A noted{{dubious|date=May 2012}} example is the exile and dissident poet [[Zhao Zhenkai]], whose pen name is \"Bei Dao\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5317|\u5c9b}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"North Island\").\n\n===Posthumous name===\n{{Main|Posthumous name}}\n\nPosthumous names ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u8ae1\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u8c25\u53f7}}|p=sh\u00ech\u00e0o}}) were honorary names selected after a person's death, used extensively for royalty. The common \"names\" of most Chinese emperors before the [[Tang dynasty]]\u2014with the pointed exception of [[Shi Huangdi]]\u2014are their posthumous ones. In addition to emperors, successful courtiers and politicians such as [[Sun Yat-sen]] also occasionally received posthumous titles.\n\n===Temple name===\n{{Main|Temple name}}\n{{See also|Ancestor veneration in China}}\n\nThe temple name ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u5edf\u865f}}|s={{linktext|\u5e99\u53f7}}|p='mi\u00e0oh\u00e0o}}) of the emperor inscribed on the [[spiritual tablet]]s of the [[imperial ancestral temple]] often differed from his posthumous name. The structure eventually became highly restricted, consisting of a single adjective and either ''z\u01d4'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7956}}}}) or ''z\u014dng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b97}}}}). These common \"names\" of the emperors between the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] are their temple ones.\n\n===Era name===\n{{Main|Chinese era name|Table of Chinese monarchs}}\n\nThe era name ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5e74\u865f}}}}, ''ni\u00e1nh\u00e0o'') arose from the custom of dating years by the reigns of the ruling emperors. Under the [[Han dynasty|Han]], the practice began of changing [[regnal name]]s as means of dispensing with bad luck and attracting better. Almost all era names were literary and employed exactly two characters. By the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, emperors had largely dispensed with the practice and kept a single era name during their reign, such that it is customary to refer to Ming and Qing emperors by their era names.\n\n== Forms of address ==\nWithin families, it is often considered inappropriate or even offensive to use the given names of relatives who are senior to the speaker. Instead, it is more customary to identify each family member by abstract hierarchical connections: among siblings, gender and birth order (big sister, second sister, and so on); for the extended family, the manner of relationship (by birth or marriage; from the maternal or paternal side).\n\nThe hierarchical titles of junior relatives are seldom used except in formal situations, or as indirect reference when speaking to family members who are even younger than the person in question. Children can be called by their given names, or their parents may use their nicknames.\n\nWhen speaking of non-family social acquaintances, people are generally referred to by a title, for example Mother Li ({{zh|t=\u674e\u5abd\u5abd|s=\u674e\u5988\u5988|p=l\u01d0 m\u0101ma}}) or Mrs. Zhu ({{lang|zh|\u6731\u592a\u592a}}, {{zh|p=zh\u016b t\u00e0itai}}). Personal names are used when referring to adult friends or to children, although, unlike in the west, referring to somebody by their full name (including surname) is common even among friends, especially if the person's full name is only two syllables.  It is common to refer to a person as ''l\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|\u8001}}, old) or ''xi\u01ceo'' ({{lang|zh|\u5c0f}}, young) followed by their family name, thus L\u01ceo W\u00e1ng ({{lang|zh|\u8001\u738b}}) or Xi\u01ceo Zh\u0101ng ({{lang|zh|\u5c0f\u5f35, \u5c0f\u5f20}}).  Xi\u01ceo is also frequently used as a diminutive, when it is typically paired with the second or only character in a person's name, rather than the surname.  Note that because old people are well respected in Chinese society, ''l\u01ceo'' (old) does not carry disrespect, offense or any negative implications even if it is used to refer to an older woman.  Despite this, it is advisable for non-Chinese to avoid calling a person xi\u01ceo-something or l\u01ceo-something unless they are so-called by other Chinese people and it is clear that the appellation is acceptable and widely used.  Otherwise, the use of the person's full name, or alternatively, their surname followed by xi\u0101nsheng ({{zh|c=\u5148\u751f}}, mister) or n\u01dash\u00ec ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u5973\u58eb}}, madam) is relatively neutral and unlikely to cause offense.\n\nWithin school settings and when addressing former classmates, it is common to refer to them as older siblings, e.g. elder brother Zhao ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u8d99\u54e5|s=\u8d75\u54e5|p=Zh\u00e0o G\u00e9}}) or e.g. elder sister Zhang ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u5f35\u59d0|s=\u5f20\u59d0|p=Zh\u0101ng J\u01d0e}}) if they were of senior classes, or simply to show respect or closeness. The opposite (e.g. younger brother Zhao) is rarely used. This custom spawns from traditional forms of respectful address, where it was considered rude to directly address your seniors.\n\nWhereas [[title]]s in many cultures are commonly solely determined by gender and, in some cases, marital status, the occupation or even work title of a person can be used as a title as a sign of respect in common address in Chinese culture. Because of the prestigious position of a teacher in traditional culture, a teacher is invariably addressed as such by his or her students (e.g. {{zh|labels=no|c=\u674e\u8001\u5e2b|p=L\u01d0 L\u01ceosh\u012b|l=Teacher Li}}), and commonly by others as a mark of respect. Where applicable, \"Teacher Surname\" is considered more respectful than \"Mr/Mrs/Miss Surname\" in Chinese. A professor is also commonly addressed as \"teacher\", though \"professor\" is also accepted as a respectful title. By extension, a junior or less experienced member of a work place or profession would address a more senior member as \"Teacher\".\n\nSimilarly, engineers are often addressed as such, though often shortened to simply the first character of the word \"engineer\" -- {{zh|c=\u5de5|p=G\u014dng}}. Should the person being addressed be the head of a company (or simply the middle manager of another company to whom you would like to show respect), one might equally address them by the title \"z\u014fng\" ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u603b|t=\u7e3d}}), which means \"general\" or \"overall\", and is the first character of titles such as \"Director General\" or \"General Manager\" (e.g. {{zh|labels=no|t=\u674e\u7e3d|s=\u674e\u603b|p=L\u012d z\u014fng}}), or, if they are slightly lower down on the corporate hierarchy but nonetheless a manager, by affixing J\u012bngl\u012d ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u7ecf\u7406|t=\u7d93\u7406}}, manager).\n\n== Variations ==\n\n===Unusual names===\n{{see also|Naming laws in the People's Republic of China}}\nBecause the small number of Chinese surnames leads to confusion in social environments, and because some Chinese parents have a desire to give individuality, some Chinese have received unusual given names. As of April 2009, about 60 million Chinese people have unusual characters in their names. A 2006 report by the [[Chinese public security bureau]] stated that of about 55,000 Chinese characters used in the People's Republic of China, only 32,232 of those are supported by the ministry's computers. The PRC government has asked individuals with unusual names to change them so they can get new computer-readable public identity cards, and the diversity prevents them from receiving new identity cards if they do not change their names.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nBeginning in at least 2003, the PRC government has been writing a list of standardized characters for everyday usage in life, which would be the pool of characters to select from when a child is given his or her name. Originally the limits were to go in place in 2005. In April 2009, the list had been revised 70 times, and it still has not been put into effect.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nWang Daliang, a [[China Youth University for Political Sciences]] linguistics scholar, said that \"Using obscure names to avoid duplication of names or to be unique is not good. Now a lot of people are perplexed by their names. The computer cannot even recognize them and people cannot read them. This has become an obstacle in communication.\"<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Zhou Youyong, the dean of the [[Southeast University]] law school, argued that the ability to choose the name of one's children is a fundamental right, so the PRC government should be careful when making new naming laws.<ref name=\"Xinhua\"/>\n\nWhile the vast majority of Han Chinese names consist of two or three characters, there are some Han Chinese with longer names, up to 15 characters.<ref name=\"Xinhua\"/> In addition, [[Transcription into Chinese characters|transliteration of ethnic languages into Chinese characters]] often results in long names.\n\n===Taiwan===\n[[Han Chinese|Han]] family names in Taiwan are similar to those in southeast China, as most families trace their origins to places such as [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]].  [[Indigenous Taiwanese]] have also been forced [[Naming customs of Taiwanese aborigines|to adopt Chinese names]] as part of enforced [[Sinicization]]. The popularity distribution of family names in Taiwan as a whole differs somewhat from the distribution of names among all Han Chinese, with the family name [[Chen (surname)|Chen]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u9673}}}}) being particularly more common (about 11% on Taiwan, compared with about 3% on the Mainland). Local variations also exist.\n\nGiven names that consist of one character are much less common on Taiwan than on the mainland.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nA traditional practice, now largely supplanted, was choosing deliberately unpleasant given names to ward off bad omens and evil spirits. For example, a boy facing a serious illness might be renamed Ti-s\u00e1i ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c6c|\u5c4e}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Pig Shit\") to indicate to the evil spirits that he was not worth their trouble. Similarly, a girl from a poor family might have the name B\u00f3ng-ch\u012b ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7f54|\u5e02}}}}, <small>lit.</small> \"No Takers\").\n\nNicknames ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u56dd|\u4ed4|\u540d}}}}, ''g\u00edn-\u00e1-mi\u00e2'', \"child names\") are common and generally adopt the [[nanfangren|Southern Chinese]] practice of affixing the prefix \"A-\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u963f}}}}) to the last syllable of a person's name. Although these names are rarely used in formal contexts, there are a few public figures who are well known by their nicknames, including former president [[Chen Shui-bian|A-bian]] and the singer [[A-mei]].\n\n===Diaspora===\nAmong [[Chinese American]]s, it is common practice to be referred to primarily by the Western name and to use the Chinese given name as an often-omitted [[middle name]].\n\nIn [[Malaysian Chinese|Malaysia]] and [[Chinese Singaporean|Singapore]], it is equally acceptable for Western names to appear before or after the Chinese given name, in Latin characters. Thus, the [[President of Singapore|Singaporean President]] [[Tony Tan Keng Yam|Tony Tan]] might see his name written as \"Tony Tan Keng Yam\" or \"Tan Keng Yam Tony\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Individuals are free to register their [[legal name]]s in either format on their [[National Registration Identity Card|identity card]]s. In general use, the English name first version is typically preferred as it keeps the correct order for both systems; however, for administrative purposes, the [[Government of Singapore|government]] [[Organisations of the Singapore Government|agencies]] tend to place the English name last to organize lists of names and databases more easily, similar to the Western practice of organizing names with the last name first followed by a comma (\"Smith, John\").\n\nThe [[Hong Kong]] printed media tend to adopt the hybrid name style\u2014for example, [[Andy Lau Tak-wah]]\u2014although some people prefer American-style middle names, such as [[Steven N. S. Cheung]], or simply use English names like [[Henry Lee (actor)|Henry Lee]]. On official records such as the Hong Kong [[identity document|Identity Cards]], family names are always printed first in all-caps Latin characters and followed by a comma for all names, including Chinese ones. Thus, the examples above would have identity cards that read \"LAU, Tak-wah Andy\" or \"CHEUNG, Steven Ng-sheong\", with the position of the given names determined at the time of application. Non-Chinese names are printed in similar style: \"DOE, Jane\".\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], one of the country with the most [[Chinese diaspora]] population, the [[Indonesian Chinese]] in Indonesia and in diaspora has mostly adopted [[Chinese Indonesian surname|Indonesian-sounding Chinese names]] due to centuries of regulation and acculturation. Conversely, the usage of these Indonesian-sounding Chinese names are not restricted for surnames, and many are used liberally between other surnames since many Indonesian Chinese didn't keep track their Chinese (sur)names anymore, and even used by non-Chinese people (with some names being borrowing from regional languages and names).\n\n==In English==\n[[File:Sun Yat Sen Signature.png|thumb|The signature of [[Sun Yat-sen]]; in English Chinese people usually keep their names in Chinese order unless they live or travel abroad]]\nChinese people, except for those traveling or living outside China, rarely reverse their names to the western naming order (given name, then family name). Western publications usually preserve the Chinese naming order, with the family name first, followed by the given name.

The shell of an adult milk conch can be distinguished by the high spire, siphonal canal, and flaring lip<ref name=\":12\" />. Milk conch gets its common name by the milky, white interior of the aperture and light cream exterior of its shell. In contrast, other conch species, such as Strombus gigas or Strombus pugilis, are known to have various shades of pink and red tones for the aperture and various patterns or colors on the exterior shell<ref name=\":0\" />. The milk conch eyes have rings that can range in colors of red, orange, yellow, or black<ref name=\":12\" />. The average Lobatus costatus measures around 20 cm in shell length and are considered to be large gastropods. The maximum recorded shell length is 23.1 cm. However, they are a smaller species of conch compared to the more widely studied Lobatus gigas, the queen conch, which can measure up to 31cm<ref name=\":22\" />. \n\n==Habitat==\nLobatus costatus prefers shallow-water back reef habitats, such as algal banks, seagrass beds, and patch reefs, which provide them with shelter, protection, and food<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Cuartas|first=Jaison H.|last2=Alzate|first2=Juan F.|last3=Moreno-Herrera|first3=Claudia X.|last4=Marquez|first4=Edna J.|date=2018-02-15|title=Metagenomic analysis of orange colored protrusions from the muscle of Queen Conch Lobatus gigas (Linnaeus, 1758)|url=https://peerj.com/articles/4307|journal=PeerJ|language=en|volume=6|pages=e4307|doi=10.7717/peerj.4307|issn=2167-8359|pmc=PMC5816965|pmid=29472996}}</ref>.

Wodehouse]] valet character [[Jeeves]] (''[[Thank You, Jeeves]]'', 1936) and the kind butler Andrews opposite [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi (1937 film)|Heidi]]'' (1937). In the 1960s, he became well-known on American television as an announcer/sidekick to talk show host [[Merv Griffin]].  He lent his name to the [[Arthur Treacher's]] [[Fish and Chips]] chain of restaurants.\n\n==Personal life==\nTreacher was the son of Arthur Veary Treacher (1862\u20131924), a [[Sussex]] [[solicitor]]; his mother was Alice Mary Longhurst (1865\u20131946).  He was educated at a [[boarding school]] in [[Uppingham School|Uppingham]] in [[Rutland]]. In 1936, he married Virginia Taylor (1898\u20131984).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/arthur-treacher/ | title=Arthur Treacher |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref>\n\n==Acting career==\nTreacher was a veteran of World War I, serving as an officer of the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]]; his father had served with the Sussex Volunteer Artillery before Treacher's birth. After the war, he established an acting career in England, and in March 1926 went to New York as part of a musical-comedy revue named ''Great Temptations''. He was featured in the 1930 [[Billy Rose]] musical revue ''[[Sweet and Low (musical)|Sweet and Low]]''.\n\nHe began his movie career during the 1930s, which included roles in four [[Shirley Temple]] movies: ''[[Curly Top (film)|Curly Top]]'' (1935), uncredited ''[[Stowaway (1936 film)|Stowaway]]'' (1936), ''[[Heidi (1937 film)|Heidi]]'' (1937) and ''[[The Little Princess (1939 film)|The Little Princess]]'' (1939). Scenes intentionally had the 6' 4\" Treacher standing or dancing side-by-side with the tiny child actress; for example, they sing and dance together in ''[[The Little Princess (1939 film)|The Little Princess]]'' an old song \"Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road\".<ref>{{YouTube|9VRhMjUijtE|Arthur Treacher and Shirley Temple Wotcher! Knocked Em' in the Old Kent Road}}</ref>\n\nTreacher filled the role of the ideal [[butler]], and he portrayed [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s valet character [[Jeeves]] in the movies ''[[Thank You, Jeeves!]]'' (1936) and ''Step Lively, Jeeves'' (1937). (Wodehouse, however, was unhappy with the way his work had been adapted, and refused to authorize any further Jeeves movies.<ref name=\"Taves\">{{cite book|\nlast=Taves\n|first=Brian\n|title=P. G.

He was also caricatured in the 1941 cartoon ''[[Hollywood Steps Out]]''.\nTreacher also did radio programs in the 1940s and early 1950s, most notably as a waiter on ''[[Duffy's Tavern]]''.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Later years==\nDuring 1961 and 1962, he and [[William Gaxton]] appeared in [[Guy Lombardo]]'s production of the musical revue ''[[Paradise Island (musical)|Paradise Island]]'', which played at the [[Jones Beach Marine Theater]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA23|journal=Life|date=16 June 1961|page=23|title=Theater: Straw Hat Shows \u2013 Marine Theater, Jones Beach, LI}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://jblc.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1387&sid=20dca6eaa8a625c9579739b96296c6c9#p1387|author= Jones Beach Lifeguard Corps|journal=JBLC.net|title=Forum pages}}</ref> In 1962, he replaced [[Robert Coote]] as King Pellinore (with over-the-title name billing) in the original Broadway production of [[Lerner and Loewe]]'s musical play ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', and he remained with the show through the Chicago engagement and post-Broadway tour that ended during August 1964.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s on, Treacher became a familiar figure on American television as a guest on talk shows and panel games, including ''[[The Tonight Show]]'',  ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', and ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''.  In 1964, Treacher was cast in the role of Constable Jones in the hugely successful [[Walt Disney]] movie ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''.  That same year, he played the role of stuffy English butler Arthur Pinckney in two episodes of ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''. Pinckney mistakenly believed the hillbillies were the domestic servants of the family by whom he was hired, while the hillbillies believed Pinckney was a boarder at their [[Beverly Hills]] mansion.\n[[File:Arthur Treacher Merv Griffin Merv Griffin late night show 1969.JPG|thumb|left|Treacher and [[Merv Griffin]] on Griffin's CBS talk show, 1969.]]\n\nHe became even better known to American television audiences when talk-show host [[Merv Griffin]] made him announcer and occasional bantering partner on  ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' from 1965\u201370 (\"...and now, here's the dear boy himself, Merrr-vyn!\").  When in 1969 Griffin switched from  [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] to the [[CBS]] network, network executives insisted that Treacher was too old for the show, but Griffin fought to keep Treacher and eventually won. However, when Griffin relocated his show to Los Angeles the next year, Treacher stayed behind, telling Griffin \"at my age, I don't want to move, especially to someplace that shakes!\"\n\nDuring this period of latter-day popularity, Treacher capitalised on his name recognition through the use of his name and image for such franchised business concerns as the Call Arthur Treacher Service System (a household help agency) and [[Arthur Treacher's|Arthur Treacher's Fish and Chips]] restaurants. The restaurants became very popular during the 1970s and increased to nearly 900 outlets, although it is unclear whether or not Treacher had any direct  ownership involvement with the company.

Wodehouse]] valet character [[Jeeves]] (''[[Thank You, Jeeves]]'', 1936) and the kind butler Andrews opposite [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi (1937 film)|Heidi]]'' (1937). In the 1960s, he became well-known on American television as an announcer/sidekick to talk show host [[Merv Griffin]].  He lent his name to the [[Arthur Treacher's]] [[Fish and Chips]] chain of restaurants.\n\n==Personal life==\nTreacher was the son of Arthur Veary Treacher (1862\u20131924), a [[Sussex]] [[solicitor]]; his mother was Alice Mary Longhurst (1865\u20131946).  He was educated at a [[boarding school]] in [[Uppingham School|Uppingham]] in [[Rutland]]. In 1936, he married Virginia Taylor (1898\u20131984).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/arthur-treacher/ | title=Arthur Treacher |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref>\n\n==Acting career==\nTreacher was a veteran of World War I, serving as an officer of the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]]; his father had served with the Sussex Volunteer Artillery before Treacher's birth. After the war, he established an acting career in England, and in March 1926 went to New York as part of a musical-comedy revue named ''Great Temptations''. He was featured in the 1930 [[Billy Rose]] musical revue ''[[Sweet and Low (musical)|Sweet and Low]]''.\n\nHe began his movie career during the 1930s, which included roles in four [[Shirley Temple]] movies: ''[[Curly Top (film)|Curly Top]]'' (1935), uncredited ''[[Stowaway (1936 film)|Stowaway]]'' (1936), ''[[Heidi (1937 film)|Heidi]]'' (1937) and ''[[The Little Princess (1939 film)|The Little Princess]]'' (1939). Scenes intentionally had the 6' 4\" Treacher standing or dancing side-by-side with the tiny child actress; for example, they sing and dance together in ''[[The Little Princess (1939 film)|The Little Princess]]'' an old song \"Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road\".<ref>{{YouTube|9VRhMjUijtE|Arthur Treacher and Shirley Temple Wotcher! Knocked Em' in the Old Kent Road}}</ref>\n\nTreacher filled the role of the ideal [[butler]], and he portrayed [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s valet character [[Jeeves]] in the movies ''[[Thank You, Jeeves!]]'' (1936) and ''Step Lively, Jeeves'' (1937). (Wodehouse, however, was unhappy with the way his work had been adapted, and refused to authorize any further Jeeves movies.<ref name=\"Taves\">{{cite book|\nlast=Taves\n|first=Brian\n|title=P. G.

He was also caricatured in the 1941 cartoon ''[[Hollywood Steps Out]]''.\nTreacher also did radio programs in the 1940s and early 1950s, most notably as a waiter on ''[[Duffy's Tavern]]''.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Later years==\nDuring 1961 and 1962, he and [[William Gaxton]] appeared in [[Guy Lombardo]]'s production of the musical revue ''[[Paradise Island (musical)|Paradise Island]]'', which played at the [[Jones Beach Marine Theater]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA23|journal=Life|date=16 June 1961|page=23|title=Theater: Straw Hat Shows \u2013 Marine Theater, Jones Beach, LI}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://jblc.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1387&sid=20dca6eaa8a625c9579739b96296c6c9#p1387|author= Jones Beach Lifeguard Corps|journal=JBLC.net|title=Forum pages}}</ref> In 1962, he replaced [[Robert Coote]] as King Pellinore (with over-the-title name billing) in the original Broadway production of [[Lerner and Loewe]]'s musical play ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', and he remained with the show through the Chicago engagement and post-Broadway tour that ended during August 1964.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s on, Treacher became a familiar figure on American television as a guest on talk shows and panel games, including ''[[The Tonight Show]]'',  ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', and ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]''.  In 1964, Treacher was cast in the role of Constable Jones in the hugely successful [[Walt Disney]] movie ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''.  That same year, he played the role of stuffy English butler Arthur Pinckney in two episodes of ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''. Pinckney mistakenly believed the hillbillies were the domestic servants of the family by whom he was hired, while the hillbillies believed Pinckney was a boarder at their [[Beverly Hills]] mansion.\n[[File:Arthur Treacher Merv Griffin Merv Griffin late night show 1969.JPG|thumb|left|Treacher and [[Merv Griffin]] on Griffin's CBS talk show, 1969.]]\n\nHe became even better known to American television audiences when talk-show host [[Merv Griffin]] made him announcer and occasional bantering partner on  ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' from 1965\u201370 (\"...and now, here's the dear boy himself, Merrr-vyn!\").  When in 1969 Griffin switched from  [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] to the [[CBS]] network, network executives insisted that Treacher was too old for the show, but Griffin fought to keep Treacher and eventually won. However, when Griffin relocated his show to Los Angeles the next year, Treacher stayed behind, telling Griffin \"at my age, I don't want to move, especially to someplace that shakes!\"\n\nDuring this period of latter-day popularity, Treacher capitalised on his name recognition through the use of his name and image for such franchised business concerns as the Call Arthur Treacher Service System (a household help agency) and [[Arthur Treacher's|Arthur Treacher's Fish and Chips]] restaurants. The restaurants became very popular during the 1970s and increased to nearly 900 outlets, although it is unclear whether or not Treacher had any direct  ownership involvement with the company. By 2016, there were seven restaurants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurtreachersfranchising.com/locations.php|title=Arthur Treacher's|accessdate=26 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nTreacher died at the age of 81 due to cardiovascular disease.\n\n==Filmography==\n{{div col}}\n* ''[[The Battle of Paris]]'' (1929){{snd}}Harry\n* ''[[Fashions of 1934]]'' (1934){{snd}}The Duchess' Butler (uncredited)\n* ''[[Gambling Lady]]'' (1934){{snd}}Pryor (uncredited)\n* ''[[Riptide (film)|Riptide]]'' (1934){{snd}}Reporter (uncredited)\n* ''[[Viva Villa!]]'' (1934){{snd}}English Reporter (scenes deleted)\n* ''[[Hollywood Party (1934 film)|Hollywood Party]]'' (1934){{snd}}Durante's Butler (uncredited)\n* ''[[The Key (1934 film)|The Key]]'' (1934){{snd}}Lt.
