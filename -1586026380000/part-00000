This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches. One of the branches was Dar al-'Elm and various sciences (Such as reading and writing to mathematics and geography and foreign language training) which were taught, and the condition of admission and degree was a test and test success that was held by the Ministry of Education.

This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.\n\nThe features of this newspaper could be mentioned in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.\n\n=== From copies to caricaturing\t===\nThe newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, was originally written in four pages with the Traditional version writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters.

For example, at the same time, the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. Therefore, it came to a result that nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. \n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting with old traditions especially among women was one of the actions of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to convey the voice of suppression and reactionary ideas.
