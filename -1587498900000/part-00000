The film is based on the [[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|1983 cartoon series]] created by [[DIC Entertainment|DiC Entertainment]] and is a sequel to the 1999 film, ''[[Inspector Gadget (film)|Inspector Gadget]]''.\n\nUnlike the first film, ''Inspector Gadget 2'' draws more influence from the original cartoon series. The characters' personalities were altered to be more in line with their cartoon counterparts and [[Doctor Claw|Dr. Claw's]] face is never shown. [[Inspector Gadget|Gadget]] and Claw are never referred to as \"John Brown\" and \"Sanford Scolex\", their respective civilian names from the first film (though Claw's communicator is still labeled as \"Scolex Industries\"). \n\nWith the exception of [[D. L. Hughley]], who returned as the voice of the Gadgetmobile, none of the actors from the 1999 film reprised their roles.\n\n==Plot==\nInspector Gadget ([[French Stewart]]) and his Gadgetmobile (voiced by [[D.L. Hughley]]) are having problems in their line of work, mostly because of Gadget's overzealous nature and his paranoia about minor mistakes committed by citizens as being crimes. Gadget is put on probation by an angry Chief Quimby ([[Mark Mitchell (actor)|Mark Mitchell]]) after criminally charging Quimby's mother for barely going slightly above the speed limit on a mostly-deserted highway. At this time, Dr. Claw ([[Tony Martin (Australian actor)|Tony Martin]]) escapes from prison, seeking to get revenge against Gadget for putting him in prison and to restart his multi-million-dollar empire. Mayor Wilson ([[Sigrid Thornton]]) takes this opportunity to create G2 ([[Elaine Hendrix]]), a female Gadget-type robot that can function normally compared to the original Gadget, who not only was born a human but has been malfunctioning as of late. Gadget begins to fall in love with G2, though G2 doesn't reciprocate as she prefers to work alone, viewing him as a nuisance.\n\nDr. Claw begins a new plan to steal gold from the United States Treasury. Gadget makes repeated attempts to stop Claw, but is continually foiled by his own bumbling and gadgetry glitches. Gadget's bumbling allows Dr. Claw's men to steal components for Claw's latest scheme and get away with it. Chief Quimby becomes increasingly frustrated and eventually fires Gadget, despite  Gadget having enough evidence from scientists to prove that it wasn't his fault. When Penny ([[Caitlin Wachs]]) realizes that her uncle was fired and asks if there's anything she can do to help, Gadget tells her that she is still too young and to not get involved. Meanwhile, Dr. Claw's henchmen are now free to steal the rest of the components for Claw's scheme. \n\nPenny decides to examine the evidence on her own and eventually finds Claw's hideout at an abandoned bowling factory in the outskirts of the city. She infiltrates the hideout, but Claw and his men capture her. At the gala,{{Clarify|date=June 2019}} Gadget gets a job as a limo driver who opens doors for the guests. Inside the gala, Claw activates a bowling pin containing laughing gas to keep the people busy as he steals a 50,000-karat ruby, however G2 is immune to the gas.  In order to stop the robot, Claw uses a magnet to trap G2. Afterwards, Claw and his minions escape, Gadget failing to recognize him. After G2's failure, Quimby is ordered by Mayor Wilson to deactivate the robot and end the Gadget program.\n\nFeeling like G2 was scapegoated, and still in love with her, Inspector Gadget goes to the police department to reactivate G2.  Brain (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett|Jeff Glenn Bennett]]), having escaped Claw's men, tells them through a dog translation device, that Claw has kidnapped Penny and has used the three stolen supplies (ionic fuel cells, a protoid laser, and a ruby) to build a super-weapon. Upon realizing that Claw has been based in the bowling factory, Gadget finally connects the evidence Penny previously presented to him (the bowling shoe) and regrets not listening to her.  Gadget asks G2 to help him save Penny and foil Claw's scheme and G2 agrees.\n\nThe next day, Claw activates his machine, which was hidden in a truck. The weapon is a laser that freezes time in Riverton, allowing Claw and his minions to easily rob the Federal Reserve. Claw has plans to not only use the laser against Riverton, but also the entire world, so he can rob Fort Knox, and a variety of other valuable places. Both Gadgets manage to avoid the weapon's blast, and find Claw and his minions at the Federal Reserve.\n\nAt the treasury, Claw orders his minions to attack Gadget and G2 so he can get away. Gadget and G2 decide to switch chips in order to make Gadget work perfectly, leaving G2 to deal with the glitches but to still successfully capture Claw's hired goons. Gadget chases after Claw, who is escaping in an ice cream truck, but Claw drops Penny off the truck with explosives attached to her so that Gadget has to go after her instead of stopping Claw. After saving Penny's life from a resulting explosion, Gadget and Penny reunite with G2 and the Gadgetmobile and decide to finish this once and for all. At a bridge, Gadget stops Claw's truck with a puddle of bubble gum. Claw's minions try to escape, but get stuck in the smear of bubble gum and are arrested. When Gadget orders Claw to put his hand (and claw) up, Claw gets away in a rocket-like escape pod, proclaiming: \"You may have won this round, but I'll get you next time, Gadget!\"\n\nAfter Claw escapes, Gadget, Penny and G2 go to Claw's laser to reverse the damage done.  Unfortunately it is a password-locked laser and they must guess his password.  Penny's quick thinking eventually unlocks the laser and they reverse the effects of the laser, thus unfreezing the town.\n\nThe movie ends with both Gadgets being awarded their jobs back, the Gadget program being reinstated, as well as both Gadgets being honored at a ceremony for their heroic actions, by Mayor Wilson.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[French Stewart]] as [[Inspector Gadget]]\n* [[Elaine Hendrix]] as G2\n* [[Tony Martin (Australian actor)|Tony Martin]] as [[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Dr. Claw]]\n* [[Caitlin Wachs]] as Penny\n* [[Jeff Bennett|Jeff Glenn Bennett]] as Brain the Dog (voice)\n* [[D.

[[Bihar]] in [[India]]. The district headquarters are located at [[Motihari]].\n\n==About District==\nEast Champaran District is functioning from 2 November 1972. The headquarter of district is at Motihari. It is situated at 26o 16' to 27o 1' North latitude and 84o 30' to 85o 16' East longitudes. [[Nepal]] makes its northern boundary, Sitamadhi and Sheohar eastern while Muzaffarpur South and with part of Gopalganj bounds it in western side. The name Champaran owes its origin to Champa-aranya or Champkatanys. Champa or Champaka means Magnolia and aranya means forest. Hence, Champaranya means Forest of Magnolia (CHAMPA) trees. The District comprises an area of 3968.0 sq km with 1344 villages having population of 50,82,868 as per 2011 census. The Administrative set up of the District is decentralized into 6 sub-division, 27 blocks, 27 Circles, 3 Nagar Parishads (Motihari, Raxaul and Dhaka), 6 Nagar Panchayats and 405 Panchayats. The Buddhist Stupta, Kesaria, Ashokan Pillar, Lauriya, Areraj, Gandhi Memorial, Someshwar Shiv Mandir, Areraj, Orwell's birthplace, Raxaul-Gate way to Nepal.\n\nThe district occupies an area of 3969&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and has a population of 3,933,636 ({{As of|2001|lc=on}}). East Champaran is a part of [[Tirhut Division]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tirhut-muzaffarpur.bih.nic.in|title=Tirhut Division|website=tirhut-muzaffarpur.bih.nic.in|accessdate=11 April 2018}}</ref> ([[Tirhut]]).

Though he was  willing to accept Crown office, he spent much of his career in opposition to  the Government. He was one of the leaders of the protest against the  policies of  the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir [[Henry Sidney]],  in the late 1570s, and as a member of the [[Irish House of Commons]] in the 1580s  he successfully opposed  Sidney's successor, Sir [[John Perrot]]. In the early 1600s he was one of the leaders of the protest against strict enforcement of the [[Penal Laws]]. His professional reputation was gravely  damaged in his later years when he was convicted and fined  for having altered a deed concerning the proper disposition of the  11th  Earl of Kildare's estate. He was the grandfather of the playwright Henry Burnell.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[Castleknock]], County [[Dublin]], son of John Burnell.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921'' John Murray London 1926 p.223</ref> The Burnells were a long-established Dublin  family, which had settled at [[Balgriffin]]; they  were descended from Robert Burnell, who was a Baron of the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)]] between about 1388 and 1413.<ref>Ball p.223</ref> An earlier [[John Burnell]] was briefly [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]] in the 1490s. The family were staunchly   Roman Catholic and their loyalty to the Crown was sometimes questioned as a result. Henry's father had managed to retain his  estates after his cousin, another  John  Burnell, had been executed for his part in the rebellion of [[Silken Thomas]] in the 1530s. The  elder Henry  was still alive, although described as \"very old\", in 1577. Henry was at [[Lincoln's Inn]]  in 1561-2 and was one of a group of  Irish students who compiled a book detailing the maladministration of [[the Pale]] (those  four counties  which were under secure Crown control). He returned to Ireland to practice law about 1564.\n\nIn 1573 he was appointed Recorder of Dublin but resigned  little over a year later. His motives are unclear but since he emerged soon after as legal adviser to [[Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare|the Earl of Kildare]] it is likely that he found private practice more lucrative.<ref name=\"Ball\">Ball, p.223</ref> Even Sir Henry Sidney, a stern critic of Burnell, admitted that there was no doubt of  his  great success at the Bar, which  made him a rich man.<ref>[[Richard Bagwell]]  ''Ireland Under the Tudors''  London Longman Greens  3 Volumes 1885-90  Vol. II p.329</ref>\n\n==Cess controversy==\nThe ''cess'', a tax levied on the landowners   of  [[the Pale]],  supposedly for military purposes, had always been unpopular, and Burnell had denounced it as early as 1562. In 1576 the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], Henry Sidney, announced ambitious plans to reform and extend it. The landowners of the Pale protested that the cost would be ruinous.<ref>Bagwell pp.328-9</ref> Burnell was  one of a deputation of three  eminent lawyers chosen to petition [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] directly against the cess, the others being [[Richard Netterville]] and [[Barnaby Skurloke or Skurlog|Barnaby Skurlock]]. The mission went badly; Elizabeth took grave  offence at the challenge to her [[royal prerogative]] and at Sidney's urging  she imprisoned the three lawyers in the [[Fleet Prison]]. Given his family's previous  association with [[Silken Thomas]] Burnell was vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty.  Sidney, while grudgingly calling him the most honest of the three lawyers (if only he would stay out of politics), accused him of being a \"perverse Papist\" with  \"a great thirst to rid his country of the English.\"<ref name=\"Bagwell p.329\">Bagwell p.329</ref>  As opposition to Sidney's plans mounted and he began thinking of  asking for his   recall to England, the tension eased and the three lawyers  were freed in return for  making an abject apology.<ref>Nolan, Pierce Laurence \"Richard Netterville\" ''Dictionary of National Biography 1885\u20131900 Vol.40'' pp.237\u20138</ref>\n\n==Parliament of 1585==\nBurnell and Richard Netterville returned to their opposition role in the Irish Parliament of 1585,  to which Burnell had been returned as  a [[knight of the shire]] for [[Dublin County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|County Dublin]]. The new Lord Deputy Sir John Perrot, like Sidney before him,  had an ambitious reform program, but the opposition thwarted him at every opportunity, even insisting on examining his accounts, for which Perrot wished them \"foul scorn\". He imprisoned some of the opposition members,  but was unable to get his  legislative program passed.<ref>Crawford, Jon.G  ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland -the Court of Castle Chamber 1571\u20131641'' Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p246</ref>\n\nSomewhat surprisingly Burnell was once more appointed to the Bench in 1590 as third justice of the King's Bench.<ref name=\"Ball\" /> However he served only for a single term, which may suggest  that it was only a temporary office, or that doubts had once more been raised about his loyalty.\n\n==Penal laws==\nBurnell was a staunch [[Roman Catholic]] and strongly objected to the [[Anglican]] settlement; in 1605-6 he was one of the strongest supporters of [[Patrick Barnewall (died 1622)|Patrick Barnewall]] in his protest against the fines imposed for failure to attend [[Anglican]] service and the use of the [[Court of Castle Chamber]] to impose religious conformity. Yet again he was arrested but, probably because of his age,  he was not imprisoned.<ref>Kenny, Colum ''The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland'' Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 p.66</ref>\n\n==''Digby v Earl of Kildare''==\nIn his last years his  professional reputation  suffered  greatly from the reopening of the Kildare inheritance dispute which  had begun 20 years earlier. [[Lettice Digby, 1st Baroness Offaly]] was the granddaughter and heir general of Burnell's old client the 11th Earl of Kildare and his wife [[Mabel Browne]]. Lettice and her husband deeply resented the fact that the great bulk of the Kildare inheritance had passed first to her uncle and then to her cousin [[Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Kildare]]. By 1602 she had learned that a crucial [[deed]] supposedly executed by her grandfather, who died in 1585, might have been forged or tampered with by his widow. She and her husband [[Robert Digby (courtier)|Sir Robert Digby]] then sued both the  present Earl and the aged Dowager Countess. The case went on for over a decade and involved numerous hearings in several different courts.<ref>Crawford, p.493</ref>\n\nIn 1608 the [[Court of Castle Chamber]], the  Irish equivalent of [[Star Chamber]],  began an inquiry into the [[forgery]] allegation, which transformed a private lawsuit into a matter concerning the Crown.<ref>Something the Court came to regret, since the case was so complex that for two law terms it was unable to deal with any other business: Crawford pp.293-5</ref> The old Countess admitted that she had consulted Burnell in 1585 about the deed, fearing that it did not  adequately protect her [[jointure]], and that Burnell had advised that it did not give adequate protection but that he would make the necessary alterations.<ref>Crawford pp.494\u20135</ref> Burnell himself admitted to having advised on making some alterations \"but without offence\" (presumably he meant without criminal intent). The Chamber acquitted the Countess of any crime, but found Burnell guilty of [[forgery]], a \"grave offence deserving severe punishment\". He was subjected to a heavy fine and to be imprisoned at the Crown's pleasure, although it does not seem the latter penalty was carried out.<ref>Crawford p.496</ref>\n\nJon Crawford  in his detailed analysis  of the trial cautions against placing too much reliance on evidence from witnesses who were describing the events of more than 20 years past.<ref>Crawford p.151</ref> Nonetheless Burnell did admit to having advised that the deed could be altered.  Such behaviour from an eminent lawyer, whom even his critics admitted  an honest man, seems extraordinary, but the Kildares were his most important clients and he may have wished to retain the Countess' business by obliging her in the matter of the deed.\n\n==Family==\nBurnell married into the O'Reilly family of [[Cavan]]; his wife died in 1605. Of their children only one  son Christopher reached adulthood. Christopher was the father of [[Henry Burnell (author)|Henry Burnell the younger]], who was a leader of the [[Irish Confederacy]] and a well-known author, best remembered for his play ''Landgartha''.<ref name=\"Ball_a\">Ball p.224</ref>\n\n==Death and reputation==\nBurnell died at Castleknock in 1614. He was remembered as one of the best orators and most eminent lawyers of his time. He was somewhat vain about  his  legal  ability, and  was said to boast of his power to  invariably persuade  judges to find in his favour.<ref name=\"Ball_a\" /> Despite the Kildare scandal, he was generally considered  to be an honest man, as even Sir Henry Sidney,  one of his sternest  critics, admitted.<ref name=\"Bagwell p.329\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burnell, Henry}}\n[[Category:1540s births]]\n[[Category:1614 deaths]]\n[[Category:Politicians from County Dublin]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland]]\n[[Category:Irish MPs 1585\u20131586]]\n[[Category:Recorders of Dublin]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Dublin constituencies]]\n", "text_old": "{{for| his grandson, the Irish politician, playwright and landowner|Henry Burnell (author)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n\n'''Henry Burnell''' (c. 1540\u20131614) was an Irish judge and politician; he served briefly as  [[Recorder of Dublin]] and  as a justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)|Court of King's Bench]].

Sidney, while grudgingly calling him the most honest of the three lawyers (if only he would stay out of politics), accused him of being a \"perverse Papist\" with  \"a great thirst to rid his country of the English.\"<ref name=\"Bagwell p.329\">Bagwell p.329</ref>  As opposition to Sidney's plans mounted and he began thinking of  asking for his   recall to England, the tension eased and the three lawyers  were freed in return for  making an abject apology.<ref>Nolan, Pierce Laurence \"Richard Netterville\" ''Dictionary of National Biography 1885\u20131900 Vol.40'' pp.237\u20138</ref>\n\n==Parliament of 1585==\nBurnell and Richard Netterville returned to their opposition role in the Irish Parliament of 1585,  to which Burnell had been returned as  a [[knight of the shire]] for [[Dublin County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|County Dublin]]. The new Lord Deputy Sir John Perrot, like Sidney before him,  had an ambitious reform program, but the opposition thwarted him at every opportunity, even insisting on examining his accounts, for which Perrot wished them \"foul scorn\". He imprisoned some of the opposition members,  but was unable to get his  legislative program passed.<ref>Crawford, Jon.G  ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland -the Court of Castle Chamber 1571\u20131641'' Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p246</ref>\n\nSomewhat surprisingly Burnell was once more appointed to the Bench in 1590 as third justice of the King's Bench.<ref name=\"Ball\" /> However he served only for a single term, which may suggest  that it was only a temporary office, or that doubts had once more been raised about his loyalty.\n\n==Penal laws==\nBurnell was a staunch [[Roman Catholic]] and strongly objected to the [[Anglican]] settlement; in 1605-6 he was one of the strongest supporters of [[Patrick Barnewall (died 1622)|Patrick Barnewall]] in his protest against the fines imposed for failure to attend [[Anglican]] service and the use of the [[Court of Castle Chamber]] to impose religious conformity. Yet again he was arrested but, probably because of his age,  he was not imprisoned.<ref>Kenny, Colum ''The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland'' Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 p.66</ref>\n\n==''Digby v Earl of Kildare''==\nIn his last years his  professional reputation  suffered  greatly from the reopening of the Kildare inheritance dispute which  had begun 20 years earlier. [[Lettice Digby, 1st Baroness Offaly]] was the granddaughter and heir general of Burnell's old client the 11th Earl of Kildare and his wife [[Mabel Browne]]. Lettice and her husband deeply resented the fact that the great bulk of the Kildare inheritance had passed first to her uncle and then to her cousin [[Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Kildare]]. By 1602 she had learned that a crucial [[deed]] supposedly executed by her grandfather, who died in 1585, might have been forged or tampered with by his widow. She and her husband [[Robert Digby (courtier)|Sir Robert Digby]] then sued both the  present Earl and the aged Dowager Countess. The case went on for over a decade and involved numerous hearings in several different courts.<ref>Crawford, p.493</ref>\n\nIn 1608 the [[Court of Castle Chamber]], the  Irish equivalent of [[Star Chamber]],  began an inquiry into the [[forgery]] allegation, which transformed a private lawsuit into a matter concerning the Crown.<ref>Something the Court came to regret, since the case was so complex that for two law terms it was unable to deal with any other business: Crawford pp.293-5</ref> The old Countess admitted that she had consulted Burnell in 1585 about the deed, fearing that it did not  adequately protect her [[jointure]], and that Burnell had advised that it did not give adequate protection but that he would make the necessary alterations.<ref>Crawford pp.494\u20135</ref> Burnell himself admitted to having advised on making some alterations \"but without offence\" (presumably he meant without criminal intent). The Chamber acquitted the Countess of any crime, but found Burnell guilty of [[forgery]], a \"grave offence deserving severe punishment\". He was subjected to a heavy fine and to be imprisoned at the Crown's pleasure, although it does not seem the latter penalty was carried out.<ref>Crawford p.496</ref>\n\nJon Crawford  in his detailed analysis  of the trial cautions against placing too much reliance on evidence from witnesses who were describing the events of more than 20 years past.<ref>Crawford p.151</ref> Nonetheless Burnell did admit to having advised that the deed could be altered.  Such behaviour from an eminent lawyer, whom even his critics admitted  an honest man, seems extraordinary, but the Kildares were his most important clients and he may have wished to retain the Countess' business by obliging her in the matter of the deed.\n\n==Family==\nBurnell married into the O'Reilly family of [[Cavan]]; his wife died in 1605. Of their children only one  son Christopher reached adulthood. Christopher was the father of [[Henry Burnell (author)|Henry Burnell the younger]], who was a leader of the [[Irish Confederacy]] and a well-known author, best remembered for his play ''Landgartha''.<ref name=\"Ball_a\">Ball p.224</ref>\n\n==Death and reputation==\nBurnell died at Castleknock in 1614. He was remembered as one of the best orators and most eminent lawyers of his time. He was somewhat vain about  his  legal  ability, and  was said to boast of his power to  invariably persuade  judges to find in his favour.<ref name=\"Ball_a\" /> Despite the Kildare scandal, he was generally considered  to be an honest man, as even Sir Henry Sidney,  one of his sternest  critics, admitted.<ref name=\"Bagwell p.329\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burnell, Henry}}\n[[Category:1540s births]]\n[[Category:1614 deaths]]\n[[Category:Politicians from County Dublin]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland]]\n[[Category:Irish MPs 1585\u20131586]]\n[[Category:Recorders of Dublin]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Dublin constituencies]]\n", "name_user": "Chrisdoyleorwell", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEarly life", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Burnell"}

The first single was \"[[Steady, As She Goes|Steady, As She Goes/Store Bought Bones]]\" and was released as a limited-edition 7-inch, 45 rpm [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]] in Europe on January 30, 2006,<ref name=\"NMEfirstsingle\">[https://www.nme.com/news/white-stripes/22043 The Raconteurs confirm first single] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001023531/http://www.nme.com/news/white-stripes/22043 |date=October 1, 2007 }}, ''[[NME]]'', 2006-01-24</ref> and in North America on March 7, 2006. A CD version of \"Steady, As She Goes\" was released on April 24, 2006, with the B-side \"Bane Rendition\".\n\nThe Raconteurs first performed live at the Academy in [[Liverpool]], UK, on March 20, 2006, launching a short British tour. Their first American date was the following month, on April 20, at [[New York City]]'s [[Irving Plaza]]. Nearly nonstop touring followed, bringing the band to audiences around North America and Europe. The high profile of Jack White meant that even though the band was new, they were able to sell out mid-size venues\u2014a rarity for a band's first tour.\n\n''Broken Boy Soldiers'' was released on May 15, 2006, in the UK on [[Third Man Records|Third Man Recordings]]/[[XL Recordings]] and May 16 in the U.S. on Third Man Recordings/[[V2 Records]]. It entered the UK charts at No.&nbsp;2 and the U.S. charts at No.&nbsp;7.\n\nIn November 2006, the Raconteurs played eight dates as the opening act for [[Bob Dylan]] on the north-eastern leg of his U.S. tour. On November 3, 2006, the Raconteurs performed the song \"Store Bought Bones\" and the title track, \"Broken Boy Soldier\" on ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]''. According to ''[[Planet Sound]]'' (who had reporters in attendance), during \"Store Bought Bones\", White's guitar malfunctioned and they had to re-play the song. This eventually happened four times, with the band breaking up in laughter by the fourth take. The TV airing used edited pieces from all four performances and cut out any laughter. The band's cover of \"[[Teenage Kicks]]\" by [[The Undertones]] appeared on a 40-year anniversary of the [[BBC]] live compilation. They played it live on a [[John Peel]] tribute.\n\nThe band has performed a number of covers during live shows. For instance, the set list usually includes renditions of \"[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]\" (a song written by [[Sonny Bono]] and popularized by both [[Cher]] and [[Nancy Sinatra]]) and \"Headin' for the Texas Border\" by The [[Flamin' Groovies]]. Other songs the band has covered include [[Gnarls Barkley]]'s \"[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]\", [[Bo Diddley]]'s \"[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love?]]\", [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"[[It Ain't Easy (Ron Davies song)|It Ain\u00b4t Easy]]\", [[Love (band)|Love]]'s \"A House Is Not a Motel\", and [[Charley Jordan]]'s \"Keep It Clean\". The band has also covered the song \"Floating\" by the Irish band [[Jape (band)|Jape]], and \"Send Me a Postcard\", by Dutch band [[Shocking Blue]]. They have also performed an old Blues song written by Big Joe Williams in 1935 (popularized by Van Morrison's \"Them\" in 1964), \"Baby, Please Don't Go.\"\n\nIn December 2006, the band's debut album, ''Broken Boy Soldiers'', was awarded the title Album of the Year by Britain's [[Mojo (magazine)|''Mojo'' magazine]]. In 2007, the album was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album]].

The band consists of [[Jack White]] (vocals, guitar), [[Brendan Benson]] (vocals, guitar), [[Jack Lawrence (musician)|Jack Lawrence]] (bass guitar), and [[Patrick Keeler]] (drums). Lawrence and Keeler were originally members of [[the Greenhornes]], while White and Lawrence went on to become members of [[the Dead Weather]].\n\n==History==\nThe band is based in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. According to the band's official website, \"The seed was sown in an attic in the middle of a hot summer when friends Jack White and Brendan Benson got together and wrote a song that truly inspired them. This song was '[[Steady, As She Goes]]' and the inspiration led to the creation of a full band with the addition of Lawrence and Keeler.\" The band came together in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] during 2005 and recorded when time allowed for the remainder of the year. Due to the various members' success in other bands, they were quickly dubbed a [[Supergroup (bands)|supergroup]]. The band, however, asserted they were not, saying that the term implies something pre-planned or temporary, whereas they are actually \"a new band made up of old friends.\"<ref name=MTV2>JH (2006).

The first single was \"[[Steady, As She Goes|Steady, As She Goes/Store Bought Bones]]\" and was released as a limited-edition 7-inch, 45 rpm [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]] in Europe on January 30, 2006,<ref name=\"NMEfirstsingle\">[https://www.nme.com/news/white-stripes/22043 The Raconteurs confirm first single] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001023531/http://www.nme.com/news/white-stripes/22043 |date=October 1, 2007 }}, ''[[NME]]'', 2006-01-24</ref> and in North America on March 7, 2006. A CD version of \"Steady, As She Goes\" was released on April 24, 2006, with the B-side \"Bane Rendition\".\n\nThe Raconteurs first performed live at the Academy in [[Liverpool]], UK, on March 20, 2006, launching a short British tour. Their first American date was the following month, on April 20, at [[New York City]]'s [[Irving Plaza]]. Nearly nonstop touring followed, bringing the band to audiences around North America and Europe. The high profile of Jack White meant that even though the band was new, they were able to sell out mid-size venues\u2014a rarity for a band's first tour.\n\n''Broken Boy Soldiers'' was released on May 15, 2006, in the UK on [[Third Man Records|Third Man Recordings]]/[[XL Recordings]] and May 16 in the U.S. on Third Man Recordings/[[V2 Records]]. It entered the UK charts at No.&nbsp;2 and the U.S. charts at No.&nbsp;7.\n\nIn November 2006, the Raconteurs played eight dates as the opening act for [[Bob Dylan]] on the north-eastern leg of his U.S. tour. On November 3, 2006, the Raconteurs performed the song \"Store Bought Bones\" and the title track, \"Broken Boy Soldier\" on ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]''. According to ''[[Planet Sound]]'' (who had reporters in attendance), during \"Store Bought Bones\", White's guitar malfunctioned and they had to re-play the song. This eventually happened four times, with the band breaking up in laughter by the fourth take. The TV airing used edited pieces from all four performances and cut out any laughter. The band's cover of \"[[Teenage Kicks]]\" by [[The Undertones]] appeared on a 40-year anniversary of the [[BBC]] live compilation. They played it live on a [[John Peel]] tribute.\n\nThe band has performed a number of covers during live shows. For instance, the set list usually includes renditions of \"[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]\" (a song written by [[Sonny Bono]] and popularized by both [[Cher]] and [[Nancy Sinatra]]) and \"Headin' for the Texas Border\" by The [[Flamin' Groovies]]. Other songs the band has covered include [[Gnarls Barkley]]'s \"[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]\", [[Bo Diddley]]'s \"[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love?]]\", [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"[[It Ain't Easy (Ron Davies song)|It Ain\u00b4t Easy]]\", [[Love (band)|Love]]'s \"A House Is Not a Motel\", and [[Charley Jordan]]'s \"Keep It Clean\". The band has also covered the song \"Floating\" by the Irish band [[Jape (band)|Jape]], and \"Send Me a Postcard\", by Dutch band [[Shocking Blue]]. They have also performed an old Blues song written by Big Joe Williams in 1935 (popularized by Van Morrison's \"Them\" in 1964), \"Baby, Please Don't Go.\"\n\nIn December 2006, the band's debut album, ''Broken Boy Soldiers'', was awarded the title Album of the Year by Britain's [[Mojo (magazine)|''Mojo'' magazine]]. In 2007, the album was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album]]. The Raconteurs were nominated for two awards at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|49th Annual Grammys]]: one for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] for ''Broken Boy Soldiers'', and another for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] for \"Steady, As She Goes\" although they did not win in either category.<ref>GRAMMY.COM \u2013 49th Annual Grammy Awards Nominee List, {{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061220160454/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx |archivedate=December 20, 2006 }}</ref>\nThe intro and ending of Steady As She Goes is often used to play out Saturday Live, a long running radio programme on BBC Radio4.\n\n===2008\u20132009: ''Consolers of the Lonely''===\n[[Image:Jack White of the Raconteurs shot by Kris Krug.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jack White performing with the band in 2008]]\nThe Raconteurs released their second album, ''[[Consolers of the Lonely]], o''n March 25, 2008.

{"title_page": "Adjoint representation", "text_new": "{{Lie groups |Algebras}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''adjoint representation''' (or '''adjoint action''') of a [[Lie group]] ''G'' is a way of representing the elements of the group as [[linear map|linear transformations]] of the group's [[Lie algebra]], considered as a [[vector space]]. For example, if ''G'' is GL(''n'', ''k'') (the Lie group of [[invertible matrix|''n''-by-''n'' invertible matrices]]) over a fixed field <math>k</math>, then the adjoint representation is the group homomorphism that sends any ''n''-by-''n'' matrix <math> g </math> to an endomorphism of the vector space of all linear transformations of <math>k^n</math> defined by: <math> x \\mapsto g x g^{-1} </math>.\n\nFor any Lie group, this natural [[group representation|representation]] is obtained by linearizing (i.e. taking the [[Differential of a function|differential]] of) the [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of ''G'' on itself by [[conjugation (group theory)|conjugation]]. The adjoint representation can be defined for [[linear algebraic group]]s over arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|fields]].\n\n==Definition==\n{{see also|Representation theory|Lie group#The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group}}\nLet ''G'' be a [[Lie group]], and let\n:<math>\\Psi: G \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(G)</math>\nbe the mapping {{math|''g'' \u21a6 \u03a8<sub>''g''</sub>}},  \nwith Aut(''G'') the [[automorphism group]] of ''G'' and {{math|\u03a8<sub>''g''</sub>: ''G'' \u2192 ''G''}} given by the [[inner automorphism]] (conjugation)\n:<math>\\Psi_g(h)= ghg^{-1}~.</math>\nThis \u03a8 is a [[Lie_group#Homomorphisms_and_isomorphisms|Lie group homomorphism]].\n\nFor each ''g'' in ''G'', define {{math|Ad<sub>''g''</sub>}} to be the [[tangent space|derivative]] of {{math|\u03a8<sub>''g''</sub>}} at the origin:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g = (d\\Psi_g)_e : T_eG \\rightarrow T_eG</math>\nwhere  {{mvar|d}} is the differential and <math>\\mathfrak{g} = T_e G</math> is the [[tangent space]] at the origin  {{mvar|e}} ({{mvar|e}} being the identity element of the group  {{mvar|G}}). Since <math>\\Psi_g</math> is a Lie group automorphism, Ad<sub>''g''</sub> is a Lie algebra automorphism; i.e., an invertible [[linear transformation]] of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> to itself that preserves the [[Lie algebra#Definitions|Lie bracket]]. Moreover, since <math>g \\mapsto \\Psi_g</math> is a group homomorphism, <math>g \\mapsto \\operatorname{Ad}_g</math> too is a group homomorphism.<ref>Indeed, by [[chain rule]], <math>\\operatorname{Ad}_{gh} = d (\\Psi_{gh})_e = d (\\Psi_g \\circ \\Psi_h)_e = d (\\Psi_g)_e \\circ d (\\Psi_h)_e = \\operatorname{Ad}_g \\circ \\operatorname{Ad}_h.</math></ref> Hence, the map\n:<math>\\mathrm{Ad}\\colon G \\to \\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathfrak g), \\, g \\mapsto \\mathrm{Ad}_g</math>\nis a [[group representation]] called the '''adjoint representation''' of ''G''.\n\nIf ''G'' is an [[Lie_group\u2013Lie_algebra_correspondence#Homomorphisms|immersed Lie subgroup]] of the general linear group <math>\\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})</math> (called immersely linear Lie group), then the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> consists of matrices and the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] is the matrix exponential <math>\\operatorname{exp}(X) = e^X</math> for matrices ''X'' with small operator norms. Thus, for ''g'' in ''G'' and small ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, taking the derivative of <math>\\Psi_g(\\operatorname{exp}(tX)) = ge^{t X}g^{-1}</math> at ''t'' = 0, one gets:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g(X) = gX g^{-1}</math>\nwhere on the right we have the products of matrices. If <math>G \\subset \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})</math> is a closed subgroup (that is, ''G'' is a matrix Lie group), then this formula is valid for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak g</math>.\n\nSuccinctly, an adjoint representation is an [[isotropy representation]] associated to the conjugation action of ''G'' around the identity element of ''G''.\n\n===Derivative of Ad===\nOne may always pass from a representation of a Lie group ''G'' to a [[representation of a Lie algebra|representation of its Lie algebra]] by taking the derivative at the identity.\n\nTaking the derivative of the adjoint map\n:<math>\\mathrm{Ad} : G \\to \\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathfrak g)</math>\nat the identity element gives the '''adjoint representation''' of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g = \\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> of ''G'':\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{ad} : & \\, \\mathfrak g \\to \\mathrm{Der}(\\mathfrak g) \\\\\n& \\,x \\mapsto \\operatorname{ad}_x = d(\\operatorname{Ad})_e(x)\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathrm{Der}(\\mathfrak g) = \\operatorname{Lie}(\\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{g}))</math> is the Lie algebra of <math>\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathfrak g)</math> which may be identified with the [[differential algebra#Derivation on a Lie algebra|derivation algebra]] of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. One can show that\n:<math>\\mathrm{ad}_x(y) = [x,y]\\,</math>\nfor all <math>x,y \\in \\mathfrak g</math>, where the right hand side is given (induced) by the [[Lie bracket of vector fields]]. Indeed,<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi\u2013Nomizu|loc=page 41}}</ref> recall that, viewing <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> as the Lie algebra of left-invariant vector fields on ''G'', the bracket on <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is given as:<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi\u2013Nomizu|loc=Proposition 1.9.}}</ref> for left-invariant vector fields ''X'', ''Y'',\n:<math>[X, Y] = \\lim_{t \\to 0} {1 \\over t}(d \\varphi_{-t}(Y) - Y)</math>\nwhere <math>\\varphi_t: G \\to G</math> denotes the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] generated by ''X''. As it turns out, <math>\\varphi_t(g) = g\\varphi_t(e)</math>, roughly because both sides satisfy the same ODE defining the flow. That is, <math>\\varphi_t = R_{\\varphi_t(e)}</math> where <math>R_h</math> denotes the right multiplication by <math>h \\in G</math>. On the other hand, since <math>\\Psi_g = R_{g^{-1}} \\circ L_g</math>, by [[chain rule]],\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g(Y) = d (R_{g^{-1}} \\circ L_g)(Y) = d R_{g^{-1}} (d L_g(Y)) = d R_{g^{-1}}(Y)</math>\nas ''Y'' is left-invariant. Hence,\n:<math>[X, Y] = \\lim_{t \\to 0} {1 \\over t}(\\operatorname{Ad}_{\\varphi_t(e)}(Y) - Y)</math>,\nwhich is what was needed to show.\n\nThus, <math>\\mathrm{ad}_x</math> coincides with the same one defined in [[#Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra]] below. Ad and ad are related through the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]]: Specifically, Ad<sub>exp(''x'')</sub> = exp(ad<sub>''x''</sub>) for all ''x'' in the Lie algebra.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 3.35</ref> It is a consequence of the general result relating Lie group and Lie algebra homomorphisms via the exponential map.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.28</ref>\n\nIf ''G'' is an immersely linear Lie group, then the above computation simplifies: indeed, as noted early, <math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g(Y) = gYg^{-1}</math> and thus with <math>g = e^{tX}</math>,\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_{e^{tX}}(Y) = e^{tX} Y e^{-tX}</math>.\nTaking the derivative of this at <math>t = 0</math>, we have:\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}_X Y = XY - YX</math>.\nThe general case can also be deduced from the linear case: indeed, let <math>G'</math> be an immersely linear Lie group having the same Lie algebra as that of ''G''. Then the derivative of Ad at the identity element for ''G'' and that for ''G{{'}}'' coincide; hence, without loss of generality, ''G'' can be assumed to be ''G{{'}}''.\n\nThe upper-case/lower-case notation is used extensively in the literature.  Thus, for example, a vector {{mvar|x}}    in the algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> generates a [[vector field]] {{mvar|X}}    in the group  {{mvar|G}}.  Similarly, the adjoint map {{math|ad<sub>x</sub>y {{=}} [''x'',''y'']}} of vectors in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is homomorphic{{clarify|map is homomorphic??|date=December 2018}} to the [[Lie derivative]] {{math|L<sub>''X''</sub>''Y'' {{=}} [''X'',''Y'']}} of vector fields on the group  {{mvar|G}} considered as a [[manifold]].\n\nFurther see the [[derivative of the exponential map]].\n\n== Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra ==\nLet <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> be a Lie algebra over some field. Given an element {{mvar|x}} of a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, one defines the adjoint action of {{mvar|x}} on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> as the map \n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}_x :\\mathfrak{g}\\to \\mathfrak{g} \\qquad  \\text{with}   \\qquad \\operatorname{ad}_x (y) = [x,y]</math>\nfor all {{mvar|y}} in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. It is called the '''adjoint endomorphism''' or '''adjoint action'''. (<math>\\operatorname{ad}_x</math> is also often denoted as <math>\\operatorname{ad}(x)</math>.) Since a bracket is bilinear, this determines the [[linear map|linear mapping]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}:\\mathfrak{g} \\to \\operatorname{End}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>\ngiven by {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ad<sub>''x''</sub>}}. Within End<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the bracket is, by definition, given by the commutator of the two operators:\n:<math>[T, S]= T \\circ S - S \\circ T</math>\nwhere <math>\\circ</math> denotes composition of linear maps. Using the above definition of the bracket, the [[Jacobi identity]]\n:<math>[x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]]=0</math> \ntakes the form \n:<math>\\left([\\operatorname{ad}_x,\\operatorname{ad}_y]\\right)(z) = \\left(\\operatorname{ad}_{[x,y]}\\right)(z)</math>\nwhere {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}} are arbitrary elements of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nThis last identity says that <big>ad</big> is a Lie algebra homomorphism; i.e., a linear mapping that takes brackets to brackets. Hence, <big>ad</big> is a [[representation of a Lie algebra]] and is called the '''adjoint representation''' of the algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is finite-dimensional, then End<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\mathfrak{gl}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the Lie algebra of the [[general linear group]] of the vector space <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and if a basis for it is chosen, the composition corresponds to [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nIn a more module-theoretic language, the construction says that <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is a module over itself.\n\nThe kernel of <big>ad</big> is the [[center (algebra)|center]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> (rephrasing of the definition). On the other hand, for each element {{mvar|z}} in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, ad<sub>''z''</sub> obeys the [[General Leibniz rule|Leibniz' law]]:\n:<math>\\delta ([x,y]) = [\\delta(x),y] + [x, \\delta(y)]</math>\nfor all {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in the algebra (the restatement of the Jacobi identity). That is to say, ad<sub>''z''</sub> is a [[Lie algebra extension#Derivations|derivation]] and the image of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> under ad is \na subalgebra of Der<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the space of all derivations of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nWhen <math>\\mathfrak{g} = \\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> is the Lie algebra of a Lie group ''G'', <big>ad</big> is the differential of <big>Ad</big> at the identity element of ''G'' (see [[#Derivative of Ad]] above).\n\nThere is the following formula similar to the binomial formula: for scalars <math>\\alpha, \\beta</math> and Lie algebra elements <math>x, y, z</math>,\n:<math>(\\operatorname{ad}_x - \\alpha - \\beta)^n [y, z] = \\sum_{i = 0}^n \\binom{n}{i}[(\\operatorname{ad}_x - \\alpha)^i y, (\\operatorname{ad}_x - \\beta)^{n - i} z]</math>.\n\n== Structure constants ==\n\nThe explicit matrix elements of the adjoint representation are given by the [[structure constants]] of the algebra.

For example, if ''G'' is GL(''n'', ''k'') (the Lie group of [[invertible matrix|''n''-by-''n'' invertible matrices]]) over a fixed field <math>k</math>, then the adjoint representation is the group homomorphism that sends any ''n''-by-''n'' matrices <math> g </math>, to an endomorphism of the vector space of all linear transformations of <math>k^n</math> defined by: <math> x \\mapsto g x g^{-1} </math>.\n\nFor any Lie group, this natural [[group representation|representation]] is obtained by linearizing (i.e. taking the [[Differential of a function|differential]] of) the [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of ''G'' on itself by [[conjugation (group theory)|conjugation]]. The adjoint representation can be defined for [[linear algebraic group]]s over arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|fields]].\n\n==Definition==\n{{see also|Representation theory|Lie group#The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group}}\nLet ''G'' be a [[Lie group]], and let\n:<math>\\Psi: G \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(G)</math>\nbe the mapping {{math|''g'' \u21a6 \u03a8<sub>''g''</sub>}},  \nwith Aut(''G'') the [[automorphism group]] of ''G'' and {{math|\u03a8<sub>''g''</sub>: ''G'' \u2192 ''G''}} given by the [[inner automorphism]] (conjugation)\n:<math>\\Psi_g(h)= ghg^{-1}~.</math>\nThis \u03a8 is a [[Lie_group#Homomorphisms_and_isomorphisms|Lie group homomorphism]].\n\nFor each ''g'' in ''G'', define {{math|Ad<sub>''g''</sub>}} to be the [[tangent space|derivative]] of {{math|\u03a8<sub>''g''</sub>}} at the origin:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g = (d\\Psi_g)_e : T_eG \\rightarrow T_eG</math>\nwhere  {{mvar|d}} is the differential and <math>\\mathfrak{g} = T_e G</math> is the [[tangent space]] at the origin  {{mvar|e}} ({{mvar|e}} being the identity element of the group  {{mvar|G}}).

Indeed,<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi\u2013Nomizu|loc=page 41}}</ref> recall that, viewing <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> as the Lie algebra of left-invariant vector fields on ''G'', the bracket on <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is given as:<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi\u2013Nomizu|loc=Proposition 1.9.}}</ref> for left-invariant vector fields ''X'', ''Y'',\n:<math>[X, Y] = \\lim_{t \\to 0} {1 \\over t}(d \\varphi_{-t}(Y) - Y)</math>\nwhere <math>\\varphi_t: G \\to G</math> denotes the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] generated by ''X''.

Ad and ad are related through the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]]: Specifically, Ad<sub>exp(''x'')</sub> = exp(ad<sub>''x''</sub>) for all ''x'' in the Lie algebra.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 3.35</ref> It is a consequence of the general result relating Lie group and Lie algebra homomorphisms via the exponential map.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.28</ref>\n\nIf ''G'' is an immersely linear Lie group, then the above computation simplifies: indeed, as noted early, <math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g(Y) = gYg^{-1}</math> and thus with <math>g = e^{tX}</math>,\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_{e^{tX}}(Y) = e^{tX} Y e^{-tX}</math>.\nTaking the derivative of this at <math>t = 0</math>, we have:\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}_X Y = XY - YX</math>.\nThe general case can also be deduced from the linear case: indeed, let <math>G'</math> be an immersely linear Lie group having the same Lie algebra as that of ''G''. Then the derivative of Ad at the identity element for ''G'' and that for ''G{{'}}'' coincide; hence, without loss of generality, ''G'' can be assumed to be ''G{{'}}''.\n\nThe upper-case/lower-case notation is used extensively in the literature.  Thus, for example, a vector {{mvar|x}}    in the algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> generates a [[vector field]] {{mvar|X}}    in the group  {{mvar|G}}.  Similarly, the adjoint map {{math|ad<sub>x</sub>y {{=}} [''x'',''y'']}} of vectors in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is homomorphic{{clarify|map is homomorphic??|date=December 2018}} to the [[Lie derivative]] {{math|L<sub>''X''</sub>''Y'' {{=}} [''X'',''Y'']}} of vector fields on the group  {{mvar|G}} considered as a [[manifold]].\n\nFurther see the [[derivative of the exponential map]].\n\n== Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra ==\nLet <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> be a Lie algebra over some field. Given an element {{mvar|x}} of a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, one defines the adjoint action of {{mvar|x}} on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> as the map \n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}_x :\\mathfrak{g}\\to \\mathfrak{g} \\qquad  \\text{with}   \\qquad \\operatorname{ad}_x (y) = [x,y]</math>\nfor all {{mvar|y}} in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. It is called the '''adjoint endomorphism''' or '''adjoint action'''. (<math>\\operatorname{ad}_x</math> is also often denoted as <math>\\operatorname{ad}(x)</math>.) Since a bracket is bilinear, this determines the [[linear map|linear mapping]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}:\\mathfrak{g} \\to \\operatorname{End}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>\ngiven by {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ad<sub>''x''</sub>}}. Within End<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the bracket is, by definition, given by the commutator of the two operators:\n:<math>[T, S]= T \\circ S - S \\circ T</math>\nwhere <math>\\circ</math> denotes composition of linear maps. Using the above definition of the bracket, the [[Jacobi identity]]\n:<math>[x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]]=0</math> \ntakes the form \n:<math>\\left([\\operatorname{ad}_x,\\operatorname{ad}_y]\\right)(z) = \\left(\\operatorname{ad}_{[x,y]}\\right)(z)</math>\nwhere {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}} are arbitrary elements of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nThis last identity says that <big>ad</big> is a Lie algebra homomorphism; i.e., a linear mapping that takes brackets to brackets. Hence, <big>ad</big> is a [[representation of a Lie algebra]] and is called the '''adjoint representation''' of the algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is finite-dimensional, then End<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\mathfrak{gl}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the Lie algebra of the [[general linear group]] of the vector space <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and if a basis for it is chosen, the composition corresponds to [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nIn a more module-theoretic language, the construction says that <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is a module over itself.\n\nThe kernel of <big>ad</big> is the [[center (algebra)|center]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> (rephrasing of the definition). On the other hand, for each element {{mvar|z}} in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, ad<sub>''z''</sub> obeys the [[General Leibniz rule|Leibniz' law]]:\n:<math>\\delta ([x,y]) = [\\delta(x),y] + [x, \\delta(y)]</math>\nfor all {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in the algebra (the restatement of the Jacobi identity). That is to say, ad<sub>''z''</sub> is a [[Lie algebra extension#Derivations|derivation]] and the image of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> under ad is \na subalgebra of Der<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the space of all derivations of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nWhen <math>\\mathfrak{g} = \\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> is the Lie algebra of a Lie group ''G'', <big>ad</big> is the differential of <big>Ad</big> at the identity element of ''G'' (see [[#Derivative of Ad]] above).\n\nThere is the following formula similar to the binomial formula: for scalars <math>\\alpha, \\beta</math> and Lie algebra elements <math>x, y, z</math>,\n:<math>(\\operatorname{ad}_x - \\alpha - \\beta)^n [y, z] = \\sum_{i = 0}^n \\binom{n}{i}[(\\operatorname{ad}_x - \\alpha)^i y, (\\operatorname{ad}_x - \\beta)^{n - i} z]</math>.\n\n== Structure constants ==\n\nThe explicit matrix elements of the adjoint representation are given by the [[structure constants]] of the algebra.

By the [[first isomorphism theorem]] we have\n:<math>\\mathrm{Ad}(G) \\cong G/Z_G(G_0).</math>\n\nGiven a finite-dimensional real Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, by [[Lie's third theorem]], there is a connected Lie group <math>\\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g})</math> whose Lie algebra is the image of the adjoint representation of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> (i.e., <math>\\operatorname{Lie}(\\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g})) = \\operatorname{ad}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>.) It is called the '''adjoint group''' of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nNow, if <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is the Lie algebra of a connected Lie group ''G'', then <math>\\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g})</math> is the image of the adjoint representation of ''G'': <math>\\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\operatorname{Ad}(G)</math>.\n\n== Roots of a semisimple Lie group ==\nIf ''G'' is [[semisimple group|semisimple]], the non-zero [[weight (representation theory)|weights]] of the adjoint representation form a [[root system]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 7.3</ref> (In general, one needs to pass to the complexification of the Lie algebra before proceeding.)  To see how this works, consider the case ''G'' = SL(''n'', '''R'''). We can take the group of diagonal matrices diag(''t''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''t''<sub>''n''</sub>) as our [[maximal torus]] ''T''.  Conjugation by an element of ''T'' sends\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\na_{11}&a_{12}&\\cdots&a_{1n}\\\\\na_{21}&a_{22}&\\cdots&a_{2n}\\\\\n\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\\na_{n1}&a_{n2}&\\cdots&a_{nn}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\mapsto\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_{11}&t_1t_2^{-1}a_{12}&\\cdots&t_1t_n^{-1}a_{1n}\\\\\nt_2t_1^{-1}a_{21}&a_{22}&\\cdots&t_2t_n^{-1}a_{2n}\\\\\n\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\\nt_nt_1^{-1}a_{n1}&t_nt_2^{-1}a_{n2}&\\cdots&a_{nn}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThus, ''T'' acts trivially on the diagonal part of the Lie algebra of ''G'' and with eigenvectors ''t''<sub>''i''</sub>''t''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>&minus;1</sup> on the various off-diagonal entries.  The roots of ''G'' are the weights diag(''t''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''t''<sub>''n''</sub>) \u2192 ''t''<sub>''i''</sub>''t''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>&minus;1</sup>.  This accounts for the standard description of the root system of ''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;SL<sub>''n''</sub>('''R''') as the set of vectors of the form ''e<sub>i</sub>''\u2212''e<sub>j</sub>''.\n\n=== Example SL(2, R) ===\nWhen computing the root system for one of the simplest cases of Lie Groups, the group SL(2, '''R''') of two dimensional matrices with determinant 1 consists of the set of matrices of the form:\n\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\na & b\\\\\nc & d\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nwith ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' real and ''ad''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''bc''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nA maximal compact connected abelian Lie subgroup, or maximal torus ''T'', is given by the subset of all matrices of the form\n\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nt_1 & 0\\\\\n0 & t_2\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nt_1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1/t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\exp(\\theta) & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\exp(-\\theta) \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nwith <math> t_1 t_2 = 1 </math>. The Lie algebra of the maximal torus is the Cartan subalgebra consisting of the matrices\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\theta & 0\\\\\n0 & -\\theta \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} = \n\\theta\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}-\\theta\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\theta(e_1-e_2).\n</math>\n\nIf we conjugate an element of SL(2, ''R'') by an element of the maximal torus we obtain\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nt_1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1/t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na & b\\\\\nc & d\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1/t_1 & 0\\\\\n0 & t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na t_1 & b t_1 \\\\\nc / t_1 & d / t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 / t_1 & 0\\\\\n0       & t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na       & b t_1^2\\\\\nc t_1^{-2} & d\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe matrices\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 0\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nare then 'eigenvectors' of the conjugation operation with eigenvalues <math>1,1,t_1^2, t_1^{-2}</math>. The function \u039b which gives <math>t_1^2</math> is a multiplicative character, or homomorphism from the group's torus to the underlying field R. The function \u03bb giving \u03b8 is a weight of the Lie Algebra with weight space given by the span of the matrices.\n\nIt is satisfying to show the multiplicativity of the character and the linearity of the weight. It can further be proved that the differential of \u039b can be used to create a weight. It is also educational to consider the case of SL(3, '''R''').\n\n== Variants and analogues ==\nThe adjoint representation can also be defined for [[algebraic group]]s over any field.<!-- even for an elliptic curve? -->{{clarify|give a definition|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe '''co-adjoint representation''' is the [[contragredient representation]] of the adjoint representation.  [[Alexandre Kirillov]] observed that the [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]] of any vector in a co-adjoint representation is a [[symplectic manifold]].  According to the philosophy in [[representation theory]] known as the '''orbit method''' (see also the [[Kirillov character formula]]), the irreducible representations of a Lie group ''G'' should be indexed in some way by its co-adjoint orbits. This relationship is closest in the case of [[nilpotent Lie group]]s.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Fulton-Harris}}\n*{{cite book |author1=Kobayashi, Shoshichi  |author2=Nomizu, Katsumi | title = Foundations of Differential Geometry, Vol. 1 | publisher=Wiley-Interscience | year=1996|edition=New |isbn = 978-0-471-15733-5|title-link=Foundations of Differential Geometry }}\n* {{citation|first=Brian C.|last=Hall|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition= 2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222 |publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3319134666}}.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adjoint Representation Of A Lie Group}}\n[[Category:Representation theory of Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n", "name_user": "Gkpotter", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed plural word and unnecessary comma.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoint_representation"}
