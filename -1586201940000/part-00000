He was married to [[Andromache]], with whom he had an infant son, [[Scamandrius]] (whom the people of Troy called [[Astyanax]]).\n\nDuring the European Middle Ages, Hector figures as one of the [[Nine Worthies]] noted by [[Jacques de Longuyon]], known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, [[Homer]] places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. [[James M. Redfield|James Redfield]] describes Hector as a \"martyr to loyalties, a witness to the things of this world, a hero ready to die for the precious imperfections of ordinary life.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=James M. |last=Redfield |title=Nature and Culture in the Iliad: The Tragedy of Hector |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |date=1994 |page=ix}}</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n\n===Greatest warrior of trojan sex\n\n[[File:Hektor wirft Paris seine Weichlichkeit vor (Tischbein).jpg|thumb|250px|''Hector Admonishes Paris for His Softness and Exhorts Him to Go to War'' by [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein|J. H. W. Tischbein]] (1751\u20131828)]]\n\nAccording to the ''[[Iliad]]'', Hector did not approve of war between the [[Greeks]] and the Trojans.\n\nFor ten years, the Achaeans besieged Troy and their allies in the east. Hector commanded the Trojan army, with a number of subordinates including [[Polydamas (Iliad)|Polydamas]], and his brothers [[Deiphobus]], [[Helenus]] and [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. By all accounts, Hector was the best warrior the Trojans and their allies could field, and his fighting prowess was admired by Greeks and his own people alike.\n\n[[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]], when faced with his attack, described him as what [[Robert Fagles]] translated as an 'incredible dynamite' and a 'maniac'.\n\n====Duel with Protesilaus====\nIn the ''[[Iliad]]'', Hector's exploits in the war prior to the events of the book are recapitulated. He had fought the Greek champion [[Protesilaus]] in single combat at the start of the war and killed him. A prophecy had stated that the first Greek to land on Trojan soil would die. Thus, [[Protesilaus]], [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]], and [[Odysseus]] would not land. Finally, Odysseus threw his shield out and landed on that, and Protesilaus jumped next from his own ship. In the ensuing fight, Hector killed him, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n[[File:Ajax and Hector exchange gifts.jpg|250px|thumb|Ajax and Hector exchange gifts ([[woodcut]] in [[Andrea Alciato|Andreas Alciatus]], ''Emblematum libellus'', 1591).]]\n\n====Duel with Ajax====\nAs described by Homer in the Iliad<ref>''Iliad'', VII 43\u2013305.</ref> at the advice of Hector\u2019s brother [[Helenus]] (who also was divinely inspired) and being told by him that he was not destined to die yet, Hector managed to get both armies seated and challenged any one of the Greek warriors to [[single combat]]. The [[Argives]] were initially reluctant to accept the challenge. However, after [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]'s chiding, nine Greek [[hero]]es stepped up to the challenge and drew by lot to see who was to face Hector. [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] won and fought Hector. Hector was unable to pierce Ajax's famous shield, but Ajax crushed Hector's shield with a rock and stabbed through his armor with a spear, drawing blood, upon which the god Apollo intervened and the duel was ended as the sun was setting. Hector gave Ajax his sword, which Ajax later used to kill himself. Ajax gave Hector his girdle that Achilles later attached to his chariot to drag Hector's corpse around the walls of Troy.\n\nThe Greeks and the Trojans made a truce to bury the dead. In the early dawn the next day, the Greeks took advantage of the truce to build a wall and ditch around the ships while Zeus watched in the distance.<ref>''Iliad'', VII, 433 ''ff.''</ref>\n\n====Duel with Achilles====\nAnother mention of Hector's exploits in the early years of war was given in the [[Iliad]] in book IX. During the embassy to [[Achilles]], Odysseus, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]] and [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] all try to persuade Achilles to rejoin the fight. In his response, Achilles points out that while Hector was terrorizing the Greek forces now, and that while he himself had fought in their front lines, Hector had 'no wish' to take his force far beyond the walls and out from the Skiaian Gate and nearby oak tree. He then claims, 'There he stood up to me alone one day, and he barely escaped my onslaught.'\nAnother duel that took place, although Hector received help from [[Aeneas]] (his cousin<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aeneas</ref>) and Deiphobus, was when Hector rushed to try to save his brother Troilus from Achilles' hands. But he came too late and Troilus had already perished. All Hector could do was to take the lifeless body of Troilus while Achilles escaped after he fought his way through from the Trojans reinforcement.\n\n[[File:Hector Astyanax MN Jatta.jpg|thumb|250px|Hector's last visit with his wife, [[Andromache]], and infant son [[Astyanax]], startled by his father's helmet ([[Apulian vase painting|Apulian red-figure vase]], 370\u2013360 BC)]]\n\nIn the tenth year of the war, observing [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] avoiding combat with [[Menelaus]], Hector upbraids him with having brought trouble on his whole country and now refusing to fight. Paris therefore proposes [[single combat]] between himself and Menelaus, with [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] to go to the victor, ending the war.<ref>''Iliad'', III.</ref> The duel, however, leads to inconclusive results due to intervention by [[Aphrodite]] who leads Paris off the field. After [[Pandarus]]  wounds [[Menelaus]] with an arrow the fight begins again.\n\nThe Greeks attack and drive the Trojans back. Hector must now go out to lead a counter-attack. According to Homer<ref>Iliad, VI 390\u2013480</ref> his wife [[Andromache]], carrying in her arms her son [[Astyanax]], intercepts Hector at the gate, pleading with him not to go out for her sake as well as his son's. Hector knows that Troy and the house of Priam are doomed to fall and that the gloomy fate of his wife and infant son will be to die or go into slavery in a foreign land. With understanding, compassion, and tenderness he explains that he cannot personally refuse to fight, and comforts her with the idea that no one can take him until it is his time to go. The gleaming bronze helmet frightens Astyanax and makes him cry.<ref>This Trojan helmet was made famous by Denys L. Page in ''History and the Homeric Iliad'', Chapter VI, \"Some Mycenaean relics in the Iliad\", as the Greeks do not wear bronze helmets in the poem's [[Oral-formulaic composition|epic formulae]], but they did in the Homeric Age; therefore, scholar Denys L. Page concludes (on other evidence as well) that the bronze helmet of Hector descends in oral poetry from [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times.</ref> Hector takes it off, embraces his wife and son, and for his sake prays aloud to [[Zeus]] that his son might be chief after him, become more glorious in battle than he, to bring home the blood of his enemies, and make his mother proud. Once he left for battle, those in the house began to mourn as they knew he would not return. Hector and Paris pass through the gate and rally the Trojans, raising havoc among the Greeks.\n\n===Trojan counter-attack===\nZeus [[Weighing of souls|weighs the fates]] of the two armies in the balance, and that of the Greeks sinks down. The Trojans press the Greeks into their camp over the ditch and wall and would have laid hands on the ships, but [[Agamemnon]] rallies the Greeks in person. The Trojans are driven off, night falls, and Hector resolves to take the camp and burn the ships the next day. The Trojans bivouac in the field.\n{{quote|A thousand camp-fires gleamed upon the plain ....<ref>''Iliad'', VIII, 542 ''ff.''</ref>}}\n\nThe next day Agamemnon rallies the Greeks and drives the Trojans\n{{quote|like a herd of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them ...<ref>''Iliad'', XI, 171 ''ff.''</ref>}}\nHector refrains from battle until Agamemnon leaves the field, wounded in the arm by a spear. Then Hector rallies the Trojans:\n{{quote|... like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea ...|sign=|source=}}\n[[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]] hinder Hector and win the Greeks some time to retreat, but the Trojans sweep down upon the wall and rain blows upon it. The Greeks in the camp contest the gates to secure entrance for their fleeing warriors. The Trojans try to pull down the ramparts while the Greeks rain arrows upon them. Hector smashes open a gate with a large stone, clears the gate and calls on the Trojans to scale the wall, which they do, and\n{{quote|... all was uproar and confusion.<ref>''Iliad'', XII.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:THAM-Battle at the ships sarcophagus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle at the ships, on a [[Roman Empire|Roman-era]] [[sarcophagus]], 225\u2013250 AD]]\n\nThe battle rages inside the camp. Hector goes down, hit by a stone thrown by Ajax, but [[Apollo]] arrives from Olympus and infuses strength into \"the shepherd of the people\", who orders a chariot attack, with Apollo clearing the way. Many combats, deaths, boasts, threats, epithets, figures of speech, stories, lines of poetry and books of the Iliad later, Hector lays hold of [[Protesilaus]]' ship and calls for fire. The Trojans cannot bring it to him, as Ajax kills everyone who tries. Eventually, Hector breaks Ajax' spear with his sword, forcing him to give ground, and he sets the ship afire.<ref>''Iliad'', XV, end.</ref>\n\nThese events are all according to the will of the gods, who have decreed the fall of Troy, and therefore intend to tempt Achilles back into the war. [[Patroclus]], Achilles' closest companion, disguised in the armor of [[Achilles]], enters the combat leading the [[Myrmidons]] and the rest of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] to force a Trojan withdrawal. After Patroclus has routed the Trojan army, Hector, with the aid of [[Apollo]] and [[Euphorbus]], kills Patroclus, vaunting over him:\n{{quote|\"Wretch! Achilleus, great as he was, could do nothing to help you.\"<ref name=\"The Iliad, book XVI\">The Iliad, book XVI</ref>}}\nThe dying Patroclus foretells Hector's death:\n{{quote|\"You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already death and powerful destiny are standing beside you, to go down under the hands of Aiakos' great son, Achilleus\"<ref name=\"The Iliad, book XVI\" />}}\n\n===Hector's last fight===\n\n{{quote|Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. ... death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of it \u2013 for so [[Zeus]] and his son [[Apollo]] the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.|cite=Spoken by Hector facing [[Achilles]], after a missed spear-throw; ''Iliad'', Book XXII, lines 299\u2013305}}\n\nHector strips the armor of Achilles off the fallen Patroclus and gives it to his men to take back to the city. Glaucus accuses Hector of cowardice for not challenging Ajax. Stung, Hector calls for the armor, puts it on, and uses it to rally the Trojans.  [[Zeus]] regards the donning of a hero's armor as an act of insolence by a fool about to die, but it makes Hector strong for now.<ref>''Iliad'', XVII</ref>\n\nThe next day, the enraged Achilles renounces the wrath that kept him out of action and routs the Trojans, forcing them back to the city. Hector chooses to remain outside the gates of Troy to face Achilles, partly because had he listened to Polydamas and retreated with his troops the previous night, Achilles would not have killed so many Trojans. When he sees Achilles, however, Hector is seized by fear and turns to flee. Achilles chases him around the city three times before Hector masters his fear and turns to face Achilles. But Athena, in the disguise of Hector's brother [[Deiphobus]], has deluded Hector. He requests from Achilles that the victor should return the other's body after the duel, (though Hector himself made it clear he planned to throw the body of Patroclus to the dogs) but Achilles refuses. Achilles hurls his spear at Hector, who dodges it, but Athena brings it back to Achilles' hands without Hector noticing. Hector then throws his own spear at Achilles; it hits his shield and does no injury. When Hector turns to face his supposed brother to retrieve another spear, he sees no one there. At that moment he realizes that he is doomed. Hector decides that he will go down fighting and that men will talk about his bravery in years to come. The desire to achieve ever-lasting honor was one of the most fierce for soldiers living in the timocratic (honor-based) society of the age.\n\n[[File:Triumph of Achilles in Corfu Achilleion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body in [[Troy]]. (A [[fresco]] in the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]], [[Corfu]])]]\nHector pulls out his sword, now his only weapon, and charges. But Achilles grabbed his thrown spears that were delivered to him by the unseen Athena who wore the Hades helmet. Achilles then aimed his spear and pierced the collar bone section of Hector, the only part of the stolen Armor of Achilles that did not protect Hector. The wound was fatal yet allowed Hector to speak to Achilles. In his final moments, Hector begs Achilles for an honorable funeral, but Achilles replies that he will let the dogs and vultures devour Hector's flesh. (Throughout the Homeric poems, several references are made to dogs, vultures, and other creatures that devour the dead. It can be seen as another way of saying one will die.) Hector dies, prophesying that Achilles' death will follow soon:\n\n<blockquote>Be careful now; for I might be made into the gods' curse ... upon you, on that day when Paris and [[Phoibos]] Apollo...destroy you in the Skainan gates, for all your valor.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Iliad|last = Lattimore|first = Richmond|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-226-47049-8|location = |page = 467}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter his death, Achilles slits Hector's heels and passes the girdle that Ajax had given Hector through the slits. He then fastens the girdle to his chariot and drives his fallen enemy through the dust to the [[Danaan]] camp. For the next twelve days, Achilles mistreats the body, but it remains preserved from all injury by [[Apollo]] and [[Aphrodite]]. After these twelve days, the gods can no longer stand watching it and send down two messengers: [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], another messenger god, and Thetis, the mother of Achilles. Thetis has told Achilles to allow King Priam to come and take the body for ransom. Once King Priam has been notified that Achilles will allow him to claim the body, he goes to his strongroom to withdraw the ransom. The ransom King Priam offers includes twelve fine robes, twelve white mantles, several richly embroidered tunics, ten bars of yellow gold, a special gold cup, and several cauldrons. Priam himself goes to claim his son's body, and Hermes grants him safe passage by casting a charm that will make anyone who looks at him fall asleep.\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThink of thy father, and this helpless face behold\nSee him in me, as helpless and as old!\nThough not so wretched: there he yields to me,\nThe first of men in sovereign misery!\nThus forced to kneel, thus groveling to embrace\nThe scourge and ruin of my realm and race;\nSuppliant my children\u2019s murderer to implore,\nAnd kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!\n</poem>\n|cite=Spoken by [[Priam]] to [[Achilles]]; ''Iliad'', Book XXIV, [[Alexander Pope|Pope's]] translation}}\n\nAchilles, moved by Priam's actions and following his mother's orders sent by Zeus, returns Hector's body to Priam and promises him a truce of twelve days to allow the Trojans to perform funeral rites for Hector. Priam returns to Troy with the body of his son, and it is given full funeral honors. Even Helen mourns Hector, for he had always been kind to her and protected her from spite. The last lines of the ''Iliad'' are dedicated to Hector's funeral. Homer concludes by referring to the Trojan prince as the \"Breaker of Horses.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Pseudo-Apollodorus |title=[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]] |at=III, xii, 5\u20136; \"Epitome\" IV, 2}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the dead Hector appears to Aeneas in a dream urging him to flee Troy.<ref>https://news.ku.edu/2015/05/22/were-some-dreams-ancient-roman-poetry-precursor-film</ref>\n\n==Historical references==\nThe most valuable historical evidence for the Battle of Troy are treaties and letters mentioned in [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[cuneiform]] [[Hittite texts#New Kingdom|texts]] of the same approximate era, which mention an unruly Western Anatolian warlord named ''[[Piyama-Radu]]'' (possibly Priam) and his successor ''[[Alaksandu]]'' (possibly Alexander, the nickname of [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]) both based in ''[[Wilusa]]'' (possibly [[Troy|Ilion/Ilios]]), as well as the god ''Apaliunas'' (possibly [[Apollo]]).\n\nOther such pieces of evidence are names of Trojan heroes in [[Linear B]] tablets. Twenty out of fifty-eight men's names also known from Homer, including {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc01\ud800\udc12\ud800\udc35}}, ''E-ko-to'' (Hector),<ref>{{cite web |title=The Linear B word ''e-ko-to'' |website=Palaeolexicon: Word study tool for ancient languages |url= http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16717}}</ref> are Trojan warriors and some, including Hector, are in a servile capacity.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=Michael|editor1-last=Ventris |editor2-first=John|editor2-last=Chadwick |title=Documents in Mycenaean Greek |edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1973 |page=104 |isbn=978-0-521-08558-8}}</ref> No such conclusion that they are the offspring of Trojan captive women is warranted.

He was married to [[Andromache]], with whom he had an infant son, [[Scamandrius]] (whom the people of Troy called [[Astyanax]]).\n\nDuring the European Middle Ages, Hector figures as one of the [[Nine Worthies]] noted by [[Jacques de Longuyon]], known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, [[Homer]] places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. [[James M. Redfield|James Redfield]] describes Hector as a \"martyr to loyalties, a witness to the things of this world, a hero ready to die for the precious imperfections of ordinary life.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=James M. |last=Redfield |title=Nature and Culture in the Iliad: The Tragedy of Hector |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |date=1994 |page=ix}}</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n\n===Greatest warrior of Troy===\n\n[[File:Hektor wirft Paris seine Weichlichkeit vor (Tischbein).jpg|thumb|250px|''Hector Admonishes Paris for His Softness and Exhorts Him to Go to War'' by [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein|J. H. W. Tischbein]] (1751\u20131828)]]\n\nAccording to the ''[[Iliad]]'', Hector did not approve of war between the [[Greeks]] and the Trojans.\n\nFor ten years, the Achaeans besieged Troy and their allies in the east. Hector commanded the Trojan army, with a number of subordinates including [[Polydamas (Iliad)|Polydamas]], and his brothers [[Deiphobus]], [[Helenus]] and [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. By all accounts, Hector was the best warrior the Trojans and their allies could field, and his fighting prowess was admired by Greeks and his own people alike.\n\n[[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]], when faced with his attack, described him as what [[Robert Fagles]] translated as an 'incredible dynamite' and a 'maniac'.\n\n====Duel with Protesilaus====\nIn the ''[[Iliad]]'', Hector's exploits in the war prior to the events of the book are recapitulated. He had fought the Greek champion [[Protesilaus]] in single combat at the start of the war and killed him. A prophecy had stated that the first Greek to land on Trojan soil would die. Thus, [[Protesilaus]], [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]], and [[Odysseus]] would not land. Finally, Odysseus threw his shield out and landed on that, and Protesilaus jumped next from his own ship. In the ensuing fight, Hector killed him, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n[[File:Ajax and Hector exchange gifts.jpg|250px|thumb|Ajax and Hector exchange gifts ([[woodcut]] in [[Andrea Alciato|Andreas Alciatus]], ''Emblematum libellus'', 1591).]]\n\n====Duel with Ajax====\nAs described by Homer in the Iliad<ref>''Iliad'', VII 43\u2013305.</ref> at the advice of Hector\u2019s brother [[Helenus]] (who also was divinely inspired) and being told by him that he was not destined to die yet, Hector managed to get both armies seated and challenged any one of the Greek warriors to [[single combat]]. The [[Argives]] were initially reluctant to accept the challenge. However, after [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]'s chiding, nine Greek [[hero]]es stepped up to the challenge and drew by lot to see who was to face Hector. [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] won and fought Hector. Hector was unable to pierce Ajax's famous shield, but Ajax crushed Hector's shield with a rock and stabbed through his armor with a spear, drawing blood, upon which the god Apollo intervened and the duel was ended as the sun was setting. Hector gave Ajax his sword, which Ajax later used to kill himself. Ajax gave Hector his girdle that Achilles later attached to his chariot to drag Hector's corpse around the walls of Troy.\n\nThe Greeks and the Trojans made a truce to bury the dead. In the early dawn the next day, the Greeks took advantage of the truce to build a wall and ditch around the ships while Zeus watched in the distance.<ref>''Iliad'', VII, 433 ''ff.''</ref>\n\n====Duel with Achilles====\nAnother mention of Hector's exploits in the early years of war was given in the [[Iliad]] in book IX. During the embassy to [[Achilles]], Odysseus, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]] and [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] all try to persuade Achilles to rejoin the fight. In his response, Achilles points out that while Hector was terrorizing the Greek forces now, and that while he himself had fought in their front lines, Hector had 'no wish' to take his force far beyond the walls and out from the Skiaian Gate and nearby oak tree. He then claims, 'There he stood up to me alone one day, and he barely escaped my onslaught.'\nAnother duel that took place, although Hector received help from [[Aeneas]] (his cousin<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aeneas</ref>) and Deiphobus, was when Hector rushed to try to save his brother Troilus from Achilles' hands. But he came too late and Troilus had already perished. All Hector could do was to take the lifeless body of Troilus while Achilles escaped after he fought his way through from the Trojans reinforcement.\n\n[[File:Hector Astyanax MN Jatta.jpg|thumb|250px|Hector's last visit with his wife, [[Andromache]], and infant son [[Astyanax]], startled by his father's helmet ([[Apulian vase painting|Apulian red-figure vase]], 370\u2013360 BC)]]\n\nIn the tenth year of the war, observing [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] avoiding combat with [[Menelaus]], Hector upbraids him with having brought trouble on his whole country and now refusing to fight. Paris therefore proposes [[single combat]] between himself and Menelaus, with [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] to go to the victor, ending the war.<ref>''Iliad'', III.</ref> The duel, however, leads to inconclusive results due to intervention by [[Aphrodite]] who leads Paris off the field. After [[Pandarus]]  wounds [[Menelaus]] with an arrow the fight begins again.\n\nThe Greeks attack and drive the Trojans back. Hector must now go out to lead a counter-attack. According to Homer<ref>Iliad, VI 390\u2013480</ref> his wife [[Andromache]], carrying in her arms her son [[Astyanax]], intercepts Hector at the gate, pleading with him not to go out for her sake as well as his son's. Hector knows that Troy and the house of Priam are doomed to fall and that the gloomy fate of his wife and infant son will be to die or go into slavery in a foreign land. With understanding, compassion, and tenderness he explains that he cannot personally refuse to fight, and comforts her with the idea that no one can take him until it is his time to go. The gleaming bronze helmet frightens Astyanax and makes him cry.<ref>This Trojan helmet was made famous by Denys L. Page in ''History and the Homeric Iliad'', Chapter VI, \"Some Mycenaean relics in the Iliad\", as the Greeks do not wear bronze helmets in the poem's [[Oral-formulaic composition|epic formulae]], but they did in the Homeric Age; therefore, scholar Denys L. Page concludes (on other evidence as well) that the bronze helmet of Hector descends in oral poetry from [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times.</ref> Hector takes it off, embraces his wife and son, and for his sake prays aloud to [[Zeus]] that his son might be chief after him, become more glorious in battle than he, to bring home the blood of his enemies, and make his mother proud. Once he left for battle, those in the house began to mourn as they knew he would not return. Hector and Paris pass through the gate and rally the Trojans, raising havoc among the Greeks.\n\n===Trojan counter-attack===\nZeus [[Weighing of souls|weighs the fates]] of the two armies in the balance, and that of the Greeks sinks down. The Trojans press the Greeks into their camp over the ditch and wall and would have laid hands on the ships, but [[Agamemnon]] rallies the Greeks in person. The Trojans are driven off, night falls, and Hector resolves to take the camp and burn the ships the next day. The Trojans bivouac in the field.\n{{quote|A thousand camp-fires gleamed upon the plain ....<ref>''Iliad'', VIII, 542 ''ff.''</ref>}}\n\nThe next day Agamemnon rallies the Greeks and drives the Trojans\n{{quote|like a herd of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them ...<ref>''Iliad'', XI, 171 ''ff.''</ref>}}\nHector refrains from battle until Agamemnon leaves the field, wounded in the arm by a spear. Then Hector rallies the Trojans:\n{{quote|... like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea ...|sign=|source=}}\n[[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]] hinder Hector and win the Greeks some time to retreat, but the Trojans sweep down upon the wall and rain blows upon it. The Greeks in the camp contest the gates to secure entrance for their fleeing warriors. The Trojans try to pull down the ramparts while the Greeks rain arrows upon them. Hector smashes open a gate with a large stone, clears the gate and calls on the Trojans to scale the wall, which they do, and\n{{quote|... all was uproar and confusion.<ref>''Iliad'', XII.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:THAM-Battle at the ships sarcophagus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle at the ships, on a [[Roman Empire|Roman-era]] [[sarcophagus]], 225\u2013250 AD]]\n\nThe battle rages inside the camp. Hector goes down, hit by a stone thrown by Ajax, but [[Apollo]] arrives from Olympus and infuses strength into \"the shepherd of the people\", who orders a chariot attack, with Apollo clearing the way. Many combats, deaths, boasts, threats, epithets, figures of speech, stories, lines of poetry and books of the Iliad later, Hector lays hold of [[Protesilaus]]' ship and calls for fire. The Trojans cannot bring it to him, as Ajax kills everyone who tries. Eventually, Hector breaks Ajax' spear with his sword, forcing him to give ground, and he sets the ship afire.<ref>''Iliad'', XV, end.</ref>\n\nThese events are all according to the will of the gods, who have decreed the fall of Troy, and therefore intend to tempt Achilles back into the war. [[Patroclus]], Achilles' closest companion, disguised in the armor of [[Achilles]], enters the combat leading the [[Myrmidons]] and the rest of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] to force a Trojan withdrawal. After Patroclus has routed the Trojan army, Hector, with the aid of [[Apollo]] and [[Euphorbus]], kills Patroclus, vaunting over him:\n{{quote|\"Wretch! Achilleus, great as he was, could do nothing to help you.\"<ref name=\"The Iliad, book XVI\">The Iliad, book XVI</ref>}}\nThe dying Patroclus foretells Hector's death:\n{{quote|\"You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already death and powerful destiny are standing beside you, to go down under the hands of Aiakos' great son, Achilleus\"<ref name=\"The Iliad, book XVI\" />}}\n\n===Hector's last fight===\n\n{{quote|Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. ... death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of it \u2013 for so [[Zeus]] and his son [[Apollo]] the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.|cite=Spoken by Hector facing [[Achilles]], after a missed spear-throw; ''Iliad'', Book XXII, lines 299\u2013305}}\n\nHector strips the armor of Achilles off the fallen Patroclus and gives it to his men to take back to the city. Glaucus accuses Hector of cowardice for not challenging Ajax. Stung, Hector calls for the armor, puts it on, and uses it to rally the Trojans.  [[Zeus]] regards the donning of a hero's armor as an act of insolence by a fool about to die, but it makes Hector strong for now.<ref>''Iliad'', XVII</ref>\n\nThe next day, the enraged Achilles renounces the wrath that kept him out of action and routs the Trojans, forcing them back to the city. Hector chooses to remain outside the gates of Troy to face Achilles, partly because had he listened to Polydamas and retreated with his troops the previous night, Achilles would not have killed so many Trojans. When he sees Achilles, however, Hector is seized by fear and turns to flee. Achilles chases him around the city three times before Hector masters his fear and turns to face Achilles. But Athena, in the disguise of Hector's brother [[Deiphobus]], has deluded Hector. He requests from Achilles that the victor should return the other's body after the duel, (though Hector himself made it clear he planned to throw the body of Patroclus to the dogs) but Achilles refuses. Achilles hurls his spear at Hector, who dodges it, but Athena brings it back to Achilles' hands without Hector noticing. Hector then throws his own spear at Achilles; it hits his shield and does no injury. When Hector turns to face his supposed brother to retrieve another spear, he sees no one there. At that moment he realizes that he is doomed. Hector decides that he will go down fighting and that men will talk about his bravery in years to come. The desire to achieve ever-lasting honor was one of the most fierce for soldiers living in the timocratic (honor-based) society of the age.\n\n[[File:Triumph of Achilles in Corfu Achilleion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body in [[Troy]]. (A [[fresco]] in the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]], [[Corfu]])]]\nHector pulls out his sword, now his only weapon, and charges. But Achilles grabbed his thrown spears that were delivered to him by the unseen Athena who wore the Hades helmet. Achilles then aimed his spear and pierced the collar bone section of Hector, the only part of the stolen Armor of Achilles that did not protect Hector. The wound was fatal yet allowed Hector to speak to Achilles. In his final moments, Hector begs Achilles for an honorable funeral, but Achilles replies that he will let the dogs and vultures devour Hector's flesh. (Throughout the Homeric poems, several references are made to dogs, vultures, and other creatures that devour the dead. It can be seen as another way of saying one will die.) Hector dies, prophesying that Achilles' death will follow soon:\n\n<blockquote>Be careful now; for I might be made into the gods' curse ... upon you, on that day when Paris and [[Phoibos]] Apollo...destroy you in the Skainan gates, for all your valor.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Iliad|last = Lattimore|first = Richmond|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-226-47049-8|location = |page = 467}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter his death, Achilles slits Hector's heels and passes the girdle that Ajax had given Hector through the slits. He then fastens the girdle to his chariot and drives his fallen enemy through the dust to the [[Danaan]] camp. For the next twelve days, Achilles mistreats the body, but it remains preserved from all injury by [[Apollo]] and [[Aphrodite]]. After these twelve days, the gods can no longer stand watching it and send down two messengers: [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], another messenger god, and Thetis, the mother of Achilles. Thetis has told Achilles to allow King Priam to come and take the body for ransom. Once King Priam has been notified that Achilles will allow him to claim the body, he goes to his strongroom to withdraw the ransom. The ransom King Priam offers includes twelve fine robes, twelve white mantles, several richly embroidered tunics, ten bars of yellow gold, a special gold cup, and several cauldrons. Priam himself goes to claim his son's body, and Hermes grants him safe passage by casting a charm that will make anyone who looks at him fall asleep.\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThink of thy father, and this helpless face behold\nSee him in me, as helpless and as old!\nThough not so wretched: there he yields to me,\nThe first of men in sovereign misery!\nThus forced to kneel, thus groveling to embrace\nThe scourge and ruin of my realm and race;\nSuppliant my children\u2019s murderer to implore,\nAnd kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!\n</poem>\n|cite=Spoken by [[Priam]] to [[Achilles]]; ''Iliad'', Book XXIV, [[Alexander Pope|Pope's]] translation}}\n\nAchilles, moved by Priam's actions and following his mother's orders sent by Zeus, returns Hector's body to Priam and promises him a truce of twelve days to allow the Trojans to perform funeral rites for Hector. Priam returns to Troy with the body of his son, and it is given full funeral honors. Even Helen mourns Hector, for he had always been kind to her and protected her from spite. The last lines of the ''Iliad'' are dedicated to Hector's funeral. Homer concludes by referring to the Trojan prince as the \"Breaker of Horses.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Pseudo-Apollodorus |title=[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]] |at=III, xii, 5\u20136; \"Epitome\" IV, 2}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the dead Hector appears to Aeneas in a dream urging him to flee Troy.<ref>https://news.ku.edu/2015/05/22/were-some-dreams-ancient-roman-poetry-precursor-film</ref>\n\n==Historical references==\nThe most valuable historical evidence for the Battle of Troy are treaties and letters mentioned in [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[cuneiform]] [[Hittite texts#New Kingdom|texts]] of the same approximate era, which mention an unruly Western Anatolian warlord named ''[[Piyama-Radu]]'' (possibly Priam) and his successor ''[[Alaksandu]]'' (possibly Alexander, the nickname of [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]) both based in ''[[Wilusa]]'' (possibly [[Troy|Ilion/Ilios]]), as well as the god ''Apaliunas'' (possibly [[Apollo]]).\n\nOther such pieces of evidence are names of Trojan heroes in [[Linear B]] tablets.

Once the group reach the city, they throw a party that turns into a confrontation between Daisy, Tom and Gatsby. Though Gatsby insisted that Daisy never loved Tom, Daisy admits that she loves both Tom and Gatsby. The party ends with Daisy driving Gatsby out of New York City in Gatsby's car, while Tom leaves with Nick and Jordan. Tom's mistress Myrtle Wilson, who earlier had a falling out with Tom, runs in front of Gatsby's car in hopes of reconciling with Tom. Daisy does not see her until it is too late, and runs her over. Daisy, panicked, drives away from the scene of the accident. In her home in East Egg, Gatsby assures her that he will take the blame. Tom tells George, Myrtle's husband, that it was Gatsby that killed Myrtle. George goes to Gatsby's home in West Egg and shoots Gatsby dead before turning the gun on himself.

She fakes ignorance when speaking in Tom's presence but then reveals her actual feelings to Nick, including the fact that she had hoped her daughter would be unintelligent. From this, it is implied that her mannerisms are not some mere attempt at fooling those around her but actually contribute to an ongoing effort to serve as a role model toward her daughter and be directly responsible for her not learning much and becoming the \"beautiful little fool\" that she had aspired to have for a child. Daisy's motivations in wanting this are revealed by her to be that of hoping that her daughter is spared the unpleasant events that can occur in one's life and rooted in her view that she will not be affected by the emotional pain of her life as in being moronic, she cannot understand the events transpiring around her.\n\nThough she is faithful to her husband in the years of their marriage leading up to Gatsby's return, she jumps nearly instantly at the chance of being able to have an affair with Gatsby. While it appears at first that this is a mere relationship of lust between two former lovers that are seeking to reignite an old flame, it is later revealed by Daisy's words to Tom after he learns of the relationship that she went along with it due to her feeling of neglect by her husband. Not only did her neglect drive her to the point of breaking a vow, but so did her ambitions to have an actual fulfilling relationship for the first time since shortly after she married, as Daisy reveals the lack of intimacy between her and Tom, further evidenced by his continued decline to show her any type of consideration in their shared appearances. Daisy's reluctance to accept Tom's claims of remorse demonstrate that her trust is not earned easily and the fact that she continues seeing Gatsby following this proves that she was not as concerned with the consequences of her cheating than that of her happiness.\n\nLooking at Daisy's character, one can see she did care for Gatsby, though maybe not as much as she ended up caring for Tom. Daisy was important to Gatsby because Daisy made Gatsby feel loved. Though no matter what Gatsby did to win Daisy's affection, she married Tom and remained married to him despite Gatsby's pursuit of her. \u201c[Gatsby\u2019s] efforts to attain Daisy\u2026are no more successful, as she abandons him and he realizes too late that he has set his sights on the wrong goal.\u201d <ref>Comeau, Patrice, \"Boats Against the Current: The American Dream as Death Denial in F.

By 1917, Daisy had several suitors of her same class, but fell in love with [[Jay Gatsby]], a poor soldier. Before Gatsby left for war, Daisy promised to wait for him. After Gatsby started attending [[Trinity College, Oxford]], Daisy sent him a letter revealing that she had married Tom Buchanan. During the marriage, Daisy gave birth to a daughter, Pammy, who Daisy had hoped would be \"a beautiful little fool.\" Daisy and her family settled in East Egg, a wealthy old money enclave on [[Long Island]].\n\nAfter her cousin [[Nick Carraway]] arrives in West Egg, the neighboring island, he meets Gatsby, who by now has become extremely wealthy.

Once the group reach the city, they throw a party that turns into a confrontation between Daisy, Tom and Gatsby. Though Gatsby insisted that Daisy never loved Tom, Daisy admits that she loves both Tom and Gatsby. The party ends with Daisy driving Gatsby out of New York City in Gatsby's car, while Tom leaves with Nick and Jordan. Tom's mistress Myrtle Wilson, who earlier had a falling out with Tom, runs in front of Gatsby's car in hopes of reconciling with Tom. Daisy does not see her until it is too late, and runs her over. Daisy, panicked, drives away from the scene of the accident. In her home in East Egg, Gatsby assures her that he will take the blame. Tom tells George, Myrtle's husband, that it was Gatsby that killed Myrtle. George goes to Gatsby's home in West Egg and shoots Gatsby dead before turning the gun on himself. After Gatsby's murder, Daisy, Tom, and their daughter leave East Egg, having no forwarding address.\n\n=== Film and other adaptations ===\n[[Image:Lois_Wilson_(actress)_by_Edwin_Bower_Hesser.jpg|thumb|right|150px|link=Lois Wilson (actress)|Actress [[Lois Wilson (actress)|Lois Wilson]] portrayed Daisy in the [[The Great Gatsby (1926 film)|1926 film version]].]]\nThe [[The Great Gatsby (1926 film)|first adaptation of ''The Great Gatsby'']] was a silent film produced in 1926 and featured [[Lois Wilson (actress)|Lois Wilson]] as Daisy.

She fakes ignorance when speaking in Tom's presence but then reveals her actual feelings to Nick, including the fact that she had hoped her daughter would be unintelligent. From this, it is implied that her mannerisms are not some mere attempt at fooling those around her but actually contribute to an ongoing effort to serve as a role model toward her daughter and be directly responsible for her not learning much and becoming the \"beautiful little fool\" that she had aspired to have for a child. Daisy's motivations in wanting this are revealed by her to be that of hoping that her daughter is spared the unpleasant events that can occur in one's life and rooted in her view that she will not be affected by the emotional pain of her life as in being moronic, she cannot understand the events transpiring around her.\n\nThough she is faithful to her husband in the years of their marriage leading up to Gatsby's return, she jumps nearly instantly at the chance of being able to have an affair with Gatsby. While it appears at first that this is a mere relationship of lust between two former lovers that are seeking to reignite an old flame, it is later revealed by Daisy's words to Tom after he learns of the relationship that she went along with it due to her feeling of neglect by her husband. Not only did her neglect drive her to the point of breaking a vow, but so did her ambitions to have an actual fulfilling relationship for the first time since shortly after she married, as Daisy reveals the lack of intimacy between her and Tom, further evidenced by his continued decline to show her any type of consideration in their shared appearances. Daisy's reluctance to accept Tom's claims of remorse demonstrate that her trust is not earned easily and the fact that she continues seeing Gatsby following this proves that she was not as concerned with the consequences of her cheating than that of her happiness.\n\nLooking at Daisy's character, one can see she did care for Gatsby, though maybe not as much as she ended up caring for Tom. Daisy was important to Gatsby because Daisy made Gatsby feel loved. Though no matter what Gatsby did to win Daisy's affection, she married Tom and remained married to him despite Gatsby's pursuit of her. \u201c[Gatsby\u2019s] efforts to attain Daisy\u2026are no more successful, as she abandons him and he realizes too late that he has set his sights on the wrong goal.\u201d <ref>Comeau, Patrice, \"Boats Against the Current: The American Dream as Death Denial in F.

It was released on November 12, 1996, by [[Death Row Records]] and [[Interscope Records]]. After the success of his debut album ''[[Doggystyle]]'' (1993), Snoop was charged with murder and in 1995, spent time preparing for the case that went to trial. In February 1996, he was cleared of all charges and began working on his second album without [[Dr. Dre]] providing work as a [[record producer]]. This was Snoop's final album on Death Row Records under his name of ''Snoop Doggy Dogg''. Recording sessions took place from February 1996 to October 1996, with [[Suge Knight]] filling in as the [[Executive producer#Music|executive producer]] on the album, alongside the additional production from several [[record producer]]s such as [[DJ Pooh]], [[Daz Dillinger]], [[Soopafly]] and [[L.T. Hutton]]; as well as [[guest appearance]]s from [[Charlie Wilson (musician)|Charlie Wilson]], [[Kurupt|Kurupt tha Kingpin]], [[Tray Dee]] and [[Warren G]], among others.\n\nThe album debuted at number one during the week of November 12, 1996, selling over 420,000 copies, but it failed to match the commercial success of ''Doggystyle''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22&dq=snoop+dogg+bubbling+under&hl=pt-BR&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwilscbQ97XNAhXFh5AKHQIPAaIQ6AEIJzAB#v=onepage&q=snoop%20dogg%20bubbling%20under&f=false |title=Billboard magazine - August 22, 1998 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=June 20, 2016}}</ref> [[Dr. Dre]] had left Death Row to his partner [[Suge Knight]], who was indicted for racketeering by the end of 1996. ''Tha Doggfather'' was also released only one week after another Death Row release, the first posthumous album by [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]], ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]'', which debuted at number one. Consequently, Snoop's second album stalled at sales of two million copies.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1992, Snoop Dogg featured on the album ''[[The Chronic]]'' by close friend Dr. Dre, which was a great success.\n\nIn 1993, Snoop and Dr. Dre began work on ''Doggystyle'' which was also very popular and acclaimed. During the recording of ''Doggystyle'' Snoop became a defendant in a murder case which saw his acquittal shortly before this album was released, which led him to no longer live the \"gangsta\" lifestyle he portrayed in his records.\n\nDr. Dre, who was Death Row Records' in-house producer, had left earlier in 1996 to start [[Aftermath Entertainment|his own label]], which led Snoop's first cousin Daz Dillinger to become Death Row's head producer; he worked on this record. The [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|murder of Snoop's close friend and fellow rapper, label-mate Tupac Shakur]] in September 1996 also weighed on him heavily; Shakur appears on the closing track \"Outro\", under the name \"Makaveli\", which he began using a short while before his death. \n\n==Release==\n''Tha Doggfather'' charted at number one on both the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] charts. To date, the album sold two million copies in the United States and sold better internationally than its predecessor, \"Doggystyle\" (1993).\n\n==Music==\n\n===Production===\nDuring the departure of Dr. Dre from Death Row Records, the majority of this album was produced and mixed by [[DJ Pooh]]. In addition to DJ Pooh, Daz Dillinger and several other producers contributed to this album. In 1996, in an interview with [[Rap City (BET program)|Rap City]], Snoop Dogg revealed that he had been working with Dr. Dre for this album; however, he had been prevented from doing so by Suge Knight. The album samples songs such as \"It's Like That\" performed by [[Run-D.M.C.]], \"[[Vapors (song)|Vapors]]\" performed by [[Biz Markie]], \"More Bounce to the Ounce\" performed by [[Zapp & Roger]], and \"[[Oops Up Side Your Head]]\" performed by [[The Gap Band]]. The Doggfather also marked the debut of Snoop Dogg as a [[record producer]] on the track \"(O.J.) Wake Up\". Snoop Dogg also was beginning to be acknowledged on how to play [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] by a high-profile producer named [[L.T. Hutton]], who led a hand providing some production on that track as well.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asSDVUq8HaY |title=Snoop Dogg Rap City Interview (Part 2) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref>\n\nThe illustration on the back cover of the CD was done by Joe Cool, the same artist who did the front cover of Snoop's previous album ''Doggystyle''.\n\n===Lyrics===\nCompared to Doggystyle, the lyrics are much less violent and controversial. On ''Tha Doggfather'', Snoop Dogg wanted to present a more positive image in his lyrics, a reflection of his maturation as an artist and as a new father.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er-CVjntHlA |title=Snoop Dogg Rap City Interview (Part 1) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> On December 3, 2006, in an interview with [[Vh1]], Snoop Dogg revealed the differences between ''Doggystyle'' and ''Tha Doggfather'', stating, \"I think ''Tha Doggfather'' was a rebirth of me, as far as me being more positive on what I was tryin' to say and, you know, tryin' to live the life through my music, instead of me just livin' my life, tryin' to show people that my life... wasn't like my music...I'm not gonna glorify none of this negativity that Death Row wanted me to do. I'm gonna bring a positive side of music.\" Although his new lyrical direction was met with mixed feelings from fans and critics alike, Snoop Dogg still thinks of the album as a success: \"I enjoyed it and everywhere I go around the world people, you know, I sign more Doggfather records than any other record I put out. That's the one I sign the most and I'm proud at the thang I did and the thang is... sometimes you can outgrow your fans\".<ref>{{cite video |url=http://www.vh1.com/video/misc/122939/on-the-doggfather.jhtml#artist=1133 |title=On \"Tha Doggfather\" by Snoop Dogg |publisher=[[VH1]] |accessdate={{date|2011-10-01|mdy}}}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical reaction ===\n{{Album reviews\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]] \n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r244077|tab=review |label=\"Snoop Dogg: ''Tha Doggfather'' |first=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |accessdate={{date|2011-10-01|mdy}}}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n|rev2Score = B+<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,295271,00.html |title=Music Review: 'Tha Doggfather' (1996) |first=J.D. |last=Considine |authorlink=J.D.

In a February issue of [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] magazine, Dr. Dre stated his feelings on the album and said \"But to be perfectly honest, I don't like Snoop's new album. And it has nothing to do with me not working him, because I'm just like everybody else: I like it, or I don't. The first time I heard the single, I was grooving to it, but then I really started to get into the production and how it was sounding, you know? The first time you hear some shit, you just listen to it to get your groove on, but after that, I start breaking songs down. There's really nothing that was said on there that hasn't been said 50 times before.\"<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wF1pZCI8MZYC&pg=PA50&dq=snoop+dogg+tha+doggfather&hl=en&ei=bTf1TZKNFpGosAOHr7W2Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CE4Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q=snoop%20dogg%20tha%20doggfather&f=false& |title=Trouble Funk |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |page=50 |date=February 1997 |issn=0886-3032}}</ref>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the album stating that \"Even without Dr. Dre behind the board, Snoop and his studio team concoct an intoxicating blend of old-school funk and gangsta cool\", but also noted that \"There's not much to love in the album's attitude toward sex, drugs, and first-degree murder.\" [[Muzik]] said, \"...a more angular, spiky, old school-influenced vehicle for the Dogg Father to strut his matter-of-act rhymes over... you [are taken in] by the strength of the rhyming...\". [[Melody Maker]] ranked it #49 on Melody Maker's list of 1996's 'Albums Of The Year'. The [[Los Angeles Times]] reported that \"Snoop still is one of rap's most electrifying performers. But unlike \"[[Doggystyle]]\" and the \"[[Murder Was the Case]]\" soundtrack, few of the beats on this album rival his rapping prowess.\" They complimented some of the tracks, calling 'Doggfather' \"... the epitome of cool smoothness. Over a slow-rolling Daz and DJ Pooh track\" 'Freestyle Conversation' \"...an Outkast-style exercise in which Snoop speaks a mile a minute, but still manages to maintain a funky rhythm\", 'Gold Rush' a \"funky pistolero track\" and the [[Biz Markie]] remake '[[Vapors (song)|Vapors]]' \"the album's real gem\". The review went on to conclude that \"Tha Doggfather may not be Doggystyle, but Snoop shows that he has the prowess and the talent to survive.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-10/entertainment/ca-63105_1_tha-doggfather& | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Snoop Still Has Some Bite | date=November 10, 1996}}</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' predicted that the album would chart in the top ten due to his presence in the music industry. They also stated that \"The album has a few obligatory mentions of sexual exploits and gun-toting, usually delegated to guest rappers. But most of the raps are about his position as a hit-maker. He still has one of the most distinctive deliveries in rap: a casual, nasal, conversational tone that sounds leisurely even when he's barreling forward. His producers are a little less slick than Dr. Dre was, but they have supplied swampy bass riffs and catchy backup choruses, drawing heavily (like Dr. Dre) on George Clinton's P-Funk. Snoop Doggy Dogg insists, and ''Tha Doggfather'' does that, maintaining a party atmosphere. Yet while it insists that gangsta rap isn't dead, it plays down tough-guy tales in favor of a star's pronouncements.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/26/arts/machismo-in-rap-atop-the-charts.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jon | last=Pareles | title=Machismo In Rap Atop The Charts | date=November 26, 1996}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that the album runs on too long at over 70 minutes and \"Though it works the same G-funk territory, the bass is less elastic and there is considerably less sonic detail\". But also praised the album by stating \"Though the music isn't original, and the lyrics break no new territory, the execution is strong -- Snoop's rapping and rhyming continue to improve, while the bass-heavy funk is often intoxicating.\" He ended the review stating \"...the album is a fine follow-up to one of the most successful hip-hop albums in history.\"<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\n===Commercial reception===\nBefore the release of the album many were questioning if the album would become lost in the turmoil and tragedy of the label, or even to be bypassed in the rush of Tupac's [[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory|posthumous album]]. However retailers thought differently such as Violet Brown, urban music buyer for the Wherehouse music chain. \"Customer anticipation has been huge. As soon as record executives found out they were opening against Snoop [this week], they shifted the release dates of some rival rap albums to avoid the Snoop sales rush.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-11/entertainment/ca-63540_1_executive-vice-president& | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Ready, Set . . .

While falling short of Doggystyle's 803,000 in the first week sold (the record at the time for a rap album), the album still was the third-highest rap debut of that year behind Shakur's \"[[All Eyez on Me]]\" (566,000 first-week copies) and \"Killuminati\" (664,000 copies), and it ranks fourth overall on the year's list of top debuts, which is headed by [[Metallica]]'s \"Load\" (680,000 copies).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-21/entertainment/ca-1151_1_tupac-shakur& | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Shauna | last=Snow | title=Arts and entertainment reports from The Times, national and international news services and the nation's press | date=November 21, 1996}}</ref> The album has sold over two million copies in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA104&dq=death+row+soundscan&hl=en&ei=VZ9NTqu8KefkiAKP1pVw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=death%20row%20soundscan&f=false& |title=Knight Moves |date=October 2001 |magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |page=104 |location=New York |publisher=InterMedia Partners |issn=1070-4701 |accessdate={{date|2011-10-01|mdy}}}}</ref>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{tracklist\n| total_length = \n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| title1  = Intro\n| note1 = \n| writer1 = \n| extra1 = \n| length1 = 0:46\n\n| title2  = [[Doggfather]]\n| note2 = featuring [[Charlie Wilson (musician)|Charlie Wilson]]\n| writer2 = [[Snoop Dogg|Calvin Broadus, Jr.]], [[Daz Dillinger|Delmar Arnaud]]\n| extra2 = [[Daz Dillinger|Dat Nigga Daz]]\n| length2 = 3:57\n\n| title3 = Ride 4 Me\n| note3 = \n| writer3 = Broadus, Jr., Ralph Aiken, Tyrone Crum, Keith Harrison, Robert Neal, Jr., Roger Parker, Clarence Satchell\n| extra3 = \n| length3 = 1:01\n\n| title4 = Up Jump tha Boogie\n| note4 = featuring [[Charlie Wilson (musician)|Charlie Wilson]] and [[Kurupt|Kurupt tha Kingpin]] \n| writer4 = Broadus, Jr., [[Kurupt|Ricardo Brown]], [[DJ Pooh|Mark Jordan]]\n| extra4 = [[DJ Pooh]]\n| length4 = 4:43\n\n| title5  = Freestyle Conversation\n| note5 = \n| writer5 = Broadus, Jr., [[Soopafly|Priest Brooks]]\n| extra5 = [[Soopafly]]\n| length5 = 4:17\n\n| title6  = When I Grow Up\n| note6 = \n| writer6 = Broadus, Jr.\n| extra6 = \n| length6 = 0:37\n\n| title7  = Snoop Bounce\n| note7 = featuring Charlie Wilson\n| writer7 = Broadus, Jr., Jordan, [[Roger Troutman]]\n| extra7 = DJ Pooh\n| length7  = 4:03\n\n| title8 = Gold Rush\n| note8 = featuring Kurupt tha Kingpin and [[LBC Crew]]\n| writer8 = Broadus, Jr., Brown, [[Bad Azz (rapper)|Jamarr Stamps]], David Williams, Reggie Vanterpool, Ralph Wheeler\n| extra8 = Arkim & Flair\n| length8 = 4:52\n\n| title9 = (Tear 'Em Off) Me and My Doggz\n| note9 = \n| writer9 = Broadus, Jr., D.

It was released on November 12, 1996, by [[Death Row Records]] and [[Interscope Records]]. After the success of his debut album ''[[Doggystyle]]'' (1993), Snoop was charged with murder and in 1995, spent time preparing for the case that went to trial. In February 1996, he was cleared of all charges and began working on his second album without [[Dr. Dre]] providing work as a [[record producer]]. This was Snoop's final album on Death Row Records under his name of ''Snoop Doggy Dogg''. Recording sessions took place from February 1996 to October 1996, with [[Suge Knight]] filling in as the [[Executive producer#Music|executive producer]] on the album, alongside the additional production from several [[record producer]]s such as [[DJ Pooh]], [[Daz Dillinger]], [[Soopafly]] and [[L.T. Hutton]]; as well as [[guest appearance]]s from [[Charlie Wilson (musician)|Charlie Wilson]], [[Kurupt|Kurupt tha Kingpin]], [[Tray Dee]] and [[Warren G]], among others.\n\nThe album debuted at number one during the week of November 12, 1996, selling over 420,000 copies, but it failed to match the commercial success of ''Doggystyle''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22&dq=snoop+dogg+bubbling+under&hl=pt-BR&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwilscbQ97XNAhXFh5AKHQIPAaIQ6AEIJzAB#v=onepage&q=snoop%20dogg%20bubbling%20under&f=false |title=Billboard magazine - August 22, 1998 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=June 20, 2016}}</ref> [[Dr. Dre]] had left Death Row to his partner [[Suge Knight]], who was indicted for racketeering by the end of 1996. ''Tha Doggfather'' was also released only one week after another Death Row release, the first posthumous album by [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]], ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]'', which debuted at number one. Consequently, Snoop's second album stalled at sales of two million copies.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1992, Snoop Dogg featured on the album ''[[The Chronic]]'' by close friend Dr. Dre, which was a great success.\n\nIn 1993, Snoop and Dr. Dre began work on ''Doggystyle'' which was also very popular and acclaimed. During the recording of ''Doggystyle'' Snoop became a defendant in a murder case which saw his acquittal shortly before this album was released, which led him to no longer live the \"gangsta\" lifestyle he portrayed in his records.\n\nDr. Dre, who was Death Row Records' in-house producer, had left earlier in 1996 to start [[Aftermath Entertainment|his own label]], which led Snoop's first cousin Daz Dillinger to become Death Row's head producer; he worked on this record. The [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|murder of Snoop's close friend and fellow rapper, label-mate Tupac Shakur]] in September 1996 also weighed on him heavily; Shakur appears on the closing track \"Outro\", under the name \"Makaveli\", which he began using a short while before his death. \n\n==Release==\n''Tha Doggfather'' charted at number one on both the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] charts. To date, the album sold two million copies in the United States and sold better internationally than its predecessor, \"Doggystyle\" (1993).\n\n==Music==\n\n===Production===\nDuring the departure of Dr. Dre from Death Row Records, the majority of this album was produced and mixed by [[DJ Pooh]]. In addition to DJ Pooh, Daz Dillinger and several other producers contributed to this album. In 1996, in an interview with [[Rap City (BET program)|Rap City]], Snoop Dogg revealed that he had been working with Dr. Dre for this album; however, he had been prevented from doing so by Suge Knight. The album samples songs such as \"It's Like That\" performed by [[Run-D.M.C.]], \"[[Vapors (song)|Vapors]]\" performed by [[Biz Markie]], \"More Bounce to the Ounce\" performed by [[Zapp & Roger]], and \"[[Oops Upside Your Head]]\" performed by [[The Gap Band]]. The Doggfather also marked the debut of Snoop Dogg as a [[record producer]] on the track \"(O.J.) Wake Up\". Snoop Dogg also was beginning to be acknowledged on how to play [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] by a high-profile producer named [[L.T. Hutton]], who led a hand providing some production on that track as well.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asSDVUq8HaY |title=Snoop Dogg Rap City Interview (Part 2) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref>\n\nThe illustration on the back cover of the CD was done by Joe Cool, the same artist who did the front cover of Snoop's previous album ''Doggystyle''.\n\n===Lyrics===\nCompared to Doggystyle, the lyrics are much less violent and controversial. On ''Tha Doggfather'', Snoop Dogg wanted to present a more positive image in his lyrics, a reflection of his maturation as an artist and as a new father.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er-CVjntHlA |title=Snoop Dogg Rap City Interview (Part 1) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> On December 3, 2006, in an interview with [[Vh1]], Snoop Dogg revealed the differences between ''Doggystyle'' and ''Tha Doggfather'', stating, \"I think ''Tha Doggfather'' was a rebirth of me, as far as me being more positive on what I was tryin' to say and, you know, tryin' to live the life through my music, instead of me just livin' my life, tryin' to show people that my life... wasn't like my music...I'm not gonna glorify none of this negativity that Death Row wanted me to do. I'm gonna bring a positive side of music.\" Although his new lyrical direction was met with mixed feelings from fans and critics alike, Snoop Dogg still thinks of the album as a success: \"I enjoyed it and everywhere I go around the world people, you know, I sign more Doggfather records than any other record I put out. That's the one I sign the most and I'm proud at the thang I did and the thang is... sometimes you can outgrow your fans\".<ref>{{cite video |url=http://www.vh1.com/video/misc/122939/on-the-doggfather.jhtml#artist=1133 |title=On \"Tha Doggfather\" by Snoop Dogg |publisher=[[VH1]] |accessdate={{date|2011-10-01|mdy}}}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical reaction ===\n{{Album reviews\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]] \n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r244077|tab=review |label=\"Snoop Dogg: ''Tha Doggfather'' |first=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |accessdate={{date|2011-10-01|mdy}}}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n|rev2Score = B+<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,295271,00.html |title=Music Review: 'Tha Doggfather' (1996) |first=J.D. |last=Considine |authorlink=J.D.

In a February issue of [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] magazine, Dr. Dre stated his feelings on the album and said \"But to be perfectly honest, I don't like Snoop's new album. And it has nothing to do with me not working him, because I'm just like everybody else: I like it, or I don't. The first time I heard the single, I was grooving to it, but then I really started to get into the production and how it was sounding, you know? The first time you hear some shit, you just listen to it to get your groove on, but after that, I start breaking songs down. There's really nothing that was said on there that hasn't been said 50 times before.\"<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wF1pZCI8MZYC&pg=PA50&dq=snoop+dogg+tha+doggfather&hl=en&ei=bTf1TZKNFpGosAOHr7W2Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CE4Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q=snoop%20dogg%20tha%20doggfather&f=false& |title=Trouble Funk |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |page=50 |date=February 1997 |issn=0886-3032}}</ref>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the album stating that \"Even without Dr. Dre behind the board, Snoop and his studio team concoct an intoxicating blend of old-school funk and gangsta cool\", but also noted that \"There's not much to love in the album's attitude toward sex, drugs, and first-degree murder.\" [[Muzik]] said, \"...a more angular, spiky, old school-influenced vehicle for the Dogg Father to strut his matter-of-act rhymes over... you [are taken in] by the strength of the rhyming...\". [[Melody Maker]] ranked it #49 on Melody Maker's list of 1996's 'Albums Of The Year'. The [[Los Angeles Times]] reported that \"Snoop still is one of rap's most electrifying performers. But unlike \"[[Doggystyle]]\" and the \"[[Murder Was the Case]]\" soundtrack, few of the beats on this album rival his rapping prowess.\" They complimented some of the tracks, calling 'Doggfather' \"... the epitome of cool smoothness. Over a slow-rolling Daz and DJ Pooh track\" 'Freestyle Conversation' \"...an Outkast-style exercise in which Snoop speaks a mile a minute, but still manages to maintain a funky rhythm\", 'Gold Rush' a \"funky pistolero track\" and the [[Biz Markie]] remake '[[Vapors (song)|Vapors]]' \"the album's real gem\". The review went on to conclude that \"Tha Doggfather may not be Doggystyle, but Snoop shows that he has the prowess and the talent to survive.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-10/entertainment/ca-63105_1_tha-doggfather& | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Snoop Still Has Some Bite | date=November 10, 1996}}</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' predicted that the album would chart in the top ten due to his presence in the music industry. They also stated that \"The album has a few obligatory mentions of sexual exploits and gun-toting, usually delegated to guest rappers. But most of the raps are about his position as a hit-maker. He still has one of the most distinctive deliveries in rap: a casual, nasal, conversational tone that sounds leisurely even when he's barreling forward. His producers are a little less slick than Dr. Dre was, but they have supplied swampy bass riffs and catchy backup choruses, drawing heavily (like Dr. Dre) on George Clinton's P-Funk. Snoop Doggy Dogg insists, and ''Tha Doggfather'' does that, maintaining a party atmosphere. Yet while it insists that gangsta rap isn't dead, it plays down tough-guy tales in favor of a star's pronouncements.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/26/arts/machismo-in-rap-atop-the-charts.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jon | last=Pareles | title=Machismo In Rap Atop The Charts | date=November 26, 1996}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that the album runs on too long at over 70 minutes and \"Though it works the same G-funk territory, the bass is less elastic and there is considerably less sonic detail\". But also praised the album by stating \"Though the music isn't original, and the lyrics break no new territory, the execution is strong -- Snoop's rapping and rhyming continue to improve, while the bass-heavy funk is often intoxicating.\" He ended the review stating \"...the album is a fine follow-up to one of the most successful hip-hop albums in history.\"<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\n===Commercial reception===\nBefore the release of the album many were questioning if the album would become lost in the turmoil and tragedy of the label, or even to be bypassed in the rush of Tupac's [[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory|posthumous album]]. However retailers thought differently such as Violet Brown, urban music buyer for the Wherehouse music chain. \"Customer anticipation has been huge. As soon as record executives found out they were opening against Snoop [this week], they shifted the release dates of some rival rap albums to avoid the Snoop sales rush.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-11/entertainment/ca-63540_1_executive-vice-president& | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Ready, Set . . .

Which kind of behaviour is followed depends principally on the angle at impact and the velocity range within which the projectile impinges, the density of the projectile and that of the target, and the mechanical properties of both bodies. \u2026 ''Bouncing'' describes rebound due to elastic restitution in either or both of a projectile or target material. In ''ricochet'' the projectile usually undergoes little or no permanent deformation but the target is ploughed. Rebound or ricochet is essentially due to the dynamic pressure of the target material acting upwards on the projectile to overcome its gravitational weight. The mechanisms of elastic restitution and dynamic pressure are of different kinds.

Bouncing it across the surface would allow it to be aimed directly at its target, while avoiding underwater defences, as well as some above the surface, and such a weapon would take advantage of the \"bubble pulse\" effect typical of [[underwater explosion]]s, greatly increasing its effectiveness: Wallis's paper identified suitable targets as [[Hydroelectricity|hydro-electric dams]] \"and floating vessels moored in calm waters such as the Norwegian [[fjord]]s\".<ref>Sweetman (2002), (Part 1), pp. 107, 113.</ref>\n\nBoth types of target were already of great interest to the British military when Wallis wrote his paper (which itself was not his first on the subject); German hydro-electric dams had been identified as important bombing targets before the outbreak of [[World War II]], but existing bombs and bombing methods had little effect on them, as [[torpedo net]]s protected them from attack by conventional [[torpedo]]es and a practical means of destroying them had yet to be devised. In 1942, the British were seeking a means of destroying the German [[battleship]] {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}, which posed a threat to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] shipping in the North Atlantic and had already survived a number of British attempts to destroy it.

Collins was among a large number of other people besides Barnes Wallis who made wide-ranging contributions to the development of a bouncing bomb and its method of delivery to a target, to the extent that, in a paper published in 1982, Collins himself made it evident that Wallis \"did not play ''an all-important'' role in the development of this project and in particular, that very significant contributions were made by, for example, Sir [[William Glanville]], Dr. G. Charlesworth, Dr. A.R. Collins and others of the Road Research Laboratory\".<ref>Quotation from Johnson (1998), pp. 29\u201331, citing Collins, A.R., \"The origins and design of the attack on the German dams\", in ''Proceedings \u2013 Institution of Civil Engineers.

Research and theory'', 73, 1982.</ref> However, the modification of a [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber, the design of which Wallis himself had contributed to, for work in early testing of his proposed weapon, has been cited as an example of how Wallis \"would have been the first to acknowledge\" the contributions of others.<ref>Flower (2002), p. 19.</ref> Also, in the words of Eric Allwright, who worked in the Drawing Office for [[Vickers Armstrongs]] at the time, \"Wallis was trying to do his ordinary job [for Vickers Armstrongs] as well as all this \u2013 he was out at the [[Minister of Aircraft Production|Ministry]] and down to [[Fort Halstead]] and everywhere\"; Wallis's pressing of his papers, ideas and ongoing developments on relevant authorities helped ensure that development continued; Wallis was principal designer of the models, prototypes and \"live\" versions of the weapon; and, perhaps most significantly, it was Wallis who explained the weapon in the final briefing for [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] crews before they set off on [[Operation Chastise]], to use one of his designs in action.<ref>Flower (2002), e.g. pp. 30, 42, and Sweetman (2002), (Parts 1 & 2).</ref>\n\nA distinctive feature of the weapon, added in the course of development, was back-spin, which improved the height and stability of its flight and its ability to bounce, and helped the weapon to remain in contact with, or at least close proximity to, its target on arrival.{{refn|Sources vary on the introduction of back-spin in the weapon's development: e.g while Sweetman (2002), (Part 1), p. 108 says that \"There is evidence that [Wallis] had always intended [to include back-spin]\", according to Johnson (1998), p. 28, \"[[George Edwards (aviation)|Sir George Edwards]], formerly chairman of [[British Aircraft Corporation]], in the Christopher Hinton Lecture of 1982, p. 9, wrote, \"from what I knew of a cricket ball I persuaded [Wallis] much against his will into putting back-spin on these bombs.'\" See also 'Lives Remembered' (Sir George Edwards), in ''[[The Times]]'', 21 March 2003. For the effects of back-spin, see e.g. [[Magnus effect]], [[Backspin]], Flower (2002), pp. 17\u201318, Johnson (1998), pp. 28\u201319, and Sweetman (2002), (Part 1), pp. 108, 116.

This naval aspect was later to be pressed by a [[Minutes|minute]] issued by British prime minister [[Winston Churchill]], in February 1943, asking \"Have you given up all plans for doing anything to {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} while she is in [[Trondheimsfjord|Trondheim]]? ... It is a terrible thing that this prize should be waiting and no one be able to think of a way of winning it.\"<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 106.</ref> However, Highball was ultimately developed as an RAF weapon for use against various targets, including ''Tirpitz''.\n\nFrom November 1942, development and testing for Highball continued alongside that of Upkeep, including the dropping of prototypes at both Chesil Beach and Reculver. While early prototypes dropped at Chesil Beach in December 1942 were forerunners for both versions of the bomb, those dropped at Chesil Beach in January and February 1943 and at Reculver in April 1943 included Highball prototypes.<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 1, pp. 112, 118.</ref> They were dropped by the modified Wellington bomber and at Reculver by a modified [[de Havilland Mosquito|de Havilland Mosquito B Mk IV]], one of two assigned to Vickers Armstrong for the purpose.<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 1, pp. 114, 118.</ref> By early February 1943, Wallis envisaged Highball as \"comprising a {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} charge in a cylinder contained in a {{convert|35|in|cm|abbr=on}} sphere with (an overall weight) of {{convert|950|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\", and a modified Mosquito could carry two such weapons.<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 113.</ref>\n\n[[File:Highball Bouncing Bomb at Abbotsbury Swannery Dorset UK.JPG|thumb|''Highball'' bouncing bomb prototype, now on display at Abbotsbury Swannery]]\nIn tests at Reculver in the middle of April 1943, it was found that Highball's spherical casing suffered similar damage to that of Upkeep. A prototype with an altered design of casing strengthened by steel plate, but empty of inert filling or explosive, was dropped on 30 April and emerged \"quite undamaged\".<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 118.</ref> In further testing on 2 May, two examples of this prototype with inert filling, bounced across the surface of the water as intended, though both were found to be dented.<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 119.</ref>\n\nFurther testing was carried out by three modified Mosquitoes flying from [[RAF Turnberry]], north of [[Girvan]], on the west coast of Scotland, against a target ship, the former French battleship {{ship|French battleship|Courbet|1911|2}}, which had been moored for the purpose in [[Loch Striven]].<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 2, p. 52. RAF Turnberry occupied the site of [[Turnberry (golf course)|Turnberry golf resort]].</ref> This series of tests, on 9 and 10 May, was hampered by a number of errors: [[buoy]]s intended to mark a point {{convert|1200|yd|m|0}} from ''Courbet'', where the prototypes were to be dropped, were found to be too close to the ship by {{convert|400|yd|m|0}}, and, according to Wallis, other errors were due to \"Variations in dimensions of [prototypes] after filling and [dimensionally incorrect] jigs for setting up the [caliper] arms\".<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 2, pp. 52\u201353.</ref> Because of these errors, the prototypes hit the target too fast and too hard, and two aircraft failed to release their prototypes, one of which then fell off while the aircraft was turning for a second attempt.\n\nIt was under such circumstances that Upkeep came to be deployed independently of Highball. In addition to continuing problems in testing Highball, it had been observed at the end of March 1943 that \"At best [aircrews] would need two months' special training\".<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 115.</ref> With this in mind, [[No. 618 Squadron RAF|618 Squadron]] had been formed on 1 April 1943 at [[RAF Skitten]], near [[Wick, Highland|Wick]], in northeastern Scotland, to undertake \"Operation Servant\", in which ''Tirpitz'' would be attacked with Highball bouncing bombs.<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 2, pp. 48\u201349.</ref> On 18 April it was recommended that Operation Servant should be undertaken before the end of June, since 618 Squadron could not be held back for this purpose indefinitely. It was not until early September 1943 that, in view of continuing problems with both Highball and its release mechanism, most of 618 Squadron was \"released for other duties\". This in practice meant the abandonment of Operation Servant.<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 2, pp. 54, 57.</ref> Core personnel of 618 Squadron were retained and these continued work on the development of Highball.<ref>Flower (2002), p. 78.</ref>\n\nTesting between 15 and 17 May 1944 showed progress with Highball. By this time ''Courbet'' had been designated for use as a [[Mulberry harbour#Gooseberry|Gooseberry breakwater]] for the [[invasion of Normandy]], so the old battleship {{HMS|Malaya}}, then in reserve, was used instead (also moored in Loch Striven). With crew on board ''Malaya'', bombers dropped inert Highball prototypes fitted with hydrostatic pistols, aiming at the ship. They struck the ship, and at least two punched a hole in the ship's side. On 17 May, for the first time, Highball prototypes were released in pairs, only one second apart.<ref>Flower (2002), pp. 78\u201379.</ref>\n\nBy the end of May 1944, problems with releasing Highball had been resolved as had problems with aiming. Aiming Highball required a different method from Upkeep; the problem was solved by Wallis's design of a ring aperture sight fixed to a flying helmet.<ref>Flower (2002), pp. 78\u201380.</ref> Highball was now a sphere with flattened [[wikt:pole#Noun 2|pole]]s and the explosive charge was Torpex, enclosed in a cylinder, as in Upkeep; detonation was by a single hydrostatic pistol, set to fire at a depth of {{convert|27|ft|m|0}}, and its weight was {{convert|1280|lb|kg|0}}, of which {{convert|600|lb|kg|0}} was Torpex.\n\nHighball was never used operationally: on 12 November 1944, in [[Operation Catechism]],  Lancasters with [[Tallboy bomb]]s sank its primary target, ''Tirpitz''. Other potential targets had been considered during Highball's development and later. These included the ships of the [[Regia Marina|Italian navy]], canals, dry docks, [[submarine pen]]s, and railway tunnels (for which testing took place in 1943). But Italy surrendered in September 1943, and the other target ideas were dismissed as impracticable.<ref>Flower (2002), e.g. pp. 66\u201367, 72\u201376.

After brief flight testing in the UK, the kit was sent to [[Wright Field]], Ohio and installed in an A-26C Invader. Twenty-five inert Highballs, renamed \"Speedee\" bombs, were also sent for use in the USAAF trials. Drop tests were carried out over [[Choctawhatchee Bay]] near [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin Field]], Florida but the programme was abandoned, after the bomb bounced back at A-26C-25-DT Invader ''43-22644'' on Water Range 60, causing loss of the rear fuselage and a [[List of accidents and incidents involving military aircraft (1945\u20131949)#1945|fatal crash on 28 April 1945]].<ref>Flower (2002), pp. 87\u201388.

Which kind of behaviour is followed depends principally on the angle at impact and the velocity range within which the projectile impinges, the density of the projectile and that of the target, and the mechanical properties of both bodies. \u2026 ''Bouncing'' describes rebound due to elastic restitution in either or both of a projectile or target material. In ''ricochet'' the projectile usually undergoes little or no permanent deformation but the target is ploughed. Rebound or ricochet is essentially due to the dynamic pressure of the target material acting upwards on the projectile to overcome its gravitational weight. The mechanisms of elastic restitution and dynamic pressure are of different kinds.

By the time the war ended, the remaining operational Upkeep bombs had started to deteriorate and were dumped into the [[North Sea]] without their detonation devices.<ref>Flower (2002), p. 62, and Robert Owen, \"Operation Guzzle\", in ''Breaching the German Dams Flying Into History'', RAF Museum, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Highball===<!--this section linked from [[Skip bombing]]-->\nIn April 1942, Wallis himself had described his proposed weapon as \"essentially a weapon for the [[Fleet Air Arm]]\". This naval aspect was later to be pressed by a [[Minutes|minute]] issued by British prime minister [[Winston Churchill]], in February 1943, asking \"Have you given up all plans for doing anything to {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} while she is in [[Trondheimsfjord|Trondheim]]? ... It is a terrible thing that this prize should be waiting and no one be able to think of a way of winning it.\"<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 106.</ref> However, Highball was ultimately developed as an RAF weapon for use against various targets, including ''Tirpitz''.\n\nFrom November 1942, development and testing for Highball continued alongside that of Upkeep, including the dropping of prototypes at both Chesil Beach and Reculver. While early prototypes dropped at Chesil Beach in December 1942 were forerunners for both versions of the bomb, those dropped at Chesil Beach in January and February 1943 and at Reculver in April 1943 included Highball prototypes.<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 1, pp. 112, 118.</ref> They were dropped by the modified Wellington bomber and at Reculver by a modified [[de Havilland Mosquito|de Havilland Mosquito B Mk IV]], one of two assigned to Vickers Armstrong for the purpose.<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 1, pp. 114, 118.</ref> By early February 1943, Wallis envisaged Highball as \"comprising a {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} charge in a cylinder contained in a {{convert|35|in|cm|abbr=on}} sphere with (an overall weight) of {{convert|950|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\", and a modified Mosquito could carry two such weapons.<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 113.</ref>\n\n[[File:Highball Bouncing Bomb at Abbotsbury Swannery Dorset UK.JPG|thumb|''Highball'' bouncing bomb prototype, now on display at Abbotsbury Swannery]]\nIn tests at Reculver in the middle of April 1943, it was found that Highball's spherical casing suffered similar damage to that of Upkeep. A prototype with an altered design of casing strengthened by steel plate, but empty of inert filling or explosive, was dropped on 30 April and emerged \"quite undamaged\".<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 118.</ref> In further testing on 2 May, two examples of this prototype with inert filling, bounced across the surface of the water as intended, though both were found to be dented.<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 119.</ref>\n\nFurther testing was carried out by three modified Mosquitoes flying from [[RAF Turnberry]], north of [[Girvan]], on the west coast of Scotland, against a target ship, the former French battleship {{ship|French battleship|Courbet|1911|2}}, which had been moored for the purpose in [[Loch Striven]].<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 2, p. 52. RAF Turnberry occupied the site of [[Turnberry (golf course)|Turnberry golf resort]].</ref> This series of tests, on 9 and 10 May, was hampered by a number of errors: [[buoy]]s intended to mark a point {{convert|1200|yd|m|0}} from ''Courbet'', where the prototypes were to be dropped, were found to be too close to the ship by {{convert|400|yd|m|0}}, and, according to Wallis, other errors were due to \"Variations in dimensions of [prototypes] after filling and [dimensionally incorrect] jigs for setting up the [caliper] arms\".<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 2, pp. 52\u201353.</ref> Because of these errors, the prototypes hit the target too fast and too hard, and two aircraft failed to release their prototypes, one of which then fell off while the aircraft was turning for a second attempt.\n\nIt was under such circumstances that Upkeep came to be deployed independently of Highball. In addition to continuing problems in testing Highball, it had been observed at the end of March 1943 that \"At best [aircrews] would need two months' special training\".<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 1, p. 115.</ref> With this in mind, [[No. 618 Squadron RAF|618 Squadron]] had been formed on 1 April 1943 at [[RAF Skitten]], near [[Wick, Highland|Wick]], in northeastern Scotland, to undertake \"Operation Servant\", in which ''Tirpitz'' would be attacked with Highball bouncing bombs.<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 2, pp. 48\u201349.</ref> On 18 April it was recommended that Operation Servant should be undertaken before the end of June, since 618 Squadron could not be held back for this purpose indefinitely. It was not until early September 1943 that, in view of continuing problems with both Highball and its release mechanism, most of 618 Squadron was \"released for other duties\". This in practice meant the abandonment of Operation Servant.<ref>Sweetman (2002), Part 2, pp. 54, 57.</ref> Core personnel of 618 Squadron were retained and these continued work on the development of Highball.<ref>Flower (2002), p. 78.</ref>\n\nTesting between 15 and 17 May 1944 showed progress with Highball. By this time ''Courbet'' had been designated for use as a [[Mulberry harbour#Gooseberry|Gooseberry breakwater]] for the [[invasion of Normandy]], so the old battleship {{HMS|Malaya}}, then in reserve, was used instead (also moored in Loch Striven). With crew on board ''Malaya'', bombers dropped inert Highball prototypes fitted with hydrostatic pistols, aiming at the ship. They struck the ship, and at least two punched a hole in the ship's side. On 17 May, for the first time, Highball prototypes were released in pairs, only one second apart.<ref>Flower (2002), pp. 78\u201379.</ref>\n\nBy the end of May 1944, problems with releasing Highball had been resolved as had problems with aiming. Aiming Highball required a different method from Upkeep; the problem was solved by Wallis's design of a ring aperture sight fixed to a flying helmet.<ref>Flower (2002), pp. 78\u201380.</ref> Highball was now a sphere with flattened [[wikt:pole#Noun 2|pole]]s and the explosive charge was Torpex, enclosed in a cylinder, as in Upkeep; detonation was by a single hydrostatic pistol, set to fire at a depth of {{convert|27|ft|m|0}}, and its weight was {{convert|1280|lb|kg|0}}, of which {{convert|600|lb|kg|0}} was Torpex.\n\nHighball was never used operationally: on 12 November 1944, in [[Operation Catechism]],  Lancasters with [[Tallboy bomb]]s sank its primary target, ''Tirpitz''. Other potential targets had been considered during Highball's development and later. These included the ships of the [[Regia Marina|Italian navy]], canals, dry docks, [[submarine pen]]s, and railway tunnels (for which testing took place in 1943). But Italy surrendered in September 1943, and the other target ideas were dismissed as impracticable.<ref>Flower (2002), e.g. pp. 66\u201367, 72\u201376. On 3 September 1943, an [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|armistice]] was signed between Italy and the Allies.</ref>\n\nIn January 1945, at the Vickers experimental facility at [[Cobham Bus Museum|Foxwarren]], near [[Cobham, Surrey]], a Douglas [[A-26 Invader]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] was adapted to carry two Highballs almost completely enclosed in the bomb bay, using parts from a Mosquito conversion. After brief flight testing in the UK, the kit was sent to [[Wright Field]], Ohio and installed in an A-26C Invader. Twenty-five inert Highballs, renamed \"Speedee\" bombs, were also sent for use in the USAAF trials. Drop tests were carried out over [[Choctawhatchee Bay]] near [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin Field]], Florida but the programme was abandoned, after the bomb bounced back at A-26C-25-DT Invader ''43-22644'' on Water Range 60, causing loss of the rear fuselage and a [[List of accidents and incidents involving military aircraft (1945\u20131949)#1945|fatal crash on 28 April 1945]].<ref>Flower (2002), pp. 87\u201388.

The importance of back-spin was not understood and trials by a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] proved to be dangerous to the aircraft as the bomb matched the speed at which it was dropped. Attempts to rectify this with booster rockets failed and the project was cancelled in 1944.<ref>Flower (2002), p. 62, Sweetman (1999). Soviet forces are reputed to have used two bouncing bombs during the attack that sank the World War II [[German anti-aircraft cruiser Niobe]] in [[Kotka]], Finland on 16 July 1944;{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} but no development details are known for this device and it may have been a [[skip bombing]] incident.</ref>\n\n==Re-creating the bouncing bomb==\nIn 2011, a project was initiated to re-create a [[Operation Chastise|Dambusters]] raid. [[Buffalo Airways]] was selected as the company to fly the mission, with their own plane and pilots. Buffalo would drop a re-created 'Upkeep' bouncing bomb from their [[DC-4]]. The project was documented in the documentary television show ''[[Dambusters Fly Again]]'' in Canada and Australia, ''[[Dambusters: Building the Bouncing Bomb]]'' in the UK, and the [[Nova (American TV series)|Nova]] episode [[Bombing Hitler's Dams]] in the US. It involved dropping a replica dummy bomb, which performed as intended striking a replica dam which had been specially constructed; this was subsequently destroyed by a charge placed where the bomb had landed.<ref name=DBFA-HTca>History Television, [http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=261043 Dambusters Fly Again] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319220020/http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=261043 |date=19 March 2012 }} (accessed 2011 August)</ref><ref name=Telegraph-2011-05-02>The Telegraph (London), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8478469/The-day-the-Dam-Busters-returned...-in-Canada.html \"The day the Dam Busters returned... in Canada\"], Tom Chivers, 2 May 2011 (accessed 2011 August)</ref><ref name=EAA-2011-05-05>EAA, [http://www.eaa.org/news/2011/2011-05-05_dambusters.asp \"'Ice Pilots' Help Re-Create 'Dambusters'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330063638/http://www.eaa.org/news/2011/2011-05-05_dambusters.asp |date=30 March 2012 }}, Hal Bryan, 5 May 2011 (accessed 2011 August)</ref><ref name=Ch4-DBTBB>Channel 4, [http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dambusters-building-the-bouncing-bomb/episode-guide/series-1/episode-1 \"Dambusters: Building the Bouncing Bomb\"] (accessed 2011 August)</ref><ref name=Nova-BHD>PBS, WGBH, Nova, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/military/bombing-hitler-dams.html \"Bombing Hitler's Dams\"].
