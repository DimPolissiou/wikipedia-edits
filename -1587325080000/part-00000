January 1508) was a Scottish knight, [[armiger]], and Governor of the Castle at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]]. He was also a member of the old Scottish Parliament.<ref>Young, James, ''Historical References to the Scottish Family of Lauder'' (Glasgow, 1884), p. 90</ref> The Lauders held the feudal barony of [[The Bass]] (the caput of which was its castle), [[East Lothian]], [[Edrington Castle]] and lands in the parish of [[Mordington]], Berwickshire, [[Tyninghame]] in Haddingtonshire, and numerous other estates and properties elsewhere in [[Scotland]].\n\n== Robert of Edrington ==\n\nLauder was the eldest son and heir of Robert Lauder of the Bass (d.1495) by his first spouse Jonet,<ref>''The Great Seal of Scotland'', 1471: 1045</ref> daughter of [[Alexander Home, 1st Lord Home|Sir Alexander Home]]<ref>Dunlop, A.I., MacLauchlan, David, Cowan, Ian, editors, ''Calendar of Scottish Supplications to Rome 1433\u20131447'', vol. 4 (Glasgow Press, 1983), no. 885: 219</ref>\n\nPrior to his father's death, Lauder was usually designated \"of [[Edrington]]\" in Berwickshire.<ref>''The Great Seal of Scotland'', 25 April 1450: 343</ref> After his purchase of the lands of [[Biel, East Lothian|Biell]], in East Lothian he was designated 'of Biel'.\n\nIn 1462 [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] was recovered by the Scots and Lauder was put in charge of [[Berwick Castle]], until he was succeeded in 1474 by [[David Lindsay, 1st Duke of Montrose|David, Earl of Crawford]]. In 1464 Lauder was paid \u00a320 for repairs to the castle.<ref>Scott, John, ''Berwick-upon-Tweed, The History of the Town and Guild'', London, 1888</ref>\n\nA notorial instrument dated 13 May 1465 narrates:<blockquote>[this] Robert Lauder, son and apparent heir of Sir Robert Lauder of Edrington, asserted that David Lauder of Popil ([[East Lothian]]) had given sasine and heritable possession to his eldest son James Lauder and Jonete his spouse, their heirs etc., of a certain piece of land at Popil, to the prejudice of the first-mentioned Robert, who solemnly protested that the said sasine should neither be valid nor prejudice his right in the land, and for greater security, he, by throwing of earth and stone outside the house belonging to the piece of land, and by breaking a plate with his foot, broke and annulled the said sasine and so possession by James Lauder and his wife. Done at Popil at 7 a.m. on 13th May 1465 before Henry Ogil of Popil, James Ogil his eldest son, and others.</blockquote>\n\n\"Robert de Laweder de Edryngtoun\" is the first witness to a Retour of Service, dated 7 April 1467, of Margaret Sinclair as one of the heirs of her grandfather John Sinclair in the lands of Kimmerghame, Berwickshire.<ref>Historic Manuscripts Commission, ''Manuscripts of Colonel David Milne-Home of Wedderburn Castle, N.B.'', London, 1902: 258</ref> Although he was not yet in formal possession of the Edrington estate (see next entry below) he appears to be regularly using the designation, as eldest son, 'of Edrington'.\n\n==Invested in Edrington==\n\nIn a charter of 1471, [[James III of Scotland]] confirmed to Robert Lauder, son and heir apparent of Robert Lauder of Edrington and the Bass, the lands of Edrington and Coalstell with the fishings of Edermouth (or mouth of the [[Whiteadder Water]]) plus the mill there (at Edrington) which Robert the father personally resigned to Robert junior and his male heirs failing which those relations bearing the Lauder arms.<ref>''The Great Seal of Scotland'', 1471: 1045</ref>\n\nIn a further charter signed at [[Edinburgh]] on 26 June 1474 and confirmed there on 27 July 1475, James III confirmed a feu charter of Robert Lauder junior, Lord of Edringtoun, and superior of West Nisbet, to David Creichtoun of Cranstoun and his heirs, of the lands of West Nisbet in the barony of [[Pencaitland]], East Lothian, which John de Colquhoun of Luss has resigned into the said Robert Lauder junior's hands. Witnesses included Robert Lauder of Bass, father of said Robert junior, and a William Lauder.<ref>''The Great Seal'', 1477: 1202/1299</ref>\n\n==Governor of Berwick castle==\n\nKing [[James III of Scotland]] again appointed Robert Lauder of Edrington as custodian and governor of the castle at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] for 5 years, with a retainer of 200 merks per annum.<ref>''The Great Seal of Scotland'', 20 January 1477: 1276</ref>\n\nIn 1477 Robert was one of those entrusted by James III to escort the dowry of Princess [[Cecily of York]] for her planned marriage to [[James IV of Scotland|James, Duke of Rothesay]]. Cecily was the third daughter of [[Edward IV of England]] and [[Elizabeth Woodville]].\n\nBain records that on 2 February 1477: \"James King of Scotland signifies to the bearers of the instalment of the Princess Cecilia's dower due at [[Candlemas]]s, that he has sent Alexander, Lord Hume, Robert of Lawdir of Edrington son and heir apparent to Robert of Lawdir of the Bass, and Adam of Blackadder of that Ilk, with the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], to conduct them to Edinburgh.\"\n\nA charter of 1477 to Alexander Inglis of tenements of land in Hide Hill etc., in [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], lists those who own neighbouring properties, which include \"Robert Lauder of Bass junior\".<ref>''The Great Seal of Scotland'', 3 March 1477: 1281</ref>\n\n===Other mentions===\n\nA Retour of Special Service was held at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] on 20 May 1477 serving Thomas Broun (of lawful age) as son and heir to John Broun (who has been dead three months), in a carucate of land with pertinents on the north side of Flemington, (near [[Eyemouth]], Berwickshire), valued at four merks annually and held in chief of the Laird of [[Restalrig]] [near Edinburgh] and Flemington for service of ward and relief, such services being given as neighbouring tenants in these lands are accustomed to give. Retour given by Henry Congiltoun, Sheriff depute of Berwick. Amongst the jury was Robert Lawder of Edrington, Thomas Edingtoun of that Ilk, Thomas Lumsden of that Ilk, William Douglas, Archibald Manderston, John Skougall and William Lauder.\n\nHe witnessed a charter at the castle of [[Dunbar]] on 18 December 1475 as \"Robert Lauder of Edrington\".<ref>''The Great Seal of Scotland'', 27 July 1479: 1428</ref> On 2 April 1486, a \"Robert Lawedar\" was one of the witnesses to document signed on the High Altar at [[Holyrood Abbey]]. As the leading witness was William Hall, Vicar of [[Bara, East Lothian|Baro]], it is probable that this Robert is of the Bass family. Another witness was an Alexander Home.\n\nIn 1489 [[James IV of Scotland]] granted a charter to Lauder of the lands of Beil, Johnscleuch in the [[Lammermuir Hills]], and \"le Clyntis\", with their towers and mills etc., in the Barony of Dunbar, formerly owned by Hugo de Dunbar & Beil, with the lands and mill of Mersington, Berwickshire, which Hugo de Dunbar of Bele also resigned. The charter mentions Robert's wife Isabel Hay.<ref>''The Great Seal of Scotland'', 12 September 1489: 1894</ref>\n\nThe''[[Exchequer Rolls]]'' record Robert Lauder of Edrington in possession of the lands of Glensax in Yarrow, [[Selkirkshire]] in 1489/1490/1491.\n\n== Papal petition ==\n\nA Petition to [[Pope Innocent VIII]] signed in the presence of Henry Congleton and others in January 1491, craved absolution for numerous people during the 'recent troubles' in Scotland and the [[Battle of Sauchieburn]] (11 June 1488). Lauder was named as son and heir of the Lord of Bass and Baron of [[Stenton]]. Others include Kentigern Hepburn of Waughtoun, Patrick Skowgale, Alexander Sidserf, William Sinclair, David Renton of Billie & [[Lamberton, Berwickshire|Lamberton]], Alexander Home, Archibald Dunbar, William Manderston, Gavin Home, and John Sommerville.<ref>''Historic Manuscripts Commission, Manuscripts of Colonel David Milne Home of Wedderburn Castle'' (London, 1902), 263\u20134.</ref>\n\nOn 4 August 1494 in a court held at Stenton, before John Swinton of that Ilk, depute and lieutenant of John, [[Lord Glamis]], and Robert Lord l'Isle, King's Justiciars generally constituted from the south side of the Forth; Robert Lauder of Bass showed a charter or writ of resignation by the deceased Gilbery Duchry mentioning that Gilbert resigned the land or tenement of Duchry (in the [[Lammermuir Hills]]), in the tenement of Stentoun, in the hands of Walter, Stewart of Scotland, superior thereof. Robert Lauder of Beil, son and apparent heir of the said Robert, asserted that a charter by his father to him of the mains of [[Stenton]] and three-quarters of the town and territory made no reservation of the lands of Duchry. The witnesses were Robert Laweder, son and apparent heir of Robert Lauder of Beill, James Cockburn of [[Clerkington]], William Hepburn of [[Athelstaneford]], Alexander Sydserf of that Ilk, James Ogill, David Ogill, and others.{{cn}}\n\n==Death of father==\n\nRobert Lauder was granted sasine of Stenton, Garvald, and The Bass in 1495,<ref>''Exchequer Rolls''</ref> and the lands of Symprin and Ladypart, near Lauder. This would normally occur upon the death of the head of the family.\n\nA charter registered (but almost certainly signed much earlier) on 1 February 1497 records \"Robert Lauder of Bass and Lord of Auldkathi to Robert Lauder his eldest son and Ysobella [sic] Hay his spouse, and their survivor of them, and their heirs male to be procreated of their bodies, of the lands of Auldkathi lying in the barony of Kynnele ([[Kinnoull]]) and sheriffdom of (Lin)Lithgow. Witnesses were William Hay of Menzen, William Hay of Tallo, Hugh of Dunbar, Gavin Lumsden, Thomas and Peter Wood and James Sinclair.\" The footnote states that the granter's seal is in fair condition.<ref>''Calendar of Writs preserved at Yester House'', Scottish Record Society: 240</ref>\n\n==Visit of James IV==\n\nIn 1497 King James IV visited the Bass\".<ref>John J. Reid, ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries'', 1885.</ref> The boatmen who conveyed him from [[Dunbar]] were paid 14 shillings.<ref>Phillimore, R.P., ''North Berwick, Gullane, Aberlady and East Linton District'' (North Berwick, 1913), p. 50.</ref> Robert was knighted after January 1497 but before July 1498, so probably on the occasion of the King's visit to the Bass.{{cn}}\n\n==Legal transactions==\n\nOn 10 July 1498, he raised an action as assignee to the deceased David Dunbar of Bele [Beil], heir of the deceased Alexander Dunbar of Biel, against Mungo Home, son and heir of the deceased John Home of Whiterig, [[Berwickshire]], and Margaret Hume his mother, for postponing and delaying to resign the 12 merk lands of the west end of Mersington, Berwickshire, with pertinents, \"land on the west half of the burne\" and keeping the charters and muniments thereof. The defenders did not appear. The Lords discern them to conform to the reversion produced, and assign 15 January next to the pursuer to prove the value of damages and violated profits and duties.{{cn}}\n\nIn July 1501 there was a dispute between Jonet, prioress of the Convent of [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]], (represented by David Balfour of Caraldstone) and Robert Lauder of the Bass, knight, regarding the lands and chapellany of [[Garvald, East Lothian|Garvald]], East Lothian, and also damage made to Lauder's house at [[White Castle, East Lothian|Whitecastle]] (or Nunraw) near Haddington.

The team was led by head coach Tony Bennett, in his sixth year, and played their home games at [[John Paul Jones Arena]] as members of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].\n\nBuilding on the success of [[2013\u201314 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|the previous season]], the Cavaliers had their best regular season in program history with a record of 28\u20132, their first undefeated non-conference regular season record since [[2000\u201301 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|2000\u201301]], and their highest national ranking since [[1982\u201383 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|1982\u201383]], ranking at number two on the AP Poll for a total of seven weeks. The Cavaliers also became the first team outside of [[Tobacco Road rivalry|Tobacco Road]] to win back-to-back ACC regular season championships, with their conference record of 16\u20132. Particular highlights included holding Rutgers, Harvard, and Georgia Tech to under thirty points each. Virginia also held Harvard to a single field goal in the first half of their game, tying the NCAA record for fewest field goals allowed in the first half of a game since the [[shot clock]] was instituted in 1986.<ref name=\"harvard_record\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/cavalierinsider/no-virginia-hammers-harvard-in-historic-fashion/article_9f233f4a-8944-11e4-b194-8be8c6067517.html |title=No. 6 Virginia hammers Harvard in historic fashion |first=Whitey |last=Reid |work=[[The Daily Progress]] |date=22 December 2014 |accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"harvard_espn\">{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/101636/the-most-impressive-part-of-uvas-49-point-win |title=Most impressive part of UVa's 49-point win |first=Eammonn |last=Brennan |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=22 December 2014 |accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref> However, late-season injuries, in particular [[Justin Anderson (basketball)|Justin Anderson's]] nearly five-week-long absence due to a broken finger and appendectomy, hurt the team, with the Cavaliers falling in a close loss to North Carolina in the [[2015 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]] semifinals.

They proceeded to win the [[2014 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]] for their second-ever conference championship. The team also tied for the most wins in a season in school history, set a school record for the most single-season conference wins, and earned their highest final national ranking since [[1981\u201382 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|1982]]. The Cavaliers received a #1 seed in the [[2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], where they defeated [[2013\u201314 Coastal Carolina Chanticleers men's basketball team|Coastal Carolina]] and [[2013\u201314 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team|Memphis]] before losing to [[2013\u201314 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]] in the Sweet Sixteen.<ref name=\"lastseason\">{{cite web | title =  Curtain Falls on Extraordinary Basketball Season | url = http://www.virginiasports.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/032914aac.html | website= VirginiaSports.com - The University of Virginia Official Athletic Site | date = 29 March 2014 | accessdate = 8 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Departures===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n!

110th season of play. The team was led by head coach Tony Bennett, in his sixth year, and played their home games at [[John Paul Jones Arena]] as members of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].\n\nBuilding on the success of [[2013\u201314 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|the previous season]], the Cavaliers had their best regular season in program history with a record of 28\u20132, their first undefeated non-conference regular season record since [[2000\u201301 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|2000\u201301]], and their highest national ranking since [[1982\u201383 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|1982\u201383]], ranking at number two on the AP Poll for a total of seven weeks. The Cavaliers also became the first team outside of [[Tobacco Road rivalry|Tobacco Road]] to win back-to-back ACC regular season championships, with their conference record of 16\u20132. Particular highlights included holding Rutgers, Harvard, and Georgia Tech to under thirty points each. Virginia also held Harvard to a single field goal in the first half of their game, tying the NCAA record for fewest field goals allowed in the first half of a game since the [[shot clock]] was instituted in 1986.<ref name=\"harvard_record\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/cavalierinsider/no-virginia-hammers-harvard-in-historic-fashion/article_9f233f4a-8944-11e4-b194-8be8c6067517.html |title=No. 6 Virginia hammers Harvard in historic fashion |first=Whitey |last=Reid |work=[[The Daily Progress]] |date=22 December 2014 |accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"harvard_espn\">{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/101636/the-most-impressive-part-of-uvas-49-point-win |title=Most impressive part of UVa's 49-point win |first=Eammonn |last=Brennan |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=22 December 2014 |accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref> However, late-season injuries, in particular [[Justin Anderson (basketball)|Justin Anderson's]] nearly five-week-long absence due to a broken finger and appendectomy, hurt the team, with the Cavaliers falling in a close loss to North Carolina in the [[2015 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]] semifinals.

The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket.

As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Springfield Model 1861|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet. They would carry their Springfields until their end of service.\n\n==Casualties and total strength==\nThe 17th Maine enrolled 1,371 men during its existence.<ref>http://www.state.me.us/sos/arc/archives/military/civilwar/17meinf.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230092433/http://www.state.me.us/sos/arc/archives/military/civilwar/17meinf.htm |date=2006-12-30 }} State of Maine Civil War Records Website</ref> It lost 12 officers and 116 enlisted men killed in action or died of wounds received in battle and an additional 4 officers and 159 enlisted men died of disease.<ref>http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unmeinf1.htm Civil War Archive Website, after Dyer</ref>  31 men died in Confederate prisons.

Along with [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], Norwegian forms a [[dialect continuum]] of more or less [[mutually intelligible]] local and regional varieties; some Norwegian and Swedish dialects, in particular, are very close. These [[Scandinavia]]n languages, together with [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] as well as some extinct languages, constitute the North Germanic languages.

While the two Germanic languages with the greatest numbers of speakers, [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], have close similarities with Norwegian, neither is mutually intelligible with it. Norwegian is a descendant of [[Old Norse]], the common language of the [[Germanic peoples]] living in Scandinavia during the [[Viking Age|Viking Era]].\n\nToday there are two official forms of {{em|written}} Norwegian, ''[[Bokm\u00e5l]]'' (literally \"book tongue\") and ''[[Nynorsk]]'' (\"new Norwegian\"), each with its own variants. ''Bokm\u00e5l'' developed from the [[Dano-Norwegian]] [[koin\u00e9 language|''koin\u00e9'' language]] that evolved under the union of [[Denmark-Norway]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, while ''Nynorsk'' was developed based upon a collective of spoken Norwegian dialects. Norwegian is one of the two official languages in Norway. The other is [[Sami language|Sami]], spoken by some members of the Sami people, mostly in the Northern part of Norway. Norwegian and Sami are not mutually intelligible, as Sami belongs to the [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] group of languages. Sami is spoken by less than one percent of people in Norway.\n\nNorwegian is one of the working languages of the [[Nordic Council]]. Under the [[Nordic Language Convention]], citizens of the [[Nordic countries]] who speak Norwegian have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any [[interpreting|interpretation]] or [[translation]] costs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/avtal/utbildning/sk/sprak.asp |title=Konvention mellan Sverige, Danmark, Finland, Island och Norge om nordiska medborgares r\u00e4tt att anv\u00e4nda sitt eget spr\u00e5k i annat nordiskt land |trans-title=Convention between Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway on the right of Nordic citizens to use their own language in another Nordic country |date=2 May 2007 |website=[[Nordic Council]] |language=no |access-date=4 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220234459/http://www.norden.org/avtal/utbildning/sk/sprak.asp |archive-date=20 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6777&lang=6 |title=20th anniversary of the Nordic Language Convention |date=22 February 2007 |website=Nordic Council |access-date=25 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227013320/http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6777&lang=6 |archive-date=27 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n{{Old Norse language map}}\n\nLike most of the languages in Europe, the Norwegian language descends from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]<!-- PIE homeland and dating are subject to debates. It's not good to peremptorily insist on one of the hypotheses. -->. As early Indo-Europeans spread across Europe, they became isolated and new languages evolved. In the northwest of Europe, the [[West Germanic languages]] evolved, which would eventually become [[English language|English]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], and the [[North Germanic languages]], of which Norwegian is one.\n \n[[Proto-Norse]] is thought to have evolved as a northern dialect of [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] during the first centuries AD in what is today Southern Sweden. It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language [[Attested language|attested]] in the [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions, the oldest form of the [[runic alphabets]]. A number of inscriptions are memorials to the dead, while others are magical in content. The oldest are carved on loose objects, while later ones are chiseled in [[runestone]]s.<ref name=\"scan-langs\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-languages |title=Scandinavian languages |first1=Jan Terje |last1=Faarlund |first2=Einar |last2=Haugen |journal=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |volume=99 |issue=2495 |pages=505 |accessdate=September 11, 2016|bibcode=1917Natur..99..505T |year=1917 |doi=10.1038/099505a0 }}</ref> They are the oldest written record of any Germanic language.\n\nAround 800 AD, the script was simplified to the [[Younger Futhark]], and inscriptions became more abundant. At the same time, the beginning of the [[Viking Age]] led to the spread of [[Old Norse]] to [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], and the [[Faroe Islands]]. Viking colonies also existed in parts of the [[British Isles]], France ([[Normandy]]), North America, and [[Kievan Rus]]. In all of these places except Iceland and the Faroes, Old Norse speakers went extinct or were absorbed into the local population.<ref name=\"scan-langs\"/>\n\n===The Roman alphabet===\nAround 1030, Christianity came to Scandinavia, bringing with it an influx of [[Latin]] borrowings and the [[Roman alphabet]]. These new words were related to [[Catholic church|church]] practices and ceremonies, although many other loanwords related to general culture also entered the language.\n\nThe Scandinavian languages at this time are not considered to be separate languages, although there were minor differences among what are customarily called Old Icelandic, [[Old Norwegian]], [[Old Gutnish]], Old Danish, and [[Old Swedish]].\n\n===Low German influence===\nThe economic and political dominance of the [[Hanseatic League]] between 1250 and 1450 in the main Scandinavian cities brought large [[Middle Low German]]-speaking populations to Norway. The influence of their language on Scandinavian is similar to that of [[French language|French]] on English after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]].<ref name=\"scan-langs\"/>\n\n===Dano-Norwegian===\nIn the late Middle Ages, dialects began to develop in Scandinavia because the population was rural and little travel occurred. When the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] came from Germany, [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Upper German|High German]] translation of the Bible was quickly translated into Swedish, Danish, and Icelandic. Norway entered a union with Denmark in 1397 and Danish became the language of the elite, the church, literature, and the law. When the union with Denmark ended in 1814, the [[Dano-Norwegian]] [[koin\u00e9 language|''koin\u00e9'']] had become the mother tongue of many Norwegians.<ref name=\"now\">{{cite web  |url=https://www.ntnu.edu/now/intro/background-norwegian |title=The Norwegian language |first=Olaf |last=Husby |date=October 2010 |website=Norwegian on the Web |accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Danish to Norwegian===\n{{Main|Norwegian language struggle}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\n{{split|Samnorsk|date=January 2017}}\nFrom the 1840s, some writers experimented with a Norwegianised Danish by incorporating words that were descriptive of Norwegian scenery and folk life, and adopting a more Norwegian syntax. [[Knud Knudsen (linguist)|Knud Knudsen]] proposed to change spelling and inflection in accordance with the Dano-Norwegian ''koin\u00e9'', known as \"cultivated everyday speech.\" A small adjustment in this direction was implemented in the first official reform of the Danish language in Norway in 1862 and more extensively after his death in two official reforms in 1907 and 1917.\n\nMeanwhile, a nationalistic movement strove for the development of a new written Norwegian. [[Ivar Aasen]], a botanist and self-taught linguist, began his work to create a new Norwegian language at the age of 22. He traveled around the country collecting words and examples of grammar from the dialects and comparing the dialects among the different regions. He examined the development of [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which had largely escaped the influences under which Norwegian had come. He called his work, which was published in several books from 1848 to 1873, [[Landsm\u00e5l]], meaning \"national language\". The name \"Landsm\u00e5l\" is sometimes interpreted as \"rural language\" or \"country language\", but this was clearly not Aasen's intended meaning.\n\nThe name of the Danish language in Norway was a topic of hot dispute through the 19th century. Its proponents claimed that it was a language common to Norway and Denmark, and no more Danish than Norwegian. The proponents of Landsm\u00e5l thought that the Danish character of the language should not be concealed. In 1899, [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]] proposed the neutral name [[Riksm\u00e5l]], meaning national language like Landsm\u00e5l, and this was officially adopted along with the 1907 spelling reform. The name \"Riksm\u00e5l\" is sometimes interpreted as \"state language\", but this meaning is secondary at best. (Compare to [[Danish language|Danish rigsm\u00e5l]] from where the name was borrowed.)\n\nAfter the personal union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905, both languages were developed further and reached what is now considered their classic forms after a reform in 1917. Riksm\u00e5l was in 1929 officially renamed ''Bokm\u00e5l'' (literally \"book language\"), and Landsm\u00e5l to ''Nynorsk'' (literally \"new Norwegian\"). A proposition to substitute Danish-Norwegian (''dansk-norsk'') for ''Bokm\u00e5l'' lost in parliament by a single vote. The name ''Nynorsk'', the linguistic term for [[modern Norwegian]], was chosen to contrast with Danish and emphasis on the historical connection to Old Norwegian. Today, this meaning is often lost, and it is commonly mistaken as a \"new\" Norwegian in contrast to the \"real\" Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l.\n\nBokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk were made closer by a reform in 1938. This was a result of a state policy to merge Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l into a single language, to be called ''Samnorsk''. A 1946 poll showed that this policy was supported by 79% of Norwegians at the time. However, opponents of the official policy still managed to create a massive protest movement against ''Samnorsk'' in the 1950s, fighting in particular the use of \"radical\" forms in Bokm\u00e5l text books in schools. In the reform in 1959, the 1938 reform was partially reversed in Bokm\u00e5l, but Nynorsk was changed further towards Bokm\u00e5l. Since then Bokm\u00e5l has reverted even further toward traditional Riksm\u00e5l, while Nynorsk still adheres to the 1959 standard. Therefore, a small minority of Nynorsk enthusiasts use a more conservative standard called [[H\u00f8gnorsk]]. The Samnorsk policy had little influence after 1960, and was officially abandoned in 2002.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main|Norwegian phonology}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nWhile the sound systems of Norwegian and Swedish are similar, considerable variation exists among the dialects.\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Consonant phonemes of Urban East Norwegian\n!\n!

They are used to differentiate two-syllable words with otherwise identical pronunciation. For example, in many East Norwegian dialects, the word \"{{lang|no|b\u00f8nder}}\" (farmers) is pronounced using the simpler tone 1, while \"{{lang|no|b\u00f8nner}}\" (beans or prayers) uses the more complex tone 2. Though spelling differences occasionally differentiate written words, in most cases the minimal pairs are written alike, since written Norwegian has no explicit accent marks. In most eastern low-tone dialects, accent 1 uses a low flat pitch in the first syllable, while accent 2 uses a high, sharply falling pitch in the first syllable and a low pitch in the beginning of the second syllable. In both accents, these pitch movements are followed by a rise of [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]al nature (phrase accent)\u2014the size (and presence) of which signals emphasis or focus, and corresponds in function to the normal accent in languages that lack [[tone (linguistics)|lexical tone]], such as English. That rise culminates in the final syllable of an accentual phrase, while the utterance-final fall common in most languages is either very small or absent.\n\nThere are significant variations in pitch accent between dialects. Thus, in most of western and northern Norway (the so-called high-pitch dialects) accent 1 is falling, while accent 2 is rising in the first syllable and falling in the second syllable or somewhere around the syllable boundary. The pitch accents (as well as the peculiar phrase accent in the low-tone dialects) give the Norwegian language a \"singing\" quality that makes it easy to distinguish from other languages. Accent 1 generally occurs in words that were monosyllabic in [[Old Norse]], and accent 2 in words that were polysyllabic.\n\n==Written language==\n[[File:Illuminated keyboard 2.JPG|thumb|right|Danish keyboard with keys for \u00c6, \u00d8, and \u00c5.

As loanwords are assimilated into Norwegian, their spelling might change to reflect Norwegian pronunciation and the principles of Norwegian orthography, e.g. ''[[zebra]]'' in Norwegian is written ''sebra''. Due to historical reasons, some otherwise Norwegian family names are also written using these letters.\n\nSome letters may be modified by [[diacritic]]s: ''\u00e9'', ''\u00e8'', ''\u00ea'', ''\u00f3'', ''\u00f2'', and ''\u00f4''. In Nynorsk, ''\u00ec'' and ''\u00f9'' and ''\u1ef3'' are occasionally seen as well. The diacritics are not compulsory, but may in a few cases distinguish between different meanings of the word, e.g.: for (for/to), f\u00f3r (went), f\u00f2r (furrow) and f\u00f4r (fodder). Loanwords may be spelled with other diacritics, most notably ''\u00fc'', ''\u00e1'' and ''\u00e0''.\n\n===Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk===\n{{Main|Bokm\u00e5l|Nynorsk}}\nAs established by law and government policy, the two official forms of ''written'' Norwegian are ''[[Bokm\u00e5l]]'' (literally \"book tongue\") and ''[[Nynorsk]]'' (\"new Norwegian\"). The official [[Norwegian Language Council]] (''Spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det'') is responsible for regulating the two forms, and recommends the terms \"Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l\" and \"Norwegian Nynorsk\" in English.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Two other written forms without official status also exist, one, called ''[[Riksm\u00e5l]]'' (\"national language\"), is today to a large extent the same language as Bokm\u00e5l though somewhat closer to the Danish language. It is regulated by the unofficial [[Norwegian Academy]], which translates the name as \"Standard Norwegian\". The other is ''[[H\u00f8gnorsk]]'' (\"High Norwegian\"), a more [[Linguistic purism|purist]] form of Nynorsk, which maintains the language in an original form as given by [[Ivar Aasen]] and rejects most of the reforms from the 20th century; this form has limited use.\n\nNynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l provide standards for how to write Norwegian, but not for how to speak the language. No standard of spoken Norwegian is officially sanctioned, and most [[Norwegian dialects|Norwegians speak their own dialects]] in all circumstances. Thus, unlike in many other countries, the use of any Norwegian dialect, whether it coincides with the written norms or not, is accepted as correct ''spoken'' Norwegian. However, in areas where [[Norwegian dialects|East Norwegian dialects]] are used, a tendency exists to accept a ''de facto'' spoken standard for this particular regional dialect, ''[[Urban East Norwegian]]'' or ''Standard East Norwegian'' ({{lang-no|Standard \u00d8stnorsk| links=no}}), in which the vocabulary coincides with Bokm\u00e5l.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk/index.php/sin/article/viewFile/17027/14789 |title=Om begrepene spr\u00e5klig standard og spr\u00e5klig standardisering |trans-title=About the terms linguistic standard and linguistic standardization |last=Vannebo |first=Kjell Ivar |journal=Sprog I Norden |language=no |date=2001 |pages=119\u2013128 |access-date=23 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Kristoffersen\">{{cite book |last=Kristoffersen |first=Gjert |authorlink=Gjert Kristoffersen |title=The Phonology of Norwegian |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |pages=6\u201311 |isbn=978-0-19-823765-5}}</ref> Outside [[Eastern Norway]], this spoken variation is not used.\n\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, Danish was the standard written language of Norway. As a result, the development of modern written Norwegian has been subject to strong controversy related to [[nationalism]], rural versus urban discourse, and Norway's literary history. Historically, Bokm\u00e5l is a Norwegianised variety of Danish, while Nynorsk is a language form based on Norwegian dialects and puristic opposition to Danish. The now-abandoned official policy to merge Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk into one common language called ''Samnorsk'' through a series of spelling reforms has created a wide spectrum of varieties of both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk. The unofficial form known as ''Riksm\u00e5l'' is considered more [[conservative (language)|conservative]] than Bokm\u00e5l and is far closer to Danish while the unofficial ''H\u00f8gnorsk'' is more conservative than Nynorsk and is far closer to [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Old Norse]].\n\nNorwegians are educated in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk. The language form that is not registered as the main language form of a Norwegian student will be a mandatory school subject in both high school and elementary school for the student, which is called Sidem\u00e5l.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.udir.no/kl06/NOR1-05|title=L\u00e6replan i norsk (NOR1-05)|website=www.udir.no|language=nb|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref> For instance, a Norwegian with Bokm\u00e5l as its main language form has Nynorsk as a mandatory school subject throughout both high school and elementary school.

Examples are [[Setesdal]], the western part of [[Telemark]] county (''fylke'') and several municipalities in [[Hallingdal]], [[Valdres]], and [[Gudbrandsdalen]]. It is little used elsewhere, but 30\u201340 years ago, it also had strongholds in many rural parts of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] (mid-Norway) and the southern part of northern Norway ([[Nordland]] county). Today, not only is Nynorsk the official language of four of the 19 Norwegian counties, but also of many municipalities in five other counties. [[NRK]], the Norwegian broadcasting corporation, broadcasts in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, and all governmental agencies are required to support both written languages. Bokm\u00e5l is used in 92% of all written publications, and Nynorsk in 8% (2000).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nLike some other European countries, Norway has an official \"advisory board\"{{mdash}} [[Norwegian Language Council|Spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det]] (Norwegian Language Council){{mdash}} that determines, after approval from the Ministry of Culture, official spelling, grammar, and vocabulary for the Norwegian language. The board's work has been subject to considerable controversy throughout the years.\n\nBoth Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l have a great variety of optional forms. The Bokm\u00e5l that uses the forms that are close to Riksm\u00e5l is called ''moderate'' or ''conservative'', depending on one's viewpoint, while the Bokm\u00e5l that uses the forms that are close to Nynorsk is called ''radical''.

Since the reforms of 1981 and 2003 (effective in 2005), the official Bokm\u00e5l can be adapted to be almost identical with modern Riksm\u00e5l. The differences between written Riksm\u00e5l and Bokm\u00e5l are comparable to [[American and British English differences]].\n\nRiksm\u00e5l is regulated by the [[Norwegian Academy]], which determines acceptable spelling, grammar, and vocabulary.\n\n===H\u00f8gnorsk===\n{{Main|H\u00f8gnorsk}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nThere is also an unofficial form of Nynorsk, called ''H\u00f8gnorsk'', discarding the post-1917 reforms, and thus close to Ivar Aasen's original Landsm\u00e5l.

Of 4,549 state publications in 2000 8% were in Nynorsk, and 92% in Bokm\u00e5l. The large national newspapers ([[Aftenposten]], [[Dagbladet]], and [[Verdens Gang|VG]]) are published in Bokm\u00e5l or Riksm\u00e5l. Some major regional newspapers (including ''[[Bergens Tidende]]'' and ''[[Stavanger Aftenblad]]''), many political journals, and many local newspapers use both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk.\n\nA newer trend is to write in dialect for informal use. When writing an SMS, Facebook update, or fridge note, most younger people write the way they talk rather than using Bokm\u00e5l or Nynorsk.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Dialects==\n{{Main|Norwegian dialects}}\n[[File:Norske M\u00e5lgreiner.png|thumb|The map shows the division of the Norwegian dialects within the main groups.]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nThere is general agreement that a wide range of differences makes it difficult to estimate the number of different Norwegian dialects. Variations in grammar, syntax, vocabulary, and pronunciation cut across geographical boundaries and can create a distinct dialect at the level of farm clusters. Dialects are in some cases so dissimilar as to be unintelligible to unfamiliar listeners. Many linguists note a trend toward regionalization of dialects that diminishes the differences at such local levels; there is, however, a renewed interest in preserving dialects.\n\n==Examples==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nBelow are a few sentences giving an indication of the differences between Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, compared to the conservative (closer to Danish) form Riksm\u00e5l, Danish, as well as Old Norse, Swedish, Faroese, Icelandic (the living language grammatically closest to Old Norse), Old English and some modern West Germanic languages:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! width=\"100px\" | Language\n! colspan=\"4\" | Phrase\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[English language|Modern English]]\n! scope=\"col\" | I come from Norway\n! scope=\"col\" | What is his name?\n! scope=\"col\" | This is a horse\n! scope=\"col\" | The rainbow has many colours\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Danish language|Danish]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" | {{lang|da|'''Jeg kommer fra Norge'''}}\n| {{lang|da|Hvad hedder han?}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | {{lang|da|'''Dette er en hest'''}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{lang|da|'''Regnbuen har mange farver'''}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Riksm\u00e5l|Norwegian Riksm\u00e5l]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{lang|nb|'''Hva heter han?'''}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Bokm\u00e5l|Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l]]\n| {{lang|nb|'''Regnbuen har mange farger'''}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Nynorsk|Norwegian Nynorsk]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{lang|nn|'''{{Not a typo|Eg}} kjem fr\u00e5 Noreg'''}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{lang|nn|'''Kva heiter han?'''}}\n| {{lang|nn|'''Dette er ein hest'''}}\n| {{lang|nn|'''Regnbogen har mange fargar/leter'''}} <br/>= {{lang|nn|'''Regnbogen er mangleta'''}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[H\u00f8gnorsk|Norwegian H\u00f8gnorsk]]\n| {{lang|nn|'''Detta er ein hest'''}}\n| {{lang|nn|'''Regnbogen hev mange leter'''}} <br/>= {{lang|nn|'''Regnbogen er mangl\u00ecta'''}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Swedish language|Swedish]]\n| {{lang|sv|Jag kommer fr\u00e5n Norge}}\n| {{lang|sv|Vad heter han?}}\n| {{lang|sv|Detta \u00e4r en h\u00e4st}}\n| {{lang|sv|Regnb\u00e5gen har m\u00e5nga f\u00e4rger}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Old Norse]]\n| {{lang|non|Ek kem fr\u00e1 Noregi}}\n| {{lang|non|Hvat heitir hann?}}\n| {{lang|non|\u00deetta er hross}} /<br/>{{lang|non|\u00deessi er hestr}}\n| {{lang|non|Regnboginn er marglitr}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]\n| {{lang|is|\u00c9g kem fr\u00e1 Noregi}}\n| {{lang|is|Hva\u00f0 heitir hann?}}\n| {{lang|is|\u00deetta er hestur/hross}}\n| {{lang|is|Regnboginn er marglitur}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Faroese language|Faroese]]\n| {{lang|fo|{{Not a typo|Eg}} komi \u00far Noregi/Norra}}\n| {{lang|fo|Hvussu eitur hann?}}\n| {{lang|fo|Hetta er eitt ross / ein hestur}}\n| {{lang|fo|\u00c6labogin hevur n\u00f3gvar litir}} /<br/>{{lang|fo|\u00c6labogin er marglittur}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Old English]]\n| {{lang|ang|Ic cume fram Norwegan}}\n| {{lang|ang|Hwat h\u0101te\u00fe he?}}\n| {{lang|ang|\u00deis is hors}}\n| {{lang|ang|Regnboga h\u00e6f\u00f0 manige hiw}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[German language|German]]\n| {{lang|de|Ich komme aus Norwegen}}\n| {{lang|de|Wie hei\u00dft er?}}\n| {{lang|de|Das ist ein Pferd}}\n| {{lang|de|Der Regenbogen hat viele Farben}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Dutch language|Dutch]]\n| {{lang|nl|Ik kom uit Noorwegen}}\n| {{lang|nl|Hoe heet hij?}}\n| {{lang|nl|Dit is een paard}}\n| {{lang|nl|De regenboog heeft veel (vele) kleuren}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Afrikaans]]\n| {{lang|af|Ek kom van Noorwe\u00eb}}\n| {{lang|af|Wat is sy naam?}}<br/>{{lang|af|Hoe heet hy?}} (more archaic and formal)\n| {{lang|af|Dit is 'n perd}}\n| {{lang|af|Die re\u00ebnboog het baie kleure}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]\n| {{lang|fy|Ik kom \u00fat Noarwegen}}\n| {{lang|fy|Hoe hjit er?}}\n| {{lang|fy|Dit is in hynder}}\n| {{lang|fy|De reinb\u00f4ge hat in protte kleuren}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Low German|Low Saxon]]\n| {{lang|nds|Ik kom \u00fc\u00fct Noorwegen}}\n| {{lang|nds|Ho hit e?}}\n| {{lang|nds|Dit is een peerd}}\n| {{lang|nds|De regenboge hev v\u00f6le kl\u00f6ren}}\n|}\n\n==Grammar==\n===Nouns===\n{{See also|Nynorsk#Nouns}}\nNorwegian [[noun]]s are [[inflection|inflected]] for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular/plural) and for [[definiteness]] (indefinite/definite).

That is, all feminine nouns in Nynorsk must follow the prescribed inflection pattern above.\n\nThere is in general no way to infer what grammatical gender a specific noun has, but there are some patterns of nouns where the gender can be inferred. For instance, all nouns ending in -''nad'' will be masculine in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk (for instance the noun ''jobbs\u00f8knad'', which means job application). Most nouns ending in -''ing'' will be feminine, like the noun ''forventning'' (expectation).\n\nThere are some common irregular nouns, many of which are irregular in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, like the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Irregular noun, fot (foot)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ordbok.uib.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=fot&ant_bokmaal=5&ant_nynorsk=5&begge=+&ordbok=begge|title=Bokm\u00e5lsordboka {{!}} Nynorskordboka|website=ordbok.uib.no|access-date=2018-07-14}}</ref>\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" |Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural\n|-\n!\n!Indefinite\n!Definite\n!Indefinite\n!Definite\n|-\n|Bokm\u00e5l:\n|''en fot''\n|''foten''\n|''f\u00f8tter''\n|''f\u00f8ttene''\n|-\n|Nynorsk:\n|''ein fot''\n|''foten''\n|''f\u00f8ter''\n|''f\u00f8tene''\n|-\n|English:\n|a foot\n|the foot\n|feet\n|the feet\n|}\nIn Nynorsk, even though the irregular word ''fot'' is masculine, it is inflected like a feminine word in the plural. Another word with the same irregular inflection is ''son - s\u00f8ner'' (son - sons).\n\nIn Nynorsk, nouns ending in -''ing'' typically have masculine plural inflections, like the word ''dronning'' in the following table.

To show ownership, there is an enclitic -''s'' similar to English -{{'}}''s''; ''Sondres flotte bil'' (Sondre's nice car, Sondre being a personal name). There are also reflexive possessive pronouns, ''sin'', ''si'', ''sitt'', ''sine''; ''Det er Sondre sitt'' (It is Sondre's). In both Bokm\u00e5l and modern Nynorsk, there is often a mix of both of these to mark possession, though it is more common in Nynorsk to use the reflexive pronouns; in Nynorsk use of the reflexive possessive pronouns is generally encouraged to avoid mixing the enclitic -''s'' with the historical grammatical case remnants of the language. The reflexive pronouns agree in gender and number with the noun.\n\nThe enclitic -''s'' in Norwegian evolved as a shorthand expression for the possessive pronouns ''sin'', ''si'', ''sitt'' and ''sine''. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Examples\n|-\n!Norwegian (with pronoun)\n!Norwegian (with enclitic 's)\n!English\n|-\n|Jenta sin bil\n|Jentas bil\n|The girl's car\n|-\n| Mannen si kone\n|Mannens kone\n| The man's wife\n|-\n|Gutten sitt leket\u00f8y\n|Guttens leket\u00f8y\n|The boy's toy\n|-\n|Kona sine barn\n|Konas barn\n|The wife's children\n|-\n|Det er statsministeren sitt\n|Det er statsministerens\n|It is the prime minister's\n|}\n\n===Adjectives===\n{{See also|Nynorsk#Adjectives}}\nNorwegian [[adjective]]s, like those of Swedish and Danish, inflect for [[definiteness]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]], [[Grammatical number|number]] and for [[Comparison (grammar)|comparison]] (affirmative/comparative/superlative).

Some of the dialects that have preserved the [[dative case|dative]] in nouns, also have a dative case instead of the accusative case in personal pronouns, while others have accusative in pronouns and dative in nouns, effectively giving these dialects three distinct cases.\n\nIn the most comprehensive Norwegian grammar, [[Norsk referansegrammatikk]], the categorization of personal pronouns by [[grammatical person|person]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], and [[grammatical number|number]] is not regarded as inflection.

Just like adjectives, they have to agree in gender with the noun.\n\nBokm\u00e5l has two sets of 3rd person pronouns. ''Han'' and ''hun'' refer to male and female individuals respectively, ''den'' and ''det'' refer to impersonal or inanimate nouns, of masculine/feminine or neutral gender respectively. In contrast, Nynorsk and most dialects use the same set of pronouns ''han'' (he), ''ho'' (she) and ''det'' (it) for both personal and impersonal references, just like in [[German language|German]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Old Norse]]. ''Det'' also has [[Syntactic expletive|expletive]] and [[cataphora|cataphoric]] uses like in the English examples '''''it''' rains'' and '''''it''' was known by everyone '''(that) he had travelled the world'''''.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Examples in Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l of the use of the pronoun \u00abit\u00bb\n\n!Nynorsk\n!Bokm\u00e5l\n!English\n|-\n|Kor er boka mi?

When there is no adjective, the most common word order is the one used in the examples in the table above, where the possessive comes after the noun, while the noun is in its definite form; \u00abboka mi\u00bb (my book). If one wishes to emphasize the owner of the noun, the possessive pronoun usually come first. In Bokm\u00e5l however, due to its Danish origins, one could choose to always write the possessive first \u00abmin bil\u00bb (my car), but this may sound very formal. Some dialects that have been very influenced by Danish do this too, some speakers in [[B\u00e6rum]] and the [[Oslo West|west of Oslo]] may always use this word order. When there is an adjective describing the noun, the possessive pronoun will always come first; \u00abmin egen bil\u00bb (my own car).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Norwegian (Bokm\u00e5l/Nynorsk)\n!English\n|-\n|Det er ''mi'' bok!\n|It is ''my'' book!

These are [[interjection]]s, [[grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]], [[grammatical conjunction|subjunctions]], [[preposition]]s, and [[adverbs]]. The inclusion of adverbs here requires that traditional adverbs that are inflected in [[Comparison (grammar)|comparison]] be classified as adjectives, as is sometimes done.\n\n==== Adverbs ====\n[[Adverb]]s can be formed from [[adjective]]s in Norwegian. English usually creates adverbs from adjectives by the suffix ''-ly,'' like the adverb ''beautifully'' from the adjective ''beautiful.'' By comparison, [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]] usually form adverbs from adjectives by the [[Neuter (grammar)|grammatical neuter]] singular form of the adjective. This is in general true for both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk.\n\nExample ([[Bokm\u00e5l]]):\n\n* Han er ''grusom'' (He is ''terrible'')\n* Det er ''grusomt'' (It is terrible)\n* Han er ''grusomt'' treig (He is ''terribly'' slow)\n\nIn the third sentence, ''grusomt'' is an adverb. In the first and second sentence ''grusomt'' and ''grusom'' are adjectives and have to agree in grammatical gender with the noun.\n\nAnother example is the adjective ''vakker'' (beautiful) which exist in both Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l and has the neuter singular form ''vakkert.''\n\nExample ([[Nynorsk]]):\n\n* Ho er ''vakker'' (She is ''beautiful'') \n* Det er ''vakkert'' (It is ''beautiful'')\n* Ho syng ''vakkert'' (She sings ''beautifully)''\n\n===Compound words===\nIn Norwegian [[compound (linguistics)|compound words]], the [[head (linguistics)|head]], i.e. the part determining the compound's class, is the last part. If the compound word is constructed from many different nouns, the last noun in the compound noun will determine the gender of the compound noun. Only the first part has primary stress. For instance, the compound ''tenketank'' (think tank) has primary stress on the first syllable and is a masculine noun since the noun \u00abtank\u00bb is masculine.\n\nCompound words are written together in Norwegian, which can cause words to become very long, for example ''{{lang|no|sannsynlighetsmaksimeringsestimator}}'' ([[maximum likelihood]] [[estimator]]) and ''{{lang|no|menneskerettighetsorganisasjoner}}'' (human rights organizations). Other examples are the title ''h\u00f8yesterettsjustitiarius'' (Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, originally a combination of [[supreme court]] and the actual title, [[justiciar]]) and the translation ''En midtsommernattsdr\u00f8m'' for ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''.\n\nIf they are not written together, each part is naturally read with primary stress, and the meaning of the compound is lost. Examples of this in English are the difference between a green house and a greenhouse or a black board and a blackboard.\n\nThis is sometimes forgotten, occasionally with humorous results. Instead of writing, for example, ''{{lang|no|lammekoteletter}}'' (lamb chops), people make the mistake of writing ''{{lang|no|lamme koteletter}}'' (lame, or paralyzed, chops). The original message can even be reversed, as when ''{{lang|no|r\u00f8ykfritt}}'' (lit. \"smoke-free\" meaning no smoking) becomes ''{{lang|no|r\u00f8yk fritt}}'' (smoke freely).\n\nOther examples include:\n* ''Terrasse d\u00f8r'' (\"Terrace dies\") instead of ''Terrassed\u00f8r'' (\"Terrace door\")\n* ''Tunfisk biter'' (\"Tuna bites\", verb) instead of ''Tunfiskbiter'' (\"Tuna bits\", noun)\n* ''Smult ringer'' (\"Lard calls\", verb) instead of ''Smultringer'' (\"Doughnuts\")\n* ''Tyveri sikret'' (\"Theft guaranteed\") instead of ''Tyverisikret'' (\"Theft proof\")\n* ''Stekt kylling lever'' (\"Fried chicken lives\", verb) instead of ''Stekt kyllinglever'' (\"Fried chicken liver\", noun)\n* ''Sm\u00f8r br\u00f8d'' (\"Butter bread\", verb) instead of ''Sm\u00f8rbr\u00f8d'' (\"Sandwich\")\n* ''Klipp fisk'' (\"Cut fish\", verb) instead of ''Klippfisk'' (\"Clipfish\")\n* ''P\u00e5 hytte taket'' (\"On cottage the roof\") instead of ''P\u00e5 hyttetaket'' (\"On the cottage roof\")\n* ''Altfor Norge'' (\"Too Norway\") instead of ''Alt for Norge'' (\"Everything for Norway\", the royal motto of Norway)\nThese misunderstandings occur because most nouns can be interpreted as verbs or other types of words.\nSimilar misunderstandings can be achieved in English too. The following are examples of phrases that both in Norwegian and English mean one thing as a compound word, and something different when regarded as separate words:\n* ''stavekontroll'' (spellchecker) or ''stave kontroll'' (spell checker)\n* ''kokebok'' (cookbook) or ''koke bok'' (cook book)\n* ''ekte h\u00e5ndlagde vafler'' (real handmade waffles) or ''ekte h\u00e5nd lagde vafler'' (real hand made waffles)\n\n=== Syntax ===\nNorwegian syntax is predominantly [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]] with the subject of the sentence coming first, the verb coming second, and the object after that. However, like many other Germanic languages, it follows the [[V2 word order|V2 rule]], which means that the finite verb is invariably the second element in a sentence. For example:\n\n\u2022\"<u>Jeg</u> '''spiser''' fisk ''i dag''\" (<u>I</u> '''eat''' fish ''today'')\n\n\u2022\"''I dag'' '''spiser''' <u>jeg</u> fisk\" (''Today'', <u>I</u> '''eat''' fish)\n\n\u2022\"<u>Jeg</u> '''vil''' drikke kaffe ''i dag''\" (<u>I</u> '''want''' to drink coffee ''today'')\n\n\u2022\"''I dag'' '''vil''' <u>jeg</u> drikke kaffe\" (''Today'', <u>I</u> '''want''' to drink coffee)\n\nRegardless of which element is placed first, the finite verb comes second.\n\nAttributive adjectives always precede the noun that they modify.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\n[[File:Ambulanse Oslo Akershus 18jun2005.jpg|thumb|Norwegian ambulances changed their markings in 2005. This is the old appearance, with the Norwegian ''{{lang|no|ambulanse}}'', \"Ambulance.\"]]\nNorwegian vocabulary descends primarily from Old Norse. [[Middle Low German]] is the largest source of loanwords, having a marked influence on Norwegian vocabulary from the late Middle Ages onwards (in addition some impact on grammatical structures such as genitive constructions). Many of these loanwords, however, while found in Bokm\u00e5l and many dialects, are absent from Nynorsk, which retains or has substituted words derived from Old Norse. Nynorsk thus shares more vocabulary with Icelandic and Faroese than does Bokm\u00e5l.\n\nAt present, the main source of new loanwords is English e.g. ''rapper'', ''e-mail'', ''catering'', ''juice'', ''bag'' (itself possibly a loan word to English from Old Norse). Norwegian has also borrowed words and phrases from Danish and Swedish and continues to do so.\n\nThe spelling of some loanwords has been adapted to Norwegian orthographic conventions, but in general Norwegianised spellings have taken a long time to take hold. For example, ''{{lang|no|sj\u00e5f\u00f8r}}'' (from [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|chauffeur}}'') and ''{{lang|no|revansj}}'' (from French ''{{lang|fr|revanche}}'') are now the common Norwegian spellings, but ''juice'' is more often used than the Norwegianised form ''{{lang|no|jus}}'', ''catering'' more often than ''{{lang|no|keitering}}'', ''service'' more often than ''{{lang|no|s\u00f8rvis}}'', etc.\n\nIn the case of Danish and Swedish, the spelling in Norwegian of both loanwords and native cognates is often less conservative than the spelling in those languages, and, arguably, closer to the pronunciation. Four of the letters most shunned in Norwegian in comparison to the other Scandinavian languages are \"c\", \"d\", \"j\" and \"x\". Norwegian ''{{lang|no|hei}}'' is ''{{lang|sv|hej}}'' in Swedish and Danish; the words \"sex\" and \"six\" are ''{{lang|no|sex}}'' and ''{{lang|no|seks}}'' in Norwegian, but in Swedish they are both ''{{lang|sv|sex}}''; Danish words ending in ''{{lang|da|-tion}}'' end in ''{{lang|no|-sjon}}'' to reflect pronunciation and many traditional Danish spellings with ''d'' preceded by another consonant are changed to double consonants, such as in the Danish for water, ''{{lang|da|vand}}'', versus Norwegian (Bokm\u00e5l) spelling ''{{lang|nb|vann}}'', but \"sand\" is spelled ''{{lang|no|sand}}'' in both languages (Norwegian was standardized this way because in some dialects a \"d\" was pronounced in ''{{lang|no|sand}}'', whereas Norwegian speakers pronounced ''{{lang|no|vann}}'' without a \"d\"-sound). (The word for water in Nynorsk is ''{{lang|nn|vatn}}''.)\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Norway|Languages}}\n{{InterWiki|Main_Page=Hovedside|code=no|Bokm\u00e5l}}\n{{InterWiki|Main_Page=Hovudside|code=nn|Nynorsk}}\n{{wiktionary category}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Norwegian phrasebook|Norwegian|a phrasebook}}\n{{NIE Poster|year=1905|Norwegian Language}}\n\n* [[Differences between the Norwegian and Danish languages]]\n* [[Noregs M\u00e5llag]]\n* [[Norsk Ordbok (Nynorsk)|Norsk Ordbok]]\n* [[Det Norske Akademi for Sprog og Litteratur]]\n* [[Riksm\u00e5lsforbundet]]\n* [[Russenorsk]]\n* [[Tone (linguistics)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Philip Holmes (linguist)|Philip Holmes]], [[Hans-Olav Enger]], 'Norwegian.

Along with [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], Norwegian forms a [[dialect continuum]] of more or less [[mutually intelligible]] local and regional varieties; some Norwegian and Swedish dialects, in particular, are very close. These [[Scandinavia]]n languages, together with [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] as well as some extinct languages, constitute the North Germanic languages. Faroese and Icelandic are not mutually intelligible with Norwegian in their spoken form because continental Scandinavian has diverged from them. While the two Germanic languages with the greatest numbers of speakers, [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], have close similarities with Norwegian, neither is mutually intelligible with it. Norwegian is a descendant of [[Old Norse]], the common language of the [[Germanic peoples]] living in Scandinavia during the [[Viking Age|Viking Era]].\n\nToday there are two official forms of {{em|written}} Norwegian, ''[[Bokm\u00e5l]]'' (literally \"book tongue\") and ''[[Nynorsk]]'' (\"new Norwegian\"), each with its own variants. ''Bokm\u00e5l'' developed from the [[Dano-Norwegian]] [[koin\u00e9 language|''koin\u00e9'' language]] that evolved under the union of [[Denmark-Norway]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, while ''Nynorsk'' was developed based upon a collective of spoken Norwegian dialects. Norwegian is one of the two official languages in Norway. The other is [[Sami language|Sami]], spoken by some members of the Sami people, mostly in the Northern part of Norway. Norwegian and Sami are not mutually intelligible, as Sami belongs to the Finno-Ugric group of languages. Sami is spoken by less than one percent of people in Norway.\n\nNorwegian is one of the working languages of the [[Nordic Council]]. Under the [[Nordic Language Convention]], citizens of the [[Nordic countries]] who speak Norwegian have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any [[interpreting|interpretation]] or [[translation]] costs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/avtal/utbildning/sk/sprak.asp |title=Konvention mellan Sverige, Danmark, Finland, Island och Norge om nordiska medborgares r\u00e4tt att anv\u00e4nda sitt eget spr\u00e5k i annat nordiskt land |trans-title=Convention between Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway on the right of Nordic citizens to use their own language in another Nordic country |date=2 May 2007 |website=[[Nordic Council]] |language=no |access-date=4 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220234459/http://www.norden.org/avtal/utbildning/sk/sprak.asp |archive-date=20 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6777&lang=6 |title=20th anniversary of the Nordic Language Convention |date=22 February 2007 |website=Nordic Council |access-date=25 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227013320/http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6777&lang=6 |archive-date=27 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n{{Old Norse language map}}\n\nLike most of the languages in Europe, the Norwegian language descends from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]<!-- PIE homeland and dating are subject to debates. It's not good to peremptorily insist on one of the hypotheses. -->. As early Indo-Europeans spread across Europe, they became isolated and new languages evolved. In the northwest of Europe, the [[West Germanic languages]] evolved, which would eventually become [[English language|English]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], and the [[North Germanic languages]], of which Norwegian is one.\n \n[[Proto-Norse]] is thought to have evolved as a northern dialect of [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] during the first centuries AD in what is today Southern Sweden. It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language [[Attested language|attested]] in the [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions, the oldest form of the [[runic alphabets]]. A number of inscriptions are memorials to the dead, while others are magical in content. The oldest are carved on loose objects, while later ones are chiseled in [[runestone]]s.<ref name=\"scan-langs\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-languages |title=Scandinavian languages |first1=Jan Terje |last1=Faarlund |first2=Einar |last2=Haugen |journal=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |volume=99 |issue=2495 |pages=505 |accessdate=September 11, 2016|bibcode=1917Natur..99..505T |year=1917 |doi=10.1038/099505a0 }}</ref> They are the oldest written record of any Germanic language.\n\nAround 800 AD, the script was simplified to the [[Younger Futhark]], and inscriptions became more abundant. At the same time, the beginning of the [[Viking Age]] led to the spread of [[Old Norse]] to [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], and the [[Faroe Islands]]. Viking colonies also existed in parts of the [[British Isles]], France ([[Normandy]]), North America, and [[Kievan Rus]]. In all of these places except Iceland and the Faroes, Old Norse speakers went extinct or were absorbed into the local population.<ref name=\"scan-langs\"/>\n\n===The Roman alphabet===\nAround 1030, Christianity came to Scandinavia, bringing with it an influx of [[Latin]] borrowings and the [[Roman alphabet]]. These new words were related to [[Catholic church|church]] practices and ceremonies, although many other loanwords related to general culture also entered the language.\n\nThe Scandinavian languages at this time are not considered to be separate languages, although there were minor differences among what are customarily called Old Icelandic, [[Old Norwegian]], [[Old Gutnish]], Old Danish, and [[Old Swedish]].\n\n===Low German influence===\nThe economic and political dominance of the [[Hanseatic League]] between 1250 and 1450 in the main Scandinavian cities brought large [[Middle Low German]]-speaking populations to Norway. The influence of their language on Scandinavian is similar to that of [[French language|French]] on English after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]].<ref name=\"scan-langs\"/>\n\n===Dano-Norwegian===\nIn the late Middle Ages, dialects began to develop in Scandinavia because the population was rural and little travel occurred. When the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] came from Germany, [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Upper German|High German]] translation of the Bible was quickly translated into Swedish, Danish, and Icelandic. Norway entered a union with Denmark in 1397 and Danish became the language of the elite, the church, literature, and the law. When the union with Denmark ended in 1814, the [[Dano-Norwegian]] [[koin\u00e9 language|''koin\u00e9'']] had become the mother tongue of many Norwegians.<ref name=\"now\">{{cite web  |url=https://www.ntnu.edu/now/intro/background-norwegian |title=The Norwegian language |first=Olaf |last=Husby |date=October 2010 |website=Norwegian on the Web |accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Danish to Norwegian===\n{{Main|Norwegian language struggle}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\n{{split|Samnorsk|date=January 2017}}\nFrom the 1840s, some writers experimented with a Norwegianised Danish by incorporating words that were descriptive of Norwegian scenery and folk life, and adopting a more Norwegian syntax. [[Knud Knudsen (linguist)|Knud Knudsen]] proposed to change spelling and inflection in accordance with the Dano-Norwegian ''koin\u00e9'', known as \"cultivated everyday speech.\" A small adjustment in this direction was implemented in the first official reform of the Danish language in Norway in 1862 and more extensively after his death in two official reforms in 1907 and 1917.\n\nMeanwhile, a nationalistic movement strove for the development of a new written Norwegian. [[Ivar Aasen]], a botanist and self-taught linguist, began his work to create a new Norwegian language at the age of 22. He traveled around the country collecting words and examples of grammar from the dialects and comparing the dialects among the different regions. He examined the development of [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which had largely escaped the influences under which Norwegian had come. He called his work, which was published in several books from 1848 to 1873, [[Landsm\u00e5l]], meaning \"national language\". The name \"Landsm\u00e5l\" is sometimes interpreted as \"rural language\" or \"country language\", but this was clearly not Aasen's intended meaning.\n\nThe name of the Danish language in Norway was a topic of hot dispute through the 19th century. Its proponents claimed that it was a language common to Norway and Denmark, and no more Danish than Norwegian. The proponents of Landsm\u00e5l thought that the Danish character of the language should not be concealed. In 1899, [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]] proposed the neutral name [[Riksm\u00e5l]], meaning national language like Landsm\u00e5l, and this was officially adopted along with the 1907 spelling reform. The name \"Riksm\u00e5l\" is sometimes interpreted as \"state language\", but this meaning is secondary at best. (Compare to [[Danish language|Danish rigsm\u00e5l]] from where the name was borrowed.)\n\nAfter the personal union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905, both languages were developed further and reached what is now considered their classic forms after a reform in 1917. Riksm\u00e5l was in 1929 officially renamed ''Bokm\u00e5l'' (literally \"book language\"), and Landsm\u00e5l to ''Nynorsk'' (literally \"new Norwegian\"). A proposition to substitute Danish-Norwegian (''dansk-norsk'') for ''Bokm\u00e5l'' lost in parliament by a single vote. The name ''Nynorsk'', the linguistic term for [[modern Norwegian]], was chosen to contrast with Danish and emphasis on the historical connection to Old Norwegian. Today, this meaning is often lost, and it is commonly mistaken as a \"new\" Norwegian in contrast to the \"real\" Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l.\n\nBokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk were made closer by a reform in 1938. This was a result of a state policy to merge Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l into a single language, to be called ''Samnorsk''. A 1946 poll showed that this policy was supported by 79% of Norwegians at the time. However, opponents of the official policy still managed to create a massive protest movement against ''Samnorsk'' in the 1950s, fighting in particular the use of \"radical\" forms in Bokm\u00e5l text books in schools. In the reform in 1959, the 1938 reform was partially reversed in Bokm\u00e5l, but Nynorsk was changed further towards Bokm\u00e5l. Since then Bokm\u00e5l has reverted even further toward traditional Riksm\u00e5l, while Nynorsk still adheres to the 1959 standard. Therefore, a small minority of Nynorsk enthusiasts use a more conservative standard called [[H\u00f8gnorsk]]. The Samnorsk policy had little influence after 1960, and was officially abandoned in 2002.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main|Norwegian phonology}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nWhile the sound systems of Norwegian and Swedish are similar, considerable variation exists among the dialects.\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Consonant phonemes of Urban East Norwegian\n!\n!

They are used to differentiate two-syllable words with otherwise identical pronunciation. For example, in many East Norwegian dialects, the word \"{{lang|no|b\u00f8nder}}\" (farmers) is pronounced using the simpler tone 1, while \"{{lang|no|b\u00f8nner}}\" (beans or prayers) uses the more complex tone 2. Though spelling differences occasionally differentiate written words, in most cases the minimal pairs are written alike, since written Norwegian has no explicit accent marks. In most eastern low-tone dialects, accent 1 uses a low flat pitch in the first syllable, while accent 2 uses a high, sharply falling pitch in the first syllable and a low pitch in the beginning of the second syllable. In both accents, these pitch movements are followed by a rise of [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]al nature (phrase accent)\u2014the size (and presence) of which signals emphasis or focus, and corresponds in function to the normal accent in languages that lack [[tone (linguistics)|lexical tone]], such as English. That rise culminates in the final syllable of an accentual phrase, while the utterance-final fall common in most languages is either very small or absent.\n\nThere are significant variations in pitch accent between dialects. Thus, in most of western and northern Norway (the so-called high-pitch dialects) accent 1 is falling, while accent 2 is rising in the first syllable and falling in the second syllable or somewhere around the syllable boundary. The pitch accents (as well as the peculiar phrase accent in the low-tone dialects) give the Norwegian language a \"singing\" quality that makes it easy to distinguish from other languages. Accent 1 generally occurs in words that were monosyllabic in [[Old Norse]], and accent 2 in words that were polysyllabic.\n\n==Written language==\n[[File:Illuminated keyboard 2.JPG|thumb|right|Danish keyboard with keys for \u00c6, \u00d8, and \u00c5.

As loanwords are assimilated into Norwegian, their spelling might change to reflect Norwegian pronunciation and the principles of Norwegian orthography, e.g. ''[[zebra]]'' in Norwegian is written ''sebra''. Due to historical reasons, some otherwise Norwegian family names are also written using these letters.\n\nSome letters may be modified by [[diacritic]]s: ''\u00e9'', ''\u00e8'', ''\u00ea'', ''\u00f3'', ''\u00f2'', and ''\u00f4''. In Nynorsk, ''\u00ec'' and ''\u00f9'' and ''\u1ef3'' are occasionally seen as well. The diacritics are not compulsory, but may in a few cases distinguish between different meanings of the word, e.g.: for (for/to), f\u00f3r (went), f\u00f2r (furrow) and f\u00f4r (fodder). Loanwords may be spelled with other diacritics, most notably ''\u00fc'', ''\u00e1'' and ''\u00e0''.\n\n===Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk===\n{{Main|Bokm\u00e5l|Nynorsk}}\nAs established by law and government policy, the two official forms of ''written'' Norwegian are ''[[Bokm\u00e5l]]'' (literally \"book tongue\") and ''[[Nynorsk]]'' (\"new Norwegian\"). The official [[Norwegian Language Council]] (''Spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det'') is responsible for regulating the two forms, and recommends the terms \"Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l\" and \"Norwegian Nynorsk\" in English.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Two other written forms without official status also exist, one, called ''[[Riksm\u00e5l]]'' (\"national language\"), is today to a large extent the same language as Bokm\u00e5l though somewhat closer to the Danish language. It is regulated by the unofficial [[Norwegian Academy]], which translates the name as \"Standard Norwegian\". The other is ''[[H\u00f8gnorsk]]'' (\"High Norwegian\"), a more [[Linguistic purism|purist]] form of Nynorsk, which maintains the language in an original form as given by [[Ivar Aasen]] and rejects most of the reforms from the 20th century; this form has limited use.\n\nNynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l provide standards for how to write Norwegian, but not for how to speak the language. No standard of spoken Norwegian is officially sanctioned, and most [[Norwegian dialects|Norwegians speak their own dialects]] in all circumstances. Thus, unlike in many other countries, the use of any Norwegian dialect, whether it coincides with the written norms or not, is accepted as correct ''spoken'' Norwegian. However, in areas where [[Norwegian dialects|East Norwegian dialects]] are used, a tendency exists to accept a ''de facto'' spoken standard for this particular regional dialect, ''[[Urban East Norwegian]]'' or ''Standard East Norwegian'' ({{lang-no|Standard \u00d8stnorsk| links=no}}), in which the vocabulary coincides with Bokm\u00e5l.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk/index.php/sin/article/viewFile/17027/14789 |title=Om begrepene spr\u00e5klig standard og spr\u00e5klig standardisering |trans-title=About the terms linguistic standard and linguistic standardization |last=Vannebo |first=Kjell Ivar |journal=Sprog I Norden |language=no |date=2001 |pages=119\u2013128 |access-date=23 June 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Kristoffersen\">{{cite book |last=Kristoffersen |first=Gjert |authorlink=Gjert Kristoffersen |title=The Phonology of Norwegian |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |pages=6\u201311 |isbn=978-0-19-823765-5}}</ref> Outside [[Eastern Norway]], this spoken variation is not used.\n\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, Danish was the standard written language of Norway. As a result, the development of modern written Norwegian has been subject to strong controversy related to [[nationalism]], rural versus urban discourse, and Norway's literary history. Historically, Bokm\u00e5l is a Norwegianised variety of Danish, while Nynorsk is a language form based on Norwegian dialects and puristic opposition to Danish. The now-abandoned official policy to merge Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk into one common language called ''Samnorsk'' through a series of spelling reforms has created a wide spectrum of varieties of both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk. The unofficial form known as ''Riksm\u00e5l'' is considered more [[conservative (language)|conservative]] than Bokm\u00e5l and is far closer to Danish while the unofficial ''H\u00f8gnorsk'' is more conservative than Nynorsk and is far closer to [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Old Norse]].\n\nNorwegians are educated in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk. The language form that is not registered as the main language form of a Norwegian student will be a mandatory school subject in both high school and elementary school for the student, which is called Sidem\u00e5l.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.udir.no/kl06/NOR1-05|title=L\u00e6replan i norsk (NOR1-05)|website=www.udir.no|language=nb|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref> For instance, a Norwegian with Bokm\u00e5l as its main language form has Nynorsk as a mandatory school subject throughout both high school and elementary school. A 2005 poll indicates that 86.3% use primarily Bokm\u00e5l as their daily written language, 5.5% use both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, and 7.5% use primarily Nynorsk.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Thus, 13% are frequently ''writing'' Nynorsk, though the majority ''speak'' dialects that resemble Nynorsk more closely than Bokm\u00e5l.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.apollon.uio.no/vis/art/1998/1/dialekt |last=Ven\u00e5s |first=Kjell |year=1994 |title=Dialekt og normaltalem\u00e5let |trans-title=Dialect and normal speech |journal=Apollon |language=no |volume=1 |issn=0803-6926 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724185459/http://www.apollon.uio.no/vis/art/1998/1/dialekt |archivedate=24 July 2011}}</ref> Broadly speaking, Nynorsk writing is widespread in western Norway, though not in major urban areas, and also in the upper parts of mountain valleys in the southern and eastern parts of Norway. Examples are [[Setesdal]], the western part of [[Telemark]] county (''fylke'') and several municipalities in [[Hallingdal]], [[Valdres]], and [[Gudbrandsdalen]]. It is little used elsewhere, but 30\u201340 years ago, it also had strongholds in many rural parts of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] (mid-Norway) and the southern part of northern Norway ([[Nordland]] county). Today, not only is Nynorsk the official language of four of the 19 Norwegian counties, but also of many municipalities in five other counties. [[NRK]], the Norwegian broadcasting corporation, broadcasts in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, and all governmental agencies are required to support both written languages. Bokm\u00e5l is used in 92% of all written publications, and Nynorsk in 8% (2000).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nLike some other European countries, Norway has an official \"advisory board\"{{mdash}} [[Norwegian Language Council|Spr\u00e5kr\u00e5det]] (Norwegian Language Council){{mdash}} that determines, after approval from the Ministry of Culture, official spelling, grammar, and vocabulary for the Norwegian language. The board's work has been subject to considerable controversy throughout the years.\n\nBoth Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l have a great variety of optional forms. The Bokm\u00e5l that uses the forms that are close to Riksm\u00e5l is called ''moderate'' or ''conservative'', depending on one's viewpoint, while the Bokm\u00e5l that uses the forms that are close to Nynorsk is called ''radical''. Nynorsk has forms that are close to the original Landsm\u00e5l and forms that are close to Bokm\u00e5l.\n\n===Riksm\u00e5l===\n{{Main|Riksm\u00e5l}}\n[[File:M\u00e5lformer i Norge.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Map of the official language forms of Norwegian municipalities.

Riksm\u00e5l and conservative versions of Bokm\u00e5l have been the ''de facto'' standard written language of Norway for most of the 20th century, being used by large newspapers, encyclopedias, and a significant proportion of the population of the capital Oslo, surrounding areas, and other urban areas, as well as much of the literary tradition. Since the reforms of 1981 and 2003 (effective in 2005), the official Bokm\u00e5l can be adapted to be almost identical with modern Riksm\u00e5l. The differences between written Riksm\u00e5l and Bokm\u00e5l are comparable to [[American and British English differences]].\n\nRiksm\u00e5l is regulated by the [[Norwegian Academy]], which determines acceptable spelling, grammar, and vocabulary.\n\n===H\u00f8gnorsk===\n{{Main|H\u00f8gnorsk}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nThere is also an unofficial form of Nynorsk, called ''H\u00f8gnorsk'', discarding the post-1917 reforms, and thus close to Ivar Aasen's original Landsm\u00e5l. It is supported by [[Ivar Aasen-sambandet]], but has found no widespread use.\n\n===Current usage===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nIn 2010 86.5% of the pupils in the primary and lower secondary schools in Norway receive education in Bokm\u00e5l, while 13.0% receive education in Nynorsk. From the eighth grade onwards pupils are required to learn both. Out of the 431 municipalities in Norway, 161 have declared that they wish to communicate with the central authorities in Bokm\u00e5l, 116 (representing 12% of the population) in Nynorsk, while 156 are neutral. Of 4,549 state publications in 2000 8% were in Nynorsk, and 92% in Bokm\u00e5l. The large national newspapers ([[Aftenposten]], [[Dagbladet]], and [[Verdens Gang|VG]]) are published in Bokm\u00e5l or Riksm\u00e5l. Some major regional newspapers (including ''[[Bergens Tidende]]'' and ''[[Stavanger Aftenblad]]''), many political journals, and many local newspapers use both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk.\n\nA newer trend is to write in dialect for informal use. When writing an SMS, Facebook update, or fridge note, most younger people write the way they talk rather than using Bokm\u00e5l or Nynorsk.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Dialects==\n{{Main|Norwegian dialects}}\n[[File:Norske M\u00e5lgreiner.png|thumb|The map shows the division of the Norwegian dialects within the main groups.]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nThere is general agreement that a wide range of differences makes it difficult to estimate the number of different Norwegian dialects. Variations in grammar, syntax, vocabulary, and pronunciation cut across geographical boundaries and can create a distinct dialect at the level of farm clusters. Dialects are in some cases so dissimilar as to be unintelligible to unfamiliar listeners. Many linguists note a trend toward regionalization of dialects that diminishes the differences at such local levels; there is, however, a renewed interest in preserving dialects.\n\n==Examples==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nBelow are a few sentences giving an indication of the differences between Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, compared to the conservative (closer to Danish) form Riksm\u00e5l, Danish, as well as Old Norse, Swedish, Faroese, Icelandic (the living language grammatically closest to Old Norse), Old English and some modern West Germanic languages:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! width=\"100px\" | Language\n! colspan=\"4\" | Phrase\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[English language|Modern English]]\n! scope=\"col\" | I come from Norway\n! scope=\"col\" | What is his name?\n! scope=\"col\" | This is a horse\n! scope=\"col\" | The rainbow has many colours\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Danish language|Danish]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" | {{lang|da|'''Jeg kommer fra Norge'''}}\n| {{lang|da|Hvad hedder han?}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | {{lang|da|'''Dette er en hest'''}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{lang|da|'''Regnbuen har mange farver'''}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Riksm\u00e5l|Norwegian Riksm\u00e5l]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{lang|nb|'''Hva heter han?'''}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Bokm\u00e5l|Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l]]\n| {{lang|nb|'''Regnbuen har mange farger'''}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Nynorsk|Norwegian Nynorsk]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{lang|nn|'''{{Not a typo|Eg}} kjem fr\u00e5 Noreg'''}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{lang|nn|'''Kva heiter han?'''}}\n| {{lang|nn|'''Dette er ein hest'''}}\n| {{lang|nn|'''Regnbogen har mange fargar/leter'''}} <br/>= {{lang|nn|'''Regnbogen er mangleta'''}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[H\u00f8gnorsk|Norwegian H\u00f8gnorsk]]\n| {{lang|nn|'''Detta er ein hest'''}}\n| {{lang|nn|'''Regnbogen hev mange leter'''}} <br/>= {{lang|nn|'''Regnbogen er mangl\u00ecta'''}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Swedish language|Swedish]]\n| {{lang|sv|Jag kommer fr\u00e5n Norge}}\n| {{lang|sv|Vad heter han?}}\n| {{lang|sv|Detta \u00e4r en h\u00e4st}}\n| {{lang|sv|Regnb\u00e5gen har m\u00e5nga f\u00e4rger}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Old Norse]]\n| {{lang|non|Ek kem fr\u00e1 Noregi}}\n| {{lang|non|Hvat heitir hann?}}\n| {{lang|non|\u00deetta er hross}} /<br/>{{lang|non|\u00deessi er hestr}}\n| {{lang|non|Regnboginn er marglitr}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]\n| {{lang|is|\u00c9g kem fr\u00e1 Noregi}}\n| {{lang|is|Hva\u00f0 heitir hann?}}\n| {{lang|is|\u00deetta er hestur/hross}}\n| {{lang|is|Regnboginn er marglitur}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Faroese language|Faroese]]\n| {{lang|fo|{{Not a typo|Eg}} komi \u00far Noregi/Norra}}\n| {{lang|fo|Hvussu eitur hann?}}\n| {{lang|fo|Hetta er eitt ross / ein hestur}}\n| {{lang|fo|\u00c6labogin hevur n\u00f3gvar litir}} /<br/>{{lang|fo|\u00c6labogin er marglittur}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Old English]]\n| {{lang|ang|Ic cume fram Norwegan}}\n| {{lang|ang|Hwat h\u0101te\u00fe he?}}\n| {{lang|ang|\u00deis is hors}}\n| {{lang|ang|Regnboga h\u00e6f\u00f0 manige hiw}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[German language|German]]\n| {{lang|de|Ich komme aus Norwegen}}\n| {{lang|de|Wie hei\u00dft er?}}\n| {{lang|de|Das ist ein Pferd}}\n| {{lang|de|Der Regenbogen hat viele Farben}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Dutch language|Dutch]]\n| {{lang|nl|Ik kom uit Noorwegen}}\n| {{lang|nl|Hoe heet hij?}}\n| {{lang|nl|Dit is een paard}}\n| {{lang|nl|De regenboog heeft veel (vele) kleuren}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Afrikaans]]\n| {{lang|af|Ek kom van Noorwe\u00eb}}\n| {{lang|af|Wat is sy naam?}}<br/>{{lang|af|Hoe heet hy?}} (more archaic and formal)\n| {{lang|af|Dit is 'n perd}}\n| {{lang|af|Die re\u00ebnboog het baie kleure}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]\n| {{lang|fy|Ik kom \u00fat Noarwegen}}\n| {{lang|fy|Hoe hjit er?}}\n| {{lang|fy|Dit is in hynder}}\n| {{lang|fy|De reinb\u00f4ge hat in protte kleuren}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Low German|Low Saxon]]\n| {{lang|nds|Ik kom \u00fc\u00fct Noorwegen}}\n| {{lang|nds|Ho hit e?}}\n| {{lang|nds|Dit is een peerd}}\n| {{lang|nds|De regenboge hev v\u00f6le kl\u00f6ren}}\n|}\n\n==Grammar==\n===Nouns===\n{{See also|Nynorsk#Nouns}}\nNorwegian [[noun]]s are [[inflection|inflected]] for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular/plural) and for [[definiteness]] (indefinite/definite).

That is, all feminine nouns in Nynorsk must follow the prescribed inflection pattern above.\n\nThere is in general no way to infer what grammatical gender a specific noun has, but there are some patterns of nouns where the gender can be inferred. For instance, all nouns ending in -''nad'' will be masculine in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk (for instance the noun ''jobbs\u00f8knad'', which means job application). Most nouns ending in -''ing'' will be feminine, like the noun ''forventning'' (expectation).\n\nThere are some common irregular nouns, many of which are irregular in both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk, like the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Irregular noun, fot (foot)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ordbok.uib.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=fot&ant_bokmaal=5&ant_nynorsk=5&begge=+&ordbok=begge|title=Bokm\u00e5lsordboka {{!}} Nynorskordboka|website=ordbok.uib.no|access-date=2018-07-14}}</ref>\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" |Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural\n|-\n!\n!Indefinite\n!Definite\n!Indefinite\n!Definite\n|-\n|Bokm\u00e5l:\n|''en fot''\n|''foten''\n|''f\u00f8tter''\n|''f\u00f8ttene''\n|-\n|Nynorsk:\n|''ein fot''\n|''foten''\n|''f\u00f8ter''\n|''f\u00f8tene''\n|-\n|English:\n|a foot\n|the foot\n|feet\n|the feet\n|}\nIn Nynorsk, even though the irregular word ''fot'' is masculine, it is inflected like a feminine word in the plural. Another word with the same irregular inflection is ''son - s\u00f8ner'' (son - sons).\n\nIn Nynorsk, nouns ending in -''ing'' typically have masculine plural inflections, like the word ''dronning'' in the following table.

To show ownership, there is an enclitic -''s'' similar to English -{{'}}''s''; ''Sondres flotte bil'' (Sondre's nice car, Sondre being a personal name). There are also reflexive possessive pronouns, ''sin'', ''si'', ''sitt'', ''sine''; ''Det er Sondre sitt'' (It is Sondre's). In both Bokm\u00e5l and modern Nynorsk, there is often a mix of both of these to mark possession, though it is more common in Nynorsk to use the reflexive pronouns; in Nynorsk use of the reflexive possessive pronouns is generally encouraged to avoid mixing the enclitic -''s'' with the historical grammatical case remnants of the language.

''Han'' and ''hun'' refer to male and female individuals respectively, ''den'' and ''det'' refer to impersonal or inanimate nouns, of masculine/feminine or neutral gender respectively. In contrast, Nynorsk and most dialects use the same set of pronouns ''han'' (he), ''ho'' (she) and ''det'' (it) for both personal and impersonal references, just like in [[German language|German]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Old Norse]]. ''Det'' also has [[Syntactic expletive|expletive]] and [[cataphora|cataphoric]] uses like in the English examples '''''it''' rains'' and '''''it''' was known by everyone '''(that) he had travelled the world'''''.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Examples in Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l of the use of the pronoun \u00abit\u00bb\n\n!Nynorsk\n!Bokm\u00e5l\n!English\n|-\n|Kor er boka mi?

When there is no adjective, the most common word order is the one used in the examples in the table above, where the possessive comes after the noun, while the noun is in its definite form; \u00abboka mi\u00bb (my book). If one wishes to emphasize the owner of the noun, the possessive pronoun usually come first. In Bokm\u00e5l however, due to its Danish origins, one could choose to always write the possessive first \u00abmin bil\u00bb (my car), but this may sound very formal. Some dialects that have been very influenced by Danish do this too, some speakers in [[B\u00e6rum]] and the [[Oslo West|west of Oslo]] may always use this word order. When there is an adjective describing the noun, the possessive pronoun will always come first; \u00abmin egen bil\u00bb (my own car).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Norwegian (Bokm\u00e5l/Nynorsk)\n!English\n|-\n|Det er ''mi'' bok!\n|It is ''my'' book!

These are [[interjection]]s, [[grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]], [[grammatical conjunction|subjunctions]], [[preposition]]s, and [[adverbs]]. The inclusion of adverbs here requires that traditional adverbs that are inflected in [[Comparison (grammar)|comparison]] be classified as adjectives, as is sometimes done.\n\n==== Adverbs ====\n[[Adverb]]s can be formed from [[adjective]]s in Norwegian. English usually creates adverbs from adjectives by the suffix ''-ly,'' like the adverb ''beautifully'' from the adjective ''beautiful.'' By comparison, [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]] usually form adverbs from adjectives by the [[Neuter (grammar)|grammatical neuter]] singular form of the adjective. This is in general true for both Bokm\u00e5l and Nynorsk.\n\nExample ([[Bokm\u00e5l]]):\n\n* Han er ''grusom'' (He is ''terrible'')\n* Det er ''grusomt'' (It is terrible)\n* Han er ''grusomt'' treig (He is ''terribly'' slow)\n\nIn the third sentence, ''grusomt'' is an adverb. In the first and second sentence ''grusomt'' and ''grusom'' are adjectives and have to agree in grammatical gender with the noun.\n\nAnother example is the adjective ''vakker'' (beautiful) which exist in both Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l and has the neuter singular form ''vakkert.''\n\nExample ([[Nynorsk]]):\n\n* Ho er ''vakker'' (She is ''beautiful'') \n* Det er ''vakkert'' (It is ''beautiful'')\n* Ho syng ''vakkert'' (She sings ''beautifully)''\n\n===Compound words===\nIn Norwegian [[compound (linguistics)|compound words]], the [[head (linguistics)|head]], i.e. the part determining the compound's class, is the last part. If the compound word is constructed from many different nouns, the last noun in the compound noun will determine the gender of the compound noun. Only the first part has primary stress. For instance, the compound ''tenketank'' (think tank) has primary stress on the first syllable and is a masculine noun since the noun \u00abtank\u00bb is masculine.\n\nCompound words are written together in Norwegian, which can cause words to become very long, for example ''{{lang|no|sannsynlighetsmaksimeringsestimator}}'' ([[maximum likelihood]] [[estimator]]) and ''{{lang|no|menneskerettighetsorganisasjoner}}'' (human rights organizations). Other examples are the title ''h\u00f8yesterettsjustitiarius'' (Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, originally a combination of [[supreme court]] and the actual title, [[justiciar]]) and the translation ''En midtsommernattsdr\u00f8m'' for ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''.\n\nIf they are not written together, each part is naturally read with primary stress, and the meaning of the compound is lost. Examples of this in English are the difference between a green house and a greenhouse or a black board and a blackboard.\n\nThis is sometimes forgotten, occasionally with humorous results. Instead of writing, for example, ''{{lang|no|lammekoteletter}}'' (lamb chops), people make the mistake of writing ''{{lang|no|lamme koteletter}}'' (lame, or paralyzed, chops). The original message can even be reversed, as when ''{{lang|no|r\u00f8ykfritt}}'' (lit. \"smoke-free\" meaning no smoking) becomes ''{{lang|no|r\u00f8yk fritt}}'' (smoke freely).\n\nOther examples include:\n* ''Terrasse d\u00f8r'' (\"Terrace dies\") instead of ''Terrassed\u00f8r'' (\"Terrace door\")\n* ''Tunfisk biter'' (\"Tuna bites\", verb) instead of ''Tunfiskbiter'' (\"Tuna bits\", noun)\n* ''Smult ringer'' (\"Lard calls\", verb) instead of ''Smultringer'' (\"Doughnuts\")\n* ''Tyveri sikret'' (\"Theft guaranteed\") instead of ''Tyverisikret'' (\"Theft proof\")\n* ''Stekt kylling lever'' (\"Fried chicken lives\", verb) instead of ''Stekt kyllinglever'' (\"Fried chicken liver\", noun)\n* ''Sm\u00f8r br\u00f8d'' (\"Butter bread\", verb) instead of ''Sm\u00f8rbr\u00f8d'' (\"Sandwich\")\n* ''Klipp fisk'' (\"Cut fish\", verb) instead of ''Klippfisk'' (\"Clipfish\")\n* ''P\u00e5 hytte taket'' (\"On cottage the roof\") instead of ''P\u00e5 hyttetaket'' (\"On the cottage roof\")\n* ''Altfor Norge'' (\"Too Norway\") instead of ''Alt for Norge'' (\"Everything for Norway\", the royal motto of Norway)\nThese misunderstandings occur because most nouns can be interpreted as verbs or other types of words.\nSimilar misunderstandings can be achieved in English too. The following are examples of phrases that both in Norwegian and English mean one thing as a compound word, and something different when regarded as separate words:\n* ''stavekontroll'' (spellchecker) or ''stave kontroll'' (spell checker)\n* ''kokebok'' (cookbook) or ''koke bok'' (cook book)\n* ''ekte h\u00e5ndlagde vafler'' (real handmade waffles) or ''ekte h\u00e5nd lagde vafler'' (real hand made waffles)\n\n=== Syntax ===\nNorwegian syntax is predominantly [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]] with the subject of the sentence coming first, the verb coming second, and the object after that. However, like many other Germanic languages, it follows the [[V2 word order|V2 rule]], which means that the finite verb is invariably the second element in a sentence. For example:\n\n\u2022\"<u>Jeg</u> '''spiser''' fisk ''i dag''\" (<u>I</u> '''eat''' fish ''today'')\n\n\u2022\"''I dag'' '''spiser''' <u>jeg</u> fisk\" (''Today'', <u>I</u> '''eat''' fish)\n\n\u2022\"<u>Jeg</u> '''vil''' drikke kaffe ''i dag''\" (<u>I</u> '''want''' to drink coffee ''today'')\n\n\u2022\"''I dag'' '''vil''' <u>jeg</u> drikke kaffe\" (''Today'', <u>I</u> '''want''' to drink coffee)\n\nRegardless of which element is placed first, the finite verb comes second.\n\nAttributive adjectives always precede the noun that they modify.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\n[[File:Ambulanse Oslo Akershus 18jun2005.jpg|thumb|Norwegian ambulances changed their markings in 2005. This is the old appearance, with the Norwegian ''{{lang|no|ambulanse}}'', \"Ambulance.\"]]\nNorwegian vocabulary descends primarily from Old Norse. [[Middle Low German]] is the largest source of loanwords, having a marked influence on Norwegian vocabulary from the late Middle Ages onwards (in addition some impact on grammatical structures such as genitive constructions). Many of these loanwords, however, while found in Bokm\u00e5l and many dialects, are absent from Nynorsk, which retains or has substituted words derived from Old Norse. Nynorsk thus shares more vocabulary with Icelandic and Faroese than does Bokm\u00e5l.\n\nAt present, the main source of new loanwords is English e.g. ''rapper'', ''e-mail'', ''catering'', ''juice'', ''bag'' (itself possibly a loan word to English from Old Norse). Norwegian has also borrowed words and phrases from Danish and Swedish and continues to do so.\n\nThe spelling of some loanwords has been adapted to Norwegian orthographic conventions, but in general Norwegianised spellings have taken a long time to take hold. For example, ''{{lang|no|sj\u00e5f\u00f8r}}'' (from [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|chauffeur}}'') and ''{{lang|no|revansj}}'' (from French ''{{lang|fr|revanche}}'') are now the common Norwegian spellings, but ''juice'' is more often used than the Norwegianised form ''{{lang|no|jus}}'', ''catering'' more often than ''{{lang|no|keitering}}'', ''service'' more often than ''{{lang|no|s\u00f8rvis}}'', etc.\n\nIn the case of Danish and Swedish, the spelling in Norwegian of both loanwords and native cognates is often less conservative than the spelling in those languages, and, arguably, closer to the pronunciation. Four of the letters most shunned in Norwegian in comparison to the other Scandinavian languages are \"c\", \"d\", \"j\" and \"x\". Norwegian ''{{lang|no|hei}}'' is ''{{lang|sv|hej}}'' in Swedish and Danish; the words \"sex\" and \"six\" are ''{{lang|no|sex}}'' and ''{{lang|no|seks}}'' in Norwegian, but in Swedish they are both ''{{lang|sv|sex}}''; Danish words ending in ''{{lang|da|-tion}}'' end in ''{{lang|no|-sjon}}'' to reflect pronunciation and many traditional Danish spellings with ''d'' preceded by another consonant are changed to double consonants, such as in the Danish for water, ''{{lang|da|vand}}'', versus Norwegian (Bokm\u00e5l) spelling ''{{lang|nb|vann}}'', but \"sand\" is spelled ''{{lang|no|sand}}'' in both languages (Norwegian was standardized this way because in some dialects a \"d\" was pronounced in ''{{lang|no|sand}}'', whereas Norwegian speakers pronounced ''{{lang|no|vann}}'' without a \"d\"-sound). (The word for water in Nynorsk is ''{{lang|nn|vatn}}''.)\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Norway|Languages}}\n{{InterWiki|Main_Page=Hovedside|code=no|Bokm\u00e5l}}\n{{InterWiki|Main_Page=Hovudside|code=nn|Nynorsk}}\n{{wiktionary category}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Norwegian phrasebook|Norwegian|a phrasebook}}\n{{NIE Poster|year=1905|Norwegian Language}}\n\n* [[Differences between the Norwegian and Danish languages]]\n* [[Noregs M\u00e5llag]]\n* [[Norsk Ordbok (Nynorsk)|Norsk Ordbok]]\n* [[Det Norske Akademi for Sprog og Litteratur]]\n* [[Riksm\u00e5lsforbundet]]\n* [[Russenorsk]]\n* [[Tone (linguistics)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Philip Holmes (linguist)|Philip Holmes]], [[Hans-Olav Enger]], 'Norwegian.

Originally, the gang was set up to protect Salvadoran immigrants from other gangs in the Los Angeles area. Over time, the gang grew into a more traditional criminal organization. MS-13 is defined by its cruelty, and its rivalry with the [[18th Street Gang]].\n\nMany MS-13 members were deported to El Salvador after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992, or upon being arrested, facilitating the spread of the gang to Central America. The gang is currently active in many parts of the continental United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Most members are [[Central America]]n, Salvadorans in particular.\n\nAs an international gang, its history is closely tied to [[United States\u2013El Salvador relations]]. In 2018, the gang's US membership of up to 10,000 accounted for less than 1% of the 1.4 million gang members in the United States, and a similar share of gang murders. The gang is often referenced by the United States' [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to advocate for [[Opposition to immigration#United States|anti-immigrant policies]].\n\n== Description ==\n=== Etymology ===\nThere is some dispute about the etymology of the name. Some sources state the gang is named for La Mara, a street in [[San Salvador]], and the Salvatrucha guerrillas who fought in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apfn.org/APFN/MS-13.HTM|title=America's Most Dangerous Gang|author=Domash, Shelly Feuer|publisher=apfn.org}}</ref> Additionally, the word ''mara'' means gang in [[Central American Spanish|Caliche slang]] and is taken from ''[[Army ant|marabunta]]'', the name of a fierce type of ant. \"Salvatrucha\" may be a combination of the words ''Salvadoran'' and ''trucha'', a Caliche word for being alert. The term \"Salvatruchas\" has been explained as a reference to Salvadorian peasants trained to become guerrilla fighters, referred to as the \"[[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]].\" The \u201813\u2019 is believed to stand for the letter M, the thirteenth letter of the alphabet, but it is also been rumored to pay homage to a California prison gang, the Mexican Mafia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcspotlight.com/features/living-the-life/ms-13-gangs-infiltrating-the-suburbs-of-washington-dc/|title=MS-13: Gangs infiltrating the suburbs of Washington, DC|website=dcspotlight.com|publisher=DC Spotlight Newspaper|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614063408/https://dcspotlight.com/features/living-the-life/ms-13-gangs-infiltrating-the-suburbs-of-washington-dc/|archive-date=June 14, 2018|url-status=live|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Characteristics ===\n[[File:Mara_Salvatrucha_MS13.jpg|thumb|An MS [[Gang signal|gang sign]] and tattoos]]\nCentral Americans are the primary targets of violence and threats of violence by MS-13.<ref name=\"Rose\" /> Many of the victims are minors.<ref name=\"Demick\" /> Minors also make up the majority of suspects arrested for killings attributed to MS-13.

As such, Salvadorans began to immigrate without documents in increasing numbers. They mostly settled in cities with large undocumented populations, like Los Angeles. Salvadoran asylum claims were neglected until the 1991 case [[American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh (ABC) Settlement Agreement|American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh]]. The case's settlement agreement required Guatemalan and Salvadoran asylum claims to be reevaluated, as long as they had entered the U.S. by 1990. By this point, the Civil War was already drawing to a close after more than a decade of fighting. Before ABC v. Thornburg and even after, Salvadoran immigrants were left highly vulnerable to exploitation. In the very beginning, MS-13 was a group of young, delinquent, heavy metal fans who lived in Los Angeles. However, the undocumented community in Los Angeles was subject to severe racial prejudices and persecution. Under these conditions, MS-13 began to mutate into a gang. Originally, the gang's main purpose was to protect Salvadoran immigrants from the other, more established gangs of Los Angeles, who were predominantly composed of Mexicans, Asians, and African-Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/06/28/in-nva-gang-a-brutal-sense-of-belonging/3d85a511-9afb-4780-9368-12437e807394/|title=In N.Va.

Deras was a former member of Salvadoran special forces, [[Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation|trained in Panama by United States Green Berets]]. On gaining leadership of an MS-13 clique in 1990, he used his military training to discipline the gang and improve its logistical operations. It was after this point that the gang began to grow in power. MS-13's rivalry with the [[18th Street gang|18th Street Gang]] also began in this period. MS-13 and 18th Street were initially friendly, since they were some of the only gangs to allow Salvadorans to join. What exactly caused their alliance to fall apart is uncertain. Most versions point to a fight over a girl in 1989. In the incident, an MS-13 gangster was killed, which led to a cycle of vengeance that has escalated into an intense and generalized animosity between the two gangs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://salanegra.elfaro.net/es/201208/cronicas/9301/I-El-origen-del-odio.htm|title=I.

Large-scale deportations began shortly after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992. As a part of the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], the post-war Salvadoran government was required to stop using the standing army as a police force and form a new national police service. However, the ruling political party, [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]], was a descendant of the wartime military government. To favor military allies, it delayed the formation of the [[National Civil Police of El Salvador|Polic\u00eda Nacional Civil]]. When the PNC was finally organized 1993, parts of the police force were created by integrating the armed forces. Some of the members of the nascent police force were known war criminals. The lack of a proper police force meant that deported gangsters faced little opposition when establishing MS-13 in El Salvador. To compound the issue, the post-war period was marked by a large number of uncontrolled arms left over from the conflict, which allowed MS-13 to become a significant arms trafficker. This remains one of its primary revenue sources today, alongside other crimes like extortion and assassination.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Captured Peace Elites and Peacebuilding in El Salvador|author=Wade, Christine J.|date=2016|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=9780896802988|oclc=1020654434}}</ref> In addition, the economic struggles of the post-war period, alongside neoliberal trade reforms likely contributed to the growth of MS-13.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cultura y contra-cultura en la posmodernidad : el lenguaje en las maras centroamericanas|author=Maria Eugenia Rojas Rodriguez|date=2008|publisher=Alma Mater|oclc=912767426}}</ref>\n\n=== Opposition ===\nGang violence in El Salvador peaked in the 1990s, then declined in the early 2000s. Even so, they became a key part of political discourse. ARENA presidencies implemented the [[La Mano Dura|Mano Dura and Super Mano Dura]] policies to combat gangs. External observers and gangsters themselves believe these policies increased the power of gangs in El Salvador.\n\nThe Mano Dura policies were followed by a truce between MS-13 and their perpetual rivals, the 18th Street Gang. Under the direction of the president [[Mauricio Funes]], the first Salvadoran President representing the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front|FMLN]] party, government and gang representatives negotiated unofficially.  The terms required gangs to lower the homicide rate in exchange for transfers to lower security prisons.  In addition, gangs would receive benefits from the government for every firearm they surrendered. While homicides fell during the truce, gangs no longer had to worry as much about turf wars. Instead, they focused on recruitment, organization, and extortion. The truce did not protect most Salvadorans from extortion. This, along with reports of government leniency towards imprisoned gangsters, led to the truce being highly unpopular and controversial.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFunes's successor as the FMLN presidential candidate, [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]], campaigned on returning to a tough approach on gangs. After S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n took the Presidency in 2014, the truce was understood to be over. Since the gang truce ended, the number of extrajudicial killings by police forces has grown dramatically.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-violence-idUSKBN1FQ0E1|title=U.N. finds possible extrajudicial killings in El Salvador gang...|date=2018-02-06|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-12-06|language=en}}</ref>  Throughout the truce, Salvadoran gangs were able to focus on expansion and internal regulation instead of inter-gang conflict.  When the truce ended, the gangs had built up their forces significantly. As such, the truce breakdown saw a return to record levels of violence, with the gangs being much stronger and better organized than before. In 2015, El Salvador had the highest national homicide rate per capita in the world, largely due to escalating violence between MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang. Participants in the original truce negotiations have since been prosecuted. The trials revealed significant corruption, such as government negotiators encouraging gangs to increase the homicide rate to keep everyone at the negotiating table.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2017/08/26/traducing-el-salvadors-truce|title=Traducing El Salvador's truce|date=2017-08-26|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-12-06|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\nOpposition to MS-13 in the U.S. has taken varied forms.

Originally, the gang was set up to protect Salvadoran immigrants from other gangs in the Los Angeles area. Over time, the gang grew into a more traditional criminal organization. MS-13 is defined by its cruelty, and its rivalry with the [[18th Street Gang]].\n\nMany MS-13 members were deported to El Salvador after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992, or upon being arrested, facilitating the spread of the gang to Central America. The gang is currently active in many parts of the continental United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Most members are [[Central America]]n, Salvadorans in particular.\n\nAs an international gang, its history is closely tied to [[United States\u2013El Salvador relations]]. In 2018, the gang's US membership of up to 10,000 accounted for less than 1% of the 1.4 million gang members in the United States, and a similar share of gang murders. The gang is often referenced by the United States' [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to advocate for [[Opposition to immigration#United States|anti-immigrant policies]].\n\n== Description ==\n=== Etymology ===\nThere is some dispute about the etymology of the name. Some sources state the gang is named for La Mara, a street in [[San Salvador]], and the Salvatrucha guerrillas who fought in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apfn.org/APFN/MS-13.HTM|title=America's Most Dangerous Gang|author=Domash, Shelly Feuer|publisher=apfn.org}}</ref> Additionally, the word ''mara'' means gang in [[Central American Spanish|Caliche slang]] and is taken from ''[[Army ant|marabunta]]'', the name of a fierce type of ant. \"Salvatrucha\" may be a combination of the words ''Salvadoran'' and ''trucha'', a Caliche word for being alert. The term \"Salvatruchas\" has been explained as a reference to Salvadorian peasants trained to become guerrilla fighters, referred to as the \"[[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front]].\" The \u201813\u2019 is believed to stand for the letter M, the thirteenth letter of the alphabet, but it is also been rumored to pay homage to a California prison gang, the Mexican Mafia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcspotlight.com/features/living-the-life/ms-13-gangs-infiltrating-the-suburbs-of-washington-dc/|title=MS-13: Gangs infiltrating the suburbs of Washington, DC|website=dcspotlight.com|publisher=DC Spotlight Newspaper|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614063408/https://dcspotlight.com/features/living-the-life/ms-13-gangs-infiltrating-the-suburbs-of-washington-dc/|archive-date=June 14, 2018|url-status=live|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Characteristics ===\n[[File:Mara_Salvatrucha_MS13.jpg|thumb|An MS [[Gang signal|gang sign]] and tattoos]]\nCentral Americans are the primary targets of violence and threats of violence by MS-13.<ref name=\"Rose\" /> Many of the victims are minors.<ref name=\"Demick\" /> Minors also make up the majority of suspects arrested for killings attributed to MS-13.

As such, Salvadorans began to immigrate without documents in increasing numbers. They mostly settled in cities with large undocumented populations, like Los Angeles. Salvadoran asylum claims were neglected until the 1991 case [[American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh (ABC) Settlement Agreement|American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh]]. The case's settlement agreement required Guatemalan and Salvadoran asylum claims to be reevaluated, as long as they had entered the U.S. by 1990. By this point, the Civil War was already drawing to a close after more than a decade of fighting. Before ABC v. Thornburg and even after, Salvadoran immigrants were left highly vulnerable to exploitation. In the very beginning, MS-13 was a group of young, delinquent, heavy metal fans who lived in Los Angeles. However, the undocumented community in Los Angeles was subject to severe racial prejudices and persecution. Under these conditions, MS-13 began to mutate into a gang. Originally, the gang's main purpose was to protect Salvadoran immigrants from the other, more established gangs of Los Angeles, who were predominantly composed of Mexicans, Asians, and African-Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2004/06/28/in-nva-gang-a-brutal-sense-of-belonging/3d85a511-9afb-4780-9368-12437e807394/|title=In N.Va.

Deras was a former member of Salvadoran special forces, [[Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation|trained in Panama by United States Green Berets]]. On gaining leadership of an MS-13 clique in 1990, he used his military training to discipline the gang and improve its logistical operations. It was after this point that the gang began to grow in power. MS-13's rivalry with the [[18th Street gang|18th Street Gang]] also began in this period. MS-13 and 18th Street were initially friendly, since they were some of the only gangs to allow Salvadorans to join. What exactly caused their alliance to fall apart is uncertain. Most versions point to a fight over a girl in 1989. In the incident, an MS-13 gangster was killed, which led to a cycle of vengeance that has escalated into an intense and generalized animosity between the two gangs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://salanegra.elfaro.net/es/201208/cronicas/9301/I-El-origen-del-odio.htm|title=I.

Large-scale deportations began shortly after the close of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] in 1992. As a part of the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]], the post-war Salvadoran government was required to stop using the standing army as a police force and form a new national police service. However, the ruling political party, [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]], was a descendant of the wartime military government. To favor military allies, it delayed the formation of the [[National Civil Police of El Salvador|Polic\u00eda Nacional Civil]]. When the PNC was finally organized 1993, parts of the police force were created by integrating the armed forces. Some of the members of the nascent police force were known war criminals. The lack of a proper police force meant that deported gangsters faced little opposition when establishing MS-13 in El Salvador. To compound the issue, the post-war period was marked by a large number of uncontrolled arms left over from the conflict, which allowed MS-13 to become a significant arms trafficker. This remains one of its primary revenue sources today, alongside other crimes like extortion and assassination.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Captured Peace Elites and Peacebuilding in El Salvador|author=Wade, Christine J.|date=2016|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=9780896802988|oclc=1020654434}}</ref> In addition, the economic struggles of the post-war period, alongside neoliberal trade reforms likely contributed to the growth of MS-13.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cultura y contra-cultura en la posmodernidad : el lenguaje en las maras centroamericanas|author=Maria Eugenia Rojas Rodriguez|date=2008|publisher=Alma Mater|oclc=912767426}}</ref>\n\n=== Opposition ===\nGang violence in El Salvador peaked in the 1990s, then declined in the early 2000s. Even so, they became a key part of political discourse. ARENA presidencies implemented the [[La Mano Dura|Mano Dura and Super Mano Dura]] policies to combat gangs. External observers and gangsters themselves believe these policies increased the power of gangs in El Salvador.\n\nThe Mano Dura policies were followed by a truce between MS-13 and their perpetual rivals, the 18th Street Gang. Under the direction of the president [[Mauricio Funes]], the first Salvadoran President representing the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front|FMLN]] party, government and gang representatives negotiated unofficially.  The terms required gangs to lower the homicide rate in exchange for transfers to lower security prisons.  In addition, gangs would receive benefits from the government for every firearm they surrendered. While homicides fell during the truce, gangs no longer had to worry as much about turf wars. Instead, they focused on recruitment, organization, and extortion. The truce did not protect most Salvadorans from extortion. This, along with reports of government leniency towards imprisoned gangsters, led to the truce being highly unpopular and controversial.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFunes's successor as the FMLN presidential candidate, [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]], campaigned on returning to a tough approach on gangs. After S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n took the Presidency in 2014, the truce was understood to be over. Since the gang truce ended, the number of extrajudicial killings by police forces has grown dramatically.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-violence-idUSKBN1FQ0E1|title=U.N. finds possible extrajudicial killings in El Salvador gang...|date=2018-02-06|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-12-06|language=en}}</ref>  Throughout the truce, Salvadoran gangs were able to focus on expansion and internal regulation instead of inter-gang conflict.  When the truce ended, the gangs had built up their forces significantly. As such, the truce breakdown saw a return to record levels of violence, with the gangs being much stronger and better organized than before. In 2015, El Salvador had the highest national homicide rate per capita in the world, largely due to escalating violence between MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang. Participants in the original truce negotiations have since been prosecuted. The trials revealed significant corruption, such as government negotiators encouraging gangs to increase the homicide rate to keep everyone at the negotiating table.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2017/08/26/traducing-el-salvadors-truce|title=Traducing El Salvador's truce|date=2017-08-26|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-12-06|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\nOpposition to MS-13 in the U.S. has taken varied forms.

Torres tipped authorities to the plan after he and four MS-13 members were stopped by [[NYPD]] detectives for hassling passersby on Northern Boulevard in [[Queens, New York|Queens]], New York. He told police he had information to pass on; he was debriefed on October 22 at [[Rikers Island]], where he was being held on a warrant issued in Virginia, according to court papers. Torres said \"the order for the murder came from gang leadership in El Salvador\", ICE agent Sean Sweeney wrote in an affidavit for a new warrant charging Torres with conspiracy. Torres, who belonged to an MS-13 \"clique\" in Virginia, said he was put in charge, and traveled to New York in August \"for the specific purpose of participating in the planning and execution of the murder plot\", Sweeney wrote. Gang members were trying to obtain a high-powered rifle to penetrate the agent's bulletproof vest. Another MS-13 informant told authorities the agent was marked for death because the gang was \"exceedingly angry\" at him for arresting many members in the past three years, the affidavit states. The murder was supposed to be carried out by the Flushing clique, according to the informant. Federal prosecutors have indicted numerous MS-13 gang members on racketeering, extortion, prostitution, kidnapping, illegal immigration, money laundering, murder, people smuggling, arms trafficking, human trafficking and drug trafficking charges; the targeted special agent was the lead federal investigator on many of the federal cases.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/11/04/2009-11-04_ms13_gang_puts_out_hit_on_fbi_agent_assigned_to_crackdown.html|title=MS-13 gang leaders puts out hit on ICE agent assigned to crackdown|last1=Marzulli|first1=John|date=November 4, 2009|work=Daily News|accessdate=June 9, 2012|publisher=NYDailyNews.com}}</ref>\n[[File:Sinaloa Cartel Hierarchy.JPG|thumb|Sinaloa Cartel hierarchy in early 2008]]\n\nIn August 2011, six San Francisco MS-13 members were convicted of racketeering and conspiracy, including three murders, in what was the city's largest-scope gang trial in many years.

For non-indoor events, boats are separated into ''Championship'' (where \"BUCS points\" are available), ''Intermediate'' and ''Beginner'' (for students in their first year of the sport).\n\nOn 16 June 2008, UCS (who represented the professional staff working in the sector) and BUSA (the body for competitive sport in the sector) merged to form \"BUCS\" \u2013 British Universities and Colleges Sport. Events from 2008/09 onwards therefore come under the BUCS banner, rather than BUSA, e.g. BUCS Regatta rather than BUSA regatta.\n\nBUCS events contribute \"BUCS Points\" (for ''Championship'' boats) towards the (multi-sport) BUCS championship. Since 2011\u201312, a breakdown of points by sport has also been available.

It has a population of 24,000. '''Bushey Heath''' is a large neighbourhood south east of Bushey on the boundary with the [[London Borough of Harrow]] reaching elevations of {{convert|165|m}} above sea level.<ref>OS Explorer Map 173, 2010 edition</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first written record of Bushey is an account in the [[Domesday Book]], which describes a small agricultural village named 'Bissei' (which later became 'Biss(h)e' and then 'Bisheye' during the 12th century). However, chance archaeological findings of [[Stone Age]] tools provide evidence that the area was inhabited as far back as the [[Palaeolithic]] period. The town also has links to the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] occupation of [[Great Britain|Britain]], with the main road running through it being Roman; sites of possible Roman villas being unearthed in the area; and a Roman tessellated pavement was discovered near Chiltern Avenue.<ref>{{PastScape|mnumber=398249 |mname=|accessdate= 27 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Saint James Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]]'s Church, Bushey]]\nThe origin of the town's name is not fully known. In terms of the original name, \"Bissei,\" an early theory in Reverend J.B. Johnstone's book ''The Place-Names of England and Wales'' states that it may have meant \"Byssa's Isle,\" and it started life as a lake-village surrounded by marshes, streams and lakes.  A more modern theory (but less romantic) is that it is simply derived from the Old English word ''bysce'' and Old French ''boisseie'', meaning a 'place covered with wood'. The latter theory could prove more apt, as the town is located in the valleys which extend southwards from the [[Chiltern Hills]], which were once covered in dense forests of [[oak]], [[elm]], [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[hazel]] and [[juniper]].\n\nBushey Heath's story begins in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] during a large food shortage. To help solve the problem, the government awarded the waste land to the east of Bushey to Bushey landowners to be used as farming; the land was more generally known as Bushey Common. Whilst the original aim was to produce food, being close to a railway and up to 500&nbsp;ft above sea level with beautiful and broad views made the area attractive for housing developers.\n\nThe 19th and 20th centuries marked the time of most change in Bushey, especially between 1860 and 1960. The population rose 28-fold within 200 years, from 856 in 1801, to just under 24,000 today. The expansion was for many reasons, one of the main ones being due to the boom in industry caused by the railway in the early 20th century. A result was that many new jobs were created in and around [[Watford]], and in the early 1920s, Bushey's first council houses were built. More housing was later built for the service families working in defence organisations in [[Stanmore]] and [[Northwood, London|Northwood]]. The expansion eventually died down because much of the land in and around Bushey was protected under the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] after the [[Second World War]].\n\nThis same Green Belt legislation was also partly responsible for the abandonment of the pre-war [[Edgware tube station|Edgware]] to [[Bushey Heath tube station|Bushey Heath]] extension as part of the [[Northern line#The Northern Heights plan|Northern Heights]] programme of the [[Northern line]] underground railway. The [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] put great restrictions on new development, and the plan was to use the new railway to stimulate new housing around the new route; without the new housing the route was deemed no longer viable. However, as work was advanced at the onset of war, the depot was completed for use as bomber manufacture, and following the Second World War and Green Belt coming into force, it was converted into the [[Aldenham]] bus depot (of [[Cliff Richard]]'s ''[[Summer Holiday (1963 film)|Summer Holiday]]'' fame), which it remained until 1985, when it became derelict. It was redeveloped in 1996 and is now the Centennial Park Industrial Estate ({{coord|51.639954|-0.308561|source:google|display=inline}}). [[Bushey Heath tube station|Bushey Heath station]] would have been located at the intersection of Elstree Road and [[A41 road|Northwestern Avenue]] ({{coord|51.64245|-0.3200|source:Google|display=inline}}). Conceptual plans existed in the 1903 [[Act of Parliament]] for an [[Edgware]] to [[Watford]] railway that would have seen the railway extended at a later date though Bushey village and on to Watford market, but even less came of that than the partially completed [[Edgware tube station|Edgware]] to [[Bushey Heath tube station|Bushey Heath]] stretch.\n\nThe highest point in the historic county of [[Middlesex]] was in Bushey Heath on the border between Hertfordshire and Middlesex at the junction of the A4140 and the A409. At 153&nbsp;m (502&nbsp;ft) above sea level, the grid reference was TQ 152937.\n\n===Stories, legends and folklore===\nThe lack of farming in Bushey Heath meant that it was a heavily wooded area up to the 18th century, and this, added to the lack of street lighting and police, meant that Bushey Heath's history is full of tales of thieves, highwaymen and even murder. According to Grant Longman's ''Robberies on Bushey Heath'', the road from Bushey Heath to [[Stanmore]] is said to be where the highwaymen lurked, ready to raid the dozen or so caravans that passed through Bushey Heath daily, carrying money from trade in London. Before venturing through the pass, parties of travellers and merchants would form at the ''Boot Inn'' at [[Edgware]] and the ''Three Crowns'' at Bushey Heath so they did not have to venture through the pass alone. Although one of the highwaymen responsible for the attacks is rumoured to have been the notorious [[Dick Turpin]], evidence suggests that he was in fact more active in the region of [[Essex]].\n\n==Local government==\n\nBushey was an ancient [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]]. It was subdivided by the [[Local Government Act 1894]] into two: the part which was within the [[Watford]] urban district became the 'Bushey Urban' parish, in the [[Watford Rural District]], and the part which was outside became 'Bushey Rural' parish. Subsequently, in 1906, the Bushey Urban parish was renamed [[Oxhey]], and the Bushey Rural parish became the parish of Bushey in the Bushey Urban District.\n\n==Modern day==\n[[Image:Bushey High Street 2.jpg|thumb|High Street, Bushey]]\n\nDespite being close to London and having Watford on its doorstep Bushey retains the feeling of a small town and this is reinforced with events such as the [[Bushey Festival]] and quarter marathon which is held each July and the Horticultural Society's flower and produce show.\n\nBeing located near several film [[Elstree Studios|studios at Elstree and Borehamwood]], Bushey and Bushey Heath frequently feature as backdrops for many film and TV shows. Most notable is a bus scene in the ''[[Cannon and Ball]]'' film, and in the 1957 film ''[[Lucky Jim]]''. Several historic buildings in Bushey, notably the old [[Royal Masonic School for Boys]], later the International University, in the Avenue, have been used in films over a long period of time, including, ''[[Nuns on the Run]]'', ''[[Out of Bounds (2003 film)|Out of Bounds]]'', ''[[Children of Men]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter]]''. and also the comedy series ''[[Little Britain]]''. It has also been the set for several television series, including ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' and ''[[Little Britain]]''. This site is currently being redeveloped for residential usage, with the 1960s additions to the site having been demolished.\n\nMany of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' episodes include location shots around the Bushey area, and the latter half of the ''[[Confessions of a Driving Instructor]]'' is entirely shot on the roads between Elstree and Bushey, finishing in the car dump at 'Bushey Breakers'.\n\nThe [[University of London]], located in the Bushey area has been used in the filming of BBC's [[Grange Hill]] and also for various other programmes, such as [[family business]]. Pupils from local schools including [[Bushey Hall School|Bushey Hall]] and [[Bushey Meads School|Bushey Meads]] have taken part as extras in productions such as ''[[My Dad's the Prime Minister]]''.\n\nBushey Heath is home to a duck pond, (Warren Lake) which was restored in 1992 after falling into dereliction.\n\n==Schools==\nThe area contains a mix of primary schools and linked infants and junior schools (see [[Primary schools in Hertsmere#Bushey|schools in Bushey]]).\n\nThe state secondary schools are [[Queens' School, Hertfordshire|Queens' School]], [[Bushey Meads School]] and [[Bushey Academy]] (also known as Bushey Hall), of which the first two generally do well in comparison with other schools in the county. Bushey is also the site of the famous [[Purcell School]], a school for young musicians well known for turning out many successful musicians. It was formerly the [[Royal Caledonian School]]. There are also two private girls' schools, St. Hilda's and [[St Margaret's School, Bushey|St Margaret's]] in the area.\n\n==Herkomer's Art School==\n\nHubert Herkomer was a poor immigrant from [[Bavaria]], who moved to Bushey in 1874, and ended life in 1914 as [[Hubert von Herkomer|Sir Hubert von Herkomer]] [[Royal Academy|RA]] [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]]. Herkomer had visited a friend who lived in Bushey in 1873, and returned to rent a pair of cottages and a studio near Melbourne Road. He founded Herkomer's Art School at Bushey in 1883, which, in its 21-year life, attracted some 500 students to the area, some of whom stayed after establishing their own studios. Their paintings are on display in the [[Bushey Museum]]. A street, Herkomer Road, was named in his memory.\n\nAt around 1888, he built [[Lululaund]] ({{coord|51.643908|-0.36065|display=inline}}), a 'Bavarian castle', which was named after his second wife Lulu Griffiths. After being married for only a year she died. Lululaund dominated the Bushey skyline until 1939 when it was almost entirely demolished; a lot of the building was used as hardcore for [[RAF Bovingdon|Bovingdon Airfield]], and much of the woodwork and carvings from the castle were burnt.\n\nIn 2014 the surviving remnant of Lululaund was converted into luxury apartments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hertsmere.gov.uk/environmentplanning/parksandopenspaces/busheyrosegarden_3/latestupdates.jsp |title=Bushey Rose Garden, Latest News |publisher=Hertsmere Council |accessdate=15 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418164353/http://www.hertsmere.gov.uk/environmentplanning/parksandopenspaces/busheyrosegarden_3/latestupdates.jsp |archivedate=18 April 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hertsmere.gov.uk/environmentplanning/parksandopenspaces/busheyrosegarden_3/history.jsp |title=The History of the Rose Garden |publisher=Hertsmere Council |accessdate=15 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422000804/http://www.hertsmere.gov.uk/environmentplanning/parksandopenspaces/busheyrosegarden_3/history.jsp |archivedate=22 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nSir Hubert is mainly remembered as an artist today, but in his time he was a polymath, becoming involved in some of the earliest film productions in Europe, and starting a series of races and time trials for cars in Germany.\n\nIn 1904 Herkomer closed his school and sold the building.

Work started in September 2017 and the railway continues to grow. The railway is 5 inch (so big enough to take adults and children) and 90 meters long. The railway runs a battery electric locomotive and various passenger carriages and is located in the large garden of an old Georgian house in the high street. The Bushey Miniature Railway is a private railway at the moment, with plans to operate for visitors on open days in the Spring and Summer.\n\n==Film studios==\n{{Main|Bushey Studios}}\nBushey Film Studios in Melbourne Road were originally built by Hubert Herkomer and operated between 1913 and 1985. For much of its existence the studios focused on low-budget productions.\n\n==Jewish cemeteries==\nThere are two [[Jewish cemetery|Jewish cemeteries]], serving a sector of north-west London. Bushey 'Old' Cemetery is at Little Bushey Lane and Bushey 'New' Cemetery is {{convert|600|m}} along the same road.

It has a population of 24,000. '''Bushey Heath''' is a large neighbourhood south east of Bushey on the boundary with the [[London Borough of Harrow]] reaching elevations of {{convert|165|m}} above sea level.<ref>OS Explorer Map 173, 2010 edition</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first written record of Bushey is an account in the [[Domesday Book]], which describes a small agricultural village named 'Bissei' (which later became 'Biss(h)e' and then 'Bisheye' during the 12th century). However, chance archaeological findings of [[Stone Age]] tools provide evidence that the area was inhabited as far back as the [[Palaeolithic]] period. The town also has links to the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] occupation of [[Great Britain|Britain]], with the main road running through it being Roman; sites of possible Roman villas being unearthed in the area; and a Roman tessellated pavement was discovered near Chiltern Avenue.<ref>{{PastScape|mnumber=398249 |mname=|accessdate= 27 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Saint James Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]]'s Church, Bushey]]\nThe origin of the town's name is not fully known. In terms of the original name, \"Bissei,\" an early theory in Reverend J.B. Johnstone's book ''The Place-Names of England and Wales'' states that it may have meant \"Byssa's Isle,\" and it started life as a lake-village surrounded by marshes, streams and lakes.  A more modern theory (but less romantic) is that it is simply derived from the Old English word ''bysce'' and Old French ''boisseie'', meaning a 'place covered with wood'. The latter theory could prove more apt, as the town is located in the valleys which extend southwards from the [[Chiltern Hills]], which were once covered in dense forests of [[oak]], [[elm]], [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[hazel]] and [[juniper]].\n\nBushey Heath's story begins in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] during a large food shortage. To help solve the problem, the government awarded the waste land to the east of Bushey to Bushey landowners to be used as farming; the land was more generally known as Bushey Common. Whilst the original aim was to produce food, being close to a railway and up to 500&nbsp;ft above sea level with beautiful and broad views made the area attractive for housing developers.\n\nThe 19th and 20th centuries marked the time of most change in Bushey, especially between 1860 and 1960. The population rose 28-fold within 200 years, from 856 in 1801, to just under 24,000 today. The expansion was for many reasons, one of the main ones being due to the boom in industry caused by the railway in the early 20th century. A result was that many new jobs were created in and around [[Watford]], and in the early 1920s, Bushey's first council houses were built. More housing was later built for the service families working in defence organisations in [[Stanmore]] and [[Northwood, London|Northwood]].

Mawson]].<ref name=rose>{{cite web|title=Bushey Rose Garden|url=http://www.hertsmere.gov.uk/Parks--Leisure/Parks--Open-Spaces/Bushey-Rose-Garden/History-and-Restoration.aspx|website=Parks and Leisure|publisher=Hertsmere Borough Council|accessdate=24 August 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140824070036/http://www.hertsmere.gov.uk/Parks--Leisure/Parks--Open-Spaces/Bushey-Rose-Garden/History-and-Restoration.aspx|archivedate=24 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is listed grade II on the [[Register of Parks and Gardens]].<ref name=\"HE\">{{NHLE |num=1001649 |desc=Rose Garden, Bushey |accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThere is a gallery named after Kemp-Welch close to the village church. It is more usually used as a village hall today, with occasional exhibitions such as one in September 2006 by students from the [[Chelsea College of Art]].\n\n==Bushey Miniature Railway==\nBushey Miniature Railway is a fairly recent addition to Bushey village. Work started in September 2017 and the railway continues to grow. The railway is 5 inch (so big enough to take adults and children) and 90 meters long. The railway runs a battery electric locomotive and various passenger carriages and is located in the large garden of an old Georgian house in the high street. The Bushey Miniature Railway is a private railway at the moment, with plans to operate for visitors on open days in the Spring and Summer.\n\n==Film studios==\n{{Main|Bushey Studios}}\nBushey Film Studios in Melbourne Road were originally built by Hubert Herkomer and operated between 1913 and 1985. For much of its existence the studios focused on low-budget productions.\n\n==Jewish cemeteries==\nThere are two [[Jewish cemetery|Jewish cemeteries]], serving a sector of north-west London. Bushey 'Old' Cemetery is at Little Bushey Lane and Bushey 'New' Cemetery is {{convert|600|m}} along the same road. Both are active for funerals, stone-settings and visiting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theus.org.uk/article/bushey-cemetery|title=Bushey Cemetery &#124; United Synagogue|website=www.theus.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 a \u00a36.12 m extension was built, as the 43,000 grave spaces in the old cemetery were nearly full, and another 17,000 were thought necessary to provide for the next 50 years. {{convert|16|acre}} of new land were laid out by the landscape architects J and L Gibbons, with two prayer halls, offices and a mortuary. There are also separate rooms for the [[Cohanim]], who are not permitted to be in the same space as the coffin, but may view proceedings through glass walls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/07/bushey-jewish-cemetery-extension-review|title=Bushey Jewish Cemetery review \u2013 a place of dignity and ease|first=Rowan|last=Moore|date=7 January 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- *** Please remember to add the Category:People from Bushey to the page of anybody you add to this list *** -->\n{{div col |colwidth=30em}}\n*[[George Michael]], musician, [[Wham!]], attended Bushey Meads School\n*[[Andrew Ridgeley]], musician, [[Wham!]], attended Bushey Meads School\n*[[R.

Its title is derived from the [[Incipit|first word]] of the [[Koine Greek]] text: ''apokalypsis'', meaning \"unveiling\" or \"revelation\" (before title pages and titles, books were commonly known by their incipit (first words), as is also the case with the Hebrew ''[[Torah]]''). The Book of Revelation is the only [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic document]] in the New Testament [[Biblical canon|canon]] (although there are short apocalyptic passages in various places in [[the Gospels]] and the [[Epistles]], and an extended apocalyptic passage in the [[Book of Daniel]] in the [[Old Testament]]).{{Efn|Other apocalypses popular in the [[early Christian]] era did not achieve canonical status, except [[2 Esdras]] (also known as the Apocalypse of Ezra), which is recognized as canonical in [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] churches.}} Thus, it occupies a central place in [[Christian eschatology]].\n\nThe author names himself as \"John\" in the text, but his precise identity remains a point of academic debate. Second-century Christian writers such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Melito]] (the bishop of Sardis), [[Clement of Alexandria]], and the author of the [[Muratorian fragment]] identify [[John the Apostle]] as the \"John\" of Revelation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carson|first=Don|title=An Introduction to the New Testament|date=2005|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=978-0-310-51940-9|pages=465ff|edition=2nd}}</ref> Modern scholarship generally takes a different view,{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=28}} with many considering that nothing can be known about the author except that he was a Christian prophet.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2}} Some modern scholars characterize Revelation's author as a putative figure whom they call \"[[John of Patmos]]\". The bulk of traditional sources date the book to the reign of the Roman emperor [[Domitian]] (AD 81\u201396), which evidence tends to confirm.{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|pp=1535\u20131536}}{{efn|However, among recent writers, John Behr<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6u-MDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=john+behr+paschal+gospel&hl=en&ppis=_c&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjM9PTv8K3oAhWndN8KHa_GAFUQ6AEwAXoECAUQAg#v=onepage&q=john%20behr%20paschal%20gospel&f=false|title=John the Theologian and his Paschal Gospel|last=Behr|first=John|date=2019|location=Oxford}}</ref> argues that Irenaeus and the earliest traditions of the church placed the writing in the reign of Nero.}}\n\nThe book spans three literary genres: the [[letter (message)|epistolary]], the [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]], and the [[prophetic]].{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|p=1536}} It begins with John, on the island of [[Patmos]] in the [[Aegean Sea]], addressing a letter to the \"[[Seven Churches of Asia]]\". He then describes a series of prophetic [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]], including of figures such as the Seven-Headed Dragon, [[Serpents in the Bible#Ancient serpent|the Serpent]], and [[The Beast (Revelation)|the Beast]], which culminate in the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]].\n\nThe obscure and extravagant imagery has led to a wide variety of Christian interpretations. [[Historicism (Christianity)|Historicist]] interpretations see Revelation as containing a broad view of history, whilst [[preterist]] interpretations treat Revelation as mostly referring to the events of the [[Apostolic Age]] (1st century), or, at the latest, the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Futurism (Christianity)|Futurists]], meanwhile, believe that Revelation describes future events, with the seven churches growing into the body/believers throughout the age, and a reemergence or continuous rule of a Roman/Graeco system with modern capabilities described by John in ways familiar to him, and [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|idealist or symbolic]] interpretations consider that Revelation does not refer to actual people or events, but is an [[allegory]] of the spiritual path and the ongoing struggle between good and evil.\n\n== Composition and setting ==\n[[File:Johannes op Patmos Saint John on Patmos Berlin, Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin, Gemaldegalerie HR.jpg|thumb|''[[St. John the Evangelist on Patmos]]'' by [[Hieronymous Bosch]], circa 1489]]\n\n=== Title, authorship, and date ===\n[[File:ApocalypseStSeverFol026vJohnRecievesRev.jpg|thumb|St. John receives his Revelation. [[Saint-Sever Beatus]], 11th century.]]\n{{Main|Authorship of the Johannine works}}\nThe name ''Revelation'' comes from the [[Incipit|first word]] of the book in [[Koine Greek]]: \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 (''apokalypsis''), which means \"unveiling\" or \"revelation\". The author names himself as \"John\", but modern scholars consider it unlikely that the author of Revelation also wrote the [[Gospel of John]]. [[Dionysius of Alexandria]] set out some of the evidence for this view as early as the second half of the third century, noting that the gospel and the epistles attributed to John, unlike Revelation, do not name their author, and that the Greek of the gospel is stylistically correct and elegant while that of Revelation is neither; some later scholars believe that the two books also have radical differences in theological perspective.{{sfn|Collins|1984|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nTradition ascribes the authorship to [[John the Apostle]]. Critics of the traditional identification doubt that the apostle could have lived into the most likely time for the book's composition, the reign of Domitian, and the author never states that he knew Jesus.{{sfn|Collins|1984|pp=26\u201327}} All that is known is that this John was a [[Jewish Christian]] prophet, probably belonging to a group of such prophets, and was accepted as such by the congregations to whom he addresses his letter.{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|pp= 1535\u20131536}}{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2, 24\u201325}} His precise identity remains unknown,{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|p= 1535}} and modern scholarship commonly refers to him as \"[[John of Patmos]]\" {{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=}} ([[Revelation 1:9]] \u2013 \"I, John [...] was on the island called Patmos\" (NRSV)).\n\nThe book is commonly dated to about 95 AD. The date is suggested by clues in the visions pointing to the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]].{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}} The beast with seven heads and the number 666 seem to allude directly to the emperor [[Nero]] (reigned AD 54\u201368), but this does not require that Revelation was written in the 60s, as there was a widespread belief in later decades that [[Nero Redivivus|Nero would return]].{{sfn|Collins|1982|p=100}}{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|pp =1535\u20131536}} No original manuscript exists, and some (particularly [[Greek Orthodox]]) believe it was originally written on the walls of a cave on Patmos, now a UNESCO World Heritage site called the [[Cave of the Apocalypse]].\n\n=== Genre ===\nRevelation is an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] prophecy with an epistolary introduction addressed to seven churches in the Roman province of Asia.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2}} \"Apocalypse\" means the revealing of divine mysteries;{{sfn|McKim|2014|p=16}} John is to write down what is revealed (what he sees in his vision) and send it to the seven churches.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2}} The entire book constitutes the letter\u2014the letters to the seven individual churches are introductions to the rest of the book, which is addressed to all seven.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2}} While the dominant genre is apocalyptic, the author sees himself as a Christian prophet: Revelation uses the word in various forms twenty-one times, more than any other [[New Testament]] book.{{sfn|Couch|2001|p=81}}\n\n=== Sources ===\nThe predominant view is that Revelation alludes to the Old Testament although it is difficult among scholars to agree on the exact number of allusions or the allusions themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fekkes|first1=Jan|title=Isaiah and Prophetic Traditions in the Book of Revelation: Visionary Antecedents and their Development (The Library of New Testament Studies)|date=1994|publisher=Bloomsbury T&T Clark|isbn=978-1-85075-456-5|pages=61\u201363}}</ref> Revelation rarely quotes directly from the [[Old Testament]], yet almost every verse alludes to or echoes older scriptures. Over half of the references stem from [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]], and [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], with Daniel providing the largest number in proportion to length and Ezekiel standing out as the most influential. Because these references appear as allusions rather than as quotes, it is difficult to know whether the author used the Hebrew or the Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures, but he was clearly often influenced by the Greek. He very frequently combines multiple references, and again the allusional style makes it impossible to be certain to what extent he did so consciously.{{sfn|Beale|McDonough|2007|pp=1081\u20131084}}{{qn|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Setting ===\nConventional understanding until recent times was that the Book of Revelation was written to comfort beleaguered Christians as they underwent persecution at the hands of a [[megalomania]]cal Roman emperor, but much of this has now been jettisoned: [[Emperor Domitian|Domitian]] is no longer viewed as a despot imposing an imperial cult, and it is no longer believed that there was any systematic empire-wide persecution of Christians in his time.{{sfn|Stephens|2011|pp=143\u2013145}}{{Additional citation needed|date=June 2018}} The current view is that Revelation was composed in the context of a conflict within the Christian community of Asia Minor over whether to engage with, or withdraw from, the far larger non-Christian community: Revelation chastises those Christians who wanted to reach an accommodation with the Roman cult of empire.{{sfn|Stephens|2011|p=152}} This is not to say that Christians in Roman Asia were not suffering, for withdrawal from, and defiance against, the wider Roman society, which imposed very real penalties; Revelation offered a victory over this reality by offering an apocalyptic hope: in the words of professor [[Adela Yarbro Collins]], \"What ought to be was experienced as a present reality.\"{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=154}}\n\n=== Canonical history ===\n{{see|Development of the New Testament canon}}\nRevelation was among the last books accepted into the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]], and to the present day some churches that derive from the [[Church of the East]] reject it.{{sfn|Wall|2011|p=no page number}}<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Taylor\n| first1 = David G.

After a great fight, the Dragon and his angels are cast out of Heaven for good, followed by praises of victory for God's kingdom. (12:7\u201312). The Dragon engages to persecute the Woman, but she is given aid to evade him.

Karris (ed.) The Collegeville Bible Commentary Liturgical Press, 1992 p. 1296.</ref><ref>Ken Bowers, Hiding in plain sight, Cedar Fort, 2000 p. 175.</ref> to the views of critics who deny any spiritual value to Revelation at all,<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]] in his autobiography ''Memories Dream Reflections'' said \"I will not discuss the transparent prophecies of the Book of Revelation because no one believes in them and the whole subject is felt to be an embarrassing one.\"</ref> ascribing it to a human-inherited [[Jungian archetypes|archetype]].\n\n=== Liturgical ===\n==== Paschal liturgical ====\nThis interpretation, which has found expression among both Catholic and Protestant theologians, considers the liturgical worship, particularly the [[Easter]] rites, of early Christianity as background and context for understanding the Book of Revelation's structure and significance. This perspective is explained in ''The Paschal Liturgy and the Apocalypse'' (new edition, 2004) by [[Massey H. Shepherd]], an Episcopal scholar, and in [[Scott Hahn]]'s ''The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth'' (1999), in which he states that Revelation in form is structured after creation, fall, judgment and redemption. Those who hold this view say that the Temple's destruction (AD 70) had a profound effect on the Jewish people, not only in Jerusalem but among the Greek-speaking Jews of the Mediterranean.<ref>Scott Hahn, ''The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth'', {{ISBN|0-385-49659-1}}. New York: Doubleday, 1999.</ref>\n\nThey believe the Book of Revelation provides insight into the early Eucharist, saying that it is the new Temple worship in the New Heaven and Earth. The idea of the Eucharist as a foretaste of the heavenly banquet is also explored by British Methodist Geoffrey Wainwright in his book ''Eucharist and Eschatology'' (Oxford University Press, 1980). According to [[Pope Benedict XVI]] some of the images of Revelation should be understood in the context of the dramatic suffering and persecution of the churches of Asia in the 1st century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAccordingly, the Book of Revelation should not be read as an enigmatic warning, but as an encouraging vision of Christ's definitive victory over evil.<ref>{{cite web |author=Catholic Online |url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=20995 |title=Pope Benedict: Read Book of Revelation as Christ's victory over evil \u2013 International \u2013 Catholic Online |publisher=Catholic.org |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005010122/http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=20995 |archivedate=5 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==== Oriental Orthodox ====\nIn the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]] the whole Book of Revelation is read during Apocalypse Night or [[Good Friday]].<ref>[http://suscopts.org/resources/literature/222/night-of-the-apocalypse/ \"Night of the Apocalypse\"], published by [[Coptic Orthodox Diocese of the Southern United States]], accessed 23 May 2018</ref>\n\n=== Eschatological ===\nMost Christian interpretations fall into one or more of the following categories:\n* [[Historicism (Christianity)|Historicism]], which sees in Revelation a broad view of history;\n* [[Preterism]], in which Revelation mostly refers to the events of the [[apostolic era]] (1st century) or, at the latest, the fall of the [[Roman Empire]];\n* [[Amillennialism]], which rejects a literal interpretation of the \"millennium\" and treats the content of the book as symbolic;\n* [[Postmillennialism]], also rejects a literal interpretation of the \"millennium\" and sees the world becoming better and better, with the entire world eventually becoming \u201cChristianized;\"\n* [[Futurism (Christianity)|Futurism]], which believes that Revelation describes future events (modern believers in this interpretation are often called \"[[Millennialism|millennialists]]\"); and\n* [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealism/Allegoricalism]], which holds that Revelation does not refer to actual people or events, but is an [[allegory]] of the spiritual path and the ongoing struggle between [[good and evil]].\n\n==== Eastern Orthodox ====\n[[File:Apokalipsis XVI.jpg|thumb|An Orthodox [[icon]] of the Apocalypse of St. John, 16th century.]]\n[[Eastern Orthodoxy]] treats the text as simultaneously describing contemporaneous events (events occurring at the same time) and as prophecy of events to come, for which the contemporaneous events were a form of foreshadow. It rejects attempts to determine, before the fact, if the events of Revelation are occurring by mapping them onto present-day events, taking to heart the Scriptural warning against those who proclaim \"He is here!\" prematurely. Instead, the book is seen as a warning to be spiritually and morally ready for the end times, whenever they may come (\"as a thief in the night\"), but they will come at the time of God's choosing, not something that can be precipitated nor trivially deduced by mortals.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last =Averky (Taushev)\n | first =Archbishop\n | year =1996\n | title =The Apocalypse: In the Teachings of Ancient Christianity\n | editor-last =Eng. tr.

Pryse ''Apocalypse Unsealed'' London: Watkins (1910). The theory behind the book is given in [[Arthur Avalon]] (Sir John Woodroffe) ''The Serpent Power'' Madras (Chennai): Ganesh & Co (1913).

In this interpretation the primary agenda of the book is to expose as impostors the worldly powers that seek to oppose the ways of God and God's Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The chief temptation for Christians in the 1st century, and today, is to fail to hold fast to the non-violent teachings and example of Jesus and instead be lured into unquestioning adoption and assimilation of worldly, national or cultural values \u2013 [[imperialism]], [[nationalism]], and [[civil religion]] being the most dangerous and insidious.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThis perspective (closely related to [[liberation theology]]) draws on the approach of Bible scholars such as [[Ched Myers]], [[William Stringfellow]], [[Richard Horsley]], [[Daniel Berrigan]], Wes Howard-Brook,<ref>{{cite book|title=Unveiling Empire: Reading Revelation Then and Now|last= Howard-Brook|first=Wes|author2=Gwyther, Anthony|publisher=[[Orbis Books]]|year=1999|isbn=978-1-57075-287-2}}</ref> and [[Joerg Rieger]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Christ & Empire: From Paul to Postcolonial Times |last=Rieger| first=Joerg |publisher=[[Fortress Press]]| year=2007| isbn=978-0-8006-2038-7}}</ref> Various [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]], such as [[Jacques Ellul]], have identified the [[State (polity)|State]] and [[political power]] as [[The Beast (Bible)|the Beast]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |pages=123\u2013126 |quote=Revelation}}</ref> and the events described, being their doings and results, the aforementioned 'wrath'.\n\n=== Aesthetic and literary ===\nLiterary writers and theorists have contributed to a wide range of theories about the origins and purpose of the Book of Revelation. Some of these writers have no connection with established Christian faiths but, nevertheless, found in Revelation a source of inspiration. Revelation has been approached from Hindu philosophy and Jewish [[Midrash]]. Others have pointed to aspects of composition which have been ignored such as the similarities of prophetic inspiration to modern poetic inspiration, or the parallels with [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]]. In recent years, theories have arisen which concentrate upon how readers and texts interact to create meaning and which are less interested in what the original author intended.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[Charles Cutler Torrey]] taught [[Semitic languages]] at [[Yale University]]. His lasting contribution has been to show how prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, are much more meaningful when treated as poets first and foremost. He thought this was a point often lost sight of because most English bibles render everything in prose.<ref>Charles C. Torrey ''The Apocalypse of John'' New Haven: Yale University Press (1958). Christopher R. North in his ''The Second Isaiah'' London: OUP (1964) p. 23 says of Torrey's earlier Isaiah theory, \"Few scholars of any standing have accepted his theory.\" This is the general view of Torrey's theories. However, Christopher North goes on to cite Torrey on 20 major occasions and many more minor ones in the course of his book. So, Torrey must have had some influence and poetry is the key.</ref> Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets. Had he done so, he would have had to use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own. Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic.<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 7</ref>\n\nThis was why the surviving Greek translation was written in such a strange idiom. It was a literal translation that had to comply with the warning at Revelation 22:18 that the text must not be corrupted in any way. According to Torrey, the story is that \"The Fourth Gospel was brought to Ephesus by a Christian fugitive from Palestine soon after the middle of the first century. It was written in Aramaic.\" Later, the Ephesians claimed this fugitive had actually been the beloved disciple himself. Subsequently, this John was banished by Nero and died on Patmos after writing Revelation. Torrey argued that until AD 80, when Christians were expelled from the synagogues,<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 37</ref> the Christian message was always first heard in the synagogue and, for cultural reasons, the evangelist would have spoken in Aramaic, else \"he would have had no hearing.\"<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 8</ref> Torrey showed how the three major songs in Revelation (the new song, the song of Moses and the Lamb and the chorus at 19: 6\u20138) each fall naturally into four regular metrical lines plus a coda.<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 137</ref> Other dramatic moments in Revelation, such as 6:16 where the terrified people cry out to be hidden, behave in a similar way.<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 140</ref>\n\n[[Christina Rossetti]] was a Victorian poet who believed the sensual excitement of the natural world found its meaningful purpose in death and in God.<ref>\"Flowers preach to us if we will hear\", begins her poem 'Consider the lilies of the field' ''Goblin Market'' London: Oxford University Press (1913) p. 87</ref> Her ''The Face of the Deep'' is a meditation upon the Apocalypse. In her view, what Revelation has to teach is patience.<ref>Ms Rossetti remarks that patience is a word which does not occur in the Bible until the New Testament, as if the usage first came from Christ's own lips. Christina Rossetti ''The Face of the Deep'' London: SPCK (1892) p. 115</ref> Patience is the closest to perfection the human condition allows.<ref>\"Christians should resemble fire-flies, not glow-worms; their brightness drawing eyes upward, not downward.\" ''The Face of the Deep'' p. 26</ref> Her book, which is largely written in prose, frequently breaks into poetry or jubilation, much like Revelation itself. The relevance of John's visions<ref>'vision' lends the wrong emphasis as Ms Rossetti sought to minimise the distinction between John's experience and that of others. She quoted 1 John 3:24 \"He abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us\" to show that when John says, \"I was in the Spirit\" it is not exceptional.</ref> belongs to Christians of all times as a continuous present meditation. Such matters are eternal and outside of normal human reckoning. \"That winter which will be the death of Time has no promise of termination. Winter that returns not to spring ... \u2013 who can bear it?\"<ref>''The Face of the Deep'' p. 301</ref> She dealt deftly with the vengeful aspects of John's message. \"A few are charged to do judgment; everyone without exception is charged to show mercy.\"<ref>''The Face of the Deep'' p. 292</ref> Her conclusion is that Christians should see John as \"representative of all his brethren\" so they should \"hope as he hoped, love as he loved.\"<ref>''The Face of the Deep'' p. 495</ref>\n\nRecently, aesthetic and literary modes of interpretation have developed, which focus on Revelation as a work of art and imagination, viewing the imagery as symbolic depictions of timeless truths and the victory of good over evil. [[Elisabeth Sch\u00fcssler Fiorenza]] wrote ''Revelation: Vision of a Just World'' from the viewpoint of rhetoric.<ref>Elisabeth Schuessler Fiorenza ''Revelation: Vision of a Just World'' Edinburgh: T&T Clark (1993). The book seems to have started life as ''Invitation to the Book of Revelation'' Garden City: Doubleday (1981)</ref> Accordingly, Revelation's meaning is partially determined by the way John goes about saying things, partially by the context in which readers receive the message and partially by its appeal to something beyond logic.<ref name=\"Tina Pippin 1993 p. 105\">Tina Pippin ''Death & Desire: The rhetoric of gender in the Apocalypse of John'' Louisville: Westminster-John Knox (1993) p. 105</ref>\n\nProfessor Sch\u00fcssler Fiorenza believes that Revelation has particular relevance today as a liberating message to disadvantaged groups. John's book is a vision of a just world, not a vengeful threat of world-destruction. Her view that Revelation's message is not gender-based has caused dissent. She says we are to look behind the symbols rather than make a fetish out of them. In contrast, Tina Pippin states that John writes \"[[Horror fiction|horror literature]]\" and \"the [[misogyny]] which underlies the narrative is extreme.\"<ref name=\"Tina Pippin 1993 p. 105\"/>\n\n[[D. H. Lawrence]] took an opposing, pessimistic view of Revelation in the final book he wrote, ''Apocalypse''.<ref>D H Lawrence ''Apocalypse'' London: Martin Secker (1932) published posthumously with an introduction (pp. v\u2013xli) by Richard Aldington which is an integral part of the text.</ref> He saw the language which Revelation used as being bleak and destructive; a 'death-product'. Instead, he wanted to champion a public-spirited individualism (which he identified with the historical Jesus supplemented by an ill-defined cosmic consciousness) against its two natural enemies. One of these he called \"the sovereignty of the intellect\"<ref>''Apocalypse'' p. xxiii</ref> which he saw in a technology-based totalitarian society. The other enemy he styled \"vulgarity\"<ref>''Apocalypse'' p. 6</ref> and that was what he found in Revelation. \"It is very nice if you are poor and not humble ... to bring your enemies down to utter destruction, while you yourself rise up to grandeur. And nowhere does this happen so splendiferously than in Revelation.\"<ref>Apocalypse p. 11 Lawrence did not consider how these two types of Christianity (good and bad in his view) might be related other than as opposites. He noted the difference meant that the John who wrote a gospel could not be the same John that wrote Revelation.</ref>\n\nHis specific aesthetic objections to Revelation were that its imagery was unnatural and that phrases like \"the wrath of the Lamb\" were \"ridiculous.\" He saw Revelation as comprising two discordant halves. In the first, there was a scheme of cosmic renewal in \"great Chaldean sky-spaces\", which he quite liked. After that, Lawrence thought, the book became preoccupied with the birth of the baby messiah and \"flamboyant hate and simple lust ... for the end of the world.\" Lawrence coined the term \"Patmossers\" to describe those Christians who could only be happy in paradise if they knew their enemies were suffering in hell.<ref name=\"Lawrence1995\">{{cite book|author=D.

Under this interpretation, assertions that \"the time is near\" are to be taken literally by those communities. Consequently, the work is viewed as a warning to not conform to contemporary Greco-Roman society which John \"unveils\" as beastly, demonic, and subject to divine judgment.<ref name=\"Martin 2009\">[[Dale Martin]] 2009 (lecture). {{YouTube|XJ9Gt_R5a-k|\"24.

Ehrman|date=9 June 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nScholar Barbara Whitlock pointed out a similarity between the consistent destruction of thirds depicted in the Book of Revelation (a third of mankind by plagues of fire, smoke, and brimstone, a third of the trees and green grass, a third of the sea creatures and a third of the ships at sea, etc.)\nand the [[Persian mythology|Iranian mythology]] evil character [[Zahhak]] or Dah\u0101g, depicted in the [[Avesta]], the earliest religious texts of [[Zoroastrianism]]. Dah\u0101g is mentioned as wreaking much evil in the world until at last chained up and imprisoned on the mythical Mt. Dam\u0101vand. The Middle Persian sources prophesy that at the end of the world, Dah\u0101g will at last burst his bonds and ravage the world, consuming one in three humans and livestock, until the ancient hero [[Garshasp|Kirs\u0101sp]] returns to life to kill Dah\u0101g. Whitlock wrote: \"Zoroastrianism, the state religion of the Roman Empire's main rival, was part of the intellectual millieu in which Christianity came into being, just as were Judaism, the Greek-Roman religion, and the worship of Isis and Mithras. A Zoroastrian influence is completely plausible\".<ref>Dr. Barbara Whitlock, \"Tracing out the convoluted sources of Christianity\" in George D. Barnes (ed.), \"Collected New Essays in Comparative Religion\"</ref>\n\n== Old Testament origins ==\nMuch of Revelation employs ancient sources, primarily but not exclusively from the [[Old Testament]]. For example, Howard-Brook and Gwyther<ref>Wes Howard-Brook & Anthony Gwyther ''Unveiling Empire'' New York: Orbis (1999) p. 76</ref> regard the [[Book of Enoch]] (1 Enoch) as an equally significant but contextually different source. \"Enoch's journey has no close parallel in the Hebrew scriptures.\" Revelation, in one section, forms an inverted parallel ([[chiasmus]]) with the book of Enoch in which 1 En 100:1\u20133 has a river of blood deep enough to submerge a chariot and in Rev 14:20 has a river of blood up to the horse's bridle. There is an angel ascending in both accounts (1 En 100:4; Rev 14:14\u201319) and both accounts have three messages (1 En 100:7\u20139; Rev 14:6\u201312).<ref name=\":0\" />{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}}\n\nAcademics showed little interest in this topic until recently.<ref>S Moyise p. 13 reports no work whatsoever done between 1912 and 1984</ref> This was not, however, the case with popular writers from non-conforming backgrounds, who interspersed the text of Revelation with the prophecy they thought was being promised. For example, an anonymous Scottish commentary of 1871<ref>Anon ''An exposition of the Apocalypse on a new principle of literal interpretation'' Aberdeen: Brown (1871)</ref> prefaces Revelation 4 with the Little Apocalypse of Mark 13, places Malachi 4:5 (\"Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord\") within Revelation 11 and writes Revelation 12:7 side by side with the role of \"the Satan\" in the [[Book of Job]]. The message is that everything in Revelation will happen in its previously appointed time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nSteve Moyise uses the index of the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament to show that \"Revelation contains more Old Testament [[allusion]]s than any other New Testament book, but it does not record a single quotation.\"<ref>S. Moyise ''The Old Testament in the Book of Revelation'' Sheffield: [[Sheffield Academic Press]] (1995) p. 31</ref> Perhaps significantly, Revelation chooses different sources than other New Testament books. Revelation concentrates on Isaiah, Psalms, and Ezekiel, while neglecting, comparatively speaking, the books of the Pentateuch that are the dominant sources for other New Testament writers. Methodological objections have been made to this course as each allusion may not have an equal significance. To counter this, G. K. Beale sought to develop a system that distinguished 'clear', 'probable', and 'possible' allusions. A clear allusion is one with almost the same wording as its source, the same general meaning, and which could not reasonably have been drawn from elsewhere. A probable allusion contains an idea which is uniquely traceable to its source. Possible allusions are described as mere echoes of their putative sources.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nYet, with Revelation, the problems might be judged more fundamental. The author seems to be using his sources in a completely different way to the originals. For example, he borrows the 'new temple' imagery of Ezekiel 40\u201348 but uses it to describe a New Jerusalem which, quite pointedly, no longer needs a temple because it is God's dwelling. Ian Boxall<ref>Ian Boxall The Revelation of St John London: Continuum & Peabody MA: Hendrickson (2006) p. 254</ref> writes that Revelation \"is no montage of biblical quotations (that is not John's way) but a wealth of allusions and evocations rewoven into something new and creative.\" In trying to identify this \"something new\", Boxall argues that Ezekiel provides the 'backbone' for Revelation. He sets out a comparative table listing the chapters of Revelation in sequence and linking most of them to the structurally corresponding chapter in Ezekiel. The interesting point is that the order is not the same. John, on this theory, rearranges Ezekiel to suit his own purposes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nSome commentators argue that it is these purposes \u2013 and not the structure \u2013 that really matter. G. K. Beale believes that, however much John makes use of Ezekiel, his ultimate purpose is to present Revelation as a fulfillment of [[Daniel 7]].<ref>G. K. Beale John's use of the Old Testament in Revelation Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press (1998) p. 109</ref> [[Richard Bauckham]] has argued that John presents an early view of the Trinity through his descriptions of the visions and his identifying Jesus and the Holy Spirit with YHWH.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=}} Brandon Smith has expanded on both of their proposals while proposing a \"trinitarian reading\" of Revelation, arguing that John uses Old Testament language and allusions from various sources to describe a multiplicity of persons in YHWH without sacrificing monotheism, which would later be codified in the trinitarian doctrine of [[Nicene Christianity]].<ref>Brandon D. Smith, \"The Identification of Jesus with YHWH in the Book of Revelation, Criswell Theological Review (2016)</ref>\n\nOne theory, Revelation Draft Hypothesis, sees the book of Revelation constructed by forming parallels with several texts in the Old Testament such as Ezekiel, Isaiah, Zechariah, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Exodus, and Daniel. For example, Ezekiel's encounter with God is in reverse order as John's encounter with God (Ezek 1:5\u201328; Rev 4:2\u20137) note both accounts have beings with faces of a lion, ox or calf, man, and eagle (Ezek 1:10; Rev 4:7), both accounts have an expanse before the throne (Ezek 1:22; Rev 4:6). The chariot's horses in Zechariah's are the same colors as the four horses in Revelation (Zech 6:1\u20138; Rev 6:1\u20138). The nesting of the seven marches around Jericho by Joshua is reenacted by Jesus nesting the seven trumpets within the seventh seal (Josh 6:8\u201310; Rev 6:1\u201317; 8:1\u20139:21; 11:15\u201319). The description of the beast in Revelation is taken directly out of Daniel (see Dan 7:2\u20138; Rev 13:1\u20137). The method that John used allowed him to use the Hebrew Scriptures as the source and also use basic techniques of parallel formation, thereby alluding to the Hebrew Scriptures.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=How John Wrote the Book of Revelation: From Concept to Publication|last=Lewis|first=Kim|publisher=Kim Mark Lewis|year=2015|isbn=978-1-943325-00-9|location=Lorton, Virginia|pages=216, 226}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.revelationdrafthypothesis.info/|title=Revelation Draft Hypothesis|website=|access-date=}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}}\n\n== Figures in Revelation ==\nIn order of appearance:\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n# [[John of Patmos]]\n# The [[angel]] who reveals the Revelation of Jesus Christ\n# The One who sits on the [[Throne of God#Revelation|Throne]]\n# Twenty-four crowned [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]\n# Four [[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]]\n# The [[Lion of Judah]] who is the seven horned Lamb with seven eyes\n# [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]\n# the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, each given a white robe\n# Four angels holding the four winds of the Earth\n# The seal-bearer angel (144,000 of Israel sealed)\n# A great multitude from every nation \n# [[Seven trumpets|Seven angelic trumpeters]]\n# The star called [[Wormwood (star)|Wormwood]]\n# Angel of Woe\n# [[Scorpion]]-tailed [[Locust]]s\n# [[Abaddon]]\n# Four angels bound to the great river [[Euphrates]]\n# Two hundred million lion-headed [[cavalry]]\n# The mighty angel of Seven [[thunder]]s\n# The [[Two witnesses]]\n# [[The Beast (Revelation)|Beast of the Sea]] having seven heads and ten horns\n# [[Woman of the Apocalypse|The woman]] and her child\n# The [[Dragon]], fiery red with seven heads\n# [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael the Archangel]]\n# Lamb-horned [[The Beast (Revelation)#Beast from the earth|Beast of the Earth]]\n# [[The Beast (Revelation)#Image of the beast|Image of the Beast]] of the sea\n# Messages of the three angels\n# The angelic reapers and the grapes of wrath\n# Seven plague angels\n# Seven bowls of wrath\n# The [[False Prophet]]\n# [[Whore of Babylon]]\n# The rider on a white horse\n# The first resurrection and the thousand years\n# [[Gog and Magog]]\n# Death and [[Hades]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books|Book of Revelation}}\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Alpha and Omega]]\n* [[The Apocalypse (2000 film)|''The Apocalypse'']] \u2013 2000 film\n* [[Apocalypse of John \u2013 dated astronomically]]\n* [[Apocalypse of Peter]]\n* [[Apocalypse of Zerubbabel]]\n* [[Apocalypticism]]\n* [[Arethas of Caesarea]]\n* [[Biblical cosmology]]\n* [[Biblical numerology]]\n* [[Book of Ezekiel]]\n* [[Christian eschatological differences]]\n* [[Day-year principle]]\n* [[English Apocalypse manuscripts]]\n* [[Horae Apocalypticae]]\n* [[Maccabees]]\n* [[Masada]]\n* [[The New Earth]]\n* [[Number of the Beast]]\n* [[Patmos]]\n* [[Textual variants in the New Testament#Book of Revelation|Textual variants in the Book of Revelation]]\n* [[Vespasian]]\n* [[Woman of the Apocalypse]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n<!-- this verifies what precisely? academic boosterism? self-published?{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Kim Mark|title=How John Wrote the Book of Revelation: From Concept to Publication|date=2015|publisher=Kim Mark Lewis|location=Lorton, VA|isbn=978-1-943325-00-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ajYCgAAQBAJ}}-->\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last = Ammannati\n|first = Renato\n|title = Rivelazione e Storia.

Its title is derived from the [[Incipit|first word]] of the [[Koine Greek]] text: ''apokalypsis'', meaning \"unveiling\" or \"revelation\" (before title pages and titles, books were commonly known by their incipit (first words), as is also the case with the Hebrew ''[[Torah]]''). The Book of Revelation is the only [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic document]] in the New Testament [[Biblical canon|canon]] (although there are short apocalyptic passages in various places in [[the Gospels]] and the [[Epistles]], and an extended apocalyptic passage in the [[Book of Daniel]] in the [[Old Testament]]).{{Efn|Other apocalypses popular in the [[early Christian]] era did not achieve canonical status, except [[2 Esdras]] (also known as the Apocalypse of Ezra), which is recognized as canonical in [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] churches.}} Thus, it occupies a central place in [[Christian eschatology]].\n\nThe author names himself as \"John\" in the text, but his precise identity remains a point of academic debate. Second-century Christian writers such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Melito]] (the bishop of Sardis), [[Clement of Alexandria]], and the author of the [[Muratorian fragment]] identify [[John the Apostle]] as the \"John\" of Revelation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carson|first=Don|title=An Introduction to the New Testament|date=2005|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=978-0-310-51940-9|pages=465ff|edition=2nd}}</ref> Modern scholarship generally takes a different view,{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=28}} with many considering that nothing can be known about the author except that he was a Christian prophet.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2}} Some modern scholars characterize Revelation's author as a putative figure whom they call \"[[John of Patmos]]\". The bulk of traditional sources date the book to the reign of the Roman emperor [[Domitian]] (AD 81\u201396), which evidence tends to confirm.{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|pp=1535\u20131536}}{{efn|However, among recent writers, John Behr<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6u-MDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=john+behr+paschal+gospel&hl=en&ppis=_c&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjM9PTv8K3oAhWndN8KHa_GAFUQ6AEwAXoECAUQAg#v=onepage&q=john%20behr%20paschal%20gospel&f=false|title=John the Theologian and his Paschal Gospel|last=Behr|first=John|date=2019|location=Oxford}}</ref> argues that Irenaeus and the earliest traditions of the church placed the writing in the reign of Nero.}}\n\nThe book spans three literary genres: the [[letter (message)|epistolary]], the [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]], and the [[prophetic]].{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|p=1536}} It begins with John, on the island of [[Patmos]] in the [[Aegean Sea]], addressing a letter to the \"[[Seven Churches of Asia]]\". He then describes a series of prophetic [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]], including of figures such as the Seven-Headed Dragon, [[Serpents in the Bible#Ancient serpent|the Serpent]], and [[The Beast (Revelation)|the Beast]], which culminate in the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]].\n\nThe obscure and extravagant imagery has led to a wide variety of Christian interpretations. [[Historicism (Christianity)|Historicist]] interpretations see Revelation as containing a broad view of history, whilst [[preterist]] interpretations treat Revelation as mostly referring to the events of the [[Apostolic Age]] (1st century), or, at the latest, the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Futurism (Christianity)|Futurists]], meanwhile, believe that Revelation describes future events, with the seven churches growing into the body/believers throughout the age, and a reemergence or continuous rule of a Roman/Graeco system with modern capabilities described by John in ways familiar to him, and [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|idealist or symbolic]] interpretations consider that Revelation does not refer to actual people or events, but is an [[allegory]] of the spiritual path and the ongoing struggle between good and evil.\n\n== Composition and setting ==\n[[File:Johannes op Patmos Saint John on Patmos Berlin, Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin, Gemaldegalerie HR.jpg|thumb|''[[St. John the Evangelist on Patmos]]'' by [[Hieronymous Bosch]], circa 1489]]\n\n=== Title, authorship, and date ===\n[[File:ApocalypseStSeverFol026vJohnRecievesRev.jpg|thumb|St. John receives his Revelation. [[Saint-Sever Beatus]], 11th century.]]\n{{Main|Authorship of the Johannine works}}\nThe name ''Revelation'' comes from the [[Incipit|first word]] of the book in [[Koine Greek]]: \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 (''apokalypsis''), which means \"unveiling\" or \"revelation\". The author names himself as \"John\", but modern scholars consider it unlikely that the author of Revelation also wrote the [[Gospel of John]]. [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria]] set out some of the evidence for this view as early as the second half of the third century, noting that the gospel and the epistles attributed to John, unlike Revelation, do not name their author, and that the Greek of the gospel is stylistically correct and elegant while that of Revelation is neither; some later scholars believe that the two books also have radical differences in theological perspective.{{sfn|Collins|1984|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nTradition ascribes the authorship to [[John the Apostle]]. Critics of the traditional identification doubt that the apostle could have lived into the most likely time for the book's composition, the reign of Domitian, and the author never states that he knew Jesus.{{sfn|Collins|1984|pp=26\u201327}} All that is known is that this John was a [[Jewish Christian]] prophet, probably belonging to a group of such prophets, and was accepted as such by the congregations to whom he addresses his letter.{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|pp= 1535\u20131536}}{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2, 24\u201325}} His precise identity remains unknown,{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|p= 1535}} and modern scholarship commonly refers to him as \"[[John of Patmos]]\" {{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=}} ([[Revelation 1:9]] \u2013 \"I, John [...] was on the island called Patmos\" (NRSV)).\n\nThe book is commonly dated to about 95 AD. The date is suggested by clues in the visions pointing to the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]].{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}} The beast with seven heads and the number 666 seem to allude directly to the emperor [[Nero]] (reigned AD 54\u201368), but this does not require that Revelation was written in the 60s, as there was a widespread belief in later decades that [[Nero Redivivus|Nero would return]].{{sfn|Collins|1982|p=100}}{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|pp =1535\u20131536}} No original manuscript exists, and some (particularly [[Greek Orthodox]]) believe it was originally written on the walls of a cave on Patmos, now a UNESCO World Heritage site called the [[Cave of the Apocalypse]].\n\n=== Genre ===\nRevelation is an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] prophecy with an epistolary introduction addressed to seven churches in the Roman province of Asia.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2}} \"Apocalypse\" means the revealing of divine mysteries;{{sfn|McKim|2014|p=16}} John is to write down what is revealed (what he sees in his vision) and send it to the seven churches.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2}} The entire book constitutes the letter\u2014the letters to the seven individual churches are introductions to the rest of the book, which is addressed to all seven.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2}} While the dominant genre is apocalyptic, the author sees himself as a Christian prophet: Revelation uses the word in various forms twenty-one times, more than any other [[New Testament]] book.{{sfn|Couch|2001|p=81}}\n\n=== Sources ===\nThe predominant view is that Revelation alludes to the Old Testament although it is difficult among scholars to agree on the exact number of allusions or the allusions themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fekkes|first1=Jan|title=Isaiah and Prophetic Traditions in the Book of Revelation: Visionary Antecedents and their Development (The Library of New Testament Studies)|date=1994|publisher=Bloomsbury T&T Clark|isbn=978-1-85075-456-5|pages=61\u201363}}</ref> Revelation rarely quotes directly from the [[Old Testament]], yet almost every verse alludes to or echoes older scriptures. Over half of the references stem from [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]], and [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], with Daniel providing the largest number in proportion to length and Ezekiel standing out as the most influential. Because these references appear as allusions rather than as quotes, it is difficult to know whether the author used the Hebrew or the Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures, but he was clearly often influenced by the Greek. He very frequently combines multiple references, and again the allusional style makes it impossible to be certain to what extent he did so consciously.{{sfn|Beale|McDonough|2007|pp=1081\u20131084}}{{qn|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Setting ===\nConventional understanding until recent times was that the Book of Revelation was written to comfort beleaguered Christians as they underwent persecution at the hands of a [[megalomania]]cal Roman emperor, but much of this has now been jettisoned: [[Emperor Domitian|Domitian]] is no longer viewed as a despot imposing an imperial cult, and it is no longer believed that there was any systematic empire-wide persecution of Christians in his time.{{sfn|Stephens|2011|pp=143\u2013145}}{{Additional citation needed|date=June 2018}} The current view is that Revelation was composed in the context of a conflict within the Christian community of Asia Minor over whether to engage with, or withdraw from, the far larger non-Christian community: Revelation chastises those Christians who wanted to reach an accommodation with the Roman cult of empire.{{sfn|Stephens|2011|p=152}} This is not to say that Christians in Roman Asia were not suffering, for withdrawal from, and defiance against, the wider Roman society, which imposed very real penalties; Revelation offered a victory over this reality by offering an apocalyptic hope: in the words of professor [[Adela Yarbro Collins]], \"What ought to be was experienced as a present reality.\"{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=154}}\n\n=== Canonical history ===\n{{see|Development of the New Testament canon}}\nRevelation was among the last books accepted into the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]], and to the present day some churches that derive from the [[Church of the East]] reject it.{{sfn|Wall|2011|p=no page number}}<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Taylor\n| first1 = David G.

The Dragon engages to persecute the Woman, but she is given aid to evade him. Her evasiveness enrages the Dragon, prompting him to wage war against the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

The Collegeville Bible Commentary Liturgical Press, 1992 p. 1296.</ref><ref>Ken Bowers, Hiding in plain sight, Cedar Fort, 2000 p. 175.</ref> to the views of critics who deny any spiritual value to Revelation at all,<ref>[[Carl Gustav Jung]] in his autobiography ''Memories Dream Reflections'' said \"I will not discuss the transparent prophecies of the Book of Revelation because no one believes in them and the whole subject is felt to be an embarrassing one.\"</ref> ascribing it to a human-inherited [[Jungian archetypes|archetype]].\n\n=== Liturgical ===\n==== Paschal liturgical ====\nThis interpretation, which has found expression among both Catholic and Protestant theologians, considers the liturgical worship, particularly the [[Easter]] rites, of early Christianity as background and context for understanding the Book of Revelation's structure and significance. This perspective is explained in ''The Paschal Liturgy and the Apocalypse'' (new edition, 2004) by [[Massey H. Shepherd]], an Episcopal scholar, and in [[Scott Hahn]]'s ''The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth'' (1999), in which he states that Revelation in form is structured after creation, fall, judgment and redemption. Those who hold this view say that the Temple's destruction (AD 70) had a profound effect on the Jewish people, not only in Jerusalem but among the Greek-speaking Jews of the Mediterranean.<ref>Scott Hahn, ''The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth'', {{ISBN|0-385-49659-1}}. New York: Doubleday, 1999.</ref>\n\nThey believe the Book of Revelation provides insight into the early Eucharist, saying that it is the new Temple worship in the New Heaven and Earth. The idea of the Eucharist as a foretaste of the heavenly banquet is also explored by British Methodist Geoffrey Wainwright in his book ''Eucharist and Eschatology'' (Oxford University Press, 1980). According to [[Pope Benedict XVI]] some of the images of Revelation should be understood in the context of the dramatic suffering and persecution of the churches of Asia in the 1st century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAccordingly, the Book of Revelation should not be read as an enigmatic warning, but as an encouraging vision of Christ's definitive victory over evil.<ref>{{cite web |author=Catholic Online |url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=20995 |title=Pope Benedict: Read Book of Revelation as Christ's victory over evil \u2013 International \u2013 Catholic Online |publisher=Catholic.org |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005010122/http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=20995 |archivedate=5 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==== Oriental Orthodox ====\nIn the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]] the whole Book of Revelation is read during Apocalypse Night or [[Good Friday]].<ref>[http://suscopts.org/resources/literature/222/night-of-the-apocalypse/ \"Night of the Apocalypse\"], published by [[Coptic Orthodox Diocese of the Southern United States]], accessed 23 May 2018</ref>\n\n=== Eschatological ===\nMost Christian interpretations fall into one or more of the following categories:\n* [[Historicism (Christianity)|Historicism]], which sees in Revelation a broad view of history;\n* [[Preterism]], in which Revelation mostly refers to the events of the [[apostolic era]] (1st century) or, at the latest, the fall of the [[Roman Empire]];\n* [[Amillennialism]], which rejects a literal interpretation of the \"millennium\" and treats the content of the book as symbolic;\n* [[Postmillennialism]], also rejects a literal interpretation of the \"millennium\" and sees the world becoming better and better, with the entire world eventually becoming \u201cChristianized;\"\n* [[Futurism (Christianity)|Futurism]], which believes that Revelation describes future events (modern believers in this interpretation are often called \"[[Millennialism|millennialists]]\"); and\n* [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Idealism/Allegoricalism]], which holds that Revelation does not refer to actual people or events, but is an [[allegory]] of the spiritual path and the ongoing struggle between [[good and evil]].\n\n==== Eastern Orthodox ====\n[[File:Apokalipsis XVI.jpg|thumb|An Orthodox [[icon]] of the Apocalypse of St. John, 16th century.]]\n[[Eastern Orthodoxy]] treats the text as simultaneously describing contemporaneous events (events occurring at the same time) and as prophecy of events to come, for which the contemporaneous events were a form of foreshadow. It rejects attempts to determine, before the fact, if the events of Revelation are occurring by mapping them onto present-day events, taking to heart the Scriptural warning against those who proclaim \"He is here!\" prematurely. Instead, the book is seen as a warning to be spiritually and morally ready for the end times, whenever they may come (\"as a thief in the night\"), but they will come at the time of God's choosing, not something that can be precipitated nor trivially deduced by mortals.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last =Averky (Taushev)\n | first =Archbishop\n | year =1996\n | title =The Apocalypse: In the Teachings of Ancient Christianity\n | editor-last =Eng. tr.

Christian Gnostics \"believed in the Forgiveness of Sins, but in no vicarious sacrifice for sin ... they accepted Christ in the full realisation of the word; his life, not his death, was the keynote of their doctrine and their practice.\"<ref>R. [[Frances Swiney]] (Rosa Frances Emily Biggs) ''The Esoteric Teaching of the Gnostics'' London: Yellon, Williams & Co (1909) pp. 3, 4</ref>\n\n[[James Morgan Pryse]] was an esoteric gnostic who saw Revelation as a western version of the Hindu theory of the [[Chakra]]. He began his work, \"The purpose of this book is to show that the Apocalypse is a manual of spiritual development and not, as conventionally interpreted, a cryptic history or prophecy.\"<ref>James M. Pryse ''Apocalypse Unsealed'' London: Watkins (1910). The theory behind the book is given in [[Arthur Avalon]] (Sir John Woodroffe) ''The Serpent Power'' Madras (Chennai): Ganesh & Co (1913). One version of how these beliefs might have travelled from India to the Middle East, Greece and Rome is given in the opening chapters of [[Rudolf Otto]] ''The Kingdom of God and the Son of Man'' London: Lutterworth (1938)</ref> Such diverse theories have failed to command widespread acceptance. But Christopher Rowland argues: \"there are always going to be loose threads which refuse to be woven into the fabric as a whole. The presence of the threads which stubbornly refuse to be incorporated into the neat tapestry of our world-view does not usually totally undermine that view.\"<ref>Christopher Rowland ''Revelation'' London: Epworth (1993) p. 5</ref>\n\n==== Radical discipleship ====\nThe radical discipleship interpretation asserts that the Book of Revelation is best understood as a handbook for radical discipleship; i.&nbsp;e., how to remain faithful to the spirit and teachings of Jesus and avoid simply assimilating to surrounding society. In this interpretation the primary agenda of the book is to expose as impostors the worldly powers that seek to oppose the ways of God and God's Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The chief temptation for Christians in the 1st century, and today, is to fail to hold fast to the non-violent teachings and example of Jesus and instead be lured into unquestioning adoption and assimilation of worldly, national or cultural values \u2013 [[imperialism]], [[nationalism]], and [[civil religion]] being the most dangerous and insidious.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThis perspective (closely related to [[liberation theology]]) draws on the approach of Bible scholars such as [[Ched Myers]], [[William Stringfellow]], [[Richard Horsley]], [[Daniel Berrigan]], Wes Howard-Brook,<ref>{{cite book|title=Unveiling Empire: Reading Revelation Then and Now|last= Howard-Brook|first=Wes|author2=Gwyther, Anthony|publisher=[[Orbis Books]]|year=1999|isbn=978-1-57075-287-2}}</ref> and [[Joerg Rieger]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Christ & Empire: From Paul to Postcolonial Times |last=Rieger| first=Joerg |publisher=[[Fortress Press]]| year=2007| isbn=978-0-8006-2038-7}}</ref> Various [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]], such as [[Jacques Ellul]], have identified the [[State (polity)|State]] and [[political power]] as [[The Beast (Bible)|the Beast]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |pages=123\u2013126 |quote=Revelation}}</ref> and the events described, being their doings and results, the aforementioned 'wrath'.\n\n=== Aesthetic and literary ===\nLiterary writers and theorists have contributed to a wide range of theories about the origins and purpose of the Book of Revelation. Some of these writers have no connection with established Christian faiths but, nevertheless, found in Revelation a source of inspiration. Revelation has been approached from Hindu philosophy and Jewish [[Midrash]]. Others have pointed to aspects of composition which have been ignored such as the similarities of prophetic inspiration to modern poetic inspiration, or the parallels with [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]]. In recent years, theories have arisen which concentrate upon how readers and texts interact to create meaning and which are less interested in what the original author intended.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[Charles Cutler Torrey]] taught [[Semitic languages]] at [[Yale University]]. His lasting contribution has been to show how prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, are much more meaningful when treated as poets first and foremost. He thought this was a point often lost sight of because most English bibles render everything in prose.<ref>Charles C. Torrey ''The Apocalypse of John'' New Haven: Yale University Press (1958). Christopher R. North in his ''The Second Isaiah'' London: OUP (1964) p. 23 says of Torrey's earlier Isaiah theory, \"Few scholars of any standing have accepted his theory.\" This is the general view of Torrey's theories. However, Christopher North goes on to cite Torrey on 20 major occasions and many more minor ones in the course of his book. So, Torrey must have had some influence and poetry is the key.</ref> Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets. Had he done so, he would have had to use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own. Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic.<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 7</ref>\n\nThis was why the surviving Greek translation was written in such a strange idiom. It was a literal translation that had to comply with the warning at Revelation 22:18 that the text must not be corrupted in any way. According to Torrey, the story is that \"The Fourth Gospel was brought to Ephesus by a Christian fugitive from Palestine soon after the middle of the first century. It was written in Aramaic.\" Later, the Ephesians claimed this fugitive had actually been the beloved disciple himself. Subsequently, this John was banished by Nero and died on Patmos after writing Revelation. Torrey argued that until AD 80, when Christians were expelled from the synagogues,<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 37</ref> the Christian message was always first heard in the synagogue and, for cultural reasons, the evangelist would have spoken in Aramaic, else \"he would have had no hearing.\"<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 8</ref> Torrey showed how the three major songs in Revelation (the new song, the song of Moses and the Lamb and the chorus at 19: 6\u20138) each fall naturally into four regular metrical lines plus a coda.<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 137</ref> Other dramatic moments in Revelation, such as 6:16 where the terrified people cry out to be hidden, behave in a similar way.<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 140</ref>\n\n[[Christina Rossetti]] was a Victorian poet who believed the sensual excitement of the natural world found its meaningful purpose in death and in God.<ref>\"Flowers preach to us if we will hear\", begins her poem 'Consider the lilies of the field' ''Goblin Market'' London: Oxford University Press (1913) p. 87</ref> Her ''The Face of the Deep'' is a meditation upon the Apocalypse. In her view, what Revelation has to teach is patience.<ref>Ms Rossetti remarks that patience is a word which does not occur in the Bible until the New Testament, as if the usage first came from Christ's own lips. Christina Rossetti ''The Face of the Deep'' London: SPCK (1892) p. 115</ref> Patience is the closest to perfection the human condition allows.<ref>\"Christians should resemble fire-flies, not glow-worms; their brightness drawing eyes upward, not downward.\" ''The Face of the Deep'' p. 26</ref> Her book, which is largely written in prose, frequently breaks into poetry or jubilation, much like Revelation itself. The relevance of John's visions<ref>'vision' lends the wrong emphasis as Ms Rossetti sought to minimise the distinction between John's experience and that of others. She quoted 1 John 3:24 \"He abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us\" to show that when John says, \"I was in the Spirit\" it is not exceptional.</ref> belongs to Christians of all times as a continuous present meditation. Such matters are eternal and outside of normal human reckoning. \"That winter which will be the death of Time has no promise of termination. Winter that returns not to spring ... \u2013 who can bear it?\"<ref>''The Face of the Deep'' p. 301</ref> She dealt deftly with the vengeful aspects of John's message. \"A few are charged to do judgment; everyone without exception is charged to show mercy.\"<ref>''The Face of the Deep'' p. 292</ref> Her conclusion is that Christians should see John as \"representative of all his brethren\" so they should \"hope as he hoped, love as he loved.\"<ref>''The Face of the Deep'' p. 495</ref>\n\nRecently, aesthetic and literary modes of interpretation have developed, which focus on Revelation as a work of art and imagination, viewing the imagery as symbolic depictions of timeless truths and the victory of good over evil. [[Elisabeth Sch\u00fcssler Fiorenza]] wrote ''Revelation: Vision of a Just World'' from the viewpoint of rhetoric.<ref>Elisabeth Schuessler Fiorenza ''Revelation: Vision of a Just World'' Edinburgh: T&T Clark (1993). The book seems to have started life as ''Invitation to the Book of Revelation'' Garden City: Doubleday (1981)</ref> Accordingly, Revelation's meaning is partially determined by the way John goes about saying things, partially by the context in which readers receive the message and partially by its appeal to something beyond logic.<ref name=\"Tina Pippin 1993 p. 105\">Tina Pippin ''Death & Desire: The rhetoric of gender in the Apocalypse of John'' Louisville: Westminster-John Knox (1993) p. 105</ref>\n\nProfessor Sch\u00fcssler Fiorenza believes that Revelation has particular relevance today as a liberating message to disadvantaged groups. John's book is a vision of a just world, not a vengeful threat of world-destruction. Her view that Revelation's message is not gender-based has caused dissent. She says we are to look behind the symbols rather than make a fetish out of them. In contrast, Tina Pippin states that John writes \"[[Horror fiction|horror literature]]\" and \"the [[misogyny]] which underlies the narrative is extreme.\"<ref name=\"Tina Pippin 1993 p. 105\"/>\n\n[[D. H. Lawrence]] took an opposing, pessimistic view of Revelation in the final book he wrote, ''Apocalypse''.<ref>D H Lawrence ''Apocalypse'' London: Martin Secker (1932) published posthumously with an introduction (pp. v\u2013xli) by Richard Aldington which is an integral part of the text.</ref> He saw the language which Revelation used as being bleak and destructive; a 'death-product'. Instead, he wanted to champion a public-spirited individualism (which he identified with the historical Jesus supplemented by an ill-defined cosmic consciousness) against its two natural enemies. One of these he called \"the sovereignty of the intellect\"<ref>''Apocalypse'' p. xxiii</ref> which he saw in a technology-based totalitarian society. The other enemy he styled \"vulgarity\"<ref>''Apocalypse'' p. 6</ref> and that was what he found in Revelation. \"It is very nice if you are poor and not humble ... to bring your enemies down to utter destruction, while you yourself rise up to grandeur. And nowhere does this happen so splendiferously than in Revelation.\"<ref>Apocalypse p. 11 Lawrence did not consider how these two types of Christianity (good and bad in his view) might be related other than as opposites. He noted the difference meant that the John who wrote a gospel could not be the same John that wrote Revelation.</ref>\n\nHis specific aesthetic objections to Revelation were that its imagery was unnatural and that phrases like \"the wrath of the Lamb\" were \"ridiculous.\" He saw Revelation as comprising two discordant halves. In the first, there was a scheme of cosmic renewal in \"great Chaldean sky-spaces\", which he quite liked. After that, Lawrence thought, the book became preoccupied with the birth of the baby messiah and \"flamboyant hate and simple lust ... for the end of the world.\" Lawrence coined the term \"Patmossers\" to describe those Christians who could only be happy in paradise if they knew their enemies were suffering in hell.<ref name=\"Lawrence1995\">{{cite book|author=D.

Dah\u0101g is mentioned as wreaking much evil in the world until at last chained up and imprisoned on the mythical Mt. Dam\u0101vand. The Middle Persian sources prophesy that at the end of the world, Dah\u0101g will at last burst his bonds and ravage the world, consuming one in three humans and livestock, until the ancient hero [[Garshasp|Kirs\u0101sp]] returns to life to kill Dah\u0101g. Whitlock wrote: \"Zoroastrianism, the state religion of the Roman Empire's main rival, was part of the intellectual millieu in which Christianity came into being, just as were Judaism, the Greek-Roman religion, and the worship of Isis and Mithras. A Zoroastrian influence is completely plausible\".<ref>Dr. Barbara Whitlock, \"Tracing out the convoluted sources of Christianity\" in George D.

For example, Howard-Brook and Gwyther<ref>Wes Howard-Brook & Anthony Gwyther ''Unveiling Empire'' New York: Orbis (1999) p. 76</ref> regard the [[Book of Enoch]] (1 Enoch) as an equally significant but contextually different source. \"Enoch's journey has no close parallel in the Hebrew scriptures.\" Revelation, in one section, forms an inverted parallel ([[chiasmus]]) with the book of Enoch in which 1 En 100:1\u20133 has a river of blood deep enough to submerge a chariot and in Rev 14:20 has a river of blood up to the horse's bridle. There is an angel ascending in both accounts (1 En 100:4; Rev 14:14\u201319) and both accounts have three messages (1 En 100:7\u20139; Rev 14:6\u201312).<ref name=\":0\" />{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}}\n\nAcademics showed little interest in this topic until recently.<ref>S Moyise p. 13 reports no work whatsoever done between 1912 and 1984</ref> This was not, however, the case with popular writers from non-conforming backgrounds, who interspersed the text of Revelation with the prophecy they thought was being promised. For example, an anonymous Scottish commentary of 1871<ref>Anon ''An exposition of the Apocalypse on a new principle of literal interpretation'' Aberdeen: Brown (1871)</ref> prefaces Revelation 4 with the Little Apocalypse of Mark 13, places Malachi 4:5 (\"Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord\") within Revelation 11 and writes Revelation 12:7 side by side with the role of \"the Satan\" in the [[Book of Job]]. The message is that everything in Revelation will happen in its previously appointed time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nSteve Moyise uses the index of the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament to show that \"Revelation contains more Old Testament [[allusion]]s than any other New Testament book, but it does not record a single quotation.\"<ref>S. Moyise ''The Old Testament in the Book of Revelation'' Sheffield: [[Sheffield Academic Press]] (1995) p. 31</ref> Perhaps significantly, Revelation chooses different sources than other New Testament books. Revelation concentrates on Isaiah, Psalms, and Ezekiel, while neglecting, comparatively speaking, the books of the Pentateuch that are the dominant sources for other New Testament writers. Methodological objections have been made to this course as each allusion may not have an equal significance. To counter this, G. K. Beale sought to develop a system that distinguished 'clear', 'probable', and 'possible' allusions. A clear allusion is one with almost the same wording as its source, the same general meaning, and which could not reasonably have been drawn from elsewhere. A probable allusion contains an idea which is uniquely traceable to its source. Possible allusions are described as mere echoes of their putative sources.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nYet, with Revelation, the problems might be judged more fundamental. The author seems to be using his sources in a completely different way to the originals. For example, he borrows the 'new temple' imagery of Ezekiel 40\u201348 but uses it to describe a New Jerusalem which, quite pointedly, no longer needs a temple because it is God's dwelling. Ian Boxall<ref>Ian Boxall The Revelation of St John London: Continuum & Peabody MA: Hendrickson (2006) p. 254</ref> writes that Revelation \"is no montage of biblical quotations (that is not John's way) but a wealth of allusions and evocations rewoven into something new and creative.\" In trying to identify this \"something new\", Boxall argues that Ezekiel provides the 'backbone' for Revelation. He sets out a comparative table listing the chapters of Revelation in sequence and linking most of them to the structurally corresponding chapter in Ezekiel. The interesting point is that the order is not the same. John, on this theory, rearranges Ezekiel to suit his own purposes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nSome commentators argue that it is these purposes \u2013 and not the structure \u2013 that really matter. G. K. Beale believes that, however much John makes use of Ezekiel, his ultimate purpose is to present Revelation as a fulfillment of [[Daniel 7]].<ref>G. K. Beale John's use of the Old Testament in Revelation Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press (1998) p. 109</ref> [[Richard Bauckham]] has argued that John presents an early view of the Trinity through his descriptions of the visions and his identifying Jesus and the Holy Spirit with YHWH.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=}} Brandon Smith has expanded on both of their proposals while proposing a \"trinitarian reading\" of Revelation, arguing that John uses Old Testament language and allusions from various sources to describe a multiplicity of persons in YHWH without sacrificing monotheism, which would later be codified in the trinitarian doctrine of [[Nicene Christianity]].<ref>Brandon D. Smith, \"The Identification of Jesus with YHWH in the Book of Revelation, Criswell Theological Review (2016)</ref>\n\nOne theory, Revelation Draft Hypothesis, sees the book of Revelation constructed by forming parallels with several texts in the Old Testament such as Ezekiel, Isaiah, Zechariah, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Exodus, and Daniel. For example, Ezekiel's encounter with God is in reverse order as John's encounter with God (Ezek 1:5\u201328; Rev 4:2\u20137) note both accounts have beings with faces of a lion, ox or calf, man, and eagle (Ezek 1:10; Rev 4:7), both accounts have an expanse before the throne (Ezek 1:22; Rev 4:6). The chariot's horses in Zechariah's are the same colors as the four horses in Revelation (Zech 6:1\u20138; Rev 6:1\u20138). The nesting of the seven marches around Jericho by Joshua is reenacted by Jesus nesting the seven trumpets within the seventh seal (Josh 6:8\u201310; Rev 6:1\u201317; 8:1\u20139:21; 11:15\u201319). The description of the beast in Revelation is taken directly out of Daniel (see Dan 7:2\u20138; Rev 13:1\u20137). The method that John used allowed him to use the Hebrew Scriptures as the source and also use basic techniques of parallel formation, thereby alluding to the Hebrew Scriptures.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=How John Wrote the Book of Revelation: From Concept to Publication|last=Lewis|first=Kim|publisher=Kim Mark Lewis|year=2015|isbn=978-1-943325-00-9|location=Lorton, Virginia|pages=216, 226}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.revelationdrafthypothesis.info/|title=Revelation Draft Hypothesis|website=|access-date=}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}}\n\n== Figures in Revelation ==\nIn order of appearance:\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n# [[John of Patmos]]\n# The [[angel]] who reveals the Revelation of Jesus Christ\n# The One who sits on the [[Throne of God#Revelation|Throne]]\n# Twenty-four crowned [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]\n# Four [[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]]\n# The [[Lion of Judah]] who is the seven horned Lamb with seven eyes\n# [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]\n# the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, each given a white robe\n# Four angels holding the four winds of the Earth\n# The seal-bearer angel (144,000 of Israel sealed)\n# A great multitude from every nation \n# [[Seven trumpets|Seven angelic trumpeters]]\n# The star called [[Wormwood (star)|Wormwood]]\n# Angel of Woe\n# [[Scorpion]]-tailed [[Locust]]s\n# [[Abaddon]]\n# Four angels bound to the great river [[Euphrates]]\n# Two hundred million lion-headed [[cavalry]]\n# The mighty angel of Seven [[thunder]]s\n# The [[Two witnesses]]\n# [[The Beast (Revelation)|Beast of the Sea]] having seven heads and ten horns\n# [[Woman of the Apocalypse|The woman]] and her child\n# The [[Dragon]], fiery red with seven heads\n# [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael the Archangel]]\n# Lamb-horned [[The Beast (Revelation)#Beast from the earth|Beast of the Earth]]\n# [[The Beast (Revelation)#Image of the beast|Image of the Beast]] of the sea\n# Messages of the three angels\n# The angelic reapers and the grapes of wrath\n# Seven plague angels\n# Seven bowls of wrath\n# The [[False Prophet]]\n# [[Whore of Babylon]]\n# The rider on a white horse\n# The first resurrection and the thousand years\n# [[Gog and Magog]]\n# Death and [[Hades]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books|Book of Revelation}}\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Alpha and Omega]]\n* [[The Apocalypse (2000 film)|''The Apocalypse'']] \u2013 2000 film\n* [[Apocalypse of John \u2013 dated astronomically]]\n* [[Apocalypse of Peter]]\n* [[Apocalypse of Zerubbabel]]\n* [[Apocalypticism]]\n* [[Arethas of Caesarea]]\n* [[Biblical cosmology]]\n* [[Biblical numerology]]\n* [[Book of Ezekiel]]\n* [[Christian eschatological differences]]\n* [[Day-year principle]]\n* [[English Apocalypse manuscripts]]\n* [[Horae Apocalypticae]]\n* [[Maccabees]]\n* [[Masada]]\n* [[The New Earth]]\n* [[Number of the Beast]]\n* [[Patmos]]\n* [[Textual variants in the New Testament#Book of Revelation|Textual variants in the Book of Revelation]]\n* [[Vespasian]]\n* [[Woman of the Apocalypse]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n<!-- this verifies what precisely? academic boosterism? self-published?{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Kim Mark|title=How John Wrote the Book of Revelation: From Concept to Publication|date=2015|publisher=Kim Mark Lewis|location=Lorton, VA|isbn=978-1-943325-00-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ajYCgAAQBAJ}}-->\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last = Ammannati\n|first = Renato\n|title = Rivelazione e Storia.
