Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role. Born in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque]] with a [[primordial dwarfism]] condition, dela Cruz started exercising and studied [[karate]]. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by film producers Peter and Cora Caballes of Liliw Productions, and got the pseudonym Weng Weng. Following this, dela Cruz played supporting roles in films, and shared his first top billing with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa'' (1978). Dela Cruz's first lead in the [[action film]] [[Parody film|spoof]] ''Agent OO'' (1981) was followed by two sequels. It became dela Cruz's most well known role, where he demonstrated skills in stunts and martial arts. \n\n''Agent OO's'' sequel ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) that launched dela Cruz to brief but international stardom but also made him a unique figure in [[Cinematography|cinema]]. After it's local release, first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] organised a lavish film festival in the hope to present Filipino films to foreign [[Film distributor|distributor]]. At the high profile event, ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films on foreign sales, while dela Cruz was the mediatic center of attention and the breakthrough star. \n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more films ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. Eventually Peter and Cora Caballes changed professional paths and dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry. Dela Cruz spent the rest of his life with his family in Baclaran and passed away at the age of 34 in 1992.\n\nWith the passing of time, dela Cruz became a cult film icon and an online sensation. A lot of information published about him was unclear or hyperbolic mythos, some with accounts that support them. Research about his life led to the making of two successful documentaries [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010), and Andrew Leavold's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013).\n\n== Early life ==\nDela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz an electrician (1914-1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz a laundry women (1919-1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as followed. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor told her so, and when gave birth, his size was \u201cno bigger than a small coke bottle\u201d. This forced dela Cruz\u2019s parents to place him in a shoe box under a light feeding him with drops. With a medical condition known as [[primordial dwarfism]], it caused dela Cruz to grow to a height of 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meter) tall. Being devoted Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Santo Ni\u00f1o]] each year for the annual Baclaran parade. Dela Cruz became popular in the neighborhood and his mother Rita felt he should become an actor. By 1968, dela Cruz's father passed away due to falling down a ladder at work<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/145619/weng-weng-lives/|title=Weng Weng Lives!|date=2014-01-04|website=Inquirer Lifestyle|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/arts-and-entertainment/weng-weng-a1707-20170425-lfrm|title=The Larger-Than-Life Story of Weng Weng|work=Esquiremag.ph|access-date=2018-08-25}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite AV media |last= Leavold|first= Andrew|date= |title= ''The Search for Weng Weng''| |language= English|type=DVD |location= USA|publisher= Wild Eye Releasing|id= 760137943594}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Celing, as a child dela Cruz was fascinated with action films and started to study them. Neighbours of the dela Cruz started to notice him climbing on clothing lines doing acrobacies and pull ups. Dela Cruz joined [[Karate]] classes, where he learnt quickly, and impressed his instructor. So much so that the instructor would have demonstrations with dela Cruz to promote the school. During one of these demonstration dela Cruz was noticed by producer and actor Peter Caballes of Liliw Productions. Dela Cruz's mother who had a hard time raising five boys, accepted that Peter his wife Cora Ridon Caballes would take dela Cruz under their helm for a film career.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 1975 to 1981: Early roles and breakthrough ===\nDela Cruz started to work almost exclusively with Liliw Productions, starting with an uncredited role, ''Silakbo'', released October 17, 1975.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=229}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, dela Cruz billed as Weng Weng, which would be his pseudonym for the rest of his career, acted in ''Silang Matatapang'' and ''Sila...Sa Bawat Bangketa.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=229}}</ref>''\n\nIn 1978, dela Cruz shared the top billing with actor [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=230-231}}</ref>\n\nAccording to local comic star Rodolfo Vera Quizon Sr., better known as [[Dolphy]], he was introduced to dela Cruz through his friend Peter Caballes, who felt he would be an asset in a [[comedy film]].

As well as taking care of dela Cruz's training for the rest of his career, Nicart also expanded his training in karate and acting. Nicart doubted dela Cruz's suitability for the role due to his intellectual and physical limitations, but changed his mind when he realized how collaborative he could be, and how his bravery allowed him never to refuse a stunt.<ref name=\":0\" /> On June 12, ''Da Best In Da West'' was released with Dolphy starring and dela Cruz in a minor role.

Nicart went on to say that the Caballes treated dela Cruz like a dog, would ask him to leave the room in any business meeting, and that gave him the equivalent of $ 500 per film, while they were wealthy owning several mansions. On that matter Anderson felt that dela Cruz was treated like puppet by everyone and the Caballes too possessive. Cortez said, while working on the first film where dela Cruz received the top billing and considering the fact that the dela Cruz's producers took care of his basic needs, Cortez suspected that at the time he wasn't well compensated. Cortez said he saw dela Cruz arrive on set not in his private car but utility vehicle, he went on to say that it is unacceptable to do so with a leading man.

Nicart also worked to polish dela Cruz's acting, advanced Karate lessons for fight choreography, as well as stunts. Nicart said and praised his footwork, and his fearlessness when it came to stunts. Nicart, also said that he originally had doubt on dela Cruz leading a film, but found him to be so collaborative and fearless, having never refused any stunt, that soon enough he sensed that dela Cruz would become famous. On dela Cruz's talent, [[Dolphy]] praised his comic timing and martial arts skills, while Guerrero thinks highly of his acting abilities.\n\nCeling and Nicart said while dela Cruz had a good grasp of what was going around him, but was mentally slow. Guerrero described that dela Cruz had the mind of a ten-year-old and said that dela Cruz believed anything he said, whether it was real or imaginary. Rez Cortez who acted in two film with dela Cruz said that he had trouble getting in touch with his emotions in order to express them. Cortez recalls once asking dela Cruz if he was lonely for which he replied yes I cried. Cortez and Roland Dantes also asserted that dela Cruz had his own sense of reality. Catral said she never noticed dela Cruz's childlike personality. She felt he had a good grip of what was going on and she had adult conversations with dela Cruz. She said he had an odd sense of humor, and maybe that was what others felt.<ref name=\":5\" />  Anderson described him as complex adult, with an unexplored side.\n\nDela Cruz's has several friendships throughout his career. Guerrero describes that the first time he met dela Cruz children were around and did not know what to make him, and when he spoke the little girls got scared. From that point on they became friends. When they shared company, dela Cruz would always make him laugh. A fond memory he holds, is that dela Cruz often taunted him to go sparring, where he would pretend to be way too scared to go along.<ref name=\":0\" /> Anderson's account of the of his friendship with dela Cruz was at time when both were under contract with Liliw Production. Which he describes as being polluted by the possessive attitude of producers Peter and Cora Caballes. When he started socializing with dela Cruz, he noticed the his potential and felt he was put down by others. Anderson found dela Cruz brave, while wanting to be prudent with him de la Cruz was upset at the idea of wearing a belt and helmet while riding with him on his motorcycle. According to him, a man once provoked dela Cruz by tapping his hand on his head and dela Cruz was ready to fight and wasn't afraid of his size, and Anderson had to separate them. He also recalls bringing dela Cruz at an [[Art film|Art house]] cinema named Mabini to introduce him to [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] films. Dela Cruz was enthralled by them. Together they watched [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' (1950), [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Dela Cruz was particularly fond of [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), according to Anderson, on his first viewing dela Cruz cried. They agreed to make an action comedy remake with a human touch. As soon as Anderson started voicing his concerns regarding both dangerous working conditions and mispayments to the Caballes, the Caballes separated them. They would tell him that dela Cruz was absent when he wasn't. Anderson parted ways with the company, never to see him again.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=180-181}}</ref> Catral stated she had some affection for dela Cruz, would prefer to hang with him instead of other crew member, and when she stopped acting to go to law school she made sure to say goodbye to only two actors, dela Cruz and [[Dolphy]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nDela Cruz became friends with president [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand Marco]] and his [[Marcos family|family]], and on several occasions he joined their company.

She went on to say that it was with her brother [[Bongbong Marcos|Bongbong]] with whom dela Cruz was the closest. Former first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] said the following about dela Cruz: The appearance of Weng Weng showed the great Filipino spirit. They can make a hero of a disabled, distorted guy.

Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role. Born in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque]] with a [[primordial dwarfism]] condition, dela Cruz started exercising and studied [[karate]]. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by film producers Peter and Cora Caballes of Liliw Productions, and got the pseudonym Weng Weng. Following this, dela Cruz played supporting roles in films, and shared his first top billing with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa'' (1978). Dela Cruz's first lead in the [[action film]] [[Parody film|spoof]] ''Agent OO'' (1981) was followed by two sequels. It became dela Cruz's most well known role, where he demonstrated skills in stunts and martial arts. \n\n''Agent OO's'' sequel ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) that launched dela Cruz to brief but international stardom but also made him a unique figure in [[Cinematography|cinema]]. After it's local release, first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] organised a lavish film festival in the hope to present Filipino films to foreign [[Film distributor|distributor]]. At the high profile event, ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films on foreign sales, while dela Cruz was the mediatic center of attention and the breakthrough star. \n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more films ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. Eventually Peter and Cora Caballes changed professional paths and dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry. Dela Cruz spent the rest of his life with his family in Baclaran and passed away at the age of 34 in 1992.\n\nWith the passing of time, dela Cruz became a cult film icon and an online sensation. A lot of information published about him was unclear or hyperbolic mythos, some with accounts that support them. Research about his life led to the making of two successful widely release documentaries [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010), and Andrew Leavold's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013).\n\n== Early life ==\nDela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz an electrician (1914-1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz a laundry women (1919-1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as followed. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor told her so, and when gave birth, his size was \u201cno bigger than a small coke bottle\u201d. This forced dela Cruz\u2019s parents to place him in a shoe box under a light feeding him with drops. With a medical condition known as [[primordial dwarfism]], it caused dela Cruz to grow to a height of 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meter) tall. Being devoted Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Santo Ni\u00f1o]] each year for the annual Baclaran parade. Dela Cruz became popular in the neighborhood and his mother Rita felt he should become an actor. By 1968, dela Cruz's father passed away due to falling down a ladder at work<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/145619/weng-weng-lives/|title=Weng Weng Lives!|date=2014-01-04|website=Inquirer Lifestyle|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/arts-and-entertainment/weng-weng-a1707-20170425-lfrm|title=The Larger-Than-Life Story of Weng Weng|work=Esquiremag.ph|access-date=2018-08-25}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite AV media |last= Leavold|first= Andrew|date= |title= ''The Search for Weng Weng''| |language= English|type=DVD |location= USA|publisher= Wild Eye Releasing|id= 760137943594}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Celing, as a child dela Cruz was fascinated with action films and started to study them.

They said that they adopted dela Cruz ten years prior to the release of ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) to help him. Contemporary action film star [[Rez Cortez]], Franco Guerrero, and Nelson Anderson, who are critical of the couple, have asserted that with the Caballes dela Cruz was provided shelter, received a per diem that was higher than most salaries considering where dela Cruz from and travelled the world. Countries visited by dela Cruz includes [[France]], and [[United States]]. Film editor Edgardo \"Boy\" Vinarao, said that from his point of view dela Cruz was treated like a little prince.<ref name=\":0\" /> Aside from Vinarao's account, those of Cortez, Guerrero, Anderson, as well as [[Roland Dantes]], Busty Santos, and director Eddie Nicard found the financial treatment of dela Cruz's by the Caballes appalling.

Celing added that dela Cruz was abandoned by the Caballes when they had a career change, became completely absent when dela Cruz became paralyzed after his first stroke and the only thing that was provided beyond this point was dela Cruz's casket paid by Peter, while Cora paid for the service once visited by another of their brother, and that [[Lotis Key]] was the only celebrity to attend.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=201-202|chapter=The death of the Pinoy action king}}</ref>\n\nOn dela Cruz's work conditions, Celing said he was never fully paid what he was owed as according to him the Caballes promised their mother that they buy them a house. Nicart went on to say that the Caballes treated dela Cruz like a dog, would ask him to leave the room in any business meeting, and that gave him the equivalent of $ 500 per film, while they were wealthy owning several mansions. On that matter Anderson felt that dela Cruz was treated like puppet by everyone and the Caballes too possessive. Cortez said, while working on the first film where dela Cruz received the top billing and considering the fact that the dela Cruz's producers took care of his basic needs, Cortez suspected that at the time he wasn't well compensated. Cortez said he saw dela Cruz arrive on set not in his private car but utility vehicle, he went on to say that it is unacceptable to do so with a leading man. While feeling dela Cruz deserved a better compensation, Cortez concluded that he was probably happy, considering where he came from and to get a great deal of life experiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn dela Cruz's work ethic, director Nicart, who was a former actor and stuntman for a company named SOS Daredevils, had doubt due to dela Cruz's limitations and went on to say that dela Cruz didn't know how to read a script. Prior the shoot of their first film ''Agent OO'' (1981) for the rest of his career dela Cruz received his training by Nicart who trained his the same way he was. Nicart also worked to polish dela Cruz's acting, advanced Karate lessons for fight choreography, as well as stunts. Nicart said and praised his footwork, and his fearlessness when it came to stunts. Nicart, also said that he originally had doubt on dela Cruz leading a film, but found him to be so collaborative and fearless, having never refused any stunt, that soon enough he sensed that dela Cruz would become famous. On dela Cruz's talent, [[Dolphy]] praised his comic timing and martial arts skills, while Guerrero thinks highly of his acting abilities.\n\nCeling and Nicart said while dela Cruz had a good grasp of what was going around him, but was mentally slow. Guerrero described that dela Cruz had the mind of a ten-year-old and said that dela Cruz believed anything he said, whether it was real or imaginary. Rez Cortez who acted in two film with dela Cruz said that he had trouble getting in touch with his emotions in order to express them. Cortez recalls once asking dela Cruz if he was lonely for which he replied yes I cried. Cortez and Roland Dantes also asserted that dela Cruz had his own sense of reality. Catral said she never noticed dela Cruz's childlike personality. She felt he had a good grip of what was going on and she had adult conversations with dela Cruz. She said he had an odd sense of humor, and maybe that was what others felt.<ref name=\":5\" />  Anderson described him as complex adult, with an unexplored side.\n\nDela Cruz's has several friendships throughout his career. Guerrero describes that the first time he met dela Cruz children were around and did not know what to make him, and when he spoke the little girls got scared. From that point on they became friends. When they shared company, dela Cruz would always make him laugh. A fond memory he holds, is that dela Cruz often taunted him to go sparring, where he would pretend to be way too scared to go along.<ref name=\":0\" /> Anderson's account of the of his friendship with dela Cruz was at time when both were under contract with Liliw Production. Which he describes as being polluted by the possessive attitude of producers Peter and Cora Caballes. When he started socializing with dela Cruz, he noticed the his potential and felt he was put down by others. Anderson found dela Cruz brave, while wanting to be prudent with him de la Cruz was upset at the idea of wearing a belt and helmet while riding with him on his motorcycle. According to him, a man once provoked dela Cruz by tapping his hand on his head and dela Cruz was ready to fight and wasn't afraid of his size, and Anderson had to separate them. He also recalls bringing dela Cruz at an [[Art film|Art house]] cinema named Mabini to introduce him to [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] films. Dela Cruz was enthralled by them. Together they watched [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' (1950), [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Dela Cruz was particularly fond of [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), according to Anderson, on his first viewing dela Cruz cried. They agreed to make an action comedy remake with a human touch. As soon as Anderson started voicing his concerns regarding both dangerous working conditions and mispayments to the Caballes, the Caballes separated them. They would tell him that dela Cruz was absent when he wasn't. Anderson parted ways with the company, never to see him again.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=180-181}}</ref> Catral stated she had some affection for dela Cruz, would prefer to hang with him instead of other crew member, and when she stopped acting to go to law school she made sure to say goodbye to only two actors, dela Cruz and [[Dolphy]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nDela Cruz became friends with president [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand Marco]] and his [[Marcos family|family]], and on several occasions he joined their company.

These two were followed in service by the similarly-named [[Airspeed Queen Wasp]] and [[Miles Martinet|Miles Queen Martinet]], before ultimate replacement by the [[GAF Jindivik]].<ref>Note; the term \"[[Drone (bee)|drone]]\" refers to the male bee that serves only to fertilize the [[queen bee]], hence the use of the name in reference to the DH Queen Bee aerial target.</ref>\n\nThe term ''unmanned aircraft system'' ('''UAS''') was adopted by the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) and the United States [[Federal Aviation Administration]] in 2005 according to their Unmanned Aircraft System Roadmap 2005\u20132030.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/usd/Roadmap%20Final2.pdf#search=%22Dod%20UAS%20Roadmap%202005%22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002220516/http://www.acq.osd.mil/usd/Roadmap%20Final2.pdf#search=%22Dod%20UAS%20Roadmap%202005%22|url-status=dead|title=Unmanned Aircraft Systems Roadmap.|archivedate=2 October 2008}}</ref> The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) and the [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|British Civil Aviation Authority]] adopted this term, also used in the European Union's [[SESAR Joint Undertaking|Single-European-Sky (SES) Air-Traffic-Management (ATM) Research]] (SESAR Joint Undertaking) roadmap for 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title = European ATM Master Plan 2015 {{!}} SESAR|url = http://www.sesarju.eu/newsroom/brochures-publications/european-atm-master-plan-2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160206104147/http://www.sesarju.eu/newsroom/brochures-publications/european-atm-master-plan-2015|url-status = dead|archive-date = 6 February 2016|website = www.sesarju.eu|access-date = 3 February 2016}}</ref> This term emphasizes the importance of elements other than the aircraft. It includes elements such as ground control stations, data links and other support equipment. A similar term is an ''unmanned-aircraft vehicle system'' (UAVS), ''remotely piloted aerial vehicle'' (RPAV), ''remotely piloted aircraft system'' (RPAS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spatialsource.com.au/unmanned/state-government-gears-autonomous-rpas-mapping|title=State government gears up for autonomous RPAS mapping|date=23 January 2017}}</ref> Many similar terms are in use.\n\nA UAV is defined as a \"powered, aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator, uses [[Aerodynamic force|aerodynamic forces]] to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Unmanned+Aerial+Vehicle|title=unmanned aerial vehicle|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> Therefore, [[missile]]s are not considered UAVs because the vehicle itself is a weapon that is not reused, though it is also uncrewed and in some cases remotely guided.

This could stem from the fact that many UAVs are automated, i.e. they carry out automated missions but still rely on human operators.

The main exceptions are the [[cockpit]] and [[Environmental control system (aircraft)|environmental control system]] or [[life support system]]s. Some UAVs carry payloads (such as a camera) that weigh considerably less than an adult human, and as a result can be considerably smaller. Though they carry heavy payloads, weaponized military UAVs are lighter than their crewed counterparts with comparable armaments.\n\nSmall civilian UAVs have no [[life-critical system]]s, and can thus be built out of lighter but less sturdy materials and shapes, and can use less robustly tested electronic control systems. For small UAVs, the [[quadcopter]] design has become popular, though this layout is rarely used for crewed aircraft. Miniaturization means that less-powerful propulsion technologies can be used that are not feasible for crewed aircraft, such as small electric motors and batteries.\n\nControl systems for UAVs are often different than crewed craft. For remote human control, a camera and video link almost always replace the cockpit windows; radio-transmitted digital commands replace physical cockpit controls. [[Autopilot]] software is used on both crewed and uncrewed aircraft, with varying feature sets.\n\n===Body===\nThe primary difference for planes is the absence of the cockpit area and its windows. Tailless quadcopters are a common form factor for rotary wing UAVs while tailed mono- and bi-copters are common for crewed platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/amp/2016/10/02/hybrid-drone-flies-with-one-propeller/|title=Drone flies as both biplane and helicopter using one propeller|website=Engadget}}</ref>\n\n===Power supply and platform===\nSmall UAVs mostly use [[Lithium polymer battery|lithium-polymer batteries]] (Li-Po), while larger vehicles rely on conventional airplane engines. Scale or size of aircraft is not the defining or limiting characteristic of energy supply for a UAV. At present,{{when|date=August 2018}} the energy density of Li-Po is far less than gasoline. The record of travel for a UAV (built from balsa wood and mylar skin) across the North Atlantic Ocean is held by a gasoline model airplane or UAV. Manard Hill in \"in 2003 when one of his creations flew 1,882 miles across the Atlantic Ocean on less than a gallon of fuel\" holds this record. See:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/model-airplane-history-maker-maynard-hill-dies-at-the-age-of-85/2011/06/08/AGcnyQNH_story.html|title=Model airplane history-maker Maynard Hill dies at the age of 85|website=Washington Post}}</ref> Electric power is used as less work is required for a flight and electric motors are quieter. Also, properly designed, the thrust to weight ratio for an electric or gasoline motor driving a propeller can hover or climb vertically.

Early UAVs had only [[narrowband]] uplink. Downlinks came later. These bi-directional narrowband radio links carried command and control (C&C) and [[telemetry]] data about the status of aircraft systems to the remote operator. For very long range flights, military UAVs also use [[satellite]] receivers as part of [[satellite navigation]] systems. In cases when video transmission was required, the UAVs will implement a separate analog video radio link.\n\nIn the most modern UAV applications, video transmission is required. So instead of having 2 separate links for C&C, telemetry and video traffic, a [[broadband]] link is used to carry all types of data on a single radio link.

These two were followed in service by the similarly-named [[Airspeed Queen Wasp]] and [[Miles Martinet|Miles Queen Martinet]], before ultimate replacement by the [[GAF Jindivik]].<ref>Note; the term \"[[Drone (bee)|drone]]\" refers to the male bee that serves only to fertilize the [[queen bee]], hence the use of the name in reference to the DH Queen Bee aerial target.</ref>\n\nThe term ''unmanned aircraft system'' ('''UAS''') was adopted by the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) and the United States [[Federal Aviation Administration]] in 2005 according to their Unmanned Aircraft System Roadmap 2005\u20132030.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/usd/Roadmap%20Final2.pdf#search=%22Dod%20UAS%20Roadmap%202005%22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002220516/http://www.acq.osd.mil/usd/Roadmap%20Final2.pdf#search=%22Dod%20UAS%20Roadmap%202005%22|url-status=dead|title=Unmanned Aircraft Systems Roadmap.|archivedate=2 October 2008}}</ref> The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) and the [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|British Civil Aviation Authority]] adopted this term, also used in the European Union's [[SESAR Joint Undertaking|Single-European-Sky (SES) Air-Traffic-Management (ATM) Research]] (SESAR Joint Undertaking) roadmap for 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title = European ATM Master Plan 2015 {{!}} SESAR|url = http://www.sesarju.eu/newsroom/brochures-publications/european-atm-master-plan-2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160206104147/http://www.sesarju.eu/newsroom/brochures-publications/european-atm-master-plan-2015|url-status = dead|archive-date = 6 February 2016|website = www.sesarju.eu|access-date = 3 February 2016}}</ref> This term emphasizes the importance of elements other than the aircraft. It includes elements such as ground control stations, data links and other support equipment. A similar term is an ''unmanned-aircraft vehicle system'' (UAVS), ''remotely piloted aerial vehicle'' (RPAV), ''remotely piloted aircraft system'' (RPAS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spatialsource.com.au/unmanned/state-government-gears-autonomous-rpas-mapping|title=State government gears up for autonomous RPAS mapping|date=23 January 2017}}</ref> Many similar terms are in use.\n\nA UAV is defined as a \"powered, aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator, uses [[Aerodynamic force|aerodynamic forces]] to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Unmanned+Aerial+Vehicle|title=unmanned aerial vehicle|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> Therefore, [[missile]]s are not considered UAVs because the vehicle itself is a weapon that is not reused, though it is also uncrewed and in some cases remotely guided.

This could stem from the fact that many UAVs are automated, i.e. they carry out automated missions but still rely on human operators. However, an autonomous drone is a \u201cUAV that can operate without any human intervention\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Avitan |first1=Ariel |title=The Differences Between UAV, UAS, and Autonomous Drones |url=https://percepto.co/what-are-the-differences-between-uav-uas-and-autonomous-drones/ |website=Percepto |accessdate=16 April 2020 |date=3 January 2019}}</ref> In other words, autonomous drones take off, carry out missions, and land completely autonomously.

The main exceptions are the [[cockpit]] and [[Environmental control system (aircraft)|environmental control system]] or [[life support system]]s. Some UAVs carry payloads (such as a camera) that weigh considerably less than an adult human, and as a result can be considerably smaller. Though they carry heavy payloads, weaponized military UAVs are lighter than their crewed counterparts with comparable armaments.\n\nSmall civilian UAVs have no [[life-critical system]]s, and can thus be built out of lighter but less sturdy materials and shapes, and can use less robustly tested electronic control systems. For small UAVs, the [[quadcopter]] design has become popular, though this layout is rarely used for crewed aircraft. Miniaturization means that less-powerful propulsion technologies can be used that are not feasible for crewed aircraft, such as small electric motors and batteries.\n\nControl systems for UAVs are often different than crewed craft. For remote human control, a camera and video link almost always replace the cockpit windows; radio-transmitted digital commands replace physical cockpit controls. [[Autopilot]] software is used on both crewed and uncrewed aircraft, with varying feature sets.\n\n===Body===\nThe primary difference for planes is the absence of the cockpit area and its windows. Tailless quadcopters are a common form factor for rotary wing UAVs while tailed mono- and bi-copters are common for crewed platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/amp/2016/10/02/hybrid-drone-flies-with-one-propeller/|title=Drone flies as both biplane and helicopter using one propeller|website=Engadget}}</ref>\n\n===Power supply and platform===\nSmall UAVs mostly use [[Lithium polymer battery|lithium-polymer batteries]] (Li-Po), while larger vehicles rely on conventional airplane engines. Scale or size of aircraft is not the defining or limiting characteristic of energy supply for a UAV. At present,{{when|date=August 2018}} the energy density of Li-Po is far less than gasoline. The record of travel for a UAV (built from balsa wood and mylar skin) across the North Atlantic Ocean is held by a gasoline model airplane or UAV. Manard Hill in \"in 2003 when one of his creations flew 1,882 miles across the Atlantic Ocean on less than a gallon of fuel\" holds this record. See:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/model-airplane-history-maker-maynard-hill-dies-at-the-age-of-85/2011/06/08/AGcnyQNH_story.html|title=Model airplane history-maker Maynard Hill dies at the age of 85|website=Washington Post}}</ref> Electric power is used as less work is required for a flight and electric motors are quieter. Also, properly designed, the thrust to weight ratio for an electric or gasoline motor driving a propeller can hover or climb vertically.

Early UAVs had only [[narrowband]] uplink. Downlinks came later. These bi-directional narrowband radio links carried command and control (C&C) and [[telemetry]] data about the status of aircraft systems to the remote operator. For very long range flights, military UAVs also use [[satellite]] receivers as part of [[satellite navigation]] systems. In cases when video transmission was required, the UAVs will implement a separate analog video radio link.\n\nIn the most modern UAV applications, video transmission is required. So instead of having 2 separate links for C&C, telemetry and video traffic, a [[broadband]] link is used to carry all types of data on a single radio link. These broadband links can leverage [[quality of service]] techniques to optimize the C&C traffic for low latency. Usually these broadband links carry [[TCP/IP]] traffic that can be routed over the Internet.\n\nThe radio signal from the operator side can be issued from either:\n\n* Ground control \u2013 a human operating a [[Transmitter|radio transmitter]]/receiver, a smartphone, a tablet, a computer, or the original meaning of a [[Ground control station|military ground control station (GCS)]].

As of 2016 the low-layer loops (i.e. for flight control) tick as fast as 32,000 times per second, while higher-level loops may cycle once per second. The principle is to decompose the aircraft's behavior into manageable \"chunks\", or states, with known transitions. Hierarchical control system types range from simple [[scripting language|scripts]] to [[finite-state machine|finite state machines]], [[behavior tree]]s and [[hierarchical task network|hierarchical task planners]]. The most common control mechanism used in these layers is the [[PID controller]] which can be used to achieve hover for a [[quadcopter]] by using data from the [[inertial measurement unit|IMU]] to calculate precise inputs for the electronic speed controllers and motors.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nExamples of mid-layer algorithms:\n\n* Path planning: determining an optimal path for vehicle to follow while meeting mission objectives and constraints, such as obstacles or fuel requirements\n* Trajectory generation ([[motion planning]]): determining control maneuvers to take in order to follow a given path or to go from one location to another<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Comparison of Parallel Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization for Real-Time UAV Path Planning|journal = IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics|date = 1 February 2013|issn = 1551-3203|pages = 132\u2013141|volume = 9|issue = 1|doi = 10.1109/TII.2012.2198665|first = V.|last = Roberge|first2 = M.|last2 = Tarbouchi|first3 = G.|last3 = Labonte}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Autonomous UAV path planning and estimation|journal = IEEE Robotics Automation Magazine|date = 1 June 2009|issn = 1070-9932|pages = 35\u201342|volume = 16|issue = 2|doi = 10.1109/MRA.2009.932529|first = J.|last = Tisdale|first2 = ZuWhan|last2 = Kim|first3 = J.K.|last3 = Hedrick}}</ref>\n* Trajectory regulation: constraining a vehicle within some tolerance to a trajectory\nEvolved UAV hierarchical task planners use methods like state [[Tree search algorithm|tree searches]] or [[genetic algorithm]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCE2014/WCE2014_pp551-557.pdf|title = UAV Path Planning with Parallel Genetic Algorithms on CUDA Architecture|date = 2014|access-date = |website = World congress on engineering|last = Cekmez, Ozsiginan, Aydin And Sahingoz}}</ref>\n\n=== Autonomy features ===\n[[File:Degrees of autonomy.jpg|thumb|UAV's degrees of autonomy]]\nUAV manufacturers often build in specific autonomous operations, such as:\n\n* Self-level: attitude stabilization on the pitch and roll axes.\n* Altitude hold: The aircraft maintains its altitude using barometric pressure and/or GPS data. \n* Hover/position hold: Keep level pitch and roll, stable yaw heading and altitude while maintaining position using [[GNSS]] or inertal sensors.\n* Headless mode: Pitch control relative to the position of the pilot rather than relative to the vehicle's axes. \n* Care-free: automatic roll and yaw control while moving horizontally\n* Take-off and landing (using a variety of aircraft or ground-based sensors and systems; see also:[[Autoland]])\n* Failsafe: automatic landing or return-to-home upon loss of control signal\n* Return-to-home: Fly back to the point of takeoff (often gaining altitude first to avoid possible intervening obstructions such as trees or buildings).\n* Follow-me: Maintain relative position to a moving pilot or other object using GNSS, [[image recognition]] or homing beacon.\n* GPS waypoint navigation: Using GNSS to navigate to an intermediate location on a travel path.\n* Orbit around an object: Similar to Follow-me but continuously circle a target.\n* Pre-programmed [[aerobatics]] (such as rolls and loops)\n\n== Functions ==\nFull autonomy is available for specific tasks, such as airborne refueling<ref>{{Cite news|title = Watch a step in Navy history: an autonomous drone gets refueled mid-air|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/04/23/watch-a-step-in-aviation-history-an-autonomous-drone-getting-refueled-mid-air/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 23 April 2015|access-date = 3 February 2016|issn = 0190-8286|first = Christian|last = Davenport}}</ref> or ground-based battery switching; but higher-level tasks call for greater computing, sensing and actuating capabilities.

Godine in 1987; a second collection, ''Bethlehem in Broad Daylight'', appeared from the same publisher in 1991. ''Booklist'' described his verse as \"quiet, intimate\" and praised its original style in turning powerful young urban experience into \"an example of how we live, how we suffer and transcend suffering\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/mark-doty |title=Biography|access-date=2016-02-26 |work=Poetry Foundation }}</ref>\n\nDoty's \"Tiara\" was printed in 1990 in an anthology called Poets for Life: Seventy-Six Poets Respond to AIDS. This poem critiques the way society perceived and treated homosexual AIDS sufferers. The 1980s marked the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the United States. The Reagan administration's delayed action to fight AIDS resulted in thousands of deaths, especially among young gay men.<ref>Shilts, Randy. And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic. New York: St. Martin's, 1987.</ref> Some believe the initial reluctance to mobilize was due to homophobia\u2014society was, at the time, uncomfortable with gay sexuality. This poem criticizes the idea that gay men \"invite[d] their own oppression as a consequence of pleasure.\"<ref name=\"Landau, Deborah 1996\">Landau, Deborah. \"How to Live. What to Do: The Poetics and Politics of AIDS.\" American Literature 68.1 (1996): 193-225. JSTOR. Web. 19 Mar. 2016.</ref> The poem's phrase \"he asked for it\" represents this common, unsympathetic opinion about gay men with AIDS. Imagery like \"perfect stasis\" and \"body's paradise\" is used by Doty to paint a future beyond brutality and discrimination for AIDS sufferers. According to Landau, Doty's poems were \"humane and comforting narratives\" that offered hope to people living with HIV and stood in contrast to the hostile climate of the United States.<ref name=\"Landau, Deborah 1996\"/>\n\nHis third book of poetry, ''My Alexandria'' (University of Illinois Press, 1993), reflects the grief, perceptions and new awareness gained in the face of great and painful loss.

Godine in 1987; a second collection, ''Bethlehem in Broad Daylight'', appeared from the same publisher in 1991. ''Booklist'' described his verse as \"quiet, intimate\" and praised its original style in turning powerful young urban experience into \"an example of how we live, how we suffer and transcend suffering\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/mark-doty |title=Biography|access-date=2016-02-26 |work=Poetry Foundation }}</ref>\n\nDoty's \"Tiara\" was printed in 1990 in an anthology called Poets for Life: Seventy-Six Poets Respond to AIDS. This poem critiques the way society perceived and treated homosexual AIDS sufferers. The 1980s marked the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the United States. The Reagan administration's delayed action to fight AIDS resulted in thousands of deaths, especially among young gay men.<ref>Shilts, Randy. And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic. New York: St. Martin's, 1987.</ref> Some believe the initial reluctance to mobilize was due to homophobia\u2014society was, at the time, uncomfortable with gay sexuality. This poem criticizes the idea that gay men \"invite[d] their own oppression as a consequence of pleasure.\"<ref name=\"Landau, Deborah 1996\">Landau, Deborah. \"How to Live. What to Do: The Poetics and Politics of AIDS.\" American Literature 68.1 (1996): 193-225. JSTOR. Web. 19 Mar. 2016.</ref> The poem's phrase \"he asked for it\" represents this common, unsympathetic opinion about gay men with AIDS. Imagery like \"perfect stasis\" and \"body's paradise\" is used by Doty to paint a future beyond brutality and discrimination for AIDS sufferers. According to Landau, Doty's poems were \"humane and comforting narratives\" that offered hope to people living with HIV and stood in contrast to the hostile climate of the United States.<ref name=\"Landau, Deborah 1996\"/>\n\nHis third book of poetry, ''My Alexandria'' (University of Illinois Press, 1993), reflects the grief, perceptions and new awareness gained in the face of great and painful loss. In 1989, Doty's partner Wally Roberts tested positive for [[HIV]].<ref name=\"toibin\">{{citation |title=Love in a Dark Time: And Other Explorations of Gay Lives and Literature |first=Colm |last=Toibin |authorlink=Colm Toibin |year=2002 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-7432-4467-2 |page=241}}</ref> The collection, written while Roberts had not yet become ill, contemplates the prospect of mortality, desperately attempting to find some way of making the prospect of loss even momentarily bearable. ''My Alexandria'' was chosen for the National Poetry Series by [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]], and won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] and the [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize]].
