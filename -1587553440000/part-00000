Contributing factors were good visibility and a fast response from the ferry operators and emergency responders. The report made 34 recommendations, including that engines be tested for resistance to bird strikes at low speeds; development of checklists for dual-engine failures at low altitude, and changes to checklist design in general \"to minimize the risk of flight crewmembers becoming stuck in an inappropriate checklist or portion of a checklist\"; improved pilot training for water landings; provision of life vests on all flights regardless of route, and changes to the locations of vests and other emergency equipment; research into improved wildlife management, and technical innovations on aircraft, to reduce bird strikes; research into possible changes in passenger [[brace position]]s; and research into \"methods of overcoming passengers' inattention\" during preflight safety briefings.<ref name=NTSBMay2010/>{{rp|124}}\n\n[[File:N106US aviation museum.jpg|thumb|N106US on display at [[Carolinas Aviation Museum]]]]\n\nAuthor and pilot [[William Langewiesche]] asserted that insufficient credit was given to the A320's [[fly-by-wire]] design, by which the pilot uses a [[side-stick]] to make control inputs to the flight control computers.

Contributing factors were good visibility and a fast response from the ferry operators and emergency responders. The report made 34 recommendations, including that engines be tested for resistance to bird strikes at low speeds; development of checklists for dual-engine failures at low altitude, and changes to checklist design in general \"to minimize the risk of flight crewmembers becoming stuck in an inappropriate checklist or portion of a checklist\"; improved pilot training for water landings; provision of life vests on all flights regardless of route, and changes to the locations of vests and other emergency equipment; research into improved wildlife management, and technical innovations on aircraft, to reduce bird strikes; research into possible changes in passenger [[brace position]]s; and research into \"methods of overcoming passengers' inattention\" during preflight safety briefings.<ref name=NTSBMay2010/>{{rp|124}}\n\n[[File:N106US aviation museum.jpg|thumb|N106US on display at [[Carolinas Aviation Museum]]]]\n\nAuthor and pilot [[William Langewiesche]] asserted that insufficient credit was given to the A320's [[fly-by-wire]] design, by which the pilot uses a [[side-stick]] to make control inputs to the flight control computers.

Along with the transport role, the A400M can perform [[aerial refuelling]] and [[medical evacuation]] when fitted with appropriate equipment.\n\nThe A400M's [[maiden flight]], originally planned for 2008, took place on 11 December 2009 from [[Seville]], Spain. Between 2009 and 2010, the A400M faced cancellation as a result of development programme delays and cost overruns; however, the customer nations chose to maintain their support for the project. A total of 174 A400M aircraft had been ordered by eight nations by July 2011. In March 2013, the A400M received [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA) certification. The first aircraft was delivered to the French Air Force in August 2013.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nThe project has its origins in the Future International Military Airlifter (FIMA) group, which was established during 1982 by as a [[joint venture]] between [[A\u00e9rospatiale]], [[British Aerospace]] (BAe), [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and [[Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm]] (MBB) with the goal of developing a replacement for both the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] and [[Transall C-160]].<ref name=Hewson>Hewson, R. ''The Vital Guide to Military Aircraft'', 2nd ed. Airlife Press, Ltd. 2001.</ref> Varying requirements and the complications of international politics meant that progress on the initiative was slow. During 1989, Lockheed decided to withdraw from the grouping; it went on to independently develop an upgraded Hercules, the [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules|C-130J Super Hercules]]. With the addition of [[Alenia Aermacchi|Alenia]] of Italy and [[EADS CASA|CASA]] of Spain, the FIMA group became [[Euroflag]].\n\nSince no existing turboprop engine in the western world was powerful enough to reach the projected cruise speed of Mach 0.72, a new engine design was required. Originally, the SNECMA M138 turboprop (based on the [[Snecma M88|M88 core]]) was selected, but this powerplant was found to be incapable of satisfying the requirements.<ref>''A400M: engines.

Retrieved: 15 May 2010.</ref> The A400M is positioned, in terms of size, between the C-130 and the [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]]; it can carry heavier loads than the C-130 and is able to use rough landing strips. Along with the transport role, the A400M can perform [[aerial refuelling]] and [[medical evacuation]] when fitted with appropriate equipment.\n\nThe A400M's [[maiden flight]], originally planned for 2008, took place on 11 December 2009 from [[Seville]], Spain. Between 2009 and 2010, the A400M faced cancellation as a result of development programme delays and cost overruns; however, the customer nations chose to maintain their support for the project. A total of 174 A400M aircraft had been ordered by eight nations by July 2011. In March 2013, the A400M received [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA) certification. The first aircraft was delivered to the French Air Force in August 2013.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nThe project has its origins in the Future International Military Airlifter (FIMA) group, which was established during 1982 by as a [[joint venture]] between [[A\u00e9rospatiale]], [[British Aerospace]] (BAe), [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and [[Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm]] (MBB) with the goal of developing a replacement for both the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] and [[Transall C-160]].<ref name=Hewson>Hewson, R. ''The Vital Guide to Military Aircraft'', 2nd ed. Airlife Press, Ltd. 2001.</ref> Varying requirements and the complications of international politics meant that progress on the initiative was slow. During 1989, Lockheed decided to withdraw from the grouping; it went on to independently develop an upgraded Hercules, the [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules|C-130J Super Hercules]]. With the addition of [[Alenia Aermacchi|Alenia]] of Italy and [[EADS CASA|CASA]] of Spain, the FIMA group became [[Euroflag]].\n\nSince no existing turboprop engine in the western world was powerful enough to reach the projected cruise speed of Mach 0.72, a new engine design was required. Originally, the SNECMA M138 turboprop (based on the [[Snecma M88|M88 core]]) was selected, but this powerplant was found to be incapable of satisfying the requirements.<ref>''A400M: engines.

It contains all primary legislation in force since 1267, and all secondary legislation since 1823; it does not include legislation which was fully repealed prior to 1991. The contents have been revised to reflect legislative changes up to 2002, with material that has been amended since 2002 fully updated and searchable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/changes |title=Legislation.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\n==New Statute Law Database==\n{{tone|section|date=January 2013}}\nIn December 2008 the Statute Law Database team transferred to [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], which meant that the responsibility for the Office of Public Sector Information and SLD websites became the responsibility of one department. A major consideration of the transfer was to enable the rationalisation of the two websites in order to provide one point of access to all UK legislation and in doing so reduce duplication in effort, increase efficiency (for example taking advantage of technological developments to streamline processes) and provide a more user friendly and accessible service across the board. Since December 2008 a considerable amount{{Vague|date=December 2016}} of work has taken place to look at who the customers of the joint services are and look carefully at their requirements.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe content of the new Statute Law Database consists of the combined content of the previous UK Statute Law Database (SLD),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/ |title=Legislation.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116153722/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/ |archivedate=16 November 2009 }}</ref> and the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ |title=Legislation.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524002716/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ |archivedate=24 May 2005 }}</ref> Updated legislation on the new website is the same data as that available on SLD. The only exceptions are a few acts that are being updated by the editorial team that are available on SLD but will not be available on the new site until the revisions are complete and they are ready to be published to SLD and the new website. Many of the revised documents held by SLD are also available in the OPSI dataset as an \"as enacted\" version. The new website combines these so one can switch between the different versions.\n\nAspects of the new site:\n* For the majority of revised legislation, now held the 'as enacted' and 'revised' version. The different versions can be accessed via the buttons in the 'What Version' area on the table of contents.\n* 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons are now available when navigating the content of legislation (this has only been made possible because of the way the legislation is held on the new site).\n* 'Change to Legislation' \u2013 Much work{{Vague|date=December 2016}} has been done in order to make the revised legislation as usable as possible although it is not fully up to date. The development of the new site has allowed us{{Who|date=December 2016}} to take the 'Tables of Legislative Effects' information currently published on SLD and incorporate the 'unapplied effects' into the content of the legislation at provision level.  This means that instead of having to look through the 'Tables of Effects' year by year in order to establish the current position of a piece of legislation, one can access all the outstanding effects when viewing the act. The outstanding effects also include links to the affecting legislation meaning that one can view the amendments more easily.\n* Links in annotations \u2013 all annotations giving authority for amendments that have been applied now contain links to the affecting legislation (on SLD will only be able to do this for amendments carried out post 2002.)\n* Probably one of the main areas of difference from SLD is that the 'attributes' information have been removed from the foot of the provisions in order to make it more meaningful to users.  The 'geographical extent' can now be turned on and off using the 'show geographical extent' button and the 'start date' information is now presented on the 'Timeline of Changes' so as to give the ability to navigate through the legislation at specific points in time.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Background ===\nAccess to statute law in the United Kingdom was, for some time, a difficult matter. As the [[Hansard Society]] noted in 1992, \"[a]t present the accessibility of statute law to users and the wider public is slow, inconvenient, complicated and subject to several impediments. To put it bluntly, it is often very difficult to find out what the text of a law is \u2013 let alone what it means. Something must be done.\"<ref name=\"Zander\">Zander, M., ''The Law-Making Process'', Cambridge University Press, Sixth Edition, 2004, p. 103, {{ISBN|0-521-60989-5}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\n\n==== 1991 to 1995 ====\nThe idea for creating a UK-wide legislation database dates back to 1991 when the government awarded a contract to [[Syntegra]], a [[BT Group|BT]] company previously known as \"Secure Information Systems Limited\", to create a database containing all the [[public Act]]s comprised in the publication ''[[Statutes in Force]]'' together with all amendments made since a \"base date\" of 1 February 1991. The database was delivered by Syntegra in November 1993, but not accepted by the government until Summer 1995 at a cost of \u00a3700,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/aug/17/epublic.guardianweeklytechnologysection|title=Access denied to the laws that govern us|first=Heather|last=Brooke|date=17 August 2006|via=The Guardian}}</ref> The database was originally intended for use by the [[Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (United Kingdom)|Office of the Parliamentary Counsel]], but following testing with the public service it was decided to make it available to legal practitioners and the private sector on a commercial basis, as well as to public libraries and [[Citizens Advice Bureau]]x<!-- note the \"x\" for Bureaux plural of Bureau -->.<ref name=\"Zander\"/>\n\nThe original database consisted of an [[Interleaf]] editorial system which allowed legislation to be held and edited in [[SGML]]. In 1991 there were no plans to make the database available on the internet. The aim of the project was to create an electronic version of ''Statutes In Force'' which would be available on CD-ROM to much the same audience as that to which ''Statutes In Force'' had been available prior to 1991.<ref name=\"talkopsi\">See [[Talk:UK Statute Law Database|Talk page]] for information from staff of the Office of Public Sector Information, 30 August 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 1995 Syntegra developed the first version of the Statute Law Database website.

The combined cost of the contracts was \u00a3458,000.<ref>[http://flourish.org/foi/2005-06-03-statutelaw/Heather%20Brooke%20FOI%20Response.doc Freedom of Information Act response, 1 July 2005]</ref>\n\nA [[content management system]] named '''TSO ActiveText''' (after TSO, [[The Stationery Office]]) is used in the new system to store legislation in [[XML]] with a specific [[Document Type Definition|DTD]]. Documents in ActiveText are fragmented and can be edited using [[XMetaL]] which allows editors to check documents in and out of the database for editing. All the legislation from the original SGML database was converted into XML. After the editorial system was completed, further development began on a new online Statute Law Database '''Enquiry System'''.<ref name=\"talkopsi\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.number7.demon.co.uk/papers/SLD/SLD.htm |title=\"The Statute Law Database\" by Roger Horne |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916154531/http://www.number7.demon.co.uk/papers/SLD/SLD.htm |archivedate=16 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe government's enquiry system was launched on 31 May 2006 with a plan to roll out general access in three phases. The first stage would open the database to a very limited number of users for testing. On 2 August 2006 the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]] (DCA) commenced the second stage of the database project, allowing the system to be tested in use by issuing login details and passwords to a wide range of selected customers including Government users, law librarians, police staff, [[Citizens Advice Bureau]]x and students. The pilot did not specifically include any commercial legal publishers.<ref name=\"talkopsi\"/> Initially, the DCA intended to charge users for access to \"historical law\", but not current law, however, following pressure notably from ''[[The Guardian]]'' and its \"Free Our Data\" campaign, it was announced in October that the system would be free to use.<ref>[http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/general/view=newsarticle.law?GAZETTENEWSID=303233 Law Society Gazette, \"Statutes free on web\", 5 October 2006]</ref> The SPO's Clare Allison revealed nevertheless that the DCA would be \"looking at options that concern the commercial reuse of the data\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/oct/19/epublic.guardianweeklytechnologysection|title=At last, the price is right for access to our laws|first=Heather|last=Brook|date=18 October 2006|via=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nThe delays involved in realising the database led to a number groups requesting the raw data of the legislation in order to put together their own versions. Among those refused access was Julian Todd, the co-creator of the website [[TheyWorkForYou]], who stated \"I can\u2019t comprehend what the DCA thinks it is gaining by not giving us a database dump of the law.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|title=The Times & The Sunday Times}}</ref> Todd had submitted a request under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] for disclosure of the data, but this was refused and he brought an appeal before the [[Information Commissioner's Office|Information Commissioner]].\n\nThe database was finally made available to the public on 20 December 2006. Announcing its launch, [[Catherine Ashton, Baroness Ashton of Upholland|Baroness Ashton]], a Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]], said that \"[t]he Statute Law Database provides an authoritative and easy-to-use historical database of UK statute law. I hope it will be welcomed as a useful tool for professionals who need to keep up with changes to the law as well as those who simply have an interest in historic and current legislation.\"<ref name=\"YRTK\">[http://www.yrtk.org/2006/statute-law-database-launched/ Your Right to Know, 20 December 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513032645/http://www.yrtk.org/2006/statute-law-database-launched/ |date=13 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\n====2007\u2013present====\n{{expand section|date=February 2014}}\n\n==Content==\nThe database contains the text of [[primary legislation]] since 1267 and [[secondary legislation]] issued after 1823, some 80,000 texts.

The contents have been revised to reflect legislative changes up to 2002, with material that has been amended since 2002 fully updated and searchable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/changes |title=Legislation.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\n==New Statute Law Database==\n{{tone|section|date=January 2013}}\nIn December 2008 the Statute Law Database team transferred to [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], which meant that the responsibility for the Office of Public Sector Information and SLD websites became the responsibility of one department. A major consideration of the transfer was to enable the rationalisation of the two websites in order to provide one point of access to all UK legislation and in doing so reduce duplication in effort, increase efficiency (for example taking advantage of technological developments to streamline processes) and provide a more user friendly and accessible service across the board. Since December 2008 a considerable amount{{Vague|date=December 2016}} of work has taken place to look at who the customers of the joint services are and look carefully at their requirements.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe content of the new Statute Law Database consists of the combined content of the previous UK Statute Law Database (SLD),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/ |title=Legislation.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116153722/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/ |archivedate=16 November 2009 }}</ref> and the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ |title=Legislation.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524002716/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ |archivedate=24 May 2005 }}</ref> Updated legislation on the new website is the same data as that available on SLD. The only exceptions are a few acts that are being updated by the editorial team that are available on SLD but will not be available on the new site until the revisions are complete and they are ready to be published to SLD and the new website. Many of the revised documents held by SLD are also available in the OPSI dataset as an \"as enacted\" version. The new website combines these so one can switch between the different versions.\n\nAspects of the new site:\n* For the majority of revised legislation, now held the 'as enacted' and 'revised' version. The different versions can be accessed via the buttons in the 'What Version' area on the table of contents.\n* 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons are now available when navigating the content of legislation (this has only been made possible because of the way the legislation is held on the new site).\n* 'Change to Legislation' \u2013 Much work{{Vague|date=December 2016}} has been done in order to make the revised legislation as usable as possible although it is not fully up to date. The development of the new site has allowed us{{Who|date=December 2016}} to take the 'Tables of Legislative Effects' information currently published on SLD and incorporate the 'unapplied effects' into the content of the legislation at provision level.  This means that instead of having to look through the 'Tables of Effects' year by year in order to establish the current position of a piece of legislation, one can access all the outstanding effects when viewing the act. The outstanding effects also include links to the affecting legislation meaning that one can view the amendments more easily.\n* Links in annotations \u2013 all annotations giving authority for amendments that have been applied now contain links to the affecting legislation (on SLD will only be able to do this for amendments carried out post 2002.)\n* Probably one of the main areas of difference from SLD is that the 'attributes' information have been removed from the foot of the provisions in order to make it more meaningful to users.  The 'geographical extent' can now be turned on and off using the 'show geographical extent' button and the 'start date' information is now presented on the 'Timeline of Changes' so as to give the ability to navigate through the legislation at specific points in time.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Background ===\nAccess to statute law in the United Kingdom was, for some time, a difficult matter. As the [[Hansard Society]] noted in 1992, \"[a]t present the accessibility of statute law to users and the wider public is slow, inconvenient, complicated and subject to several impediments. To put it bluntly, it is often very difficult to find out what the text of a law is \u2013 let alone what it means. Something must be done.\"<ref name=\"Zander\">Zander, M., ''The Law-Making Process'', Cambridge University Press, Sixth Edition, 2004, p. 103, {{ISBN|0-521-60989-5}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\n\n==== 1991 to 1995 ====\nThe idea for creating a UK-wide legislation database dates back to 1991 when the government awarded a contract to [[Syntegra]], a [[BT Group|BT]] company previously known as \"Secure Information Systems Limited\", to create a database containing all the [[public Act]]s comprised in the publication ''[[Statutes in Force]]'' together with all amendments made since a \"base date\" of 1 February 1991. The database was delivered by Syntegra in November 1993, but not accepted by the government until Summer 1995 at a cost of \u00a3700,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/aug/17/epublic.guardianweeklytechnologysection|title=Access denied to the laws that govern us|first=Heather|last=Brooke|date=17 August 2006|via=The Guardian}}</ref> The database was originally intended for use by the [[Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (United Kingdom)|Office of the Parliamentary Counsel]], but following testing with the public service it was decided to make it available to legal practitioners and the private sector on a commercial basis, as well as to public libraries and [[Citizens Advice Bureau]]x<!-- note the \"x\" for Bureaux plural of Bureau -->.<ref name=\"Zander\"/>\n\nThe original database consisted of an [[Interleaf]] editorial system which allowed legislation to be held and edited in [[SGML]]. In 1991 there were no plans to make the database available on the internet. The aim of the project was to create an electronic version of ''Statutes In Force'' which would be available on CD-ROM to much the same audience as that to which ''Statutes In Force'' had been available prior to 1991.<ref name=\"talkopsi\">See [[Talk:UK Statute Law Database|Talk page]] for information from staff of the Office of Public Sector Information, 30 August 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 1995 Syntegra developed the first version of the Statute Law Database website.

The combined cost of the contracts was \u00a3458,000.<ref>[http://flourish.org/foi/2005-06-03-statutelaw/Heather%20Brooke%20FOI%20Response.doc Freedom of Information Act response, 1 July 2005]</ref>\n\nA [[content management system]] named '''TSO ActiveText''' (after TSO, [[The Stationery Office]]) is used in the new system to store legislation in [[XML]] with a specific [[Document Type Definition|DTD]]. Documents in ActiveText are fragmented and can be edited using [[XMetaL]] which allows editors to check documents in and out of the database for editing. All the legislation from the original SGML database was converted into XML. After the editorial system was completed, further development began on a new online Statute Law Database '''Enquiry System'''.<ref name=\"talkopsi\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.number7.demon.co.uk/papers/SLD/SLD.htm |title=\"The Statute Law Database\" by Roger Horne |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916154531/http://www.number7.demon.co.uk/papers/SLD/SLD.htm |archivedate=16 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe government's enquiry system was launched on 31 May 2006 with a plan to roll out general access in three phases. The first stage would open the database to a very limited number of users for testing. On 2 August 2006 the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]] (DCA) commenced the second stage of the database project, allowing the system to be tested in use by issuing login details and passwords to a wide range of selected customers including Government users, law librarians, police staff, [[Citizens Advice Bureau]]x and students. The pilot did not specifically include any commercial legal publishers.<ref name=\"talkopsi\"/> Initially, the DCA intended to charge users for access to \"historical law\", but not current law, however, following pressure notably from ''[[The Guardian]]'' and its \"Free Our Data\" campaign, it was announced in October that the system would be free to use.<ref>[http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/general/view=newsarticle.law?GAZETTENEWSID=303233 Law Society Gazette, \"Statutes free on web\", 5 October 2006]</ref> The SPO's Clare Allison revealed nevertheless that the DCA would be \"looking at options that concern the commercial reuse of the data\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/oct/19/epublic.guardianweeklytechnologysection|title=At last, the price is right for access to our laws|first=Heather|last=Brook|date=18 October 2006|via=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nThe delays involved in realising the database led to a number groups requesting the raw data of the legislation in order to put together their own versions. Among those refused access was Julian Todd, the co-creator of the website [[TheyWorkForYou]], who stated \"I can\u2019t comprehend what the DCA thinks it is gaining by not giving us a database dump of the law.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|title=The Times & The Sunday Times}}</ref> Todd had submitted a request under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] for disclosure of the data, but this was refused and he brought an appeal before the [[Information Commissioner's Office|Information Commissioner]].\n\nThe database was finally made available to the public on 20 December 2006. Announcing its launch, [[Catherine Ashton, Baroness Ashton of Upholland|Baroness Ashton]], a Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]], said that \"[t]he Statute Law Database provides an authoritative and easy-to-use historical database of UK statute law.

Above the globe was a banner that read \"Cruiserweight\" and below the globe was one that read \"Champion\". Ornamentation filled out the rest of the plate. In what has become a prominent feature of WWE's championship belts, the side plates featured removable center sections, allowing the holder's personal logo to be added to the championship belt; the default side plates showed silver and purple world maps with the WWE logo over them. The plates were on a purple strap. During [[Neville (wrestler)|Neville]]'s first reign, the color of the slash under the WWE logo on the center plate and default side plates was changed from purple to orange.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/786663-rich-swann-gets-custom-plates-on-cruiserweight-title-video-bubba-ray-hosting-raw-party-in-freehold-nj|title=Rich Swann Gets Custom Plates On Cruiserweight Title (Video), Bubba Ray Hosting RAW Party In Freehold, NJ|date=December 21, 2016|last=Hausman|first=Nick|work=Wrestle Zone|accessdate=December 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn January 25, 2020, Triple H and NXT General Manager William Regal presented a new NXT branded Cruiserweight Championship belt to then-champion [[Angel Garza]].

The location of origin is obscure, with various scholars tracing it to [[Medieval period|medieval]] [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], England, [[Germany]], or more than one of these areas. More exotic and earlier origins have also been proposed.<ref name=\"Dorion & Shepherd 1928\" /><ref name=\"Twardy 1937\" />\n\n[[File:1674 illustration-The Billiard Table.png|thumb|left|Engraving from [[Charles Cotton]]'s 1674 book, ''The Compleat Gamester'', showing the same game, including port and king, and finely-developed maces, being played on a 17th-century [[pocket billiards]] table]] Even in the late 17th to early 18th centuries, indoor billiards was essentially exactly the same game, with smaller equipment and simply played on a bounded table, with or without pockets.<ref name=\"Clare\" />{{Rp|3, 6, 7}} <ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|57&ndash;67}} Use of the king pin declined first in most areas, followed by the abandonment of the port arch, though many variants featured both as well as pockets,<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|57&ndash;67}} while the king survived and even multiplied in some cases, leading to such modern games as [[five-pins]].

It is clear that bowling, in its ancestral form [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]], shares a common origin with ground billiards, as the two game types share both the basic objective, to direct a rolling ball towards a target, and equipment, aside from the mace.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|43}} Some contemporary sources depict the same game being played both with the hand and with a mace, and show a distinctive teardrop-shaped king pin design,<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|34, 43, 47}} with a rounded, or flattened but wide, bottom. This pin shape suggests that it may have been the origin of the modern bottom-heavy design of [[bowling pin]]s and similar skittles of various sizes used in a wide variety of games.  A conical king or ''jack'', as well as round jacks or {{lang|it|pallinos}} as used in modern [[bowls]], [[boules]], [[bocce]], and [[p\u00e9tanque]], were employed in lawn bowling games at least as early as the thirteenth century in England, and with a similar goal (to get as close to the jack as possible with one's own ball).<ref name=\"Dorion & Shepherd 1928\" /> Similar king-pin shapes are found in depictions and actual surviving game equipment from [[Ancient Egypt]].<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|ch.&nbps;1}}\n\nThe [[Netherlands|Dutch]] game {{lang|nl|[[Kolven#History|het kolven]]}}, a precursor of golf dating to at least the early 13th century, seems to be intermediate between ground billiards on the one hand, and both golf and ice hockey on the other.

For example, in [[Inner Mongolia]] in modern-day [[China]], the [[Daur people|Daur]] people have been playing ''[[beikou]]'', a game similar to modern field hockey, for about 1,000 years.<ref name=\"nyt\" />\n\nStein and Rubino also devote considerable historico-cultural analysis to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian lawn/court and board games with equipment similar to medieval European lawn billiards and to bat-and-ball games, and they much more speculatively suggest that for the Egyptians there may have been rich religious symbology involved. They note the resemblance of the games' ball, shooting stick, and king ping to the [[orb]], the [[sceptre]] or [[ceremonial mace]] (which originally had a [[Crook and flail|crook]] at the top like a gaming mace), and the [[crown]] of imperial [[regalia]], which later were adopted by the [[Roman Empire|pagan Romans]] and ([[Globus cruciger|in modified form]]) in turn by rulers of [[Christendom]]. It is suggestive that games like ground billiards in the medieval Christian world were for centuries primarily the purview of and preserved by the clergy and the nobility, with peasant game-playing suppressed to the extent possible by many rulers, as unproductive.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{rp|ch.&nbsp;1}}\n\n==Game play and equipment==\nThe exact rules of game play, and whether these rules were consistent from region to region, are unknown.  [[England|English]] rules recorded in [[Charles Cotton]]'s ''The Compleat Gamester'' (1674), for an indoor version played on a [[billiards table]], indicate that the general offensive goal of the game is to use a club-like [[Cue stick|cue]], called the ''{{Cuegloss|Mace|mace}}'' or ''tack'', to drive one's own [[Billiard ball|ball]] through a hoop, called the ''pass'', ''port'', ''argolis'', or ''ring'', thus earning a chance to shoot at the upright ''king pin'' or ''sprigg'', and to use defensive {{Cuegloss|Position play|position play}} to thwart an opponent's ability to do likewise, e.g. by {{Cuegloss|Kiss|kissing}} an opposing ball to an unfavorable location.<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /><ref name=\"Shamos 1999 265\" />  Points were scored for touching the king pin with one's ball, without knocking the pin over (which would cost the loss of a point).<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" />  Games were played to a set number of points, such as 5 or 7, and could be between two (or sometimes more) individual competitors or doubles teams, each with one ball.<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> {{Cuegloss|Object ball|Object balls}} were not used, in Cotton's work or in any contemporary illustrations.  Cotton's indoor version made use of [[Pocket (billiards)|pockets]] in the sides of the table as {{Cuegloss|Hazard|hazards}}, with additional scoring opportunities,<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> and some outdoor ground-billiards courts may have used [[golf]]-style holes for the same purpose.<ref name=\"book_TheL\" />\n\nAn outdoor form of the game that survived, sometimes without a king pin, until the early 20th century was [[trucco]], among other names, with rules well-documented in works like the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] advice book ''[[Enquire Within upon Everything]]'', which also called it simply \"lawn billiards\" (and which covered the related game [[croquet]] separately).  Trucco, in this well-documented form, was played in a round area at least {{convert|8|yards}} in diameter, by two players (or more, in two teams). The game used large, heavy balls and iron-headed maces like giant spoons which were used to toss rather than roll one's ball toward the port, by this stage a freely rotating metal ring mounted on a stake, and almost flush with the ground.  Scoring shots included passing one's ball through the port, and striking an opponent's ball with one's own (a {{cuegloss|cannon}} or {{cuegloss|carom}} shot, in billiards terms, or in [[croquet]] called a {{cuegloss|roquet}}). Part of the strategy of this form of the game was using cannon shots to get close enough to the port for a shot at it to be easier (failing to go dead-center would likely result in not just a miss but rotation of the ring to an unpredictable position, or even in knocking the ring down, which was a foul with a penalty).<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" />  A prior form, illustrated in an early-17th-century English painting, shows a smaller and rectangular court, and only one ball between two players.  Some continental forms did involve a king pin.<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" />\n\nThe [[Billiard ball|balls]], mace, and other equipment were probably most commonly made of [[wood]]. ''The Complete Gamester'', covering only the indoor variant, favored by the well-to-do, recommended hardwood such as [[lignum vitae]] for maces, and expensive [[ivory]] for balls and other equipment,<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> but ivory's fragility would have made it impractical for the larger-scale and necessarily more forceful outdoor version of the game. ''Enquire Within'' suggested lignum vitae or [[boxwood]] for the balls. Some illustrations suggest port hoops made of decorative wrought iron, while others are clearly of wood, stone, or another carved substance, and later examples are thin and wiry, similar to modern croquet hoops (wickets).  The nature of the mace appears to move from crude to elegant over time, with earlier illustrations showing simple hammer-like implements, with players stooping, while later woodcuts and tapestries show a long, thin device more like a golf club, and in basic form very similar to later, more delicate and ornate maces used for table billiards before leather-tipped straight cues became the norm in those games.  Similarly, the nature of the playing court appears to evolve from any informal patch of ground to courts of turf or clay bounded by low (often wicker) barriers,<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|4&ndash;47}} though trucco, as an informal game played mostly at pubs and [[country house]]s, could be played anywhere the ground was relatively flat (the conventional Victorian rules simply called for at least {{convert|4|yards}} from the outer edge of the playing area to the ring).<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" /> Most woodcuts and other illustrations of the game show two players. A few show more, but it is unclear if these represent teams, doubles, or individual players.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nA mid-20th-century version of ground billiards (aside from the aforementioned box hockey) has been played on a 30&nbsp;by&nbsp;60&nbsp;[[Foot (length)|ft]] (approximately 9&nbsp;by&nbsp;19&nbsp;[[Metre|m]]) clay court.<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\" />{{Rp|117}}  This may have been a croquet influence, as [[roque]], an early-20th-century [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] variant of croquet, used a court of the same dimensions.<ref name=\"spring.net\" /> The term \"king pin\" or \"kingpin\", which today may refer to essential components of any system, from bosses of [[organized crime]] syndicates, to the main support bolt in the axle assemblies (trucks) of [[skateboard]]s, appears to derive from its usage as a key component of ground billiards, early skittle bowling, and related games.<ref name=\"etym_king\" /> There are some records that some of the early king pins in ground billiards games were made of bone.<ref name=\"book_TheS\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\">{{Shamos 1999}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Clare\">{{Cite book |title=Billiards and Snooker Bygones |last=Clare |first=Norman |publisher=Shire Publications |location=Princes Risborough, England |date=1996 |orig-year=1985 |edition=amended |isbn=978-0-85263-730-2}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Dorion & Shepherd 1928\">{{Cite book |first1=Leila C. |last1=Dorion |first2=Julia A. |last2=Shepherd |title=History of Bowling and Billiards |location=Kansas City, Missouri |publisher=Constable-Hurd Printing Co. |date=1928 |pages=28, 65, 68 |url= http://www.archive.org/details/historyofbowling008027mbp}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Twardy 1937\">{{Cite news |first=E.

Third century&nbsp;BCE [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] has also been proposed.<ref name=\"Dorion & Shepherd 1928\" />  Earlier still, a [[bas relief]] dating to c.&nbsp;600&nbsp;BCE depicts an ancient Greek ball game, a possible ancestor of both ground billiards and field hockey, which may have been called {{lang|grc-Latn|ker\u0113t\u00edzein}} or {{lang|grc-Latn|kerht\u00edzein}} ({{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}}) because it was played with an implement shaped like a horn ({{lang|grc-Latn|k\u00e9ras}}, {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2}}).<ref name=\"boYnz\" /> It appears to be basically the same as the [[Mediaeval Europe]]an activity of c.&nbsp;1300&nbsp;CE.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|2, 5, 27}}  An ancient Greek game said (in 1928) to be \"analogous to billiards\" was reported in contemporary Greek writings around 400&nbsp;BCE.<ref name=\"Dorion & Shepherd 1928\" />\n\nBilliards scholars Victor Stein and Paul Rubino conclude that there is an unbroken chain of game evolution from very widespread prehistoric stick-and-ball games and rituals, through the civilizations of [[classical antiquity]], to modern lawn and cue sports in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|2&ndash;69}}  Even [[polo]], a [[cavalry]]-training sport originating in [[Ancient Persia]], is essentially the same core game, but played on horseback with a longer cue-mallet.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|35, 49}}  A set of gaming pieces, buried with a child dating to c.&nbsp;3300&nbsp;BCE in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], features stone balls, skittles, and an arch (no cue/mace was included in the recovered artifacts).<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|8}} Stein and Rubino, among other researchers, believe that games such as early ball-and-stick activities, chess, and many others were brought into Europe from the [[Near East]] and [[Middle East]] by returning [[Crusade]]rs from the 12th century onward, and that the pastimes were kept alive and evolving on that continent principally by the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Christian clergy]].<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|2&ndash;69}}<ref name=\"Dorion & Shepherd 1928\" />\n\nThe game is often seen as the precursor of many later, more familiar outdoor and indoor games, including [[snooker]], [[nine-ball]], [[croquet]], and [[hockey]], and is described as \"the original game of billiards\" by Stein and Rubino.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" /> Games played with [[Field hockey stick|curved sticks]] and a ball have been found throughout history and the world. For example, in [[Inner Mongolia]] in modern-day [[China]], the [[Daur people|Daur]] people have been playing ''[[beikou]]'', a game similar to modern field hockey, for about 1,000 years.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> [[Polo]], with origins in the central Asian steppes and directly attested since at least the [[Parthian Empire]] (247&nbsp;BCE \u2013 224&nbsp;CE) is essentially same sort of game but adapted to horseback.\n\nStein and Rubino also devote considerable analysis to [[Ancient Egypt]]ian lawn/court and board games with equipment similar to medieval European lawn billiards and to bat-and-ball games. Much more speculatively, they suggest that for the Egyptians there may have been rich religious symbology involved. They note the resemblance of the game's ball, shooting stick, and king ping to the [[orb]], [[sceptre]] or [[ceremonial mace]] (which originally had a [[Crook and flail|crook]] at the top like a gaming mace), and [[crown]] of imperial [[regalia]], which later were adopted by the [[Roman Empire|pagan Romans]] and ([[Globus cruciger|in modified form]]) in turn by rulers of [[Christendom]]. It is suggestive that games like ground billiards in the medieval Christian world were for centuries primarily the purview of and preserved by the clergy and the nobility, with peasant game-playing suppressed to the extent possible by many rulers, as unproductive.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{rp|ch.&nbsp;1}}\n\n==Game play and equipment==\nThe exact rules of game play, and whether these rules were consistent from region to region, are unknown.  [[England|English]] rules recorded in [[Charles Cotton]]'s ''The Compleat Gamester'' (1674), for an indoor version played on a [[billiards table]], indicate that the general offensive goal of the game is to use a club-like [[Cue stick|cue]], called the ''{{Cuegloss|Mace|mace}}'' or ''tack'', to drive one's own [[Billiard ball|ball]] through a hoop, called the ''pass'', ''port'', ''argolis'', or ''ring'', thus earning a chance to shoot at the upright ''king pin'' or ''sprigg'', and to use defensive {{Cuegloss|Position play|position play}} to thwart an opponent's ability to do likewise, e.g. by {{Cuegloss|Kiss|kissing}} an opposing ball to an unfavorable location.<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /><ref name=\"Shamos 1999 265\" />  Points were scored for touching the king pin with one's ball, without knocking the pin over (which would cost the loss of a point).<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" />  Games were played to a set number of points, such as 5 or 7, and could be between two (or sometimes more) individual competitors or doubles teams, each with one ball.<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> {{Cuegloss|Object ball|Object balls}} were not used, in Cotton's work or in any contemporary illustrations.  Cotton's indoor version made use of [[Pocket (billiards)|pockets]] in the sides of the table as {{Cuegloss|Hazard|hazards}}, with additional scoring opportunities,<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> and some outdoor ground-billiards courts may have used [[golf]]-style holes for the same purpose.<ref name=\"book_TheL\" />\n\nAn outdoor form of the game that survived, sometimes without a king pin, until the early 20th century was [[trucco]], among other names, with rules well-documented in works like the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] advice book ''[[Enquire Within upon Everything]]'', which also called it simply \"lawn billiards\" (and which covered the related game [[croquet]] separately).  Trucco, in this well-documented form, was played in a round area at least {{convert|8|yards}} in diameter, by two players (or more, in two teams). The game used large, heavy balls and iron-headed maces like giant spoons which were used to toss rather than roll one's ball toward the port, by this stage a freely rotating metal ring mounted on a stake, and almost flush with the ground.  Scoring shots included passing one's ball through the port, and striking an opponent's ball with one's own (a {{cuegloss|cannon}} or {{cuegloss|carom}} shot, in billiards terms, or in [[croquet]] called a {{cuegloss|roquet}}). Part of the strategy of this form of the game was using cannon shots to get close enough to the port for a shot at it to be easier (failing to go dead-center would likely result in not just a miss but rotation of the ring to an unpredictable position, or even in knocking the ring down, which was a foul with a penalty).<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" />  A prior form, illustrated in an early-17th-century English painting, shows a smaller and rectangular court, and only one ball between two players.  Some continental forms did involve a king pin.<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" />\n\nThe [[Billiard ball|balls]], mace, and other equipment were probably most commonly made of [[wood]]. ''The Complete Gamester'', covering only the indoor variant, favored by the well-to-do, recommended hardwood such as [[lignum vitae]] for maces, and expensive [[ivory]] for balls and other equipment,<ref name=\"Cotton 1674\" /> but ivory's fragility would have made it impractical for the larger-scale and necessarily more forceful outdoor version of the game. ''Enquire Within'' suggested lignum vitae or [[boxwood]] for the balls. Some illustrations suggest port hoops made of decorative wrought iron, while others are clearly of wood, stone, or another carved substance, and later examples are thin and wiry, similar to modern croquet hoops (wickets).  The nature of the mace appears to move from crude to elegant over time, with earlier illustrations showing simple hammer-like implements, with players stooping, while later woodcuts and tapestries show a long, thin device more like a golf club, and in basic form very similar to later, more delicate and ornate maces used for table billiards before leather-tipped straight cues became the norm in those games.  Similarly, the nature of the playing court appears to evolve from any informal patch of ground to courts of turf or clay bounded by low (often wicker) barriers,<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />{{Rp|4&ndash;47}} though trucco, as an informal game played mostly at pubs and [[country house]]s, could be played anywhere the ground was relatively flat (the conventional Victorian rules simply called for at least {{convert|4|yards}} from the outer edge of the playing area to the ring).<ref name=\"EWuE 1884\" /> Most woodcuts and other illustrations of the game show two players. A few show more, but it is unclear if these represent teams, doubles, or individual players.<ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\" />\n\n===Legacy===\nA mid-20th-century version of ground billiards (aside from the aforementioned box hockey) has been played on a 30&nbsp;by&nbsp;60&nbsp;[[Foot (length)|ft]] (approximately 9&nbsp;by&nbsp;19&nbsp;[[Metre|m]]) clay court.<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\" />{{Rp|117}}  This may have been a croquet influence, as [[roque]], an early-20th-century [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] variant of croquet, used a court of the same dimensions.<ref name=\"spring.net\" /> The term \"king pin\" or \"kingpin\", which today may refer to essential components of any system, from bosses of [[organized crime]] syndicates, to the main support bolt in the axle assemblies (trucks) of [[skateboard]]s, appears to derive from its usage as a key component of ground billiards, early skittle bowling, and related games.<ref name=\"etym_king\" /> There are some records that some of the early king pins in ground billiards games were made of bone.<ref name=\"book_TheS\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\">{{Shamos 1999}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Clare\">{{Cite book |title=Billiards and Snooker Bygones |last=Clare |first=Norman |publisher=Shire Publications |location=Princes Risborough, England |date=1996 |orig-year=1985 |edition=amended |isbn=978-0-85263-730-2}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Dorion & Shepherd 1928\">{{Cite book |first1=Leila C. |last1=Dorion |first2=Julia A. |last2=Shepherd |title=History of Bowling and Billiards |location=Kansas City, Missouri |publisher=Constable-Hurd Printing Co. |date=1928 |pages=28, 65, 68 |url= http://www.archive.org/details/historyofbowling008027mbp}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Twardy 1937\">{{Cite news |first=E.
