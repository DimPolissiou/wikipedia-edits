Young was one of nine women in her class of 110. Lectures were mostly men and professors would show nude pictures and cartoons of women were shown during class for entertainment. Young switched out the picture with a nude of a man to embarrass the lecturer. Young met her husband Jack her first year and they continued their relationship while both pursuing careers in Neurology.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFor a year a half, Young completed her required\u00a0medical school courses and clerkships. During the PhD portion of her graduate studies, Young worked with Professor [[Solomon H. Snyder|Solomon Snyder]] on preliminary analyses of potential neurotransmitters, such as homocarnosine and homoanserine. Data from Young\u2019s lab was the first suggesting glutamate as a neurotransmitter in cerebellar granule cells. Young also worked with [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] receptors and found a way to detect inhibitory amino acid receptors using [[neurotoxin]]s.<ref name=\":1\" /> Young developed several collaborative projects with others in the neurology department.

Other labs were also studying neurodegenerative diseases. These labs were spread out, and Young recognized the benefit that would come from bringing these labs together. She proposed an open lab space in a Mass General building. She was given almost an entire building in which the Mass General Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease (MIND) was established. MIND seeks to have a broad focus to study not only the cause of these diseases, but also to develop effective therapeutic techniques. Another important aspect of MIND that Young helped to foster is collaborative teamwork between researchers. MIND has made many contributions to research of neurodegenerative diseases, including a role in the discovery of the gene for Huntington\u2019s disease.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Anne B. Young Translational Medicine Fellowship ====\nThe Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Neurology, partnered with [[Biogen]], offers a [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] in Young\u2019s honor to train fellows to quickly and efficiently perform research and create treatments for neurological disorders.

Through different physical and systems-based research, models of neural networks of Early Stage Huntington\u2019s Disease and Parkinson\u2019s Disease were proposed. The models suggest that different areas of the striatum, previously established as the area of the brain most directly related to the diseases, may be involved in the different steps and features of [[motor control]]. This discovery allowed researchers to pursue research focused on the different areas and types of degradation of the striatum\u00a0correlated with either Parkinson\u2019s or Huntington\u2019s disease.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n* 1989: Excitatory Amino Acids and Alzheimers Disease\n\nIn this paper, Young and her co-author Greenamyre present research on the role of disrupting different [[Amino acid neurotransmitter|excitatory amino acid]] mechanisms in the [[hippocampus]] and [[cerebral cortex]] of the brain.

Young was one of nine women in her class of 110. Lectures were mostly men and professors would show nude pictures and cartoons of women were shown during class for entertainment. Young switched out the picture with a nude of a man to embarrass the lecturer. Young met her husband Jack her first year and they continued their relationship while both pursuing careers in Neurology. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFor a year a half, Young completed her required\u00a0medical school courses and clerkships. During the PhD portion of her graduate studies, Young worked with Professor [[Solomon H.

Other labs were also studying neurodegenerative diseases. These labs were spread out, and Young recognized the benefit that would come from bringing these labs together. She proposed an open lab space in a Mass General building. She was given almost an entire building in which the Mass General Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease (MIND) was established. MIND seeks to have a broad focus to study not only the cause of these diseases, but also to develop effective therapeutic techniques. Another important aspect of MIND that Young helped to foster is collaborative teamwork between researchers.

Coastal fortifications were built along [[Tokyo Bay]] as far south as Tateyama to protect the capital of the [[Japanese Empire]] from attack. In the 1930s the north and central areas of the prefecture became a center of large-scale military production, and military bases and fortifications were constructed in most coastal areas of the prefecture. After the [[United States]] took control of [[Saipan]] the northern part of the prefecture, most notably the city of Chiba and Ch\u014dshi, were [[firebombed]]. Much of the industrialized north of the prefecture was destroyed. [[Operation Downfall#Coronet|Operation Coronet]], one of two parts of [[Operation Downfall]], was the planned land invasion of Tokyo in March 1946 by the United States. Coronet planned [[Kuj\u016bkuri Beach]] as one of two initial landing bases, the other being [[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa|Hiratsuka]] via [[Sagami Bay]]. The [[U.S. First Army]] would enter at Kuj\u016bkuri, sweep across the [[B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula]], and meet the [[U.S. Eighth Army]] at Tokyo. After the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] but due to the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, the plan was never carried out.<ref>{{cite book | last = Giangreco | first = D.

Numerous other cities in the prefecture, including Ch\u014dshi to the north and Tateyama to the south, were used as bases of the occupation. The rich agriculture areas across the prefecture protected the region somewhat from the level of food shortage and starvation immediately following the war. The immediate post-war period was characterized by carefully planned industrial expansion in the north of the prefecture and the significant increase of agricultural production after [[land reform]]s across the prefecture. The [[Keiy\u014d Industrial Zone]] brought together smaller industrial areas along the entirety of the western coast of Chiba Prefecture, and the industrial zone became, and remains an important center of heavy industrial production and large-scale port facilities in Japan. Cities to the northeast of the prefecture in close proximity to Tokyo were connected by rail to the capitol, and became and remain [[bedroom communities]] to Tokyo. [[Narita International Airport]] began operation in 1978 in [[Narita, Chiba|Narita]] after much protest to replace the overcrowded  [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo International Airport]] (Haneda Airport). The majority of international air traffic enters Japan via Chiba Prefecture. Agriculture, specifically of [[rice]], and also vegetables to serve the [[Greater Tokyo Area|Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area]] expanded greatly and became a source of income to the northeast and central areas of the prefecture. Agriculture expansion of the central and southern regions of the prefecture was in contrast to the depopulation of these areas as a significant part of the population moved to the northeast of the prefecture as a result of the [[urbanization]] of Japan, a process that continues into the 21st century.\n\n===2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami===\n[[File:Cosmo Oil explosion 2 20110311.jpg|left|thumb|[[Cosmo Oil]] Chiba Refinery fire, [[Ichihara, Chiba|Ichihara]], caused by the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]\n\nThe [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] affected areas as far south as Chiba Prefecture.

Coastal fortifications were built along [[Tokyo Bay]] as far south as Tateyama to protect the capital of the [[Japanese Empire]] from attack. In the 1930s the north and central areas of the prefecture became a center of large-scale military production, and military bases and fortifications were constructed in most coastal areas of the prefecture. After the [[United States]] took control of [[Saipan]] the northern part of the prefecture, most notably the city of Chiba and Ch\u014dshi, were [[firebombed]]. Much of the industrialized north of the prefecture was destroyed. [[Operation Downfall#Coronet|Operation Coronet]], one of two parts of [[Operation Downfall]], was the planned land invasion of Tokyo in March 1946 by the United States. Coronet planned [[Kuj\u016bkuri Beach]] as one of two initial landing bases, the other being [[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa|Hiratsuka]] via [[Sagami Bay]]. The [[U.S. First Army]] would enter at Kuj\u016bkuri, sweep across the [[B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula]], and meet the [[U.S. Eighth Army]] at Tokyo.

Numerous other cities in the prefecture, including Ch\u014dshi to the north and Tateyama to the south, were used as bases of the occupation. The rich agriculture areas across the prefecture protected the region somewhat from the level of food shortage and starvation immediately following the war. The immediate post-war period was characterized by carefully planned industrial expansion in the north of the prefecture and the significant increase of agricultural production after [[land reform]]s across the prefecture. The [[Keiy\u014d Industrial Zone]] brought together smaller industrial areas along the entirety of the western coast of Chiba Prefecture, and the industrial zone became, and remains an important center of heavy industrial production and large-scale port facilities in Japan. Cities to the northeast of the prefecture in close proximity to Tokyo were connected by rail to the capitol, and became and remain [[bedroom communities]] to Tokyo. [[Narita International Airport]] began operation in 1978 in [[Narita, Chiba|Narita]] after much protest to replace the overcrowded  [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo International Airport]] (Haneda Airport). The majority of international air traffic enters Japan via Chiba Prefecture. Agriculture, specifically of [[rice]], and also vegetables to serve the [[Greater Tokyo Area|Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area]] expanded greatly and became a source of income to the northeast and central areas of the prefecture. Agriculture expansion of the central and southern regions of the prefecture was in contrast to the depopulation of these areas as a significant part of the population moved to the northeast of the prefecture as a result of the [[urbanization]] of Japan, a process that continues into the 21st century.\n\n===2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami===\n[[File:Cosmo Oil explosion 2 20110311.jpg|left|thumb|[[Cosmo Oil]] Chiba Refinery fire, [[Ichihara, Chiba|Ichihara]], caused by the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]\n\nThe [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] affected areas as far south as Chiba Prefecture.

He is now a composer for film and television.\n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[Manchester]], Gannon had played in bands with friends since he was 12 years old, and in 1983 joined [[Aztec Camera]] after replying to an ad in ''[[Melody Maker]]''. In 1984 he briefly joined [[The Colourfield]], and went on to join [[The Bluebells]].<ref>Kutner, Jon & Leigh, Spencer (2005) \"687: The Bluebells Young at Heart\", in ''1000 UK Number One Hits'', Omnibus Press</ref><ref name=\"Rogan\">Rogan, Johnny (2012) ''Morrissey & Marr: The Severed Alliance (The 20th Anniversary Edition)'', Omnibus Press, {{ISBN|978-1-78038-304-0}}, pp. 400</ref> After another brief stint in The Colourfield, when [[Bassist|bass player]] [[Andy Rourke]] was fired from The Smiths in early 1986, Gannon was hired to replace him. Within a fortnight, however, Rourke was reinstated and Gannon moved to rhythm guitar becoming the official fifth member, playing on the \"[[Panic (The Smiths song)|Panic]]\" and \"[[Ask (song)|Ask]]\" [[single (music)|singles]] and touring the UK,  Canada and the US with the band. Gannon also played on the scrapped single \"You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby\", which was included on ''[[The World Won't Listen]]'' compilation album. After the tour ended in October 1986, Gannon was no longer part of the line-up. Gannon has been affectionately known thereafter as \"the Fifth Smith\".\n\nAfter leaving [[The Smiths]], Gannon joined [[Brix Smith]] in [[The Adult Net]] and [[Blue Orchids]].<ref name=\"Strong\">Strong, Martin C.

The matter was settled out of court for the sum of \u00a344,000. This amount included \u00a330,000 for unpaid wages and \u00a314,000 in legal costs. Gannon composed the music used on the ''Inside The Smiths'' DVD, released by former Smiths Mike Joyce and Andy Rourke. In addition to this, he also appeared in and composed the music for a classic albums DVD of ''The Queen Is Dead'' \u2013 released in May 2008.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Gannon was in the initial lineup of [[Black Grape]].<ref>Larkin, Colin (2007) ''The Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', Bish Bash Books</ref> He has played guitar with many other artists including [[Terry Hall (singer)|Terry Hall]], [[Roddy Frame]], [[Alison Moyet]], [[Denise Van Outen]], [[Edwyn Collins]] and [[Paul Quinn (singer)|Paul Quinn]] (He was also asked to join [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]]'s James Kirk and Steven Daly's band Memphis), [[Buzzcocks]]/[[Flag of Convenience (band)|FOC]], [[Robert Lloyd (Nightingales)|Robert Lloyd]], Deadly Avenger, Red Venom, Vinny Peculiar and The Family Foundation.

It is named after nearby [[Sabino Canyon]]. (Contemporary establishments [[Santa Rita High School]] and [[Sahuaro High School]] have similar facilities.) Starting with grades 9 and 10, it finally had a full graduating class in 1975. This class chose the school colors purple and gold, and chose Sabercats as the mascot. A committee of freshman at Sahuaro who were going to transfer as sophomores into Sabino came up with the choices put up to a vote of all of the incoming sophomores. The other option was maroon and silver, with the mascot of the Toros. In the early years of the school, a junior high (grades 7 and 8) was located on the same campus.\n\n== Sports ==\nAlthough Sabino is only 40 years old, it has a rich sports tradition, mainly in the sport of [[American football|football]]. Apart from football Sabino has also won team state championships in volleyball (1989) softball(1991) cheerleading (2004, 2010) golf (1986), [[baseball]] (1997), men's (1995, 2005) and women's soccer (1996, 2008), swimming and [[Diving (sport)|diving]], cross country (2007), and [[track and field]], and individual state titles in [[scholastic wrestling|wrestling]] and [[tennis]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Tennis state tournament: Sabino's Lee, Bonhoff win state doubles title|url=http://azstarnet.com/sports/tennis/high-school-and-prep/article_883c9409-9a6d-543d-af2b-dd211d221f80.html|accessdate=June 29, 2011|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star|date=May 10, 2011}}</ref>\n \n=== Early years ===\n\nSabino struggled through its first two decades. Coached by Don Holley in their first varsity seasons, the Sabercats struggled for wins, culminating with an 0\u201320 record in Coach Holley's last two seasons. Those struggles were soon forgotten with the arrival of Arizona high school coaching legend Ollie Mayfield, who had led perennial state championship contenders at Tucson High School. Mayfield instilled a sense of pride and commitment that spurred Sabino to its first playoff game in 1977 against cross town powerhouse Amphi. Mayfield was still quite popular at Tucson High, so end zone bleachers at Rincon High School were added to accommodate the overflow crowd. Sabino lost, but it was the beginning of a superpower football program in Arizona. In 1978, Mayfield led Sabino back to the playoffs where the Sabercats stunned No. 1 ranked Sunnyside 24-7. Sabino advanced to the state playoffs for the first time, but lost to Phoenix Washington 7-3. Mayfield continued with his successes in 1979, again moving the team into the playoffs with a first round win against Tucson's [[Salpointe Catholic High School]], eventually losing in the quarterfinals to the [[Mesa High School (Mesa, Arizona)|Mesa Jackrabbits]] in a hard fought game at [[Westwood High School (Mesa, Arizona)|Westwood High School]] in Mesa. Those teams generated several All-Star, All-City and All-State selections, thus creating the foundation for those who would follow. Mayfield had set Sabino well on the path of its winning ways with 3-year totals of 23 wins and 12 losses, the latter being primarily attributed to his first season.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2007}}\nThe arrival of coach [[Jeff Scurran]] marked the beginning of an era and set in motion the transformation of Sabino into a football powerhouse.

Many saw this investment as a sign that the school and community was ready to commit to winning.\n\nScurran took over a 2-win Sabino team and turned the Sabercats into a three-time state champion (1990, 1992 and 1998) and led the team to the final four or better in nine of his 12 seasons while posting a 127-26-1 record.<ref>Grammer, Geoff.

Holland stepped down after one season and the Sabercats were left without a coach. In 2001, Gary Buer was hired to take over and rebuild Sabino's program. After two seasons, Buer left the Sabercats to build a new college football program at a small, private liberal arts college in Virginia. With new head coach Jay Campos and a realignment back to the 4A Conference, Sabino brought the program back to elite level status. In 2005 they made it back to the state title game for the first time in 6 years but lost to Glendale's [[Cactus High School]].

It is said to be one of the most difficult styles to execute on stage, with young artists preparing for their roles for several years before they get a chance to do it on stage. The actors speak a \"[[sign language]]\", where the word part of the character's dialogue is expressed through \"hand signs (mudras)\", while emotions and mood is expressed through \"facial and eye\" movements.<ref name=\"claus2003p332\"/> In parallel, vocalists in the background sing rhythmically the play, matching the beats of the orchestra playing, thus unifying the ensemble into a resonant oneness.<ref name=\"claus2003p332\"/>\n\nSeveral ancient Sanskrit texts such as ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' and ''[[Hastha Lakshanadeepika]]'' discuss hand gestures or mudras. Kathakali follows the ''Hastha Lakshanadeepika'' most closely, unlike other classical dances of India.<ref name=\"claus2003p332\"/><ref name=zarrilli17/>\n\nThere are 24 main [[mudras]], and numerous more minor ones in Kathakali.<ref name=\"JonesRyan2006p230\"/>{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=73-79, 93}} There are nine facial expressions called ''[[Navarasas]]'', which each actor masters through facial muscle control during his education, in order to express the emotional state of the character in the play.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=73-79, 93}} The theory behind the ''Navarasas'' is provided by classical Sanskrit texts such as Natya Shastra, but sometimes with different names, and these are found in other classical Indian dances as well. The nine ''[[Navarasas]]'' express nine ''Bhava'' (emotions) in Kathakali as follows: ''Sringara'' expresses ''Rati'' (love, pleasure, delight), ''Hasya'' expresses ''Hasa'' (comic, laugh, mocking), ''Karuna'' expresses ''Shoka'' (pathetic, sad), ''Raudra'' expresses ''Krodha'' (anger, fury), ''Vira'' expresses ''Utsaha'' (vigor, enthusiasm, heroic), ''Bhayanaka'' expresses ''Bhaya'' (fear, concern, worry), ''Bibhatsa'' expresses ''Jugupsa'' (disgust, repulsive), ''Adbhuta'' expresses ''Vismaya'' (wondrous, marvel, curious) and ''Shanta'' expresses ''Sama'' (peace, tranquility).{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=134}}\n\n===Sequence===\nA Kathakal\u012b performance typically starts with artists tuning their instruments and warming up with beats, signalling to the arriving audience that the artists are getting ready and the preparations are on. The repertoire includes a series of performances. First comes the ''Totayam'' and ''Puruppatu'' performances, which are preliminary 'pure' (abstract) dances that emphasize skill and pure motion.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=62}} ''Totayam'' is performed behind a curtain and without all the costumes, while ''Puruppatu'' is performed without the curtain and in full costumes.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=62}}\n\nThe expressive part of the performance, which constitutes the dance-drama, is split into four types: ''Kalasam'' (major and most common), ''Iratti'' (special, used with battles-related ''Cempata'' rhythm),  ''Tonkaram'' (similar to ''Iratti'' but different music), and ''Nalamiratti'' (used for exits or link between the chapters of the play).{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=62}}\n\nThe entrance of characters onto the Kathakal\u012b stage can be varied. Many of these ways are not found in other major Indian classical dance traditions. Kathakal\u012b employs several methods: 1) direct without special effects or curtain; 2) through the audience, a method that engages the audience, led by torchbearers since Kathakal\u012b is typically a night performance; 3) tease and suspense called ''nokku'' or ''tirassila'' or ''tiranokku'', where the character is slowly revealed by the use of a curtain.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=166}} The \"tease\" method is typically used for characters with hidden, dangerous intentions.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=166}}\n\n==Songs and musical instruments==\n{{multiple image\n | footer = Three types of drums of Kathakali: ''Maddalam'' (left), ''Chenda'' and ''Idakka'' (right)\n | image1 = Maddalam.jpg | width1=170\n | image2 = Chenda 1.JPG | width2=150\n | image3 = \u0d07\u0d1f\u0d2f\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15.JPG | width3=85\n }}\nThe play is in the form of verses that are metered and lyrical, sung by vocalists whose voice has been trained to various melodies (''raga''), music and synchronized with the dance-acting on the stage.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=58-60}} The vocalists not only deliver the lines, but help set the context and express the inner state of the character by modulating their voice. For example, anger is expressed by the use of sharp high voice and pleading is expressed by the use of a tired tone.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=61}}\n\nMusic is central to a Kathakali performance. It sets the mood and triggers emotions resonant with the nature of the scene.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=61}} It also sets the rhythm to which the actor-dancers perform the choreography and scenes. Some major musical patterns, according to Clifford and Betty, that go with the moods and content of the scene are: ''Cempata'' (most common and default that applies to a range of moods, in battles and fights between good and evil, also to conclude a scene); ''Campa'' music (depict tension, dispute, disagreement between lovers or competing ideas); ''Pancari'' (for odious, preparatory such as sharpening a sword); ''Triputa'' (thought-provoking, scenes involving sages and teachers); ''Atlanta'' (scenes involving kings or divine beings); ''Muri Atlanta'' musical style (for comic, light-hearted, or fast-moving scenes involving heroic or anger-driven activity).{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=61}}\n\nMany musical instruments are used in Kathakali. Three major drums found are ''Maddalam''(barrel-shaped),''Centa''(cylindrical drum played with curved sticks) and ''Itaykka''  ( [[Idakka]] , hourglass-shaped drum with muted and melodious notes played when female characters perform).{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=58}}\n\n==Traditional plays==\n{{Further information|Aattakatha (performance)}}\nOver five hundred Kathakal\u012b plays (''[[Aattakatha (performance)|Aattakatha]]'') exist, most of which were written before the 20th century.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=59-60}} Of these, about four dozen are most actively performed.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=60}} These plays are sophisticated literary works, states Zarrilli, and only five authors have written more than two plays.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=60}} The late 17th century [[Unnayi Variyar]], in his short life, produced four plays which are traditionally considered the most expressive of the Kathakali [[playwright]]s. Typically, his four plays are performed on four nights, and they relate to the mythical Hindu love story of [[Nala]] and [[Damayanti]].{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=60}} The Nala-Damayanti story has roots in the texts of 1st millennium BCE and is found in the Mahabharata, but the Kathakali play version develops the characters, their inner states, the emotions and their circumstances far more than the older texts.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=60}}\n\nA tradition Kathakal\u012b play typically consists of two interconnected parts, the third-person ''Shlokas'' and first-person ''Padams''. The ''Shlokas'' are in Sanskrit and describe the action in the scene, while ''Padams'' are dialogues in Malayalam (Sanskritized) for the actors to interpret and play.<ref name=\"claus2003p332\"/> A ''Padam'' consists of three parts: a ''[[Pallavi]]'' (refrain), ''[[Anupallavi]]'' (subrefrain) and ''[[Charanam|Caranam]]'' (foot), all of which are set to one of the ancient ''[[Raga|Ragas]]'' ([[Mode (music)|musical mode]]), based on the mood and context as outlined in ancient Sanskrit texts such as the ''Natya Shastra''.<ref name=\"claus2003p332\"/>{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=41-44}} In historic practice of a play performance, each ''Padam'' was enacted twice by the actor while the vocalists sang the lines repeatedly as the actor-dancer played his role out.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=41-44}}\n\nThe traditional plays were long, many written to be performed all night, some such as those based on the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' written to be performed for many sequential nights. However, others such as the ''Prahlada Caritam'' have been composed so that they can be performed within four hours.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=61}} Modern productions have extracted parts of these legendary plays, to be typically performed within 3 to 4 hours.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=61-62}}\n\n===Offshoots and modern adaptations===\nKathakal\u012b is still practiced in its Traditional  ways and there are experimental plays based on European classics and Shakespeare's plays. Recent productions have adapted stories from other cultures and mythologies, such as those of Miguel de Cervantes,<ref>http://www.elnortedecastilla.es/culturas/201607/25/quijote-medio-camino-entre-20160721111257.html</ref> Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and [[William Shakespeare]].<ref name=daugherty52/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Farley P.

These developed in part because of the [[Gurukula|Gurukul]] system of its transmission from one generation to the next.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=26-27}} By the 19th-century, many such styles were in vogue in Malayalam speaking communities of South India, of which two major styles have crystallized and survived into the modern age.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=26-27}}{{Sfn|D. Appukuttan Nair, Ayyappa K. Paniker|1993|pp=35-38}}\n\nThe ''Kidangoor'' style is one of the two, that developed in [[Travancore]], and it is strongly influenced by ''Kutiyattam'', while also drawing elements of ''Ramanattam'' and ''Kalladikkotan''.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=26}} It is traditionally attributed to Nalanunni, under the patronage of Utram Tirunal Maharaja (1815-1861).{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=26}}\n\nThe ''Kalluvazhi'' style is second of the two, which developed in [[Palakkad]] ([[Olappamanna Mana]]) in central Kerala,<ref name=\"The Treasure Chest of Cultural Patronage\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.webindia123.com/user_interaction/asp/article/article.asp?a_no=2267&article=Olappamanna+Mana+%7C+The+Treasure+Chest+of+Cultural+Patronage%21+ |title=The Treasure Chest of Cultural Patronage |website=https://www.webindia123.com |language=en |access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref> and it is a synthesis of the older ''Kaplingadan'' and ''Kalladikkotan'' performance arts.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=26-27}}{{Sfn|D.

Modern performances are shorter. The stage with seating typically in open grounds outside a temple, but in some places, special theatres called ''Kuttampalam'' built inside the temple compounds have been in use.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=49-50}}\n\nThe stage is mostly bare, or with a few drama-related items.<ref name=\"ClausDiamond2003p331\"/> One item, called a Kalivilakku (kali meaning dance; ''vilakku'' meaning lamp), can be traced back to Kutiyattam. In both traditions, the performance happens in the front of a huge Kalivilakku with its thick wick sunk in coconut oil, burning with a yellow light.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=49-50}} Traditionally, before the advent of electricity, this special large lamp provided light during the night. As the play progressed, the actor-dancers would gather around this lamp so that the audience could see what they are expressing.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=49-50}}\n\nThe performance involves actor-dancers in the front, supported by musicians in the background stage on right (audience's left) and with vocalists in the front of the stage (historically so they could be heard by the audience before the age of microphone and speakers).<ref name=\"ClausDiamond2003p331\"/>{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=49-50}}{{Refn|group=note|Modern performances with microphone and speakers sometimes position the vocalists in the back.}} Typically, all roles are played by male actor-dancers, though in modern performances, women have been welcomed into the Kathakali tradition.<ref name=\"Kramarae2004p295\"/><ref name=\"ClausDiamond2003p331\"/>\n\n===Costumes===\nOf all classical Indian dances, Kathakali has the most elaborate costuming consisting of head dresses, face masks and vividly painted faces.<ref name=\"JonesRyan2006p230\"/>{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=53-56}}<ref>{{cite book|author1=Janelle G.

Some characters have a green face (representing heroic or excellence as a warrior) with red dots or lines on their cheeks or red-coloured moustache or red-streaked beard (representing evil inner nature), while others have a full face and beard coloured red, the latter implying excessively evil characters.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=54}} Kari (black) is the code for forest dwellers, hunters, and middle ground character.{{Sfn| Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=55}} Demonesses and treacherous characters are also painted black but with streaks or patches of red.{{Sfn| Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=55}}\n\nYellow is the code for monks, mendicants, and women. ''Minukka'' (radiant, shining) with a warm yellow, orange or saffron typifies noble, virtuous feminine characters such as [[Sita]], Panchali and Mohini.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=55}} Men who act the roles of women also add a false top knot to their left and decorate it in a style common to the region.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=55}} Vella Thadi (white beard) represents a divine being, someone with virtuous inner state and consciousness such as [[Hanuman]].{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=54}} ''Teppu'' is for special characters found in Hindu mythologies, such as [[Garuda]], Jatayu and [[Hamsa (bird)|Hamsa]] who act as messengers or carriers, but do not fit the other categories.{{Sfn| Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=55}} Face masks and headgear is added to accentuate the inner nature of the characters. The garments colours have a similar community accepted code of silent communication.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=54-55}}\n\nThe character types, states Zarrilli, reflect the [[Gu\u1e47a]] theory of personalities in the ancient [[Samkhya]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]].{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=55-57}} There are three Gu\u1e47as, according to this philosophy, that have always been and continue to be present in all things and beings in the world.<ref name=jamesg>James G.

It is said to be one of the most difficult styles to execute on stage, with young artists preparing for their roles for several years before they get a chance to do it on stage. The actors speak a \"[[sign language]]\", where the word part of the character's dialogue is expressed through \"hand signs (mudras)\", while emotions and mood is expressed through \"facial and eye\" movements.<ref name=\"claus2003p332\"/> In parallel, vocalists in the background sing rhythmically the play, matching the beats of the orchestra playing, thus unifying the ensemble into a resonant oneness.<ref name=\"claus2003p332\"/>\n\nSeveral ancient Sanskrit texts such as ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' and ''[[Hastha Lakshanadeepika]]'' discuss hand gestures or mudras. Kathakali follows the ''Hastha Lakshanadeepika'' most closely, unlike other classical dances of India.<ref name=\"claus2003p332\"/><ref name=zarrilli17/>\n\nThere are 24 main [[mudras]], and numerous more minor ones in Kathakali.<ref name=\"JonesRyan2006p230\"/>{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=73-79, 93}} There are nine facial expressions called ''[[Navarasas]]'', which each actor masters through facial muscle control during his education, in order to express the emotional state of the character in the play.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=73-79, 93}} The theory behind the ''Navarasas'' is provided by classical Sanskrit texts such as Natya Shastra, but sometimes with different names, and these are found in other classical Indian dances as well. The nine ''[[Navarasas]]'' express nine ''Bhava'' (emotions) in Kathakali as follows: ''Sringara'' expresses ''Rati'' (love, pleasure, delight), ''Hasya'' expresses ''Hasa'' (comic, laugh, mocking), ''Karuna'' expresses ''Shoka'' (pathetic, sad), ''Raudra'' expresses ''Krodha'' (anger, fury), ''Vira'' expresses ''Utsaha'' (vigor, enthusiasm, heroic), ''Bhayanaka'' expresses ''Bhaya'' (fear, concern, worry), ''Bibhatsa'' expresses ''Jugupsa'' (disgust, repulsive), ''Adbhuta'' expresses ''Vismaya'' (wondrous, marvel, curious) and ''Shanta'' expresses ''Sama'' (peace, tranquility).{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=134}}\n\n===Sequence===\nA Kathakal\u012b performance typically starts with artists tuning their instruments and warming up with beats, signalling to the arriving audience that the artists are getting ready and the preparations are on. The repertoire includes a series of performances. First comes the ''Totayam'' and ''Puruppatu'' performances, which are preliminary 'pure' (abstract) dances that emphasize skill and pure motion.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=62}} ''Totayam'' is performed behind a curtain and without all the costumes, while ''Puruppatu'' is performed without the curtain and in full costumes.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=62}}\n\nThe expressive part of the performance, which constitutes the dance-drama, is split into four types: ''Kalasam'' (major and most common), ''Iratti'' (special, used with battles-related ''Cempata'' rhythm),  ''Tonkaram'' (similar to ''Iratti'' but different music), and ''Nalamiratti'' (used for exits or link between the chapters of the play).{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=62}}\n\nThe entrance of characters onto the Kathakal\u012b stage can be varied. Many of these ways are not found in other major Indian classical dance traditions. Kathakal\u012b employs several methods: 1) direct without special effects or curtain; 2) through the audience, a method that engages the audience, led by torchbearers since Kathakal\u012b is typically a night performance; 3) tease and suspense called ''nokku'' or ''tirassila'' or ''tiranokku'', where the character is slowly revealed by the use of a curtain.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=166}} The \"tease\" method is typically used for characters with hidden, dangerous intentions.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=166}}\n\n==Songs and musical instruments==\n{{multiple image\n | footer = Three types of drums of Kathakali: ''Maddalam'' (left), ''Chenda'' and ''Idakka'' (right)\n | image1 = Maddalam.jpg | width1=170\n | image2 = Chenda 1.JPG | width2=150\n | image3 = \u0d07\u0d1f\u0d2f\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15.JPG | width3=85\n }}\nThe play is in the form of verses that are metered and lyrical, sung by vocalists whose voice has been trained to various melodies (''raga''), music and synchronized with the dance-acting on the stage.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=58-60}} The vocalists not only deliver the lines, but help set the context and express the inner state of the character by modulating their voice. For example, anger is expressed by the use of sharp high voice and pleading is expressed by the use of a tired tone.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=61}}\n\nMusic is central to a Kathakali performance. It sets the mood and triggers emotions resonant with the nature of the scene.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=61}} It also sets the rhythm to which the actor-dancers perform the choreography and scenes. Some major musical patterns, according to Clifford and Betty, that go with the moods and content of the scene are: ''Cempata'' (most common and default that applies to a range of moods, in battles and fights between good and evil, also to conclude a scene); ''Campa'' music (depict tension, dispute, disagreement between lovers or competing ideas); ''Pancari'' (for odious, preparatory such as sharpening a sword); ''Triputa'' (thought-provoking, scenes involving sages and teachers); ''Atlanta'' (scenes involving kings or divine beings); ''Muri Atlanta'' musical style (for comic, light-hearted, or fast-moving scenes involving heroic or anger-driven activity).{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=61}}\n\nMany musical instruments are used in Kathakali. Three major drums found are ''Maddalam''(barrel-shaped),''Centa''(cylindrical drum played with curved sticks) and ''Itaykka''  ( [[Idakka]] , hourglass-shaped drum with muted and melodious notes played when female characters perform).{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|p=58}}\n\n==Traditional plays==\n{{Further information|Aattakatha (performance)}}\nOver five hundred Kathakal\u012b plays (''[[Aattakatha (performance)|Aattakatha]]'') exist, most of which were written before the 20th century.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=59-60}} Of these, about four dozen are most actively performed.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=60}} These plays are sophisticated literary works, states Zarrilli, and only five authors have written more than two plays.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=60}} The late 17th century [[Unnayi Variyar]], in his short life, produced four plays which are traditionally considered the most expressive of the Kathakali [[playwright]]s. Typically, his four plays are performed on four nights, and they relate to the mythical Hindu love story of [[Nala]] and [[Damayanti]].{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=60}} The Nala-Damayanti story has roots in the texts of 1st millennium BCE and is found in the Mahabharata, but the Kathakali play version develops the characters, their inner states, the emotions and their circumstances far more than the older texts.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=60}}\n\nA tradition Kathakal\u012b play typically consists of two interconnected parts, the third-person ''Shlokas'' and first-person ''Padams''. The ''Shlokas'' are in Sanskrit and describe the action in the scene, while ''Padams'' are dialogues in Malayalam (Sanskritized) for the actors to interpret and play.<ref name=\"claus2003p332\"/> A ''Padam'' consists of three parts: a ''[[Pallavi]]'' (refrain), ''[[Anupallavi]]'' (subrefrain) and ''[[Charanam|Caranam]]'' (foot), all of which are set to one of the ancient ''[[Raga|Ragas]]'' ([[Mode (music)|musical mode]]), based on the mood and context as outlined in ancient Sanskrit texts such as the ''Natya Shastra''.<ref name=\"claus2003p332\"/>{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=41-44}} In historic practice of a play performance, each ''Padam'' was enacted twice by the actor while the vocalists sang the lines repeatedly as the actor-dancer played his role out.{{Sfn|Phillip Zarrilli|2000|pp=41-44}}\n\nThe traditional plays were long, many written to be performed all night, some such as those based on the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' written to be performed for many sequential nights. However, others such as the ''Prahlada Caritam'' have been composed so that they can be performed within four hours.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|p=61}} Modern productions have extracted parts of these legendary plays, to be typically performed within 3 to 4 hours.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=61-62}}\n\n===Offshoots and modern adaptations===\nKathakal\u012b is still practiced in its Traditional [[Hindu]] ways and there are experimental plays based on European classics and Shakespeare's plays. Recent productions have adapted stories from other cultures and mythologies, such as those of Miguel de Cervantes,<ref>http://www.elnortedecastilla.es/culturas/201607/25/quijote-medio-camino-entre-20160721111257.html</ref> Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and [[William Shakespeare]].<ref name=daugherty52/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Farley P.

These developed in part because of the [[Gurukula|Gurukul]] system of its transmission from one generation to the next.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=26-27}} By the 19th-century, many such styles were in vogue in Malayalam speaking communities of South India, of which two major styles have crystallized and survived into the modern age.{{Sfn|Philip Zarrilli|1984|pp=26-27}}{{Sfn|D.

Reeves adds, \"Whereas the threatening sounds Dre created for N.W.A were shunned by radio and television, the smoothed-out production on ''The Chronic'', sounding more like R&B than hip hop, made hardcore attractive to these outlets.
