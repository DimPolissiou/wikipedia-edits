During this period she designed fabrics and wallpaper that were sold though stores in Philadelphia and New York. In a [[United Press International]] article published in June 1958 Sherman provided a glimpse into her textile and interior architectural design philosophy: \"Designers must have a real sense about people and machines or they'll produce designs which are cultural lags.  We must understand the American Women especially, and realize that she is in a state of transition.\" <ref>{{cite book|last1 = | first1 = |last2 = | first2 = |title = Women Rate as Headache for Designers|publisher = [[United Press International]]|location = Anderson Herald, Anderson Indiana|date = June 26, 1958|doi = |isbn = }}</ref>\n\nDuring WWII, Sherman lived in [[Eagle Pass, Texas]] where her husband was stationed with the 45th Massachusetts Regiment.\n\n===Italy, 1952-1954===\n[[File:Sarai Sherman, Canto Mezzogiorno (1953).jpg|thumb|painting by Sarai Sherman]]\nSherman was awarded a [[Fulbright]] Grant to paint in [[Italy]].  There she gained a deep perspective into the poverty of postwar [[Europe]]. The experiences touched Sherman and became a turning point in her artistic development. For her, Italy became a platform from where she could look and participate in culture completely. She wrote from Matera in the Spring of 1953 \"I feel at home...not because these caves remind me of Philadelphia, but because somehow a passage of light or color, or the motion of an animal, recall to my mind moments of my childhood, distant places.  I feel as if it were my former self contemplating this forbidding white region. I see a women with her child in her arms: His small body is in continuous motion, he looks around, he screams. I see mother and child in the sunlight, and it seems to me that I saw them years before, exhausted, yet beautiful.  The old image is superimposed in the new one. The painting process is automatic, spontaneous, it leads me.  The finished product is all chrome yellow, with ochre hues hovering between white and ivory. They reveal a sense of the ancient.\"<ref name=Roma>Venturoli, Marcello, Satai Sherman, Edition Penelope, Roma 1963</ref>\n\nSherman's conceptual ideas that were expressed in her painting were comparisons between reality and reminiscences, a compelling concern with the world of others, with the dejected southern Italian population and an identification of her own origin within that dejection and that poverty. During these years her art proceeded autobiographically, in the sense that, following an irrepressible necessity she identified with the subjects of her paintings.  This period is full of symbolic content, the tenderness, the thoughtfulness of her paintings, which often become the moment of completion of an experience instead of simply leading to the discovery of new worlds of characters.<ref name=Roma/>\n\nThe exceptional episodic importance which was at the base of works done before 1955 becomes evident in the late 1950s.  What used to be the figurative concentration of a tragedy becomes a portrayal of persons and things perceived in the midst of reality ''in fieri'' until the fleeting moment sets in.<ref name=Roma/>\n\n=== 1955-1960===\n[[File:Sarai Sherman, Baby Doll (1957).jpg|thumb|Baby Doll, 1957]]\nFrom 1955 to 1960 Sherman worked in the United States. During this period, she amplified the typology and the background of her experiences, weighting the density of her painting. She retracted her steps from [[Picasso]] to the Impressionists. Like [[Francis Bacon]], who after his surrealist Phicassian phase reverted to color painting, Sherman transferred onto her canvas a number of principles of the French masters of the late nineteenth century, filtered through schemes, vision and images, which were neither nineteenth century nor post-romantic in character, largely because internal plastic contraditions of the work and because of her awareness of the dimension of time. The ever-changing spectacle offered by the streets, are elements which have entered her fantasy by force, obliging her to move in a humble effort towards an increased objectivity, but which in the same act of reduction emerge more autobiographical then ever.<ref name=Roma/>\n\nSherman was a part of the emergency response to the [[1966 flood of the Arno]] in Florence Italy. A group of international women artists called the \u201c[[Flood Ladies]]\u201d donated work to the city as a sign of solidarity following the Arno's catastrophic damage. The work donated to the city is now housed in the \"Museum of the 1900s.\" As part of the 50th anniversary of the flooding, Sherman's work titled ''Icarus'' was one of 28 in a representative traveling exhibition and featured in the Book \u201cWhen the World Answered\u201d and the 2015 PBS documentary of the same name.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = | first1 = |last2 = | first2 = |title = Eight of the Flood Ladies|publisher = Advancing Women Artists Foundation|location = Florence, Italy|date = 2015|doi = |isbn = }}</ref>\n\nSherman was represented by the ACA Galleries in New York throughout the 1950s and then by the Forum Gallery. Sherman has had numerous significant solo exhibitions throughout the United States and in Europe including the ACA Gallery, New York City (1951, 1955, 1958, 1960); Galleria La Nuova Pesa, Rome (1961), and Galleria Viotti, Turin (1963) \u2013 both in Italy; Forum Gallery, New York City (1963, 1967, 1970, 1974, 1986); Fairweather-Hardin Gallery, Chicago Illinois (1964); Museum of Contemporary Art, Skopje, Yugoslavia (1965); Galerie Weltz, Salzburg, Austria and Salon Tribune Mladih, Novi Sad, Yugoslavia (1966); Galleria dell\u2019Orso, Milan (1973), and Studio 5, Bologna (1976) \u2013 both in Italy; Madison Gallery, Toronto Canada (1976); Galleria Giulia, Rome, Italy (1982).<ref>{{cite book|last = Barletta|first = Riccardo|title = Sarai Sherman|publisher = [[32 Galleria d'Arte]]|location = Milano, Italy|year = 1973|doi =|isbn = }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sarai Sherman, Bear Cat (1957).jpg|thumb|Bear Cat, 1957]]\nSherman created numerous lithographs and prints. Many of these editioned works were produced at the renowned atelier Il Bisonte in Florence who also produced significant works for [[Henry Moore]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].\n\nSherman won numerous awards and prizes for her work including a Pepsi Cola award (1945), [[Fulbright Foundation]] fellowship to Italy (1952-1954), a painting award from the [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]], New York City (1964) and their Childe Hassam Prize (1970); in addition to many medals, citations and prizes in exhibitions throughout Italy and the [[Proctor Prize]], [[National Academy of Design]], New York City (1976).\n\n==Style and influences==\n\nSherman's major, and critically acclaimed, work produced in Italy during the mid 1950 was focused on the sun drenched settings, people and post World War II milieu of [[Southern Italy]]. The tonal and ethereal quality of her paintings from this period capture the arid colors and blinding light of the [[Mezzogiorno]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Hamburg|first = Galerie Welz|title = Sarai Sherman|publisher = Salzburg Marz|location = |year = 1966|doi = |isbn = }}</ref>\n\nMario Penelope recalled in his 1983 essay on Sherman titled Coherence And Reality: \"a group of paintings done during that first stay which were exhibited in nineteen hundred and fifty five in her first Roman one-person show at the Zodiac Gallery. In these canvases there were images of women, children, and sharecroppers; portrayed austerely in their most typical attitudes in a strange archaic manner. They seemed encamped with weighted solemmity in a timeless spatiality; in an understated drama of transcendent sadness which laid bare with bitter emotion the dark pathetic solitude of that sharecropper world. Shapes and forms were conceived within a rigorous formal scheme. These shapes were layered into a rhythm of concrete volumes in which at intervals the profound sense of the value of color soberly restrained filtered through.  Forms were emphasized by a concise pre-meditated linear drawing in which there were residual suggestions of the lesson of Picasso and [[Cubism]]\".<ref name=Ragghianti/>   \n \nThe Italian art critic [[Duilio Morosini]] framed Sherman in an artistic and cultural context in her 1977 essay for the book Sarai Sherman. Morosini wrote that one needs now to place \u201cSherman in a historical relationship to other exponents of American critical realism, both of the first and second generation.  The major recurring theme of an isolated urban solitude (expressed by an standardization of choices, in personal ideals and practical solutions, and hence the disappearance of feeling and communication) is not  seen by this artist as a grievous meditation of the state of things where nothing can be achieved, as one sees in [[Edward Hopper]]\u2019s revealing objectivism; nor is it an irascible accusation as in the post war II revival of [[expressionism]]. In her painting (not only the earlier period from 1954 to 1965, but in all her developments) the characters do not rely upon indicative details, rather upon the \u201cwhole\u201d with its resolute \u201caura\u201d (inherent in such pictorialization of the thought imagery). The projection of light in the painting in which every presence, every act seems to be caught in an equivocal transition between day and night or vice versa; in other words, in the inquietude and expectation of an unpredictable change.\u201d <ref name=Duilio>{{cite book|last1 = Sherman | first1 = Sarai|last2 = Morosini|first2 = Duilio|title = Sarai Sherman Opere 1971-77|publisher = [[Edizioni Trentadue]]|location = Italy|year = 1977|doi = |isbn = }}</ref>\n\n\u201cIn Sherman\u2019s work there is a consistent involvement with a visualization of distorted values in the continuum of social generalization.  During 1962 she completed a series of large composition paintings that focused on the death of the matrix of post World War II sex symbols. The capacity of Sherman to use the ambivalence inherent in metaphorical values, as a springboard in the employ of tonal color, immersed in diffused light has also made it possible to retain a sensitivity towards a younger generation\u2019s milieu.  Her work in the 1970s reflected a shift in the pictorialization of generalized meanings; a constantly precarious situation for all painters of Sherman\u2019s generations.\u201d<ref name=Duilio/>\n\nOverarching themes in Sherman's work focused on concerns with humankind's inhumanity to one another, where form and content are one.\n\n===Ceramics===\nSherman began exploring three-dimensional form in ceramic sculpture in the early 1980s.  The contemplative work from this period presents serne animal and human forms to the viewers gaze. The organic sensual shapes evoke or are explicitly feminine in form. The tactile and often delicate porcelain work were metaphorical juxtapositions of fundamental dualities: peace and war, life and death.<ref>{{cite book|title = Sarai Sherman: Ceramic Sculpture|publisher = Madison Gallery|location = Toronto|year = 1986|doi =|isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===[[Guzzetti Chapel]] (Cappella Guzzetti), Camera Picta, Cortona Italia===\nBetween 1987 and 1994 Sherman created major site-specific fresco and [[altarpiece]] commission in [[Cortona]], Italy for the [[Guzzetti Chapel]] on the grounds of the Villa Corono. The [[fresco]] cycle called Camera Picta are painted on the walls of the 18th century building owned by the Italian art patrons the Guzzettis. The allegorical work focus on the biblical and secular themes including sheep, bucolic landscape and flora.<ref>{{cite book|last = Sarai|first = Sherman|title = Camera Picta|publisher = [[University of Washington Press]]|location = Italy|year = 1994|doi=|isbn = }}</ref>  The paintings are saturated in muted tones and soft umber, ochre and cream colors that recall her work of the 1950s.  The full commission included paintings, sculpture and architectural [[trompe l\u2019oeil]]. The altar-piece, (1992-1994) utilizes three-dimensional ceramic forms, a rendering of sheep in repetition as biblical symbolism.\n\n==Legacy==\nSherman's work is included in numerous private and public permanent collections including the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) New York; the [[Whitney Museum of Art]], New York;<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Goodrich | first1 = Lloyd|last2 = Bryant | first2 = Edward|title = Forty Artists Under Forty From the Collection of The Whitney Museum of American Art|publisher = [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]|location = New York|year = 1962|doi = |isbn = }}</ref> [[Syracuse University]]; [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], Washington, DC; the [[National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome]]; the [[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence, Italy; Sconci Art Gallery, Dubai; Jerusalem Museum, Israel; National Gallery of Modern Art, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia; International Museum of Modern Art, Skopje, Yugoslavia; Gramsci Museum, Ghilarza, Sardinia.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Heller | first1 = Jules|last2 = Heller | first2 = Nancy G.|title = North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary|publisher = Il Bisonte|location = Firenze, Italy|year = 1964|doi = |isbn = }}</ref>\n\nSherman died in New York City on October 24, 2013.\n\n==Awards==\n\n* 1949 Pepsi Cola Award, USA\n* 1952 [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Grant]] in Painting, Italy \n* 1964 Award for Painting, [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]], New York, USA \n* 1964 Premio Cecina, Italy \n* 1965 Premio Resistenza, Pistoia\n* 1965 Premio San Giovanni (Gold medal from the President of the Senate)\n* 1967 Premio Marzotto (Special Citation) \n* 1969 Premio Acireale (Silver Medal)\n* 1970 Childe Hassan Purchase Prize, [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]], New York, USA\n* 1975 Premio San Marino, [[Republic of San Marino]] \n* 1976 [[Proctor Prize]], National Academy of Design, New York.\n\n==Selected group exhibitions==\n\n* 1949 Whitney Museum of Art, New York, Annual Exhibitions of Contemporary American Painting\n* 1950 Whitney Museum of Art, New York, Annual Exhibitions of Contemporary American Painting\n* 1952 Art Institute of Chicago, Contemporary Drawings From 12 Countries 1946 -1952\n* 1953 Brooklyn Museum, New York, 17th Biennial.\n* 1955 Whitney Museum of Art, New York, Annual Exhibitions of Contemporary American Painting  \n* 1958 Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC, Fulbright Painters\n* 1959 Whitney Museum of Art, Annual Exhibitions of Contemporary American Painting\n* 1960 Museum of Modern Art, New York, New Acquisitions\n* 1962 Whitney Museum of Art, New York, Forty Artists Under Forty\n* 1963 Whitney Museum of Art, New York, Annual Exhibitions of Contemporary American Painting  \n* 1971 Whitney Museum of Art, New York, Biennial of Painting\n* 1971 Women in the Whitney, Museum of American Art, New York\n* 1971 Contemporary Italian Graphics, Museum of Modern Art, Haifa and Ein Harod Neghev, Israel\n* 1972 Grafica di Oggi, International Biennal of Venice\n* 1974 Rassegna Internazionale d'Arte Presente, Rebubblica Amalfitana\n* 1974 International Portraiture, Albissola \n* 1975 Museum of Modern Art, New York, A Museum Menagerie\n* 1975 Arte Fano\n* 1975 Contemporary Graphics, Language and Generations in Confrontation, Vicenza\n* 1976 National Academy of Design Painting Annual, New York\n* 1976 Museum Menagerie, Museum of Modern Art, New York\n* 1977 International Biennnal of Premio Fiorino, Strozzi Palace, Florence\n* 2016 MAGI900 Museo d'arte, Women at Work, Bologna, Italy\n\n==Selected solo exhibitions 1950-1965==\n\n* 1951 ACA Gallery, New York, New York \n* 1955 ACA Gallery, New York, New York \n* 1955 Galleria dello Zodizco, Rome, Italy \n* 1958 ACA Gallery, New York, New York \n* 1960 ACA Gallery, New York, New York \n* 1961 Galleria delle Ore, Milan, Italy \n* 1961 Galleria La Nuova Pesa, Rome, Italy \n* 1963 Galleria La Polena, Genoa, Italy\n* 1963 Galleria delle Ore, Milan, Italy \n* 1963 Galleria Viotti, Turin, Italy \n* 1963 Forum Gallery, New York, New York  \n* 1963 Gallery Penelope, Rome, Italy \n* 1963 Galleria L'Incontro, Salerno, Italy \n* 1964 Galleria Lerici, Carrara, Italy \n* 1964 Fairweather-Hardin Gallery, Chicago Illinois\n* 1964 Galleria Il Sedile, Lecce, Italy\n* 1964 Galleria Il Portico, Reggio Emilia\n* 1964 Gallery Penelope, Rome, Italy \n* 1964 Galleria L'Incontro, Taranto, Italy \n* 1965 Galleria Trentadue, Milan, Italy \n* 1965 Museum of Contemporary Art, Skopje.\n\n==Published portfolios==\n* 1964 The Bachae, Ed.

We must understand the American Women especially, and realize that she is in a state of transition.\" <ref>{{cite book|last1 = | first1 = |last2 = | first2 = |title = Women Rate as Headache for Designers|publisher = [[United Press International]]|location = Anderson Herald, Anderson Indiana|date = June 26, 1958|doi = |isbn = }}</ref>\n\nDuring WWII, Sherman lived in [[Eagle Pass, Texas]] where her husband was stationed with the 45th Massachusetts Regiment.\n\n===Italy, 1952-1954===\n[[File:Sarai Sherman, Canto Mezzogiorno (1953).jpg|thumb|painting by Sarai Sherman]]\nSherman was awarded a [[Fulbright]] Grant to paint in [[Italy]].  There she gained a deep perspective into the poverty of postwar [[Europe]]. The experiences touched Sherman and became a turning point in her artistic development. For her, Italy became a platform from where she could look and participate in culture completely. She wrote from Matera in the Spring of 1953 \"I feel at home...not because these caves remind me of Philadelphia, but because somehow a passage of light or color, or the motion of an animal, recall to my mind moments of my childhood, distant places.  I feel as if it were my former self contemplating this forbidding white region. I see a women with her child in her arms: His small body is in continuous motion, he looks around, he screams. I see mother and child in the sunlight, and it seems to me that I saw them years before, exhausted, yet beautiful.  The old image is superimposed in the new one. The painting process is automatic, spontaneous, it leads me.  The finished product is all chrome yellow, with ochre hues hovering between white and ivory. They reveal a sense of the ancient.\"<ref name=Roma>Venturoli, Marcello, Satai Sherman, Edition Penelope, Roma 1963</ref>\n\nSherman's conceptual ideas that were expressed in her painting were comparisons between reality and reminiscences, a compelling concern with the world of others, with the dejected southern Italian population and an identification of her own origin within that dejection and that poverty. During these years her art proceeded autobiographically, in the sense that, following an irrepressible necessity she identified with the subjects of her paintings.  This period is full of symbolic content, the tenderness, the thoughtfulness of her paintings, which often become the moment of completion of an experience instead of simply leading to the discovery of new worlds of characters.<ref name=Roma/>\n\nThe exceptional episodic importance which was at the base of works done before 1955 becomes evident in the late 1950s.  What used to be the figurative concentration of a tragedy becomes a portrayal of persons and things perceived in the midst of reality ''in fieri'' until the fleeting moment sets in.<ref name=Roma/>\n\n=== 1955-1960===\n[[File:Sarai Sherman, Baby Doll (1957).jpg|thumb|Baby Doll, 1957]]\nFrom 1955 to 1960 Sherman worked in the United States. During this period, she amplified the typology and the background of her experiences, weighting the density of her painting. She retracted her steps from [[Picasso]] to the Impressionists. Like [[Francis Bacon]], who after his surrealist Phicassian phase reverted to color painting, Sherman transferred onto her canvas a number of principles of the French masters of the late nineteenth century, filtered through schemes, vision and images, which were neither nineteenth century nor post-romantic in character, largely because internal plastic contraditions of the work and because of her awareness of the dimension of time. The ever-changing spectacle offered by the streets, are elements which have entered her fantasy by force, obliging her to move in a humble effort towards an increased objectivity, but which in the same act of reduction emerge more autobiographical then ever.<ref name=Roma/>\n\nSherman was a part of the emergency response to the [[1966 flood of the Arno]] in Florence Italy. A group of international women artists called the \u201c[[Flood Ladies]]\u201d donated work to the city as a sign of solidarity following the Arno's catastrophic damage. The work donated to the city is now housed in the \"Museum of the 1900s.\" As part of the 50th anniversary of the flooding, Sherman's work titled ''Icarus'' was one of 28 in a representative traveling exhibition and featured in the Book \u201cWhen the World Answered\u201d and the 2015 PBS documentary of the same name.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = | first1 = |last2 = | first2 = |title = Eight of the Flood Ladies|publisher = Advancing Women Artists Foundation|location = Florence, Italy|date = 2015|doi = |isbn = }}</ref>\n\nSherman was represented by the ACA Galleries in New York throughout the 1950s and then by the Forum Gallery. Sherman has had numerous significant solo exhibitions throughout the United States and in Europe including the ACA Gallery, New York City (1951, 1955, 1958, 1960); Galleria La Nuova Pesa, Rome (1961), and Galleria Viotti, Turin (1963) \u2013 both in Italy; Forum Gallery, New York City (1963, 1967, 1970, 1974, 1986); Fairweather-Hardin Gallery, Chicago Illinois (1964); Museum of Contemporary Art, Skopje, Yugoslavia (1965); Galerie Weltz, Salzburg, Austria and Salon Tribune Mladih, Novi Sad, Yugoslavia (1966); Galleria dell\u2019Orso, Milan (1973), and Studio 5, Bologna (1976) \u2013 both in Italy; Madison Gallery, Toronto Canada (1976); Galleria Giulia, Rome, Italy (1982).<ref>{{cite book|last = Barletta|first = Riccardo|title = Sarai Sherman|publisher = [[32 Galleria d'Arte]]|location = Milano, Italy|year = 1973|doi =|isbn = }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sarai Sherman, Bear Cat (1957).jpg|thumb|Bear Cat, 1957]]\nSherman created numerous lithographs and prints. Many of these editioned works were produced at the renowned atelier Il Bisonte in Florence who also produced significant works for [[Henry Moore]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].\n\nSherman won numerous awards and prizes for her work including a Pepsi Cola award (1945), [[Fulbright Foundation]] fellowship to Italy (1952-1954), a painting award from the [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]], New York City (1964) and their Childe Hassam Prize (1970); in addition to many medals, citations and prizes in exhibitions throughout Italy and the [[Proctor Prize]], [[National Academy of Design]], New York City (1976).\n\n==Style and influences==\n\nSherman's major, and critically acclaimed, work produced in Italy during the mid 1950 was focused on the sun drenched settings, people and post World War II milieu of [[Southern Italy]]. The tonal and ethereal quality of her paintings from this period capture the arid colors and blinding light of the [[Mezzogiorno]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Hamburg|first = Galerie Welz|title = Sarai Sherman|publisher = Salzburg Marz|location = |year = 1966|doi = |isbn = }}</ref>\n\nMario Penelope recalled in his 1983 essay on Sherman titled Coherence And Reality: \"a group of paintings done during that first stay which were exhibited in nineteen hundred and fifty five in her first Roman one-person show at the Zodiac Gallery. In these canvases there were images of women, children, and sharecroppers; portrayed austerely in their most typical attitudes in a strange archaic manner. They seemed encamped with weighted solemmity in a timeless spatiality; in an understated drama of transcendent sadness which laid bare with bitter emotion the dark pathetic solitude of that sharecropper world. Shapes and forms were conceived within a rigorous formal scheme. These shapes were layered into a rhythm of concrete volumes in which at intervals the profound sense of the value of color soberly restrained filtered through.  Forms were emphasized by a concise pre-meditated linear drawing in which there were residual suggestions of the lesson of Picasso and [[Cubism]]\".<ref name=Ragghianti/>   \n \nThe Italian art critic [[Duilio Morosini]] framed Sherman in an artistic and cultural context in her 1977 essay for the book Sarai Sherman. Morosini wrote that one needs now to place \u201cSherman in a historical relationship to other exponents of American critical realism, both of the first and second generation.  The major recurring theme of an isolated urban solitude (expressed by an standardization of choices, in personal ideals and practical solutions, and hence the disappearance of feeling and communication) is not  seen by this artist as a grievous meditation of the state of things where nothing can be achieved, as one sees in [[Edward Hopper]]\u2019s revealing objectivism; nor is it an irascible accusation as in the post war II revival of [[expressionism]]. In her painting (not only the earlier period from 1954 to 1965, but in all her developments) the characters do not rely upon indicative details, rather upon the \u201cwhole\u201d with its resolute \u201caura\u201d (inherent in such pictorialization of the thought imagery). The projection of light in the painting in which every presence, every act seems to be caught in an equivocal transition between day and night or vice versa; in other words, in the inquietude and expectation of an unpredictable change.\u201d <ref name=Duilio>{{cite book|last1 = Sherman | first1 = Sarai|last2 = Morosini|first2 = Duilio|title = Sarai Sherman Opere 1971-77|publisher = [[Edizioni Trentadue]]|location = Italy|year = 1977|doi = |isbn = }}</ref>\n\n\u201cIn Sherman\u2019s work there is a consistent involvement with a visualization of distorted values in the continuum of social generalization.  During 1962 she completed a series of large composition paintings that focused on the death of the matrix of post World War II sex symbols. The capacity of Sherman to use the ambivalence inherent in metaphorical values, as a springboard in the employ of tonal color, immersed in diffused light has also made it possible to retain a sensitivity towards a younger generation\u2019s milieu.  Her work in the 1970s reflected a shift in the pictorialization of generalized meanings; a constantly precarious situation for all painters of Sherman\u2019s generations.\u201d<ref name=Duilio/>\n\nOverarching themes in Sherman's work focused on concerns with humankind's inhumanity to one another, where form and content are one.\n\n===Ceramics===\nSherman began exploring three-dimensional form in ceramic sculpture in the early 1980s.  The contemplative work from this period presents serne animal and human forms to the viewers gaze. The organic sensual shapes evoke or are explicitly feminine in form. The tactile and often delicate porcelain work were metaphorical juxtapositions of fundamental dualities: peace and war, life and death.<ref>{{cite book|title = Sarai Sherman: Ceramic Sculpture|publisher = Madison Gallery|location = Toronto|year = 1986|doi =|isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===[[Guzzetti Chapel]] (Cappella Guzzetti), Camera Picta, Cortona Italia===\nBetween 1987 and 1994 Sherman created major site-specific fresco and [[altarpiece]] commission in [[Cortona]], Italy for the [[Guzzetti Chapel]] on the grounds of the Villa Corono. The [[fresco]] cycle called Camera Picta are painted on the walls of the 18th century building owned by the Italian art patrons the Guzzettis. The allegorical work focus on the biblical and secular themes including sheep, bucolic landscape and flora.<ref>{{cite book|last = Sarai|first = Sherman|title = Camera Picta|publisher = [[University of Washington Press]]|location = Italy|year = 1994|doi=|isbn = }}</ref>  The paintings are saturated in muted tones and soft umber, ochre and cream colors that recall her work of the 1950s.  The full commission included paintings, sculpture and architectural [[trompe l\u2019oeil]]. The altar-piece, (1992-1994) utilizes three-dimensional ceramic forms, a rendering of sheep in repetition as biblical symbolism.\n\n==Legacy==\nSherman's work is included in numerous private and public permanent collections including the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) New York; the [[Whitney Museum of Art]], New York;<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Goodrich | first1 = Lloyd|last2 = Bryant | first2 = Edward|title = Forty Artists Under Forty From the Collection of The Whitney Museum of American Art|publisher = [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]|location = New York|year = 1962|doi = |isbn = }}</ref> [[Syracuse University]]; [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], Washington, DC; the [[National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome]]; the [[Uffizi Gallery]], Florence, Italy; Sconci Art Gallery, Dubai; Jerusalem Museum, Israel; National Gallery of Modern Art, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia; International Museum of Modern Art, Skopje, Yugoslavia; Gramsci Museum, Ghilarza, Sardinia.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Heller | first1 = Jules|last2 = Heller | first2 = Nancy G.|title = North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary|publisher = Il Bisonte|location = Firenze, Italy|year = 1964|doi = |isbn = }}</ref>\n\nSherman died in New York City on October 24, 2013.\n\n==Awards==\n\n* 1949 Pepsi Cola Award, USA\n* 1952 [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Grant]] in Painting, Italy \n* 1964 Award for Painting, [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]], New York, USA \n* 1964 Premio Cecina, Italy \n* 1965 Premio Resistenza, Pistoia\n* 1965 Premio San Giovanni (Gold medal from the President of the Senate)\n* 1967 Premio Marzotto (Special Citation) \n* 1969 Premio Acireale (Silver Medal)\n* 1970 Childe Hassan Purchase Prize, [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]], New York, USA\n* 1975 Premio San Marino, [[Republic of San Marino]] \n* 1976 [[Proctor Prize]], National Academy of Design, New York.\n\n==Selected group exhibitions==\n\n* 1949 Whitney Museum of Art, New York, Annual Exhibitions of Contemporary American Painting\n* 1950 Whitney Museum of Art, New York, Annual Exhibitions of Contemporary American Painting\n* 1952 Art Institute of Chicago, Contemporary Drawings From 12 Countries 1946 -1952\n* 1953 Brooklyn Museum, New York, 17th Biennial.\n* 1955 Whitney Museum of Art, New York, Annual Exhibitions of Contemporary American Painting  \n* 1958 Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC, Fulbright Painters\n* 1959 Whitney Museum of Art, Annual Exhibitions of Contemporary American Painting\n* 1960 Museum of Modern Art, New York, New Acquisitions\n* 1962 Whitney Museum of Art, New York, Forty Artists Under Forty\n* 1963 Whitney Museum of Art, New York, Annual Exhibitions of Contemporary American Painting  \n* 1971 Whitney Museum of Art, New York, Biennial of Painting\n* 1971 Women in the Whitney, Museum of American Art, New York\n* 1971 Contemporary Italian Graphics, Museum of Modern Art, Haifa and Ein Harod Neghev, Israel\n* 1972 Grafica di Oggi, International Biennal of Venice\n* 1974 Rassegna Internazionale d'Arte Presente, Rebubblica Amalfitana\n* 1974 International Portraiture, Albissola \n* 1975 Museum of Modern Art, New York, A Museum Menagerie\n* 1975 Arte Fano\n* 1975 Contemporary Graphics, Language and Generations in Confrontation, Vicenza\n* 1976 National Academy of Design Painting Annual, New York\n* 1976 Museum Menagerie, Museum of Modern Art, New York\n* 1977 International Biennnal of Premio Fiorino, Strozzi Palace, Florence\n* 2016 MAGI900 Museo d'arte, Women at Work, Bologna, Italy\n\n==Selected solo exhibitions 1950-1965==\n\n* 1951 ACA Gallery, New York, New York \n* 1955 ACA Gallery, New York, New York \n* 1955 Galleria dello Zodizco, Rome, Italy \n* 1958 ACA Gallery, New York, New York \n* 1960 ACA Gallery, New York, New York \n* 1961 Galleria delle Ore, Milan, Italy \n* 1961 Galleria La Nuova Pesa, Rome, Italy \n* 1963 Galleria La Polena, Genoa, Italy\n* 1963 Galleria delle Ore, Milan, Italy \n* 1963 Galleria Viotti, Turin, Italy \n* 1963 Forum Gallery, New York, New York  \n* 1963 Gallery Penelope, Rome, Italy \n* 1963 Galleria L'Incontro, Salerno, Italy \n* 1964 Galleria Lerici, Carrara, Italy \n* 1964 Fairweather-Hardin Gallery, Chicago Illinois\n* 1964 Galleria Il Sedile, Lecce, Italy\n* 1964 Galleria Il Portico, Reggio Emilia\n* 1964 Gallery Penelope, Rome, Italy \n* 1964 Galleria L'Incontro, Taranto, Italy \n* 1965 Galleria Trentadue, Milan, Italy \n* 1965 Museum of Contemporary Art, Skopje.\n\n==Published portfolios==\n* 1964 The Bachae, Ed.

Retrieved 3 June 2018</ref>\n\n==Course==\nThe Findhorn rises in the Coignafearn Forest north of the main massif of the [[Monadhliath Mountains]], several streams joining together near the Dalbeg bothy to form it. The westernmost of these is the River Eskin which flows down through a small valley surrounded by the heights of C\u00e0rn a' Choire Sheilich {{convert|791|m}}, C\u00e0rn nan L\u00e0raiche Maoile {{convert|809|m}} and C\u00e0rn na Saobhaidh {{convert|766|m}}. To the south west the Abhainn Cro-chlach takes a direct route along a narrow and steep-sided defile that carries its waters from Carn Odhar na Criche {{convert|895|m}} and C\u00e0rn B\u00e0n {{convert|942|m}}. The two join by a small bridge in the heart of the Coignafearn Forest (which is a Scottish [[deer forest]] and devoid of trees). Arguably this is the point, some {{convert|500|m}} above sea level, at which the Findhorn itself is born but less than kilometre downstream the Allt Creagach joins them at Dalbeg and from here on this is unquestionably the Findhorn River.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}} [[Strath]] Dearn descends from here in a southwesterly direction until the river reaches its outlet to the [[Moray Firth]]. \n[[File:River Findhorn near Coignafearn Lodge - geograph.org.uk - 1183575.jpg|thumb|left|Findhorn River near its headwaters in the Coignafearn [[deer forest]]]]\nIn its upper reaches the river is unusually sinuous, being an incised meandering river valley very little altered by glaciers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bremner|first1=A|title=The River Findhorn|journal=Scottish Geographical Magazine|date=1939|volume=55|issue=2|pages=65\u201385|doi=10.1080/00369223908735107}}</ref> The next tributary to join the flow is the Elrick Burn, a substantial rivulet whose head waters are in the Monadhliaths east of the Abhainn Cro-chlach. Its confluence with the Findhorn is just south of the Coignafearn Lodge. {{convert|2|km}} further east is the first wooded area of the valley, on the left bank below Creag Irealis and just upstream from Coignafearn Old Lodge. Some {{convert|4|km}} downstream beyond the cliffs of Creag Dubh the valley takes on a definitely wooded appearance, although the surrounding hills remain bare [[Calluna|heather]] moor.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}} \n[[File:The Gorge at Dulsie Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 1438691.jpg|thumb|Gorge at Dulsie Bridge]]\nThe Glenmazaran Burn is the next tributary on the right bank, and various farms and lodges provide habitation from here throughout most of the river's remaining length. [[Tomatin]] is the first settlement of any size on the river's banks and here the waters pass under both the [[Highland Main Line]] railway and the [[A9 road (Great Britain)|A9 road]]. Just beyond this the Allt Bruachaig tumbles down from the heights of the [[Slochd Summit|Slochd Mor]] and joins the Findhorn on its right bank. Here the river takes its only major bend, a lazy S-shape over a {{convert|5|km}} stretch at the end of which the Funtack Burn, which drains [[Loch Moy]] to the north, joins the Findhorn's left bank. Beyond this point the character of the landscape changes again as the river enters the Streens gorge. This {{convert|7|km}} long defile has no metalled road, is largely treeless and almost completely uninhabited.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}} \n\nAt Drynachan lodge the valley reverts to its earlier wooded and inhabited character and roads again follow its course almost all the way to the sea. The river is joined by the Carnoch Burn and flows almost due east from here, passing the {{convert|200|m}} contour, and then shortly afterwards it is met by the Tor Burn on the right bank. This stream is only about a {{convert|1|km}} long, being formed by the confluence of the Rhilean and Leonach Burns, which flow through moorland before cascading down narrow gorges and over waterfalls in their final sections. There is a small, wooded river island in the Findhorn at the point at which it is joined by the Tor Burn - one of the few such islands along its length, none of which are named by the [[Ordnance Survey]]. Next, the river reaches the remains of the [[hillfort]] of [[Dunearn]] just south of Dulsie Bridge. Here the Findhorn turns northwards and flows through a sinuous and narrow gorge with [[Glenferness]] House on the right bank and the [[Ardclach]] bell tower on the left, after which it reverts to a generally north-westerly course once it passes under the [[A939 road|A939]] bridge.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}}\n\nBeyond Relugas the Findhorn is joined by the River Divie at the beauty spot of [[Randolph's Leap]]. The Divie's head waters lie in the hills to the south of the prominent [[Knock of Braemoray]], and shortly before its confluence with the Findhorn it is itself joined by the [[Dorback Burn, Findhorn|Dorback Burn]], which is fed by [[Lochindorb]].{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}} Hereafter the waters provide kayaking opportunities for the experienced for the next {{convert|4|km}}<ref>[https://www.ukriversguidebook.co.uk/rivers/scotland/north-east/river-findhorn-randolphs-leap-to-mains-of-sluie \"River Findhorn - Gorge\"].

Rather confusingly, Dun Earn sits above the Dunearn Burn near its confluence with the Findhorn about {{convert|12|km}} downstream from Dunearn.}} Sluie Walk where it crosses the {{convert|100|m}} contour, the Altyre estate and the Meads of St John before reaching the hamlet of Mundole just outside the town of [[Forres]], which is by far the largest settlement on the river's route. Passing under the Findhorn Bridge on the [[A96 road|A96]] and the main [[Aberdeen\u2013Inverness line|Inverness to Aberdeen railway line]] the river finally reaches relatively flat land just {{convert|3|km}} before it reaches [[Findhorn Bay]]. This is a large tidal basin and at low water the river is joined by the Muckle, Mosset and Kinloss Burns as it flows unimpeded over its sands. The combined streams flow on to the north with the village and military base of [[Kinloss]] to the right, crossing the bay and passing [[Findhorn Ecovillage]] and the harbour of the village of [[Findhorn]] before exiting the bay through a narrow, sandy channel and entering the [[Moray Firth]] with the [[Culbin Forest]] on the left. At higher stages of the tide the riverine waters mix with the incoming sea, creating a brackish lagoon.{{sfnp|Gordon|1993|p=19}}{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}}\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Beach at Findhorn - geograph.org.uk - 187206.jpg|thumb|The white sands of the beach at [[Findhorn]]]]\nThe derivation of the name 'Findhorn' is not absolutely clear. [[William J. Watson|Watson]] (1926) states that it is derived from Gaelic ''Fionn \u00c8ire'', meaning \"white Ireland\" which  \"doubtless refers to the white sands of the estuary\".{{sfnp|Watson|1926|p=229-230}}{{efn|Gordon speculates that the description \"white\" refers to the \"white-foaming torrent\" of the river after snow melt.{{sfnp|Gordon|1993|p=19}}}} The [[genitive]] ''[[wikt:\u00c8ireann|\u00c8ireann]]'' then gave rise to the use of the anglicized 'earn' or 'erne' in other local names such as Invererne and Dunearn.{{sfnp|Watson|1926|p=229-230}}{{efn|Nicolaisen discusses the notion that the incoming Gaelic speakers - whose language replaced that of the [[Pictish language|Picts]] - named various locations in Moray after their homeland of Ireland, after Watson (1926). However, he finds the argument lacking and suggests that the second syllable in Findhorn, [[Auldearn]] and [[River Deveron|Deveron]] may reflect a pre-Gaelic, or even pre-[[Celts|Celtic]], name.{{sfnp|Nicolaisen|1993|pp=260-61}} See also Mac an T\u00e0illeir's comments about Coignafearn below.}} \n\n'Burn' is a [[Scots language]] word for stream although most of the names referred to above are of Gaelic origin. Other common tributary names include ''abhainn'' (river or stream) and ''allt'' (brook, burn or stream).{{sfnp|Bauer|Robertson|2016}} \n\nMonadhliath is ''Am Monadh Liath'' in Gaelic and means grey mountain range and ''C\u00e0rn'' means a [[cairn]] or heap of stones.{{sfnp|Bauer|Robertson|2016}} Coignafearn is from ''C\u00f3ig na Fe\u00e0rna'' and means \"the fifth of the alder\", in this case \"fifth\" referring to a fraction of a [[davoch]], a land measurement that could be subdivided into halves, quarters or fifths.{{efn|Mac an T\u00e0illeir (2003) states that Strathdearn \"contains five c\u00f3igs, Coignafearn, Coignascallan, C\u00f3ig na S\u00ecthe, C\u00f3ig a' Mhuilinn and C\u00f3ig nam Fionndaraich. There is a saying comparing the five divisions of Strathdearn (which means the strath of Ireland, referring to the Findhorn River) with those of Ireland, ''Tha c\u00f3ig c\u00f3igimh an \u00c9irinn 's tha c\u00f3ig c\u00f3igimh an Srath \u00c9ireann, ach 's fhe\u00e0rr aon ch\u00f3igeamh na h-\u00c9ireann na c\u00f3ig c\u00f3igimh Srath \u00c9ireann'', 'There are five fifths in Ireland and five fifths in the strath of Ireland, but one fifth of Ireland is better than five fifths of the strath of Ireland'. The distinctiveness of Strathdearn's placenames is commented on in another saying, ''Tha c\u00f3ig bothan an Loch Abar, c\u00f3ig gasgan ann am B\u00e0ideanach 's c\u00f3ig c\u00f3igean ann an Srath \u00c9ireann'', 'there are five boths in Lochaber, five gasgs in Badenoch and five c\u00f3igs in Strathdearn'.\"{{sfnp|Mac an T\u00e0illeir|2003|pp=30-31}}}} Amongst the main settlements Tomatin is from ''Tom Aitinn'' meaning \"juniper hillock\",{{sfnp|Mac an T\u00e0illeir|2003|p=113}} Forres is from ''farrais'', a small copse {{sfnp|Mac an T\u00e0illeir|2003|p=50}} and Kinloss from ''cinn lois'', herb headland.{{sfnp|Mac an T\u00e0illeir|2003|p=74}}\n\n==Geology and geomorphology==\n[[File:MainlandMoineOutcrop.png|thumb|Map of the distribution of the [[Moine Supergroup]] on mainland Scotland and the [[Inner Hebrides]]]]\nDuring the [[Caledonian orogeny]], some 500 [[Mya (unit)|mya]], much of the land that is now northern Scotland was subject to [[Fold (geology)|folding]] and [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosis]] and then [[intrusion|intruded]] with [[granite]] [[magma]] which contributed to the uplift of the area and ultimately the creation of the [[Grampian mountains]] of which the Monadliaths that form the head waters of the river Findhorn are a part.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|p=1}} The bedrock of the upper Findhorn is largely made up of the Grampian Division of the [[Moine Supergroup]], a formation that stretched from south of Forres to Lochindorb and beyond. These rocks are typically metamorphosed sediments of [[sandstone]] that are rich in [[quartz]] mixed with some [[shale]] and [[mudstone]] that date from circa 750 mya. {{sfnp|Gillen|1993|pp=2-3}} The [[schist]]s that underlay the Streens in the middle reaches of the Findhorn were once thought to be part of the younger [[Dalriadan Supergroup]] but are now considered to be Moinian as well.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|p=1}} The Grampian Slide is a zone of shearing between the younger Grampian Division and the older Central Highland Division.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|p=1}}\n\nIn the lower Findhorn the bedrock is [[Old Red Sandstone]] that was deposited after the Caledonian orogeny. The rapid uplift of the mountain terrain to the south was accompanied by similarly rapid river erosion that resulted in sediment being spread throughout the Moray Firth basin and further north to [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] some 360\u2013400 mya. At this time the land lay some 20 degrees south of the equator and experienced a semi-arid climate.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|pp=6-8}}\n\nDuring the [[Tertiary]] period some 65\u201350 mya volcanic activity on what is now the west coast of Scotland resulted in considerable uplift there and the creation of the slope that dips in an easterly direction that the modern Findhorn river follows.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|pp=15-17}}\n\nWith the onset of [[Pleistocene]] glacial period some 2 mya the whole of northern Scotland became ice-bound. For example, the [[Cairngorms|Cairngorm]] mountains immediately to the south of the Findhorn valley became covered in ice some {{convert|1800|m}} thick. The melting of the ice, which occurred comparatively rapidly, resulted in \"vast volumes of meltwater\" creating further erosional and depositional features, such as [[river terrace]]s in the middle reaches of the Findhorn{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|pp=16-17}} and [[moraine]]s such as the Cluny hills downstream.{{sfnp|Isaksen|2017|p=4}} \n[[File:Culbin Forest, Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|Looking from the Culbin forest towards the shifting coastal sand bars with the [[Moray Firth]] beyond]]\nThe great weight of the ice depressed the land surface and with the end of the glacial period there resulted both sea level rises and [[isostasy|isostatic]] rebound of the land which combined with periodic uplifts resulted in a complex interplay of land and sea{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|p=19}}{{sfnp|Ross|1992|pp=48-56}} with a prominent raised shoreline between Nairn and Forres that skirts the Culbin Forest.{{sfnp|Ross|1992|p=48}}\n\nHowever, the shores have not been static even in historic times. The earliest detailed map of the Findhorn estuary dates from 1590 and was made by [[Timothy Pont]].

In 1701 this bar was described as being {{convert|6|mi}} long after it was breached by the sea close its eastern edge.{{sfnp|Ross|1992|p=8}} At this point what is now the Culbin Forest on the river's left bank was a sandy waste with dunes reaching to {{convert|30|m}} in height{{sfnp|Ross|1992|p=1}} and the river channel through Findhorn Bay was slowly shallowing due to the wind-blown sands.{{sfnp|Ross|1992|p=8}} Noticing the erosion to the bar, on which the village had been built, the inhabitants gradually deserted this site and moved to a new location about {{convert|1.6|km}} to the south east,{{sfnp|Ross|1992|p=8}} where the modern village now stands.{{sfnp|Ross|1992|p=76-77}}\n\n==Iron Age settlement==\n[[File:Colindoune - geograph.org.uk - 540928.jpg|thumb|[[Dunearn]] hill fort]]\nDunearn (near Dulsie Bridge), <ref>[https://canmore.org.uk/site/15497/dunearn \"Dunearn\"].

The westernmost of these is the River Eskin which flows down through a small valley surrounded by the heights of C\u00e0rn a' Choire Sheilich {{convert|791|m}}, C\u00e0rn nan L\u00e0raiche Maoile {{convert|809|m}} and C\u00e0rn na Saobhaidh {{convert|766|m}}.

The two join by a small bridge in the heart of the Coignafearn Forest (which is a Scottish [[deer forest]] and devoid of trees). Arguably this is the point, some {{convert|500|m}} above sea level, at which the Findhorn itself is born but less than kilometre downstream the Allt Creagach joins them at Dalbeg and from here on this is unquestionably the Findhorn River.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}} [[Strath]] Dearn descends from here in a southwesterly direction until the river reaches its outlet to the [[Moray Firth]]. \n[[File:River Findhorn near Coignafearn Lodge - geograph.org.uk - 1183575.jpg|thumb|left|Findhorn River near its headwaters in the Coignafearn [[deer forest]]]]\nIn its upper reaches the river is unusually sinuous, being an incised meandering river valley very little altered by glaciers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bremner|first1=A|title=The River Findhorn|journal=Scottish Geographical Magazine|date=1939|volume=55|issue=2|pages=65\u201385|doi=10.1080/00369223908735107}}</ref> The next tributary to join the flow is the Elrick Burn, a substantial rivulet whose head waters are in the Monadhliaths east of the Abhainn Cro-chlach.

[[Tomatin]] is the first settlement of any size on the river's banks and here the waters pass under both the [[Highland Main Line]] railway and the [[A9 road (Great Britain)|A9 road]]. Just beyond this the Allt Bruachaig tumbles down from the heights of the [[Slochd Summit|Slochd Mor]] and joins the Findhorn on its right bank. Here the river takes its only major bend, a lazy S-shape over a {{convert|5|km}} stretch at the end of which the Funtack Burn, which drains [[Loch Moy]] to the north, joins the Findhorn's left bank. Beyond this point the character of the landscape changes again as the river enters the Streens gorge. This {{convert|7|km}} long defile has no metalled road, is largely treeless and almost completely uninhabited.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}} \n\nAt Drynachan lodge the valley reverts to its earlier wooded and inhabited character and roads again follow its course almost all the way to the sea. The river is joined by the Carnoch Burn and flows almost due east from here, passing the {{convert|200|m}} contour, and then shortly afterwards it is met by the Tor Burn on the right bank. This stream is only about a {{convert|1|km}} long, being formed by the confluence of the Rhilean and Leonach Burns, which flow through moorland before cascading down narrow gorges and over waterfalls in their final sections. There is a small, wooded river island in the Findhorn at the point at which it is joined by the Tor Burn - one of the few such islands along its length, none of which are named by the [[Ordnance Survey]]. Next, the river reaches the remains of the [[hillfort]] of [[Dunearn]] just south of Dulsie Bridge. Here the Findhorn turns northwards and flows through a sinuous and narrow gorge with [[Glenferness]] House on the right bank and the [[Ardclach]] bell tower on the left, after which it reverts to a generally north-westerly course once it passes under the [[A939 road|A939]] bridge.{{sfnp|Ordnance Survey|2018}}\n\nBeyond Relugas the Findhorn is joined by the River Divie at the beauty spot of [[Randolph's Leap]].

Watson|Watson]] (1926) states that it is derived from Gaelic ''Fionn \u00c8ire'', meaning \"white Ireland\" which  \"doubtless refers to the white sands of the estuary\".{{sfnp|Watson|1926|p=229-230}}{{efn|Gordon speculates that the description \"white\" refers to the \"white-foaming torrent\" of the river after snow melt.{{sfnp|Gordon|1993|p=19}}}} The [[genitive]] ''[[wikt:\u00c8ireann|\u00c8ireann]]'' then gave rise to the use of the anglicized 'earn' or 'erne' in other local names such as Invererne and Dunearn.{{sfnp|Watson|1926|p=229-230}}{{efn|Nicolaisen discusses the notion that the incoming Gaelic speakers - whose language replaced that of the [[Pictish language|Picts]] - named various locations in Moray after their homeland of Ireland, after Watson (1926). However, he finds the argument lacking and suggests that the second syllable in Findhorn, [[Auldearn]] and [[River Deveron|Deveron]] may reflect a pre-Gaelic, or even pre-[[Celts|Celtic]], name.{{sfnp|Nicolaisen|1993|pp=260-61}} See also Mac an T\u00e0illeir's comments about Coignafearn below.}} \n\n'Burn' is a [[Scots language]] word for stream although most of the names referred to above are of Gaelic origin. Other common tributary names include ''abhainn'' (river or stream) and ''allt'' (brook, burn or stream).{{sfnp|Bauer|Robertson|2016}} \n\nMonadhliath is ''Am Monadh Liath'' in Gaelic and means grey mountain range and ''C\u00e0rn'' means a [[cairn]] or heap of stones.{{sfnp|Bauer|Robertson|2016}} Coignafearn is from ''C\u00f3ig na Fe\u00e0rna'' and means \"the fifth of the alder\", in this case \"fifth\" referring to a fraction of a [[davoch]], a land measurement that could be subdivided into halves, quarters or fifths.{{efn|Mac an T\u00e0illeir (2003) states that Strathdearn \"contains five c\u00f3igs, Coignafearn, Coignascallan, C\u00f3ig na S\u00ecthe, C\u00f3ig a' Mhuilinn and C\u00f3ig nam Fionndaraich. There is a saying comparing the five divisions of Strathdearn (which means the strath of Ireland, referring to the Findhorn River) with those of Ireland, ''Tha c\u00f3ig c\u00f3igimh an \u00c9irinn 's tha c\u00f3ig c\u00f3igimh an Srath \u00c9ireann, ach 's fhe\u00e0rr aon ch\u00f3igeamh na h-\u00c9ireann na c\u00f3ig c\u00f3igimh Srath \u00c9ireann'', 'There are five fifths in Ireland and five fifths in the strath of Ireland, but one fifth of Ireland is better than five fifths of the strath of Ireland'. The distinctiveness of Strathdearn's placenames is commented on in another saying, ''Tha c\u00f3ig bothan an Loch Abar, c\u00f3ig gasgan ann am B\u00e0ideanach 's c\u00f3ig c\u00f3igean ann an Srath \u00c9ireann'', 'there are five boths in Lochaber, five gasgs in Badenoch and five c\u00f3igs in Strathdearn'.\"{{sfnp|Mac an T\u00e0illeir|2003|pp=30-31}}}} Amongst the main settlements Tomatin is from ''Tom Aitinn'' meaning \"juniper hillock\",{{sfnp|Mac an T\u00e0illeir|2003|p=113}} Forres is from ''farrais'', a small copse {{sfnp|Mac an T\u00e0illeir|2003|p=50}} and Kinloss from ''cinn lois'', herb headland.{{sfnp|Mac an T\u00e0illeir|2003|p=74}}\n\n==Geology and geomorphology==\n[[File:MainlandMoineOutcrop.png|thumb|Map of the distribution of the [[Moine Supergroup]] on mainland Scotland and the [[Inner Hebrides]]]]\nDuring the [[Caledonian orogeny]], some 500 [[Mya (unit)|mya]], much of the land that is now northern Scotland was subject to [[Fold (geology)|folding]] and [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosis]] and then [[intrusion|intruded]] with [[granite]] [[magma]] which contributed to the uplift of the area and ultimately the creation of the [[Grampian mountains]] of which the Monadliaths that form the head waters of the river Findhorn are a part.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|p=1}} The bedrock of the upper Findhorn is largely made up of the Grampian Division of the [[Moine Supergroup]], a formation that stretched from south of Forres to Lochindorb and beyond. These rocks are typically metamorphosed sediments of [[sandstone]] that are rich in [[quartz]] mixed with some [[shale]] and [[mudstone]] that date from circa 750 mya. {{sfnp|Gillen|1993|pp=2-3}} The [[schist]]s that underlay the Streens in the middle reaches of the Findhorn were once thought to be part of the younger [[Dalriadan Supergroup]] but are now considered to be Moinian as well.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|p=1}} The Grampian Slide is a zone of shearing between the younger Grampian Division and the older Central Highland Division.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|p=1}}\n\nIn the lower Findhorn the bedrock is [[Old Red Sandstone]] that was deposited after the Caledonian orogeny. The rapid uplift of the mountain terrain to the south was accompanied by similarly rapid river erosion that resulted in sediment being spread throughout the Moray Firth basin and further north to [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] some 360\u2013400 mya. At this time the land lay some 20 degrees south of the equator and experienced a semi-arid climate.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|pp=6-8}}\n\nDuring the [[Tertiary]] period some 65\u201350 mya volcanic activity on what is now the west coast of Scotland resulted in considerable uplift there and the creation of the slope that dips in an easterly direction that the modern Findhorn river follows.{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|pp=15-17}}\n\nWith the onset of [[Pleistocene]] glacial period some 2 mya the whole of northern Scotland became ice-bound. For example, the [[Cairngorms|Cairngorm]] mountains immediately to the south of the Findhorn valley became covered in ice some {{convert|1800|m}} thick. The melting of the ice, which occurred comparatively rapidly, resulted in \"vast volumes of meltwater\" creating further erosional and depositional features, such as [[river terrace]]s in the middle reaches of the Findhorn{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|pp=16-17}} and [[moraine]]s such as the Cluny hills downstream.{{sfnp|Isaksen|2017|p=4}} \n[[File:Culbin Forest, Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|Looking from the Culbin forest towards the shifting coastal sand bars with the [[Moray Firth]] beyond]]\nThe great weight of the ice depressed the land surface and with the end of the glacial period there resulted both sea level rises and [[isostasy|isostatic]] rebound of the land which combined with periodic uplifts resulted in a complex interplay of land and sea{{sfnp|Gillen|1993|p=19}}{{sfnp|Ross|1992|pp=48-56}} with a prominent raised shoreline between Nairn and Forres that skirts the Culbin Forest.{{sfnp|Ross|1992|p=48}}\n\nHowever, the shores have not been static even in historic times. The earliest detailed map of the Findhorn estuary dates from 1590 and was made by [[Timothy Pont]].

In 1701 this bar was described as being {{convert|6|mi}} long after it was breached by the sea close its eastern edge.{{sfnp|Ross|1992|p=8}} At this point what is now the Culbin Forest on the river's left bank was a sandy waste with dunes reaching to {{convert|30|m}} in height{{sfnp|Ross|1992|p=1}} and the river channel through Findhorn Bay was slowly shallowing due to the wind-blown sands.{{sfnp|Ross|1992|p=8}} Noticing the erosion to the bar, on which the village had been built, the inhabitants gradually deserted this site and moved to a new location about {{convert|1.6|km}} to the south east,{{sfnp|Ross|1992|p=8}} where the modern village now stands.{{sfnp|Ross|1992|p=76-77}}\n\n==Iron Age settlement==\n[[File:Colindoune - geograph.org.uk - 540928.jpg|thumb|[[Dunearn]] hill fort]]\nDunearn (near Dulsie Bridge), <ref>[https://canmore.org.uk/site/15497/dunearn \"Dunearn\"].
