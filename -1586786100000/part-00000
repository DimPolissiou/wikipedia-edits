In the 19th&nbsp;century, the city saw a huge expansion of its traditional cutlery trade, when [[stainless steel]] and [[crucible steel]] were developed locally, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population. Sheffield received its [[municipal charter]] in 1843, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893. International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in these industries in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area.\n\nThe 21st&nbsp;century has seen extensive [[Urban renewal|redevelopment]] in Sheffield, along with other British cities.  Sheffield's [[gross value added]] (GVA) has increased by 60% since 1997, standing at \u00a311.3&nbsp;billion in 2015. The economy has experienced steady growth averaging around 5% annually, greater than that of the broader region of Yorkshire and the Humber.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/sheffield-facts-figures/sheffield-economy/income--wealth \n |title=Income & Wealth \n |date=30 November 2007 \n |publisher=[[Sheffield City Council]] \n |accessdate=7 July 2010 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521085049/http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/sheffield-facts-figures/sheffield-economy/income--wealth \n |archivedate=21 May 2010 \n |url-status=live \n}}</ref>\n\nThe city has a long sporting heritage, and is home to the world's oldest football club, [[Sheffield F.C.]]<ref name=\"celebration\" /> Games between the two professional clubs, [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], are known as the [[Steel City derby]].

In the 19th&nbsp;century, the city saw a huge expansion of its traditional cutlery trade, when [[stainless steel]] and [[crucible steel]] were developed locally, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population. Sheffield received its [[municipal charter]] in 1843, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893. International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in these industries in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area.\n\nThe 21st&nbsp;century has seen extensive [[Urban renewal|redevelopment]] in Sheffield, along with other British cities.  Sheffield's [[gross value added]] (GVA) has increased by 60% since 1997, standing at \u00a311.3&nbsp;billion in 2015. The economy has experienced steady growth averaging around 5% annually, greater than that of the broader region of Yorkshire and the Humber.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/sheffield-facts-figures/sheffield-economy/income--wealth \n |title=Income & Wealth \n |date=30 November 2007 \n |publisher=[[Sheffield City Council]] \n |accessdate=7 July 2010 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521085049/http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/sheffield-facts-figures/sheffield-economy/income--wealth \n |archivedate=21 May 2010 \n |url-status=live \n}}</ref>\n\nThe city has a long sporting heritage, and is home to the world's oldest football club, [[Sheffield F.C.]]<ref name=\"celebration\" /> Games between the two professional clubs, [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], are known as the [[Steel City derby]].

Most of his projects from 1997 onwards were recorded at the [[Electrical Audio]] studios in Chicago. Albini is occasionally credited as a [[record producer]], though he dislikes the term to describe his work.  \n\nAs a musician, Albini has fronted the bands [[Big Black]], [[Rapeman]] and [[Shellac (band)|Shellac]] on guitar and vocals. He also played on other projects from time to time, notably as a bass guitarist the touring incarnation of Pete Conway's solo project [[Flour (band)|Flour]] whose records he also engineered.\n\nThe list is in chronological order by date of release, but is incomplete.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==As a musician==\n\n===Big Black, 1982\u20131987===\n*''[[Lungs (EP)|Lungs]]'' EP&nbsp;\u2013 (1982)\n*''[[Bulldozer (EP)|Bulldozer]]'' EP&nbsp;\u2013  (1983)\n*''[[Racer-X]]'' EP &nbsp;\u2013 (1984)\n*''Rema Rema'' 7\" &nbsp;\u2013 (1985)\n*''[[The Hammer Party]]''&nbsp;\u2013 (1985)\n*''Il Duce/Big Money''&nbsp;\u2013  7\" (1985)\n*''[[Atomizer (album)|Atomizer]]''&nbsp;\u2013 (1986)\n*''[[Sound of Impact]]'' live LP (1987)\n*''[[Heartbeat (Big Black single)|Heartbeat]]''&nbsp;\u2013 7\" (1987)\n*''[[Headache (EP)|Headache]]''&nbsp;\u2013 EP (1987)\n*''[[He's a Whore / The Model]]''&nbsp;\u2013 7\"\n*''The Incredibly Corporate Whorish Big Black Interview Album''&nbsp;\u2013 LP [[Touch and Go Records]] (1987)\n:    (aka Talk About Fucking) (Blast First!

Thomas Nightingale (d. 1645) who was appointed the [[High Sheriff of Essex]] in 1627. The fourth baronet, Sir. Robert Nightingale (d. 1722), was a Director of the [[Honourable East India Company]] in [[London]], [[England]]. After his death, the title and its assets should have passed down to Edward Nightingale (b. 1659 d. 1723). However, the estate was inherited by his younger cousin, [[Joseph Gascoigne Nightingale|Joseph Gascoigne]], who adopted the [[name]] and [[coat of arms]] of the family, but not the [[title]]. A [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Stafford]], who sat in the [[House of Commons]] from 1727 to 1734, [[Joseph Gascoigne Nightingale|Joseph]] was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] and married to Lady Elizabeth Shirley, who was the eldest daughter of [[Washington Shirley, 2nd Earl Ferrers]], of [[Chartley Castle|Chartley]] (m.1725). <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/member/gascoigne-nightingale-joseph-1695-1752|title=GASCOIGNE NIGHTINGALE, Joseph (1695-1752), of Enfield, Mdx. &#124; History of Parliament Online|website=www.historyofparliamentonline.org}}</ref> She, unfortunately, died following the premature birth of her eldest daughter. Together, she and Joseph had three sons named Washington, Joseph, and Robert. Shortly after her death, Elizabeth's first two sons also died, leaving just Washington and his father alive. \n\nAfter ending his time as a [[Member of Parliament]], Joseph later moved to [[Mamhead House]] in [[Devon]] for respite and recovery, but died in July of 1752. He and his wife, Lady Elizabeth, were later buried in the North Ambulatory of [[Westminster Abbey]]. Grieving for the loss of his family, Washington created a monument located in aforementioned, sculpted by [[Louis-Francois Roubiliac]]. The [[sculpture]] is seen depicting a skeleton, representing death, emerging from his prison to aim a deadly dart at Elizabeth, who is being protected by her husband. Dying two years after his father in 1754, Washington never saw the monument completed, which was finished in 1761. Unfortunately, he died with no heir apparent and the rights to the title and its coat of arms were later established by Sir. Edward Nightingale (b.1760 d.1804), who became the 10th Baronet in 1797.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/commemorations/lady-elizabeth-joseph-nightingale|title=Lady Elizabeth & Joseph Nightingale|first=Westminster|last=Abbey|website=Westminster Abbey}}</ref>\n\n[[File: Lady Elizabeth Nightingale and Joseph Nightingale, St Michaels Chapel, Westminster Abbey.jpeg|450x450px|thumb|left|Monument commemorating Lady Elizabeth Nightingale and Joseph Nightingale in St Michael's Chapel, Westminster Abbey, London. |alt=]]\n\nCaptain Gamaliel Nightingale (b.1731 d.1791), ''[[de jure]]'' 9th Bt was another notable figure in the Nightingale family.

For example, Sir. Charles Ethelston Nightingale (11th Baronet) was a [[Lieutenant]] in the [[Queens Guard|Third Foot Guards]]. His grandson, Sir. Henry Dickonson Nightingale (13th Baronet) was a [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] in the [[Royal Marines]] who served during the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]], from 1851-1852. His son, Sir.

The family originally came from [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]], after immigrating from [[Normandy]]. Here, they held a prominent seat at Brome Hall in [[Brome, Suffolk|Brome]], which was given to them by [[William the Conqueror]] (the [[Duke of Normandy]]) for their services and contributions during the [[Battle of Hastings]], in 1066. The family later moved to their main ancestral seat at [[Kneesworth Hall]] of [[Bassingbourn cum Kneesworth]], [[Cambridgeshire]], where they eventually stayed for over 200 [[years]]. This move was precipitated by Geoffrey Nightingale (b.1550 d.1619), father of Sir. Thomas Nightingale, 1st Bt (b.1577 d.1645), who purchased the estate in 1597. Geoffrey was a [[lawyer]] who provided [[estate management]] for various [[landed gentry]]. In 1600, he acquired 200 [[acres]] of land in Bassingbourn and Kneesworth, and another 350 acres later on. By 1695, his grandson, Edward Nightingale (b.1658 d.1723), owned approximately 725 acres and acquired an additional 100 acres from Sir. Henry Pickering, Lord of Whaddon. By 1797, Sir. Edward Nightingale, 10th bt (b.1760 d.1804), had inherited a real estate portfolio of 880 acres of land in Kneesworth, 130 acres leased from the [[University of Cambridge]], and 200 acres in [[Bassingbourn cum Kneesworth|Bassingbourn]]. The estate was later sold by Sir. Lt. Charles Ethelston Nightingale, 11th Bt (b.1784 d.1843), in 1814 and 1831, which totaled 897 acres. The family also held strong links with the local [[parish church]] of [[Saint Peter|St. Peters]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul\u2019s]], where many members of the baronetcy and their respective families are still buried. In 1717, Edward Nightingale, ''[[de jure]]'' 5th Bt (b.1658 d. 1723) founded and created the [[library]] belonging to the church.

A [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Stafford]], who sat in the [[House of Commons]] from 1727 to 1734, [[Joseph Gascoigne Nightingale|Joseph]] was educated at [[Trinity College]] and married to Lady Elizabeth Shirley, who was the eldest daughter of [[Washington Shirley, 2nd Earl Ferrers]], of [[Chartley Castle|Chartley]] (m.1725). <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/member/gascoigne-nightingale-joseph-1695-1752|title=GASCOIGNE NIGHTINGALE, Joseph (1695-1752), of Enfield, Mdx. &#124; History of Parliament Online|website=www.historyofparliamentonline.org}}</ref> She, unfortunately, died following the premature birth of her eldest daughter. Together, she and Joseph had three sons named Washington, Joseph, and Robert. Shortly after her death, Elizabeth's first two sons also died, leaving just Washington and his father alive. \n\nAfter ending his time as a [[Member of Parliament]], Joseph later moved to [[Mamhead House]] in [[Devon]] for respite and recovery, but died in July of 1752. He and his wife, Lady Elizabeth, were later buried in the North Ambulatory of [[Westminster Abbey]]. Grieving for the loss of his family, Washington created a monument located in aforementioned, sculpted by [[Louis-Francois Roubiliac]]. The [[sculpture]] is seen depicting a skeleton, representing death, emerging from his prison to aim a deadly dart at Elizabeth, who is being protected by her husband. Dying two years after his father in 1754, Washington never saw the monument completed, which was finished in 1761. Unfortunately, he died with no heir apparent and the rights to the title and its coat of arms were later established by Sir. Edward Nightingale (b.1760 d.1804), who became the 10th Baronet in 1797.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/commemorations/lady-elizabeth-joseph-nightingale|title=Lady Elizabeth & Joseph Nightingale|first=Westminster|last=Abbey|website=Westminster Abbey}}</ref>\n\n[[File: Lady Elizabeth Nightingale and Joseph Nightingale, St Michaels Chapel, Westminster Abbey.jpeg|450x450px|thumb|left|Monument commemorating Lady Elizabeth Nightingale and Joseph Nightingale in St Michael's Chapel, Westminster Abbey, London. |alt=]]\n\nCaptain Gamaliel Nightingale (b.1731 d.1791), ''[[de jure]]'' 9th Bt was another notable figure in the Nightingale family.

For example, Sir. Charles Ethelston Nightingale (11th Baronet) was a [[Lieutenant]] in the [[Queens Guard|Third Foot Guards]]. His grandson, Sir. Henry Dickonson Nightingale (13th Baronet) was a [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] in the [[Royal Marines]] who served during the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]], from 1851-1852. His son, Sir.

The family originally came from [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]], after immigrating from [[Normandy]]. Here, they held a prominent seat at Brome Hall in [[Brome, Suffolk|Brome]], which was given to them by [[William the Conqueror]] (the [[Duke of Normandy]]) for their services and contributions during the [[Battle of Hastings]], in 1066. The family later moved to their main ancestral seat at [[Kneesworth Hall]] of [[Bassingbourn cum Kneesworth]], [[Cambridgeshire]], where they eventually stayed for over 200 [[years]]. This move was precipitated by Geoffrey Nightingale (b.1550 d.1619), father of Sir. Thomas Nightingale, 1st Bt (b.1577 d.1645), who purchased the estate in 1597. Geoffrey was a [[lawyer]] who provided [[estate management]] for various [[landed gentry]]. In 1600, he acquired 200 [[acres]] of land in Bassingbourn and Kneesworth, and another 350 acres later on. By 1695, his grandson, Edward Nightingale (b.1658 d.1723), owned approximately 725 acres and acquired an additional 100 acres from Sir. Henry Pickering, Lord of Whaddon. By 1797, Sir. Edward Nightingale, 10th bt (b.1760 d.1804), had inherited a real estate portfolio of 880 acres of land in Kneesworth, 130 acres leased from the [[University of Cambridge]], and 200 acres in [[Bassingbourn cum Kneesworth|Bassingbourn]]. The estate was later sold by Sir. Lt. Charles Ethelston Nightingale, 11th Bt (b.1784 d.1843), in 1814 and 1831, which totaled 897 acres. The family also held strong links with the local [[parish church]] of [[Saint Peter|St. Peters]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul\u2019s]], where many members of the baronetcy and their respective families are still buried. In 1717, Edward Nightingale, ''[[de jure]]'' 5th Bt (b.1658 d. 1723) founded and created the [[library]] belonging to the church. Many of these books now reside at the [[University of Cambridge]] for historical preservation.<ref name=\"A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 8\">{{cite book |last1=Baggs |first1=A P |last2=Keeling |first2=S M |last3=Meetings |first3=C A F |title=A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 8 |date=1982 |publisher=Victoria County House |page=49-54 |edition=1st |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/cambs/vol8 |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File: Kneesworth Hall, Ancestral Seat for the Nightingale Baronets.jpg|420px|thumb|left|Kneesworth Hall, Bassingbourn cum Kneesworth, Cambridgeshire.]]\n\n[[File:Coat of Arms and Crest, Nightingale Baronets, Debretts (1835).jpg|280px|thumb|right|The Coat of Arms & Crest of the Nightingale Family, as cited in the ''Peerage and Baronetage'' published by [[Debretts]] (1835).
