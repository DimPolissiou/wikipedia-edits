He served as head coach of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford Cardinal]], during which time he popularized the [[West Coast offense]]. After retiring from the 49ers, Walsh worked as a sports broadcaster for several years and then returned as head coach at Stanford for three seasons.\n\nWalsh went 102\u201363\u20131 (wins-losses-ties) with the 49ers, winning 10 of his 14 postseason games along with six division titles, three [[NFC Championship Game|NFC Championship]] titles, and three [[Super Bowls]]. He was named NFL Coach of the Year in 1981 and 1984. In 1993, he was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Los Angeles]], Walsh played running back in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] for [[Hayward High School]] in [[Hayward, California|Hayward]].<ref name=\"semtyh\">{{cite web | url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/30/BAG57LR8OK21.DTL | title=Former 49er head coach Bill Walsh dies | first=Tom | last=Fitzgerald | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=July 30, 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112203709/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2007%2F07%2F30%2FBAG57LR8OK21.DTL | archivedate=November 12, 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\nWalsh played [[quarterback]] at the [[College of San Mateo]] for two seasons.

After playing at the College of San Mateo, Walsh transferred to [[San Jos\u00e9 State University]], where he played [[tight end]] and [[defensive end]]. He also participated in intercollegiate [[boxing]], winning the golden glove.\n\nWalsh graduated from San Jose State with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[physical education]] in 1955.

Levy and Walsh, two future NFL Hall of Famers, would never produce a winning season at [[California Golden Bears football|Cal]].\n\nAfter coaching at Cal, Walsh did a stint at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] as an assistant coach, before beginning his pro coaching career.\n\n==Early professional coaching career==\nWalsh began his pro coaching career in [[1966 AFL season|1966]] as an assistant with the [[American Football League|AFL]]'s [[Oakland Raiders]]. As a Raider assistant, Walsh was trained in the vertical passing offense favored by [[Al Davis]], putting Walsh in Davis's mentor [[Sid Gillman#Coaching tree|Sid Gillman's coaching tree]].\n\nIn 1967 Walsh was the head coach and general manager of the [[San Jose Apaches]] of the [[Continental Football League]] (CFL). Walsh led the Apaches to 2nd place in the Pacific Division. Prior to the start of the 1968 CFL season the Apaches ceased all football operations.\n\nIn [[1968 AFL season|1968]], Walsh moved to the AFL expansion [[Cincinnati Bengals]], joining the staff of legendary coach [[Paul Brown]]. It was there that Walsh developed the philosophy now known as the \"West Coast Offense\", as a matter of necessity. Cincinnati's new [[quarterback]], [[Virgil Carter]], was known for his great mobility and accuracy but lacked a strong arm necessary to throw deep passes. Thus, Walsh modified the vertical passing scheme he had learned during his time with the Raiders, designing a horizontal passing system that relied on quick, short throws, often spreading the ball across the entire width of the field.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.milehighreport.com/2009/5/27/886729/bill-walsh-bill-parcells-and-the | title=Bill Walsh, Bill Parcells and the Rise of the Left Tackle | publisher=MileHighReport.com | date=May 27, 2009 | author=Doc Bear}}</ref>  The new offense was much better suited to Carter's physical abilities; he led the league in pass completion percentage in 1971.\n\nWalsh spent eight seasons as an assistant with the Bengals. [[Ken Anderson (quarterback)|Ken Anderson]] eventually replaced Carter as starting quarterback, and together with star [[wide receiver]] [[Isaac Curtis]], produced a consistent, effective offensive attack. Initially, Walsh started out as the wide receivers coach from 1968 to 1970 before also coaching the quarterbacks from 1971 to 1975.\n\nWhen Brown retired as head coach following the [[1975 NFL season|1975]] season and appointed [[Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson]] as his successor, Walsh resigned and served as an assistant coach for [[Tommy Prothro]] with the [[San Diego Chargers]] in [[1976 NFL season|1976]]. In a 2006 interview,<ref>{{cite news | author=Sam Farmer | title=Living Legend | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=December 22, 2006 | page=D1}}</ref> Walsh claimed that during his tenure with the Bengals, Brown \"worked against my candidacy\" to be a head coach anywhere in the league. \"All the way through I had opportunities, and I never knew about them,\" Walsh said. \"And then when I left him, he called whoever he thought was necessary to keep me out of the NFL.\"\n\nIn 1977, Walsh was hired as the head coach at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] where he stayed for two seasons. His two Stanford teams were successful, posting a 9\u20133 record in 1977 with a win in the [[1977 Sun Bowl (December)|Sun Bowl]], and 8\u20134 in 1978 with a win in the [[1978 Bluebonnet Bowl|Bluebonnet Bowl]]. His notable players at Stanford included quarterbacks [[Guy Benjamin]] and [[Steve Dils]], wide receivers [[James Lofton]] and [[Ken Margerum]], linebacker [[Gordy Ceresino]], in addition to running back [[Darrin Nelson]]. Walsh was the [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-8 Conference]] Coach of the Year in 1977.\n\n==49ers head coach==\nIn [[1979 NFL season|1979]], Walsh was hired as head coach of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] by owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Jr.]] The long-suffering 49ers went 2\u201314 in [[1978 NFL Season|1978]], the season before Walsh's arrival and repeated the same dismal record in his first season. But, Walsh got the entire organization to buy into his philosophy and vowed to turn around a miserable situation. He also drafted quarterback [[Joe Montana]] from [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] in the third round. Despite their second consecutive 2\u201314 record, the 49ers were playing more competitive football.\n\nIn [[1980 NFL Season|1980]], [[Steve DeBerg]] was the starting quarterback who got San Francisco off to a 3\u20130 start, but after a 59-14 blowout loss to Dallas in week 6, Walsh promoted Montana to starting QB. In a Sunday game, December 7 vs. the New Orleans Saints, Montana brought the 49ers back from a 35-7 halftime deficit to win 38\u201335 in overtime. The 49ers improved to 6\u201310, but more importantly, Walsh had them making great strides and they were getting better every week.\n\n===1981 championship===\nIn [[1981 NFL season|1981]], key victories were two wins each over the [[Los Angeles Rams]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The Rams were only two seasons removed from a [[Super Bowl XIV|Super Bowl]] appearance, and had dominated the series with the 49ers since 1967 winning 23, losing 3 and tying 1. San Francisco's two wins over the Rams in 1981 marked the shift of dominance in favor of the 49ers that lasted until 1998 with 30 wins (including 17 consecutively) against only 6 defeats. The 49ers blew out the Cowboys in week 6 of the regular season. On ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' that week, the win was not included in the halftime highlights. Walsh felt that this was because the Cowboys were scheduled to play the Rams the next week in a Sunday night game and that showing the highlights of the 49ers' win would potentially hurt the game's ratings. However, Walsh used this as a motivating factor for his team, who felt they were disrespected.<ref>{{cite book | author=Bill Walsh | title=The Score Takes Care of Itself: My Philosophy of Leadership | publisher=[[Penguin Group]] | year=2009 | page=169}}</ref> The 49ers finished the regular season with a 13\u20133 record.\n\nThe 49ers faced the Cowboys again that same season in the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] title game. The game was very close, and in the fourth quarter Walsh called a series of running plays as the 49ers marched down the field against the Cowboys' prevent defense, which had been expecting the 49ers to mainly pass. The 49ers came from behind to win the game on Dwight Clark's touchdown reception, known as [[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]], propelling Walsh to his first Super Bowl. Walsh would later write that the 49ers' two wins over the Rams showed a shift of power in their division, while the wins over the Cowboys showed a shift of power in the conference.\n\nSan Francisco won its first championship a year removed from back-to-back two-win seasons. The 49ers won [[Super Bowl XVI]] defeating the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] 26\u201321 in [[Pontiac, Michigan]].  Under Walsh the team rose from the cellar to the top of the NFL in just two seasons.\n\nThe 49ers won [[Super Bowl]] championships in [[1981 NFL season|1981]], [[1984 NFL season|1984]] and [[1988 NFL season|1988 seasons]]. Walsh served as 49ers head coach for 10 years, and during his tenure he and his coaching staff perfected the style of play known popularly as the [[West Coast offense]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/sports/football/31walsh.html|title=Bill Walsh, Innovator of West Coast Offense, Dies at 75.|last=Goldstein|first=Richard|date=July 31, 2007|work=New York Times|access-date=January 31, 2018}}</ref> Walsh was nicknamed \"The Genius\" for both his innovative play calling and design. Walsh would regularly script the first 10-15 offensive plays before the start of each game. In the ten years during which Walsh was the 49ers' head coach, San Francisco scored 3,714 points (24.4 per game), the most of any team in the league during that span.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pfref.com/tiny/XECxX|title=Pro-Football-Reference.com: In multiple seasons, from 1979 to 1988, in the Regular Season, requiring Underdog By >= 0, sorted by descending Points For.|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to [[Joe Montana]], Walsh drafted [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Charles Haley]], and [[Jerry Rice]]. He also traded a 2nd and 4th round pick in the 1987 draft for [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]]. His success with the 49ers was rewarded with his election to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Professional Football Hall of Fame]] in 1993.  Montana, Lott, Haley, Rice and Young were also elected to the Hall of Fame.\n\n==Coaching tree==\n===Prominent assistant coaches===\nMany of Bill Walsh's assistant coaches went on to be head coaches themselves, including [[George Seifert]], [[Mike Holmgren]], [[Ray Rhodes]], and [[Dennis Green]]. After Walsh's retirement from the 49ers, Seifert succeeded him as 49ers head coach, and guided San Francisco to victories in [[Super Bowl XXIV]] and [[Super Bowl XXIX]]. Holmgren won a [[Super Bowl XXXI|Super Bowl]] with the [[Green Bay Packers]], and made 3 Super Bowl appearances as a head coach: 2 with the Packers, and another with the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. These coaches in turn have their own disciples who have used Walsh's West Coast system, such as former [[Denver Broncos]] head coach [[Mike Shanahan]] and former [[Houston Texans]] head coach [[Gary Kubiak]]. Mike Shanahan was an offensive coordinator under [[George Seifert]] and went on to win [[Super Bowl XXXII]] and [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] during his time as head coach of the [[Denver Broncos]]. Kubiak was first a [[quarterback]] coach with the 49ers, and then [[offensive coordinator]] for Shanahan with the Broncos. In 2015, he became the Broncos' head coach and led Denver to victory in [[Super Bowl 50]]. [[Dennis Green]] trained [[Tony Dungy]], who won a [[Super Bowl XLI|Super Bowl]] with the [[Indianapolis Colts]], and [[Brian Billick]] with his brother-in law and linebackers coach [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]]. Billick won a [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl]] as head coach of the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. \n\nMike Holmgren trained many of his assistants to become head coaches, including [[Jon Gruden]] and [[Andy Reid]]. Gruden won a [[Super Bowl XXXVII|Super Bowl]] with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Reid served as head coach of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] from 1999\u20132012, and guided the Eagles to multiple winning seasons and numerous playoff appearances. Ever since 2013, Reid has served as head coach of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. He was finally able to win a Super Bowl, when his Chiefs defeated the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in [[Super Bowl LIV]]. In addition to this, [[Marc Trestman]], former head coach of the [[Chicago Bears]], served as Offensive Coordinator under Seifert in the 90's. Gruden himself would train [[Mike Tomlin]], who led the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] to their [[Super Bowl XLIII|sixth Super Bowl championship]], and [[Jim Harbaugh]], whose 49ers would face his brother, [[John Harbaugh]], whom Reid himself trained, and the [[Baltimore Ravens]] at [[Super Bowl XLVII]], which marked the Ravens' second World Championship.\n\nBill Walsh was viewed as a strong advocate for African-American head coaches in the NFL and NCAA.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives2001/features_2001/dickey_011402.asp | title=It's past time | author=Glenn Dickey | publisher=ProFootballWeekly.com | date=January 14, 2002 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121164442/http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives2001/features_2001/dickey_011402.asp | archivedate=November 21, 2006 }}</ref> Thus, the impact of Walsh also changed the NFL into an equal opportunity for African-American coaches. Along with [[Ray Rhodes]] and [[Dennis Green]], [[Tyrone Willingham]] became the head coach at Stanford, then later [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] and Washington. One of [[Mike Shanahan]]'s assistants, [[Karl Dorrell]] went on to be the head coach at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Walsh directly helped propel Dennis Green into the NFL head coaching ranks by offering to take on the head coaching job at Stanford.\n\n===Bill Walsh coaching tree===\nMany former and current NFL head coaches trace their lineage back to Bill Walsh on his [[coaching tree]], shown below.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/s/westcoast/history.html | title=An offense by any other name ... | author=Len Pasquarelli | publisher=ESPN.com | accessdate=March 12, 2009}}</ref> Walsh, in turn, belonged to the coaching tree of [[American Football League]] great and Hall of Fame coach [[Sid Gillman]] of the AFL's [[San Diego Chargers|Los Angeles/San Diego Chargers]] and Hall of Fame coach [[Paul Brown]].\n[[File:Bill Walsh Coaching Tree.svg|center]]\n\n==Later career==\nAfter leaving the coaching ranks immediately following his team's victory in [[Super Bowl XXIII]], Walsh went to work as a broadcaster for [[NFL on NBC|NBC]], teaming with [[Dick Enberg]] to form the lead broadcasting team, replacing [[Merlin Olsen]].\n\nDuring his time with NBC, rumors began to surface that Walsh would coach again in the NFL.  There were at least two known instances.\n\nFirst, according to a February 2015 article by [[Mike Florio]] of NBC Sports,  [[1989 New England Patriots season|after a 5\u201311 season in 1989, the Patriots]] fired Raymond Berry and unsuccessfully attempted to lure Walsh to Foxborough to become head coach and general manager.  When that failed, New England promoted defensive coordinator Rod Rust; the team [[1990 New England Patriots season|split its first two games and then lost 14 straight in 1990]].<ref>https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/02/26/recalling-the-raymond-berry-era-and-new-englands-failed-run-at-bill-walsh/</ref>\n\nSecond, late in the 1990 season, Walsh was rumored to become [[1990 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay's]] next head coach and general manager after the team fired [[Ray Perkins]] and promoted [[Richard Williamson (American football)|Richard Williamson]] on an interim basis.  Part of the speculation was fueled by the fact that Walsh's contract with NBC, which ran for 1989 and 1990, would soon be up for renewal, to say nothing of the pressure [[Hugh Culverhouse]] faced to increase fan support and to fill the seats at [[Tampa Stadium]].  However, less than a week after [[Super Bowl XXV]], Walsh not only declined Tampa Bay's offer, but he and NBC agreed on a contract extension.  Walsh would continue in his role with NBC for 1991.  Meanwhile, after unsuccessfully courting then-recently fired Eagles coach [[Buddy Ryan]] or Giants then-defensive coordinator [[Bill Belichick]] to man the sidelines for Tampa Bay in 1991, the Bucs stuck with Williamson.  Under Williamson's leadership, [[1991 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay won only three games in 1991]].<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-01-31-9101090974-story.html</ref>\n\nWalsh did return to Stanford as head coach in 1992, leading the Cardinal to a 10\u20133 record and a [[Pacific-10 Conference]] co-championship. Stanford finished the season with an upset victory over [[Penn State]] in the [[1993 Blockbuster Bowl|Blockbuster Bowl]] on January 1, 1993 and a #9 ranking in the final [[AP Poll]]. In 1994, after consecutive losing seasons, Walsh left Stanford and retired from coaching.\n\nIn 1996 Walsh returned to the 49ers as an administrative aide <ref>{{cite web|title=Adding Walsh to the 49ers Could Stir up Trouble|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-24/sports/sp-28018_1_bill-walsh|website=LA Times}}</ref> Walsh was the Vice President and General Manager for the 49ers from [[1999 San Francisco 49ers season|1999]] to [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|2001]] and was a special consultant to the team for three years afterwards.\n\nIn 2004, Walsh was appointed as special assistant to the athletic director at Stanford. In 2005, after then-athletic director Ted Leland stepped down, Walsh was named interim athletic director. He also acted as a consultant for his alma mater [[San Jose State University]] in their search for an Athletic Director and Head Football Coach in 2005.\n\nWalsh was also the author of three books, a motivational speaker, and taught classes at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]].\n\nWalsh was a Board Member for the [[Lott Trophy|Lott IMPACT Trophy]], which is named after [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] defensive back [[Ronnie Lott]], and is awarded annually to college football's Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year.

Levy and Walsh, two future NFL Hall of Famers, would never produce a winning season at [[California Golden Bears football|Cal]].\n\nAfter coaching at Cal, Walsh did a stint at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] as an assistant coach, before beginning his pro coaching career.\n\n==Early professional coaching career==\nWalsh began his pro coaching career in [[1966 AFL season|1966]] as an assistant with the [[American Football League|AFL]]'s [[Oakland Raiders]]. As a Raider assistant, Walsh was trained in the vertical passing offense favored by [[Al Davis]], putting Walsh in Davis's mentor [[Sid Gillman#Coaching tree|Sid Gillman's coaching tree]].\n\nIn 1967 Walsh was the head coach and general manager of the [[San Jose Apaches]] of the [[Continental Football League]] (CFL). Walsh led the Apaches to 2nd place in the Pacific Division. Prior to the start of the 1968 CFL season the Apaches ceased all football operations.\n\nIn [[1968 AFL season|1968]], Walsh moved to the AFL expansion [[Cincinnati Bengals]], joining the staff of legendary coach [[Paul Brown]]. It was there that Walsh developed the philosophy now known as the \"West Coast Offense\", as a matter of necessity. Cincinnati's new [[quarterback]], [[Virgil Carter]], was known for his great mobility and accuracy but lacked a strong arm necessary to throw deep passes. Thus, Walsh modified the vertical passing scheme he had learned during his time with the Raiders, designing a horizontal passing system that relied on quick, short throws, often spreading the ball across the entire width of the field.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.milehighreport.com/2009/5/27/886729/bill-walsh-bill-parcells-and-the | title=Bill Walsh, Bill Parcells and the Rise of the Left Tackle | publisher=MileHighReport.com | date=May 27, 2009 | author=Doc Bear}}</ref>  The new offense was much better suited to Carter's physical abilities; he led the league in pass completion percentage in 1971.\n\nWalsh spent eight seasons as an assistant with the Bengals. [[Ken Anderson (quarterback)|Ken Anderson]] eventually replaced Carter as starting quarterback, and together with star [[wide receiver]] [[Isaac Curtis]], produced a consistent, effective offensive attack. Initially, Walsh started out as the wide receivers coach from 1968 to 1970 before also coaching the quarterbacks from 1971 to 1975.\n\nWhen Brown retired as head coach following the [[1975 NFL season|1975]] season and appointed [[Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson]] as his successor, Walsh resigned and served as an assistant coach for [[Tommy Prothro]] with the [[San Diego Chargers]] in [[1976 NFL season|1976]]. In a 2006 interview,<ref>{{cite news | author=Sam Farmer | title=Living Legend | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=December 22, 2006 | page=D1}}</ref> Walsh claimed that during his tenure with the Bengals, Brown \"worked against my candidacy\" to be a head coach anywhere in the league. \"All the way through I had opportunities, and I never knew about them,\" Walsh said. \"And then when I left him, he called whoever he thought was necessary to keep me out of the NFL.\"\n\nIn 1977, Walsh was hired as the head coach at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] where he stayed for two seasons. His two Stanford teams were successful, posting a 9\u20133 record in 1977 with a win in the [[1977 Sun Bowl (December)|Sun Bowl]], and 8\u20134 in 1978 with a win in the [[1978 Bluebonnet Bowl|Bluebonnet Bowl]]. His notable players at Stanford included quarterbacks [[Guy Benjamin]] and [[Steve Dils]], wide receivers [[James Lofton]] and [[Ken Margerum]], linebacker [[Gordy Ceresino]], in addition to running back [[Darrin Nelson]]. Walsh was the [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-8 Conference]] Coach of the Year in 1977.\n\n==49ers head coach==\nIn [[1979 NFL season|1979]], Walsh was hired as head coach of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] by owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Jr.]] The long-suffering 49ers went 2\u201314 in [[1978 NFL Season|1978]], the season before Walsh's arrival and repeated the same dismal record in his first season. But, Walsh got the entire organization to buy into his philosophy and vowed to turn around a miserable situation. He also drafted quarterback [[Joe Montana]] from [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] in the third round. Despite their second consecutive 2\u201314 record, the 49ers were playing more competitive football.\n\nIn [[1980 NFL Season|1980]], [[Steve DeBerg]] was the starting quarterback who got San Francisco off to a 3\u20130 start, but after a 59-14 blowout loss to Dallas in week 6, Walsh promoted Montana to starting QB. In a Sunday game, December 7 vs. the New Orleans Saints, Montana brought the 49ers back from a 35-7 halftime deficit to win 38\u201335 in overtime. The 49ers improved to 6\u201310, but more importantly, Walsh had them making great strides and they were getting better every week.\n\n===1981 championship===\nIn [[1981 NFL season|1981]], key victories were two wins each over the [[Los Angeles Rams]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The Rams were only two seasons removed from a [[Super Bowl XIV|Super Bowl]] appearance, and had dominated the series with the 49ers since 1967 winning 23, losing 3 and tying 1. San Francisco's two wins over the Rams in 1981 marked the shift of dominance in favor of the 49ers that lasted until 1998 with 30 wins (including 17 consecutively) against only 6 defeats. The 49ers blew out the Cowboys in week 6 of the regular season. On ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' that week, the win was not included in the halftime highlights. Walsh felt that this was because the Cowboys were scheduled to play the Rams the next week in a Sunday night game and that showing the highlights of the 49ers' win would potentially hurt the game's ratings. However, Walsh used this as a motivating factor for his team, who felt they were disrespected.<ref>{{cite book | author=Bill Walsh | title=The Score Takes Care of Itself: My Philosophy of Leadership | publisher=[[Penguin Group]] | year=2009 | page=169}}</ref> The 49ers finished the regular season with a 13\u20133 record.\n\nThe 49ers faced the Cowboys again that same season in the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] title game. The game was very close, and in the fourth quarter Walsh called a series of running plays as the 49ers marched down the field against the Cowboys' prevent defense, which had been expecting the 49ers to mainly pass. The 49ers came from behind to win the game on Dwight Clark's touchdown reception, known as [[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]], propelling Walsh to his first Super Bowl. Walsh would later write that the 49ers' two wins over the Rams showed a shift of power in their division, while the wins over the Cowboys showed a shift of power in the conference.\n\nSan Francisco won its first championship a year removed from back-to-back two-win seasons. The 49ers won [[Super Bowl XVI]] defeating the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] 26\u201321 in [[Pontiac, Michigan]].  Under Walsh the team rose from the cellar to the top of the NFL in just two seasons.\n\nThe 49ers won [[Super Bowl]] championships in [[1981 NFL season|1981]], [[1984 NFL season|1984]] and [[1988 NFL season|1988 seasons]]. Walsh served as 49ers head coach for 10 years, and during his tenure he and his coaching staff perfected the style of play known popularly as the [[West Coast offense]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/sports/football/31walsh.html|title=Bill Walsh, Innovator of West Coast Offense, Dies at 75.|last=Goldstein|first=Richard|date=July 31, 2007|work=New York Times|access-date=January 31, 2018}}</ref> Walsh was nicknamed \"The Genius\" for both his innovative play calling and design. Walsh would regularly script the first 10-15 offensive plays before the start of each game. In the ten years during which Walsh was the 49ers' head coach, San Francisco scored 3,714 points (24.4 per game), the most of any team in the league during that span.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pfref.com/tiny/XECxX|title=Pro-Football-Reference.com: In multiple seasons, from 1979 to 1988, in the Regular Season, requiring Underdog By >= 0, sorted by descending Points For.|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to [[Joe Montana]], Walsh drafted [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Charles Haley]], and [[Jerry Rice]]. He also traded a 2nd and 4th round pick in the 1987 draft for [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]]. His success with the 49ers was rewarded with his election to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Professional Football Hall of Fame]] in 1993.  Montana, Lott, Haley, Rice and Young were also elected to the Hall of Fame.\n\n==Coaching tree==\n===Prominent assistant coaches===\nMany of Bill Walsh's assistant coaches went on to be head coaches themselves, including [[George Seifert]], [[Mike Holmgren]], [[Ray Rhodes]], and [[Dennis Green]]. After Walsh's retirement from the 49ers, Seifert succeeded him as 49ers head coach, and guided San Francisco to victories in [[Super Bowl XXIV]] and [[Super Bowl XXIX]]. Holmgren won a [[Super Bowl XXXI|Super Bowl]] with the [[Green Bay Packers]], and made 3 Super Bowl appearances as a head coach: 2 with the Packers, and another with the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. These coaches in turn have their own disciples who have used Walsh's West Coast system, such as former [[Denver Broncos]] head coach [[Mike Shanahan]] and former [[Houston Texans]] head coach [[Gary Kubiak]]. Mike Shanahan was an offensive coordinator under [[George Seifert]] and went on to win [[Super Bowl XXXII]] and [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] during his time as head coach of the [[Denver Broncos]]. Kubiak was first a [[quarterback]] coach with the 49ers, and then [[offensive coordinator]] for Shanahan with the Broncos. In 2015, he became the Broncos' head coach and led Denver to victory in [[Super Bowl 50]]. [[Dennis Green]] trained [[Tony Dungy]], who won a [[Super Bowl XLI|Super Bowl]] with the [[Indianapolis Colts]], and [[Brian Billick]] with his brother-in law and linebackers coach [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]]. Billick won a [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl]] as head coach of the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. Mike Holmgren trained many of his assistants to become head coaches, including [[Jon Gruden]] and [[Andy Reid]]. Gruden won a [[Super Bowl XXXVII|Super Bowl]] with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Reid served as head coach of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] from 1999\u20132012, and guided the Eagles to multiple winning seasons and numerous playoff appearances. Ever since 2013, Reid has served as head coach of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. He was finally able to win a Super Bowl, when his Chiefs defeated the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in [[Super Bowl LIV]]. In addition to this, [[Marc Trestman]], former head coach of the [[Chicago Bears]], served as Offensive Coordinator under Seifert in the 90's. Gruden himself would train [[Mike Tomlin]], who led the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] to their [[Super Bowl XLIII|sixth Super Bowl championship]], and [[Jim Harbaugh]], whose 49ers would face his brother, [[John Harbaugh]], whom Reid himself trained, and the [[Baltimore Ravens]] at [[Super Bowl XLVII]], which marked the Ravens' second World Championship.\n\nBill Walsh was viewed as a strong advocate for African-American head coaches in the NFL and NCAA.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives2001/features_2001/dickey_011402.asp | title=It's past time | author=Glenn Dickey | publisher=ProFootballWeekly.com | date=January 14, 2002 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121164442/http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives2001/features_2001/dickey_011402.asp | archivedate=November 21, 2006 }}</ref> Thus, the impact of Walsh also changed the NFL into an equal opportunity for African-American coaches. Along with [[Ray Rhodes]] and [[Dennis Green]], [[Tyrone Willingham]] became the head coach at Stanford, then later [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] and Washington. One of [[Mike Shanahan]]'s assistants, [[Karl Dorrell]] went on to be the head coach at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Walsh directly helped propel Dennis Green into the NFL head coaching ranks by offering to take on the head coaching job at Stanford.\n\n===Bill Walsh coaching tree===\nMany former and current NFL head coaches trace their lineage back to Bill Walsh on his [[coaching tree]], shown below.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/s/westcoast/history.html | title=An offense by any other name ... | author=Len Pasquarelli | publisher=ESPN.com | accessdate=March 12, 2009}}</ref> Walsh, in turn, belonged to the coaching tree of [[American Football League]] great and Hall of Fame coach [[Sid Gillman]] of the AFL's [[San Diego Chargers|Los Angeles/San Diego Chargers]] and Hall of Fame coach [[Paul Brown]].\n[[File:Bill Walsh Coaching Tree.svg|center]]\n\n==Later career==\nAfter leaving the coaching ranks immediately following his team's victory in [[Super Bowl XXIII]], Walsh went to work as a broadcaster for [[NFL on NBC|NBC]], teaming with [[Dick Enberg]] to form the lead broadcasting team, replacing [[Merlin Olsen]].\n\nDuring his time with NBC, rumors began to surface that Walsh would coach again in the NFL.  There were at least two known instances.\n\nFirst, according to a February 2015 article by [[Mike Florio]] of NBC Sports,  [[1989 New England Patriots season|after a 5\u201311 season in 1989, the Patriots]] fired Raymond Berry and unsuccessfully attempted to lure Walsh to Foxborough to become head coach and general manager.  When that failed, New England promoted defensive coordinator Rod Rust; the team [[1990 New England Patriots season|split its first two games and then lost 14 straight in 1990]].<ref>https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/02/26/recalling-the-raymond-berry-era-and-new-englands-failed-run-at-bill-walsh/</ref>\n\nSecond, late in the 1990 season, Walsh was rumored to become [[1990 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay's]] next head coach and general manager after the team fired [[Ray Perkins]] and promoted [[Richard Williamson (American football)|Richard Williamson]] on an interim basis.  Part of the speculation was fueled by the fact that Walsh's contract with NBC, which ran for 1989 and 1990, would soon be up for renewal, to say nothing of the pressure [[Hugh Culverhouse]] faced to increase fan support and to fill the seats at [[Tampa Stadium]].  However, less than a week after [[Super Bowl XXV]], Walsh not only declined Tampa Bay's offer, but he and NBC agreed on a contract extension.  Walsh would continue in his role with NBC for 1991.  Meanwhile, after unsuccessfully courting then-recently fired Eagles coach [[Buddy Ryan]] or Giants then-defensive coordinator [[Bill Belichick]] to man the sidelines for Tampa Bay in 1991, the Bucs stuck with Williamson.  Under Williamson's leadership, [[1991 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay won only three games in 1991]].<ref>https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-01-31-9101090974-story.html</ref>\n\nWalsh did return to Stanford as head coach in 1992, leading the Cardinal to a 10\u20133 record and a [[Pacific-10 Conference]] co-championship. Stanford finished the season with an upset victory over [[Penn State]] in the [[1993 Blockbuster Bowl|Blockbuster Bowl]] on January 1, 1993 and a #9 ranking in the final [[AP Poll]]. In 1994, after consecutive losing seasons, Walsh left Stanford and retired from coaching.\n\nIn 1996 Walsh returned to the 49ers as an administrative aide <ref>{{cite web|title=Adding Walsh to the 49ers Could Stir up Trouble|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-24/sports/sp-28018_1_bill-walsh|website=LA Times}}</ref> Walsh was the Vice President and General Manager for the 49ers from [[1999 San Francisco 49ers season|1999]] to [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|2001]] and was a special consultant to the team for three years afterwards.\n\nIn 2004, Walsh was appointed as special assistant to the athletic director at Stanford. In 2005, after then-athletic director Ted Leland stepped down, Walsh was named interim athletic director. He also acted as a consultant for his alma mater [[San Jose State University]] in their search for an Athletic Director and Head Football Coach in 2005.\n\nWalsh was also the author of three books, a motivational speaker, and taught classes at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]].\n\nWalsh was a Board Member for the [[Lott Trophy|Lott IMPACT Trophy]], which is named after [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] defensive back [[Ronnie Lott]], and is awarded annually to college football's Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year. Walsh served as a keynote speaker at the award's banquet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lottimpacttrophy.com/news/article/-you-are-looking-live-at- |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527051520/http://www.lottimpacttrophy.com/news/article/-you-are-looking-live-at- |archivedate=May 27, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nBill Walsh died of leukemia on July 30, 2007 at his home in [[Woodside, California]].<ref name=\"semtyh\"/>\n\nFollowing Walsh's death, the playing field at the former [[Candlestick Park]] was renamed \"Bill Walsh Field\".<ref name=\"Bill Walsh Field\">{{cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2969252 | title=49ers home field to be named after Walsh | date=August 10, 2007 | publisher=[[ESPN]] | accessdate=November 11, 2007}}</ref> Additionally, the regular [[San Jose State Spartans football|San Jose State]] versus Stanford football game was renamed the \"[[Bill Walsh Legacy Game]]\".<ref name=\"Bill Walsh Legacy Game\">{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/12/SPOBS3G79.DTL&type=sports | title=Walsh's legacy all over this game | newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle | author=Michelle Smith | date=September 12, 2007 | accessdate=November 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nWalsh is survived by his wife Geri, his son Craig and his daughter Elizabeth.

Sometime in the 1930s they moved to Birkenallee, where they remained until the end of World War II in 1945. Between 1945 and '55 their home ground was the Sportplatz Poststra\u00dfe, and after 1955 the Stadion an der Poststra\u00dfe. After capturing the Amateuroberliga Westfalen title in 1991, the team played its promotion round matches in the Heidewaldestadion G\u00fctersloh in its failed attempt to advance to the [[2. Bundesliga]] (as the Poststra\u00dfe was not up to the task both capacity- and security-wise). The Stadion an der Poststra\u00dfe was last expanded in 2015-16 to a capacity of 5,153, and renamed \"Sportclub-Arena\".\n\n==Rivalries==\nSC Verl followers share a heartfelt rivalry with nearby [[FC G\u00fctersloh]] whose supporters look down on the \"village club\", while SCV supporters in their turn tease the \"big city club\" over its inconsistent performance and financial woes.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n<!--\n1970-71\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t3rd\n1971-72\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t6th\n1972-73\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t3rd\n1973-74\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t3rd\n1974-75\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t7th\n1975-76\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t7th\n1976-77\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t7th\n1977\u201378\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t2nd \u2191\n1978\u201379\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t4th\n1979\u201380\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t5th\n1980\u201381\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t2nd\n1981\u201382\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t8th\n1982\u201383\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t4th\n1983\u201384\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t4th\n1984\u201385\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t2nd\n1985\u201386\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t1st \u2191\n1986\u201387\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t9th\n1987\u201388\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t13th\n1988\u201389\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t7th\n1989\u201390\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t6th\n1990\u201391\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t1st\n1991\u201392\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t3rd\n1992\u201393\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t2nd\n1993\u201394\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t5th\n1994\u201395\t(III)\tRegionalliga West/SW\t\t2nd\n1995\u201396\t(III)\tRegionalliga West/SW\t\t10th\n1996\u201397\t(III)\tRegionalliga West/SW\t\t7th\n1997\u201398\t(III)\tRegionalliga West/SW\t\t10th\n1998\u201399\t(III)\tRegionalliga West/SW\t\t10th\n1999-00\t(III)\tRegionalliga West/SW\t\t9th\n2000\u201301\t(III)\tRegionalliga Nord\t\t6th\n2001\u201302\t(III)\tRegionalliga Nord\t\t11th\n2002\u201303\t(III)\tRegionalliga Nord\t\t15th \u2193\n2003\u201304\t(IV)\tOberliga Westfalen\t\t2nd\n2004\u201305\t(IV)\tOberliga Westfalen\t\t5th\n2005\u201306\t(IV)\tOberliga Westfalen\t\t2nd\n2006\u201307\t(IV)\tOberliga Westfalen\t\t1st \u2191\n2007\u201308\t(III)\tRegionalliga Nord\t\t18th\t\t\n2008\u201309 (IV) Regionalliga West\t\t8th\n2009\u201310 (IV) Regionalliga West 9th\n2010\u201311 (IV) Regionalliga West 9th\n2011\u201312 (IV) Regionalliga West 10th\n-->\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|SC Verl}}\n* [http://www.scverl.de/ Official website] {{in lang|de}}\n* [http://www.f-archiv.de/ Das deutsche Fu\u00dfball-Archiv] historical German domestic league tables {{in lang|de}}\n* [http://www.abseits-soccer.com/clubs/verl.html Abseits Guide to German Soccer]\n\n{{Regionalliga West}}\n\n{{coord|51|53|00|N|8|30|48|E|region:DE-NW_type:landmark_source:dewiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Verl, Sc}}\n[[Category:Football clubs in Germany]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1924]]\n[[Category:SC Verl| ]]\n[[Category:1924 establishments in Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n{{Infobox football club\n| clubname = SC Verl\n| image    = SC Verl logo.svg\n| image_size = 200\n| fullname = Sportclub Verl von 1924 e.V.\n| nickname = \n| founded  = 6 September 1924\n| ground   = Stadion an der Poststra\u00dfe\n| capacity = 5,001\n| chairman = Raimund Bertels\n| manager  = Guerino Capretti\n| league   = [[Regionalliga West]] (IV)\n| season   = [[2018\u201319 Regionalliga#Regionalliga West|2018\u201319]]\n| position = 7th\n| pattern_la1= | pattern_b1=_thinblacksides | pattern_ra1= | leftarm1=FFFFFF | body1=FFFFFF | rightarm1=FFFFFF | shorts1=FFFFFF | socks1=FFFFFF |\n  pattern_la2= | pattern_b2=_thinwhitesides | pattern_ra2= | leftarm2=000000 | body2=000000 | rightarm2=000000 | shorts2=000000 | socks2=000000 |\n}}\n\n'''SC Verl''' is a [[Football in Germany|German association football club]] based in [[Verl]], North Rhine-Westphalia.

Sometime in the 1930s they moved to Birkenallee, where they remained until the end of World War II in 1945. Between 1945 and '55 their home ground was the Sportplatz Poststra\u00dfe, and after 1955 the Stadion an der Poststra\u00dfe. After capturing the Amateuroberliga Westfalen title in 1991, the team played its promotion round matches in the Heidewaldestadion G\u00fctersloh in its failed attempt to advance to the [[2. Bundesliga]] (as the Poststra\u00dfe was not up to the task both capacity- and security-wise). The Stadion an der Poststra\u00dfe was last expanded in 2015-16 to a capacity of 5,153, and renamed \"Sportclub-Arena\".\n\n==Rivalries==\nSC Verl followers share a heartfelt rivalry with nearby [[FC G\u00fctersloh]] whose supporters look down on the \"village club\", while SCV supporters in their turn tease the \"big city club\" over its inconsistent performance and financial woes.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n<!--\n1970-71\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t3rd\n1971-72\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t6th\n1972-73\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t3rd\n1973-74\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t3rd\n1974-75\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t7th\n1975-76\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t7th\n1976-77\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t7th\n1977\u201378\t(V)\tLandesliga Westfalen-1\t\t2nd \u2191\n1978\u201379\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t4th\n1979\u201380\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t5th\n1980\u201381\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t2nd\n1981\u201382\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t8th\n1982\u201383\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t4th\n1983\u201384\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t4th\n1984\u201385\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t2nd\n1985\u201386\t(IV)\tVerbandsliga Westfalen-NO\t1st \u2191\n1986\u201387\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t9th\n1987\u201388\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t13th\n1988\u201389\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t7th\n1989\u201390\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t6th\n1990\u201391\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t1st\n1991\u201392\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t3rd\n1992\u201393\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t2nd\n1993\u201394\t(III)\tAm.Oberliga Westfalen\t\t5th\n1994\u201395\t(III)\tRegionalliga West/SW\t\t2nd\n1995\u201396\t(III)\tRegionalliga West/SW\t\t10th\n1996\u201397\t(III)\tRegionalliga West/SW\t\t7th\n1997\u201398\t(III)\tRegionalliga West/SW\t\t10th\n1998\u201399\t(III)\tRegionalliga West/SW\t\t10th\n1999-00\t(III)\tRegionalliga West/SW\t\t9th\n2000\u201301\t(III)\tRegionalliga Nord\t\t6th\n2001\u201302\t(III)\tRegionalliga Nord\t\t11th\n2002\u201303\t(III)\tRegionalliga Nord\t\t15th \u2193\n2003\u201304\t(IV)\tOberliga Westfalen\t\t2nd\n2004\u201305\t(IV)\tOberliga Westfalen\t\t5th\n2005\u201306\t(IV)\tOberliga Westfalen\t\t2nd\n2006\u201307\t(IV)\tOberliga Westfalen\t\t1st \u2191\n2007\u201308\t(III)\tRegionalliga Nord\t\t18th\t\t\n2008\u201309 (IV) Regionalliga West\t\t8th\n2009\u201310 (IV) Regionalliga West 9th\n2010\u201311 (IV) Regionalliga West 9th\n2011\u201312 (IV) Regionalliga West 10th\n-->\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|SC Verl}}\n* [http://www.scverl.de/ Official website] {{in lang|de}}\n* [http://www.f-archiv.de/ Das deutsche Fu\u00dfball-Archiv] historical German domestic league tables {{in lang|de}}\n* [http://www.abseits-soccer.com/clubs/verl.html Abseits Guide to German Soccer]\n\n{{Regionalliga West}}\n\n{{coord|51|53|00|N|8|30|48|E|region:DE-NW_type:landmark_source:dewiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Verl, Sc}}\n[[Category:Football clubs in Germany]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1924]]\n[[Category:SC Verl| ]]\n[[Category:1924 establishments in Germany]]\n", "name_user": "SFletcher06", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCurrent squad", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SC_Verl"}

In the tally, candidates were eliminated sequentially, with three candidates far ahead in first choices. After the count of first choices, Don Perata was in first place, Jean Quan in second place, and Rebecca Kaplan in third place. They remained in that order of votes after all other candidates were eliminated and their votes re-allocated. When Kaplan was then eliminated, Quan picked up 18,864 votes from Kaplan backers while Perata was the next choice of only 6,407 Kaplan backers. As a result, Quan won a final round majority when matched against Perata, which means she was ranked ahead of Perata on a majority of ballots in which one of them received a ranking.(11% of voters did not rank either of them, making their votes exhausted by the time of the final round.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acgov.org/rov/rcv/results/rcvresults_2984.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 11, 2011 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115182601/http://www.acgov.org/rov/rcv/results/rcvresults_2984.htm |archivedate=November 15, 2011 }}</ref>\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Candidate\n!colspan=3|Round 1\n!rowspan=2|\u2026\n!colspan=3|Round 9\n!colspan=2|Round 10\n|-\n!Votes||%<sup>(*)</sup>||Transfer||Votes||%<sup>(*)</sup>||Transfer||Votes||%<sup>(*)</sup>\n|-\n|[[Don Perata]]||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''40,342'''</span>||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''33.73%'''</span>||+32||||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''45,465'''</span>||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''40.16%'''</span>||+6,407||51,872||49.04%\n|-\n|'''[[Jean Quan]]'''||29,266||24.47%||+33||||35,033||30.94%||+18,864||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''53,897'''</span>||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''50.96%'''</span>\n|-\n|[[Rebecca Kaplan]]||25,813||21.58%||+18||||32,719||28.90%||-32,719||||\n|-\n|Joe Tuman||14,347||12.00%||+10||||||||||||\n|-\n|Marcie Hodge||2,994||2.50%||+5||||||||||||\n|-\n|Terence Candell||2,315||1.94%||+1||||||||||||\n|-\n|Don MacLeay||1,630||1.36%||+6||||||||||||\n|-\n|Greg Harland||966||0.81%||+2||||||||||||\n|-\n|Larry Lionel ''LL'' Young Jr.||933||0.78%||+6||||||||||||\n|-\n|Arnold Fields||733||0.61%||+5||||||||||||\n|-\n|Write-In||268||0.22%||-268||||||||||||\n|-\n|Continuing Ballots||119,607||100.00%||||||113,217||100.00%||||105,769||100.00%\n|-\n|Exhausted Ballots||0||||+149||||6,284||||+7,383||13,667|||\n|-\n|Overvotes||355||||+1||||461||||+65||526|||\n|-\n|Undervotes||2,306||||||||2,306||||||2,306|||\n|-\n|Total Ballots||122,268||||||||122,268||||||122,268|||\n|}\n\n=====2012 elections=====\nOakland used RCV for several elections in 2012, including a citywide election for city attorney and for several seats on the city council and school board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zennie62blog.com/2012/06/07/oakland-city-council-will-change-oaklanders-get-to-decide-how-dan-cohen-48125/ |title=Oakland City Council Will Change; Oaklanders Get To Decide How \u2013 Dan Cohen |website=Zennie62blog.com |date=2012-06-07 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}</ref> Several races were decided after multiple rounds, including the District 3 city council race where the winner trailed in first choices.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mollie |last=Hailey  |url=http://www.fairvote.org/fairvote-s-first-take-on-rcv-elections-in-four-bay-area-cities |title=FairVote's First Take on RCV Elections in Four Bay Area Cities |work=FairVote.org  |date=2012-11-12 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}</ref> Of the 18 Oakland offices elected by RCV in 2010 and 2012, sixteen of the RCV winners received more votes than the previous winner had won before adoption in the last non-RCV election <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fairvote.org/assets/Oakland-RCV-Analysis-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-06 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130106162800/http://www.fairvote.org/assets/Oakland-RCV-Analysis-2012.pdf |archive-date=2013-01-06 |url-status = bot: unknown}}</ref>\n\n====San Francisco====\n[[San Francisco]] has used RCV for its Board of Supervisors and most citywide offices nearly every November since 2004.

The winner won 54% of the final round count, which amounted to 48.67% of the total first-round votes, with 9.89% of the ballots exhausted by the final round.\n* District 5: There were 22 candidates, reduced to 3 in 19 rounds, when the winner had a majority of active ballots. The winner finished with 50.6% of the final round vote against two runners up, which amounted to 37.63% of the first-round vote with 25.63% of the ballots exhausted.\n* District 7: There were 13 candidates, reduced to 2 in 11 rounds. The winner finished with 57% of the votes cast for the two active candidates in the final round. Of first round votes, this amounted to 43.72% of the first-round vote, with 23.12% exhausted ballots.\n* District 11: There were 8 candidates, reduced to 2 in 6 rounds.

The elimination process was stable for the highest 5 candidates, holding their same plurality ranking each round despite the 19 rounds of elimination and transfer votes.\n\nThe RCV elimination process was halted when candidate Mirkarimi reached more than 50% of the active ballots, but only 37.6% of the total first-round ballots.

As a result, Quan won a final round majority when matched against Perata, which means she was ranked ahead of Perata on a majority of ballots in which one of them received a ranking.(11% of voters did not rank either of them, making their votes exhausted by the time of the final round.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acgov.org/rov/rcv/results/rcvresults_2984.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 11, 2011 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115182601/http://www.acgov.org/rov/rcv/results/rcvresults_2984.htm |archivedate=November 15, 2011 }}</ref>\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Candidate\n!colspan=3|Round 1\n!rowspan=2|\u2026\n!colspan=3|Round 9\n!colspan=2|Round 10\n|-\n!Votes||%<sup>(*)</sup>||Transfer||Votes||%<sup>(*)</sup>||Transfer||Votes||%<sup>(*)</sup>\n|-\n|[[Don Perata]]||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''40,342'''</span>||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''33.73%'''</span>||+32||||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''45,465'''</span>||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''40.16%'''</span>||+6,407||51,872||49.04%\n|-\n|'''[[Jean Quan]]'''||29,266||24.47%||+33||||35,033||30.94%||+18,864||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''53,897'''</span>||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''50.96%'''</span>\n|-\n|[[Rebecca Kaplan]]||25,813||21.58%||+18||||32,719||28.90%||-32,719||||\n|-\n|Joe Tuman||14,347||12.00%||+10||||||||||||\n|-\n|Marcie Hodge||2,994||2.50%||+5||||||||||||\n|-\n|Terence Candell||2,315||1.94%||+1||||||||||||\n|-\n|Don MacLeay||1,630||1.36%||+6||||||||||||\n|-\n|Greg Harland||966||0.81%||+2||||||||||||\n|-\n|Larry Lionel ''LL'' Young Jr.||933||0.78%||+6||||||||||||\n|-\n|Arnold Fields||733||0.61%||+5||||||||||||\n|-\n|Write-In||268||0.22%||-268||||||||||||\n|-\n|Continuing Ballots||119,607||100.00%||||||113,217||100.00%||||105,769||100.00%\n|-\n|Exhausted Ballots||0||||+149||||6,284||||+7,383||13,667|||\n|-\n|Overvotes||355||||+1||||461||||+65||526|||\n|-\n|Undervotes||2,306||||||||2,306||||||2,306|||\n|-\n|Total Ballots||122,268||||||||122,268||||||122,268|||\n|}\n\n=====2012 elections=====\nOakland used RCV for several elections in 2012, including a citywide election for city attorney and for several seats on the city council and school board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zennie62blog.com/2012/06/07/oakland-city-council-will-change-oaklanders-get-to-decide-how-dan-cohen-48125/ |title=Oakland City Council Will Change; Oaklanders Get To Decide How \u2013 Dan Cohen |website=Zennie62blog.com |date=2012-06-07 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}</ref> Several races were decided after multiple rounds, including the District 3 city council race where the winner trailed in first choices.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mollie |last=Hailey  |url=http://www.fairvote.org/fairvote-s-first-take-on-rcv-elections-in-four-bay-area-cities |title=FairVote's First Take on RCV Elections in Four Bay Area Cities |work=FairVote.org  |date=2012-11-12 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}</ref> Of the 18 Oakland offices elected by RCV in 2010 and 2012, sixteen of the RCV winners received more votes than the previous winner had won before adoption in the last non-RCV election <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fairvote.org/assets/Oakland-RCV-Analysis-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-06 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130106162800/http://www.fairvote.org/assets/Oakland-RCV-Analysis-2012.pdf |archive-date=2013-01-06 |url-status = bot: unknown}}</ref>\n\n====San Francisco====\n[[San Francisco]] has used RCV for its Board of Supervisors and most citywide offices nearly every November since 2004.

The winner won 54% of the final round count, which amounted to 48.67% of the total first-round votes, with 9.89% of the ballots exhausted by the final round.\n* District 5: There were 22 candidates, reduced to 3 in 19 rounds, when the winner had a majority of active ballots. The winner finished with 50.6% of the final round vote against two runners up, which amounted to 37.63% of the first-round vote with 25.63% of the ballots exhausted.\n* District 7: There were 13 candidates, reduced to 2 in 11 rounds. The winner finished with 57% of the votes cast for the two active candidates in the final round. Of first round votes, this amounted to 43.72% of the first-round vote, with 23.12% exhausted ballots.\n* District 11: There were 8 candidates, reduced to 2 in 6 rounds. The winner finished with 58% of the final round vote, which amounted to 46.08% of the total first-round vote, with 21.01% of the ballots exhausted.\n\nThe District 5 results are included below as the largest election from 2004 and the one with the most rounds of counting. The elimination table shows the candidates reordered by their elimination. The elimination process was stable for the highest 5 candidates, holding their same plurality ranking each round despite the 19 rounds of elimination and transfer votes.\n\nThe RCV elimination process was halted when candidate Mirkarimi reached more than 50% of the active ballots, but only 37.6% of the total first-round ballots.

Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]], AOC-in-C (Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief) Bomber Command, believed that \"We can wreck Berlin from end to end if the USAAF come in with us. It will cost us between 400 and 500 aircraft. It will cost Germany the war\".{{sfnm|1a1=Brown|1y=1999|1p=309|2a1=Grayling|2y=2006|2p=62}}\n\nHarris could expect about 800 serviceable heavy bombers for each raid, equipped with new and sophisticated navigational devices such as [[H2S radar]]. The USAAF, having recently lost many aircraft in attacks on [[Schweinfurt#World War II|Schweinfurt]], did not participate. The Main Force of Bomber Command attacked Berlin sixteen times but failed in its object of inflicting a decisive defeat on Germany. The [[Royal Air Force]] lost more than 7,000 aircrew and 1,047 bombers, 5.1 per cent of the sorties flown; 1,682 aircraft were damaged or written off.{{sfnm|1a1=Bishop|1y=2007|1p=216|2a1=Kitchen|2y=1990|2p=136}} On 30 March 1944, Bomber Command attacked [[Nuremberg]] with 795 aircraft, 94 of which were shot down and 71 were damaged.{{sfn|Hastings|1979|p=261}} The [[Luftwaffe]]'s [[1st Fighter Corps (Germany)|I. Jagdkorps]] recorded the loss of 256 [[night fighter]]s from November 1943 to March 1944.{{sfn|Hooton|1999|p=262}}\n\nThe {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} retaliated with {{lang|de|[[Operation Steinbock|Unternehmen Steinbock]]}} (Operation Capricorn) against [[London]] and other British cities from January to May 1944. The {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} managed to accumulate 524 bombers but {{lang|de|Steinbock}} caused little damage for the loss of 329 aircraft, a greater percentage loss per raid and overall than that suffered by Bomber Command over Germany.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=414\u2013415}}\n\nThere were many other air [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|raids on Berlin]] by the RAF, the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[Eighth Air Force]] and Soviet bombers. The RAF was granted a [[battle honour]] for the bombardment of Berlin by aircraft of Bomber Command from 1940 to 1945.{{sfn|RAFS|2004f|loc=Battle Honours}}\n\n==Battle==\nThe first Bomber Command raid of the battle occurred on the night of [[November 18|18/19 November]] 1943. Berlin was attacked by 440 [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bombers of the Main Force and four [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s but the city was under cloud and the damage was not severe. The second raid by the Main Force took place on the night of 22/23 November. This was the most effective raid on Berlin by the RAF of the war, causing extensive damage to the residential areas west of the centre, [[Tiergarten (Berlin)|Tiergarten]] and [[Charlottenburg]], [[Sch\u00f6neberg]] and [[Spandau]]. Because of dry weather, several [[firestorm]]s ignited. The Protestant [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]], now a war memorial and the [[New Synagogue (Berlin)|New Synagogue]] (used as a store house by the ''Wehrmacht'') were badly damaged in the raid.{{sfn|K\u00fchne|Stephani|1986|p=34}}{{sfn|Simon|1992|p=144}}\n\nIn the next nights, further attacks followed, damaging or destroying [[Bethlehem's Church (Friedrichstadt)|Bethlehem's Church]], [[John's Church (Berlin-Moabit)|John's Church]], [[Lietzow Church]], [[Holy Trinity Church (Berlin)|Trinity Church]], [[Kaiser-Friedrich-Ged\u00e4chtniskirche|Emperor Frederick Memorial Church]], [[Kirche am Hohenzollernplatz]] and [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]]. Several other buildings of note were either destroyed or damaged, including the British, French, Italian and Japanese embassies, [[Charlottenburg Palace]], [[Berlin Zoo]], the Ministry of Munitions, the ''[[Waffen SS]]'' Administrative College, the barracks of the [[Imperial Guard]] at Spandau and several arms factories.{{sfn|RAFS|2004b|loc=December}}\n\nOn 17 December, extensive damage was done to the Berlin railway system. By this time the cumulative effect of the bombing campaign had made more than a quarter of Berlin's living accommodation unusable.{{sfn|RAFS|2004b|loc=December}} There was another Main Force raid on the night of 28/29 January 1944, when the western and southern districts were hit in the most concentrated attack of this period.  On 15/16 February, important war industries were hit, including the large [[Siemensstadt]] area in the west, with the centre and south-western districts receiving most of the damage. This was the largest raid by the RAF on Berlin; the campaign continued until March 1944.{{sfn|RAFS|2004b|loc=December}}{{sfn|RAFS|2004c|loc=January}}{{sfn|RAFS|2004d|loc=February}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Analysis===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1985-1108-514, Berlin, besch\u00e4digte St. Hedwigs-Kathedrale.jpg|thumb|The ruins of St. Hedwig's Cathedral, 1946]]\nIn 1961, the British official historians, [[Charles Webster (historian)|Charles Webster]] and [[Noble Frankland]] wrote that Bomber Command sent {{nowrap|16 raids}} with {{nowrap|9,111 sorties}} on Berlin. The attacks cost {{nowrap|492 aircraft,}} their crews killed or captured and {{nowrap|954 aircraft}} damaged, a rate of loss of 5.8 per cent, exceeding the 5 per cent threshold that was considered by the RAF to be the maximum sustainable operational loss rate.{{sfn|Webster|Frankland|1961|p=198}} The Battle of Berlin diverted German military resources from the land war and had an economic effect in physical damage, worker fatalities and injuries, relocation and fortification of industrial buildings and other infrastructure but by 1 April 1944, the campaign had failed to force a German capitulation,\n\n{{quote|...in the operational sense the Battle of Berlin was more than a failure, it was a defeat....The Battle of Berlin compared unfavourably with the preceding Battles of the Ruhr and of Hamburg and the campaign on the road to Berlin.{{sfn|Webster|Frankland|1961|pp=193\u2013194}}}}\n\nIn 2004, Daniel Oakman wrote that,\n\n{{quote|Bomber Command lost 2,690 men over Berlin, and nearly 1,000 more became prisoners of war. Of Bomber Command's total losses for the war, around seven per cent were incurred during the Berlin raids. In December 1943, eleven crews from [[No. 460 Squadron RAAF|460 Squadron]] (RAAF) were lost in operations against Berlin; in January and February [1944], another 14 crews were killed. Having 25 aircraft destroyed meant that the full complement of aircraft and crews had lasted three months. At this rate Bomber Command would have been destroyed before Berlin.{{sfn|Oakman|2004|nopp=y}}}}\n\nHarris had predicted the loss of {{nowrap|500 aircraft}} and Oakman wrote \"...it would be wrong to say that it was, in a strategic sense, a wasted effort. Bombing brought the war to Germany at a time when it was difficult to apply pressure anywhere else\".{{sfn|Oakman|2004|nopp=y}} In 2005, Kevin Wilson wrote that, despite the devastation of Berlin, the British raids failed to achieve their objectives. The bombing prevented increases in German production and caused resources to be diverted from offensive to defensive purposes but German civilian morale did not break. The Berlin defences and essential services were maintained and war production in greater Berlin did not fall.{{sfn|Wilson|2005|p=441}}\n\nIn 2006, [[Adam Tooze]], an economic historian, wrote that the British bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 appeared to vindicate the hopes of the British leaders in Bomber Command, that it had become a decisive weapon and that the theory of strategic bombing had been vindicated. Bomber Command was only able to emulate the Hamburg firestorm of 28 July once, at Kassel in October. In the winter of 1943, the attacks on Berlin began, which Tooze called ''fruitless'',\n\n{{quote|The Ruhr was the choke point and in 1943 it was within the RAF's grip. The failure to maintain that hold and to tighten it was a tragic operational error.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=602}}}}\n\nBerlin was a big manufacturing city but the Ruhr was the principal supplier of coal and steel to Germany. Isolating the Ruhr could strangle the rest of the German war economy; in the campaign against Berlin, the British caused much damage but the evolution of German anti-aircraft defences, particularly night fighters, was able to counter the Bomber Command threat on its long flights to Berlin in winter weather.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=601\u2013602, 615}}\n\n===German casualties===\nThe Battle of Berlin caused immense loss of life and devastation in Berlin. The 22 November 1943 raid killed 2,000 Berliners and rendered 175,000 homeless. The following night, 1,000 people were killed and 100,000 bombed out. During December and January, Main Force raids killed hundreds of people and rendered between 20,000 and 80,000 homeless each night.{{sfn|Grayling|2006|pp=309\u2013310}} In 1982, Laurenz Demps collated loss data using the damage reports of the Berlin police commissioner (''Polizeipr\u00e4sident'') issued after each air raid, descriptions of losses and damage indicated by houses and distributed to 100\u2013150 organisations and administrations busy with rescue, repair, planning and other matters, against reports of the main bureau for air raid protection (''Hauptluftschutzstelle'') of the city of Berlin, which issued more than 100 copies with variable frequency, each summarising losses and damage by the number of air raids; the war diary of the air raid warning command (''Luftwarnkommando'' \u2013 [[Wako Berlin]]), a branch of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and other sources. Demps wrote that 7,480 people had been killed, 2,194 people were reported missing, 17,092 were injured and 817,730 Berliners made homeless.{{sfn|Demps|2014|p=23}} In 2003, Reinhard R\u00fcrup wrote that nearly 4,000 people were killed, 10,000 injured and 450,000 made homeless.{{sfn|R\u00fcrup|2003|p=11}} In 2005, Kevin Wilson described the effect of smoke and dust in the air from the bombing and long periods spent in shelters gave rise to symptoms that were called cellar influenza (''Kellergrippe'').{{sfn|Wilson|2005|p=433}}\n\n==Chronology==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}<!--most of this list is not cited-->\n* <!--1-->Night of 18/19 November 1943: Berlin, the main target, was attacked by 440 Avro Lancasters and four de Havilland Mosquitos, of which 402 bombed the city, which was under cloud.

Because of the dry weather conditions, several 'firestorms' were caused. 175,000 people were made homeless and the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church (''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged\u00e4chtniskirche'') was destroyed. Several other buildings of note were either damaged or destroyed, including the British, French, Italian and Japanese embassies, Charlottenburg Castle and Berlin Zoo. Also the Ministry of Weapons and Munitions, the ''Waffen-SS'' Administrative College, the barracks of the Imperial Guard at Spandau, as well as several factories employed in the manufacture of material for the armed forces.\n* <!--3-->Night of 23/24 November 1943: Berlin, the main target, was attacked by 365 Lancasters, 10 Halifaxes, eight Mosquitos (383 aircraft).{{sfn|Ashworth|1995|p=88}}\n* Night of 24/25 November 1943: Berlin was attacked by six Mosquitos (one lost); nine [[Vickers Wellington]]s dropping leaflets over France.\n* Night of 25/26 November 1943: [[Frankfurt-am-Main|Frankfurt]] was the main target for 236 Halifaxes and 26 Lancasters (262 aircraft).

The Mosquitos were used to lay [[Chaff (countermeasure)|Window]] ahead of the Pathfinder aircraft to draw [[flak]] away from them but due to a temporarily clear sky, 21 aircraft were lost to AA guns over Berlin. Most of the damage was in the semi-industrial suburb of [[Reinickendorf]] but the city centre and the ''Siemensstadt'' (with its many electrical equipment factories), was also hit. [[Stuttgart]] was raided by 157 Halifaxes and 21 Lancasters as a diversion. Both forces flew the same route almost as far as Frankfurt which {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} fighter controllers identified as the RAF target. The total sorties for the night, including minelaying operations, was 666 with 34 aircraft (5.1 per cent) lost. Losses over Berlin was high and combined with landing accidents in fog in England, reached 9.3 per cent. The [[Alkett|Alkett factory]], a big producer of [[armoured fighting vehicles]], was badly hit and Goebbels described it as \"almost completely destroyed\" and referred to \"virtually irreplaceable tools and machines\" being out of action in his diary.{{sfn|Wilson|2005|pp=411\u2013412}}\n* Night of 28/29 November 1943: [[Essen]] was attacked by 10 Mosquitos.\n* Night of 29/30 November 1943: [[Bochum]], [[Cologne]] and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], attacked by 21 Mosquitos.\n* Night of 30/1 December 1943: Essen attacked by four Mosquitos.\n<!-- not part of berlin campaign* Night of 1/2 December 1943: minelaying only.{{sfn|RAFS|2004b|loc=December}} -->\n* <!--5-->Night of 2/3 December 1943: Berlin, the main target, was attacked by 425 Lancasters, 18 Mosquitos and 15 Halifaxes. The Germans identified Berlin as the target.

The bombing was inaccurate and to the south of the city but two more of the [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] factories, a ball-bearing factory and several railway installations were damaged.\n* Night of 3/4 December 1943: [[Leipzig]], the main target, was attacked by 307 Lancasters, 220 Halifaxes (527 aircraft).

German night fighters were directed to intercept the bombers; 25 Lancasters, 5.2 per cent of the Lancaster force, were lost over enemy occupied territory and 29 aircraft were lost on landing in England due to very low cloud. The raid was unusual in that losses due to bad weather over England were greater than losses due to flak or enemy night fighters.{{sfn|Ashworth|1995|p=88}}  The damage to the Berlin railway system was extensive and 1,000 wagon-loads of war material destined for the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] were held up for six days. The National Theatre and the building housing Germany's military and political archives were both destroyed. The effect of the bombing campaign had made unusable more than a quarter of the living accommodation in Berlin. Two Beaufighters and two Mosquitos of [[No. 141 Squadron RAF]] using [[Serrate radar detector]]s managed to damage a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]], the first successful 'Serrate' patrol. On the same night there was other raids on [[Tilley-le-Haut]] and [[Flixecourt]], two flying-bomb sites near [[Abbeville]]. The raid failed to destroy the sites but no aircraft were lost.\n* Night of 19/20 December 1943: leafleting over French towns without loss.\n* Night of 20/21 December 1943: Frankfurt was attacked by 390 Lancasters, 257 Halifaxes and three Mosquitos (650 aircraft). German night fighters got into the bomber stream; 27 Halifaxes and 14 Lancasters were lost, 6.3 per cent of the force. Damage was more than the RAF thought at the time  because they knew that the Germans had lit decoy fires, which had some success as diversions. There was a decoy raid on Mannheim by 54 aircraft and a precision attack by eight Lancasters of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|617 Squadron]] and 8 Pathfinder Mosquitos, on an armaments factory near Liege that failed to hit the target.\n* Night of 21/22 December 1943: [[Mannesmann]] factory at D\u00fcsseldorf attacked by nine Mosquitos and a number of other small raids.\n* Night of 22/23 December 1943: 51 aircraft attacked two flying-bomb sites between Abbeville and [[Amiens]].

There were also minor raids on other cities.\n* Night of 3/4 January 1944: [[Solingen]] and Essen attacked by eight Mosquitos; no losses.\n* Night of 4/5 January 1944: Two flying bomb sites attacked by 80 aircraft. Berlin raided by 13 Mosquitos; small raids on other targets. Flights for the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) were flown, delivering supplies and agents to resistance forces.\n* Night of 5/6 January 1944: [[Szczecin|Stettin]] was the main target for the first time since September 1941, for 348 Lancasters and 10 Halifaxes. A diversionary raid by 13 Mosquitos on Berlin and 25 to four other targets spoofed the night fighters and RAF losses were only 16 aircraft, 4.5 per cent of the force.\n* Night of 6/7 January 1944: Small raids on Duisburg, [[Bristillerie]], [[Dortmund]] and Solingen by 19 Mosquitos.\n* Night of 7/8 January 1944: Small raids on [[Krefeld]] and Duisburg by 11 Mosquitos.

German authorities reported only 10 houses destroyed and 14 people killed in Brunswick with some damage and loss of life in villages to the south. 82 aircraft attacked flying bomb sites at [[Ailly, Eure|Ailly]], [[Bonneton]] and Bristillerie without loss; 17 Mosquitos raided [[Magdeburg]] and Berlin.\n* <!--11-->Night of 20/21 January 1944: Berlin was the target; 495 Lancasters, 264 Halifaxes, 10 Mosquitos (769 aircraft) were dispatched; 22 Halifaxes and 13 Lancasters were lost, 4.6 per cent of the force. The damage could not be assessed due to low cloud the next day.\n* Night of 21/22 January 1944: Magdeburg was the main target for 421 Lancasters, 224 Halifaxes, 3 Mosquitoes (648 aircraft); 57 were lost.

Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]], AOC-in-C (Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief) Bomber Command, believed that \"We can wreck Berlin from end to end if the USAAF come in with us. It will cost us between 400 and 500 aircraft. It will cost Germany the war\".{{sfnm|1a1=Brown|1y=1999|1p=309|2a1=Grayling|2y=2006|2p=62}}\n\nHarris could expect about 800 serviceable heavy bombers for each raid, equipped with new and sophisticated navigational devices such as [[H2S radar]]. The USAAF, having recently lost many aircraft in attacks on [[Schweinfurt#World War II|Schweinfurt]], did not participate. The Main Force of Bomber Command attacked Berlin sixteen times but failed in its object of inflicting a decisive defeat on Germany. The [[Royal Air Force]] lost more than 7,000 aircrew and 1,047 bombers, 5.1 per cent of the sorties flown; 1,682 aircraft were damaged or written off.{{sfnm|1a1=Bishop|1y=2007|1p=216|2a1=Kitchen|2y=1990|2p=136}} On 30 March 1944, Bomber Command attacked [[Nuremberg]] with 795 aircraft, 94 of which were shot down and 71 were damaged.{{sfn|Hastings|1979|p=261}} The [[Luftwaffe]]'s [[1st Fighter Corps (Germany)|I.

The second raid by the Main Force took place on the night of 22/23 November. This was the most effective raid on Berlin by the RAF of the war, causing extensive damage to the residential areas west of the centre, [[Tiergarten (Berlin)|Tiergarten]] and [[Charlottenburg]], [[Sch\u00f6neberg]] and [[Spandau]]. Because of dry weather, several [[firestorm]]s ignited. The Protestant [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]], now a war memorial and the [[New Synagogue (Berlin)|New Synagogue]] (used as a store house by the ''Wehrmacht'') were badly damaged in the raid.{{sfn|K\u00fchne|Stephani|1986|p=34}}{{sfn|Simon|1992|p=144}}\n\nIn the next nights, further attacks followed, damaging or destroying [[Bethlehem's Church (Friedrichstadt)|Bethlehem's Church]], [[John's Church (Berlin-Moabit)|John's Church]], [[Lietzow Church]], [[Holy Trinity Church (Berlin)|Trinity Church]], [[Kaiser-Friedrich-Ged\u00e4chtniskirche|Emperor Frederick Memorial Church]], [[Kirche am Hohenzollernplatz]] and [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]]. Several other buildings of note were either destroyed or damaged, including the British, French, Italian and Japanese embassies, [[Charlottenburg Palace]], [[Berlin Zoo]], the Ministry of Munitions, the ''[[Waffen SS]]'' Administrative College, the barracks of the [[Imperial Guard]] at Spandau and several arms factories.{{sfn|RAFS|2004b|loc=December}}\n\nOn 17 December, extensive damage was done to the Berlin railway system. By this time the cumulative effect of the bombing campaign had made more than a quarter of Berlin's living accommodation unusable.{{sfn|RAFS|2004b|loc=December}} There was another Main Force raid on the night of 28/29 January 1944, when the western and southern districts were hit in the most concentrated attack of this period.  On 15/16 February, important war industries were hit, including the large [[Siemensstadt]] area in the west, with the centre and south-western districts receiving most of the damage. This was the largest raid by the RAF on Berlin; the campaign continued until March 1944.{{sfn|RAFS|2004b|loc=December}}{{sfn|RAFS|2004c|loc=January}}{{sfn|RAFS|2004d|loc=February}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Analysis===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1985-1108-514, Berlin, besch\u00e4digte St. Hedwigs-Kathedrale.jpg|thumb|The ruins of St. Hedwig's Cathedral, 1946]]\nIn 1961, the British official historians, [[Charles Webster (historian)|Charles Webster]] and [[Noble Frankland]] wrote that Bomber Command sent {{nowrap|16 raids}} with {{nowrap|9,111 sorties}} on Berlin.

Of Bomber Command's total losses for the war, around seven per cent were incurred during the Berlin raids. In December 1943, eleven crews from [[No. 460 Squadron RAAF|460 Squadron]] (RAAF) were lost in operations against Berlin; in January and February [1944], another 14 crews were killed. Having 25 aircraft destroyed meant that the full complement of aircraft and crews had lasted three months. At this rate Bomber Command would have been destroyed before Berlin.{{sfn|Oakman|2004|nopp=y}}}}\n\nHarris had predicted the loss of {{nowrap|500 aircraft}} and Oakman wrote \"...it would be wrong to say that it was, in a strategic sense, a wasted effort. Bombing brought the war to Germany at a time when it was difficult to apply pressure anywhere else\".{{sfn|Oakman|2004|nopp=y}} In 2005, Kevin Wilson wrote that, despite the devastation of Berlin, the British raids failed to achieve their objectives. The bombing prevented increases in German production and caused resources to be diverted from offensive to defensive purposes but German civilian morale did not break. The Berlin defences and essential services were maintained and war production in greater Berlin did not fall.{{sfn|Wilson|2005|p=441}}\n\nIn 2006, [[Adam Tooze]], an economic historian, wrote that the British bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 appeared to vindicate the hopes of the British leaders in Bomber Command, that it had become a decisive weapon and that the theory of strategic bombing had been vindicated. Bomber Command was only able to emulate the Hamburg firestorm of 28 July once, at Kassel in October. In the winter of 1943, the attacks on Berlin began, which Tooze called ''fruitless'',\n\n{{quote|The Ruhr was the choke point and in 1943 it was within the RAF's grip. The failure to maintain that hold and to tighten it was a tragic operational error.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=602}}}}\n\nBerlin was a big manufacturing city but the Ruhr was the principal supplier of coal and steel to Germany. Isolating the Ruhr could strangle the rest of the German war economy; in the campaign against Berlin, the British caused much damage but the evolution of German anti-aircraft defences, particularly night fighters, was able to counter the Bomber Command threat on its long flights to Berlin in winter weather.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=601\u2013602, 615}}\n\n===German casualties===\nThe Battle of Berlin caused immense loss of life and devastation in Berlin. The 22 November 1943 raid killed 2,000 Berliners and rendered 175,000 homeless. The following night, 1,000 people were killed and 100,000 bombed out. During December and January, Main Force raids killed hundreds of people and rendered between 20,000 and 80,000 homeless each night.{{sfn|Grayling|2006|pp=309\u2013310}} In 1982, Laurenz Demps collated loss data using the damage reports of the Berlin police commissioner (''Polizeipr\u00e4sident'') issued after each air raid, descriptions of losses and damage indicated by houses and distributed to 100\u2013150 organisations and administrations busy with rescue, repair, planning and other matters, against reports of the main bureau for air raid protection (''Hauptluftschutzstelle'') of the city of Berlin, which issued more than 100 copies with variable frequency, each summarising losses and damage by the number of air raids; the war diary of the air raid warning command (''Luftwarnkommando'' \u2013 [[Wako Berlin]]), a branch of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and other sources.

The effect of the bombing campaign had made unusable more than a quarter of the living accommodation in Berlin.

To flash, one needs to perform a series of actions involving several hardware and software tools to be successful. OpenOCD is a very popular software tool that plays an important role in this \"flashing procedure\". Aside from flashing, OpenOCD can also be used to '''\"debug\"''' the firmware. For that purpose engineers typically connect a [[GNU Debugger|GDB client]] to OpenOCD.\n\nA good way to understand OpenOCD's role in flashing and debugging firmware on microcontrollers, is to investigate the \"flashing procedure\" in more detail.\n\n=== The flashing procedure ===\nAbsolutely nothing happens when you switch on a new empty microcontroller, because there is simply no code in its Flash memory. The USB port, serial port, ethernet link - or whatever connectivity your chip supports - won't do anything. However, there is one exception: the JTAG (and/or SWD) link to your microcontroller is always intact. This protocol is burned in the silicon. So even an 'empty' microcontroller receives and processes JTAG (and/or SWD) commands. That's why you typically use JTAG (or SWD) to flash the firmware.\n\nIn theory, you can put a [[bootloader]] in your firmware. This way you only need to flash the firmware once with JTAG (or SWD), and you can flash new firmware using the bootloader. However, it is customary to just use JTAG (or SWD) to flash repeatedly during firmware development.\n\nTo actually send the JTAG (or SWD) commands to a microcontroller, you need a '''\"flash/debug probe\"'''. This probe can be a separate device that you connect to the JTAG (or SWD) pins on the microcontroller through a connector. However, some circuit boards have an on-board flash/debug probe right next to the microcontroller. The connection to the JTAG (or SWD) pins is therefore hard-wired on the circuit board.\n\nThe flash/debug probe usually has a USB connector to connect to your computer. Before using it, you'll need to install the USB driver first, which you should download from the website of the probe manufacturer.\n\nOnce the probe is properly installed on your computer and connected to the correct pins on the microcontrollers, you can start OpenOCD. Assuming you've got OpenOCD installed, you can start it this way from your console:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\n    $openocd -f openocd_probe.cfg -f openocd_chip.cfg -s <OCDSCRIPTS_LOC> -c \"init; reset halt\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe files \"openocd_probe.cfg\" and \"openocd_chip.cfg\" are configuration files that describe your probe and microcontroller respectively. You should find these files for your specific microcontroller and probe in the \"scripts\" folder within your OpenOCD installation. Pass these files with the `-f` flag to OpenOCD at startup. Also pass the location to the OpenOCD \"scripts\" folder with the `-s` flag. Finally, you can pass some commands with the `-c` flag that OpenOCD should immediately execute when started.\n\nOpenOCD has no graphical user interface. When it's started, you should see some output in the console telling you if the connection to the microcontroller was successful or not. If successful, OpenOCD starts a \"GDB server\" on TCP port 3333 and a \"Telnet server\" on TCP port 4444 in the background.\n\nOpen a second console and start a Telnet client:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\n    $telnet 127.0.0.1 4444\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn Windows you might need to enable Telnet first:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">\n    > dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetClient\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nYou can send your executable `.bin` or `.elf` file through the Telnet client session to OpenOCD, and instruct OpenOCD to flash it to the chip. You can do something similar with a GDB client.\n\n[[File:Openocd.png|thumb|The procedure to flash firmware to a microcontroller, using OpenOCD.]]\n\n== Debugging with OpenOCD and GDB ==\n\n[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n[[Category:Debuggers]]\n[[Category:Free software]]\n\n{{free-software-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{primary sources|date=July 2019}}\n\n{{Infobox software\n| name = OpenOCD\n| logo = <!-- Image name is enough. -->\n| logo alt = \n| logo caption = \n| screenshot = <!-- Image name is enough. -->\n| screenshot size =\n| screenshot alt = \n| caption = \n| collapsible = <!-- Any text here will collapse the screenshot. -->\n| author = Dominic Rath<ref>{{cite web |title=About OpenOCD |url=http://openocd.org/about/ |website=openocd.org |accessdate=4 April 2019}}</ref>\n| developer = Paul Fertser, \u00d8yvind Harboe, Spencer Oliver\n| released = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| discontinued = no\n| ver layout = <!-- simple (default) or stacked -->\n| latest release version = 0.10.0\n| latest release date = {{Start date and age|2017|01|22|df=yes}}<ref>{{cite web |title=OpenOCD 0.10.0 release is out |url=http://openocd.org/2017/01/openocd-0-10-0-release-is-out/ |website=Open On-Chip Debugger |accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref>\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| repo = https://sourceforge.net/p/openocd/code/\n| programming language = [[C (programming language)|C]]\n| operating system = [[Unix-like]], [[Microsoft Windows]]<ref>{{cite web |title=GNU MCU Eclipse OpenOCD |url=https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/openocd/releases |website=GitHub.com |accessdate=4 April 2019}}</ref>\n| platform = \n| size = \n| language = \n| language count = <!-- Number only -->\n| language footnote = \n| genre = \n| license = [[GPL#Version_2|GPLv2]]\n| alexa = \n| website = http://openocd.org\n| standard = \n| AsOf = \n}}\n\n'''OpenOCD''' is a [[free software]] [[In-circuit_emulation#On-chip_debugging|on-chip debugging]], [[in-system programming]] and [[Boundary scan|boundary-scan]] testing tool for various [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] and [[RISC-V]] [[microcontroller|microcontrollers]].<ref>{{cite web |title=OpenOCD User\u2019s Guide |url=http://openocd.org/doc/pdf/openocd.pdf |website=openocd.org |accessdate=4 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Why your hardware needs an open source debugger |url=https://opensource.com/life/15/5/open-source-on-chip-debugger |website=opensource.com |accessdate=4 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== What is OpenOCD used for? ==\nWriting firmware code (usually a binary or hex-file) to a microcontroller is called '''\"flashing\"'''.

The movie won a fourth place prize [[Laurel Award]] in the category Top Musical of 1965. It  featured the song \"[[Puppet on a String (Elvis Presley song)|Puppet on a String]]\", which reached #14 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot 100, #3 on the Adult Contemporary chart and in Canada, and was certified Gold by the [[RIAA]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Nightclub singer]] Rusty Wells (Presley) and his band have just closed their engagement at the club where they work in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], and are just about ready to leave for their annual spring break trip to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]\u2014that is, until the club's owner, Big Frank ([[Harold Stone]]), extends their stay at his club, foiling the band's plans for some sun and fun in Florida.\n\nAt the same time, Big Frank's daughter, college student Valerie ([[Shelley Fabares]]) also takes her spring break in Lauderdale with her friends, which worries her father to no end. So at the suggestion of Rusty (who sees this situation as an opportunity for him and the guys to make Lauderdale after all), Big Frank hires Rusty and his band to make the trip to Lauderdale to look after Valerie to make sure she stays out of trouble.
